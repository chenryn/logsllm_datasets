# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

The terminal should support ZModem for file uploads and downloads. ZModem is a seamless and efficient protocol that allows for the transfer of files up to 4GB in size directly within a terminal session, eliminating the need for additional tools.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

To implement this feature, we will add support for the ZModem protocol. This will involve:

1. **Integration with Terminal Emulator:**
   - Integrate ZModem support into the terminal emulator to enable the detection and handling of ZModem transfers.
   
2. **Backend Support:**
   - Ensure the backend server or service can recognize and process ZModem requests, facilitating the upload and download of files.

3. **User Interface Enhancements:**
   - Provide clear indicators and status updates in the terminal interface to inform users about the progress of file transfers.
   
4. **Error Handling and Recovery:**
   - Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable file transfers, even in the event of network interruptions or other issues.

By adding ZModem support, we aim to provide a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for file transfers within the terminal environment.
