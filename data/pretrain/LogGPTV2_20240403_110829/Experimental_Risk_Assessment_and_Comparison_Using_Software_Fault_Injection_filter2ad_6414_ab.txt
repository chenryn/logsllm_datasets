### 2.1. Multivariate Logistic Regression Model

Using the logit function, it is possible to derive a simple form of a multivariate logistic regression model based on the relationship presented in Equation (3). This model can incorporate several independent variables, which, in our case, are static metrics.

\[
\log \left( \frac{\text{prob}}{1 - \text{prob}} \right) = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n
\]
(3)

To estimate the probability of a fault (\(\text{prob}(f)\)), we need to identify the relevant metrics. The choice of metrics depends on system characteristics, operational profile, risk type, and the specific aspects being evaluated. When multiple metrics are available, we must select the most suitable ones for evaluating software complexity.

One commonly used metric is the size of the component in terms of lines of code (LoC). LoC is a direct measure of software complexity and is one of the first and most common forms of software complexity measurement. In our study, LoC was combined with empirical fault density data provided by Rome Laboratory [33]. We also considered cyclomatic complexity (\(V_g\)) as a regressor for \(\text{prob}(f)\). \(V_g\) measures the control flow complexity of a program and is dependent on the number of predicates (e.g., if, while, etc.). It is a widely used and language-independent metric.

The accuracy of the results from initial experiments was evaluated using bug reports from open-source software initiatives [29]. Based on this study, we added new metrics to better approximate the estimated fault density compared to observed bugs: number of parameters, number of returns, maximum nesting depth, program length, and vocabulary size [14]. Halstead's metrics and \(V_g\) measure distinct program attributes, leading to improved fault prediction capability [24].

Given six metrics, the probability that a component has a residual fault (\(\text{prob}(f(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6))\)) can be expressed as in Equation (4):

\[
\text{prob}(f) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp \left( -(\alpha + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_6 X_6) \right)}
\]
(4)

In this equation, \(X_i\) represents the product metrics (independent variables), and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta_i\) are the estimated logistic regression coefficients.

To obtain the coefficients for logistic regression [16], we follow these steps:
- Evaluate the complexity metrics of each module.
- Adopt fault density ranges accepted by the industry community as a preliminary estimation of fault densities. We use the empirical fault density reported by Rome Laboratory [33] as a starting point.
- Use the binomial distribution, considering the probability of a fault as 0.1 fault per KLoC and LoC metric for each module. This gives the number of lines with residual faults in module \(i\) as a binomial random variable with parameters \(\text{LoC}_i\) and \(\text{prob}\).
- Apply the regression using the natural logarithm of the preliminary fault density and the chosen metrics.
- Estimate the probability of a fault for each component using the computed coefficients in the logistic equation (4).

For estimating the probability of residual faults in a set of components (e.g., a large component formed by several sub-components), we use the \(\text{prob}(f)\) estimated for each sub-component, combined with the complexity weight of each sub-component in the global component. This is given by Equation (5):

\[
\text{prob}(f) = \sum \left( \text{Metrics}_i \times \text{prob}(f_i) \right)
\]
(5)

where \(\text{Metrics}_i\) represents any of the available metrics for each component \(i\). One can choose the metric that best represents the system characteristics (e.g., maximum nesting depth if the system has many nested structures).

### 2.2. Failure Cost Estimation Through Injection of Software Faults

We use the G-SWFIT [11] technique to inject software faults. G-SWFIT is based on a set of fault injection operators that reproduce the most common types of high-level software faults directly in the target executable code. These operators were derived from a field study analyzing over 500 real software faults, identifying the most frequent (top-N) types of software faults [11]. Table 1 shows the 12 most frequent types of faults found in [11], which we use in this paper.

| Fault Type | Description | % of Total Observed | ODC Classes |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| MIFS       | Missing "If (cond) { statement(s) }" | 9.96% | Algorithm |
| MFC        | Missing function call | 8.64% | Algorithm |
| MLAC       | Missing "AND EXPR" in expression used as branch condition | 7.89% | Checking |
| MIA        | Missing "if (cond)" surrounding statement(s) | 4.32% | Checking |
| MLPC       | Missing small and localized part of the algorithm | 3.19% | Algorithm |
| MVAE       | Missing variable assignment using an expression | 3.00% | Assignment |
| WLEC       | Wrong logical expression used as branch condition | 3.00% | Checking |
| WVAV       | Wrong value assigned to a value | 2.44% | Assignment |
| MVI        | Missing variable initialization | 2.25% | Assignment |
| MVAV       | Missing variable assignment using a value | 2.25% | Assignment |
| WAEP       | Wrong arithmetic expression used in parameter of function call | 2.25% | Interface |
| WPFV       | Wrong variable used in parameter of function call | 1.50% | Interface |

The locations for fault injection are selected by analyzing the target code using the G-SWFIT tool, which identifies places where a given fault type can realistically exist. For example, the MIFS fault type can only be injected in code locations representing an IF structure. The analysis is based on the translation of high-level constructs into low-level instruction sequences [11].

The distribution of the number of faults injected in each component is based on our previous proposal [29]. For large components with many fault locations, faults are distributed according to the distribution shown in Table 1. For small components, the distribution is approximated as closely as possible.

The evaluation of the cost of component failures is done by injecting one fault at a time. After each fault injection, the cost is measured as the impact of the fault on the entire system. The impact is categorized into the following failure modes:
- **Hang**: The application does not terminate within the predetermined time.
- **Crash**: The application terminates abruptly before the workload is complete.
- **Wrong**: The workload terminates, but the results are incorrect.
- **Correct**: There are no errors, and the result is correct.

Considering the four failure modes, only the "Correct" mode indicates that the system has delivered correct service after the injected fault. However, we retain all four modes to provide more detailed information on the impact of each fault.

When a software fault is injected into a component, it may or may not cause faulty behavior. Furthermore, only a fraction of faults causing erroneous behavior will lead to system failure, depending on the system architecture and operational profile. The cost of a fault is given by:

\[
\text{cost}(f) = \text{prob}(f_a) \times c(\text{failure})
\]
(6)

where \(\text{prob}(f_a)\) is the probability of fault activation, and \(c(\text{failure})\) is the consequence of a failure, such as the probability of a system crash.

### 3. Case Study

We present a case study to demonstrate the experimental risk estimation using our approach. The case study involves a C application implemented for both the RTEMS and RTLinux operating systems, allowing us to assess the risk for each alternative component. The metrics for each software component were obtained using the Resource Standard Metrics [35] and CMT++ tools [41].

The case study is a satellite data handling system called the Command and Data Management System (CDMS). CDMS manages all data transactions between ground systems and a spacecraft. The application was developed in C and runs on two alternative real-time operating systems: RTEMS [36] and RTLinux [23]. This is particularly relevant as it demonstrates how our approach can help developers choose between alternative off-the-shelf components (RTEMS and RTLinux in this case).
