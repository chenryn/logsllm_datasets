### 12.9.3.3. The Working of Hot File Clustering

**Overview:**
`hfsdebug` can display the details and contents (leaf records) of the Hot Files B-Tree. Unlike other HFS+ B-Trees, this B-Tree contains a user data record in its header node, which holds a `HotFilesInfo` structure (defined in `bsd/hfs/hfs_hotfiles.h`).

**Command Example:**
```sh
$ sudo hfsdebug -b hotfile
# HFS+ Hot File Clustering (HFC) B-Tree
...
# User Data Record
magic = 0XFF28FF26
version = 1
duration = 216000 seconds
...
timeleft = 42710 seconds
threshold = 24
maxfileblks = 2560 blocks
maxfilecnt = 1000
tag = CLUSTERED HOT FILES B-TREE
```

**Initialization and Transition:**
When a volume is mounted, `hfs_recording_init()` ensures that it is a root volume, otherwise, it disables Hot File Clustering (HFC). If the Hot Files B-Tree already exists, HFC transitions to the idle stage; otherwise, `hfs_recording_init()` creates a B-Tree and initiates a scan of the Catalog B-Tree. During this scan, HFC performs the following operations for each file record:
- Ignores resource forks and empty data forks.
- Ignores files whose extents are all outside the Hot File area.
- Skips over the two journal files, `/.journal_info_block` and `/.journal`.
- Adds a thread record and a Hot File record to the Hot Files B-Tree for the remaining files, with initial data values set to `HFC_MINIMUM_TEMPERATURE` and `0x3f3f3f3f`, respectively.

**Stages and Transitions:**
- **HFC_DISABLED Stage:** A volume is considered to be in this stage after it is unmounted.
- **Idle Stage:** After the Catalog B-Tree scan, `hfs_recording_init()` places HFC in the idle stage.
- **Recording Stage:** The transition to the recording stage occurs when `hfs_hotfilesync()` calls `hfs_recording_start()`. During this stage, read operations accumulate the number of bytes read for each file, while write operations reset the count to zero.

**Conditions for Recording:**
For HFC to record file temperatures on a volume, the following conditions must be met:
- The volume must not be read-only.
- The volume must be journaled.
- The volume's `hfsmount` structure must indicate that the metadata zone has been established.
- The number of free allocation blocks on the volume must be at least twice the total number of Hot File area blocks possible.

**Constraints Used by HFC:**
| Name | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| HFC_BLKSPERSYNC | 300 | Maximum number of allocation blocks moved during a single sync-triggered HFC operation. |
| HFC_FILESPERSYNC | 50 | Maximum number of files moved during adoption or eviction. |
| HFC_DEFAULT_DURATION | 60 hours | Default temperature-recording duration. |
| HFC_DEFAULT_FILE_COUNT | 1000 | Default number of hot files to track. |
| HFC_MAXIMUM_FILE_COUNT | 5000 | Upper limit on the number of hot files to track. |
| HFC_MAXIMUM_FILESIZE | 10MB | Upper limit on the size of files to track. |
| HFC_MINIMUM_TEMPERATURE | 24 | Threshold temperature for residency in the Hot File area. |

**Evaluation and Adoption/Eviction:**
- **Evaluation Stage:** After the recording period ends, `hfs_recording_stop()` moves to the evaluation stage, where it ages existing records, sorts the runtime recording list by temperature, and updates the B-Tree information for eligible entries.
- **Adoption/Eviction Stage:** Depending on the available free space in the Hot File area, the next HFC stage will be set as either adoption or eviction. `hotfiles_evict()` reclaims space by moving files out of the Hot File area, while `hotfiles_adopt()` moves files into the Hot File area, both subject to the same transfer constraints.

### 12.10. Miscellaneous Features

**Special System Calls:**
- **exchangedata():** Exchanges the data and resource forks of two files, ensuring atomicity.
- **getattrlist() and setattrlist():** Retrieve and set attributes of file system objects, including volumes.
- **getdirentriesattr():** Retrieves file system attributes for items in a given directory.
- **searchfs():** Searches the file system based on various criteria.

**Freezing and Thawing a Volume:**
- **F_FREEZE_FS and F_THAW_FS:** These file control operations allow a superuser process to freeze and thaw a journaled mounted volume, respectively. Freezing stops file system operations and flushes the journal, while thawing releases the global volume lock.

**Extending and Shrinking a Volume:**
- **hfs_extendfs() and hfs_truncatefs():** These kernel-internal functions provide support for growing or shrinking a mounted journaled file system. They can be accessed from user space through `fsctl(2)` or `sysctl(3)`.

**Volume Notifications:**
- **hfs_generate_volume_notifications():** Generates notifications when free space on a volume falls below a warning limit or rises above a minimal desired limit. These limits are stored in the `hfsmount` structure.

**Support for Sparse Devices:**
- **Sparse Disk Images:** HFS+ supports sparse devices, allowing the underlying device to be sparse. This feature is used by Apple's Disk Images framework to create and manage sparse disk images.
