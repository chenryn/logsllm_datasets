Why when I run a sample test on chromium or webkit playwright opens two
browser windows? At the same time firefox opens one window but two tabs. Is it
possible to have only one window?
    const playwright = require('playwright');
    (async () => {
        const browser = await playwright.webkit.launch({headless: false});
        const page = await browser.newPage();
        await page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/');
        await browser.close();
    })();
