### nfsstat

**Overview:**
`nfsstat` is a command-line utility that provides statistical information about the Network File System (NFS) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations. When used without any parameters, `nfsstat` displays all available statistical data without resetting any counters.

**Syntax:**
```sh
nfsstat [-c] [-s] [-n] [-r] [-z] [-m]
```

**Parameters:**

- **-c**: Displays only the client-side NFS and RPC statistics, including calls sent and rejected by the client. To display NFS or RPC information exclusively, combine this flag with `-n` or `-r`.
- **-s**: Displays only the server-side NFS and RPC statistics, including calls sent and rejected by the server. To display NFS or RPC information exclusively, combine this flag with `-n` or `-r`.
- **-m**: Provides information about mount flags set by mount options, internal system mount flags, and other mount-related details.
- **-n**: Shows NFS-related information for both the client and server. To display only client or server NFS information, combine this flag with `-c` or `-s`.
- **-r**: Shows RPC-related information for both the client and server. To display only client or server RPC information, combine this flag with `-c` or `-s`.
- **-z**: Resets the call statistics. This flag is only available to the root user and can be combined with other parameters to reset specific sets of statistics after displaying them.

**Examples:**

1. **Display client-side NFS and RPC call statistics:**
   ```sh
   nfsstat -c
   ```

2. **Display client-side NFS call statistics:**
   ```sh
   nfsstat -cn
   ```

3. **Display RPC call statistics for both the client and server:**
   ```sh
   nfsstat -r
   ```

4. **Display server-side NFS and RPC call statistics:**
   ```sh
   nfsstat -s
   ```

5. **Reset all call-related statistics to zero on both the client and server:**
   ```sh
   nfsstat -z
   ```

This utility is particularly useful for monitoring and troubleshooting NFS and RPC performance in networked environments.
