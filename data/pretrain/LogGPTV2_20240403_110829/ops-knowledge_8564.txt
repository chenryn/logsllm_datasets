User: I am using Python2.6. I am trying to list the disk drives that a system may have. 
On Windows, it may be something like C:/, D:/, E:/, etc. On Linux, it may be something like /boot, /media/SDCard, etc. And I don't know what it's like on a Mac. Maybe something under /Volumes.
Does anyone know of a cross platform way (that is, one which works on Linux, Windows and Mac) in Python?
Thanks!
Assistant: There isn't really a unified naming scheme for Linux devices that guarantees you a formatable block device. There are conventions, but they can vary widely and I can call my thumb-drive /Thomas/O if I want and there is no cross-platform way in Python to know:

That /Thomas/O corresponds to /dev/sdf1
That /dev/sdf1 can have a FAT32 filesystem made on it
That /dev/sdf is not preferred to /dev/sdf1

I'm pretty sure that neither is there a cross-platform Python module which will allow you to determine that H:/ is formattable on a Windows system but that Z:/ is not.
Each system will require its own specific checks and validations which you could best learn from studying open-source disk manipulation software.
