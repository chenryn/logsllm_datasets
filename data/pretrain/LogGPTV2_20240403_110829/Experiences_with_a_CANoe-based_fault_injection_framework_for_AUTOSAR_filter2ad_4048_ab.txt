### Fault Injection Framework for CANoe

#### 1. Introduction
The fault injection framework aims to provide empirical insights into the behavior of AUTOSAR-based systems under various fault conditions. The framework is designed with six specific goals, which are outlined below.

#### 2. Goals of the Fault Injection Framework
- **Observability**: The effects (or lack thereof) of an injected fault should be readily apparent.
- **Portability**: The modifications needed to apply the framework to different AUTOSAR-based applications and to port it between AUTOSAR implementations should be minimal.
- **Flexibility**: The framework should be flexible enough to support a wide range of fault-injection scenarios and fault types.
- **Avoidance of Probe Effects**: It is important for the fault-injection framework to avoid unintended and undesired alterations to the system caused by the fault injection process itself.
- **Error Handling Mechanisms**: The framework should be able to distinguish between a fault that has no effect (e.g., masked by some error-handling mechanism) and a fault that causes a visible effect.
- **Integration with CANoe**: The framework should integrate seamlessly with the CANoe environment, providing a user interface for manual control over the fault-injection process.

#### 3. Fault-Injection Hooks
Fault-injection hooks are defined in the SWIFI DLL and called from the AUTOSAR DLL. Two types of fault-injection hooks are implemented:
- **Suppression Hooks**: These hooks cause errors directly. When a suppression hook is active, it signals the AUTOSAR BSW layers to abort the API call or return an error.
- **Manipulation Hooks**: These hooks manipulate data structures passed to the API. Manipulation hooks can be either modifiable or non-modifiable. Modifiable hooks allow the data structures to be changed, while non-modifiable hooks provide additional context without altering the data.

#### 4. Implementation Details
- **API Call Abortion**: An API call should abort immediately if a suppression hook is active. For manipulation hooks, the target API call will be aborted if the data structures are manipulated.
- **Parameter Definitions**: The SWIFI DLL implements six fault-injection parameters, including the location of the AUTOSAR API call where the fault is to be injected, the argument data structure to be manipulated, and a mask specifying which bytes should be modified.
- **User Interface**: A CANoe panel provides a user interface for manual control over the fault-injection process. This panel modifies CANoe system variables, which are then mapped to fault-injection parameters.

#### 5. Fault-Injection Scenarios
Hooks were added to five AUTOSAR API calls, as shown in Table 1. These hooks are designed to cause low-level FlexRay protocol errors that are then passed to higher layers or onto the FlexRay bus directly.

| AUTOSAR Layer | AUTOSAR API | Description | Manipulated Data |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| System Services | WdgM_UpdateAliveCounter | Notifies the WdgM that a supervised entity is still alive. | Entity identifier |
| Communication Services | Com_SendSignal | Sends data to the RTE as an AUTOSAR signal. | Signal identifier, data buffer |
| Communication Services | Com_ReceiveSignal | Receives data from the RTE as an AUTOSAR signal. | Signal identifier, data buffer |
| Communication Drivers | FrTransmitTxLPdu | Transfers data to the FlexRay controller as a PDU. | Data buffer, buffer length, channel, slot identifier, controller flags |
| Communication Drivers | FrReceiveRxLPdu | Receives data from the FlexRay controller as a PDU. | Data buffer, buffer length, controller flags |

#### 6. Evaluation
The evaluation was conducted using a demo version of CANoe (v7.1, running on Windows XP) and a vendor-supplied implementation of the AUTOSAR 3.0 specification. The application consists of two FlexRay nodes, a single CAN node, and a CANIFlexRay gateway. The CAN node sends throttle and brake inputs through the gateway to the FlexRay nodes, which calculate the front and rear wheel speeds.

#### 7. Lessons Learned
- **Functionality**: The functionality of the framework was mostly satisfactory, demonstrating the ability to inject and visualize faults.
- **Error Handling**: The framework showed promise in testing AUTOSAR error-handling mechanisms, but the lack of application-level error handling could make it more difficult to observe certain faults.
- **Drawbacks**: There were significant drawbacks to using CANoe in this manner, including the need for manual configuration and the potential for probe effects.

This proof-of-concept framework demonstrated the potential for effective fault injection in AUTOSAR-based systems, but further refinements are needed to address the identified limitations.
