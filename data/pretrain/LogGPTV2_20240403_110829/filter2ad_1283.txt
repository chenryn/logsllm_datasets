ABSTRACT
The Workshop on Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Security (AISec)
focuses on using Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
Learning methods to address the unique problems posed
within the Security and Privacy application areas and on
the implications of using those methods to solve such adver-
sarial problems. The workshop serves as the premier venue
for this particular fusion of application, algorithms, and the-
ory and continues to attract submissions from a diverse set
of researchers, who address newly arising problems within
this ever growing ﬁeld. The main goal of the workshop is to
provide a forum for researchers within the Security, Privacy,
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning commu-
nities to discuss the role of AI and learning in security and
privacy applications and, conversely, to present the unique
needs of these problems to the AI and learning communi-
ties.

1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
The uses and applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Ma-
chine Learning, and Data Mining for security and privacy
problems continues to grow and diversify. For instance, in
the past year there has been a large surge in the use of Big
Data analytics for security. Machine learning, data mining,
and other artiﬁcial intelligence technologies will play a key
role in extracting knowledge, situational awareness, and se-
curity intelligence from Big Data, and the establishment of
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) sys-
tems. Startups like Click Security, Splunk, IPTrust and es-
tablished organizations like QRadar (recently acquired by
IBM) are already big players in this ﬁeld, which is poised
to continue growing signiﬁcantly in the coming years. Fur-
ther, with the advent of cloud-computing, every advantage
the cloud oﬀers, such as large-scale machine learning and
data-driven abuse detection, is being leveraged to improve
security.
For the past four years, AISec has served and continues
to serve as the primary place for diverse researchers in se-
curity, privacy, AI and machine learning to meet, and as a
venue to develop the fundamental theory and practical ap-
plications supporting the use of machine learning for security
and privacy. The needs of this burgeoning community who
are especially focused on (among other topics) learning in
game-theoretic adversarial environments, privacy-preserving
learning, or use of sophisticated or new learning algorithms
in security is not met anywhere else; and many of the regu-
lar attendees of AISec also wish to attend CCS - both AISec
and CCS thus beneﬁt from their continued co-location. In
2011 the AISec enjoyed an excellent attendance placing it in
the middle of the CCS 2011 workshops by size.
2. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Given the unique blend of security and analytic require-
ments within many emerging applications, the aim of the
AISec workshop is thus to complement mainstream venues
in security and AI in several ways. While a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of research in the security and privacy community
involves machine learning or data analysis, the discussion of
appropriate application of AI is often cut short or omitted
as a detail. It is also rare to ﬁnd new learning algorithms
being proposed for previously identiﬁed problems in main-
stream venues as their focus is (rightly) on new issues in
security. Finally proposed adaptive defenses are not always
evaluated against an active adversary but rather against a

Alvaro A. C´ardena is a research staﬀ engineer with the
Cloud-Based Solutions Innovation Group at Fujitsu Labo-
ratories of America. Prior to this he was a postdoctoral
fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. His research
interests include the use of security analytics, or the applica-
tion of statistics, mathematical models, and machine learn-
ing to solve security problems in computer networks and the
smart grid. As part of the newly-formed cloud computing
group at Fujitsu he is currently focusing on Big Data ana-
lytics and its role for providing security services. He was a
co-organizer of AISec 2011 and is currently a co-organizer
of the IEEE Smart Grid Security and Privacy Symposium
(part of SmartGridComm 2012).
Blaine Nelson is a Humboldt postdoctoral fellow at the
University of T¨ubingen in Germany. Previously he com-
pleted his doctoral studies at the University of California,
Berkeley. While he is broadly interested in practical ap-
plications of machine learning, he particularly concentrates
on assessing and developing resilient techniques for learning
to mitigate threats within systems or security applications.
Blaine was a member of the program committee of AISec
2011 and is currently a co-organizer of a Dagstuhl workshop
entitled Machine Learning Methods for Computer Security
be held in September 2012.
Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein is a researcher at Microsoft
Research, Silicon Valley. Previously he obtained the PhD in
Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2010. His research
focuses on topics in the intersection of security and machine
learning such as adaptive side-channel attacks, risk manage-
ment, evading and manipulating learners used in security-
sensitive environments, and privacy-preserving learning; he
also works on machine learning problems in entity resolu-
tion/record linkage, which has resulted in features shipped
in both the Bing search engine and Xbox360 game console.
Ben is currently on the PC of ICML 2012, and was previ-
ously co-organizer of AISec 2011, and a PC member of the
AISEC 2009, AISEC 2010, PSDML 2010 (security/privacy
at ECML/PKDD) workshops and the ICML 2010 confer-
ence.

ployed.
In addition, privacy-preserving learning is a rich
topic explored in the theory, learning and databases com-
munities but has had less exposure in security. Finally, in
the other direction, security/privacy papers more appropri-
ate for a machine learning venue, or authored by learning
researchers, do not always reach a security audience.
