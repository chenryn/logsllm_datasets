Table 1: Measurements collected by the client in the different topologies with respect to the two candidate APs. Measurements
are reported for AP Capacity (APC), Aggregated Transmission Delay (ATD), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and Ex-
pected Throughput (ET). The last column lists the throughput achieved through the afﬁliation with each candidate AP. Discrepancies
between the last two columns are due to non-saturating loads. Under fully saturated conditions the estimates are accurate.

conducted so far. This is because as long as the difference in RSSI
between the two APs being considered is small, the other metrics
play a dominant role in the choice of the best AP and hence there
is no signiﬁcant impact on the decision reached by the ET metric.
However, when the RSSI difference is large between the two APs
being considered, the absence of rate scaling could potentially force
the ET metric to reach the wrong decision. We highlight this sce-
nario through our ﬁnal experiment.
The topology in Figure 1(e) is the same as in the fourth exper-
iment with a difference in that all trafﬁc is now being sent in the
downlink direction and hence limited to 4 Mbps. Further, since
the APs do not perform rate scaling, the importance of RSSI is in-
creased in this case. Once again C2 connects to AP1 and receives
a CBR trafﬁc stream of 4 Mbps for one minute, after which it con-
nects to AP3 and receives a trafﬁc stream of 4 Mbps for another
minute. The throughputs are noted for each case. The values for
the association metrics for the two APs are further listed in Table
1. The corresponding AP choice made using the different metrics
is listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the RSSI metric leads to
the right decision, while the ET metric fails. The reason is as fol-
lows. First, the AP capacity of AP1 equals that of AP3. Hence,
the client choice is determined by the values of ATD and RSSI.
Further, there is a large difference in RSSI between the two APs
(28 dBm), consequently favoring AP1 with a higher throughput.
Since we are considering downlink, APs do not perform rate adap-
tation. Hence, the transmission delays do not take into account the
impact of lower RSSI. For example, at lower RSSI, a rate scaling
mechanism would reduce the transmission rate from the AP to the
client, thereby increasing the transmission delay. Similarly, the ag-
gregated transmission delay would decrease in the presence of very
good RSSI due to the high transmission rates used. Since such a
feature is missing, the ET metric is unable to make the right deci-
sion. However, if we were to assume that rate scaling is supported
by the APs, AP1 would use a high rate of 11 Mbps for a signal
strength of 40 dBm or less. This means an increase of rate by more
than a factor of 10 (from 11Mbps down to 1 Mbps) or accordingly
a decrease of transmission delay by a factor of 10. When this factor
is incorporated, the ET metric for AP1 turns out to be smaller than
that of AP3, thereby leading to the right decision.
All the experiments conducted thus far corroborate that the ET
metric is in fact a very good indicator of client throughput as long as
rate adaptation based on RSSI is employed and trafﬁc is saturated.
5.2 Limitations: saturated trafﬁc
The ET metric in Equation 2 could be considered to capture user
throughput under the worst case scenario, i.e. the AP is fully satu-
rated, all users require service at all times, and they use a common
data unit size. In other words, by design the ET metric is meant
to capture the minimum throughput the user should expect from an
AP. If other users use smaller packet sizes, their transmission delay
is going to be smaller. Moreover, if not all users require service at
all times then the user can gain access to the medium more often
than what we expect through our model.
In future work we would like to look at the potential of extend-
ing the deﬁnition of the ET metric to capture scenarios that may
not fully abide to the aforementioned assumptions. Modeling user
throughput in non-saturated 802.11 networks, that feature both up-
link and downlink trafﬁc, has only received attention recently [3]
due to the inherent difﬁculty in dealing with a purely randomized
access scheme such as CSMA/CA. In future work we intend to ex-
plore the potential of an analytical model like the one presented
in [3] to drive the design of a measurement scheme that can operate
under non-saturated conditions.
Note that if the total amount of trafﬁc served by the AP still ex-
ceeds the AP capacity, then the ET estimation error is likely to be
small in magnitude. However, if the AP itself is under-utilized then
there is little understanding about how the individual client through-
put can be modeled, how long the client workload should be mea-
sured and what the ultimate optimization criterion should be. If the
individual client workload changes through time, should the user
select the AP that maximizes his/her throughput at the time of the
selection or should he/she rely on some kind of historical measure-
ments?
Similarly, non-saturated trafﬁc can also result in the aggregate

utilization of all co-channel APs to be less than the channel capac-
ity. In such a case, the utilization term should not only include the
fraction of time that is currently being used by the AP, but must also
include the additional fraction of channel capacity that is not being
used by any of the co-channel APs. This could potentially be com-
puted by an AP using information on its own utilization, as well
as utilization information conveyed in the beacon frames of other
co-channel APs. These are some directions we intend to explore in
future work.
6 Summary
Despite the fundamental need for accurate mechanisms for the as-
sociation of 802.11 clients with APs, there has been little work
that addresses the fundamental parameters that should drive such
a process. In [4] the authors discuss the beneﬁts of intelligent AP
selection algorithms, but do not make a solid proposal as to how
different metrics can be used in such a task. In this work we take
a step back and look at the metrics that need to be incorporated
in such a decision. Using an actual implementation we study the
tradeoffs offered by different metrics. We then propose the metric
of “expected throughput” that combines information from the phys-
ical and MAC layer to assist clients in their association decisions.
Our metric relies on the accurate measurement of (i) AP capacity
in the presence of interference, (ii) the aggregated transmission de-
lay of all existing clients, and (iii) the instantaneous transmission
rate of the new client. We modiﬁed the microcode and ﬁrmware of
the Intel 2915ABG card to study their impact in an experimental
testbed. Our results show great promise.
Our approach relies on the advertizement of new metrics in Bea-
con frames. Such a change has been already proposed within the
IEEE 802.15 and 802.11e working groups in the standardization of
the Quality Basic Service Set (QBSS) load metric [1]. The QBSS
load metric comprises 6 elements, capturing among others (i) the
channel utilization (trafﬁc served/capacity), and (ii) the portion of
total time available to a QBSS for non-silent periods under the BSS
overlap mitigation procedure. Nonetheless, no recommendation is
made as to how such metrics can be combined in the selection cri-
terion. We feel that consideration of such metrics by IEEE carries
promise in that future generation 802.11 devices will have the pro-
posed measurement support.
