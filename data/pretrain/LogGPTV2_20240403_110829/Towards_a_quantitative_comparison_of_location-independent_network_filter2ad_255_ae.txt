majority of (unpopular) content is near-zero.
8. LIMITATIONS AND OPEN ISSUES
We began with an ambitious goal but have only managed
to scratch the surface. Below, we list the limitations of our
evaluation, caveats attached to our (cid:12)ndings, and open issues.
The hundreds of users in our device mobility dataset may
not be a representative sample of smartphone users even to-
day, leave alone in a future Internetwork. However, given the

cal mobility) of devices, we believe our measurements are an
important and necessary (cid:12)rst step for developing meaning-
ful mobility datasets in order to compare diﬀerent architec-
tures. An alternative might have been to develop an abstract
model (e.g., the equivalent of a random-waypoint model [56]
for network mobility of devices or content), but this abstract
model would hardly be any more convincing unless validated
through measurements (such as those presented here).
The unrepresentativeness critique applies also to other as-
pects of the data in our evaluation including the use of to-
day’s routing topologies, routing policies, access network di-
versity, content locations, etc. that may be radically diﬀer-
ent in the future and may indeed be in(cid:13)uenced by the very
architectures we seek to evaluate, were they to be widely
adopted. The empirical nature of our evaluation comes with
the necessary caveat that our (cid:12)ndings are limited to network
environments like today’s Internet; but we do note that our
(cid:12)ndings are unlikely to change qualitatively if the extent of
device or content mobility were perturbed by large factors.
Our characterization of content mobility by measuring
the change in resolved IP addresses associated with domain
names implicitly assumes that a purely name-based routing
network will announce content domain names from all of the
locations|including CDN locations|where they resides to-
day. It is possible, even likely, that popular content will be
announced from far fewer primary locations with commensu-
rately less (cid:13)ux in a name-based architecture that can lever-
age on-path caching (as in NDN). However, that would only
strengthen our favorable assessment of name-based routing
for handling the update cost of content mobility. What was
not clear to us when we began this work was whether rout-
ing directly over a hierarchical domain name space would
scale even in today’s Internet; our (cid:12)ndings lean towards the
aﬃrmative (unlike analyses based on abstract models [10]).
Our scope of evaluation as well as goals suﬀer from some
limitations. First, we have evaluated three pure strategies
for location-independence but not the many possible com-
binations of these strategies in a network architecture (e.g.,
exploiting indirection points within a name-based routing
system [27]). Second, network architecture itself is indeed
part science and part art. Not everything may be easily
quanti(cid:12)able; what is easily quanti(cid:12)able may not be the most
pressing concern. Nevertheless, our position is that pushing
the envelope of what is quanti(cid:12)able is valuable for scienti(cid:12)c
discourse, and our work is a (cid:12)rst step towards that goal.
Even within the con(cid:12)nes of the three purist approaches,
our empirical focus constrained the nature of the trade-oﬀs
we could evaluate. For name-based routing, we could empir-
ically evaluate metrics such as update cost and forwarding
table size, but not other control plane metrics such as rout-
ing convergence delays or data plane metrics such as for-
warding traﬃc or user-perceived path stretch with on-path
caching. We note however that on-path content caching can
bene(cid:12)t most architectures, including ones based on name
resolution like the Internet (e.g., transparent caching today)
or MobilityFirst [48], but does not suﬃce to ensure reacha-
bility to at least one copy of the requested content.
Our methodology considers one class of controlled (cid:13)ooding
strategies that generalize routing and forwarding strategies
used in today’s Internet. However, as noted in x3.3.3, the
fungibility of costs between update cost, forwarding table
size, and forwarding traﬃc allows for other exotic architec-
tural alternatives whose cost-bene(cid:12)t trade-oﬀs are harder to
analyze. Investigating these more sophisticated forwarding
strategies is an interesting avenue of future research, as also
alluded to by calls for a stateful forwarding plane [55].
9. CONCLUSIONS
The intellectual pursuit of a location-independent com-
munication abstraction has long intrigued networking re-
searchers, and has in no small part in(cid:13)uenced the design
of many clean-slate Internet architectures. However, despite
sharing this common goal, there has been little prior work on
quantitatively comparing the diﬀerent cost-bene(cid:12)t tradeoﬀs
struck by these architectures in accomplishing this goal.
As a (cid:12)rst step towards addressing this gap, we have de-
veloped a quantitative methodology to empirically evaluate
three puristic approaches that drive the designs of a number
of location-independent network architectures. We combine
this methodology with measured traces of device mobility
and content mobility on the Internet using realistic physical
and routing topologies. Based on measured network mobil-
ity patterns of hundreds of devices of NomadLog, an Android
app we developed explicitly for this goal, and hundreds of
content domains including those delegated to content dis-
tribution networks, we (cid:12)nd that pure name-based routing
induces a prohibitively high update cost at routers because
of device mobility, but induces a far lower update cost in
conjunction with simple forwarding strategies for most of
today’s content that happens to exhibit high locality. Taken
together, our results suggest that recent proposals for name-
based networking in their puristic form are better suited for
content distribution alone, but may need to be augmented
with addressing-assisted approaches like DNS or Mobile IP
in order to handle device mobility, so as to serve as a general-
purpose replacement for the TCP/IP Internet.
