Challenge Return a Value from a Function with Return has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    // Example
    function minusSeven(num) {
      return num - 7;
    }
    // Only change code below this line
    function timesFive(num) {
      return num * 5;
    }
The code above passes the test, but the console output shows the function in
lower case only: `timesfive(5) === 25` instead of `timesFive(5) === 25` like
it should.
