User:  Please briefly introduce the network topology.
Assistant: Network topology refers to the physical or logical connection between nodes in a computer network. Common network topologies include bus, star, ring, tree, and mesh. The bus-type network topology means that all nodes are connected through a common transmission line, and nodes need to communicate through signal broadcasting. The star network topology means that all nodes are connected to a central node, and the central node is responsible for forwarding data, and the communication between nodes needs to be carried out through the central node. The ring network topology means that all nodes are connected in a ring, the input and output of each node are connected to two adjacent nodes, and communication is carried out by transmitting data to adjacent nodes. The tree network topology means that multiple star networks are connected through common nodes, and multiple star networks form a tree structure. The communication between nodes needs to be carried out through the nodes on the tree structure. The mesh network topology refers to the multi-level interconnection between nodes, and the nodes can communicate through multiple paths, which has high reliability and fault tolerance.
