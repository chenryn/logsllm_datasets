Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
core
##### ANSIBLE VERSION

##### CONFIGURATION
Default of yum install
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)  
SUMMARY and
##### SUMMARY
Inconsistent behavior of when statement
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
If I write an inventory file and a task file as follows, `do_something.sh` is
executed only on web1.example.com.
    [webservers]
    web1.example.com var1=true
    web2.example.com var1=false
    - command: /usr/bin/do_something.sh
      when: var1
But if I write an inventory file as follows:
    - command: /usr/bin/do_something.sh
      when: var1 is defined and var1
`do_something.sh` is executed on both web1.example.com and web2.example.com.  
Of course, I know that all host variables defined in inventory files are
treated as string variables. However, it does not explain this inconsistent
behavior.  
Here is an example of task.yml: ansible-2.0-sample/main.yml at master
muziyoshiz/ansible-2.0-sample
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
If `web2.example.com var1=false` is in the inventory file,
  * `when: var1` and `when: var1 is defined and var1` should be treated same as `when: false`
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
If `web2.example.com var1=false` is in the inventory file,
  * `when: var1` was treated same as `when: false`
  * `when: var1 is defined and var1` was treated same as `when: true`
