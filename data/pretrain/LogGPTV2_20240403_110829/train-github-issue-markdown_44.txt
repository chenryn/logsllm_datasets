Long pages such as in regex have many examples but it's difficult to know at a
glance what the documentation contains without scanning the entire document.
Having a table of contents would help a lot with this.
Here is a list of links to different TOC styles from various places for ways
it could be done:
  * Python 2.7 has one in the sidebar. Stays with you as you scroll.
  * Python 3.5 seems to be slightly cleaner but similar. Doesn't stay with you.
  * mozilla javascript docs: is nicely in the sidebar. Follows you down the page (requires the window to be wide enough).
  * wikipedia: in the middle of the page. Doesn't scroll with you.
  * gitbook: stays with you. provides scrolling.
  * perl: looks like it's formatted like a man page.
I looked for some more but didn't find other good examples.
Of these, I like the mozilla, python 2, and gitbook TOCs best with the mozilla
probably the best among them (probably because it's small and clean). However,
I think the gitbook style is probably the most appropriate fit to the std libs
style.
I've also provided a mockups of what a TOC could look like in that style which
is similar to a different thread. Clearly, something would need to be done
with the current sidebar to use this format.
