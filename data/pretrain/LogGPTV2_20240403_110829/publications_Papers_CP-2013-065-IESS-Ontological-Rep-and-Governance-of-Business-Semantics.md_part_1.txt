large number of enterprise systems rely on a large set of functional components

third parties for data and/or functionality exchange and reuse [25]. Indeed elec-
tronic businesses implementations enforce how to carry out a certain business
in a prefixed non-adaptive manner rather than an explicit understanding of the
business (service) domain (read: business (service) semantics) in a way that
could enable a service system to adapt its role in changing value propositions.

does not constitute business service components; they are about functional de-
composition which is very distinct from business service decomposition. Thus
the underlying conception of a service is not merely static: it is largely limited
to request and response elements of software artefacts, which are disjunct from
value creation aspects such as strategy, proposition, roles, resourcing, pricing,
quality and regulatory compliance. This lack of ontological analysis of service
as a first-class concept is also witnessed in business modeling. Only recently a
commonly agreed service conception emerged from a service-dominant market-
ingparadigm.SDLpromotesashiftfromgoodstoserviceasfirst-classcitizenin
economic exchange was required to understand and develop new ways of value
creation in networked enterprises [22]. The immediate ontological consequence
of this was to regard a service as a perdurant (value co-creation activity) rather
than an endurant (value object). This has lead to the design of SDL-compliant
upper-levelmodels(e.g.,[11,26])thatcouldplayanimportantroleinautomated
business service (de)composition.
The importance of services has triggered the idea to use more structured
approaches to design and implement software-based services. For example, the
ISE (Inter-enterprise Service Engineering) [4] methodology and workbench was
one of the first attempts to devise a service engineering procedure for designing
business services. While the approach was orthogonal to the domain for which
services were engineered, ISE can benefit from agreed business semantics that
can support meaningful decision making taking on the aformentioned value co-
creation aspects of services.
In this paper, after an overview of service perspectives in Sect. 2, we set (in

Obviously, this makes only sense if these ontologies are governed effectively, i.e.
they are managed by an optimal configuration of roles among peers in the net-
worked enterprise. The adoption of an upper-ontology can also guarantee that
the services developed follow an SDL paradigm. In Sect. 5, we set the back-
ground for our approach. In Sect. 6, we propose a method for the ontological
representation and governance of business service semantics, and an implemen-
tation in the context of service-oriented Information Governance implemented

2 Service Science, Engineering, and Business Modelling
Maglio et al. [17] define Service Science as “the study of the application of the
resources controlled by one [service] system for the benefit of another [service]
system in the context of an economic exchange”. This study came along with
a shift in marketing from goods-dominant to service-dominant logic (SDL) [32]
where service becomes this new unit of economic exchange. Hence, a service is
conceived as a (value-providing or -integrating) action. This stands in strong
contrasttogoods-dominantlogicinwhichaserviceisconsideredtobeanobject
[11]. This paradigm shift was required to understand and develop new ways of
value creation in networked enterprises [22].

They have been developing largely independently from each other, resulting in
divergent service conceptions.
1. The business perspective – aims to – adopts SDL to understand why en-
terprises should innovate and trade services by considering value creation
aspects. Yet most modelling approaches take the perspective from one com-
pany (e.g., [19,23]). As a consequence, they assume a closed world6 and
their business service semantics, i.e., shared understanding of value aspects,
remains tacit [27]; hence useless outside the organization. Also, these ap-
proaches classify a service as a static resource (i.e., endurant) rather than
as an occurrence of actions (perdurant) in which resources are acted upon
(e.g., [12,33]). Only recently SDL-compliant service meta-models have been
proposed (e.g., [11,26]) that may lead to sound ontological foundations.
2. TheITperspective adoptsservice-orientedmodellingasaparadigmforfunc-
tionaldecompositionandengineeringofdistributedsystems.Prominentser-
vice description meta-models (i.a., WSMO and WSDL) conceive service as
a static function, and fail to convey any value creation aspect. Web service
engineering aims at the interoperability of communication protocols (e.g.,
SOAP,REST)anddataformatsbetweenheterogeneous“serviceparks”(see
[9];andSycarain[31]).Processlanguages(BPMN,BPEL,etc.)areadopted
forchoreography,controlflows,events,andtemporaldependenciestodefine
valid sequences of service invocations. It may be the case that some busi-
nessdecisionlogiciscrypticallyembeddedwithinsomecomplexcontrolflow
logic. In the worse case, the business logic is largely hidden within expert
components or deferred to some manual decision steps.
In the networked Internet era, the ability to reactively (rather than proac-
tively) and automatically (rather than manually) engage in service value chains

is a key competitive advantage. Yet it requires the ability to automate busi-
ness decision making in a way such that computers do not only know a brittle
prefixed operational procedure to carry out business but rather have embedded
business semantics that shall enable them in adapting enterprises operational
activities to maximise the business performance. The governance of business se-
mantics and its embedding in ontologies that support the aformentioned value
creation aspects of service networks entails many requirements that we cannot
cover completely in this paper. Therefore, we focus on quality and compliance
aspects of value interactions. This results in ontological requirements (ORs) (in
Sect. 3) and governance requirements (GRs) (in Sect. 4).
3 Ontological Requirements
To overcome the issue of semantic alignment, peers usually create an ontol-
ogy that is represented using a knowledge representation grammar (textually
using SBVR or OWL , or visual using UML). The more aligned the ontology
with the peer’s individual perspectives, the easier it becomes to synchronize be-
tween business expectations and Web service solutions [5]. OWL-S7 (in 2004)
and WSMO8 (in 2005) were first attempts to standardise operational semantics
for a service, but the ontologies do not capture business semantics necessary to
evaluate quality and compliance aspects of its constituting (action and content)
commitments (Battle in [18]; [24,11]). Hence, our requirements constrain the
foundation (OR1-2) as well as representation (OR3-4) of viable ontologies.
Computational ontologies for our purpose must convey domain-specific busi-
nessservicesemanticsintermsofupper-levelcategoriesandrelationsdescribing
the nature and structure of service-dominant logic. Therefore semantic align-
ment concerns requirements at the upper-level and domain-level, with resp. two
types of validity. First, we require an upper-level foundation that accounts for
service-dominant logic.
Ontological Requirement 1. AnSDL-compliantupper-levelontologyaccounts
for an externally valid alignment of service conceptions such as action, service
system, resource, and service.
Byposingexternal validity,werequirethatanupper-levelontologyshouldserve
eitherasafoundationforthedevelopmentofdomainontologiesorasacommon
ground for aligning heterogenous domain ontologies. The latter requires domain
ontologies to specialize upper-level concepts from SDL for a specific domain of
value creation:
Ontological Requirement 2. A domain-dependent specialisation of an SDL-
valid upper ontology accounts for a descriptively valid alignment of business
service semantics about value creation aspects in a specific domain.

a substantial description of the business service domain as perceived and agreed
by a community. See [1] for more on ontological validity.
The intention of such a domain-dependent specialization is to provide a ser-
vice description,i.e.,adescriptionofvalue-creationaspects,actionsontheseas-
pects,andpeerrolesentitledtorealizetheseactionsinacompliantway.Inthat
respect, our conception lies close to the one proposed by Ferrario and Guarino
[11].Theystatethatservice commitment needstobedistinguishedfromservice
content, i.e., the kind of action(s) the trustee commits to; and service process,
i.e.howtheservicecommitmentisimplemented.Atrusteemakesaservicecom-
mitment to produce a certain content, i.e. set of actions. It is a temporal static
event;aspeechactdocumentedinacontractamongpeers[11].Thiscorresponds
largely to the business service semantics. A service content – while also defin-
ing the types of actions and roles, rather than merely pre-and postconditions
– may well be close to the operational semantics; the latter which definitely
corresponds to the service process. As a result, in order for a service descrip-
tion to make sense for both business and ICT, service commitment speech act
(hence business service semantics) are to be aligned with the service process
(hence operational semantics) through domain-dependent specialisations that
define service content. This ways we could possibly abandon the use of prefixed
process-basedlanguagesandembraceinsteaddeclarativerulesthatcapturewhat
value aspects restrict our decision making, rather than how to actually honour
these restrictions.
The Unified Service Description Language (USDL), and especially Linked-
USDL,isagoodexampleofsuchdomain-specialization.Thelatterusessemantic
Web principles to construct an ontology to describe services by establishing ex-
plicit links to other existing ontologies emerging from Linked Data initiatives.
While the model was initially constructed to describe services, in [3], we con-

Representing this alignment between service commitment and content/process
implies two additional requirements for the ontology representation grammar.
Ontological Requirement 3. Theontologyrepresentationgrammarmustac-
count for tracking of circumstances (e.g., state, event, process) that determine
the relevance of value creation aspects across the service lifecycle.
Indeed, real-world entities, like services, are dynamic by nature [11]. Their pos-
session of (i.e., transient) properties is not always persistent throughout their
lifecycle; hence may change in function of different types of circumstances, in-
