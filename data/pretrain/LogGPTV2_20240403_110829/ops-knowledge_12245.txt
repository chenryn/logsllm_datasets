User: Please tell me the role of virtualization technology and common virtualization technology.
Assistant: The role of virtualization technology: 1. Enhance server utilization: virtualization technology can divide a physical server into multiple virtual servers, thereby improving the utilization of server resources. 2. Improve system availability: virtualization technology can balance the load among virtual servers, so as to avoid the situation where a single failure affects the entire system. 3. Simplified management: Virtualization technology makes server management easier, and various applications can be run on virtual servers isolated from each other, reducing management complexity. 4. Reduce IT costs: Virtualization technology can maximize the use of existing hardware resources, avoiding the increase of new hardware purchase and maintenance costs. Common virtualization technologies: 1. Operating system virtualization technology: multiple operating systems can run simultaneously on a physical machine, such as VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, etc. 2. Application virtualization technology: The application can be packaged into an independent container to separate the application from the system environment, such as Docker. 3. Network virtualization technology: A physical network can be split into multiple virtual networks so that different virtual networks do not interfere with each other, such as Open vSwitch. 4. Storage virtualization technology: It can manage storage resources of different hardware manufacturers and different storage technologies in a unified way to improve storage efficiency, such as SAN, NAS, etc. 5. Database virtualization technology: It can establish a virtual view of data scattered on different physical databases, manage and query data in a unified way, such as Hadoop, Spark, etc.
