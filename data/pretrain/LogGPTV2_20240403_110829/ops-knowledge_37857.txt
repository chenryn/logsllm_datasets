User: does someone have an idea how to get the environment variables on Google-AppEngine ? 
I'm trying to write a simple Script that shall use the Client-IP (for Authentication) and a parameter (geturl or so) from the URL (for e.g. http://thingy.appspot.dom/index?geturl=www.google.at)
I red that i should be able to get the Client-IP via "request.remote_addr" but i seem to lack 'request' even tho i imported webapp from google.appengine.ext
Many thanks in advance,
 Birt
Assistant: To answer the actual question from the title of your post, assuming you're still wondering: to get environment variables, simple import os and the environment is available in os.environ.
