Table 3: Statistics on the afﬁliation networks of the probes detected in the various experimental settings. The values |V1| and |V2|
refer, respectively, to the number of devices and SSIDs extracted from the directed probe requests. The value |E| is the number
of links between the devices and SSIDs. The average number of SSIDs each smartphone is linked to, and the average number of
smartphones announcing an SSID are given in the columns d1 and d2 respectively.

Figure 4: Adamic-Adar similarity: Several networks (e.g., pubs, workplaces) shared by a moderate or large amount of people are
necessary for a relationship between two users to be correctly inferred. On the other hand, a single, private home network used by
just a handful of persons may be enough.
Adar measure discounts the importance of an SSID by a factor that
is logarithmic in the number of the devices that connected to it,
which also well adapts to the heavy-tail distribution of the SSIDs
popularities reported in Figure 3(a).
Among the other possible graph similarity measures found in
the literature [21, 17, 1, 19, 27], those based on the Jaccard Co-
efﬁcient [27] would not work because they do not reduce the im-
portance of popular SSIDs. Measures based on random walks and
nodes distance [27, 19] are instead not directly applicable in our
case as afﬁliation networks are bipartite. Finally, measures based
on textual similarity of SSIDs, determined by applying standard
techniques in information retrieval [29], would not be suited in our
context, as two nodes with exactly the same single (and very com-
mon) SSID would receive the maximum possible similarity score.
4.3.2 Topological properties of the social networks
We studied a number of structural properties of the social net-
works we extracted from our datasets and compared them with
those of commonly studied online social networks [24]. We found
that, consistently in all our datasets, Adamic-Adar with threshold
values close to τ = 0.3 generates social networks with structural
properties that are similar to those of other well-known social net-
works. We therefore discuss the results obtained with this thresh-
old. Note that in our discussion we ignore nodes without edges as
they are irrelevant to our study.
Table 4 reports, for each of our social networks: The number |V|
and |E| of nodes and edges in the network, the average node de-
gree ¯d, the number of connected components NC, the size of the
biggest connected component BCC, the diameter D, and the effec-
tive diameter Deff of the BCC (the 90th percentile of the length of
the shortest paths between nodes of the biggest connected compo-
nent), the triadic closure tc, and the clustering coefﬁcient cc. As we
can observe, although our networks feature a large number of con-
nected components (column NC), the biggest one (column BCC)
always includes between 75.9% and 94.2% of all the nodes. The
length of the longest shortest path (column D) and the 90th per-
centile of the shortest paths lengths (column Deff) of the BCCs of
our networks are close to those of popular online social networks.
For comparison, those computed on a publicly available Facebook
dataset are equal to 8 and 4.7 respectively [30]. We found structural
similarities between our networks and popular online social net-
works also when we measured their density by means of the clus-
tering coefﬁcient (column cc) and the triadic closure [39, 16] (col-
umn tc). These are close to those computed in a publicly available
Twitter dataset, which are 0.56 and 0.06 respectively [30]. Consis-
tently with other social networks, in our networks too the distribu-
tion of the nodes degrees follows a power law [3]. These distribu-
tions are reported in Figure 5 for a group of datasets spanning the
various types of events we targeted: Politics 1, Vatican 1, the Mall,
and the long-term University dataset. Finally, for the same datasets,
we report in Figure 6 the distributions of the connected components
sizes. These show that most of the connected components, exclud-
ing the biggest component, contain between 1 and 10 nodes. The
same property can be found in the other datasets too.
Overall, these results show that the Adamic-Adar metric allows
to bring to light meaningful social structures from all our datasets.
We show experimentally why the same cannot be said about a sim-
ilarity measure based just on the size k of the intersection between

two PNLs. To do so, we use a KNC-Plot, a tool for analysing the
macroscopic properties of the graphs generated from our afﬁlia-
tion networks deﬁned by Kumar et al. [22]. A KNC-Plot provides
a visual indication on how the number of connected components
and the size of the biggest connected component (BCC) change ac-
cording to the minimum number k of common SSIDs required for
an edge to be placed. Figure 7 shows a sample of the KNC-Plots
of the Politics 1, Vatican 1, the Mall and University datasets. Ac-
cording to the ﬁgure, when the threshold k is equal to 1 almost all
the nodes are connected. But increasing just slightly k produces a
steep degradation in the connectivity structure of the graphs. For
instance, with k = 2 the BCCs shrink to around 50% of the nodes,
whereas with k = 3 they shrink to about the 25%. In other words,
the similarity measure based on the size of the intersection of the
PNLs generates an all-or-nothing effect that makes it hard to gain
any insight on the social structure that underlies our datasets. A
similar result was observed in a user-interest graph derived from
Flickr [22].
4.4 Homophily and social inﬂuence in vendor
adoption
Social networks based on WiFi probes may be a useful tool for
studying the effects that physical proximity has on people in our
society.
Indeed, the way we derived our social networks lever-
ages the intuition that users that connect to the same WiFi ac-
cess point are likely to be socially connected to each other—the
higher the Adamic-Adar measure that generates a link, the higher
the chance that two users meet regularly or even live in the same
place. According to a widely studied sociological theory known
as homophily [31], physical proximity should cause interconnected
users to be related in terms of, for instance, interests, social extrac-
tion, age, or gender. Starting from this observation, we evaluate
whether our large scale data collection methodology may be used
to experimentally conﬁrm theories like that of homophily and so-
cial inﬂuence. We do so by measuring the homogeneity in device
vendors adoption in groups of socially interconnected people. In
fact, the choice a user makes of a particular vendor over another
results from a number of factors, such as the user’s wealth or age
or social inﬂuence. We therefore expect people closely related to
each other to tend to use devices of the same vendor.
As a measure of the homogeneity in device vendor adoption be-
tween socially connected users, we use the assortativity [33]. In
our case, the assortativity quantiﬁes the extent to which users of
devices of a given vendor are likely to be connected to each other
rather than with users of devices of different vendors. More for-
mally, given a social network G = (V,E) and a partition C of its
nodes according to their respective vendors, the assortativity of G
is deﬁned as follows:
∑i∈C eii − ∑i∈C c2
