APPENDIX
A. APPENDIX
Proof of Proposition 1
PROOF. The starting point is Palm inversion formula [1], which
relates time average to event average with respect to some point
process. In our setting it reads as:
(cid:17)
E[X(0)] =
E0
T
[
S0
0 X(s)ds]
E0
T
[S0]
.
(16)
We can think of (16) as the ratio of the expected number of packets
sent in-between two successive loss events and the expected loss
event inter-arrival time. However, it is important to remember the
expected values are with respect to the Palm probability that is as
seen at the loss event instants.
For the basic control this gives
E[X(0)] =
E0
T
E0
T
[X0S0]
[S0]
.
(17)
By (3), θn = XnSn, Xn = f (1/ˆθn), and Sn = θn
bining the last three identities into (17) we obtain (8).
f (1/ ˆθn) . Com-
Proof of Proposition 2
PROOF. Note that if ˆθn+1 ≤ ˆθn, then the comprehensive con-
trol in Equation (9) behaves the same way as the basic control (3).
In this case θn = XnSn, and thus Sn = θn
f (1/ ˆθn) . Next, we con-
sider the other case, i.e. ˆθn+1 > ˆθn.

Finally, if f (1/x) is strictly convex with x, that is (F2c) holds, and
(V) holds, then the right-hand side in the above inequality is strictly
positive, and thus (C1) does not hold.
An Intermediate Property between Theorem 1
and Theorem 2
The following theorem is intermediate between Theorem 1 and
Theorem 2.
THEOREM 3. If (F1) and
] ≥ 0,
(C3) cov0
the basic control is conservative.
T[X0S0, 1
X0
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2 and is not given here.
If the convexity condition (F1) is almost true, then the same as in
Proposition 3 holds.
This theorem is intermediate between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.
Indeed (F 2) ⇒ (F 1) and (C3) ⇒ (C2). The former is straight-
forward; a proof of the latter implication uses the convexity of 1/x.
Thus Theorem 3 is with a weaker condition on the function f than
Theorem 2, but this comes at the expense of having a stronger con-
dition on the statistics of (θn)n. A natural question is whether both
Theorem 3 and the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2 derive from a more gen-
eral theorem, which would state that under the combination of the
less restrictive conditions (F1) and (C2), the control would be con-
servative. But this is not true; a counter-example is the case pre-
sented in the second paragraph of the interpretation of Theorem 2.
Proof of Proposition 3
PROOF. Use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 1. By
Equation (8) the ratio of throughput to f (¯p) is equal to
(cid:19)
ρ := mg(m)
θ0g(ˆθ0)
E0
T
(cid:20) .
Now we have
g
∗∗(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ rg
The same argument as in the proof of Theorem 1, applied to g
instead of g, shows that and thus ρ ≤ r.
Proof of Theorem 2
∗∗(x).
PROOF. Use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 1.
Part 1. By (C2)
(cid:19)

(cid:20) ,
E0
T
1
g( ˆθ0)
T [θ0g(ˆθ0)] ≥
E0

(cid:21)
now (F2) means that 1
g is concave, thus by Jensen’s inequality:
E0
T
1
g(ˆθ0)
≤
1
[ˆθ0])
g(E0
T
,
(22)
which combined with the previous equation shows that the control
is conservative.
Part 2. By (C2c) and (F2c) we have the reverse inequalities
in Equation (21) and Equation (22), but the inequality is strict in
Equation (22) because convexity is strict and ˆθn is not a degenerate
random variable.
Derivation of Equation (14)
PROOF. We start from Equation (1). By Neveu’s exchange for-
mula ([1], Sec. 3.3.4) and simple conditioning

We show that the above is equivalent to Equation (14).
As an application of Palm inversion formula to X(0)1Z(0)=i, we
obtain
¯xi = E[X(0)|Z(0) = i] =

Finally, by plugging the above expressions for ¯xi, πi, and ¯pi into
Equation (14) we recover Equation (23).
