User: I am trying to wrap my head around Python, while my brain works for Java and Scala, so please excuse if this question is ill-formulated.
I have managed to setup NetBeans 6.9 with Python 2.7 on OS X. I can compile and run my project, fine.
Now what I want is something equivalent to sbt's console command. I want to launch the Python REPL with my project on the classpath, so that basically I can interactively call into my custom functions and classes.
There is Window -> PythonConsole, but that launches some Python (or Jython?) 2.5 instead, and my modules don't seem to be in the namespace.
Assistant: I had a similar problem.
Go tools->python platforms and set the default platform to python 2.7. This should cause window->pythonConsole to launch the correct version of python.
As for then being able to import your custom modules... that's the problem I'm currently having too.
