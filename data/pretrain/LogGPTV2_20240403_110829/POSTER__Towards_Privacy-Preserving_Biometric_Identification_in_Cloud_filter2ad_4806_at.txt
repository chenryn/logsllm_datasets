The overall execution time of the protocol for multimodal user authentication
is less than a second. Note that the number and/or the size of the templates
might diﬀer depending on the application.
7 Discussion
The use of cloud technologies for providing biometric services requires biometric
data outsourcing, which implies security and privacy risks for the users’
information. However, due to the increased fraud occurrences and malicious
attacks, BaaS has been a competitive arena for more advanced and complex
cryptographic techniques to ensure security of the private data. Our multimodal
AaaS architecture leverages the large-scale computing resources in the cloud
while it oﬀers ﬂexibility, mobility, scalability, and cost reduction in terms of data
storage and processing power to enhance the performance of user recognition.
The system can securely share data with remote UAs with biometric DBs over
140

the network while MPC techniques make the stored templates, matching and
fusion scores inaccessible to all parties. There is no biometric data disclosure
towards the MIP and consequently the UAs that can only learn the fact that a
query for a given user was made, and they do not gain access to the result of
computation.
Furthermore, our approach implements multimodal biometrics providing better
identiﬁcation reliability, which is a common requirement for high security
services [122]. Using the multimodal AaaS system, the SP acquires recognition
capabilities without additional costs for the infrastructure to deal with the
feature extraction, matching, fusion and decision modules. In that way, the
SP conﬁrms identities via a network connection to the cloud-based MIP and
subsequently to the UAs while it avoids to handle time and cost consuming
enrollment procedures, invest in necessary storage capacity and worry about the
legal requirements regarding the security of sensitive information in a CBDB.
This signiﬁcantly reduces startup, running and policy costs for both the MIPs
and SPs. As a result of being able to quickly search, compare and accurately
fuse, the MIP can help the SP to combat fraud and to oﬀer an improved
user-service interface. Additionally, since IdMaaS enables the developers of
authentication technology to set their statistical and mathematical methods
to match biometrics in the cloud, the UAs can securely provision and release
the shared resources with minimal MIP interaction and management eﬀort.
Finally, our approach guarantees to the users that the rendered services are only
accessible to authorized parties. Thus, instead of being enrolled and presenting
the same biometric traits across diﬀerent remote providers, he can trust the
storage and processing of his biometrics in an AaaS scheme that applies the
necessary controls and is consistent with legal requirements for privacy and
security by design. Hence, we assess that our proposed solution for identity
management can oﬀer a cost-eﬀective, ﬂexible business model for unimodal,
bimodal or multimodal user authentication. It presents greater accountability
with biometric logins because it connects an individual to a particular action
and it is ready to deploy in realistic scenarios that ﬁt to the government and
ﬁnancial sectors for access control applications where user higher authentication
precision and security without compromising privacy are important [91,183].
Although, the system has been designed for authentication purposes, it can
also operate for identiﬁcation with slight diﬀerences, without requesting and
transmitting user credentials to the cloud. One foreseen application could be
a lawful surveillance oriented scheme for government services, operating to
automatically screen and match the crowd (facial and gait recognition) in
order to identify missing persons. However, computation time would drastically
increase for identiﬁcation use cases. The size of the unimodal repositories has
an impact on the overall procedure and our architecture may be proven an

unpractical approach for large-scale biometric DBs. Furthermore, regarding
fusion, the ﬁnal fused matching score is computed from stored unimodal
templates originated from disparate sensors of the UAs. Thus, interoperability
issues may reduce the multimodal authentication performance and consequently
our system’s accuracy and robustness. Finally, we assess that a clear limitation
is the requirements and restrictions put in place by our research methodology.
We selected three uncorrelated modalities to perform the matching procedure
working with Hamming Distance algorithms and a user-speciﬁc weighted score
level fusion with an applicable sum rule. Although the authentication protocol
is ﬂexible and can easily permit diﬀerent unimodal biometrics, matching and
fusion techniques, the use of more complex metrics and processes may aﬀect
the complexity and eﬃciency due to a higher cost for biometrics extraction and
user multimodal recognition.
8 Conclusion and Future Work
Nowadays, the amount of biometric data for authentication purposes is increasing
rapidly, while it requires large processing and storage capacity. Cloud computing
is an innovative infrastructure allowing SPs to manage these challenges eﬃciently
and oﬀer improved AaaS technologies. In this work, we presented a distributed
approach for secure and privacy-preserving multimodal AaaS in a domain with
mutually distrustful parties. To avoid an auxiliary temporary or permanent
CBDB, we exploited already stored unimodal templates held by distinct
UAs, being used in AaaS designs based on single modalities. To obtain a
multimodal fused result, we utilized Hamming Distance algorithms and a
user-speciﬁc weighted score level fusion method. Finally, MPC techniques are
used in order to build our protocol that obtains security and privacy in a
decentralized manner without information disclosure in order to maintain the
conﬁdentiality and integrity of users’ data. The stored biometric information,
the data transmission, the authentication calculations and the ﬁnal output are
protected from the untrusted cloud parties. In this way, the proposed system
leverages the advantages of multimodal biometrics and the eﬃciency of the
underlying primitives with computation and communication overhead.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst one to propose a privacy-
by-design approach for multimodal biometric authentication using cloud-based
providers. Our system performs authentication including several biometric
features (in our studied scenario have been selected three) while avoiding a
new enrollment process for the users and without requesting any additional
storage of private data. It oﬀers a convenient solution for precision and reliability
while restricting misuses of sensitive information, characterized by dynamic
functionality and ﬂexibility in terms of computation and communication

eﬃciency. Moreover, the protocol may be easily extended to update the
parameters and adjust diﬀerent biometrics, classiﬁers, matching methods and
fusion rules. Through the prism of the new European GDPR [66] and the
European Regulatory Technical Standards for Strong Customer Authentication
RTS-SCA [183], biometric markets are forced to revise their infrastructure,
taking into account the privacy rights of their users in order to be beneﬁt from
utility of the cloud. Thus, our architecture can serve as a framework for future
applications, platforms and systems in which existing biometric datasets need
to be leveraged.
We identiﬁed ﬁve directions for future work on multimodal authentication
as BaaS using cloud-based IdMaaS and AaaS providers. First, the system’s
eﬀectiveness depends on the weighted score level fusion model, where weights
are products of the training procedures that are followed by the UAs subsystems.
Although this is a time-consuming process and the available for research
biometric data sources are limited, it should be explored how the combination
of a variety of thresholds over the range of performance rates aﬀects the overall
accuracy and the usability of the user-speciﬁc fusion methods. Second, in the
context of the MPC, to preserve conﬁdentiality, unobservability and unlinkability,
the query patterns can be statistically anonymized in order to hide the user’s
identity and real authentication queries count from the remote UAs. This
would require protocol changes, where trade-oﬀs between security and eﬃciency
should be assessed. Third, the size of the templates’ repositories of the UAs
should be taken into account for any extension of the protocol to perform
in identiﬁcation mode, evaluating the practicality of the system in terms of
computation and communication, complexity. Fourth, regarding the privacy and
security frameworks, there are legal regulations that allow the migration of users’
biometric data to a web interface. However, they prevent personal information
transfers outside the organizations’ national operating framework [183]. This fact
may limit the ﬂexibility of the UAs that may not comply with the same privacy
regulations and constraints, and consequently the scalability of multimodal
AaaS. Fifth and last, a critical aspect for AaaS is to integrate an anti-spooﬁng
module, such as a challenge-response user interaction approach for liveness
detection, to test stability and resistance against sophisticated fraud attacks.
