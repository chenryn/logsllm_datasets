### 5.1 Memory Errors and Continued Execution

Boundless memory blocks allow a program to continue executing even in the presence of memory errors. We have also developed a technique called "failure-oblivious computing," which discards out-of-bounds writes and manufactures values for out-of-bounds reads [36]. Although this technique can lead the program down an unanticipated execution path, it enables servers to execute through memory errors (such as buffer overflows) and continue serving subsequent requests. Another approach involves terminating the enclosing function and continuing with the code immediately following the corresponding function call [40]. Results indicate that, in many cases, the program can continue to execute acceptably after the premature function termination. These techniques differ from boundless memory blocks in that they are designed to convert incorrect and dangerous execution paths into unanticipated but acceptable ones, whereas boundless memory blocks aim to convert incorrect execution paths into correct and anticipated ones.

### 5.2 Safe-C Compilers

Our work builds on previous research into implementing memory-safe versions of C [15, 43, 34, 27, 38, 28]. As described in Section 3, our implementation uses techniques originally developed by Jones and Kelly [28], and significantly refined by Ruwase and Lam [38]. Memory-safe C compilers use various methods to detect out-of-bounds memory accesses via pointers, all of which modify the pointer representation compared to standard C compilers. To implement boundless memory blocks, it is essential that the pointer representation preserves the memory block and offset information for out-of-bounds pointers.

It is also feasible to implement boundless memory blocks for safe languages like Java or ML by replacing the generated code that throws exceptions in response to out-of-bounds accesses. The new generated code would store out-of-bounds writes in a hash table and appropriately retrieve stored values for out-of-bounds reads.

### 5.3 Traditional Error Recovery

The traditional error recovery mechanism is to reboot the system, applying necessary repairs during the reboot to bring the system back up successfully [23]. Techniques such as fast reboots [39], checkpointing [30, 31], and partial system restarts [17] can improve the performance of the reboot process. Hardware redundancy is the standard solution for increased availability.

Boundless memory blocks differ in that they are designed to convert erroneous executions into correct ones. The advantages include better availability due to the elimination of downtime and vulnerabilities to persistent errors. For example, restarting Pine as described in Section 4.3 does not enable the user to read mail if the mail file still contains a problematic message.

### 5.4 Manual Error Detection and Recovery

Motivated partly by the need to avoid rebooting, researchers have developed more fine-grained error recovery mechanisms. The Lucent 5ESS switch and the IBM MVS operating system, for instance, both contain software components that detect and attempt to repair inconsistent data structures [26, 33, 24]. Other techniques include failure recovery blocks and exception handlers, which may contain hand-coded recovery algorithms [32].

The successful application of these techniques requires the programmer to anticipate some aspects of the error and develop an appropriate recovery strategy based on this understanding. In contrast, boundless memory blocks can be applied without programmer intervention to any system, completely eliminating memory block size calculation errors.

Data structure repair [20] occupies a middle ground. Like more traditional error detection and recovery techniques, it requires the programmer to provide some application-specific information (e.g., a data structure consistency specification). However, because there is no explicit recovery procedure and the consistency specification is not tied to specific blocks of code, data structure repair may enable systems to more effectively recover from unanticipated data structure corruption errors.

### 5.5 Static Analysis and Program Annotations

Another approach to addressing memory errors is through a combination of static analysis and program annotations, which should, in principle, enable programmers to deliver programs free of memory errors [22, 21, 42, 37]. These techniques share the advantage of providing a static guarantee that the program will not exhibit a specific kind of memory error, but they also have drawbacks, such as the need for programmer annotations or the possibility of conservatively rejecting safe programs. Even if the analysis cannot verify that the entire program is free of memory errors, it may be able to statically recognize some accesses that will never cause a memory error, remove dynamic checks for those accesses, and thereby reduce dynamic checking overhead.

Researchers have also developed unsound, incomplete analyses that heuristically identify potential errors [41, 16]. The advantage is that such approaches typically require no annotations and scale better to larger programs; the disadvantage is that they may miss some genuine memory errors because they are unsound.

### 5.6 Buffer Overflow Detection Tools

Researchers have developed techniques designed to detect buffer overflow attacks after they occur and halt the execution of the program before the attack can take effect. StackGuard [19] and StackShield [14] modify the compiler to generate code that detects attacks that overwrite the return address on the stack; StackShield also performs range checks to detect overwritten function pointers.

It is also possible to apply buffer overflow detection directly to binaries. Purify instruments the binary to detect a range of memory errors, including out-of-bounds memory accesses [25]. Program shepherding uses an efficient binary interpreter to prevent an attacker from executing injected code [29].

A key difference between these techniques and boundless memory blocks is that boundless memory blocks prevent the attack from performing out-of-bounds writes that corrupt the address space. These writes are instead redirected into a hash table that holds the out-of-bounds writes. Our implementation of boundless memory blocks also generates a log file that identifies all out-of-bounds accesses, enabling the programmer to update the code to eliminate such accesses if desired.

### 5.7 Extensible Arrays

Many languages provide extensible array data structures, which dynamically grow to accommodate elements stored at arbitrary offsets. Boundless memory blocks, in effect, are an implementation of extensible arrays. They differ from standard extensible arrays in their tight integration with the C programming language, especially in preserving the address space from the original legacy implementation. This integration forces the compiler to make large-scale changes to the generated code to perform the required checks and integrate effectively with low-level packages that maintain information about out-of-bounds pointers and accesses.

### 6. Conclusion

Memory errors are a significant source of program failures and security vulnerabilities. This paper demonstrates how to automatically convert legacy C programs to use (conceptually) boundless memory blocks. This conversion eliminates memory errors associated with out-of-bounds reads and writes and, as our results indicate, makes the program invulnerable to buffer overflow attacks that exploit these errors. The measured overhead of applying our technique is acceptable for widely used open-source server programs that we tested.
