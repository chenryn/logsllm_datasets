### Respective Traffic Composition and Protocol Complexity in ICS Networks

In our analysis, 21.4% of the total traffic is attributed to 'Java RMI' (Figure 2a). Additionally, we observed known Internet protocols such as HTTPS between servers and SMB for file servers.

**Key Insight:**
Contrary to previous studies suggesting that ICS networks typically use a single protocol, our findings indicate that ICS networks can feature a diverse mix of multiple protocols. This complexity, particularly at higher layers, makes ICS networks more comparable to typical LANs rather than single-protocol networks.

### Impact of Bugs on Traffic Composition

We noted an unexpectedly high volume of UDP-based traffic, ranging from 68% to 75%, across all levels in the trace. To understand this anomaly, we evaluated the application mix and found that SNMP was responsible for the high share of UDP traffic. Upon consultation with the power plant operator, it was determined that this is due to a bug in the control system, which unnecessarily pulls status information from network devices. While this bug does not affect the plant's operation, it disrupts network monitoring. In contrast to frequently updated Internet applications, power plant infrastructure is generally static and can only be updated during specific maintenance windows. Thus, changes in traffic composition can impact network dimensioning and should be considered in network planning simulations.

### Encryption in ICS Networks

Our observations indicate minimal encrypted traffic. The only encrypted traffic, accounting for 12.8% of the total, was seen on port 443 (HTTPS) between two pairs of servers in the supervisory level of Power Plant 1. This finding aligns with similar observations in other industrial settings [4,13].

### Application Mix Differences Across Power Plants

#### Comparing Different Vendors
To determine if the application mix is consistent across different power plants, we compared the application mix for plants with different control systems. For instance, Power Plant 1 uses a different vendor's control system compared to Power Plants 2 and 3. The network architecture in these plants differs, with the supervisory and control levels merged. The operators of these plants enabled traffic captures at a single vantage point. 

- **Power Plant 1:** At the supervisory level, Java RMI traffic predominates over ports 50000, 50001, etc. At the control level, three proprietary ICS protocols communicate over many ports, representing the largest share of communication.
- **Power Plants 2 and 3:** These plants show fewer actively used ports, with (ICS) application protocols consistently using the same port number. Remote procedure call realizations are also present. The port-based application mix varies significantly between power plants running different control systems, reflecting the vendor-specific design of control systems.

#### Same Vendor Control Systems
We compared Power Plants 2 and 3, both using the same vendor's control system. Both plants show a significant share of proprietary TCP-based traffic on port 2010, with 65% and 29% respectively. We label this protocol as ICS 3. The largest share at Plant 3 is on port 2000 (labeled ICS 4). After consulting the operator of Plant 2, we found that ICS 4 is also in use but not visible at this vantage point. Additionally, 9% X11 traffic was observed in Plant 3, likely due to remote maintenance sessions. Despite these similarities, other port-level statistics differ, indicating that power plants using the same vendor's control system have partially comparable application mixes.

### Understanding Proprietary ICS Protocols

The ICS protocols used in the studied power plants are proprietary and undocumented. Our analysis in Section 4 relied on manual payload inspection. We now explore whether these protocols can be identified statistically without prior knowledge.

#### Clustering Communication by Packet Payload Differences
ICS protocols often consist of few message types and physical values within a well-defined range, leading to recurring values in the payload. We used the Levenshtein ratio to measure payload similarity. Our analysis revealed that TCP port ranges 1487 to 3137 and 42239 to 44061 (labeled ICS 1) and UDP ports 10002 and 10003 (labeled SPPA) have highly similar payloads. This method successfully identified all used protocols, confirming our manual inspection.

#### Metadata Clustering
In public traces, payload data is often unavailable. We explored whether metadata such as packet inter-arrival times and header information could identify protocols. Using DBSCAN and k-means clustering, we found that while both methods successfully distinguished different protocols, the results were less accurate compared to payload-based identification.

### Measuring at a Power Plant Training Facility

Traffic capture in operational power plants is limited to rare maintenance windows. Therefore, we studied a training facility that replicates the automation network of Power Plant 1. This facility lacks the physical production layer, which is simulated by software.

- **Supervisory Level:** No RPC-based communication; instead, other TCP-based traffic at 10 different ports, each with about 10% share.
- **Control Level:** Major traffic on port 8888, with some proprietary traffic and SSH communication.
- **Field Level:** Exclusively COTP traffic.

The application mix in the training facility is substantially different from the real-world network, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on simulation facilities for understanding ICS networks.

### Conclusion

Access to DCS networks in critical infrastructures is highly restricted, limiting public knowledge about their properties. Our study provides an empirical perspective on these networks, showing that DCS networks in power plants feature a rich and varied protocol mix. We demonstrated that proprietary ICS protocols can be identified using statistical clustering, even in the absence of payload data. Finally, we found that training facilities do not accurately reflect the traffic of real-world ICS networks, emphasizing the need for direct measurements in operational environments.
