VI. EVALUATION
In this section, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness
of signal cancellation under different number of veriﬁers. We
also discuss practical implementation details.
Experimental Setup: We performed all the experiments
using NI-USRP 2921 devices. Each device and the hub was
realized by one USRP device. The adversary was implemented
using two USRP devices one for listening and one for relaying.
The listening adversarial device was equipped with a directional
antenna (LP0965 Log Periodic PCB Antenna, 850MHz to
6.5GHz) aimed at the TX, whereas the adversarial transmit-
ting device was equipped with either a directional antenna
aiming at one RX, or an omnidirectional antenna targeting
multiple RXs. All devices were synchronized (with the clock
of the same computer) and transmitted at 2.4GHz with 22MHz
bandwidth. The slot duration was ﬁxed to 1ms. An ON slot
was realized with the transmission of 250 random symbols
with 4μs duration, whereas an OFF slot was realized with
silence. Experiments were performed at night to minimize Wi-
Fi interference although Wi-Fi beacon signals were present
during the experiments. The threshold for determining an ON
slot was set to -50dBm, which is signiﬁcantly higher than
the receiver sensitivity (typically at or less than -70dBm).
This higher value was selected to minimize false positives
due to ambient wireless activities at the 2.4GHz band. Each
experiment was repeated 106 times.
A. Effectiveness of the Signal Cancellation
Signal cancellation when n = 1, 2. In the ﬁrst set of
experiments, we evaluated the probability pn (used in Propo-
sition 2 and Corollary 1) of successful signal cancellation via
a relay attack for n = 1 and n = 2. For n = 1, we used
the experimental setup shown in Fig. 17(a). A device D1 sent
106 MC ON-OFF modulated bits to a hub A in the presence
of M who performed a relay cancellation. The two USRPs
implementing M were stacked on top of each other at a location
on one ellipse that satisﬁed (3) and (4). For n = 2, we used
the experimental setup shown in Fig. 17(b). The adversary was
placed at the intersection of the two ellipses that satisﬁed (3)
and (4). The transmitting antenna of M was replaced with an
omnidirectional one to allow the simultaneous cancellation at
two locations.
The receiver at M played three roles: (a) estimate the
respective channels, (b) quickly detect ON slots using energy
detection, and (c) determine the symbols being transmitted from
D1 during ON slots in an online fashion as M is not aware of
the pseudo-random symbols transmitted by D1. The estimated
channel was used to craft the amplitude of the symbol relayed
by M’s transmitter to cancel D1’s signal at the receivers (the
phase was matched based on M’s location). The transmitting
signal at M was crafted using two approaches. In the ﬁrst
approach, M estimated the hD1M and hM A channels based
on the transmissions of D1 and A, respectively. The hD1A
channel was modeled after a Rician model with a K factor
equal to two, which represents an indoor environment with a
strong LoS component. In the second approach, no channel
estimation took place at M. All channels were modeled after a
free-space path loss model with an attenuation exponent α = 2.
Figure 17(c) shows the cancellation probability (p) as a
function of the difference between the direct and relay paths.
The adversary was placed at the different ellipses dictated by
eq. (4), and for w =1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We observe that
when the adversary is close and therefore, has a dominant
LoS channel to D1 and H, the cancellation probability is quite
high (94.56% and 91.17% for estimated channel and modeled
channel attenuation, respectively for n = 1 and 90.57% and
84.42% for estimated channel and modeled channel attenu-
ation, respectively for n = 2). Even at several wavelengths
away, signal cancellation remains possible with non-negligible
probability. The cancellation performance is worse for n = 2
because M has to perform simultaneous cancellation at both
A and D2 and more channels need to be estimated. Moreover,
the channel estimation yields a stronger cancellation capability
compared to channel modeling for both n = 1 and n = 2.
Sensitivity to location placement: In the next set of ex-
periments, we studied the sensitivity of the cancellation attack
to M’s location. The adversary was placed at a set of ellipses
with a path difference between λ to 2λ and incremented by a
step of λ/8. Figure 17(d) shows the cancellation probability as
a function of the difference between the direct and relay path.
As expected, the cancellation probability is maximized when
the path difference equals (3λ/2), which satisﬁes eq. (4). The
cancellation probability drops signiﬁcantly when M’s location
deviates more than λ/2 from the optimal location for both
n = 1 and n = 2. From this experiment, we verify that signal
cancellation attacks are sensitive to the adversary’s location due
to the short wavelength of the carrier frequency. A location
perturbation of just a few centimeters is sufﬁcient to reduce
the effectiveness of the attack, as M’s signal no longer arrives
at the targeted RXs with the opposite phase.
Signal cancellation when n = 3: We also evaluated the
signal cancellation capability for the one TX/three RX scenario
and the three TX/one RX scenario. These two cases serve as
the basis for the security of VERSE. We used the topology
shown in Fig. 18(a). In the ﬁrst scenario, D1 broadcasted MC
ON-OFF signals that were simultaneously received by three
RXs. According to Proposition 1, there is no single location
that allows M perform signal cancellation to all three RXs.
Therefore, we selected a set of locations that could likely
succeed in canceling some of the received signals. Speciﬁcally,
the adversary is placed in all locations marked by dots. Loca-
tions (A, B, C, E, F, H) correspond to the intersection of two
ellipses whereas locations (D, G, I) are the centroids of the

areas created by the three closest intersection points. In the
second scenario, A, D2, and D3 synchronously transmitted an
MC ON-OFF signal that was received by D1.
Figure 18(b) shows the cancellation probability for the two
different scenarios and for each location. We observe that
for any scenario, the cancellation probability is below 10−4.
Moreover, the cancellation probability was non-zero in all cases
due to the relatively high threshold value (-50dBm) that was
used to detect ON slots. Although the adversary’s signal was
not the exact inverse to annihilate legitimate transmissions,
on certain occasions, there was sufﬁcient alignment to drop
the received power below -50dBm for the respective RX(s). It
should be noted here that this experiment is not the proof of the
adversary’s inability in performing cancellation when n >2,
but the proof is derived from Proposition 1.
Alarm raising probability: We further evaluated the secu-
rity of VERSE in terms of raising an alarm. We replicated the
experimental setup of Fig. 18 and implemented the veriﬁcation
phase where every device transmits the hash of the protocol
transcript using MC ON-OFF modulation. We considered an
(cid:2)
adversary that successfully replaced m1 of D1 with m
1 leading
to the compilation of sM at D2, D3, A and the compilation of
s at D1. To account for a varying number of bits that must
be canceled by M, we varied the Hamming distance between
h(sM ) and h(s) from 0.1 of the hash length (160 bits) to 0.8
of the hash length. This is done by randomly generating two
160-bit strings with the desired Hamming distances. An alarm
was raised by any device that detected a transmitted sequence
different
than the one it was transmitting. In all scenarios
tested and for all adversary locations, all veriﬁers detected
the message manipulation and raised an alarm. The attack was
detected with probability one for all 106 hash transmissions.

B. Practical Considerations
We now analyze the time synchronization requirement, inter-
ference effect for the VERSE protocol and its timing overhead.
Synchronization: During the veriﬁcation phase of VERSE,
multiple devices must simultaneously transmit an ON-OFF
sequence. Possible misalignment between the clocks of each
device may lead to false alarms. To address the possible time
misalignment, the hub broadcasts a delimiter just before the
start of the veriﬁcation phase, to synchronize The clock of
each device. Despite this synchronization, there is still possible
time misalignment between the devices due to clock drift
and the different path delays caused by multipath or NLoS
channels to each receiver. There have been extensive studies
on synchronization of independent wireless nodes [33], but
practically it is impossible to reach perfect synchronization.
Figure 19 shows an example, where D1, D2, and D3 transmit
simultaneously, with the transmissions being misaligned by a
time offset . Misalignment causes some energy from ON slots
“bleed” into OFF slots and some silent period of the OFF slot
“bleed” into ON slots. However, the offset  is much smaller
(a few μsec) than the slot duration for the ON-OFF sequence
which is set to 1ms. The state s(j) of the jth slot is decided
according to the following rule:
OFF,
