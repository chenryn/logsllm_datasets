User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Am I being attacked? I saw this in the error log in the cPanel and I think someone is accessing my files.

I am newbie, please help me.

Assistant: You're probably fine, this was likely an automated scan searching for WordPress installations across the Internet. If that's the only log entry, I'd ignore it.
