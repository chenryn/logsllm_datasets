I'm having trouble with .AppleDouble directories, which are picked up when I
run commands from the command line. Symfony expects the wrong classes in the
files "inside" the .AppeDouble directories. Of course Symfony2 should just
ignore the .AppleDouble directory as there is only metadata in there.
These issue already came up in #994 and apparently was fixed in `7ab3fde`.
This does not work for me however. I think the problem is that .AppleDouble is
a directory, not a file. If I add .AppleDouble to the VCS patterns, it works
and no files "inside" .AppleDouble are picked up.
Of course, this does not seem to be the "right" way of doing this. My thinking
would be to rename $vcsPatterns to $directoryPatterns. If that sounds good,
I'm happy to make a pull request.
