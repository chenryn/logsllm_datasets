Abstract
Advanced imaging technologies are a new class of peo-
ple screening systems used at airports and other sensitive
environments to detect metallic as well as nonmetallic
contraband. We present the ﬁrst independent security
evaluation of such a system, the Rapiscan Secure 1000
full-body scanner, which was widely deployed at airport
checkpoints in the U.S. from 2009 until 2013. We ﬁnd
that the system provides weak protection against adaptive
adversaries: It is possible to conceal knives, guns, and
explosives from detection by exploiting properties of the
device’s backscatter X-ray technology. We also investi-
gate cyberphysical threats and propose novel attacks that
use malicious software and hardware to compromise the
the effectiveness, safety, and privacy of the device. Over-
all, our ﬁndings paint a mixed picture of the Secure 1000
that carries lessons for the design, evaluation, and opera-
tion of advanced imaging technologies, for the ongoing
public debate concerning their use, and for cyberphysical
security more broadly.

Introduction
In response to evolving terrorist threats, including non-
metallic explosive devices and weapons, the U.S. Trans-
portation Security Administration (TSA) has adopted ad-
vanced imaging technology (AIT), also known as whole-
body imaging, as the primary passenger screening method
at nearly 160 airports nationwide [50]. Introduced in 2009
and gradually deployed at a cost exceeding $1 billion, AIT
provides, according to the TSA, “the best opportunity to
detect metallic and non-metallic anomalies concealed un-
der clothing without the need to touch the passenger” [48].
AIT plays a critical role in transportation security, and
decisions about its use are a matter of public interest.
The technology has generated considerable controversy,
including claims that the devices are unsafe [40], vio-
late privacy and civil liberties [27, 41], and are ineffec-
tive [8, 21]. Furthermore, AIT devices are complex cyber-
physical systems — much like cars [23] and implantable
medical devices [13] — that raise novel computer security
issues. Despite such concerns, neither the manufacturers
nor the government agencies that deploy these machines
have disclosed sufﬁcient technical details to facilitate rig-
orous independent evaluation [40], on the grounds that
such information could beneﬁt attackers [48]. This lack

of transparency has limited the ability of policymakers,
experts, and the public to assess contradicting claims.
To help advance the public debate, we present the ﬁrst
experimental analysis of an AIT conducted independently
of the manufacturer and its customers. We obtained a
Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner — one of two
AITs widely deployed by the TSA [32] — and performed
a detailed security evaluation of its hardware and software.
Our analysis provides both retrospective insights into the
adequacy of the testing and evaluation procedures that
led up to TSA use of the system, and prospective lessons
about broader security concerns, including cyberphysical
threats, that apply to both current and future AITs.
The Secure 1000 provides a unique opportunity to in-
vestigate the security implications of AITs in a manner
that allows robust yet responsible public disclosure. Al-
though it was used by the TSA from 2009 until 2013,
it has recently been removed from U.S. airports due to
changing functional requirements [34]. Moreover, while
the Secure 1000 uses backscatter X-ray imaging, current
TSA systems are based on a different technology, mil-

limeter waves [11], so many of the attacks we present
are not directly applicable to current TSA checkpoints,
thus reducing the risk that our technical disclosures will
inadvertently facilitate mass terrorism. However, while
Secure 1000 units are no longer used in airports, they still
are in use at other government facilities, such as court-
houses and prisons (see, e.g., [15, 29]). In addition, other
backscatter X-ray devices manufactured by American Sci-
ence and Engineering are currently under consideration
for use at airports [34]. To mitigate any residual risk, we
have redacted a small number of sensitive details from
our attacks in order to avoid providing recipes that would
allow an attacker to reliably defeat the screening process
without having access to a machine for testing.
In the ﬁrst part of our study (Section 3), we test the
Secure 1000’s effectiveness as a physical security system
by experimenting with different methods of concealing
contraband. While the device performs well against naïve
adversaries, fundamental limitations of backscatter imag-
ing allow more clever attackers to defeat it. We show
that an adaptive adversary, with the ability to reﬁne his
techniques based on experiment, can conﬁdently smuggle
contraband past the scanner by carefully arranging it on
his body, obscuring it with other materials, or properly
shaping it. Using these techniques, we are able to hide
ﬁrearms, knives, plastic explosive simulants, and detona-
tors in our tests. These attacks are surprisingly robust, and
they suggest a failure on the part of the Secure 1000’s de-
signers and the TSA to adequately anticipate adaptive at-
tackers. Fortunately, there are simple procedural changes
that can reduce (though not eliminate) these threats, such
as performing supplemental scans from the sides or addi-
tional screening with a magnetometer.
Next, we evaluate the security of the Secure 1000 as
a cyberphysical system (Section 4) and experiment with
three novel kinds of attacks against AITs that target their
effectiveness, safety features, and privacy protections. We
demonstrate how malware infecting the operator’s con-
sole could selectively render contraband invisible upon
receiving a “secret knock” from the attacker. We also at-
tempt (with limited success) to use software-based attacks
to bypass the scanner’s safety interlocks and deliver an
elevated radiation dose. Lastly, we show how an external
device carried by the attacker with no access to the con-
sole can exploit a physical side-channel to capture naked
images of the subject being scanned. These attacks are, in
general, less practical than the techniques we demonstrate
for hiding contraband, and their limitations highlight a
series of conservative engineering choices by the system
designers that should serve as positive examples for future
AITs.
Finally, we attempt to draw broader lessons from these
ﬁndings (Section 5). Our results suggest that while the
Secure 1000 is effective against naïve attackers, it is not
able to guarantee either efﬁcacy or privacy when subject
to attack by an attacker who is knowledgeable about its
inner workings. While some of the detailed issues we
describe are speciﬁc to the scanner model we tested, the
root cause seems to be the failure of the system design-
ers and deployers to think adversarially. This pattern is
familiar to security researchers: past studies of voting
machines [4], cars [23] and medical devices [13] have
all revealed cyberphysical systems that functioned well
under normal circumstances but were not secure in the
face of attack. Thus, we believe this study reinforces
the message that security systems must be subject to ad-
versarial testing before they can be deemed adequate for
widespread deployment.
Research safety and ethics. Since the Secure 1000
emits ionizing radiation, it poses a potential danger to
the health of scan subjects, researchers, and passers by.
Our institutional review board determined that our study
did not require IRB approval; however, we worked closely
with research affairs and radiation safety staff at the uni-
versity that hosted our device to minimize any dangers
and assure regulatory compliance. To protect passers by,
our device was sited in a locked lab, far from the hallway,
and facing a thick concrete wall. To protect researchers,
we marked a 2 m region around the machine with tape;
no one except the scan subject was allowed inside this
region while high voltage was applied to the X-ray tube.
We obtained a RANDO torso phantom [33], made from a
material radiologically equivalent to soft tissue cast over
a human skeleton, and used it in place of a human subject
for all but the ﬁnal conﬁrmatory scans. For these ﬁnal
scans we decided, through consultation with our IRB,
that only a PI would be used as a scan subject. Experi-
ments involving weapons were conducted with university
approval and in coordination with the campus police de-
partment and all ﬁrearms were unloaded and disabled.
We disclosed our security-relevant ﬁndings and suggested
procedural mitigations to Rapiscan and the Department
of Homeland Security ahead of publication.

2 The Rapiscan Secure 1000
The Secure 1000 was initially developed in the early
1990s by inventor Steven W. Smith [42, 44]. In 1997,
Rapiscan Systems acquired the technology [43] and be-
gan to produce the Rapiscan Secure 1000. In 2007, the
TSA signed a contract with Rapiscan to procure a cus-
tomized version of the Secure 1000 for deployment in
airport passenger screening [47].
We purchased a Rapiscan Secure 1000 from an eBay
seller who had acquired it in 2012 at a surplus auction

from a U.S. Government facility located in Europe [17].
The system was in unused condition. It came with operat-
ing and maintenance manuals as well as detailed schemat-
ics, which were a signiﬁcant aid to reverse engineering.
The system consists of two separate components: the
scanner unit, a large enclosure that handles X-ray genera-
tion and detection under the control of a special purpose
embedded system, and the user console, a freestanding
cabinet that contains a PC with a keyboard and screen.
The two components are connected by a 12 m cable.
The system we tested is a dual pose model, which
means that the subject must turn around in order to be
scanned from the front and back in two passes. TSA
screening checkpoints used the Secure 1000 single pose
model [32], which avoids this inconvenience by scanning
from the front and back using a pair of scanner units.
Our system was manufactured in about September 2006
and includes EPROM software version 2.1. Documents
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act suggest
that more recent versions of the hardware and software
were used for airport screening [45, 52], and we highlight
some of the known differences below. Consequently,
we focus our analysis on fundamental weaknesses in the
Secure 1000 design that we suspect also affect newer
versions. A detailed analysis of TSA models might reveal
additional vulnerabilities.
2.1 Backscatter Imaging
X-ray backscatter imaging exploits the unique properties
of ionizing radiation to penetrate visual concealment and
detect hidden contraband. The physical process which
generates backscatter is Compton scattering, in which a
photon interacts with a loosely bound or free electron and
scatters in an unpredictable direction [7]. Other interac-
tions, such as the photoelectric effect, are possible, and
the fraction of photons that interact and which particular
effect occurs depends on each photon’s energy and the
atomic composition of the mass. For a single-element
material, the determining factor is its atomic number Z,
while a compound material can be modeled by producing
an “effective Z,” or Zeff [46].
Under constant-spectrum X-ray illumination,
the
backscattered intensity of a given point is largely de-
termined by the atomic composition of matter at that
location, and to a lesser extent its density. Thus, organic
materials, like ﬂesh, can be easily differentiated from
materials such as steel or aluminum that are made from
heavier elements.
The Secure 1000 harnesses these effects for contraband
screening by operating as a “reverse camera,” as illus-
trated in Figure 2. X-ray output from a centrally-located
tube (operating at 50 kVp and 5 mA) passes through slits
in shielding material: a ﬁxed horizontal slit directly in
front of a “chopper wheel,” a rapidly spinning disk with
Figure 2: Backscatter Imaging — An X-ray tube (A) mounted
on a platform travels vertically within the scanner. The X-rays
pass through a spinning disk (B) that shapes them into a horizon-
tally scanning beam. Some photons that strike the target (C) are

energy over time. Adapted from U.S. Patent 8,199,996 [16].
four radial slits. This results in a narrow, collimated X-
ray beam, repeatedly sweeping across the imaging ﬁeld.
During a scan, which takes about 5.7 s, the entire X-ray
assembly moves vertically within the cabinet, such that
the beam passes over every point of the scene in a series
of scan lines.
As the beam sweeps across the scene, a set of 8 large X-
ray detectors measures the intensity of the backscattered
radiation at each point, by means of internal photomulti-
plier tubes (PMTs). The Secure 1000 combines the output
of all 8 detectors, and sends the resulting image signal
to the user console, which converts the time-varying sig-
nal into a 160× 480 pixel monochrome image, with the
intensity of each pixel determined by the Zeff value of
the surface of the scan subject represented by that pixel
location.
2.2 Subsystems
Operator interface. The operator interacts with the Se-
cure 1000 through the user console, a commodity x86 PC
housed within a lockable metal cabinet. With our system,
the user console is connected to the scanner unit via a
serial link and an analog data cable. Documents released
by the TSA indicate that airport checkpoint models were
conﬁgured differently, with an embedded PC inside the
scanner unit linked to a remote operator workstation via a
dedicated Ethernet network [45, 52].
On our unit, the operator software is an MS-DOS ap-
plication called SECURE65.EXE that launches automat-
ically when the console boots.
(TSA models are ap-
parently Windows-based and use different operator soft-
ware [45, 47].) This software is written in a BASIC vari-

ﬁrst and most obvious question to ask is how effectively
the Secure 1000 detects contraband.
To make the discussion concrete, we consider the ma-
chine as it was typically used by the TSA for airport
passenger screening. Under TSA procedures, subjects
were imaged from the front and back, but not from the
sides. A trained operator inspected the images and, if an
