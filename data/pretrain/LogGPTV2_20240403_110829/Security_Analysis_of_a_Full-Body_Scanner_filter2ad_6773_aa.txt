**Abstract:**
Advanced imaging technologies (AITs) are a new class of screening systems used in airports and other sensitive environments to detect both metallic and nonmetallic contraband. This paper presents the first independent security evaluation of the Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner, which was widely deployed at U.S. airport checkpoints from 2009 to 2013. Our findings indicate that the system provides weak protection against adaptive adversaries: it is possible to conceal knives, guns, and explosives by exploiting the properties of the deviceâ€™s backscatter X-ray technology. We also investigate cyber-physical threats and propose novel attacks using malicious software and hardware, which can compromise the effectiveness, safety, and privacy of the device. Overall, our findings highlight the need for better design, evaluation, and operation of AITs, and contribute to the ongoing public debate on their use.

## 1. Introduction

In response to evolving terrorist threats, including non-metallic explosive devices and weapons, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has adopted advanced imaging technology (AIT) as the primary passenger screening method at nearly 160 airports nationwide. Introduced in 2009 and deployed at a cost exceeding $1 billion, AIT is claimed by the TSA to be the best method for detecting concealed anomalies without physical contact. Despite its critical role in transportation security, AIT has generated significant controversy, with concerns about safety, privacy, and effectiveness. The lack of transparency regarding technical details has limited the ability of policymakers, experts, and the public to assess these claims.

To address this, we present the first independent experimental analysis of an AIT, specifically the Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner. Our study evaluates the hardware and software of the Secure 1000, providing insights into the adequacy of testing and evaluation procedures and highlighting broader security concerns, including cyber-physical threats. Although the Secure 1000 is no longer used in U.S. airports, it remains in use at other government facilities. Our analysis includes redacting sensitive details to mitigate the risk of misuse.

### 2.1 Backscatter Imaging

The Secure 1000 uses backscatter X-ray imaging, which exploits the Compton scattering effect to penetrate visual concealment and detect hidden contraband. The intensity of backscattered radiation is largely determined by the atomic composition and density of the material. Organic materials, such as flesh, can be easily distinguished from heavier elements like steel or aluminum. The Secure 1000 operates as a "reverse camera," where X-rays from a centrally located tube pass through slits in shielding material, creating a narrow, collimated beam that sweeps across the imaging field. The backscattered radiation is measured by a set of X-ray detectors, and the resulting signal is converted into a monochrome image displayed on the user console.

### 2.2 Subsystems

The operator interacts with the Secure 1000 through a user console, which is a commodity x86 PC housed in a lockable metal cabinet. The console is connected to the scanner unit via a serial link and an analog data cable. The operator software is an MS-DOS application called SECURE65.EXE, which launches automatically when the console boots. TSA models, however, use Windows-based software and a different configuration.

## 3. Physical Security Evaluation

We tested the Secure 1000's effectiveness in detecting contraband by experimenting with various concealment methods. While the device performs well against naive adversaries, more sophisticated attackers can exploit fundamental limitations of backscatter imaging to defeat it. We demonstrate that an adaptive adversary can confidently smuggle contraband past the scanner by carefully arranging it on their body, obscuring it with other materials, or properly shaping it. These techniques allowed us to hide firearms, knives, plastic explosive simulants, and detonators. Simple procedural changes, such as performing supplemental scans from the sides or additional screening with a magnetometer, can reduce but not eliminate these threats.

## 4. Cyber-Physical Security Evaluation

We evaluated the Secure 1000 as a cyber-physical system and experimented with three types of novel attacks:
1. **Contraband Invisibility:** Malware infecting the operator's console can selectively render contraband invisible upon receiving a "secret knock" from the attacker.
2. **Safety Interlocks Bypass:** Software-based attacks can potentially bypass the scanner's safety interlocks and deliver an elevated radiation dose.
3. **Privacy Violation:** An external device carried by the attacker can exploit a physical side-channel to capture naked images of the subject being scanned.

While these attacks are less practical than those for hiding contraband, they highlight the importance of robust security measures in the design of AITs.

## 5. Broader Lessons

Our findings suggest that while the Secure 1000 is effective against naive attackers, it fails to guarantee efficacy or privacy when subjected to attacks by knowledgeable adversaries. This pattern is common in security research, where systems function well under normal circumstances but are vulnerable to targeted attacks. Therefore, security systems must undergo adversarial testing before widespread deployment.

### Research Safety and Ethics

Given the potential health risks associated with ionizing radiation, we took extensive precautions to ensure the safety of researchers and subjects. Our institutional review board determined that IRB approval was not required, but we worked closely with radiation safety staff to minimize risks. Experiments involving weapons were conducted with university approval and in coordination with the campus police department.
