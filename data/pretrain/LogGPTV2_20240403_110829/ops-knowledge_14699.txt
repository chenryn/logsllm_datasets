It seems like you're encountering an issue with Python 3.5.2 on your Windows 8 computer. When you try to check the version using `python --version` in the Command Prompt, you receive the error: "python is not recognized as an internal or external command...". Additionally, you mentioned that you cannot find any files named `python` on your computer, even after searching through hidden files and using the File Explorer search feature. You have attempted to install Python three times, but the problem persists.

Here are some steps to help resolve this issue:

1. **Verify Installation Directory**:
   - Ensure that Python is installed correctly by checking the installation directory. Typically, it would be in a location such as `C:\Python35-32` or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32`.

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Open the Start Menu, type `Environment Variables`, and select "Edit the system environment variables".
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - In the Environment Variables window, look for the `Path` variable in the "System variables" section and click "Edit".
   - Ensure that the path to the Python executable (e.g., `C:\Python35-32\`) is included in the `Path` variable. If it is not, add it.

3. **Reinstall Python**:
   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to reinstall Python.
   - Download the latest version of Python 3.5.2 from the official Python website.
   - During the installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" at the beginning of the installation process.
   - Note the installation directory during the setup.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - After reinstallation, open a new Command Prompt window and type `python --version` to verify that Python is now recognized.
