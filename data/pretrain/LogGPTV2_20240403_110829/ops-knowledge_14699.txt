User: I have installed Python 3.5.2 on my windows 8 computer, I tried in cmd python --version and it gave me that stupid error: 
"python is not recognized as an internal or external command..."
I also have no files named python on my computer anywhere. I used the search feature on file explorer and I've search manually. I even looked through the hidden files. I have tried to install Python 3 times and the same thing keeps happening. Any help appreciated.
Assistant: You may try to use which python to find out the location of python in your computer. If it doesn't work and you cannot find where is the your installed directory, you may need to reinstall and make sure you remember the installation directory and add it as a environment variable in windows system.
