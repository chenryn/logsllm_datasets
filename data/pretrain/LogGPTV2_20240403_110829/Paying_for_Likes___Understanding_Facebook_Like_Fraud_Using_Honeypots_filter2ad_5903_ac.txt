who did not like any of our pages. Table 3 (sixth column) reports,
for each provider, the overall number of friendship relationships
between likers that involved users associated with the provider.
In Figure 3(a), we plot the social graph induced by such friend-
ship relations (likers who did not have friendship relations with any
other likers were excluded from the graph). Based on the resulting
social structure, we suggest that:
1. Dense relations between likers from BoostLikes point to
an interconnected network of real users, or fake users who
mimic complex ties to pose as real users;
2. The pairs (and occasionally triplets) that characterize Social-
Formula likers might indicate a different strategy of con-
structing fake networks, mitigating the risk that identiﬁcation
of a user as fake would consequently bring down the whole
connected network of fake users; and
3. The friendship relations between AuthenticLikes and Mam-
mothSocials likers might indicate that the same operator
manages both services.
We also considered indirect links between likers, through mutual
friends. Table 3 reports the overall number of 2-hop relationships
between likers from the associated provider. Figure 3(b) plots the
relations between likers who either have a direct relation or a mu-
tual friend, clearly pointing to the presence of relations between
likers from the same provider. These tight connections, along with
the number of their friends, suggest that we only see a small part
of these networks. (In fact, like farms sell packages of as many
as 50k likes.) For SocialFormula, AuthenticLikes, and Mammoth-
Socials, we also observe many isolated pairs and triplets of likers
who are not connected. One possible explanation is that farm users
create fake Facebook accounts and keep them separate from their
personal accounts and friends. In contrast, the BoostLikes network
is well-connected.

We then looked at the other pages liked by proﬁles attracted to
our honeypot pages. In Figure 4(a) and 4(b), respectively, we plot

the distribution of the number of page likes for Facebook ads’ and
like farm campaigns’ users. To draw a baseline comparison, we also
collected page like counts from a random set of 2000 Facebook
users, extracted from an unbiased sample of Facebook user pop-
ulation. The original sample was crawled for another project [9],
obtained by randomly sampling Facebook public directory which
lists all the IDs of searchable proﬁles.
We observed a large variance in the number of pages liked, rang-
ing from 1 to 10,000. The median page like count ranged between
600 and 1000 for users from the Facebook campaigns and between
1200 and 1800 for those from like farm campaigns, with the ex-
ception of the BL-USA campaign (median was 63). In contrast, the
median page like count for our baseline Facebook user sample was
34. The page like counts of our baseline sample mirrored numbers
reported in prior work, e.g., according to [16], the average number
of pages liked by Facebook users amounts to roughly 40. In other
words, our honeypot pages attracted users that tend to like signiﬁ-
cantly more pages than regular Facebook users. Since our honeypot
pages both for Facebook and like farm campaigns explicitly indi-
cated they were not “real”, we argue that a vast majority of the
garnered likes are fake. We argue that these users like a large num-
ber of pages because they are probably reused for multiple “jobs”
and also like “normal” pages to mimic real users.2
To conﬁrm our hypothesis, for each pair of campaigns, we plot
their Jaccard similarity. Speciﬁcally, let Sk denote the set of pages
liked by a user k: the Jaccard similarity between the set of likes
by likers of two campaigns A and B, which we plot in Fig-
2Facebook does not impose any limit on the maximum number of
page likes per user.

and B = (cid:83)
between A(cid:48) = (cid:83)
∀i∈A Si
∀j∈B Sj. We also plot, in Figure 5(b), the similarity
∀j∈B j, i.e., the similarity
∀i∈A i and B(cid:48) = (cid:83)
between the set of likers of the different campaigns.
Note from Figure 5 that FB-IND, FB-EGY, and FB-ALL have
relatively large (Jaccard) similarity with each other. In addition, the
SF-USA and SF-ALL pair and the AL-USA and MS-USA pair also
have relatively large Jaccard similarity. These ﬁndings suggest that
the same fake proﬁles are used in multiple campaigns by a like farm
(e.g., SF-ALL and SF-USA). Moreover, some fake proﬁles seem to
be shared by different like farms (e.g., AL-USA and MS-USA),
suggesting that they are run by the same operator.
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper presented a comparative measurement study of Face-
book page promotion methods, aiming to shed light on like farms’
activities. We identiﬁed two main modi operandi: (1) some farms,
like SocialFormula and AuthenticLikes, seem to be operated by
bots and do not really try to hide the nature of their operations,
as demonstrated by large bursts of likes and the limited number of
friends per proﬁle; (2) other farms, like BoostLikes, follow a much
stealthier approach, aiming to mimic regular users’ behavior, and
rely on their large and well-connected network structure to dissem-
inate the target likes while keeping a small count of likes per user.
For the latter, we also observed a high number of friends per proﬁle
and a “reasonable” number of likes.
A month after the campaigns, we checked whether or not lik-
ers’ accounts were still active: as shown in Table 1, only one ac-
count associated with BoostLikes was terminated, as opposed to 9,

20, and 44 for the other like farms. 11 accounts from the regular
Facebook campaigns were also terminated. Although occurring not
so frequently, the accounts’ termination might be indicative of the
disposable nature of fake accounts on most like farms, where “bot-
like" patterns are actually easy to detect. It also mirrors the chal-
lenge Facebook is confronted by, with like farms such as Boost-
Likes that exhibit patterns closely resembling real users’ behavior,
thus making fake like detection quite difﬁcult.
We stress that our ﬁndings do not necessarily imply that adver-
tising on Facebook is ineffective, since our campaigns were specif-
ically designed to avert real users. However, our work provides
strong evidence that likers attracted on our honeypot pages, even
when using legitimate Facebook campaigns, are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from typical Facebook users, which conﬁrms the concerns
about the genuineness of these likes. We also show that most fake
likes exhibit some peculiar characteristics – including demograph-
ics, likes, temporal and social graph patterns – that can and should
be exploited by like fraud detection algorithms.
Besides the design of detection techniques, items for future work
include larger and more diverse honeypots measurements as well
as longer observation of removed likes. Also, as suggested in prior
work [4], fake likes might be generated via fake accounts, malware,
malicious browser extensions, credential stealing, and social engi-
neering, thus prompting the need for further investigation of fake
likes’ origin.
