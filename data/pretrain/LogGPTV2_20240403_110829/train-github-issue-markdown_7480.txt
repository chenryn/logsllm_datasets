I am using popovers for the What is this? link for a credit card verification
number field (see attached images). The popover contains an HTML table to
format the text and image and is brought in via a PHP require() statement.
The line of HTML used for this is as follows:  
"> What is this?
Then table code is as follows:  
This number is required & recorded as an
additional security precaution.The 3-digit, non-embossed number printed at the
right of the signature panel on the back of your card immediately following
the account number.
Please note that the arrow of the popover is not aligned with the link as it
should be. When I tried to set the data-location argument to "top", the
popover was still positioned too low and completedly obscured the link,
thereby preventing me from clicking it to dismiss the popover.
Also please note that when the table content is removed, the arrow returns to
a location approximating the correct location and the title is not pinned to
the top as advertised regardless of content presence.
No modifications were made to any Bootstrap CSS rules or Javascript code nor
are there any CSS rules that supersede those published for a popover.
