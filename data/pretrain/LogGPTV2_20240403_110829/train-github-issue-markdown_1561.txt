I am currently working on developing a connection plugin that uses guestfish to directly modify a disk image. During my testing with the development version (commit `07a0059`), I encountered several issues, including the following:

When running the following command:
```shell
ansible -vvv all -c guestfs -i 'Fedora-Cloud-Atomic-23-20151215.x86_64.qcow2:/dev/sda1,' -m ping
```

The output was:
```shell
Using /home/misc/.ansible.cfg as config file
Unexpected Exception: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'
```

The full traceback is as follows:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/misc/checkout/git/ansible/bin/ansible", line 85, in <module>
    sys.exit(cli.run())
  File "/home/misc/checkout/git/ansible/lib/ansible/cli/adhoc.py", line 187, in run
    result = self._tqm.run(play)
  File "/home/misc/checkout/git/ansible/lib/ansible/executor/task_queue_manager.py", line 237, in run
    play_return = strategy.run(iterator, play_context)
  File "/home/misc/checkout/git/ansible/lib/ansible/plugins/strategy/linear.py", line 217, in run
    task_vars = self._variable_manager.get_vars(loader=self._loader, play=iterator._play, host=host, task=task)
  File "/home/misc/checkout/git/ansible/lib/ansible/vars/__init__.py", line 245, in get_vars
    all_vars = combine_vars(all_vars, host.get_vars())
  File "/home/misc/checkout/git/ansible/lib/ansible/inventory/host.py", line 129, in get_vars
    results['inventory_hostname_short'] = self.name.split('.')[0]
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'
```

Upon further investigation, I discovered that the function at [this location](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/parsing/utils/addresses.py#L167) filters out non-standard addresses and returns `None, None` unless the input is carefully formatted. This behavior also affects other connection plugins such as `chroot`, `jail`, and potentially `docker`.

To resolve this issue, it may be necessary to ensure that the input provided to the function is correctly formatted or to modify the function to handle `None` values more gracefully.
