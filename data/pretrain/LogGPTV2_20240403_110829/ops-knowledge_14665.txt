User: I compiled Python 2.6.6 with google-perf tools (tcmalloc) library to eliminate some of the memory issues I was having with the default 2.6.5. After getting 2.6.6 going it seems to not work becuase I think having issues with the default 2.6.5 install in Ubuntu. Will none of the binaries installed from the software channel like wxPython and setuptools work properly with 2.6.6. Do these need to be recompiled? Any other suggestions to get it working smoothly. Can I still set 2.6.5 as default without changing the Path? The path looks in usr/local/bin first.
Assistant: If you compiled 2.6.6 and installed 2.6.5 from the repos, then ubuntu is having a conflict in finding what python you're using. 
I'm flagging this to move to Superuser.
