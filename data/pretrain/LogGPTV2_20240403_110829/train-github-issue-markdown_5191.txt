### Describe the issue with documentation
On https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/stable-rest-api-
ref.html#operation/patch_dag  
the payload in the example for PATCH /dags/{dag_id} suggest that it's possible
to update `schedule_interval` which is not true :
    {
    "is_paused": true,
    "schedule_interval": {
    "__type": "string",
    "days": 0,
    "seconds": 0,
    "microseconds": 0
    }
    }
### How to solve the problem
Update documentation removing the `schedule_interval` part from payload
