It looks like webpack try to bundle all of server side dependencies, so it
can't find module `fs`.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
`dotenv` in `_document` works with Next.js v6.
## Current Behavior
After upgrading from v5 to v6, it throws error:
    This dependency was not found:
    * fs in ./node_modules/dotenv/lib/main.js
    To install it, you can run: npm install --save fs
    (node:6389) DeprecationWarning: Module.chunks: Use Module.forEachChunk/mapChunks/getNumberOfChunks/isInChunk/addChunk/removeChunk instead

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. use `dotenv` in `_doucment`
  2. upgrade to Next.js v6
