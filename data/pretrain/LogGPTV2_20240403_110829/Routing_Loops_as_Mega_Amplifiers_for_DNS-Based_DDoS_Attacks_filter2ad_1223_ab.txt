scan more than 445 million hosts from the IPv6 Hitlist Service [17].
Figure 2 shows the measurement setup for the IPv4 scan. We run our exper-
iments on top of the existing measurement infrastructure and use our custom
scanner1 capable of sending DNS packets in bulk [53]. Nevertheless, any other
DNS scanner such as zdns,2 would achieve the same goal. We set up an authori-
tative nameserver for dnsdrakkarv4.com domain name and all its subdomains.
We encode the two following pieces of information in each queried domain: a ran-
dom string (xxxxxxxx in Fig. 2) and the hexadecimally-encoded IPv4 address
of the query target (01020304 for 1.2.3.4). In IPv6, we encode the target IPv6
address as a network byte order 32-bit integer. The encoded address is used to
attribute each domain name to the scanned destination address. As a result, all
domain names uniquely identify each sent request. Importantly, we capture all
the incoming requests on the authoritative nameserver and all the responses on
the scanner.

We have run our scans from one vantage point. Although we plan to acquire
more vantage points at diﬀerent locations, we later show in Sect. 5 that the
great majority of all the routing loops involve destination autonomous systems,
so they can be triggered regardless of the measurement vantage point.
5 Scan Results
In this section, we ﬁrst present the results of the latest Internet-wide IPv4 DNS
scan (Sect. 5.1). We next run traceroute measurements towards the biggest
ampliﬁers and identify routing loops (Sect. 5.2). Finally, we present the results
of our two-year DNS measurement study in IPv4 and IPv6 (Sect. 5.3).
5.1
Internet Scan
We launched the latest Internet-wide IPv4 DNS scan in October 2021. In total,
we sent more than 3 billion DNS A requests (one to each routable IP address) and
received 7.6 million responses on the scanner. From each DNS response packet,
we retrieve the following ﬁelds: the queried domain name (remember that each
domain name is globally unique as it encodes the destination IP address to which
we send the request), the source IP address of the response (can be the same as
the destination IP address or diﬀerent, in case the destination is a transparent
forwarder [40]) and the DNS response code. We refer to each response as a
three-tuple (source IP address, domain name, response code). Whenever we see
a response tuple more than once, we refer to it as a repeating response.
Table 1 presents the results. We assign each repeating response to one of
the three groups (ﬁrst column) based on the number of times the response was
received. We received 15,955 unique repeating responses in total. The ﬁrst group
(2–9 repeating responses) is the largest one, although the average ampliﬁcation
factor remains low (2.1 packets). Previous work analyzed the queries on root
nameservers and found many repeating (with diﬀerent query IDs) and identical
(with same query IDs) requests [9,59]. These were most probably results of con-
ﬁguration errors. Consequently, such repeating requests could produce repeating
responses to our scanning host. As suggested by Bock et al. [5], responses sent
more than 10 times are likely to be triggered by routing loops. If the TTL of the
initial request is gradually decreased to 0, such a loop is ﬁnite. These responses

belong to the second group (10–254 repeating responses). Note that in this case,
the maximum count of received responses (254 responses) is an overestimation,
as we would need to subtract from the maximum TTL (255 hops) the num-
ber of hops to reach the ampliﬁer [5]. Finally, the third group (255+ repeating
responses) contains the smallest number of response tuples, but the average
PAF is very high (927,796 packets). The biggest ampliﬁer seen during this scan
triggered 46.7 million responses during 7 h.
We use the CAIDA’s AS Rank dataset [7] to map autonomous system
numbers (ASNs) to organization names and countries. All the destination
autonomous systems originate from 133 countries, mostly from Brazil, India,
and the USA. Table 2 presents the top 10 organizations (anonymized) in terms
of the number of triggered repeating responses. The number one of the ranking (a
Philippine telecommunications service provider) triggered many more responses
to our scanning host than any other autonomous system.
We would expect that one DNS A request triggers repeating responses from
the same source IP address and of the same DNS response type. In other words,
one request triggers one repeating response tuple. Nevertheless, in groups 1
and 2, there are more repeating response tuples (second column of Table 1)
than scanned destination IP addresses (third column of Table 1). The reason
is that certain DNS requests triggered replies from diﬀerent IP addresses. In
particular, we found 15 destination IPs triggering repeating responses from 2 or
more source addresses. Park et al. [42] have shown how a single request to the
DNS forwarder was processed by 89 diﬀerent recursive resolvers (as seen on the
authoritative nameserver). If such a forwarder is transparent (i.e., it forwards the
request without changing the source IP address ﬁeld), the replies from diﬀerent
recursive resolvers will be returned to the original requester. Consequently, we
could cumulate PAFs from all responses triggered by a single request.

The received DNS responses are of ﬁve following types (as deﬁned in RFC-
1035 [35]): NOERROR (13,797 responses), SERVFAIL (1,684 responses), REFUSED
(430 responses), NXDOMAIN (41 responses) and NOTIMP (3 responses). We take
a closer look at 345 NOERROR responses from groups 2 and 3. Although this
response code signals that the request was completed successfully, the answer
section of the DNS packet may have been manipulated. Surprisingly, 76% of
these responses did not contain the A record in the answer at all. As for the
remaining non-empty responses, we did not detect any manipulation.
If the majority of NOERROR responses are empty, we raise the question of
whether the authoritative nameserver for our test domain dnsdrakkarv4.com
experienced any signiﬁcant load from repeating requests. Speciﬁcally, we have
analyzed 444 repeating responses from groups 2 and 3. As expected, the great
majority of domain names (350 domains) were never queried on the authorita-
tive nameserver, which suggests that attackers can safely reuse existing domain
names in their queries without domain name operators noticing any abnormal
activity.
In the attempt to characterize the devices responsible for response packet
ampliﬁcation, we made an assumption that we might have been dealing with
national censors’ middleboxes, as suggested by Bock et al. [5]. Censored Planet
initiative [10] is constantly measuring the presence of censorship worldwide. More
speciﬁcally, their Hyperquack [56] project infers application-layer blocking. We
checked whether the Hyperquack data contains measurements towards destina-
tions that triggered response ﬂoods but we did not ﬁnd any overlap between
the two datasets. We next referred to Tracebox [13] – a middlebox detection
software that relies on ICMP time-exceeded replies to check whether the orig-
inally sent packet was modiﬁed and in which way. We run tracebox towards
all the destination IP addresses from groups two and three. We notice modi-
ﬁcations (such as unexpected source/destination addresses or ports, checksum,
etc.) on the way to each measured host. However, when compared to a random
sample of routable IP addresses (that did not trigger any ampliﬁcation), there
are no speciﬁc packet modiﬁcations that would distinguish the ampliﬁer group
from non-ampliﬁers. Therefore, identifying and characterizing those devices that
trigger response ﬂoods remains an open question.
5.2 Running Traceroute
The responses from the second and third groups (see Table 1 rows 2 and 3) are
likely to be caused by routing loops. One could use the traceroute [29] utility to
track the path a packet takes from the source to the destination and check for
the presence of loops. Augustin et al. [2] indicated, however, that traceroute does
not capture the complete view of the network, often showing anomalies (such as
loops) when there is router load balancing in place. To address this limitation,
we use Multilevel MDA-Lite Paris Traceroute [57]. This tool relies on the new
MDA-Lite algorithm to avoid inferring false links and to give a more accurate
view of the path between the measurement server and the destination.
