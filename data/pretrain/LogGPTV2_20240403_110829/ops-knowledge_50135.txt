### Issue Description

I have a TCP server written in Qt 4.7, which works well with a TCP client also written in Qt 4.7. I am attempting to connect and communicate with this server using a Python 2.7.3 client. The server process is started via an Apache HTTP request using `subprocess.call(path_to_server)`. My setup includes mod_wsgi 3.3 and Django 1.4.

### Problem Details

- **Connection Establishment**: The connection between the Python client and the Qt server is established without any issues.
- **Random Errors**:
  - **Broken Pipe (Errno 32)**: When sending data using `socket.send()`, I occasionally encounter a `[Errno 32] Broken pipe` exception. This happens randomly; for example, I can send the same message 10 times, and it may be sent 0 to 10 times.
  - **Transport Endpoint Not Connected (Errno 107)**: Similar random behavior occurs with `socket.shutdown()` and `socket.close()`. I can send a disconnect command multiple times, and it will sometimes disconnect, but other times, I receive a `[Errno 107] Transport endpoint is not connected` exception.
  - **Netstat Output**: Running `netstat -nap` indicates that the connection is established.

### Environment and Testing

- **Python Shell**: When running the same client script in the Python 2.7 shell, everything works as expected.
- **Operating System**:
  - **Windows 7**: The setup works correctly on Windows 7 with the same Apache, mod_wsgi, Python, and Django configuration. The TCP server is also compatible with Windows.
  - **CentOS 6.2 (32-bit)**: The error occurs on CentOS 6.2 (32-bit).

### Temporary Solution

To mitigate the issue, I modified the Apache settings as follows:

```apache
KeepAlive On
MaxKeepAliveRequests 0
KeepAliveTimeout 5
```

This change has improved the situation, but I am still investigating to determine if this is a proper long-term solution.

### Further Investigation

I will continue to investigate the root cause of the problem and verify if the above Apache settings are a suitable resolution.
