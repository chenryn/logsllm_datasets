User: Our application needs to integrate a third-party service API interface, how to debug the interface and handle exceptions?
Assistant: The interface debugging steps are as follows: 1. Confirm the parameters required by the interface and the returned results. 2. Use tools (such as Postman or curl) to send requests to the API, and check whether the returned results meet expectations. 3. Monitor network requests, response time and other indicators during the API call process to locate problems. The exception handling steps are as follows: 1. According to the result returned by the API, judge whether it is successful or not, and handle the error situation. 2. Add an exception handling mechanism when calling the API to handle abnormal situations that may occur during the API call, such as network interruption, timeout, etc. 3. Record logs for locating and troubleshooting errors.
