The Boston UA is overseen by nine Jurisdictional Points of Contact, who provide guidance to an established 
Communications Interoperability Subcommittee (CIS).  Partnerships among member agencies are provided 
through a combination of formal and informal agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding); most of the 
agreements are among local first responder agencies.  The Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan 
(TICP) Peer Review noted that “the panel was impressed with the strength of long-term interoperability 
shown through this planning process” and a regional 5-year strategic plan was included as an appendix to 
Boston’s TICP.  Year-to-year grant funds have provided for the majority of regional communications 
priorities, but the Boston UA has not developed long-term funding strategies (in addition to grants) for 
addressing lifecycle costs.  Leaders in the UA (e.g., MBHSR and Massachusetts Executive Office of Public 
Safety are in full support of communications interoperability efforts) appear to recognize the importance of 
interoperability, and this executive involvement will be critical to ensuring the long-term success for 
interoperability in the UA.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Expand CIS membership to include public support disciplines, state, and federal agencies (e.g., hospitals, 
public health) 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
interoperability planning and sustainable funding, and encourage regional funding alternatives and 
sources (in addition to grants)  
• 
Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that would more fully support regional 
communications interoperability 
• 
Continue to involve senior government leadership on interoperability and encourage long-term regional 
funding plans 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met

The Boston UA incorporated existing SOPs into the development of its TICP, including procedures for the 
Boston Area Police Emergency Radio Network system and MetroFire.  The TICP expands these policies to 
support multijurisdictional, multidiscipline communications interoperability throughout the area, and, as the 
TICP Peer Review noted, the Boston TICP “shows comprehensive cooperation and collaboration among the 
agencies in the region.”  The UA is beginning the process of disseminating the procedures to jurisdictions 
and agencies through TICP training.  This training will help address some gaps identified during the TICP 
validation exercise (e.g., use of agency identifiers), particularly for emergency medical services (EMS)

National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) and training was ongoing.  
The TICP validation exercise demonstrated some gaps with NIMS/ICS (e.g., establishment of a unified 
command), which ongoing training planned by the area should address. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Document and distribute regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP) and put them into practice 
through regular training (e.g., in-service refreshers and basic training courses), exercises, and usage  
• 
Identify the title and source documentation for existing SOPs in the TICP

The Boston UA uses its shared systems and gateways (including console patches) on a daily basis.  Likewise, 
the use of a common channel plan was noted by the exercise evaluators as a best practice.  The UA 
incorporated local first responder agencies in its TICP validation exercise and demonstrated successful use of 
each category of interoperable equipment during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., Everett and Cambridge 
site responders uses each others’ shared channels on a routine basis and demonstrated proficiency with their 
use).  Officials within the UA indicated during their exercise “hotwash” that EMS had some difficulty 
communicating.  As a key component of the first response agencies, EMS capabilities for interoperable 
communications are a priority to address. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider adding interoperability as a component for all future exercises and day-to-day activities, as 
appropriate 
• 
Consider including additional local, state, and federal agencies (e.g., public health) in future exercises 
and day-to-day use

Interoperability in the area is achieved by exchanging of radios, sharing of channels, gateway solutions, and shared 
systems.  Five radio caches are available that contain radios in the very high frequency (VHF), ultra high frequency 
(UHF), and 800 megahertz (MHz) bands.  Additionally, a regional subscriber unit channel plan is in place—radios are 
programmed with a common set of shared channels and functions including one channel for each fire department and 
police department in the area.  Shared channels are available for use in each of the three prevalent frequency bands (i.e., 
VHF, UHF, and 800 MHz).  Six mobile gateway devices (either vehicle or trailer mounted) are available for use—two 
owned by Boston EMS and one each by Chelsea, the Massachusetts State Police, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation 
Authority, and the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services.  There are no fixed gateways in the UA.  The MBHSR 
has a 5-year strategic plan in place to ensure that the communications interoperable capabilities are continually being 
improved.  One plan for the future in the UA is to migrate all shared systems to the UHF frequency band.

The Southeast Michigan regional Interoperability Communications Committee was recently established to 
address specific communications interoperability in the UA.  After initially coming together to develop the 
Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), the group was formalized in October 2006 and began 
regularly meeting in November 2006.  The UA is making an effort to prioritize interoperable 
communications (e.g., developing and maintaining budgets and procuring communications equipment with 
consideration for interoperability) and has formal partnerships among organizations, but lacks formal, 
documented interoperability agreements outside of the TICP.  Beyond the UA’s efforts in creating the TICP, 
the documentation does not indicate that a regional strategic plan focused on interoperable communications 
exists except in the early planning stages.  Funding for interoperable communications is a high priority 
locally and organizations make their procurement decisions with consideration for regionwide 
interoperability.  However, the majority of funding is based on federal grants and therefore does not address 
recurring costs for equipment operations, maintenance, and improvements.  The Communications Committee 
must have the ability to work with high-level leadership who would be able to provide continued fiscal and 
political support for interoperable communications throughout the UA. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to meet regularly, include all agencies participating in public safety efforts in the UA, and 
define roles and responsibilities 
• 
Document and formalize the necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding), including local, 
state, and federal partnerships, to achieve regional communications interoperability goals 
• 
Develop a strategic plan with long-term interoperability goals (beyond the operational focus of the 
TICP), with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance  
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
interoperability planning and sustainable funding 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official, with political and fiscal authority, to specifically 
advocate for and focus on communications interoperability issues; consider establishing a direct line of 
communication among local and state agencies to promote consensus advocacy

procedures and not on regional authority or usage prioritization” and recommended that “[t]he site should 
consider moving towards consolidation of [regional] procedures.”  The Detroit UA has not yet distributed the 
newly created regional SOPs to all public safety agencies in the UA, although they did participate in a TICP 
Workshop in preparation for their validation exercise.  The Detroit UA is in the process of implementing the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), which implies that the UA 
is still in the earlier stages of implementing NIMS/ICS policies and procedures.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Review and update SOPs to ensure consistency with regional and statewide interoperability planning and 
implementation efforts  
• 
Develop, disseminate, and train on regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP 
Implementation Workshop) 
•

Agencies within the Detroit UA were able to achieve communications interoperability adequately within the 
area through their existing communications solutions (e.g., radio cache, shared system).  Although the 
Detroit officials indicated that interoperable communications equipment resources (e.g., radio cache, 
gateways) were used infrequently, the TICP validation exercise and After Action Report noted that users 
possessed the knowledge and skills to effectively employ the communications interoperability equipment.  
During the TICP validation exercise, the UA encountered repeated problems attempting to use gateways 
(e.g., gateways could not be activated at Wayne County Emergency Operations Center or the Mobile 
Command Center).  Additional steps, including regular training and exercise on available resources (such as 
gateways), would be beneficial in achieving multijurisdictional communications interoperability.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
(e.g., gateways) 
• 
Involve additional local, state, and federal agencies in training and exercises  
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Detroit UA has multiple very high frequency (VHF), ultra high frequency (UHF), and 800 megahertz (MHz) radio 
systems operating in analog and digital modes.  Communications interoperability is achieved through cached radios, 
enabling mobile and fixed gateways (including Codespear Smart Msg equipment) and shared channels, including those 
provided by the National Public Safety Policy Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) and the Michigan Public Safety 
Communication System (MPSCS).  Various agencies have access to the MPSCS 800 MHz digital trunked radios for 
command and control during multi-agency incidents.  The UA will use the shared channels on MPSCS and NPSPAC 
and other VHF and UHF mutual aid channels and gateways to increase interoperability.

In Minnesota, the “Twin Cities” have been designated as the state’s Urban Area (UA).  The Twin Cities are 
St. Paul and Minneapolis, but the UA has been designated to include all the cities, townships, and political 
subdivisions within and including the counties of Dakota, Hennepin, and Ramsey. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
The Urban Area Administrative Council oversees the Communications Subcommittee, which includes local, 
state, and federal representatives (e.g., Metropolitan Council, Department of Transportation, National Guard) 
and proactively recruits involvement by additional public safety organizations.  The Twin Cities have a 
strategic plan for interoperable communications that has been accepted by the participating organizations.  
Interoperable communications funding requirements are defined in the regional strategic plan, and through a 
variety of local resources (e.g., 9-1-1 surcharge and seatbelt fines), organizations within the Twin Cities UA 
procure equipment and develop budgets according to these strategic goals.  The identification of 
interoperable communications goals and this diversification of funding sources to support them demonstrates 
strong commitment to sustainable interoperability.  The UA’s leadership support these governance efforts 
and serves as an interoperability advocate to ensure long-term political and fiscal support for continued 
regional interoperability success. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Clarify that a process exists to review agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) and the strategic 
plan on a regular basis or after significant events or upgrades to ensure alignment with current 
interoperable communications needs 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The Twin Cities incorporated existing interoperable communications SOPs (regional policies and procedures 
were created in 1986) in creating the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  Since these SOPs 
were already well established and used frequently, the public safety agencies in the UA were well positioned 
to adopt the TICP.  In addition to widely disseminating these SOPs to the agencies in UA, the area is 
planning a large-scale Communications Center Manager training event.  The incorporation of legacy 
interoperable communications SOPs into the area’s current operating procedures and the significant level of 
training on the SOPs for first responders in the area is commendable and should be considered a best 
practice.  Additionally, according to evaluators, “participants as a whole demonstrated a fairly solid 
understanding of the SOPs outlined in the TICP” during the exercise.  The area implemented National 
Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) more than 1 year ago, which 
indicates that the agencies have spent some time aligning their prior command and control procedures to be 
NIMS compliant.  Although the participants experienced a few minor problems with command and control 
communications (e.g., naming conventions, initial unified command announcement), they demonstrated 
familiarity with the processes as noted in their exercise evaluations.  Officials in the area reported that they

are committed to continuing NIMS/ICS training and further implementation of the interoperable 
communications processes. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The Twin Cities report frequent use of their available means of interoperable communications (e.g., cache 
radios, gateways, shared channels, shared systems).  During the TICP validation exercise, participants were 
able to successfully establish interoperable communications among first responders and regional responders 
(e.g., Mall of America Security, Minnesota Department of Public Safety).  They demonstrated proficiency in 
use of cache radios, gateways, shared channels, and shared systems.  As noted by evaluators during the 
exercise, the “Twin Cities demonstrated a broad and largely effective use of interagency communications 
capabilities.”  As further illustration of the UA’s demonstrated familiarity with communications 
interoperability solutions, in a October 2006 real-world hazardous materials incident in the UA, over 100 
local, state, and federal response agencies were able to coordinate efforts to an impressive degree. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and 
day-to-day activities

The City of Minneapolis and Hennepin County agencies currently operate on the Allied Radio Matrix for Emergency 
Response (ARMER) systems.  The ARMER systems include an 800 megahertz (MHz) digital trunked system, a very 
high frequency (VHF) system, and an ultra high frequency (UHF) system.  The City of St. Paul, Dakota County, and 
Ramsey County operate on various 800 MHz, VHF, and UHF systems.  Interoperability is achieved using shared radios, 
gateways, console patches, and shared channels (e.g., ARMER 800 MHz, VHF, UHF, and National Public Safety 
Planning Advisory Committee 800 MHz frequencies). 
Ramsey County includes the City of St. Paul and is currently migrating to the ARMER radio system.  Dakota County 
will migrate to the ARMER system in 2007.  In addition, the metropolitan area, consisting of nine counties and 
including the three UA counties, is developing a 700 MHz wideband data interoperability solution.

Faced with disparate infrastructure within the area and across the state border, the Kansas City UA has developed a 
strong governance structure to address communications interoperability challenges.  The Regional Interoperability 
Committee (RIC) provides advice and guidance to the Public Safety Communications Board (PSCB), which has 
responsibility for coordinating communications interoperability.  While the PSCB is a formalized group, interoperability 
agreements among included agencies are generally informal.  The UA indicated that memoranda of understanding 
(MOU) have been developed and distributed, but some agencies have not yet signed them.  The Kansas City UA five-
year strategic plan that includes strategic interoperable communications efforts has been accepted by the Regional 
Homeland Security Coordinating Committee representing the region’s first responder agencies, and a process has been 
established to annually review the plan.  Kansas City officials indicated that they are working together to pursue 
regional funding, specifically for the implementation of the regional interoperable communications plan including 
regional voice and data communications.  The region has designated portions of Urban Area Security Initiative and 
other federal grants to complete the first phase of the Regional Area Multi-Band Integrated System (RAMBIS), which 
will link the UA’s three communications bands.  The documentation did not directly indicate whether communications 
interoperability efforts were driven by available grants or a long-term funding strategy that addresses lifecycle costs.
