It seems you are encountering issues when trying to activate a virtual environment on a Windows system. The `source` command, which is used to activate a virtual environment in Unix-based systems, is not recognized by the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure Python and Virtualenv are Installed:**
   - You mentioned using Python 7, but please note that the latest stable version of Python as of my last update is 3.9. Ensure you have the correct version installed.
   - Verify that `virtualenv` is installed. You can check this by running:
     ```sh
     pip show virtualenv
     ```

2. **Create the Virtual Environment:**
   - You have already created the virtual environment, but for clarity, the command should be:
     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Note that the `--no-site-packages` flag is deprecated and no longer needed.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows, you need to use the activation script provided in the `Scripts` directory of your virtual environment. Run the following command:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - This will activate the virtual environment, and you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

4. **Check the Activation:**
   - To verify that the virtual environment is activated, you can run:
     ```sh
     where python
     ```
   - This should point to the `python.exe` inside your `venv` directory.

5. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**
   - When you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:
     ```sh
     deactivate
     ```

### Example Commands

```sh
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Check the Python executable path
where python

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

### Additional Tips

- **Using Git Bash:**
  - If you are using Git Bash on Windows, you can use the `source` command with the appropriate path:
    ```sh
    source venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

- **Environment Variables:**
  - If you encounter issues with the `PATH`, ensure that the `venv\Scripts` directory is included in your system's `PATH` variable. However, this is generally not necessary if you are activating the environment correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to create and activate your virtual environment without any issues. If you still encounter problems, please provide more details about the error messages you are seeing.
