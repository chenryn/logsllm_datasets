Case no. 3: December 30, 1966. Haynesville (Louisiana) Ð Classi®cation: CE-2
The third case is drawn from the official U.S. files. It took place at 8:15 p.m.
on December 30, 1966, in the vicinity of Haynesville, Louisiana. The witness-
es are a professor of physics, Dr. G., and his family. Inquiries with the weather
bureau disclose that the weather was overcast, with fog and a light drizzle,
ceiling about three hundred feet, all parameters that are in agreement with the
witnesses’ statements. There was no thunderstorm.
In early 1967 the author came across this sighting while reviewing the files
of the U.S. Air Force as an associate of Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern
University. The report by Dr. G. and his family had not been followed up by
Air Force personnel, so we decided to pursue it on our own. Dr. G. told Dr.
Hynek and myself that he was driving north that night on U.S. Highway 79 be-
tween Haynesville and the Arkansas border when his wife called his attention
to a red-orange glow appearing through and above the trees ahead to their left.
They continued to observe it as they drove down the highway. It appeared as a
luminous hemisphere, pulsating regularly, ranging from dull red to bright or-
ange, with a period of about two seconds. There was no smoke or flame that
would have been characteristic of a fire. 
6The author wishes to thank David A. Newton for bringing to his attention some important corrections
and improvements to his initial calculations in this case and those that follow. (Private communication,
August 8, 1993).
When the car came to a point about one mile from the source of the light, it
suddenly brightened to a blinding white, washing out the headlights and cast-
ing sharp shadows. This burst of light not only forced Dr. G. to shield his eyes,
but it woke up his children, who had been sleeping in the back seat. After
about four seconds it returned to its red-orange appearance.
Several sightings were described by other persons in the area. One witness
reported that about six days before a similar bright light had been seen near the
same location.
When the University of Colorado received funding from the U.S. Air Force
for a scientific study of UFOs, the author called Dr. Edward Condon’s atten-
tion to this case. A field investigation was conducted by several scientists from
Boulder but failed to locate the actual site. Dr. Condon concluded in his pub-
lished report that the case was ªof interest,º and it remained as one of the many
unidentified sightings in the University of Colorado files (Condon, 1969). 
After the University of Colorado project was disbanded and after the Air
Force, following its recommendations, closed down its own Blue Book, study
of the case was resumed on a private basis. We came into contact with a quali-
fied investigator, Mr. W., who had also pursued his own research with Dr. G.
Through them the author learned that Mr. W. and Dr. G. had pinpointed the ac-
tual site where the object had hovered. The area in question is a clearing about
thirty feet in diameter, located to the west of some railroad tracks. The chief
dispatcher stated that no rolling equipment was within fifty miles of the loca-
tion that night. The nearest high-tension power lines are about nine miles away
to the west.
All the trees at the periphery of the clearing exhibited a blackening or burn-
ing of the bark in a direction pointing to the center of the area, as if they had
been exposed to an intense source of radiated energy. Clearly we would like to
know whether the wood was burned by light energy, direct heat, or chemical
combustion. From an estimate of the energy required to produce the depth of
the burn it may be possible to estimate the power of the source, assuming it
was located in the center of the clearing fifteen feet away.  However this work
has not been done.
Fortunately, there are other ways to arrive at a power estimate, as Dr. G. re-
alized when he saw that the light from the object washed out his own head-
lights about ten feet ahead of the car. This enabled him to equate the intensity
of the unknown object, which is given by its power output divided by the
square of the distance, to the intensity of his headlights, which is given by their
power output, known to be 150 watts, divided by the square of ten feet. This
gives a lower limit for the power output of the UFO.
The Condon report, which reprinted Dr. G.’s calculations, uses the very sim-
ple formula:
P= 150d2
(5)

where d = distance between the car and the object. 
This formula is arrived at as follows: Calling Ic the intensity of the car head-
lights at a distance of 10 feet ahead of the car, Iu the intensity of the unknown
source at distance d, and P the optical power output of the object we can write:
Ic= 150/(10 feet)2
(6)
and
Iu=P / d2
(7) 
The fact that the headlights were washed out by the unknown source at a ten-
foot distance provides a lower limit for Iu. If we assume that we can detect a
ªjust noticeable differenceº (JND) between Iu and (Iu + Ic) we write:
Iu= 100 Ic
(from Weber: JND curves)                             (8) 
which leads to:
P / d2= 100 (150 / 102)                                                (9)
or P= 150d2.
In his report, Dr. Condon estimated the distance at 2,400 feet, which gave an
energy of 9 ´ 108 W (900 megawatts) for the UFO. A more correct estimate is
given by the subsequent investigation since the clearing is actually located
1,800 feet from the observation point. The energy output becomes 5 ´ 108 W
(500 megawatts). These figures are approximations only: As David Newton
has since pointed out in correspondence with the author, the fact that the car
headlights were not radiating uniformly in all directions but were directed onto
the road by reflectors, should be taken into account in any refined calculations.
Case no. 4: November 5, 1976. Grenoble (France) Ð Classi®cation: MA-1
Another remarkable observation made near Grenoble, France, on November
5, 1976, by a senior French scientist is relevant here.  As in the previous case,
there were multiple witnesses and the duration was long enough to allow de-
tails of the object and its trajectory to be seen and recalled. There were two
other remarkable characteristics: first, it was possible to establish the distance
of the object with precision; second, the exceptional qualifications of one of
the witnesses provided some physical parameters that have rarely been avail-
able in UFO cases.
We are indebted to GEPAN, the French government’s official UFO investi-
gation task force (now known as SEPRA), for communicating to me the details
of the case, which the author had the opportunity to discuss with them at
length prior to visiting the site in 1988.7 In accordance with their policies, the
names of the witnesses have been changed. The official files, of course, con-
tain full particulars and in-depth interviews with all concerned.8
The first witness in the chronology of this observation is a Miss M., who was
watching television at her home in the town of Rives, near Grenoble. The time
was 8:08 p.m. She saw a bright light outside and called her father. Both went
out on the balcony and observed an intense white source crossing the sky at
high speed from the northwest to the southeast, disappearing behind the moun-
tains in the direction of Montand. The father, when interrogated by the gen-
darmes, stated that the light appeared to be spinning.
While these two witnesses were observing the object in Rives, a French
physicist we will call Dr. Serge was driving seven miles away near Voreppe on
the road that goes from Rives to Grenoble. He had just returned from Paris on a
plane that landed at Grenoble airport, and he was driving to his home. Looking
up, he saw a luminous disk moving in the sky.  He stopped his car and got out to
observe it carefully. The time was 8: 10 p.m.
The disk, according to Dr. Serge, was brighter than the full moon. It was
slightly flattened (with an aspect ratio of 0.9) and an angular diameter about
twelve arc minutes (the full moon has an angular diameter of about thirty arc
minutes). The object was white in the center and bluish-white at the periphery.
It was surrounded by an intense green halo about two or three arc minutes
thick.
At the beginning of the observation, the disk was almost directly overhead.
It flew at a constant velocity toward the east-southeast in less than eight sec-
onds, covering approximately 1.3 degrees of arc per second. At that point the
disk stopped, without changing size, and hovered for three to ten seconds.
Then it started again in a different direction, thirty degrees away from the pre-
vious course, at much greater speed, covering about eight degrees of arc per
second and passing in front of Le Taillefer Mountain, thirty-six kilometers
away. Dr. Serge lost sight of the disk when it passed behind Le N…ron Moun-
tain, nine kilometers away.
The whole sighting had lasted about twenty to twenty-five seconds and there
was absolutely no sound at any time. The sky was clear, no wind at ground
level, and the temperature was about 40 degrees F. Late in 1988 the author
drove through the area where the sighting had been made. The photographs
and the drawings included in the GEPAN report do not do justice to the
majesty of the site. Mountains rise on both sides of the Is†re River. In places
the road runs at the foot of sheer granite walls. This topography provides a fair
estimate of the object’s distance at various points, since it was seen flying be-
hind one mountain and in front of another.

It is noteworthy that the investigation by GEPAN disclosed that a similar
object had been seen three hours earlier about eighteen miles east of Rives,
leaving a trail, and that a bright disk was seen two hours later by the civilian
traffic controller in the tower of the military airport at Aulnat. Shortly after
8:05 p.m. that same day a witness located a few miles away near Vienne saw a
slightly flattened sphere, whose light was similar to that of a very bright neon
tube, with a fiery red-orange area underneath. It was about one-sixth of the di-
ameter of the full moon and was flying very fast from the west-northwest to the
east-southeast.
Given these detailed, competent observations, it is possible to bracket the
energy and speed of the object with some reasonable numbers.  From a careful
reconstruction of the sighting it was estimated that the object was flying at an
altitude of 1,500 to 2,500 feet, which would give it a diameter between six and
twenty feet and a speed approximating one mile per second, or 3,600 miles per
hour, during the second phase of its trajectory.  Assuming that the disk gave off
as much light as the full moon, as observed by Dr. Serge, its energy in the visi-
ble part of the spectrum was a modest 15 kW. This is only a minimum value,
based on the assumption that the landscape directly underneath the object was
illuminated with an intensity comparable to that of the full moon. If illumina-
tion at the much greater distance where Dr. Serge was located was also that of
the full moon we would be in conditions similar to those of case no. 2, with a
much higher power output value.
