When you have a one page site, and the navbar is collapsed (e.g. on an
iPhone),  
the 3-line collapse button is shown. Excellent.  
When you then click that button, the menu pops open. Good.
If you then click one of the menu items, the 'jump' happens, but the menu does
not collapse. Remember, it's a one page site, so the link refers to another
location on the same page (#-link).  
The user now has to click the 3-line collapse button again to close the menu.
Maybe it's easy to correct (by me), but if not, I hope you can fix it.
For an example (still based on bootstrap 2.3, because it's a live site):
