sure of the cost of non-cooperative behavior. For example
in Table 4 for B(5, 2) and γ = 0.3, we have 0.56/0.70 = 0.80
meaning that the system performance is degraded by 20%.
We notice that the system performance is only degraded by
7% in the case of γ = 0.7, showing that nodes are less self-
ish when the cost of a pseudonym change is large. The cost
FC in Table 4 shows the fraction of interactions in which
a pseudonym is changed. We observe that in general less
pseudonyms are changed with ˜θ∗
i,2 (20% decrease with re-
spect to the random strategy when γ = 0.3) showing that
less pseudonyms are needed.
n-player I-Game

Assume n ≤ N players meet at time t and take part in a
pseudonym change I-game. Let P r(K = k) be the probabil-
ity that k nodes cooperate. We can again obtain the thresh-
olds that deﬁne a BNE in the n-player game by comparing
the average payoﬀ of cooperation with that of defection, now
deﬁned as:

We denote the probability of cooperation qi = F (˜θi).
Assume that the thresholds ˜θ∗
i are all equal: We obtain
qi = q and thus have a symmetric equilibrium. Conse-
quently, the probability that k nodes cooperate is P r(K =
´qk(1−q)n−k. For example, consider the limit values
k) =`n

of q:
• If q → 0, then ˜θ∗
i = 0, P r(K > 0) = 0 and P r(K =
0) = 1. Thus, the All Defection equilibrium exists.
• If q → 1, then ˜θ∗

For intermediate values of q, we numerically derive the
thresholds ˜θ∗
i by solving Eq. (19) with Matlab (Figure 6).
For γ = 0.3, we observe that with a higher density of nodes
n, ˜θ∗
i,2 decreases, which means that players cooperate with a
lower probability. Similarly, ˜θ∗
i,3 disappears for large values
of n, which means that Always Cooperation is not a BNE
anymore. Yet in the case of β(5, 2), the All Cooperation
equilibrium ˜θ∗
i,4 persists. The reason is that with such a dis-
tribution of types, selﬁsh nodes need to cooperate more. For
a larger value γ = 0.7, we observe a similar behavior. Note
that with β(5, 2) an additional threshold equilibrium, de-
noted by ˜θ∗
i,3, appears in which nodes cooperate more when
n increases. Moreover, All Cooperation equilibrium survives
longer when γ increases.
7.4 Discussion
In summary, in I-games, we ﬁrst prove analytically the
existence and symmetry of BNE in 2-player games and then
obtain numerically three BNE for each possible distribution
of type. We observe that the intermediate BNE ˜θ∗
i,2 re-
duces the number of pseudonyms used (FC in Table 4) and
achieves a high level of privacy. However, non-cooperative
behavior aﬀects the achievable location privacy. In partic-
ular, we notice that a larger n encourages selﬁsh nodes to
not cooperate (Figure 6). In contrast, when the cost γ of
changing pseudonym is large, we observe that selﬁsh nodes
cooperate more, which means that a high cost of pseudo-
nyms provides an incentive to cooperate. In summary, even
with incomplete information, it is possible to ﬁnd an equi-
librium that achieves high location privacy, and reduces the
number of used pseudonyms.
8. LOCATION PRIVACY PROTOCOL
As discussed in Section 4, several mobile nodes can coor-
dinate a pseudonym change with the Swing protocol [43].
In the Swing protocol, any node can start the pseudo-
nym change by broadcasting an initiation message. Usually,
nodes changing speed and/or direction will initiate the pro-
tocol if there is at least another node in proximity. Mobile
nodes receiving the initiation message stop communicating
for a silent period deﬁned in the initiation message and de-
cide whether to change pseudonym.
In the Swing protocol, the decision of mobile nodes (to
cooperate or not) exclusively depends on their user-centric
level of location privacy compared to a ﬁxed threshold. In
other words, the cost of changing pseudonym and the prob-
ability of cooperation of the neighbors are not considered.
Our game-theoretic evaluation allows us to design a more
sophisticated protocol - the PseudoGame protocol - that ex-

mobile nodes in a non-cooperative environment. The Pseu-
doGame protocol is based on our results for n-player I-games
in Section 7.
Similar to [43], we assume that mobile nodes move in the
network with speed in the range [s
¯max]. The nodes
can choose a silent period in the range [spmin, spmax]. The
duration of the silent period is attached to the initiation
message. When a node is expected to change its velocity
within spmax time steps, the node sends the initiation mes-
sage and the PseudoGame protocol is started.
It lasts at
most (spmax + 1) time steps.
¯min, s
All nodes in proximity that receive the initiation message
use the PseudoGame protocol if the authenticity of the initia-
tion message is veriﬁed. Their decision to change pseudonym
is inﬂuenced by the number of neighbors and their probabil-
ity of cooperation (related to the distribution of user types
f (θi)). As described in Protocol 1 for any node i, the Pseu-
doGame protocol assists mobile nodes in selecting the BNE
strategy. In summary, after receiving the initiation message,
the nodes calculate the equilibrium thresholds using their
location privacy level, the estimated number of neighbors,
and their belief f (θi). The PseudoGame protocol extends
the Swing protocol by computing the optimal threshold to
determine when to change pseudonym.

9. CONCLUSION
We have considered the problem of selﬁshness in location
privacy schemes based on pseudonym changes. We have
introduced a user-centric model of location privacy to mea-
sure the evolution of location privacy over time. To evaluate
the strategic behavior of mobile nodes, we have proposed
a game-theoretic model, the pseudonym change game. We
ﬁrst analyze the n-player scenario with complete informa-
tion and obtaine NE strategy proﬁles. Then, using Bayesian
game theory, we investigate the equilibria in the incomplete
information game and derive the equilibrium strategies for
each node.
In other words, we have derived equilibria to
achieve location privacy in a non-cooperative environment.
A particularly interesting result is that when the cost of
pseudonyms is large, selﬁsh nodes care more about the suc-
cessful unfolding of the game and thus improve the achiev-
able location privacy in the system. This work is the ﬁrst
step towards a deeper understanding of the eﬀect of non-
cooperative behavior in location privacy schemes. For future
work, we intend to evaluate our model in realistic mobile
scenarios and measure the achievable location privacy.
