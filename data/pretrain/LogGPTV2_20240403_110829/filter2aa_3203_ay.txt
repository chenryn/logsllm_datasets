### DHCP Server Configuration and Operations

#### Introduction
In a network where multiple DHCP servers are installed and configured, other DHCP servers respond with a `DHCPAck` message. This message contains information that the querying DHCP server uses to locate the Active Directory root domain. The initiating DHCP server then queries Active Directory for a list of authorized DHCP servers and starts the DHCP Server service only if its own address is in the list.

#### BOOTP Support
The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a host configuration protocol developed before DHCP. It allows a diskless host computer to obtain an IPv4 address configuration, the name of a boot file, and the location of a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server from which the computer loads the boot file. The DHCP Server service supports BOOTP clients through the BOOTP Table folder in the console tree of the DHCP snap-in. By default, this folder is hidden, but you can enable it from the General tab in the properties of a DHCP server in the DHCP snap-in. Once enabled, you can add BOOTP image entries specifying the location of boot files and TFTP servers for BOOTP clients.

#### DHCP Server Service Configuration
The configuration of the DHCP Server service includes properties for the DHCP server, scopes, and DHCP options. This service is typically configured using the DHCP snap-in located in the Administrative Tools folder or via `netsh dhcp` commands for local or remote DHCP servers.

##### Properties of the DHCP Server
To modify the properties of a DHCP server running Windows Server 2008, right-click either IPv4 or IPv6 in the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, and select Properties. For Windows Server 2003, right-click the server name in the console tree and select Properties. The properties dialog box includes the following tabs:

- **General**: Enables automatic update of statistics in the server statistics window, specifies the update frequency, enables DHCP audit logging, and displays the BOOTP Table folder.
- **DNS**: Specifies settings for DNS dynamic update.
- **Network Access Protection**: Configures settings for DHCP Network Access Protection (NAP) enforcement (IPv4 properties for Windows Server 2008).
- **Advanced**: Configures server conflict detection, sets paths for the audit log, database, and backup database, and specifies which connections (LAN interfaces) the DHCP Server service listens on for DHCP messages and credentials for DNS dynamic updates.

##### DHCP Scopes
A DHCP scope is a consecutive range of possible IPv4 unicast addresses that DHCP clients on a subnet can use. Scopes define a single physical subnet on your network to which DHCP services are offered. The DHCP Server service also supports multicast scopes.

###### Configuring a DHCP Scope
After installing and starting the DHCP Server service, configure a scope. Each DHCP server requires at least one scope with a pool of IPv4 addresses available for leasing to DHCP clients. Typically, create multiple scopesâ€”one for each subnet for which the DHCP server offers addresses. Exclude manually configured TCP/IP nodes' IPv4 addresses from the scope to avoid duplicate address conflicts.

To create a DHCP scope:
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, right-click the IPv4 node (or the DHCP server for Windows Server 2003), and select New Scope.
2. Follow the instructions in the New Scope Wizard to name the scope, specify the address range, exclusions, lease duration, and activate the scope.

##### Deploying Multiple DHCP Servers
To ensure DHCP clients can lease IPv4 addresses even if a primary DHCP server becomes unavailable, distribute scopes among multiple DHCP servers. For each subnet:
- On the primary DHCP server, create a scope containing approximately 80% of the available IPv4 addresses.
- On the secondary DHCP server, create a scope containing approximately 20% of the available IPv4 addresses.

If the primary DHCP server becomes unavailable, the secondary server can still service DHCP clients on the subnet. Ensure that each scope contains a unique range of IPv4 addresses to prevent overlapping and duplicate address issues.

##### Superscopes
A superscope is an administrative grouping of scopes used to support multiple logical IPv4 subnets on the same physical subnet. To create a superscope:
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, right-click the IPv4 node (or the DHCP server for Windows Server 2003), and select New Superscope.
2. Follow the instructions in the New Superscope Wizard to name the superscope and select the set of previously created scopes to add to the superscope.

##### Options
Options are additional TCP/IP configuration parameters that a DHCP server can assign when offering leases to DHCP clients. Commonly used options include IPv4 addresses for default gateways, DNS servers, DNS domain names, and WINS servers. Options can be managed at the following levels:
- **Server options**: Apply to all scopes defined on a DHCP server.
- **Scope options**: Apply to all DHCP clients within a particular scope.
- **Class options**: Apply only to clients identified as members of a specified vendor or user class.
- **Reservation options**: Apply only to a single reserved client computer.

To configure a scope option:
1. Open the applicable scope in the console tree of the DHCP snap-in.
2. Right-click Scope Options and select Configure Options.
3. Select the check box for the first option, enter the required data, and click OK.
4. Repeat for any other options.

##### Client Reservations
Client reservations ensure that a specified interface of a network node is always allocated the same IPv4 address. To configure a client reservation:
1. Open the applicable scope or superscope in the console tree of the DHCP snap-in.
2. Right-click Reservations and select New Reservation.
3. Enter the required information and click Add.

For fault tolerance, the reservation must exist on at least two DHCP servers. Overlapping scopes should only be used if all addresses in the overlap are client reservations to avoid conflicts.

##### DHCP Options Classes
Options classes allow further management of options provided to DHCP clients. There are two types of options classes:
- **Vendor classes**: Identify the client's vendor type and configuration.
- **User classes**: Define custom classes for specific configurations.

When a client specifies vendor options, the DHCP server verifies the vendor class and returns the appropriate options. If the vendor class is not recognized, the server returns default options.
