in which other DHCP servers are installed and configured. Other DHCP servers on the network respond 
with a DHCPAck message, which contains information that the querying DHCP server uses to locate 
the Active Directory root domain. The starting DHCP server then queries Active Directory for a list of 
authorized DHCP servers and starts the DHCP Server service only if its own address is in the list. 
BOOTP Support 
The bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) is a host configuration protocol that was developed before DHCP to 
allow a diskless host computer to obtain an IPv4 address configuration, the name of a boot file, and the 
location of a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server from which the computer loads the boot file. 
The DHCP Server service supports BOOTP clients through the BOOTP Table folder in the console tree 
of the DHCP snap-in. The display of this folder is disabled by default, but you can enable it from the 
General tab in the properties of a DHCP server in the DHCP snap-in. After you enable the display of 
that folder, you can add BOOTP image entries specifying the location of boot files and TFTP servers for 
BOOTP clients from the BOOTP Table folder.

DHCP Server Service Configuration 
The configuration of the DHCP Server service consists of a set of properties for the DHCP server, 
scopes, and DHCP options. This service is typically configured using the DHCP snap-in located in the 
Administrative Tools folder. You can also use netsh dhcp commands to configure local or remote 
DHCP servers. 
Properties of the DHCP Server 
To modify the properties of a DHCP server running Windows Server 2008, right-click either IPv4 or 
IPv6 in the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, and click Properties. To modify the properties of a 
DHCP server running Windows Server 2003, right-click the name of the server in the console tree of the 
DHCP snap-in, and click Properties. A properties dialog box should appear with the following tabs: 
General 
On the General tab, you can enable the automatic update of statistics in the server statistics 
window of the DHCP snap-in and specify how often the statistics are updated. You can also enable 
DHCP audit logging to record DHCP server activity in a file and enable the display of the BOOTP 
Table folder in the DHCP console tree. 
DNS 
On the DNS tab, you can specify the settings for DNS dynamic update.  
Network Access Protection 
For IPv4 properties for DHCP servers running Windows Server 2008, on the Network Access 
Protection tab, you can specify the settings for DHCP Network Access Protection (NAP) 
enforcement. For more information about NAP, see the NAP Web page. 
Advanced 
On the Advanced tab, you can configure server conflict detection (the DHCP Server service 
attempts to ping each address it intends to offer before sending the DHCPOffer message); 
configure paths for the audit log, database, and backup database; and specify which connections 
(LAN interfaces) on which the DHCP Server service is listening for DHCP messages and 
credentials for DNS dynamic updates.

DHCP Scopes 
A DHCP scope is the consecutive range of possible IPv4 unicast addresses that DHCP clients on a 
subnet can use. Scopes typically define a single physical subnet on your network to which DHCP 
services are offered. Scopes are the primary way for the DHCP server to manage distribution and 
assignment of IPv4 addresses and any related configuration parameters to DHCP clients on the 
network. 
The DHCP Server service also supports multicast scopes.  
Configuring a DHCP Scope 
After you have installed and started the DHCP Server service, your next step is to configure a scope. 
Every DHCP server requires at least one scope with a pool of IPv4 addresses available for leasing to 
DHCP clients. Typically, you create multiple scopes—one for each subnet for which the DHCP is 
offering addresses. 
If a subnet contains manually configured TCP/IP nodes, you should exclude their IPv4 addresses from 
the scope. Otherwise, the DHCP server might allocate an address that is already in use on the subnet, 
causing problems with duplicate addresses. 
To create a DHCP scope, do the following: 
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, right-click the IPv4 node or, for DHCP servers running 
Windows Server 2003, the DHCP server on which you want to configure a scope, and then click New 
scope.  
2. Follow the instructions in the New Scope Wizard. 
The New Scope Wizard guides you through naming the scope; specifying the address range, 
exclusions, and lease duration; configuring DHCP options (default gateway, DNS settings, WINS 
settings); and activating the scope. If you do not activate the scope from the New Scope Wizard, you 
can manually activate it by right-clicking the scope name in the console tree, and then clicking Activate.

Deploying Multiple DHCP Servers 
To ensure that DHCP clients can lease IPv4 addresses even if a DHCP server becomes unavailable, 
you should create multiple scopes for each subnet and distribute them among the DHCP servers in the 
network. As a general rule, you should do the following for each subnet: 
On a DHCP server that is designated the primary DHCP server for the subnet, create a scope 
containing approximately 80 percent of the IPv4 addresses available to DHCP clients. 
On a DHCP server that is designated as the secondary DHCP server for the subnet, create a scope 
containing approximately 20 percent of the  IPv4 addresses available to DHCP clients.  
When the primary DHCP server for a subnet becomes unavailable, the secondary DHCP server can 
still service DHCP clients on the subnet.  
Figure 6-11 shows a simplified example DHCP configuration.  
Figure 6-11  An example of subnet address distribution on multiple DHCP servers 
Server1 has a scope for the local subnet with an IPv4 address range of 131.107.4.20 through 
131.107.4.160, and Server2 has a scope with an IPv4 address range of 131.107.3.20 through 
131.107.3.160. Each server can lease IPv4 addresses to clients on its own subnet. 
Additionally, each server has a scope containing a small range of IPv4 addresses for the other subnet. 
For example, Server1 has a scope for Subnet B with the IPv4 address range of 131.107.3.161 through 
131.107.3.200. Server2 has a scope for Subnet A with the IPv4 address range of 131.107.4.161 
through 131.107.4.200. If a client on Subnet A is unable to lease an address from Server1, it can lease 
an address for its subnet from Server2, and vice versa. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 179 
The primary DHCP server for a subnet does not have to be located on the subnet. In practice, most 
subnets do not contain a DHCP server, but they do contain a DHCP relay agent. For a large network in 
which the DHCP servers are located on network segments containing other servers, the primary DHCP 
server for a given subnet is the DHCP server that is topologically closest to the subnet and contains 
approximately 80 percent of the addresses for the subnet. The secondary DHCP server for a given 
subnet is the DHCP server that is topologically farther from the subnet than the primary DHCP server 
and contains approximately 20 percent of the addresses for the subnet. 
Because DHCP servers do not share scope information, it is important that each scope contain a 
unique range of IPv4 addresses. If the scopes of different DHCP servers contain the same IPv4 
addresses (known as overlapping scopes), multiple servers can lease the same IPv4 addresses to 
different DHCP clients on a subnet, causing problems with duplicate IPv4 addresses. 
Superscopes 
A superscope is an administrative grouping of scopes that you can use to support multiple logical IPv4 
subnets on the same physical subnet. Superscopes contain a list of member scopes that can be 
activated together. You cannot use superscopes to configure other details about scope usage. For 
configuring most properties used within a superscope, you must configure individual properties of 
member scopes. 
By using a superscope, you can support DHCP clients on locally attached or remote networks that have 
multiple logical subnets on one physical network segment (sometimes referred to as a multi-net). 
To create a superscope, do the following:  
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, right-click the IPv4 node or, for DHCP servers running 
Windows Server 2003, the DHCP server on which you want to configure a superscope, and then 
click New superscope. 
2. Follow the instructions in the New Superscope Wizard. 
The New Superscope Wizard guides you through naming the superscope and selecting the set of 
previously created scopes to add to the superscope. 
Options 
Options are other TCP/IP configuration parameters that a DHCP server can assign when offering 
leases to DHCP clients. For example, commonly used options include IPv4 addresses for default 
gateways (routers), DNS servers, DNS domain names, and WINS servers. Options can apply to all the 
scopes configured on the DHCP server or only to a specific scope. Most options are predefined in RFC 
2132, but you can use the DHCP snap-in to define and add custom option types if needed.  
You can manage options at the following levels: 
Server options   
These options apply to all scopes defined on a DHCP server. Server options are available to all 
DHCP clients of the DHCP server. Server options are used when all clients on all subnets require 
the same configuration information. For example, you might want to configure all DHCP clients to 
use the same DNS domain name. Server options are always used, unless overridden by scope, 
class, or reservation options. 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 180 
Scope options   
These options apply to all DHCP clients that obtain a lease within a particular scope. For example, 
each subnet has a different IPv4 address as its default gateway address. Therefore, the option for 
assigning the default gateway must be a scope option. Scope options override global options for 
the same configuration parameter. 
Class options   
These options apply only to clients that are identified as members of a specified vendor or user 
class when obtaining a lease. For more information about vendor and user classes, see "DHCP 
Options Classes" in this chapter. 
Reservation options   
These options apply only to a single reserved client computer and require a reservation to be used 
in an active scope. Reservation options override server and scope options for the same 
configuration parameter. For more information about reservations, see "Client Reservations" in this 
chapter. 
To configure a scope option: 
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, open the IPv4 node or, for DHCP servers running Windows 
Server 2003, the DHCP server on which you want to configure a scope option, and then open the 
applicable scope. 
2. Right-click Scope Options, and then click Configure Options.  
3. In Available Options, select the check box for the first option that you want to configure.  
4. Under Data entry, type the information required for this option, and then click OK.  
5. Repeat the steps 3-4 for any other options you want to specify.  
You can also click the Advanced tab, and specify additional scope options to apply only to members of 
selected user or vendor classes.  
Figure 6-12 shows an example of the configuration of the DNS Servers scope option.

Figure 6-12  An example of configuring the DNS Servers scope option 
Even though a DHCP server running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 can offer all the 
options in the options list, DHCP clients running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008 
and Windows Server 2003 request only the options listed in Table 6-1 during the DHCP configuration 
process. 
Option  
Description

be used by the DHCP client. 
031 Perform Router Discovery 
Specifies whether the DHCP client uses Internet 
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) router discovery as 
a host, as specified in RFC 1256. 
033 Static Route 
Specifies a set of classful IPv4 network destinations 
and their corresponding router IPv4 addresses that

Table 6-1  DHCP options requested by a Windows-based DHCP client 
Windows components can request additional DHCP options by using the DhcpRequestParams() 
function call. For more information, see How to Request Additional DHCP Options from a DHCP 
Server. DHCP clients that are not running Windows can request any DHCP option. 
Client Reservations 
You use a client reservation to ensure that a specified interface of a network node is always allocated 
the same IPv4 address. Some DHCP clients cannot change their IPv4 address configuration. For 
example, servers on a network that contains clients that are not WINS-enabled should always lease the 
same IPv4 address. Clients that are not WINS-enabled must use the Lmhosts file to resolve NetBIOS 
computer names of hosts on remote networks. If the IPv4 address of the server changes because it is 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 182 
not reserved, name resolution using Lmhosts will fail. Reserving an IPv4 address for the server ensures 
that its IPv4 address will remain the same.  
To configure a client reservation: 
1. In the console tree of the DHCP snap-in, open the IPv4 node or, for DHCP servers running Windows 
Server 2003, the DHCP server on which you want to configure a reservation, and then open the 
applicable scope or superscope. 
2. Right-click Reservations, and then click New Reservation.  
3. In New Reservation, type the information required to complete the client reservation.  
4. To add the client reservation to the scope, click Add.  
5. Repeat steps 2-5 for any other client reservations that you want to add, and then click Close.  
Figure 6-13 shows an example of configuring a reservation. 
Figure 6-13  An example of configuring a reservation 
The MAC address field is the most important entry in the reservation dialog box because DHCP clients 
send their MAC addresses in the DHCPDiscover and DHCPRequest messages. If this value is 
incorrectly typed, it will not match the value sent by the DHCP client. As a result, the DHCP server will 
assign the client any available IPv4 address in the scope instead of the IPv4 address reserved for the 
client. To obtain or verify a DHCP client’s MAC address, type ipconfig /all at the command prompt on 
the DHCP client. 
Fault Tolerance for Client Reservations 
To provide fault tolerance for client reservations, the reservation must exist on at least two DHCP 
servers. The client can receive its lease from any DHCP server and will be guaranteed the same IPv4 
address. However, the only way to have the same client reservations on multiple DHCP servers is to 
have overlapping scopes. If any dynamic addresses are allocated from these overlapping scopes, 
addresses will conflict. Therefore, you should not use overlapping scopes unless all of the addresses in 
the overlap of the scopes are client reservations. 
DHCP Options Classes 
An options class is a way for you to further manage options provided to DHCP clients. When you add 
an options class to the DHCP server, it can provide DHCP clients of that class with class-specific option 
Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 183 
types for their configuration. DHCP client computers running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 
Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 can also specify a class ID when they communicate with the 
server. To support earlier DHCP clients that do not support class IDs, you can configure the DHCP 
server with default classes. Options classes can be of two types: vendor classes and user classes.  
Vendor Classes 
DHCP clients can use vendor-defined options classes to identify the client's vendor type and 
configuration to the DHCP server when the client obtains a lease. For a client to identify its vendor class 
during the lease process, the client needs to include the Vendor Class ID option (option code 60) in the 
DHCPDiscover and DHCPRequest messages. 
The vendor class identifier is a string of character data that DHCP servers interpret. Vendors can define 
specific vendor class identifiers to convey particular configuration or other identification information 
about a client. For example, the identifier might encode the client's hardware or software configuration. 
Most vendor types are derived from standard reserved hardware and operating system-type 
abbreviation codes listed in RFC 1700. 
When a client specifies vendor options, the DHCP server performs the following additional steps to 
provide a lease to the client: 
1. The server verifies whether the vendor class identified by the client request is also defined on the 
server.  
2. If the vendor class is defined, the server verifies whether any additional DHCP options are configured 
for this class in the matching scope. 
If the vendor class is not recognized, the server ignores the vendor class identified in the client request, 
and the server returns options allocated to the default vendor class, known as the DHCP Standard 
Options vendor class. If the scope contains options configured specifically for use with clients in this 
vendor-defined class, the server returns those options using the Vendor-specific option type (option 
code 43) in the DHCPAck message.
