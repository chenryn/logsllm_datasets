User: How to deploy and manage multiple servers in batches using Ansible?
Assistant: Ansible is an automation tool that can batch deploy and manage multiple servers. To perform batch deployment and management of multiple servers, the following steps need to be performed: 1. Determine the list of servers to be deployed and managed, and store them in the Inventory file of the Ansible host. 2. Create Ansible Playbooks that define tasks and actions to be performed on multiple servers. 3. Define used modules and plugins in Ansible Playbook to perform tasks and operations. 4. Execute Ansible Playbooks using ansible commands to perform tasks and operations on multiple servers. 5. If you need to manage multiple servers, you can create Ansible Roles to define the tasks and operations that need to be performed, and reuse them in multiple Playbooks. Using Ansible can greatly simplify the task of deploying and managing multiple servers and improve efficiency and accuracy. At the same time, Ansible also provides a wealth of plug-ins and modules to support different operating systems and applications.
