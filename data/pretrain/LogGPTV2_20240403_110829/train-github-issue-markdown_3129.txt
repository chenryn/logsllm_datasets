### Example Code
    @app.post( '/test-fail')
    def test( param1: str = Form(...),	# It fails if the File goes first
              file: bytes = File(...)
            ):
        return Response(content=file, media_type="application/octet-stream")
    @app.post( '/test-success')
    def test( file: bytes = File(...),	# It succeeds if the File goes first 
              param1: str = Form(...)
            ):
        return Response(content=file, media_type="application/octet-stream")
### Description
**BUG**  
The `File` parameter on the POST method must go first, before other `Form`
parameters. Otherwise the end-point returns HTTP code 422.
**Details**  
A command line like below for the end-points from the example
    curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/test' --form 'param1="fff"' --form 'file=@"file.png"'
would return _HTTP code 200_ with an expected result for `/test-success` and
_HTTP code 422_ for `/test-fail` with the following JSON:
    {"detail":[{"loc":["body","file"],"msg":"byte type expected","type":"type_error.bytes"}]}
**Expected behaviour**  
Validation of parameters doesn't depend on the order of the parameters
