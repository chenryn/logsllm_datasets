User: In the Linux system, how to use the rsync tool to realize data synchronization backup?
Assistant: Use the rsync tool to quickly and easily realize synchronous backup of data. The following are the specific steps: 1. Install rsync on the source server Ubuntu/Debian system: sudo apt-get install rsync CentOS/Fedora system: sudo yum install rsync 2. Create a backup directory on the target server such as: sudo mkdir /backup 3. Use rsync for data synchronization backup rsync common parameters: -a: copy files completely, including all metadata of files; -v: display detailed operation information; -r: copy folders recursively; -z: use compression to transfer data; -- delete: delete files that do not exist on the target server; --exclude: exclude specific files or folders. Basic backup with rsync: sudo rsync -avz --delete /var/www/html/ user@<backup server IP>:/backup/html/ This will delete all files and files in the /var/www/html/ directory backup folder to the /backup/html/ directory of <backup server IP>, and delete the deleted files from the target server. Incremental backup using rsync: Incremental backup refers to copying only changed data to reduce data transmission and storage space consumption. sudo rsync -avz --delete --exclude '*.log' /var/www/html/ user@<backup server IP>:/backup/html/ The above command will exclude the . log file, and only transfer the changed data. Note: rsync uses SSH for encrypted data transmission. It is necessary to ensure that the target server has enabled the SSH service, and set firewall rules to allow the corresponding port; in order to avoid permission problems, it is recommended to use root permissions or an account with access permissions to the source server directory for backup operations.
