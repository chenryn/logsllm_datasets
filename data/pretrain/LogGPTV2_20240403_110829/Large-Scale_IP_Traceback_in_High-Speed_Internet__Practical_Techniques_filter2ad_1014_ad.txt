### Simulation Results and Theoretical Analysis

#### Figure 4: Error Level by Varying \( k \)

The following graphs show the performance of the traceback scheme in terms of the combined False Positive Ratio (FPR) and False Negative Ratio (FNR) as a function of the number of hash functions \( k \).

**RPF + RNF (Error Level)**
- **Np = 50,000**
- **Np = 75,000**
- **Np = 100,000**

**Graphs:**
- **(a) Skitter I Topology**
- **(b) Skitter II Topology**
- **(c) Bell-lab’s Topology**

Each graph plots the error level (FPR + FNR) against the number of hash functions \( k \). The results show that the error level decreases as the number of hash functions increases, indicating improved accuracy.

#### Performance Metrics and Control Parameters

**Table 1: Performance Metrics and Control Parameters**

| **Performance Metrics** | **Control Parameters** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **FNR (False Negative Ratio)**: The ratio of the number of missed routers in the constructed attack tree to the number of infected routers. | **Na**: The number of attackers. |
| **FPR (False Positive Ratio)**: The ratio of the number of incorrectly convicted routers to the number of convicted routers in the constructed attack tree. | **Np**: The number of attack packets used for traceback. |
| | **p**: The sampling rate at an intermediate router. |
| | **k**: The number of hash functions in a Bloom filter. |
| | **s**: Resource constraint (= k * p) |

Our traceback scheme demonstrates high accuracy even with a large number of attackers, requiring only a moderate number of attack packets for effective traceback.

#### Simulation Setup: Topologies and Metrics

**Topologies Used:**
1. **Skitter Data I**: Collected from a CAIDA-owned host (a-root.skitter.caida.org) on 11/28/2001, containing traceroute data to 192,900 destinations.
2. **Skitter Data II**: Collected from another CAIDA host (e-root.skitter.caida.org) on 11/27/2001, containing routes to 158,181 destinations.
3. **Bell-lab’s Dataset**: Collected from a Bell-labs host, containing routes to 86,813 destinations. Incomplete paths were trimmed, and six route sets from the same host were merged into one.

In our simulations, the origin is assumed to be the victim, and attackers are randomly distributed among the destination hosts. This assumption simplifies the simulation, though in real scenarios, attackers may cluster in vulnerable networks, which can increase the correlation between routers in the attack path.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **FNR (False Negative Ratio)**: The ratio of undetected routers (false negatives) to the number of actual infected routers.
- **FPR (False Positive Ratio)**: The ratio of incorrectly identified routers (false positives) to the total number of routers in the attack tree.

The ideal traceback scheme should have a low FNR, using a moderate number of attack packets. It is not necessary to achieve a zero FNR, as identifying and removing most attackers is sufficient to restore services. Incomplete or approximate attack path information is still valuable for complementary measures like packet filtering.

**Control Parameters:**
- **Na**: Number of attackers.
- **Np**: Number of attack packets used for traceback.
- **p**: Sampling rate at an intermediate router.
- **k**: Number of hash functions in a Bloom filter.
- **s**: Resource constraint (= k * p).

#### Figure 5: Error Level by Varying \( s \)

The following graphs show the performance of the traceback scheme in terms of the combined FPR and FNR as a function of the resource constraint \( s \) (where \( s = k \times p \)).

**RPF + RNF (Error Level)**
- **k = 8**
- **k = 9**
- **k = 10**
- **k = 11**
- **k = 12**
- **k = 13**
- **k = 14**
- **k = 15**
- **k = 16**

**Graphs:**
- **(a) Skitter I Topology**
- **(b) Skitter II Topology**
- **(c) Bell-lab’s Topology**

Each graph plots the error level (FPR + FNR) against the resource constraint \( s \). The results show that the error level decreases as the resource constraint increases, indicating improved accuracy.

**Number of Attackers:**
- **1000 attackers**
- **2000 attackers**
- **5000 attackers**

These simulations support the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the traceback scheme under various conditions.
