 **Describe the bug**
hi  
my gltf contains a texture transformation for the normals chanel.
      "materials": [
        {
          "name": "Material_0",
          "normalTexture": {
            "extensions": {
              "KHR_texture_transform": {
                "scale": [
                  0.1,
                  0.1
                ]
              }
            },
            "index": 1
          },
the transformation is ignored by Three.js editor  
my normals map contains a white polygon.  
see snapshots from from Three.js (wrong) and khronos viewer (correct)  
normals polygon is marked with red  
after snapshot, I attached the gltf inside a zip file.  
please advise  
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. open https://threejs.org/editor/
  2. import attached rectangle.gltf (extracted from rectangle.zip)
  3. in the scene dialog, double click rectangle.gltf
  4. in the Environment, select MODELVIEWER
  5. ERROR - The normal image should be much larger becase the KHR_texture_transform scale is 0.1
_**Code**_
    // code goes here
_**Live example**_
  * jsfiddle-latest-release
  * jsfiddle-dev
**Expected behavior**  
Since i was using scale transformation for the normal chanel in the material,
i was expecting the normal texture to be much bigger, as viewd in khronos
viewer.
