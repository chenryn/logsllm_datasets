### Network Resource Requirements

For each category, we constructed five traffic matrices, where each request was randomly generated following the OC-n notation. We assumed the number of channels per fiber to be 64 and the capacity of a single lightpath to be OC-192.

In our study, we measured the cost of a heuristic in two ways:
1. The average number of lightpaths required to handle a given set of traffic requests.
2. The average number of channels per fiber used for establishing all the required lightpaths.

A network design is considered successful if all the traffic can be accommodated by the logical topology created by the heuristic. The entries in Table II and Table III represent the average values for all successful experiments. If, for a given network size or traffic condition (i.e., high, medium, or low), all the experiments failed, we have put a “-” for the corresponding entry.

### Comparison of the Number of Wavelength-Links

Table II compares the average number of channels per fiber (rounded up to the nearest integer) required to implement a successful topology using H-STG, shared path protection (H-SP), and dedicated path protection (H-DP). In the table, #Nd indicates the number of nodes in the network. From the table, it can be seen that H-STG outperforms both H-DP and H-SP, with a minimum savings of about 25% (5%) compared to dedicated (shared) protection. On average, dedicated (shared) path protection requires 28% - 48% (10% - 20%) more resources (channels per link) compared to our approach.

### Comparison of the Number of Lightpaths

Table III compares the number of lightpaths used by any path protection scheme to our scheme when designing a robust logical topology capable of handling a given set of traffic requirements. Since both shared path protection and dedicated path protection schemes require the same number of lightpaths, Table III only shows the results for shared path protection. Table III demonstrates that our approach results in a significant reduction in the number of lightpaths, and hence a reduction in transceiver costs (assuming fixed-frequency transmitters and receivers), compared to well-known techniques based on path protection. The average improvement ranges from 22% for a 6-node network up to 41% for a 40-node network. As the size of the network grows, the improvement using our approach over shared and dedicated path protection increases steadily.

Figure 1 shows the average reduction in the number of lightpaths required to implement a feasible topology using our approach, compared to the number of lightpaths required using shared/dedicated protection. There were also many cases where all traffic requests could not be accommodated (given the specified resource constraints) using dedicated/shared path protection, but could be easily handled using H-STG. For example, for the 40-node network with high traffic, none of the traffic matrices could be handled by H-SP or H-DP, but H-STG could successfully accommodate the requests. This is why there is no entry showing percentage improvement in Figure 1 for the high-traffic case in a 40-node network. The experimental results also demonstrate that, as the size of the network increases, the relative performance of our approach improves steadily compared to standard path protection schemes.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we introduced a new approach for survivable traffic grooming in WDM mesh networks. Our main contribution is the integration of the survivable logical topology design and traffic grooming problems, ensuring that when a topology is generated using our approach, it can accommodate all traffic requests for any single link failure. Unlike previous approaches, our scheme does not require "rerouting" of disrupted lightpaths to avoid a failed link; instead, it ensures that the surviving lightpaths can handle all traffic requests. We presented two ILP formulations: the first attempts to accommodate the maximum amount of traffic given the constraints on network resources, while the second designs a network capable of handling all traffic requests with a minimum amount of resources. We showed that the first ILP can be used for practical networks with hundreds of requests, while the second ILP can only be used for small networks. We proposed a fast heuristic for larger networks and compared the network resources required using our heuristic to those required in path protection schemes. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that our approach provides bandwidth guarantees similar to path protection but requires significantly fewer resources.
