For each of the above categories, we constructed ﬁve trafﬁc
matrices, where each request was randomly generated follow-
ing in OC-n notation. We assumed the number of channels
per ﬁber, and the capacity of a single lightpath to be 64 and
OC-192, respectively.
In our study, we measured the cost of a heuristic in two
ways
- the average number of lightpaths required to handle a
given set of trafﬁc requests, and
- the average number of channels per ﬁber used for
establishing all the required lightpaths.
We consider a network design to be successful if all the trafﬁc
can be accommodated by the logical topology that is created
by the heuristic. The entries in Table II and Table III represent
the average values for all successful experiments. If, for a given
network size or for a given trafﬁc condition (i.e. high, medium
or low), all the experiments failed, we have put a “-” for the
corresponding entry.
C. Comparison of the Number of Wavelength-Links
Table II presents a comparison of the average number of
channels per ﬁber (rounded up to the nearest integer) required
to implement a successful topology using H-STG, shared path
protection (H-SP) and dedicated path protection (H-DP). In the
table, #Nd indicates the number of nodes in the network. From
the table, it can be seen that the H-STG clearly outperforms
both H-DP and H-SP with a minimum savings of about 25%
(5%) compared to dedicated (shared) protection. On average,
dedicated (shared) path protection requires 28% - 48% (10%
- 20%) more resources (channels per link), compared to our
approach.
D. Comparison of the Number of lightpaths
In Table III, we compare the number of lightpaths used by
any path protection scheme to our scheme when designing a
robust logical topology capable of handling a given set of
trafﬁc requirements. Since both shared path protection and
dedicated path protection schemes require the same number
of lightpaths, Table III only shows the results for shared path
protection. Table III demonstrates that our approach results in
a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of lightpaths, and hence a
reduction in transceiver costs (assuming ﬁxed-frequency trans-
mitters and receivers), compared to the well-known techniques
based on path protection. The average improvement ranges
from 22% for a 6-node network up to 41% for a 40-node
network. As the size of the network grows, the improvement
using our approach over shared and dedicated path protection
increases steadily.
Fig. 1 shows the average reduction in the number of
lightpaths required to implement a feasible topology using
our approach, compared to the number of lightpaths required
using shared/dedicated protection. There were also many cases
where all trafﬁc requests could not be accommodated (given
the speciﬁed resource constraints) using dedicated/shared path
protection, but could be easily handled using H-STG. For
example, for the 40-node network with high trafﬁc, none of
the trafﬁc matrices could be handled by H-SP or H-DP, but
H-STG could successfully accommodate the requests. This is
why there is no entry showing percentage improvement in
Fig. 1 for the high-trafﬁc case in a 40-node network. The
experimental results also demonstrate that, as the size of the
network increases, the relative performance of our approach
improves steadily as compared to standard path protection
schemes.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have introduced a new approach for
survivable trafﬁc grooming in WDM mesh networks. Our
main contribution is that we integrate the survivable logical
topology design and trafﬁc grooming problems, so that when
a topology is generated using our approach, it is guaranteed
to be able to accommodate all trafﬁc requests for any single
link failure. Unlike previous approaches, our scheme does not
require “rerouting” of disrupted lightpaths to avoid a failed
link; instead it ensures that the surviving lightpaths can handle
all trafﬁc requests. We have presented two ILP formulations -
the ﬁrst formulation attempts to accommodate the maximum
amount of trafﬁc, given the constraints on network resources,
while the second designs a network capable of handling all
trafﬁc requests with a minimum amount of resources. We have
shown that the ﬁrst ILP can be used for practical networks
with hundreds of requests. The second ILP can only be used
for small networks and we have proposed a fast heuristic for

Percentage improvement in number of lightpaths using H-STG,
larger networks. We have compared the network resources
required using our heuristic to the resources required in path
protection schemes. Experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our approach provides bandwidth guarantees, similar to
path protection, but requires signiﬁcantly fewer resources.
