User: Please analyze the reason why the query speed of the database containing 100,000 records is slow, and provide optimization suggestions.
Assistant: There are many possible reasons: 1. The database schema design is unreasonable, resulting in the query needing to scan a large amount of data. 2. The database index is poor or lacks index, which causes the query to perform a full table scan. 3. Insufficient performance of the database server, causing queries to take longer to process. 4. The query statement contains too many complex structures such as associated tables and subqueries, which greatly prolongs the query time. Optimization suggestions: 1. Optimize the database mode, adopt reasonable table structure design, index, partition and other methods to make the query more efficient. 2. Design indexes according to query requirements, give priority to ensuring the indexes of primary keys, unique keys, and foreign keys, and consider adding indexes for other commonly used columns in queries. 3. To optimize the bottleneck of the database server, you can consider increasing the CPU core, memory, hard disk capacity, etc. to improve the processing capacity. 4. Reduce unnecessary complex structures such as associations and subqueries in query statements to avoid unnecessary performance loss. 5. Pre-calculate some data with complex calculations as much as possible, and cache them, and directly use the results in the cache when querying, to avoid repeated calculations during querying. 6. Perform redundant storage for frequently queried data, avoiding the need for cross-table queries when querying.
