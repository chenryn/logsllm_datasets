To mitigate file system permission abuse, it is recommended to use auditing tools that can identify and address such vulnerabilities within an enterprise environment. For example, the PowerSploit framework includes the PowerUp module, which can be utilized to detect service-related file system permission weaknesses on systems.[3] 

By regularly conducting these audits and promptly correcting any identified issues, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or exploitation.
