User: need help with something...
I had this python program which i made. 
The thing is, i need the source of it, but the thing is, the hdd i had with it is dead
, and when i tried to lookup any backups, it wasn't there.
The only thing i have the binary, which i think, was compiled in cx_Freeze. I'm really desperate about it, and i tried any avialble ways to do it, and there was none or almost little.
Is there a way to ''unfreeze'' the executable or at least get the pyc out of it?
Assistant: No, it is not possible to recover the original source code.
If the application used CPython, though, it is always possible to recover the CPython bytecode, which you can use a disassembler on to make a reconstruction of the Python code, but a lot of information will be lost; the resulting code will look rather unreadable and obfuscated, depending on the degree to which the bytecode was optimised.
If you want to go down that path, though, I advise looking into CPython's "dis" module.  There are also numerous other utilities available that can reconstruct Python code from CPython bytecode.
