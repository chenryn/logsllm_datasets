**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To enhance security and mitigate the risk of privilege escalation, restrict user account privileges so that only authorized administrators can create scheduled tasks on remote systems. In Linux environments, you can manage user-level access to the `at` command using the `at.allow` and `at.deny` files. Users listed in the `at.allow` file are permitted to schedule tasks using the `at` command, while users listed in the `at.deny` file are prohibited from using this utility.

### Recommendations:
- **Restrict Access:** Ensure that only necessary and authorized administrative accounts have the ability to create scheduled tasks.
- **Use `at.allow` and `at.deny` Files:**
  - **`at.allow` File:** List the usernames of users who are allowed to use the `at` command.
  - **`at.deny` File:** List the usernames of users who are not allowed to use the `at` command. If the `at.allow` file is present, the `at.deny` file is ignored.
- **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and update these files to ensure that access controls remain up-to-date and aligned with organizational policies.

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage user account privileges and reduce the risk of unauthorized actions.
