User: What is CI/CD? How to implement CI/CD process?
Assistant: CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is an approach to software development, testing, and deployment that aims to achieve continuous delivery of software. The main steps of the CI/CD process are as follows: 1. Code management: Use a version control system to centrally manage code. 2. Continuous Integration (CI): Build, compile, test and find problems in real time. Every time the team submits code, it will automatically execute a series of tests to ensure the stability and correctness of the code. 3. Continuous delivery (CD): During the development process, the functions and features that the team has completed are continuously delivered so that they can receive user feedback as early as possible. 4. Automated testing: In the process of continuous delivery, use automated testing to ensure that the final delivery is a reliable function. 5. Deployment automation: After the continuous integration is completed, the new version is automatically deployed, and the code is deployed to the operating environment. 6. Visual monitoring: Use tools such as dashboards, indicators, alarms, and logs to provide real-time monitoring of the production environment, and to track and investigate the system. In practice, implementing a CI/CD process requires: 1. Introducing tools and platforms: Choosing tools and platforms that match the needs of the team can improve the quality and efficiency of the delivery process. 2. Refactoring framework and architecture: Continuous delivery requires an elastic infrastructure that can easily expand functions, automate and manage continuous delivery. 3. Modification of team culture: CI/CD implementation requires a highly supportive development team able to work closely together during integration and delivery.
