User: I wrote a program in IDLE to tokenize text files and it starts to tokeniza 349 text files! How can I stop it? How can I stop a running Python program?
Assistant: Windows solution: Control  + C.
Macbook solution: Control (^)  + C.
Another way is to open a terminal, type top, write down the PID of the process that you would like to kill and then type on the terminal: kill -9 <pid>
