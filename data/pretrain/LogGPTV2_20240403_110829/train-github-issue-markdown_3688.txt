# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

It would be beneficial to implement the functionality for `Ctrl + Tab` and `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` to cycle through tabs in the most recently used (MRU) order. This feature is commonly available in most tabbed applications, with the notable exception of Chrome. Ideally, this behavior should be enabled by default, but at a minimum, it should be an optional setting.

### Example Behavior
- Suppose you have three tabs open, labeled as Tab 0, Tab 1, and Tab 2.
- If you switch from Tab 0 to Tab 2 and then back to Tab 0, pressing `Ctrl + Tab` should take you to Tab 2.
- Pressing `Ctrl + Tab` again should return you to Tab 0.
- Holding `Ctrl` and pressing `Tab` twice should focus Tab 1.
- Using `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` should switch to the last (oldest) focused tab currently open.

(Note: This assumes zero-based indexing of tabs, as documented in the `profiles.json` file.)

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

A circularly linked list could be an appropriate data structure to manage the MRU order of the tabs. Each node in the list would represent a tab, and the list would maintain the order based on the most recent usage. When a tab is focused, it can be moved to the front of the list, and the `Ctrl + Tab` and `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` key combinations can traverse the list accordingly.
