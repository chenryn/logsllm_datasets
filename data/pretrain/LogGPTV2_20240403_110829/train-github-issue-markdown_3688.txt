# Description of the new feature/enhancement
It would be nice to have the ctrl + tab and ctrl + shift + tab to cycle
through most recently used (MRU) order. This option is available in almost all
tabbed based products (except Chrome :( ). At the very least it is an option
that can be enabled if not already the default behavior.
If I have three tabs open and focus tab 2 then tab 0, pressing ctrl + tab
should take me to tab 2. Pressing it again should take me back to tab 0.
Holding ctrl and pressing tab twice should focus tab 1. (This is all assuming
zero-based indexing of tabs as documented in the profiles.json file) Using the
ctrl + shift + tab should focus the last (oldest) focused tab currently open.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I would imagine a circularly linked list may be appropriate.
