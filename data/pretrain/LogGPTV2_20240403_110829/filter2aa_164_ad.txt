The Raspberry Pi Foundation decided to stack the memory IC on top of the Broadcom SoC to save space on the board, a decision that has proven effective.

### Processor
The processor is the computational heart of any computer system. The Raspberry Pi features an ARM11 processor running at a base speed of 700 megahertz (MHz). This means that, in theory, the Pi can execute 700 million instructions per second, although some instructions may require multiple clock cycles.

Specifically, the ARM chip uses the ARMv6 instruction set. Some advanced hardware enthusiasts have criticized the Pi for not supporting the more recent ARMv7 architecture, which is found in other ARM-based devices like the BeagleBone. However, the ARMv6 architecture provides sufficient computing power for general-purpose applications.

The primary difference between ARMv6 and ARMv7 is that the latter is faster, even at the same clock speed. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi's ARMv6 architecture limits the software it can run, as it cannot execute programs designed for ARMv7 or x86 architectures, such as those for Windows or Mac.

### Broadcom BCM2835
The Broadcom BCM2835 System on Chip (SoC) not only includes the ARM central processing core but also an onboard video processor, the VideoCore IV GPU. This dual-core design allows the SoC to handle both general-purpose computations and video graphics display. The VideoCore IV is particularly impressive, as it can decode and play full 1080p high-definition (HD) video using the H.264 codec, an industry standard.

In Chapter 18, "Raspberry Pi Overclocking," you will learn how to adjust the memory split between system memory and graphics memory, optimizing the Pi for specific applications and uses.

### Hidden Costs of Owning a Raspberry Pi
While the Raspberry Pi itself is available for $25 or $35, additional hardware is required to get it up and running. Here is a list of the essential components:

- **Micro USB Power Supply**
- **SD Card**
- **Powered USB Hub**
- **Ethernet Cable**
- **Monitor**
- **Video Cable**
- **Audio Cable**
- **USB Keyboard and Mouse**

The keyboard, mouse, and monitor are optional if you plan to run the Raspberry Pi headlessly, a setup covered in Chapter 7, "Networking Raspberry Pi."

### Detailed Hardware Requirements

#### 5V Power Supply
The Raspberry Pi requires an input voltage of 5 volts (V) Â±5% according to the USB 2.0 standard. The power requirements differ based on the model:
- **Model B:** 700 milliamps (mA) at 3.5 watts (W)
- **Model A:** 500 mA at 2.5 W

**Note:** Model A is more power-efficient, making it ideal for low-power projects. The lower power consumption is primarily due to the absence of the SMSC LAN9512 Ethernet controller, which consumes significant power. Adding a USB Wi-Fi dongle will increase power consumption.

The power port on the Raspberry Pi is a Micro USB B-style interface, requiring a power supply with a standard USB A connector on one end and a Micro USB B connector on the other. The internal voltage regulator and C6 capacitor step down the incoming 5V to 3.3V, ensuring smooth and steady power.

**Important:** Use reliable, name-brand power supplies to avoid issues with voltage instability, which can damage the board.

#### SD Card
The Raspberry Pi uses a Secure Digital (SD) card for storage, as it lacks onboard data storage. Key considerations when choosing an SD card include:
- **Standard SD Card** (Mini or Micro SD cards can be used with an adapter)
- **Brand Name Product** (e.g., Kingston, Transcend, SanDisk)
- **Capacity of at least 4 GB**
- **Class 4 or higher** (Class 4: 4MB/sec, Class 6: 6MB/sec, Class 10: 10MB/sec)

#### Powered USB Hub
Despite having two USB ports, a powered USB hub is essential for expanding the Pi's functionality. It ensures that USB peripherals receive adequate power, preventing the Pi from being overloaded.

#### Ethernet Cable
For internet connectivity, a Category 5e or 6 Ethernet cable is needed. The Model B board includes an onboard RJ-45 Ethernet jack. For Model A, a USB wired Ethernet adapter is required.

#### Monitor
A spare monitor or television can be used with the Raspberry Pi. The preferred method is via the HDMI port, which supports both video and audio. Older TVs can be connected using an RCA video cable, but this does not support audio. An HDMI-to-DVI-D converter can be used for DVI-equipped monitors, but this will not carry audio.

#### Cables
Depending on your display, you may need an analog RCA video cable or a digital HDMI cable. If using an RCA cable, a 3.5mm stereo audio cable is also required for audio output.

#### USB Keyboard and Mouse
These can be directly connected to the USB ports on the Model B board, but a powered USB hub is recommended for additional expandability.

### Board Tour: Model B
#### Networking
The cube-shaped module on the Model B is the onboard RJ-45 Ethernet interface, limited to 10 or 100 Mbps due to the USB 2.0 standard.

#### Video and Audio
The HDMI port is the preferred method for video and audio, supporting full HD 1920x1080 resolution. For older monitors, an HDMI-to-DVI-D converter can be used, but this will not carry audio. The 3.5 mm stereo audio jack is available for analog audio output.

#### Storage
The SD card slot is located underneath the PCB. The 512MB RAM chip is stacked on top of the SoC, while the Model A has a 256MB RAM chip.

#### Power/Status Information
The Micro USB power port provides 5V DC, which is regulated to 3.3V internally. The status LEDs (ACT, PWR, FDX, LNK, 100) provide at-a-glance information about the board's status.

#### Camera
The Model B includes a MIPI Camera Serial Interface (CSI) connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module, which features a 5-megapixel sensor capable of capturing 2592x1944 still images and 1080p/30 fps video.

### Conclusion
Understanding the components and requirements of the Raspberry Pi is crucial for setting it up and using it effectively. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a smooth and efficient experience with your Raspberry Pi.
