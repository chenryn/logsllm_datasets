@rillian and @evanmcc have both encountered a build failure -- same place --
stage1 segfaults when building optimized on atom. Seems independent of
distribution, (happens on FC17 and Ubuntu oneiric). Both machines were atoms.
Tried builds on emulated non-atoms, same distros, no fault. Think it's atom-
specific. Might be a duplicate of #1879 (requirement for subtargets).
