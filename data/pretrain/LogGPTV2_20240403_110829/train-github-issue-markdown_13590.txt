# Description
I've tried finding resources regarding to this but they seem outdated.  
The problem is that I am trying to build in visual studio with the binaries I
downloaded from
`https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu102/libtorch-win-shared-with-deps-
debug-1.5.0.zip`
I have set the following properties in Visual Studio 2019
  1. Additional include directories : `libtorch\include` ; `libtorch\include\torch\csrc\api\include\`
  2. Additional Library Directory for linker : `\libtorch\lib\`
  3. Conformance mode to No
  4. Linker input : `torch.lib;c10.lib`  
However the resources are also suggesting libs like `caffe2_nvrtc.lib` and
`caffe2.lib` but they are not present in `\libtorch\lib\`
I tried to run the following program
    #include
    #include
    int main()
    {
    	torch::Tensor tensor = torch::eye(3);
    	std::cout << tensor << std::endl;
    }
I got series of errors and warnings :
