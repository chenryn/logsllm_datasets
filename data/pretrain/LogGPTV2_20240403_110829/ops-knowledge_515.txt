User: I have to write a Python script on Windows (using win32 api), executed with system privileges. I need to impersonate the currently logged user to show him a popup (because system user can't). 
So, I'm searching a way to do this operation. I find this method:
win32security.ImpersonateLoggedOnUser
but requires a handle that can be obtained with this method:
win32security.LogonUser
The last method however requires the user password, but I haven't. There is a way to get this handler (or another way to impersonate the currently logged user, or another way to show a popup from system user) without the user password? I'm the system user, so I have full privileges on the machine...
Thanks a lot and sorry for my bad english!

Assistant: Your script must be running as a service. I believe since Windows Vista you must have a separate app in the user session for the GUI.
