**Subject: Impersonating the Currently Logged-On User to Show a Popup in a Python Script**

Hello,

I am working on a Python script that needs to be executed with system privileges on a Windows machine using the `win32api`. My goal is to display a popup message to the currently logged-on user. However, since the system user cannot directly show UI elements, I need to impersonate the logged-on user to achieve this.

I have found the `win32security.ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` method, which requires a handle to the user token. This handle can be obtained using the `win32security.LogonUser` method. Unfortunately, `LogonUser` requires the user's password, which I do not have.

Is there a way to obtain the necessary handle (or another method to impersonate the currently logged-on user) without needing the user's password? As the system user, I have full administrative privileges on the machine.

Additionally, I understand that if my script is running as a service, it might be necessary to have a separate application running in the user session to display the GUI, especially on Windows Vista and later versions.

Thank you very much for your help!

Best regards,
Federico

This version is more structured and clearly explains your requirements and constraints. It also includes the additional information about running the script as a service and the potential need for a separate application to display the GUI.
