**How to Remove Specific Events from the Event Log in Windows Server 2008**

The original poster's question is valid. One of the most significant challenges in logging, error reporting, and alerting is the issue of "white noise." When too many low-priority or irrelevant errors are reported, administrators often start ignoring all errors, which can be problematic.

One of the events mentioned (I believe it is Event ID 1111) indicates that a printer is mapped with a driver that is not available on the server to which you are connected. In most cases, this event is not a concern and does not require any action.

To filter out specific events, such as Event ID 1111, and create a custom view in the Event Viewer, follow these steps:

1. **Open Event Viewer:**
   - Navigate to the Event Viewer and select the log you want to filter (e.g., Application, System, Security).

2. **Filter the Current Log:**
   - In the Actions pane on the right, click on "Filter Current Log."

3. **Configure the Filter:**
   - In the dialog box that appears, scroll down to the "Event IDs" section.
   - Replace the default text "<All Event IDs>" with your desired filter criteria.
     - To include specific events, enter their Event IDs separated by commas (e.g., `1001, 1002`).
     - To exclude specific events, use a minus sign before the Event ID (e.g., `-1111`).

4. **Save the Custom View:**
   - Click "OK" to apply the filter.
   - In the Actions pane, click "Save Filter to Custom View."
   - Name your custom view and save it.

Now, when you need to review the event log, you can use your custom view to focus only on the events that are relevant to you.

While this post comes late to a closed thread, I hope it provides useful information for others who may be searching for a solution to this common issue. It's important to have a clean and meaningful event log to ensure that critical issues are not overlooked.
