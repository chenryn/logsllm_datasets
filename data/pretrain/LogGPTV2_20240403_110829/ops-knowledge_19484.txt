User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I remove specific events from the event log in Windows Server 2008? Do I need a third party tool for this?

Assistant: The OP's post is valid.  The number one problem with logging, error reporting, and alerting is white noise.  When too many "errors" are reported and most of them are low priority or of no concern at all, administrators tend to ignore ALL errors.  Good or bad, this is just a fact of life.  

One of the errors he is talking about is (I think) event ID 1111.  It simply means that you have a printer mapped with a driver that is not available on the server to which you are connected.  It is an error of no concern in most cases ... there is nothing to "fix" as it is not a problem.

If you want to find actual problems and you have specific event ID's that you don't care to weed through, create a custom view with the following steps:


In your event log click on
"Filter Current Log" in the action
pane.
About half way down the dialog box
that pops up, you will find a text
box with &lt;All Event IDs&gt;
Replace this text with your filter
needs.


If you want only a certain
event, put that event ID in there. 
If you have multiples, use commas to
separate.  
If you wish to exclude,
use a minus sign.
In this case we
would use "-1111"  (without the
quotes of course).

Click "OK" on the dialog box.
In the action pane you now click
"Save Filter to Custom View".


Now when you wish to look at your event log, use your custom view and only the information you are truly concerned with will be displayed.

I know that this is a late post to a dead thread but hopefully it helps someone else who is Googling this more than posts of "[Working as intended, n00b!]"   ;-)
