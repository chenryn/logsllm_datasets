### Expected Behavior
The webview 'console-message' event doesn't have an 'args'
https://electronjs.org/docs/api/webview-tag#event-console-message
If you want to listen to what's happening in a webview you can only get the
message.
For example if you do:
    log.info("hello: ", "electron"); 
You can only get 'hello: ' not the "electron" string because there isn't an
args.
This makes it very very difficult to debug what's happening in a webview.
Normally what I do is forward the console message from the child webview to
the parent console so I can see what's happening there but I can't get 'args'
which really breaks things.
I can fix my own code but I can't fix the code of others.
