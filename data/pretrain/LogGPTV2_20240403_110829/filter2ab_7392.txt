titleblackhat:asia-20 Making an Impact from India to the Rest of the World by Building and Nurturing Women Infosec Community
India is one of the most diverse and fastest growing countries in the world and due to the fast growth, women often are left behind. The world average female literacy rate is 79.7%, while in India the average rate is just 65.46%, the women that enter the technology workforce is even lesser and to cyber security is further less. The talk is about the journey of InfoSecGirls community which started in India with the goal of bringing more women into the cyber security workforce and integrating  them with the larger community and is now reaching a global audience. The Initiative was conceptualised because of a need to have a warm and nurturing environment for women where they can easily discuss information security and over a period of time moulded to help women, students, kids, underprivileged communities to come forward and be part of cyber security ecosystem.
In the talk, I will share how we started, the challenges encountered on the way, what we have achieved so far, and  the learnings from our journey. I will also talk about the free technical training we provide at conferences or colleges and how these trainings have enabled individuals start their Infosec journey or make themselves better and more confident in their roles. 
I will also share a framework which will enable interested individuals or groups in their journey towards building and nurturing  communities, and how to enable a culture of knowledge sharing, contributions from members and expand the community for bigger impact.
