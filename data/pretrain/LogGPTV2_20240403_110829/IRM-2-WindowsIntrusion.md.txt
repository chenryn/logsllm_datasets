INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

OBJECTIVE: RESTORE THE SYSTEM TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.
No matter how farthe hacker has advanced into the system and the knowledge you mighthave obtain
about the compromise, as long as the system has been breached, the best practice is to reinstall the
