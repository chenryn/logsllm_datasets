**ATT&CK ID:** T1102.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Bidirectional Communication

Adversaries may exploit legitimate, external web services to establish bidirectional communication channels for command and control (C2) activities. This technique involves using such web services to both send commands to and receive output from a compromised system. Infected systems can leverage popular websites and social media platforms to host C2 instructions. The compromised system can then transmit the results of these commands back through the same web service channel.

The method of returning data to the adversary can vary depending on the specific web service being used. For example:
- Posting a comment on a forum
- Issuing a pull request in a development project
- Updating a document hosted on a web service
- Sending a tweet

This approach allows adversaries to blend their C2 traffic with legitimate user activity, making detection more challenging.
