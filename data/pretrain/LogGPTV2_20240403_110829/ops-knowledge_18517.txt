Question: "An organization implements a policy where every high-level decision must be approved by a committee of seven members to prevent unilateral actions. However, this has slowed down the decision-making process significantly. Select the most valid counterargument to the belief that more approvers inherently lead to better security as per the 'Separation of responsibility' principle."
 "A": "Having multiple approvers can introduce complexity and slow down processes without necessarily increasing security if all members are not fully accountable."
 "B": "The committee members might develop a groupthink mentality, which could lead to faster decision-making but not necessarily better security decisions."
 "C": "A single, well-trained and trustworthy individual can make decisions more quickly and with as much security as a committee."
 "D": "The security of decisions is not related to the number of approvers but rather to the robustness of the security systems in place."
Answer: A
