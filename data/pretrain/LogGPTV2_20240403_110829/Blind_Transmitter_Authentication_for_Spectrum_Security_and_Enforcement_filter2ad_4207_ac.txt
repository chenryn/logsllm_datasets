5. ANALYSIS
In this section, we evaluate FEAT using Matlab-based
simulation results. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the error perfor-
mance of the authentication signal when Dave is the receiver.
We also discuss security issues relevant to FEAT.

5.1 Error Performance
To analyze the error performance of the authentication
signal in FEAT, we assume that perfect symbol and frame
synchronization have been achieved by Dave. An error in
the authentication symbol means (cid:98)ak (cid:54)= ak which occurs
when the mapping of estimated EFO, (cid:98)fk, to the closest
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:98)fk − fk
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) > fa
one among {fm}, for m = 1, 2··· M , leads to a diﬀerent
EFO as compared to the transmitted EFO, fk. This hap-
pens when the error in the estimate of the EFO exceeds the
magnitude of half of the diﬀerence between two consecutive
M−1 . Theoretically, the mean square
EFOs, i.e.,
error (MSE) of the estimate of (cid:98)fk is lower bounded by the
CRLB of the estimate of (cid:98)fk in FEAT as
(cid:19)
Cramer-Rao Lower-Bound (CRLB) [4, 6]. We obtain the

present the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimate
of (cid:98)fk at diﬀerent SNRs. Note that the simulated RMSE
in FEAT is quite close to its theoretical bound given by
square-root of the CRLB. The RMSE vs. SNR curve helps
to estimate the error performance of ASd at a particular
SNR given the speciﬁc values of diﬀerent parameters (pre-
sented in equation (4)). For instance, in Figure 4, RMSE
of the estimate of (cid:98)fk at SNR of −6 dB is 2 kHz. Hence, in
estimate (cid:98)fk is non-Gaussian in nature, we analyze the eﬀect
this example, we can estimate the error performance of ASd
when fa = 5 kHz and M = 2. However, since the frequency
of diﬀerent parameters on the error performance of the au-
thentication signal through simulation where the sampling
frequency Fs is chosen to be 5 MHz [26].
Eﬀect of ρ: In Figure 5a, when we observe the curve
with fa = 5 kHz and M = 2, we note that FEAT is quite
robust against noise, and the error performance improves
(i.e., BER decreases) signiﬁcantly with increase in SNR, e.g.,
BER ≈ 0.03 at SNR = −8, and BER ≈ 0.003 at SNR = −6.
This is because each frame of the message signal contains a
large number of samples (Ns·No) which are used to estimate
one symbol of the authentication signal.
Eﬀect of fa: As the largest possible value of EFO, fa, is
increased, BER of ASd decreases as observed in Figure 5a.
This is because by increasing EFO, we eﬀectively account
for a larger margin of error in (cid:98)fk. However, there are some
limitations on the value of fa as discussed in Appendix C).
Eﬀect of M : While FEAT with M = 2 can carry only
1 authentication bit per frame of the message signal, but
FEAT with M = 4 can carry 2 authentication bits per frame
of the message signal. This means that the authentication
rate (deﬁned in Section 3.2) is increased by increasing M .
However, as shown in Figure 5a, as M increase, the BER
of ASd increases signiﬁcantly. This means that M leads to
a trade-oﬀ between the error performance and the authen-
tication rate of ASd. This trade-oﬀ may play an important
role in the cases where the size of data to be communicated
between the transmitter and the intended receivers, is small.
In order to authenticate Eve, Dave should receive all the
bits from at least one complete authentication sequence.
Note that in order to verify the authentication signal, at
least one complete authentication sequence should be re-
ceived by Dave. This means that the estimated number
of frames of received signal (cid:98)Kr should be greater than the
(cid:98)Kr ≥ Ka. This means that for FEAT with M = 2, the
length of one complete authentication sequence, Ka, i.e.,
number of frames transmitted by Eve should be more than
the length of one authentication sequence which is Ka. How-
ever, when the size of data is small, the number of frames
being transmitted can be signiﬁcantly small. Hence, the au-
thentication rate needs to be increased at the cost of the
error performance to ensure embedding of the authentica-
tion bits of at least one authentication sequence. This will
allow the transmitter to be authenticated for all its trans-
mission including the burst mode.
Eﬀect of Nf and Nc: In Figure 5b, we observe that the
BER decreases by increasing Nf and Nc. Recall that Nc
(CP size) is the number of samples in each OFDM symbol
which are correlated with their corresponding data samples
for frequency estimation. This implies that with the increase
in Nc, the estimation error in frequency decreases leading to
the decrease in BER of ASd.
Eﬀect of Ns: In Figure 5b, we observe that increasing Ns
(frame size) leads to an improvement in error performance,
i.e., we achieve lower BER of ASd. However, larger frame
size also leads to lower frame rate which results into lower
authentication rate. Hence, we again observe a trade-oﬀ
between the authentication rate and the error performance
of ASd in terms of Ns. We also observe that when the
total number of CP samples in a frame given by Nc · Ns
(used for correlation to estimate an authentication symbol)

ASd remains the same.
Moreover, the value of Ns leads to another trade-oﬀ be-
tween the authentication rate and the transparency, which
is one of the main issues that we address through FEAT.
We need to use the unit for transmitting one authentication
symbol as a frame since we aim to embed the authentication
in an absolute transparent manner. In other word, FEAT al-
lows for the presence of unaware receivers (those who do not
know about FEAT) in the network, e.g., Charlie. However,
if the network environment does not require the condition
of absolute transparency (i.e., the network does not have
an unaware receiver), we could embed a frequency oﬀset in
any number (as low as 1) of OFDM symbols. However, as
shown in Figure 5b, decreasing the number of symbols for
frequency estimation signiﬁcantly reduces the error perfor-
mance. Hence, we can achieve an absolute transparency and
high robustness to noise at low authentication rate for ASd
through FEAT, but the approach used in FEAT can also be
utilized to achieve any feasible level of the error performance
and the authentication rate of ASd at cost of transparency.
5.2 Security and Robustness of FEAT
In addition to the strength of the cryptographic primi-
tives used to create the authentication signal, the security
of a BTA scheme also depends on the contents of the au-
thentication signal and the embedding scheme (i.e., method
for embedding the authentication signal into the message
signal). We discuss these security issues in the context of
FEAT in the following paragraphs.
Privacy: We ensure that Alice’s privacy is protected by
employing the privacy preserving group signature scheme
proposed in [3]. When this scheme is used, Eve or Bob
can verify the authenticity of Alice’s authentication signal,
but more importantly Eve cannot discover Alice’s identity
through the authentication process. However, the scheme
does allow Dave (the regulator) to extract Alice’s identity.
Hardware integrity: We assume that tamper resistance
techniques are employed to prevent hackers from circum-
venting the authentication signal embedding mechanism. The
tamper-resistant hardware detects any attempt to alter the
embedding process [24]. Moreover, before embedding the
authentication signal, it ensures that there is no frequency
oﬀset present in the message signal. This means that se-
lective addition/removal of the authentication signal is not
possible.
Integrity of the Authentication Signal: As men-
tioned previously, the authentication signal is made up of
authentication sequences, and each authentication sequence
includes a digital signature. The digital signature ensures
the integrity of the authentication signal.
Robustness to Impersonation Attack: In a successful
impersonation attack, Eve should be able to create proofs
of authenticity for her messages to trick Bob and Dave into
thinking that those messages have been created by Alice.
Additionally, in the case of spectrum sharing, Eve may at-
tempt to perform location, time, and frequency spooﬁng in
order to gain unauthorized access to spectrum. Therefore,
the authentication signal has to be designed to make such
exploits infeasible. FEAT ensures that such an attack is
readily detected because the authentication signal includes
the information about authorized location L, time-frame T ,

and frequency F along with the certiﬁcate C containing the
identity of the transmitter.
Robustness to Replay Attack: To launch replay at-
tacks, Eve needs to store and re-transmit authentication
signals previously transmitted by Alice. However, such re-
played transmissions can be readily detected by Bob and
Dave since the authentication signal contains a time-stamp
T S that cannot be tampered without being detected.
Successful Transmission of the Authentication Sig-
nal: We consider the transmission to be successfully au-
thenticated if the transmitted signal contains at least one
authentication sequence. Due to the low authentication rate
in FEAT, Dave may be unable to authenticate Alice’s trans-
mission if the transmitted message signal does not contain
enough number of frames to embed a complete authentica-
tion sequence. Therefore, it is imperative to utilize a short
digital signature so that the authentication sequence will
be short. For this reason, FEAT utilizes a Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC) based signature scheme instead of a
conventional digital signature scheme (such as RSA-based
signatures) [18].
It is well known that ECC-based cryp-
tosystems can provide an equivalent level of security with a
much shorter key when compared with conventional cryp-
tosystems. For instance, ECC with a key size of 163 bits
provides an equivalent level of security to the signature when
compared with RSA with a key size of 1024.
Robustness to Interference: Eve may also attempt
to corrupt Alice’s authentication signal through selectively
jamming the authentication signal. This type of attack,
called obstruction of authentication (OOA) jamming [17],
may remain undetected if the transmission power required
by Eve to corrupt the authentication signal is small as in the
case of PHY-layer authentication schemes based on hierar-
chical modulation [25]. In these schemes, the message signal
is embodied by a high-power constellation while the authen-
tication signal is carried on a low-power constellation. An
adversary can emit just enough interference to exploit the
power diﬀerence between the two constellations to disable
the decoding of the authentication signal without disabling
the decoding of the message signal.
In FEAT, the frequency oﬀset in an OFDM symbol is
estimated using the correlation between CP samples and
corresponding data samples of the symbol. Hence, only a
subset of samples in an OFDM symbol is utilized for esti-
mation of the frequency oﬀset. This means that the change
in the correlation among samples in a symbol other than
the samples related to CP samples bear no eﬀect on the ex-

traction of the authentication signal in terms of interference
to the characteristics used to estimate ASd, i.e., frequency
oﬀset. If the received signal contains mutually exclusive sub-
sets of CP samples from multiple transmitters, these subsets
can be extracted and utilized to estimate frequency oﬀsets
in the signals received from multiple transmitters concur-
rently. In FEAT, the probability that the set of CP samples
of the two signals are mutually exclusive can be calculated
to be pe = 1 − Nc/Nf . This means that when we esti-
mate λ = Λ(r, Nf , Nc, α) to achieve the symbol synchro-
nization discussed in Section 4, we can observe two indepen-
dent peaks with probability pe. To illustrate this property,
we consider that Dave receives concurrent signals of equal
power from Alice with sample oﬀset α = 20 and Eve with
sample oﬀset α = 60. In this case, Figure 6 shows the am-
plitude of λ vs. α for known values of Nf and Nc. We can
easily detect the start of the symbol of the signals from Alice
at sample 20 and Eve at sample 60. When we synchronize
with α = 20, we can extract the authentication signal of Al-
ice. On the other hand, when we synchronize with α = 60,
we extract the authentication signal of Eve. Hence, FEAT is
extremely robust against interference from an adversary, and
hence OOA jamming attack is not possible for Eve without
detection. This means that FEAT enables Dave to detect
the identity of Eve easily if Eve utilizes even a small power
to jam the message or authentication signals from Alice.
6. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Based on the performance criteria established in Section 3.2,
we evaluate FEAT through comparison with two schemes
which represent the existing art of PHY-layer authentica-
tion: Authentication Tagging with Modulation (ATM)[25],
and Gelato [31].
In FEAT, one bit of the authentication signal is embed-
ded in each frame of the message signal by modifying its
frequency oﬀset, i.e., M = 2. In ATM, the authentication
signal is embedded into the message signal by changing the
phase of the QAM message samples. An authentication bit
of 1 is embedded by shifting the phase of a QAM sample to-
wards the Q-axis (representing quadrature-phase) by θ. An
authentication bit of 0 is embedded by shifting the phase to-
wards the I-axis (representing in-phase) by θ. For the sake
of comparison, we embed one authentication bit per frame
which means that the phase of all the QAM samples in a
frame are shifted in only one direction corresponding to the
authentication bit to be embedded. In Gelato, the authen-
tication signal is embedded into the transmitted OFDM sig-
nal by repeating Na QAM samples over the sub-carriers to
generate a cyclo-stationary signature. For the sake of com-
parison, we embed one authentication bit per frame which
means that all the OFDM symbols in a frame carry the
same signature. An authentication bit of 1 is embedded by
repeating the QAM samples from the ﬁrst Na sub-carriers
to the next Na sub-carriers. An authentication bit of 0 is
embedded by repeating the QAM samples from the last Na
sub-carriers to the previous Na sub-carriers.
Overhead: In FEAT, Alice embeds the frequency oﬀset
into the message signal through simple vector multiplication
over each frame. This means that no signiﬁcant computa-
tion overhead is incurred to include FEAT at Alice. Also,
there are no power and message throughput overheads at
Alice. In general, an intended receiver utilizes the pream-
ble symbols added at the beginning of each frame, and the
pilot samples in each symbol of the received signal to esti-
mate and correct the frequency oﬀset. In eﬀect, no change
is required in the message decoding procedure at Bob, and
the embedding of the authentication signal has no eﬀect on
