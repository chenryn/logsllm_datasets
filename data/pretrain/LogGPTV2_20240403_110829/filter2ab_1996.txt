### Title: Dynamic Process Isolation at Black Hat Asia 2022

**Abstract:**

Cloud computing offers flexible, scalable, and high-performance solutions for services. However, the shared hardware resources in cloud environments introduce potential vulnerabilities in both software and hardware. To meet high-performance requirements, cloud providers often use in-process isolation rather than strict process isolation. Language-level isolation, such as sandboxed V8 JavaScript isolates, is a common approach to isolate tenants. While this method provides security guarantees on the architectural side, it leaves single-process designs vulnerable to microarchitectural attacks, such as Spectre.

In this talk, we will present a remote Spectre attack that can leak secrets from other customers in an edge-computing solution that uses in-process language-level isolation. We will also discuss a defense mechanism developed in collaboration with Cloudflare. Cloudflare Workers, one of the leading edge-computing solutions, handles millions of HTTP requests per second for tens of thousands of websites worldwide. Cloudflare Workers attempts to mitigate Spectre attacks by using a modified V8 JavaScript sandbox that disables all known timers and primitives that could be abused to create timers. Despite these measures, we demonstrate a technique that can leak 2 bits per minute in such a restricted environment, using a remote timer and amplification techniques in the V8 engine.

Based on this attack, we introduce our main contribution: Dynamic Process Isolation. This solution uses hardware performance counters to monitor script isolation and dynamically isolate suspicious workloads into separate processes. Dynamic Process Isolation strikes a balance between the extremes of full process isolation and language-level isolation. Our real-world analysis shows that Dynamic Process Isolation is a lightweight solution, with a false-positive rate of only 0.61%, while providing security guarantees similar to those of strict process isolation. This solution has been integrated into the production environment of Cloudflare Workers.

Additionally, we will compare our approach to existing solutions and outline future research challenges.
