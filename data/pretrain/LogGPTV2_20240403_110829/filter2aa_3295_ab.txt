### 1.2.2 Information Assets Affected by the Audited Device

Since this organization is a one-person entity focused solely on creating and supporting the web site, the audited web application directly impacts almost every aspect of the organization. This includes all data owned by the organization and all services it provides. The only function unaffected by changes to the application is email, which is used independently by the site owner.

#### Information Assets

- **Source Code of the Web Application:**
  - **Description:** The web application represents a significant amount of development work and may serve as a foundation for future commercial projects.
  - **Security Concerns:** Public disclosure of the source code could compromise the site's security, as any vulnerabilities in the code would become public knowledge. However, if the code is well-written, this risk is minimized.

- **Public Data Stored in the Database:**
  - **Description:** Most of the information stored in the database is publicly available through the web application, making confidentiality less of a concern.
  - **Importance:** The availability and integrity of this data are critical for the site's functionality. Inaccurate or unavailable data could deter users from returning to the site.

- **Private Data Stored in the Database:**
  - **Description:** Some data in the database is not accessible to the public, including:
    - Real names of users (only usernames are visible to other users).
    - MD5 hashes of user passwords.
    - User email addresses.
    - Registration and last login dates for each user.
    - User access levels, with some users having administrative rights.

- **Bandwidth:**
  - **Description:** The web host imposes bandwidth limits. Exceeding these limits, whether through legitimate traffic or unauthorized use by another site, can result in additional costs or temporary shutdown of the site.

- **Services Provided by the Web Site:**
  - **Description:** The site offers a large amount of data, including unique content contributed by visitors and the site owner. The value of the site is largely dependent on this data and the underlying application code.

### 1.2.3 Major Vulnerabilities of the Web Application

The following are the major potential vulnerabilities in the web application, along with their likelihood of being exploited (on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being low and 5 being high) and the impact of a successful exploitation (using the same scale).

| Vulnerability | Likelihood (Exposure) | Impact |
|---------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Programming error allowing administrative access through the public interface | 3 | 4 |
| Malicious attacker gaining full access to the database | 3 | 4 |
| Catastrophic data loss at the web hosting company (due to environmental, malicious, or hardware issues) | 1 | 5 |
| Cross-site scripting attack | 3 | 4 |
| SQL injection attack | 3 | 4 |
| Non-critical programming error leading to partial or complete loss of functionality | 3 | 2 |
| Session hijacking via spoofed session identifier | 2 | 4 |
| Denial of service attack | 3 | 3 |
| Leak of hidden information through HTML comments | 2 | 3 |
| Session hijacking via modified client-side cookie | 3 | 4 |
| Brute-forcing or guessing an administrative password | 2 | 4 |
| Active sample files, scripts, or applications left on the web server | 3 | 4 |
| Modification of hidden form fields leading to unexpected behavior | 4 | 3 |
| Leak of hidden information through client-side JavaScript | 2 | 3 |
| Weak protection via client-side JavaScript | 3 | 4 |
| Collection of usernames through login error messages | 4 | 1 |
| Bandwidth theft by another site linking to images or media | 3 | 2 |
| Directory indexing exposing internal files | 2 | 3 |

### 1.3 Current State of Practice

#### 1.3.1 Articles, Papers, and Mailing Lists

Despite the importance of web sites to many companies, web application security has historically received less attention than it deserves. However, this situation has improved in recent years, with a wealth of articles, papers, and discussions now available online.

- **Web Application Security Mailing List:**
  - Hosted by SecurityFocus, this mailing list archives discussions dating back to January 2001, covering a wide range of web application security issues.

- **The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP):**
  - OWASP provides news, columns, and auditing tools. The most valuable resource is the "OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and Web Services," which covers all aspects of web application security. OWASP also plans to release a "Testing Guide" to document strategies and techniques for testing web applications for security vulnerabilities.

- **SANS Reading Room:**
  - Several papers in the SANS Reading Room are useful for web application security audits, including:
    - "Securing e-Commerce Web Sites" by Ariel Pisetsky.
    - "Web Application Security — Layers of Protection" by William Fredholm.
    - "Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities" by Mark Shiarla.

- **CERT Document:**
  - CERT has a comprehensive document on cross-site scripting, aimed at end users but still valuable for auditors and developers.

- **SQL Injection Attacks:**
  - "SQL Injection Attacks — Are You Safe?" by Mitchell Harper on SitePoint.
  - "SQL Injection Walkthrough" on SecuriTeam.com, focusing on exploiting and preventing SQL injection attacks.

- **Application Assessment Questioning:**
  - Gunter Ollmann's paper provides a comprehensive checklist for conducting an application assessment.

#### 1.3.2 Tools

Several free tools are available to assist in auditing web applications:

- **Nessus:**
  - An open-source security scanner with numerous plugins for detecting web application vulnerabilities. The open-source nature allows for reviewing the code and identifying similar potential issues.

This structured and detailed approach ensures that the text is clear, coherent, and professional, providing a comprehensive overview of the information assets, vulnerabilities, and current state of practice in web application security.
