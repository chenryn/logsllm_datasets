User: I have a python script that runs on a server after hours and invokes many shell subprocesses. None of the programs that are called should be prompting, but sometimes it happens and the script hangs, waiting for input until the user (me) notices and gets angry. :)
Tried: Using p.communicate() with stdin=PIPE, as written in the python subprocess documentation.
Running: Ubuntu 10.10, Python 2.6
I don't want to respond to the prompts, I want the script to raise an error and continue. Any thoughts?
Thanks,
Alexander.
Assistant: You need a time-out while waiting for your tasks to complete and then have your script kill or terminate the process (in addition to  raising the error).
