User: I wonder what is the best way to handle parallel SSH connections in python.
I need to open several SSH connections to keep in background and to feed commands in interactive or timed batch way.
Is this possible to do it with the paramiko libraries? It would be nice not to spawn a different SSH process for each connection.
Thanks.
Assistant: Reading the paramiko API docs, it looks like it is possible to open one ssh connection, and multiplex as many ssh tunnels on top of that as are wished. Common ssh clients (openssh) often do things like this automatically behind the scene if there is already a connection open.
