**Query:**

I am exploring the best approach to manage multiple parallel SSH connections in Python. My goal is to establish several SSH connections that can run in the background, allowing me to send commands either interactively or in scheduled batches. 

Is it possible to achieve this using the Paramiko library? Ideally, I would like to avoid spawning a separate SSH process for each connection.

**Response:**

Based on the Paramiko API documentation, it appears that you can indeed open a single SSH connection and then multiplex multiple SSH sessions over that connection. This is similar to how common SSH clients (like OpenSSH) often handle multiple sessions by automatically reusing an existing connection behind the scenes.
