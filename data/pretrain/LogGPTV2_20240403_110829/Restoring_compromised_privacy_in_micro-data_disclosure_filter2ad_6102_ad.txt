micro-disclosure:
• ∀i(1 ≤ i ≤ λ), Σλ(cid:48)
j=1xi,j = 1. I.e., each ID value can be
associated to only one sensitive value in one possible
instance table;
• ∀k, j(1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ λ(cid:48)),
Σidi∈πID ψk(publicT )xi,j = app(Vk, sj), where app(Vk, sj)
represents the number of times sj appears in Vk. I.e.,
a possible instance table must yield the same result as
baseT for any generalized disclosure.

i ≤ λ, 1 ≤ j ≤ λ(cid:48)) can be any real number within the
interval [0, 1].
and the proof of Theorem 1 in the work [9].
Claim 7 follows easily from the properties of micro-disclosure
Claim 7. Given a micro-disclosure ∆, its solver SOL(∆)
deﬁnes a polyhedron, of which every vertex A = (a1,1, . . . , aλ,λ(cid:48) )
is an integral point, i.e., ai,j = 0 ∨ ai,j = 1, (1 ≤ i ≤ λ, 1 ≤
j ≤ λ(cid:48).
Proof Sketch. Assume there is a vertex represented by
an assignment vector A (of X λλ(cid:48)
), in which there exists 0 <
ai1,jj < 1. Consider all ai,j in A such that ai,j = 1 or
ai,j = 0, assume the corresponding variable xi,j = ai,j to
be a constant in SOL(∆). We now reduce to a polyhedron
with smaller dimension, where the projection A(cid:48) of A should
still be a vertex. However, because every constant coeﬃcient
of this new linear equation system is an integer and every
variable coeﬃcient is 1, therefore, either (1) there exists a
small vector ¯ such that A(cid:48) − ¯ and A(cid:48) + ¯ are both in the
polyhedron, or (2) A(cid:48) is the only solution. However, (1)
is contradicted to the fact that A(cid:48) is a vertex, while (2) is
contradicted to the micro-disclosure ∆ itself because of the
existence of the baseT , i.e, baseT (with all variables to be 0
or 1) is always a solution to SOL(∆). This step completes
the proof.
We describe our sampling process by Algorithm 2. In it,
we denote by T a table over 2 attributes for id and s. We
denote by ∆ (cid:162) T the new micro-disclosure in which both ∆
and T are disclosed. Note that T can be also regarded as a
generalized disclosure where nothing is indeed generalized.
Claim 8. Given a micro-disclosure ∆ and its correspond-
ing P IS, (1) Algorithm 2 has the same functionality as Al-
gorithm 1 through a constructing tree of the P IS; (2) Al-
gorithm 2 generates an output in O((λλ(cid:48))4) time, where λ
is the size of baseT and λ(cid:48) the number of diﬀerent sensitive
values appeared in baseT .
Proof. Part (1) is clear because for any T ∈ P IS, it
must be contained in an possible output (w, T ) of Algo-
rithm 2. Also, based on Claim 7, in every output (w, T ) of
Algorithm 2, we know that T ∈ P IS and 1/w is the proba-
bility of T to be output by Algorithm 2.
For (2), note that it cost O((λλ(cid:48))3) to solve a linear equa-
tion system and ﬁnding a vertex of a polyhedron can be done
in O(λλ(cid:48)), where λλ(cid:48) is the number of variables (dimension).
Therefore, Algorithm 2 will output in λλ(cid:48)O((λλ(cid:48))3 + λλ(cid:48)) =
O((λλ(cid:48))4) time.

In this paper, we propose heuristic algorithms in which
additional generalized disclosures are restricted to the re-
ﬁnements of the previously disclosed ones. To illustrate,
we extend the medical information example from Section 1.

Note that in Algorithm 2 (line 12), if the vertex point
that we found is an integral point, there exists a possible
instance table consistent with the disclosures. I.e., sj is a
valid choice for idi. Claim 6 says that for a constant  and
θ, we need a constant number of samplings to be able to
verify a γ-Privacy with (, θ)-Conﬁdence. With Claim 6 and
Claim 8, we have the following result:

Besides the Public Knowledge disclosure, we have three
released generalized disclosures. Two of them are exactly
the same two views shown in Table 3(A) and Table 3(B).
The third generalized disclosure is shown in Table 7.

4. RESTORING COMPROMISED PRIVACY
In this section, we discuss how to restore compromised pri-
vacy, given a micro-disclosure ∆ = (publicT, {(V1, ψ1), . . . ,
(Vn, ψn)}), which violates the desired γ-Privacy or γ-Privacy
with (, θ)-Conﬁdence by releasing additional generalized dis-
closures. That is, we would like to ﬁnd a new micro-disclosure
∆(cid:48) = (publicT,{(V1, ψ1), . . . , (Vn, ψn), (Vn+1, ψn+1),
. . . , (Vn+K , ψn+K )}) which extends ∆, such that ∆(cid:48) satisﬁes
the desired privacy property. To do that, we need to answer
the following two questions:
• How many additional generalized disclosures do we
want to disclose?
• What generalized disclosures should be disclosed?
Selecting an Additional Generalized Disclosure
Intuitively, besides the generalized disclosures that have been
disclosed, we can construct any generalized disclosure which
by itself satisﬁes the desired privacy property. Note that the
original table baseT has a limited size λ. Therefore, we have
at most 2λ − (λ + 1) diﬀerent choices of additional disclo-
sures. The problem of whether there exists one of them such
that we can restore the privacy by disclosing it is thus decid-
able. However, whether there exists an eﬃcient algorithm to
decide (for γ-Privacy with (, θ)-Conﬁdence) is still an open

Table 7: The Third Generalized Disclosure
Note that in this example we will have the corresponding
possible instance set P IS that is not well-connected as dis-
cussed in previous sections. Assume that, as in Section 1,
we consider 0.5-Privacy.
It can be computed that in this
example, the adversary will win the (P IS, Donald, SARS)-
guessing game with a probability higher than 0.5, which vi-
olates the 0.5-Privacy.
To restore the compromised privacy, one possibility is to
disclose Table 5(A) and Table 5(B) as discussed in Section 1.
Another possibility, in this example, is to disclose the follow-
ing generalized disclosure shown in Table 8, together with
either Table 5(A) or Table 5(B) to restore the compromised
privacy.

Table 8: Another Additional Generalized Disclosure
However, from the information consumer’s point of view,
Table 8 is a worse choice than any of the Table 5(A) or
Table 5(B), because the latter two provide the desired in-
formation in a more precise way. That is, Table 5(A) is a
reﬁnement of Table 3(A) and Table 5(B) is a reﬁnement of
Table 3(B).
43Therefore, in practice, it may make sense to limit our
choices of additional generalized views to such a category.
Following this restriction, in this paper, we consider an ad-
ditional generalized disclosure selected from the set R(∆),
where R(∆) is called a single reﬁnement set:
for a given
micro-disclosure ∆ = (publicT,{(V1, ψ1), . . . , (Vn, ψn)}), it
is computed as R(∆) = {(V, ψ)|∃i(1 ≤ i ≤ n), σψ(baseT bl) =
σψσψi (baseT )}, where ψ is a propositional formula with-
out negation, disjunction, and “(cid:54)=”. Therefore, we have
|R(∆)| ≤ nλ2 ≤ λ3, where λ = |publicT|.
Selecting the Number of Additional Disclosures
Next, we need to decide how many additional generalized
disclosures we need to release in order to restore a compro-
mised privacy. Note that, because the original table baseT
has the size λ, we at most disclose λ additional generalized
|R(∆)|
disclosures. Therefore, we have up to (
)
diﬀerent choices, which is computationally infeasible to enu-
merate.

Unfortunately, for any constant K, we can construct an
example, in which, in order to restore the compromised pri-
vacy, we need to disclose exact K additional generalized dis-
closures from R(∆), as follows.
Let the baseT contain 3K + 1 ID values id1, . . . , id3K+1
and K + 2 diﬀerent sensitive values s1, . . . , sK+3, in which
for any i(i (cid:54)≡ 0 mod 3, i (cid:54)= 3K + 1), idi is associated with
si mod 3; for any i(i ≡ 0 mod 3), idi is associated with
si/3+2; id3K+1 is associated with s1. We have K generalized
disclosures (V1, ψ1), . . . , (VK , ψK ), where πIDσψi (baseT ) =
{id3(i−1)+1, id3(i−1)+2, id3(i−1)+3, id3K+1}, (1 ≤ i ≤ K). It
can be computed that the corresponding micro-disclosure ∆
is not 0.5-Private, because the probability for an adversary
to win the (P IS, id3K+1, s1)-guessing game is
2K
2K +1 .
In this case, the only way to restore the 0.5-Privacy is to
disclose K additional generalized views, each containing two
tuples from a single previously disclosed view and satisfying
0.5-Privacy by itself.
A Naive Efﬁcient Algorithm To Restore Privacy
Based on the discussion above, we can design a naive al-
gorithm to restore privacy, given a micro-disclosure ∆ that
violated a desired γ-Privacy with (, θ)-Conﬁdence, as fol-
lows: given a constant parameter K, the algorithm sim-
ply enumerates all possible 1-combinations, 2-combinations,
. . . , K-combinations of R(∆), the single reﬁnement set of
∆, and outputs the ﬁrst possible set of generalized disclo-
sures that leads to a new micro-disclosure which is γ-Private
with (, θ)-Conﬁdence or outputs “fail” otherwise. Clearly,
this naive algorithm will stop in O(λ3K+4λ(cid:48)4) time, where
λ is the number of ID values in the original table and λ(cid:48) is
the number of sensitive values. We will show that, through
experiments in Section 5, in practice we can have a good
percentage of successful privacy restoring by this naive al-
gorithm, even with K = 1.
5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
We conducted preliminary experiments based on the heart
disease records datum borrowed from the UCI data repos-
itory ([5]). Each of the four repository tables has such at-
tributes as person’s name, age, and level, which classiﬁes a
heart disease into 5 categories. We consider the attribute
level as sensitive and selecting 4 other attributes including
age as our QI attributes. Each time, we consider one of
the four repository tables, each having around 200 tuples.
Queries in the study are selections on a single QI attribute
that require the value to be in an interval [a, b]. The inter-
val is selected randomly, with a selected uniformly from the
interval range of the attribute, and b− a is chosen uniformly
(1) from 3.5% to 7% or (2) from 2% to 4% of the size of the
attribute range. If a query by itself violates 0.5-Privacy, it
is discarded. If not, we check if all queries so far collectively
satisfy 0.5-Privacy with (, θ)-conﬁdence, where  ≤ 0.1 and
θ ≥ 0.95, and stop the iterative process if they do not.
We then check whether it is possible to restore the vio-
lated 0.5-Private with (, θ) conﬁdence. Figure 1 refers to
the case when we use a single additional view to try and
restore privacy. The set of all views considered are all pos-
sible reﬁnements (in terms of the interval in the selection
condition) of previously disclosed views. Note that because
all QI attributes in the study are integers, there is a ﬁnite
number of considered views. Figure 1 gives the percentage
of cases (in 1000 runs), in which privacy was restored for
the cases of 1,2,3, and 4 QI attributes, and for both ranges
(1) from 3.5% to 7% (2) from 2% to 4% used in the original
