Abstract. The growing amount of traﬃc in mobile data networks is
causing concern for Internet service providers (ISPs), especially smaller
ISPs that need to lease expensive links to Tier 1 networks. Large amounts
of traﬃc in “peak” hours are of especial concern, since network capacity
must be provisioned to accommodate these peaks. In response, many
ISPs have begun trying to inﬂuence user behavior with pricing. Time-
dependent pricing (TDP) can help reduce peaks, since it allows ISPs to
charge higher prices during peak periods. We present results from the ﬁrst
TDP trial with a commercial ISP. In addition to analyzing application-
speciﬁc mobile and WiFi traﬃc, we compare changes in user behavior due
to monthly data caps and time-dependent prices. We ﬁnd that monthly
data caps tend to reduce usage, while TDP can increase usage as users
consume more data during discounted times. Moreover, unlike data caps,
TDP reduces the network’s peak-to-average usage ratio, lessening the
need for network over-provisioning and increasing ISP proﬁt.
1 Introduction
Mobile data usage is growing at unprecedented rates, with Cisco estimating
that global mobile data traﬃc grew 81 % in 2013 and projecting a compound
annual growth rate of 61 % over the next ﬁve years [1]. This trend has signif-
icantly increased ISPs’ capital expenses, as they must provision their network
to accommodate peak usage during the day [3,16]. Smaller ISPs are particu-
larly aﬀected, as their network capacity is limited by middle mile links to Tier
1 operators, which are leased at rates based on peak usage [20]. Many ISPs are
therefore trying to reduce their peak mobile data traﬃc [18,22]. In this paper, we
focus on the use of pricing as an incentive for users to reduce their peak usage.
Most U.S. ISPs charge ﬁxed fees for limited monthly data caps. Yet data caps
may not eﬀectively limit usage peaks, as users can remain under their caps by
using less data at oﬀ-peak times and not changing their peak-time usage. Time-
dependent pricing (TDP) allows the ISP to eﬀectively target network peaks
by oﬀering higher prices at those times, incentivizing users to consume data

at other times. Yet TDP’s eﬀectiveness depends on users’ willingness to shift
their data usage in exchange for reduced prices, which can vary for diﬀerent
users and applications: business users, for instance, might not wait to download
email attachments, but teenagers might wait to download video purchases [8].
To the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic studies of these price-delay
tolerances, and no works on TDP have yet accounted for the eﬀect of displaying
usage statistics to users: showing users these statistics would make them more
aware of their usage and might aﬀect their usage behavior. Previous trials have
only focused on university populations [2,8].
In this paper, we present results from the ﬁrst TDP trial with a commercial
ISP. We recruited 27 customers of a local U.S. ISP, dividing users into time-
independent pricing (TIP) and TDP groups. The TIP users used a data usage
monitoring application with their regular pricing plan. We show that this mon-
itoring induced them to reduce their usage below their monthly data caps, but
that they still had very high peak usage. The TDP users both monitored their
data usage and received time-dependent prices; we show that the prices induced
TDP users to increase their usage at discounted times. Thus, simple data caps do
not eﬀectively reduce ISPs’ peak network usage, but TDP does. Our work makes
the following contributions:
– An analysis of the results of the ﬁrst TDP trial with a commercial ISP, includ-
– A study of temporal and per-app WiFi and cellular usage data.
– An analysis of the impact of data usage monitoring apps on cellular and WiFi
– An evaluation of real customers’ price sensitivity and delay tolerance for dif-

ferent applications.
– An examination of TDP’s cost beneﬁts with empirical price sensitivity and
delay tolerance estimates.
In the next section, we give an overview of related work. We then describe
the trial structure and our analysis methodology in Sect. 3. We analyze users’
pre-trial data usage in Sect. 4 before presenting the trial results in Sect. 5.
We conclude in Sect. 6.
2 Related Work
Previous trials in a university setting demonstrated TDP’s eﬀectiveness in chang-
ing mobile data usage patterns [8]. Others have suggested that data usage and
user responses to incentives depend on psychological [2] or socioeconomic [14]
factors. Another work on price elasticities for wireline broadband speeds consid-
ers a wider population [7]. These trials, however, do not analyze TDP’s eﬀects
on diﬀerent apps or account for the eﬀect of simply displaying usage statistics to
users. We ﬁnd that displaying usage statistics generally decreases usage volume,
but when combined with TDP can result in increased usage at low-price times.

Many studies have found a signiﬁcant time-of-day pattern in cellular net-
work traﬃc [11]. Others have analyzed LTE network performance [9] and com-
pared the performance of diﬀerent network interfaces (e.g., LTE and WiFi) [19].
Papers focusing on individual users’ data consumption show a large diversity
in the amount of data used by diﬀerent users and diﬀerent apps on mobile and
WiFi networks [5,6,13,21]. These lead to distinct temporal usage patterns, which
[12] showed can be leveraged to improve users’ experience with intelligent WiFi
oﬄoading. Similarly, [10] shows that delaying mobile oﬀ-screen traﬃc, which is
assumed to be delay-tolerant, can improve energy usage. Another work on Super
Bowl traﬃc shows that short-term delays can be leveraged to eliminate conges-
tion [4]. Our work provides a more nuanced estimation of delay tolerances and
examines their monetary value to users by oﬀering price incentives.
3 Methodology
We designed the trial to determine the eﬀects of data usage monitoring and a
combination of TDP with usage monitoring. We ﬁrst outline the trial structure
and then describe the data collected and apps distributed to trial participants.
We ﬁnally present a model for users’ price-delay tolerances that allows us to
evaluate TDP’s beneﬁts for ISPs.
3.1 Trial Participants and Structure
We recruited 27 active trial participants from an ISP’s customer base. While our
sample size is small, the number of participants was limited by the fact that we
changed some of their mobile data plans to TDP, broadening the trial’s ﬁnancial
implications beyond those of simply measuring usage. All participants used their
own Android devices. They did not use data monitoring apps before the trial,
but did have monthly data caps.
All active participants downloaded custom-built apps for the trial, which
we describe in more detail in the next section. These participants were divided
into two groups: time-independent pricing (TIP) and TDP users. The TIP users
installed data monitoring apps, allowing us to estimate the eﬀect of usage mon-
itoring with data caps. The TDP users’ app both monitored data and oﬀered
time-dependent prices. Thus, their behavior is aﬀected by both data monitoring
and TDP. We additionally collected passive network data on more than 5000
“control” users, who did not install any apps. Table 1 summarizes the three
groups of users.
The control and TIP users’ data caps, which are not shared among devices,
ranged from 1 to 10 GB and were the same as before the trial. TDP users were
charged hourly time-dependent prices, e.g., $10/GB from 12 to 1am and $15/GB
from 1 to 2 am. The prices oﬀered ranged from $10/GB to $20/GB, and were
chosen to be no higher than the ISP’s most popular data plan: a monthly 1 GB
cap for $19.99. Prices were randomly determined and shown to the TDP users
24 hours in advance, allowing them to plan their usage over the next day.

3.2 Data Collection
Our dataset consists of two separate types of data: one 21.5 GB set of RADIUS
network data, and one 10.5 GB set of application usage data. The RADIUS data
was collected from March 2012 to June 2013 for all TIP, TDP, and control group
users and contains 140 million session records, including input and output byte
counts and start and end timestamps.
The second dataset was collected by TIP and TDP trial participants’ apps
during the June 2013 trial. This data consists of uplink and downlink cellular and
WiFi byte counts for every application, collected every ten minutes, as well as
the hourly prices oﬀered to TDP participants.1 We developed separate TDP and
TIP apps for the trial, which collect usage information and display it to users.
The TIP app is a usage monitoring application with screens shown in Fig. 1a,
b and c. Users could view their monthly, weekly, and daily usage as a fraction
of their data cap (Fig. 1a and b), as well as their per-app usage (Fig. 1c). Daily
and weekly data caps were calculated based on the monthly cap and number of

days left in the month. Users could quickly see the remaining fraction of their
monthly cap by looking at the pie chart icon on the bar at the top of the screen.
The TDP app allows users to monitor their spending on data and see the
future prices. As with the TIP app, users can see their per-app usage (Fig. 1c).
However, the main screen has been modiﬁed (Fig. 1d) to show the future prices
and the amount the user has spent during the month. On the top left of the home
screen bar, we show a color-coded price indicator that is visible both inside and
outside our app; the indicator lets users easily see the current price, making it
easier for them to decide whether or not to consume data at a given time [15].
It is colored red, orange, yellow, or green for high, medium, low, and very low
prices respectively.
3.3 Estimating Price-Delay Tolerances and Optimizing Prices
We quantify users’ price-delay tolerances by ﬁtting their observed usage with TDP
to a model of users’ expected usage volume given the prices oﬀered and their price-
delay tolerances. We then calculate the ISP’s expected proﬁt and users’ expected
traﬃc patterns with these user parameters. We use the following process:
Establish baseline usage: We establish the average amount of data used in
each hour of the day by extrapolating from TDP users’ pre-trial RADIUS data.
We divide the usage into diﬀerent apps using the fraction of data used by each
app in each hour by TIP users.2
Model users’ price-delay tolerances: We use a model adapted from our
previous work [8,17]. We deﬁne “waiting functions” wβ(d, t) that give the prob-
ability that a user will wait for time t, given a savings d on the usage price. The
waiting functions have the form wβ(d, t) = C(β) max(d, 0)(t + 1)−β, where C(β)
is a normalization constant and the β parameter controls the user’s “willingness-
to-wait:” wβ decreases faster with t for larger β, making users less likely to wait
for longer amounts of time. The value of β diﬀers for diﬀerent applications, e.g.,
a user is more likely to delay a software update than checking email. We can
compare apps’ delay tolerances by comparing their β parameters.
Estimate the model parameters: We choose the model parameters that
provide the best ﬁt between observed TDP trial usage and the usage predicted
by our model, given the prices oﬀered during the trial.
To predict TDP usage, we identify two types of changes in usage relative to
the baseline: ﬁrst, users may shift some usage from higher- to lower-priced times.
We use the waiting functions above to calculate the expected amounts shifted for
each app. Second, price discounts can induce users to increase their overall usage
[15,17]. Since the amount of the increase depends on the app and time of the day
(e.g., users are unlikely to increase their usage while sleeping), we parameterize
the usage increase with αa(t), which depends on the app a and hour t. We use
2 We use per-app data for the TIP users since TDP can skew the app distribution [8],
and we have no pre-trial per-app data. RADIUS logs do not have per-app data, and
distributing apps before the trial would have skewed users’ behavior.

the form Va(t)
, where Va(t) is the pre-trial (baseline) usage
for app a and d(t) the discount oﬀered (i.e., the maximum price, normalized to 1,
minus the oﬀered price) in hour t. In accordance with the economic principle of
diminishing marginal utility, we constrain αa(t) ∈ [0, 1]. Note that if αa(t) = 0,
the usage does not increase with d(t). We add this term to the amount of traﬃc
shifted to ﬁnd the total traﬃc for each app in each hour as a function of the
discounts oﬀered and model parameters β and αa(t).
Calculate proﬁt-maximizing prices: Given the parameter estimates, we can
optimize the prices oﬀered over the day so as to maximize ISPs’ proﬁt with TDP,
i.e., revenue minus cost. The revenue is simply the sum of the time-dependent
prices multiplied by the expected usage under TDP. We model the cost as a
piecewise-linear function, with zero marginal cost below a ﬁxed capacity C and
a constant marginal cost γ for usage above this capacity. Thus, ISPs will choose
time-dependent prices so as to maximize their proﬁt

where X(t) is the expected usage at time t after TDP. By continually
re-estimating the price-delay tolerances and re-optimizing the prices oﬀered
accordingly, the ISP can adapt its prices to changes in user behavior.
4 Traﬃc Characteristics
In this section, we ﬁrst construct baseline usage information for TIP, TDP, and
control users from our pre-trial RADIUS dataset. We then characterize the major
apps used by TIP and TDP users. In all ﬁgures, hours given are in local time.
4.1 How Much Data Do Users Consume?
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of all users’ average
daily usage. We see that the TIP and TDP users use similar amounts of data,
ranging from 2 to 100MB, i.e., a few hundred MB to 3 GB per month. While a
