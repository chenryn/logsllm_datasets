## Abstract
The increasing volume of mobile data traffic is a growing concern for Internet service providers (ISPs), particularly smaller ISPs that must lease expensive links to Tier 1 networks. Peak-hour traffic is especially problematic as it requires significant network capacity. To address this, many ISPs are using pricing strategies to influence user behavior. Time-dependent pricing (TDP) can help reduce peak usage by charging higher prices during peak periods. This paper presents results from the first TDP trial with a commercial ISP. We analyze application-specific mobile and WiFi traffic and compare changes in user behavior due to monthly data caps and TDP. Our findings indicate that while monthly data caps reduce overall usage, TDP can increase usage during discounted times. Additionally, TDP reduces the peak-to-average usage ratio, thereby decreasing the need for over-provisioning and increasing ISP profits.

## 1. Introduction
Mobile data usage is experiencing unprecedented growth, with Cisco estimating an 81% increase in global mobile data traffic in 2013 and projecting a compound annual growth rate of 61% over the next five years. This trend has significantly increased ISPs' capital expenses, as they must provision their networks to handle peak usage. Smaller ISPs are particularly affected due to their reliance on leased middle-mile links to Tier 1 operators, which are priced based on peak usage. Many ISPs are therefore exploring ways to reduce peak mobile data traffic. In this paper, we focus on the use of pricing as an incentive to reduce peak usage.

Most U.S. ISPs currently charge fixed fees for limited monthly data caps. However, data caps may not effectively limit peak usage, as users can stay within their caps by reducing off-peak usage without changing their peak-time habits. TDP allows ISPs to target network peaks by offering higher prices during those times, incentivizing users to shift their usage to other times. The effectiveness of TDP depends on users' willingness to delay their data usage in exchange for lower prices, which can vary among different users and applications. For example, business users may not be willing to wait to download email attachments, while teenagers might wait to download video purchases.

To our knowledge, there are no systematic studies on these price-delay tolerances, and no previous works on TDP have considered the effect of displaying usage statistics to users. Previous trials have only focused on university populations. In this paper, we present results from the first TDP trial with a commercial ISP. We recruited 27 customers of a local U.S. ISP, dividing them into time-independent pricing (TIP) and TDP groups. TIP users used a data usage monitoring application with their regular pricing plan, which induced them to reduce their usage below their monthly data caps but did not significantly reduce peak usage. TDP users both monitored their data usage and received time-dependent prices, leading them to increase their usage at discounted times. Thus, simple data caps do not effectively reduce ISPs' peak network usage, but TDP does.

Our contributions include:
- An analysis of the first TDP trial with a commercial ISP.
- A study of temporal and per-app WiFi and cellular usage data.
- An analysis of the impact of data usage monitoring apps on cellular and WiFi usage behavior.
- An evaluation of real customers' price sensitivity and delay tolerance for different applications.
- An examination of TDP's cost benefits with empirical price sensitivity and delay tolerance estimates.

In the next section, we provide an overview of related work. We then describe the trial structure and our analysis methodology in Section 3. We analyze users' pre-trial data usage in Section 4 before presenting the trial results in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.

## 2. Related Work
Previous trials in a university setting have demonstrated the effectiveness of TDP in changing mobile data usage patterns. Other studies have suggested that data usage and user responses to incentives depend on psychological or socioeconomic factors. Research on price elasticities for wireline broadband speeds has also been conducted, but these trials do not analyze TDP's effects on different apps or account for the effect of displaying usage statistics to users. We find that displaying usage statistics generally decreases usage volume, but when combined with TDP, it can result in increased usage at low-price times.

Many studies have found a significant time-of-day pattern in cellular network traffic. Others have analyzed LTE network performance and compared the performance of different network interfaces (e.g., LTE and WiFi). Papers focusing on individual users' data consumption show a large diversity in the amount of data used by different users and different apps on mobile and WiFi networks. These lead to distinct temporal usage patterns, which can be leveraged to improve users' experience with intelligent WiFi offloading. Similarly, delaying mobile off-screen traffic, which is assumed to be delay-tolerant, can improve energy usage. Another study on Super Bowl traffic shows that short-term delays can be leveraged to eliminate congestion. Our work provides a more nuanced estimation of delay tolerances and examines their monetary value to users by offering price incentives.

## 3. Methodology
We designed the trial to determine the effects of data usage monitoring and a combination of TDP with usage monitoring. We first outline the trial structure and then describe the data collected and apps distributed to trial participants. We finally present a model for users' price-delay tolerances that allows us to evaluate TDP's benefits for ISPs.

### 3.1 Trial Participants and Structure
We recruited 27 active trial participants from an ISP's customer base. While our sample size is small, the number of participants was limited by the fact that we changed some of their mobile data plans to TDP, broadening the trial's financial implications beyond those of simply measuring usage. All participants used their own Android devices and had monthly data caps but did not use data monitoring apps before the trial.

All active participants downloaded custom-built apps for the trial. These participants were divided into two groups: TIP and TDP users. TIP users installed data monitoring apps, allowing us to estimate the effect of usage monitoring with data caps. TDP users' app both monitored data and offered time-dependent prices, affecting their behavior through both data monitoring and TDP. We additionally collected passive network data on more than 5000 "control" users, who did not install any apps. Table 1 summarizes the three groups of users.

Table 1: Three groups of trial participants.
| Group | Recruitment | Data Collection | Data Plan |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Control | Random | RADIUS logs | Unchanged |
| TIP | Volunteer | Trial app & RADIUS | Unchanged |
| TDP | Volunteer | Trial app & RADIUS | TDP rates |

The control and TIP users' data caps, which are not shared among devices, ranged from 1 to 10 GB and were the same as before the trial. TDP users were charged hourly time-dependent prices, e.g., $10/GB from 12 to 1 am and $15/GB from 1 to 2 am. Prices ranged from $10/GB to $20/GB and were chosen to be no higher than the ISP's most popular data plan: a monthly 1 GB cap for $19.99. Prices were randomly determined and shown to TDP users 24 hours in advance, allowing them to plan their usage over the next day.

### 3.2 Data Collection
Our dataset consists of two types of data: a 21.5 GB set of RADIUS network data and a 10.5 GB set of application usage data. The RADIUS data was collected from March 2012 to June 2013 for all TIP, TDP, and control group users and contains 140 million session records, including input and output byte counts and start and end timestamps.

The second dataset was collected by TIP and TDP trial participants' apps during the June 2013 trial. This data consists of uplink and downlink cellular and WiFi byte counts for every application, collected every ten minutes, as well as the hourly prices offered to TDP participants. We developed separate TDP and TIP apps for the trial, which collect usage information and display it to users.

The TIP app is a usage monitoring application with screens shown in Figure 1(a), (b), and (c). Users could view their monthly, weekly, and daily usage as a fraction of their data cap, as well as their per-app usage. Daily and weekly data caps were calculated based on the monthly cap and the number of days left in the month. Users could quickly see the remaining fraction of their monthly cap by looking at the pie chart icon on the bar at the top of the screen.

The TDP app allows users to monitor their spending on data and see future prices. As with the TIP app, users can see their per-app usage. However, the main screen has been modified to show future prices and the amount the user has spent during the month. On the top left of the home screen bar, we show a color-coded price indicator that is visible both inside and outside our app. The indicator lets users easily see the current price, making it easier for them to decide whether or not to consume data at a given time. It is colored red, orange, yellow, or green for high, medium, low, and very low prices, respectively.

### 3.3 Estimating Price-Delay Tolerances and Optimizing Prices
We quantify users' price-delay tolerances by fitting their observed usage with TDP to a model of users' expected usage volume given the prices offered and their price-delay tolerances. We then calculate the ISP's expected profit and users' expected traffic patterns with these user parameters. We use the following process:

1. **Establish Baseline Usage**: We establish the average amount of data used in each hour of the day by extrapolating from TDP users' pre-trial RADIUS data. We divide the usage into different apps using the fraction of data used by each app in each hour by TIP users.

2. **Model Users' Price-Delay Tolerances**: We use a model adapted from our previous work. We define "waiting functions" \( w_\beta(d, t) \) that give the probability that a user will wait for time \( t \), given a savings \( d \) on the usage price. The waiting functions have the form \( w_\beta(d, t) = C(\beta) \max(d, 0)(t + 1)^{-\beta} \), where \( C(\beta) \) is a normalization constant and the \( \beta \) parameter controls the user's "willingness-to-wait": \( w_\beta \) decreases faster with \( t \) for larger \( \beta \), making users less likely to wait for longer amounts of time. The value of \( \beta \) differs for different applications, e.g., a user is more likely to delay a software update than checking email. We can compare apps' delay tolerances by comparing their \( \beta \) parameters.

3. **Estimate the Model Parameters**: We choose the model parameters that provide the best fit between observed TDP trial usage and the usage predicted by our model, given the prices offered during the trial.

To predict TDP usage, we identify two types of changes in usage relative to the baseline: first, users may shift some usage from higher- to lower-priced times. We use the waiting functions above to calculate the expected amounts shifted for each app. Second, price discounts can induce users to increase their overall usage. Since the amount of the increase depends on the app and time of the day (e.g., users are unlikely to increase their usage while sleeping), we parameterize the usage increase with \( \alpha_a(t) \), which depends on the app \( a \) and hour \( t \). We use the form \( V_a(t) (1 + d(t))^{\alpha_a(t)} - 1 \), where \( V_a(t) \) is the pre-trial (baseline) usage for app \( a \) and \( d(t) \) the discount offered (i.e., the maximum price, normalized to 1, minus the offered price) in hour \( t \). In accordance with the economic principle of diminishing marginal utility, we constrain \( \alpha_a(t) \in [0, 1] \). Note that if \( \alpha_a(t) = 0 \), the usage does not increase with \( d(t) \). We add this term to the amount of traffic shifted to find the total traffic for each app in each hour as a function of the discounts offered and model parameters \( \beta \) and \( \alpha_a(t) \).

4. **Calculate Profit-Maximizing Prices**: Given the parameter estimates, we can optimize the prices offered over the day so as to maximize ISPs' profit with TDP, i.e., revenue minus cost. The revenue is simply the sum of the time-dependent prices multiplied by the expected usage under TDP. We model the cost as a piecewise-linear function, with zero marginal cost below a fixed capacity \( C \) and a constant marginal cost \( \gamma \) for usage above this capacity. Thus, ISPs will choose time-dependent prices so as to maximize their profit:
\[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} (1 - d(t)) X(t) - \gamma \max(X(t) - C, 0) \]
where \( X(t) \) is the expected usage at time \( t \) after TDP. By continually re-estimating the price-delay tolerances and re-optimizing the prices offered accordingly, the ISP can adapt its prices to changes in user behavior.

## 4. Traffic Characteristics
In this section, we first construct baseline usage information for TIP, TDP, and control users from our pre-trial RADIUS dataset. We then characterize the major apps used by TIP and TDP users. In all figures, hours given are in local time.

### 4.1 How Much Data Do Users Consume?
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of all users' average daily usage. We see that the TIP and TDP users use similar amounts of data, ranging from 2 to 100 MB, i.e., a few hundred MB to 3 GB per month. While a
