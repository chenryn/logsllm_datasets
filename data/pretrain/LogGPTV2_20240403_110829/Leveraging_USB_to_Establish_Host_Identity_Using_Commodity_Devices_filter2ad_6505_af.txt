USB Fingerprinting is a technique that can allow for the
identiﬁcation of unique machines in many cases, and can
accurately differentiate over host attributes such as machine
model and OS. We showed that a commodity smartphone is
sufﬁcient for collecting data, thus obviating the need for ex-
pensive dedicated USB analyzers to perform these operations.
This work opens an intriguing avenue for future investi-
gation, particularly as ever more unique interfaces, potentially
possessing their own characteristic stimuli and responses, come
to market. This future work will involve determining whether
our techniques work on technologies such as Firewire, Apple’s
new “Lightning” interface, and other commodity interfaces,
and whether we can loosen restrictions on detaching pe-
ripherals prior to measurement. Formalizing and modeling
interactions with these protocols would be of great interest
to those looking to exploit and defend these interfaces and the
devices that use them.
