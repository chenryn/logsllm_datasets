Originally I wanted to display radio buttons without the possibility of
changing them.  
I tried using the `read_only` attribute on my field type first:
    $builder->add('onCall', 'choice', array(
        'choices' => array(0 => 'no', 1 => 'yes'),
        'expanded' => true,
        'read_only' => true
    ));
As expected the `readonly` attribute gets added to the `input`:
But in the end this does not have any effect since - as we all know by now -
`readonly` is not supported for radio buttons:  
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-forms-970402#readonly  
`READONLY applies to INPUT elements of type TEXT or PASSWORD and to the
TEXTAREA element.`
So allowing the `read_only` option on an `expanded` `choice` does not seem to
make sense anyway, correct?
The desired effect on the element should be to disable it. But setting
`disabled` on the field type will ignore validation after form submit if the
radio buttons have been enabled again by a javascript on client side.
So it looks like the only way to do it is to set the HTML attribute `disabled`
on the field type.  
This way it can be enabled again by the client and the submitted value would
not be ignored.
My attempt for this:
    $builder->add('onCall', 'choice', array(
        'choices' => array(0 => 'no', 1 => 'yes'),
        'expanded' => true,
        'attr' => array('disabled' => 'disabled')
    ));
Unfortunately the HTML result does not apply the `disabled` attribute to the
`input` but to the `div` around it:
    no
    yes
I'm not using the Bootstrap theme.
Setting the `attr` seems to be the issue:

The `div` uses the `widget_container_attributes` block:  
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Resources/views/Form/form_div_layout.html.twig#L46
While the `input` uses a `widget_attributes` block:  
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Bridge/Twig/Resources/views/Form/form_div_layout.html.twig#L93
Are the `attr` passed to the wrong block?
