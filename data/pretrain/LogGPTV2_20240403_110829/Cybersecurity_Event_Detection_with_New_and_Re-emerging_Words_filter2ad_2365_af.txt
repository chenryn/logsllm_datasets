through Embedi blog and ZDNet. On January 3rd 2019, W2E de-
tected the event with the words “wifi”, “chromebooks”, “marvell”,
“avanstar”, “playstations”, and “samsung” from the tweet “unauth,
unassoc remote code exec on the Marvell Avanstar Wifi chip SoC used
in Playstations, Xbox, Surfaces, Chromebooks, Samsung phones and
more in under five minutes attack time. Bonus second stage escala-
tion in the linux drivers, PoC on steamlink. https://t.co/s54QBc5mDK”.
This case clearly shows the early detection capability of W2E as
well as the benefit of monitoring open data sources.
6 LIMITATION
Twitter User Restriction. In W2E, there are various design choices
that can affect its performance. We design W2E to achieve high
performance on detection of security events that threaten end-user
devices like smartphones, smart appliances, and IoT devices. For
Session 13: Malware ASIA CCS ’20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan676this, we construct the list of users who mention security events
related to end-user devices in accordance with our observation in
Section 3 (Security events related to malware, exploit, and vulnera-
bility are mostly started by security experts, security firms,and news
media). This leads that our data collection is more from security-
minded users than other users. Although user restriction is effective
to reduce false positives, it can decrease event detection coverage
and increase detection latency. As seen from the evaluation results
in Section 5.2, W2E leads to 0.67 days delay in detection on average,
although 45 out of 82 events were detected without delay. This time
delay is likely caused by user restriction. In addition, we analyzed
9 events that could not be detected by W2E. We found that they
were never mentioned or mentioned only once by the users in our
Twitter user list. Also, as seen in Table 2, W2E showed a relatively
lower recall for DDoS incidents than malware attacks, exploit inci-
dents, vulnerabilities, and data breach incidents. We believe this is
caused by our user construction strategy. As we observed in Sec-
tion 3, discussions about events like DDoS, phishing, and account
hijacking events are likely to be started by any users who suffer
from those attacks rather than security-minded users.
Keyword-based Filter. W2E extracts tweets for candidate events
through the filter with a set of threat-related keywords. Majority of
the existing event detection methods in the cybersecurity domain
take keyword matching as the first step to retrieve tweets related to
security events [27, 29, 40, 49]. However, it is difficult to configure
how keywords should be selected to keep the balance between false
positive rate and false negative rate. Even with the security-specific
keywords like “malware”, we observed several tweets irrelevant to
security events, which causes false positives. For example, there
are several tweets hiring malware analysts in malware category.
Due to this problem, Ritter et al. [40] and Zong et al. [49] built a
classifier to determine whether each tweet containing keywords is a
real security event or not. Since W2E monitors the words in tweets
containing keywords, it is sensitive to noisy tweets. Although we
restrict Twitter accounts, most of false positives in W2E come from
noisy tweets that pass through the keyword-based filter. For this
reason, replacing the keywords-based filter with a classification-
based filter can help to reduce false positives.
7 CONCLUSION
We propose a novel word-based cybersecurity event detection sys-
tem. The proposed system monitors new words and re-emerging
words by analyzing the occurrences of words over time. Our new/re-
emerging words detection algorithms are motivated by anomaly
detection in the distribution of words or the occurrences of words
in time domain. After identifying the words related to security
events, our event detection algorithm clusters the triggered tweets
for event construction. This approach enables to detect new and
resurgent threats, regardless of their volume of mentions. We em-
pirically demonstrate that the proposed event detection system
performs promisingly over a wide range of cyber threat types.
