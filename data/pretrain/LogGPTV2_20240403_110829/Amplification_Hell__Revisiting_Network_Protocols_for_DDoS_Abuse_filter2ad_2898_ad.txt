### 4.6 Analysis of Network Scans and DRDoS Victims

#### 4.6.1 Network Scans

The following table summarizes the network scans observed in the dataset, including the ports, protocols, and packet statistics:

The low packet sizes for scans targeting Teredo tunnels and two unknown services (ports 4614 and 39455) suggest that attackers may be searching for devices vulnerable to amplification attacks. However, manual inspection of the payload did not reveal any clear intention behind these scans.

Scans for MSSQL servers indicate other motivations, such as identifying devices vulnerable to exploitation. The absence of significant packet rates (pps) and the small packet sizes (Bpp) for most of these scans suggest that these are not related to amplification attacks.

#### 4.6.2 Real-World DRDoS Victims

In this section, we aim to detect DRDoS victims within an ISP's network. We follow the intuition that DRDoS victims will receive large amounts of traffic from amplifiers, while they have never requested data from the amplifiers.

**Figure 2: A DRDoS Attack Scenario**

A typical amplification attack scenario is shown in Figure 2. In this example, three amplifiers (black nodes) are abused by an attacker to relay large amounts of traffic to the victim. Due to IP address spoofing, the attacker remains invisible to the victim. However, from the victim's perspective, the amplifiers can be detected by correlating the in- and outgoing traffic per client. For instance, while amplifier M2 sends traffic with an average bandwidth of 3 MB/s, the victim V never sent any requests to M2. In normal cases, such as for legitimate hosts a and b, we observe a more balanced ratio between in- and outgoing traffic. Note that high bandwidth towards a host alone is not only characteristic of DRDoS attacks. For example, nodes V and a may transfer large files using UDP, causing high transfer rates.

**Detection Methodology**

We leverage these observations to detect victims of amplification attacks using the NetFlow dataset. For each client/server pair, we extract a few network characteristics by aggregating NetFlow data. In this context, a server runs a specific service that is vulnerable to amplification attacks, thus representing potential amplifiers. We restrict our analysis to network protocols that use a fixed UDP port, allowing us to identify servers by their (IP address, UDP port) tuple. For example, to find DNS servers, we search for hosts that send UDP packets with source port 53. A client is any host, identified only by its IP address (ignoring client ports), communicating with a server. We consider all clients as potential DRDoS victims. In rare cases where both hosts of a flow communicate on server ports, we treat both hosts as both client and server.

We then create a pairflow for each client/server pair and aggregate the following communication features:
- **Client IP (CIP)**: The IP address of the client.
- **Server IP (SIP)**: The IP address of the server.
- **Server Port (Sport)**: The UDP port of the server.
- **B2s**: Number of bytes from the client to the server.
- **B2c**: Number of bytes from the server to the client.
- **Pairflow Duration (t)**: The interval between the first and last packet of the client/server pair.

We compute the pairflows for each hour in our NetFlow dataset, covering 288 hours over 12 days. This allows us to speed up computation and decrease the latency between the attack and attack detection. We apply a heuristic to find clients that are potential DRDoS victims by:
1. Filtering on pairflows exceeding a traffic threshold.
2. Filtering on clients that received significantly more traffic than they sent to the server.

For the first filter, we discard all pairflows \( f \) where \( f.B2c < Tr \). In our evaluation, we chose a conservative setting of \( Tr = 1000 \), i.e., raise suspicion for all servers (potential amplifiers) that send more than 1000x the traffic volume to the client (potential victim) than they received from it.

**Results**

Table V lists the 15 DRDoS attacks against subscribers of the ISP that our analysis on the NetFlow dataset revealed. All times listed in the table are GMT. We assigned a unique label (A–I) to the victims and hide IP addresses for privacy reasons. As expected, the majority of the attacks involved DNS amplification. The largest attack spanned 711 MBit/s from 330 amplifiers and lasted for three hours. The shortest attack lasted for 39 seconds with a bandwidth of 212 MBit/s. Interestingly, attackers also abuse further protocols. We found four CharGen-based attacks that involved up to 3065 amplifiers. Against victims C and G, we observed attacks abusing both DNS and CharGen simultaneously. Victim F was first targeted with a low-volume CharGen-based attack, until the attackers switched to DNS and achieved almost 1 Gb/s attack capacity.
