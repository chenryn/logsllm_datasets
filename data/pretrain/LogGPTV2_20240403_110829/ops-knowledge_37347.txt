Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am interested in creating both SOAP and REST web services in Python, which can be called from an iPhone. I have already installed Python 2.7.1 on Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS using PuTTY. Now, I am looking for a user-friendly and efficient framework to help me develop these web services and perform web programming.

After conducting extensive research, I find the variety of available frameworks confusing. For RESTful web services, I have heard positive feedback about Flask. Could you provide recommendations or guidance on suitable frameworks for both SOAP and REST, and any additional considerations for integrating with iOS?
