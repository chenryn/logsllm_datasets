### Experimental Results and Analysis

#### Testing the Second Hypothesis
We tested the clicks of the "l" and "k" keys (Figure 10) to evaluate the second hypothesis, which posits that microscopic differences in key elements significantly affect the sound produced. Our experiment led us to conclude that this hypothesis can be ruled out. The microscopic differences in key elements play no or only a minor role in making the clicks sound different. This conclusion does not negate the obvious observation that macroscopic differences, such as the size of the space key compared to standard keys, do contribute to the variation in sound.

**Figure 10: Results of Recognizing Two Keys Exchanged on the Keyboard**
- First 10 clicks: Produced by the "l" key element
- Next 10 clicks: Produced by the "k" key element
- Network trained to recognize "k" with 0 and "l" with 1 before the keys were exchanged

#### Testing the Third Hypothesis
To test the third hypothesis, we used a milling machine to cut out several pieces of the keyboard plate, each containing one key. This operation should render the third hypothesis irrelevant because it eliminates the positional context of the keys on the keyboard plate. If the third hypothesis were true, the network would not be able to distinguish between clicks produced by the keys mounted in these pieces. After training the network, it was unable to recognize the keys based on the test clicks (Figure 11), thus supporting our third hypothesis.

These experiments suggest that the clicks sound different primarily because the keys are positioned at different locations on the keyboard plate. Knocking at different positions on the plate produces different sounds. Neither microscopic differences between key elements nor the surrounding environment plays a significant role in the sound differences produced by different keys.

### Design Implications for Homophonic Keyboards
The construction of a homophonic keyboard, which produces indistinguishable clicks, should address the identified cause of sound variation. Possible solutions include:
- Not placing the keys on a single plate
- Using a material for the keyboard plate that does not conduct vibrations, thereby preventing the plate from acting as a "drum."

### Experiments on Different Input Devices

#### Notebook Keyboards, Telephone Pads, and ATM Pin Pads
We repeated the key recognition experiment for a notebook keyboard, a telephone pad, and an ATM pin pad. For the notebook keyboard, we tested the "k" and "l" keys. For the telephone and ATM pads, we tested keys "1" and "2."

**Figure 12: Results of Recognizing Two Keys on Various Devices**
- Notebook keyboard: Keys "k" and "l"
- Telephone and ATM pads: Keys "1" and "2"

The results show that the notebook keyboard, with 2 incorrect recognitions out of 20 clicks, is less vulnerable to the attack than a standard PC keyboard. Interestingly, all 20 test clicks from the telephone pad and the ATM pad were recognized correctly.

#### Multiple Telephone Pads
We also conducted an experiment with multiple telephone pads. We trained the network using one telephone pad and applied it to recognize clicks from other pads. The data in Table 4 shows the results in a similar format to Section 2.6.

**Table 4: Recognition Results for Multiple Telephone Pads**
- 90 test clicks per keypad, 10 clicks per key
- ADCS values: 1.03, 2.59, 4.08

Key findings:
- It is feasible to attack a telephone with a network trained on another telephone of the same type, but the quality of recognition is lower.
- The quality of recognition varies from pad to pad. For example, the clicks of telephone B are recognized better than those of telephone C.

### Summary
We explored acoustic emanations from keyboard-like input devices to recognize typed content. After detailing the basic attack on a PC keyboard, we successfully applied the attack to notebook keyboards, telephone pads, and ATM pads. A non-mechanical keyboard is a potential countermeasure, but it is neither comfortable nor cost-effective. We identified possible reasons for the slight sound differences and proposed preliminary designs for a homophonic mechanical keyboard. Further research could quantify environmental variables affecting the attack's success and investigate the vulnerability of other push-button devices.
