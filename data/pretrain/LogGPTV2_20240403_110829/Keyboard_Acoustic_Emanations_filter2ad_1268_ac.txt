test clicks of the l element as k (Figure 10).
This experiment led us to conclude that the second hy-
pothesis can be ruled out: The microscopic differences in
key elements play no or minor role in making the clicks to
sound different. This conclusion does not reject the obvious
observation that macroscopic differences play role in caus-
ing the keys to sound different. For example, the space key
may sound different from a standard key partially because
of the difference in size between the keys.
To check the third hypothesis we cut out several pieces
of the keyboard plate with one key in each piece using a
milling machine. Obviously, this operation should render
the third hypothesis irrelevant, because there is not any no-
tion of the position of the keys on the keyboard plate. If
the third hypothesis were true, we expect the network not to
be able to distinguish between clicks produced by the keys
mounted in these pieces. Indeed, after we trained the net-
work, the network was unable to recognize the keys based
on the test clicks (Figure 11), thus supporting our third hy-
pothesis.
These experiments suggest that the clicks sound differ-
ent because the keys are positioned at different positions
on the keyboard plate. Knocking at different positions on
the plate makes different sounds. Neither microscopic dif-
ferences between the key elements nor a surrounding envi-
ronment plays a signiﬁcant role in differences between the
sounds produced by different keys.

The construction of a homophonic keyboard should be
engineered to obliterate the above identiﬁed cause for keys
to sound differently. Possibilities include, for example, not
placing the keys in one plate, or producing the keyboard
plate from a material that does not conduct vibrations to
prevent the plate from acting as a “drum”.
4. Notebook Keyboards, Telephone Pads, and
ATM Pin Pads
We repeated the experiment of distinguishing between
two keys for a notebook keyboard, a telephone pad, and an
ATM pin pad. For the notebook keyboard the two keys were
again k and l. The telephone pad and the ATM pad were
tested with keys 1 and 2.

Table 4. Telephone pads A, B and C, all of
the same type, are attacked using a network
trained on the pad A. There are 90 test clicks
per keypad, 10 clicks per key.
The results are shown in Figure 12. With 2 incorrect
recognitions out of 20 clicks, the notebook keyboard shows
less vulnerability to the attack than the standard PC key-
board. Interestingly, all the 20 test clicks of the telephone
pad as well as all the 20 test clicks of the ATM pad were
recognized correctly.
4.1. Multiple telephone pads
We repeated the experiment described earlier for multi-
ple keyboards for telephone pads. Namely, we trained the
network using one telephone pad and applied this network
to recognize clicks of other pads.
The data in Table 4 is presented in the same format as in
Section 2.6. The results of this experiment are similar to the

results of the experiment with keyboards:
• It is feasible to attack a telephone with a network
trained on another telephone of the same type. How-
ever, the quality of recognition is lower compared to
the case where the network is trained on the same tele-
phone.
• The quality of recognition is different from pad to pad.
For example, the clicks of telephone B are recognized
considerably better than the clicks of telephone C.
5. Related Work
A Computerworld article [16] discusses the computer se-
curity in general, and suggests that “secrecy is an illusion”
by mentioning different exotic ways of breaking into the
systems. The “keyboard trick” is included as one of the ap-
proaches. Unfortunately, the author could not recall any ref-
erences for this “trick” [17].
TEMPEST documents NACSEM 5103, 5104, and 5105
are about acoustic emanations, but are (unfortunately) clas-
siﬁed according to the partially unclassiﬁed NACSIM 5000
[15]. This document also says that “Keyboards, printers,
relays – these produce sound, and consequently can be
sources of compromise”, while going no further beyond this
statement.
The authors of [20] observed that an eavesdropper can
collect timing information from the trafﬁc of an interactive
secure shell session. In particular, this timing information
reveals the delays between keys typed. The distribution of
the inter-keystroke delays differs slightly for different pairs
of keys. Thus, partial information about the identity of the
typed keys is revealed to an eavesdropper. The latency dis-
tributions for different key pairs highly overlap, so the in-
formation gain is relatively low. Moreover, different users
may demonstrate different inter-keystroke timings that fur-
ther reduces information gain. However, we can imagine
combining the timing analysis with the acoustic attack de-
scribed herein to make decisions about the key clicks that
were not unambiguously recognized based on the acous-
tic data alone. A related software–only timing attack is de-
scribed in [21].
Wireless keyboards can be eavesdropped by using an-
other receiving station. To prevent this disclosure, several
keyboard producers offer the keyboards with over-the-air
encryption.
Two attacks using electromagnetic emanations of the
keyboard are brieﬂy mentioned in [6]. The authors also ex-
plain how to counter them by modifying the keyboard de-
vice driver, and the ﬁrmware in the keyboard microcon-
troller. The emanations from the LEDs, in particular key-
board LEDs, are studied in [13]. The use of sounds emit-
ted by a Hagelin rotor machine for a side channel attack
has been documented in [22]. Acoustic emissions from ma-
trix printers were shown to be compromising in [7].
The authors of [9] tackle the problem of protecting the
users from thieves that use video camera or binoculars to
spy for the telephone card numbers and ATM pins remotely.
The suggested solution is to install an eye tracking system
at the terminals, so that the users use the motions of their
eyes to input the numbers.
6. Summary
We explored acoustic emanations of keyboard-like in-
put devices to recognize the content being typed. After pro-
viding a detailed description of the basic attack on a PC
keyboard, we successfully applied this attack to other types
of push button input devices, such as notebook keyboards,
telephone pads, and ATM pads.
A sound-free (non-mechanical) keyboard is an obvious
countermeasure for the attack. However, it is neither com-
fortable for users nor cheap. We identiﬁed possible rea-
sons that cause the keys to sound slightly different to draw
preliminary conclusions on how a homophonic mechanical
keyboard that produces indistinguishable clicks can be con-
structed.
The work presented in this paper points to many avenues
for further research. One can explore to quantify the envi-
ronmental variables under which the proposed attack can
succeed. One can also investigate the vulnerability of other
push button devices such as push button locks found on
many doors and push button garage door openers installed
in many houses. Only by measuring and analyzing the vul-
nerability of sound producing devices can we hope to de-
velop countermeasures and make them secure.
