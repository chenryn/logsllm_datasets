ing parameters. We use simple delta functions and logistic
functions to model the probability with which the defender
adopts a speciﬁc mitigation action based on her observed
network state. Note that the delta function δ(x) returns 1
if x is true or 0 otherwise. The cumulative density function
of the logistic distribution is Q(x; µ, s) = 1/(1 + e−(x−µ)/s).
Let Dbi, Dsb, Drl denote whether bandwidth inﬂation,
static blocking, and rate limiting is adopted, respectively.
We have:
d } = δ(Obf
d } = δ(Obf
d } = δ(Obf
d [1] ≥ tbi)
d [2] ≥ ts) · Q(Obf
d [2] ≥ ts) · Q(Obf
d [3]; µsb, ssb)
d [4]; µrl, srl)
 λ{Dbi = 1 | Obf
λ{Dsb = 1 | Obf
λ{Drl = 1 | Obf
That is to say, when the utilization level of the external link
exceeds threshold tbi, bandwidth inﬂation is enabled; only
when the server utilization level exceeds threshold ts, will
static blocking be enabled according to a logistic distribution
function Q(Obf
d [3]; µsb, ssb). Similarly, when the server uti-
lization level exceeds threshold ts, rate limiting is enabled ac-
cording to a logistic distribution function Q(Obf
d [4]; µrl, srl).
In our model, the defender samples D[1], D[2], and D[3]
in Equation (3) independently given Obf
d . If the defender
decides to perform bandwidth inﬂation (i.e., Dbi = 1), we
assume that she samples the fraction of increased bandwidth
uniformly from a set F; otherwise, D[1] is always 0. In the
case of static blocking, we note that D[2] = Dsb. Hence,
Equation (22) gives us λ{D[2] | Obf
d }. Similar to the case of
bandwidth inﬂation, we assume that the defender samples
an upper limit uniformly from set H when Drl = 1.
Utility functions. From the standpoint of the attacker,
his goal is to maximize the fraction of dropped transactions
from legitimate users’ traﬃc. Meanwhile, the attacker also
wants to minimize the number of bots used in the attack, as
he needs to pay the botherder for each bot used [4]. Hence,
a feasible utility function for the attacker is:
(cid:80)size(L)
k=1 L[k] −(cid:80)size(Xaf
(cid:80)size(L)
k=1 L[k] × A[1]
S [3])
k=1
ua =
X af
S [3][k]
,
(23)
which is the fraction of dropped legitimate users’ transac-
tions normalized by the number of bots used in the attack.
The reason that we incorporate the number of bots into
the attacker’s utility function is because botnets are usually
rented for malicious purposes such as DDoS attacks based on
the number of bots used [4]. Here, alternative utility func-
tions can also be applied, such as the diﬀerence between the
attacker’s gain (i.e., fraction of dropped legitimate traﬃc)
and his cost on paying bots (after proper scaling). Evalua-
tion of these diﬀerent utility functions remains as our future
work.
On the other hand, the defender values the fraction of
served legitimate users’ transactions. In the case of band-
width inﬂation, the defender may need to pay the fee for
increased bandwidth from the upstream ISP. Let the price
per increased fraction be ρ. We deﬁne the the defender’s
utility function ud as follows:
(cid:80)size(Xaf
(1 + ρD[1])(cid:80)size(L[k])
X af
S [3])
k=1
k=1
S [3][k]
L[k]
ud =
.
(24)
Note that in the Equation (24), the defender’s utility is nor-
malized by how much price he pays for the increased fraction
of external link’s bandwidth.
Level-0 distributions. To bootstrap the level-K think-
ing process, a player needs to make an assumption about
how her opponent behaves nonstrategically, i.e., at level 0.
From the defender’s viewpoint, we assume that she thinks
that there is no attack from the attacker. Similarly, we as-
sume that the attacker thinks that the defender does not
deploy any defense in advance. Hence, in our model, pa-
rameter K indicates the sophistication level of the player:
the higher K is, the more sophisticated a player’s strategic
thinking is.

In this section, we use the evaluation framework, imple-
mented with around 10,000 lines of C++ code, to analyze
scenarios with a single mitigation scheme deployed. Un-
derstanding the intricacies in games played when a single
defense scheme is put in place not only oﬀers us insights
into its strength and weakness against defending against

DDoS attacks, but also helps us understand later how the
entire defense system works when multiple defense schemes
are deployed simultaneously. To do so, we let Di where
i ∈ {bi, sb, rl} always be 0 in Equation (22) if the correspond-
ing defense scheme is not enabled. Table 2 summarizes the
parameter settings in the experiments. Due to space limi-
tation, we present only results for bandwidth inﬂation. For
each scenario, we average results from 500 simulation runs.
We consider only K = 1, 2 as when K > 2, it becomes too
computationally prohibitive. Fortunately, empirical studies
have suggested that people usually reason at only low levels.
For instance, K was observed to be mostly 1 or 2 in [16], or
almost always no greater than 3 in [1].
7.1 Decisions of attacker and defender
Decisions of the attacker and the defender under diﬀerent
bandwidth prices are shown in Figure 3, from which we make
the following observations.
Na¨ıve reasoning (K = 1): The number of bots and
the sending rate per bot do not change with the bandwidth
price ρ, because when K = 1, the attacker assumes that the
defender does not deploy any mitigation scheme, thereby
making the bandwidth price irrelevant. Moreover, when the
server capacity is low, the number of bots used by the at-
tacker is only 5000 (the lowest positive in set B), suggesting
that the small number of bots is suﬃcient for ﬂooding the
server. When the server capacity is high, the attacker needs
more bots to degrade the performance of the server, even
though the utility function of the attacker is inversely pro-
portional to the number of bots used. On the other hand,
the sending rate per bot chosen by the attacker is close to
the maximum value he can use in set K (i.e., 10 transactions
/ sec). This is because the utility function of the attacker
is not explicitly aﬀected by the sending rate per bot. Note
that when the server capacity is low, the sending rate per
bot is slightly lower than those when the server capacity is
higher. We conjecture that it is because the diﬀerence is
negligible when the server is overloaded.
By contrast, the defender’s decisions are aﬀected by the
bandwidth price. Albeit the defender assumes that there
is no attack, increasing the bandwidth of the external link
helps reduce the fraction of legitimate traﬃc dropped by
the external link due to congestion. With a higher band-
width price, the defender becomes more reluctant to increase
the bandwidth, which agrees with our intuition. When the
server capacity is lower, the defender has less incentive to
increase the bandwidth because the traﬃc, even passing
through the external link, would still be dropped by the over-
loaded server. Hence, we observe from Figures 3(3) that the
higher the server capacity is, the more likely the defender
will increase the bandwidth of the external link when the
bandwidth price is not high.
Sophisticated reasoning (K = 2). When K = 2, the
attacker uses only a small number of bots for attacks when
the server capacity is low, regardless of the bandwidth price.
However, when the server capacity is high, the attacker tends
to reduce the number of bots for attacks when the bandwidth
price increases. This is interesting because the bandwidth
price is only directly related to the defender’s decision (from
her utility function). Actually, when the bandwidth price in-
creases, the attacker ﬁgures that the defender is less likely to
increase the bandwidth of the external link, and as a result,
he tends to use a smaller number of bots for attacks. On the
other hand, when the server capacity increases, the attacker
ﬁgures that the defender tends to increase the bandwidth of
the external link by a higher fraction if the bandwidth price
is not high; hence, he has to use a larger number of bots to
achieve desired attack eﬀects. As in the cases when K = 1,
the attacker uses a high sending rate per bot for attacks.
From the defender’s side, with a higher bandwidth price,
she has less incentive to increase the bandwidth of the exter-
nal link. When the server capacity is high, not only does she
have the same incentive to increase the bandwidth of the ex-
ternal link as she does when K = 1, but also she also knows
that the attacker would use a higher number of bots for at-
tacks and is thus more willing to increase the bandwidth

Figure 4: Fraction of legitimate traﬃc served by critical resources vs. diﬀerent bandwidth prices under the
bandwidth inﬂation scheme (Server capacity: C)
of the external link unless the bandwidth price is high. We
thus observe from Figures 3(3) that the diﬀerences in the de-
fender’s decisions when K = 2 are prominent under diﬀerent
server capacities.
7.2 Outcomes of DDoS attack and defense games
The outcomes of the game under varying prices are illus-
trated in Figure 4. They show the fraction of legitimate
traﬃc that has been served by the external link and the
server before and after the mitigation scheme takes eﬀect,
respectively. We observe that when the server capacity is
low (Figures 4(1,4)), although the majority of legitimate
traﬃc (above 90%) passes through the external link, the
server only serves about 35% of legitimate traﬃc, regardless
of whether mitigation takes eﬀect. Under a low bandwidth
price, the defender decides to increase the bandwidth on
the external link, resulting that almost all legitimate traﬃc
passes through the external link (in both cases of K = 1 and
K = 2).
Medium/high server capacity, K = 1: When the server
capacity is 100,000, before mitigation takes eﬀect, about
56% of legitimate traﬃc passes through the external link
and is then served by the server, regardless of bandwidth
price; after mitigation takes eﬀect, the fraction of legitimate
traﬃc passing through the external link increases, leading
to more legitimate traﬃc served by the server. When the
server capacity reaches 500,000, all traﬃc passing through
the external link is served by the server. Also, both frac-
tions of legitimate traﬃc passing through the external link
and served by the server decrease with bandwidth price, as
the defender becomes more reluctant to add more bandwidth
to the external link with a higher bandwidth price.
Medium/high server capacity, K = 2: When the server ca-
pacity increases, both the fraction of legitimate traﬃc pass-
ing through the external link and then served by the server
before mitigation takes eﬀect increase as the bandwidth price
increases, because the attacker reduces the number of bots
used in the attack (see Figure 3(1)). From Figure 4(5),
we note that when the server capacity is 100,000, as band-
width price increases, the fraction of legitimate traﬃc pass-
ing through the external link ﬁrst decreases, then increases,
and ﬁnally decreases again. This interesting phenomenon
reﬂects mixed eﬀects from two factors. On one hand, as
bandwidth price increases, the attacker tends to reduce the
number of bots used in the attack (see Figure 3(1)). On the
