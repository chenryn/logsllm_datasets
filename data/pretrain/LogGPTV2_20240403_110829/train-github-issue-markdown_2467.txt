I don't really know how to classify this. Maybe just something that should be
documented.
I have a `postcss.config.js` file that returns a function (i.e takes `ctx` as
a parameter, returns a config object). That works fine in Next.js 9.1. But in
9.2, I get this error:
> Error: Your custom PostCSS configuration may not export a function. Please
> export a plain object instead.

Looking at the code for `plugin.ts`, this is obviously intentional behavior. I
tried to find this breaking change documented somewhere (e.g. release notes,
blog posts, etc.), but didn't find anything (the pull request with the change
does provide some context, but it's hard to find). I get it, new version,
things change. So possibly the only resolution to this is to document it
somewhere in the release notes, maybe explain why it's changed.
If it's helpful, this is what my postcss.config.js file looked like before.
Granted, what I'm using `ctx` for is probably unnecessary (sourcemaps seem to
be generated just fine using Next.js default behavior). So it's not a big deal
for me to get rid of it.
    module.exports = ctx => ({
        map: ctx.env === 'production' ? false : {inline: true},
