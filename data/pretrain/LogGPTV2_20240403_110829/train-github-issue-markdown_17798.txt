## Expected Behavior
run without any error
## Current Behavior
work good with `node server.js`  
but with: `next export` got error `Couldn't find a `pages` directory. Please
create one under the project root`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. move pages to `./src`
  2. create `server.js`
  3. add the code: `const app = next({ dev, dir: './src' });`
  4. run: `"export": "next export"`
