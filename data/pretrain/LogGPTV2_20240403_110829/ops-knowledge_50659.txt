User: How to realize port mapping and IP address binding of Docker container?
Assistant: Port mapping and IP address binding of a Docker container can be achieved in the following two ways: 1. Using the Docker command line parameters When creating a container, you can use the Docker command line parameters to map the port of the container to an IP address and IP address on the host port, as follows: docker run -p <host_ip>:<host_port>:<container_port> <image_name> where `<host_ip>` is the IP address on the host, and `<host_port>` is the port number on the host , `<container_port>` is the port number inside the container. For example, to map port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host and the NIC with IP address 192.168.0.100, you can use the following command: docker run -p 192.168.0.100:8080:80 nginx 2. Use the Docker Compose file If you need to create multiple containers and perform port mapping and IP address binding, you can use Docker Compose files for management. In a Docker Compose file, port mapping and IP address binding can be implemented using the following syntax: services: <service_name>: ports: - "<host_ip>:<host_port>:<container_port>" where `<service_name>` is the container `<host_ip>` is the IP address on the host, `<host_port>` is the port number on the host, and `<container_port>` is the port number inside the container. For example, the following is an example of port mapping and IP address binding using a Docker Compose file: version: '3.8' services: web: image: nginx ports: - "192.168.0.100:8080:80"
