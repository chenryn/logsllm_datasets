When adding something like the following to pubspec.yaml:
    flutter:
      assets:
        - ../../../../some_file
The flutter tool appends that full path to the `flutter_assets` directory path
and ends up writing the file outside of the `flutter_assets` directory(e.g to
`flutter_assets/../../../../some_file`).
Loading the asset at runtime fails.
