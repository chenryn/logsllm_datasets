Question: An incident responder notices that a particular piece of malware has been designed to exfiltrate recently modified files with certain extensions such as .doc, .xls, and .ppt from a compromised host. The malware selectively targets files based on their last modified timestamp and ignores all other files. Which of the following file discovery techniques does this behavior most closely resemble, and what is the rationale behind its selective nature?
"A": "Searching for files based on their extension, which can quickly identify potentially valuable data but may result in a large volume of less relevant files.",
"B": "Using a regular expression to locate configuration files, which may ensure that only specific types of files are targeted for exfiltration.",
"C": "Checking for specific folders to determine if the malware has run previously, which can minimize redundant data collection.",
"D": "Collecting recently changed files with specific extensions, which focuses on files that are likely to contain the most current and potentially sensitive information."
Answer: D
