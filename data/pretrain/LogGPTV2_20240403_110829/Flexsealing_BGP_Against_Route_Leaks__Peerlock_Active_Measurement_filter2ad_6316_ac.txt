updates both before and after the leak advertisement (i.e., for
the current and next target AS experiment). Additionally, we
repeat experiments - issue control/leak advertisements for the
same target ASes - over several months. These observations
are combined to reduce the "noise" of topological dynamism
from our inferences. Speciﬁcally, we remove ASes from
a target’s ﬁltering inference sets if we later observe them
propagating a leak update for that target; in this case, the
earlier inference was likely caused by the AS’s intermittent
presence in the observation window during the experiment.
Most importantly, we acknowledge that we cannot be certain
Peerlock/Peerlock-lite exactly as described by NTT [44], [18]
is responsible for all observed ﬁltering, but our experiments are
designed to avoid common leak ﬁltering systems. First, since
the leak and control advertisements in our experiments share
an origin AS/preﬁx, their updates present identically for ROV
ﬁltering purposes. Additionally, since we observe all ASes in
the control DAG propagating control updates, we infer those
ASes will not apply common IRR or max-preﬁx limit ﬁltering
to the same /24 in leak updates. Finally, while prior work
indicates that short poisoned paths are frequently present on
the control plane [49] and rarely ﬁltered [41], the poisoning
in the control advertisement ensures that we do not conﬂate
poison ﬁltering and Peerlocking.
Despite our efforts to avoid common ﬁltering practices,
local policies grant network operators extensive discretion in
how routes are vetted and exported. This ﬂexibility means we
cannot be certain that experimental updates are not sometimes
blocked by AS speciﬁc, ad-hoc AS PATH ﬁltering techniques.
We know of no way to distinguish such functionally similar
ﬁlters from Peerlock.
Ethics: We issued only well-formed BGP advertisements
using the PEERING software client and adhered to all rules
published by PEERING. We advertised only our assigned /24
preﬁxes, which are reserved for experimental use, and thus did
not disturb Internet control or data plane operation for any
non-experimental IP addresses. Our experiments did require
poisoned advertisements, but this is a common practice used
both in research [2], [41] and in trafﬁc engineering [49]. One
network operator observed and inquired about our experiments
to PEERING, but did not report any resultant adverse effects.
No data-plane trafﬁc was sent during the conduct of our
experiments.
B. Evaluation
Target Set 1, Tier 1s: The 19 Tier 1 ASes form our ﬁrst
target AS set, i.e. the potential protected ASes for which we
are inferring Peerlock rules. The Tier 1 peering clique includes
the most inﬂuential networks by one of the few observable
metrics, customer cone size [51], and often creates [27] or
distributes [23], [11], [40] leaks that disrupt global Internet
services. Paradoxically, deploying ﬁlters for leaks that include
Tier 1 ASes is also relatively simple for non-Tier 1 networks
via the Peerlock-lite system described above. We iteratively
issued unpoisoned, control, and leak advertisements that cov-
ered this set every two months from August 2019 to May
2020. This repetition allows us to capture ﬁltering rules for
ASes with inconsistent presence in our observation window,
and to explore how deployments change over time.
We ﬁrst present results for protection within the Tier 1
clique in Fig. 6. Note that because of BGP loop detection,
every AS ﬁlters leak updates that include their own ASN
regardless of Peerlock deployment. The peering clique is
fortunately the most stable feature in our observation window,
enabling us to measure the presence/absence of nearly every
potential Peerlock rule within the clique. We have marked
the exceptions for which we were unable to measure ﬁltering
rules in pink in Fig. 6. We see that Peerlock deployment is
signiﬁcant but unevenly distributed within the clique. Some
ASes - e.g. AS 2914 NTT, AS 701 Verizon - ﬁlter leak
updates for virtually the entire clique. For ﬁve others - e.g.
AS 3491 PCCW Global, AS 6762 Telecom Italia - we found
no evidence of Tier 1 Peerlock ﬁltering at all.

the experimental design described above, we cannot make
Peerlock protection inferences for ASes ﬁltering all poisoned
updates; however,
this is a small set without Tier 1/large
ISP members (max inference size = 9 ASes). Fig. 7 shows
the number of ASes in each UCLA class (see Section II)
protecting at least one Tier 1 target.
Target Set 2, Tier 1 Peers: Our second target set includes the
non-Tier 1 peers of Tier 1 ASes (about 600 ASes) as inferred
by CAIDA [51]. These experiments explore whether Tier 1
ASes are extending Peerlock protection to their non-Tier 1
peers. Additionally, despite covering about 1% of all ASes, this
set includes a third of all large ISPs. The presence of these
large ISPs in the target set allows us to investigate whether
non-Tier 1 ASes apply Peerlock-lite ﬁlters to large transit
networks outside the peering clique. These experiments were
conducted from Oct 2019 to May 2020, with every included
network targeted at least twice.
The overall results are presented in Fig. 8a. Clearly, ﬁltering
for these leaks is less prevalent within our observation window.
80% of Tier 1 peer leaks were ﬁltered by fewer than 2%
of observed ASes, but a few exceptional targets did trigger
signiﬁcant ﬁltering behavior. Our poison ﬁltering inference for
these targets is, as expected, nearly identical to that derived
from the Tier 1 leak experiments. Fig. 8b displays ﬁltering
levels for each Tier 1 ASes by peering status with the target.
All Tier 1s protect 10 or fewer peer networks from this set.
More variance exists in non-peer ﬁltering behavior, as we will
explore in the following discussion.
C. Discussion
Consistent with Smith et al. [41], we ﬁnd no evidence
for widespread ﬁltering of otherwise unremarkable poisoned
paths. Their study also found that poisoning high degree
ASes in an update is associated with reduced propagation.
8
Speciﬁcally, sub-20% update propagation rates were observed
for some Tier 1 ASes, including AS 174 (Cogent/Tier 1)
and AS 3356 (Level 3/Tier 1). Birge-Lee et al. [2] likewise
found that using AS poisoning rather than communities as
a path export control primitive signiﬁcantly reduced update
spread, especially when large transit providers were poisoned.
Defensive AS-path
(e.g.,Peerlock/Peerlock-lite)
is identiﬁed as a likely culprit for this effect. Our work
systematically examines how and where these ﬁlters are
deployed on the control plane (within the limits of our
observation window).
ﬁltering
Tier 1 Leak Filtering: The greatest protection within our
observation window is clearly afforded to Tier 1 ASes. Our
initial experiments in August 2019 discovered evidence for
133/342 (192− 19) possible Tier 1-Tier 1 ﬁltering rules (about
39%). Each measurement that followed uncovered at least
two new ﬁltering rules, and by our ﬁnal experiment in May
2020, 153 rules had been observed, a nearly 15% uptick in
Peerlock deployment. We had previously observed a negative
ﬁltering result for every additional rule, indicating this increase
results from genuinely new Peerlock deployments rather than
instability in the observation window.
Non-Tier 1 ASes also ﬁlter Tier 1 leaks,
though this
behavior is far from uniform. Overall, Tier 1 leak ﬁltering
ranged from 3% to 15% of observed ASes across Tier 1 AS
targets. Most of this is likely due to Peerlock-lite ﬁltering, as
it is simpler to deploy. Moreover, fewer than 10% of the more
than 1,000 observed Tier 1 ﬁltering rules exist between peers,
and only about 20% (236 rules) involved a Tier 1’s indirect
customers ﬁltering leak updates. This suggests that ASes are
installing Peerlock-lite ﬁlters for all Tier 1s rather than simply
protecting their upstream providers.

tices (like AS path ﬁltering) to secure inter-domain routing.
While Peerlock and Peerlock-lite are not speciﬁcally included
in MANRS expected ﬁltering actions, they are both suggested
in the implementation guide [5]. Fig.9 displays as a CDF the
proportion of MANRS and non-MANRS ASes ﬁltering Tier
1 leaks. 73 of 502 MANRS ASes fall within our observation
window; the proportion of observed MANRS ASes that ﬁltered
Tier 1 leaks ranged from 2-18% depending on Tier 1 target.
Non-MANRS ﬁltering over the same target set ranged from 2
to 12%.

associated with differing responses to BGP events [41], [3].
This dynamic hampers systems requiring wide participation
like ROV [8] and IRR ﬁltering [22], but does not
limit
Peerlock or Peerlock-lite deployment.
Tier 1 Peer Leak Filtering: Our non-Tier 1 leak experi-
ments met with relatively sporadic ﬁltering. For more than
80% of targets in this set, nearly every observation window
AS (>=98%) propagated leaks. As described in Section III,
Peerlock-lite ﬁlters for non-Tier 1 ASes require more careful
deployment. The outliers in this target set (see the long tail
in Fig. 8a) are invariably near-Tier 1 networks like AS 1273
Vodafone, AS 6939 Hurricane Electric, and AS 7843 Charter
9
that are safe for most ASes to include in a Peerlock-lite ﬁlter.
Tier 1 ﬁltering of this leak set was likewise reduced com-
pared to Tier 1 leaks. In general, Tier 1 networks deploy
fewer than 5 Peerlock ﬁlters for non-clique peers. Nearly
all of these cover near-Tier 1s like AS 7922 Comcast and
AS 1273 Vodafone, or ASes administered by Tier 1s e.g.
AS 702/703 Verizon and AS 3549 Level 3. Notably, three
networks extend protection to more than 15 non-peers (per
CAIDA’s inference). AS 2914 NTT’s non-peer ﬁltering rules
all cover various Comcast ASNs, while AS 12956 Telefonica’s
rules appear to be regionally-based: zero rules are applied to
customer cone ASes, but 23/31 apply to other European ISPs
of varying size. 13/20 of AS 3320 Deutsche Telecom’s non-
peer ﬁltering rules, on the other hand, cover ASes within its
customer cone.
In summary, Peerlock is widely deployed and expanding
within the peering clique. Deployment outside the peering
clique is relatively limited, however. Up to 20% of non-clique
networks also deploy Peerlock-lite (or a similar mechanism)
to ﬁlter leaks containing Tier 1 or near-Tier 1 ASes. These
deployments are proportionally more common in ISPs and
rarely seen in stub ASes within our observation window. Fortu-
nately, the effectiveness of Peerlock/Peerlock-lite deployments
is less sensitive to scattershot deployment than other ﬁltering
solutions. Prior work [8] and our simulations in the following
Section V suggest that ﬁltering by large ISPs can have an
outsize impact on global leak propagation.
topic [38], [37], [42], [49]. We construct a simulated AS-
level
topology from CAIDA’s inferred relationship dataset
(Jan. 2020 data) [51]. ASes within the topology evaluate
and export routes using the BGP decision process; longest-
preﬁx matching, LOCAL PREF, and AS PATH guide path
selection, while route export is governed by local policy to
enforce valley-free routing. This ensures the simulator models
the central dynamic of control plane propagation - the Gao-
Rexford model [7], and allows for the closest approximation
of control plane behavior we can devise without ASes’ full
(private) routing policies.
Each simulation is driven by a protection scenario that
maps protector ASes to those they are protecting. As with
Peerlock in practice, these protectors drop all received routes
that transit a protected AS unless they arrive directly from that
AS. Some scenarios also include Peerlock-lite deployments;
for these experiments, some set of ASes ﬁlter all customer-
exported routes that transit Tier 1 ASes. Once we establish the
protection scenario, we iterate over all Tier 1 to Tier 1 links
(with 19 Tier 1 ASes, this is n = 19, n2 − n = 342 links).
These links describe a unidirectional connection from one Tier
1, called the link start, to another Tier 1, called the link end.
For every link in this set, we sample 20 ASes from the link
start’s customer cone to serve as leakers. Each leaker will,
in turn, randomly select a destination AS in the link end’s
customer cone, and advertise a route to the destination over
the link to all of its peers/providers (see Fig. 10). This models
a Type 1 route leak of a path over the peering clique [45]. After
the leak, we allow the topology to converge and measure how
many ASes 1) received leak updates and 2) installed the leak
path. Additionally, we capture all the AS PATH of all leak
updates for analysis. With 20 leaker/destination pairings per
link and 342 Tier 1 links, we simulate 6,840 leaks in total.

V. EXPLORING PEERLOCK’S PRACTICAL IMPACT
The substantial but limited Peerlock/Peerlock-lite ﬁltering
measured in the previous section leads us to investigate these
systems’ protective beneﬁt in partial deployment. We have
interest both in how well these systems protect the control
plane from Tier 1 leaks as deployed, and in the relative
effect of realistic additional deployment (e.g. adding ﬁlters
at
large transit networks). To answer these questions, we
quantify Peerlock’s practical impact with Internet-scale leak
simulations against several ﬁlter deployment schemes.
A. Simulation Methodology
These experiments are conducted via extensions to a BGP
simulator, an approach consistent with prior work on this
Fig. 10: Example simulated leak. Dashed red lines indicate
route leak to other providers/peers.
Our simulations focus on leaks with Tier 1 leaks for
two reasons. First, we do not ﬁnd substantial real-world
Peerlock/Peerlock-lite protection of non-Tier 1 ASes as out-
lined in Section IV. Second, many consequential leaks are
propagated globally over the Tier 1 backbone, e.g. [27], [23],
[40], [11]. Some of our protection schemes will investigate
whether leaks can propagate throughout the Internet without
Tier 1 distribution.

B. Evaluation
We evaluate seven different protection schemes for Tier 1
leaks.
• No ﬁlters.
• Inferred: Tier 1 Peerlock levels observed during Internet
measurements.
• Full T1: All Tier 1s Peerlock for all other Tier 1s.
• Full T1 + large ISP lock: Same as full T1, but all
large ISPs (376 ASes in CAIDA Jan 2020 dataset [51])
Peerlock their Tier 1 peers.
• Full T1 + large ISP lite: Same as full T1, but all large
ISPs deploy Peerlock-lite to protect clique ASes.
• Full T1 + large ISP both: Same as full T1, but all large
ISPs deploy Peerlock-lite ﬁlters and Peerlock for their
Tier 1 peers.
• Inferred + large ISP lite: Same as inferred, but all large
ISPs deploy Peerlock-lite.
While it
is simpler to ﬁlter customer-learned routes with
Peerlock-lite than to deploy Tier 1 Peerlock ﬁlters for large
ISPs, we include both Peerlock and Peerlock-lite ﬁltering by
these ASes to study how leaks are propagated within the
topology. The results of these experiments are presented in
Fig. 11, which displays both the proportion of ASes in the
topology receiving leak updates (Fig. 11a), and the proportion
selecting/exporting the leak path (Fig. 11b).
A critical feature revealed by Fig. 11 is the insufﬁciency of
Tier 1 protection alone (blue lines). Full Tier 1 Peerlocking
