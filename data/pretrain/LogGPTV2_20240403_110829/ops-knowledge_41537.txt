User: Please list some cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to malware, DDoS attacks, and phishing. At the same time, provide corresponding coping strategies.
Assistant: 1. Malicious software: including viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, etc., they will attack your computer system, data files, steal your information, and even control your computer. Countermeasures: Regularly update anti-virus software and operating system patches, do not open files from unknown sources, do not download/install unknown software at will, and back up important data. 2. DDoS attack: Distributed denial of service attack, which simulates a large number of user visits to cause exhaustion of system resources and paralyze websites or services. Countermeasures: Configure firewalls, traffic cleaning devices, limit the number of concurrent connections, cooperate with operators to implement traffic filtering, and back up important data, etc. 3. Phishing: Spoofing by forging trusted emails, links or information to trick users into disclosing their personal information so that it can be illegally used and stolen. Countermeasures: Do not open unknown links and attachments, do not trust information from unknown sources, be highly vigilant for information that may be a phishing attack, etc. 4. Zero-day attacks: Attacks on undisclosed vulnerabilities, often exposing sensitive data by accessing unauthorized functions or privileges. Countermeasures: Conduct frequent vulnerability scans on organizational systems, install system updates and patches as soon as possible, and establish a vulnerability repair system. 5. Wireless network intrusion: Hackers attack and intrude your network security through wireless network technology. This kind of attack is more dangerous. Countermeasures: enable WPA2-level encryption, prohibit open wireless networks, prohibit enabling WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Settings), authenticate and authorize 802.1X, etc. 6. Data leakage: Leaking sensitive data to unauthorized personnel or organizations will lead to data security issues and seriously affect corporate brand reputation. Countermeasures: Strengthen employee security awareness training, establish a data authority protection mechanism, etc. 7. Social engineering attack: Hackers use social skills to obtain the password and key information of the target account, and deceive the target by accessing selective or revealing sensitive information. Coping strategies: establish a comprehensive awareness of information security, identify common means of hackers (such as: deception, disguise, threats and confusion, etc.), etc.
