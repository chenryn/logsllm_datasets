User: You have an Nginx server and need to configure reverse proxy and load balancing, how to configure it?
Assistant: To configure Nginx reverse proxy and load balancing, the following steps are required: 1. Install Nginx and set up basic configurations. 2. Define a load balancer and a set of backend servers using the "upstream" directive. ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example.com weight=5; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; } ``` 3. Create a reverse proxy configuration file on the server to forward the request to the load balancer. ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } ``` 4. Save and restart the Nginx server for the changes to take effect. ``` sudo service nginx restart ``` After completing these steps, your Nginx server will start using a load balancing algorithm to distribute incoming requests across a set of backend servers. Additionally, the server will forward these requests to selected backend servers using a reverse proxy.
