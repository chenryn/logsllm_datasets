User: I want my directory, and all its sub directories and files, to go straight to S3. Clone it.
Is there an easy script/program to do that?
I'm on Ubuntu linux.
Assistant: Install S3 (http://s3tools.org/download) 
Configure it:
s3cmd --configure
Create a bucket: s3cmd mb s3://my-bucket (alternatively, you can do this via a tool like S3Fox) 
Sync your local directory with S3: s3cmd sync /path/to/local/dir/ s3://my-bucket
