Report a bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
My bundle gets compiled several times.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
I'm creating a webpack boilerplate for my personal projects, you can check it
on this repo on the `cleanup` branch
https://github.com/alejandronanez/webpack-boilerplate/tree/cleanup
  1. `npm start`
  2. Add a few lines to `src/styles/app.scss` \- a few empty new lines will do the trick
  3. CTRL + C to stop the process
  4. `npm start` again
  5. You should start seeing the bundle compiles on a loop for a while, and then it will stop
Here's a GIF with what is happening:

**What is the expected behavior?**
The looping should not occur.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**
