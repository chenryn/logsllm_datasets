### Feature Request

**Summary:**
Add an option to disable the automatic reopening of files that were not closed in the previous session (within the same project).

**Current Behavior:**
Atom automatically reopens files that were not closed in the last session when you start the editor within the same project.

**Desired Behavior:**
Introduce a configurable setting that allows users to disable this feature, so no additional files are opened when Atom starts.

**Context:**
Currently, there is a workaround for this, but a built-in, configurable setting would be more appropriate and user-friendly.

**Environment:**
- **Atom Version:** 0.198.0
- **Operating System:** Linux

**Additional Notes:**
Thank you for considering this feature request.
