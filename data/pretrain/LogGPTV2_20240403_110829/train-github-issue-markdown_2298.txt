**Feature request** for the opposite of #1603 (not to reverse it, but to add
an option to disable it).
**Currently:** Atom will reopen files that were not closed from last time
(within the same project)  
**Desired:** An option to disable this, so that no additional files are opened
when Atom starts
There is currently a hack for this, however, a configurable setting would be
much more appropriate.
**Using:** Atom 0.198.0 on Linux
Thanks
