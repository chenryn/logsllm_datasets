User: I download python 3.2 and my first thought was that I need to uninstall the python 2.6.1 pre-installed in my computer. But later I found in python.org "You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software". I used "sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework" to delete python 2.6.1. Now I truly want to undo this command(I want python 2.6.1 back!). What should I do?
(or the question can be expressed as follows: how can I re-install the pre-installed python 2.6.1 in my mac?)
Assistant: Reinstalling would work. In the future, don't delete Frameworks you didn't install.
