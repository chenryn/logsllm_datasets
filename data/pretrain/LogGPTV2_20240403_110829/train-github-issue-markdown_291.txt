I think, it would be nice to define `isa(T)` to return a curried version,
because it's consistent with similar functions like `in` and often useful in
`any` or `all`. It's a builtin function, so this would probably require some
small changes, but it's already possible to shadow `isa` locally, so I believe
this should be doable.
