### About Me
- **Role:** Senior Information Security Consultant at TrustedSec
- **Co-Founder:** Derbycon ([derbycon.com](http://www.derbycon.com))
- **Interests:** Information Security Education
- **Note:** I don't claim to know everything; I'm just a geek with some time on my hands.

### Perspectives
In this discussion, I will be taking two perspectives:
1. People trying to stay anonymous
2. People trying to de-anonymize users

**Disclaimer:**
- I am not a privacy expert.
- IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer)
- Be cautious about where you surf; contraband is easily accessible.

---

### Darknets
**Definition:**
- An "anonymizing private network" that uses encryption and proxies (sometimes other peers) to obscure who is communicating with whom.
- Sometimes referred to as "Cipherspace" (a term I particularly like).

---

### The Onion Router (Tor)
**Who?**
- Initially developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, then supported by the EFF, and now maintained by the Tor Project (a 501(c)(3) non-profit).
- **Website:** [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/)

**Why?**
- Tor is free software and an open network that helps defend against network surveillance, protecting personal freedom, privacy, confidential business activities, relationships, and state security through traffic analysis.

**What?**
- Access normal Internet sites anonymously and use Tor hidden services.

**How?**
- Uses a locally run SOCKS proxy that connects to the Tor network.
- Features layered encryption, bidirectional tunnels, and directory servers.
- Primarily focused on out-proxying to the Internet.
- **More Info:** [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/)

**Components:**
- **Client:** Just a user.
- **Relays:** Relay traffic and can act as exit points.
- **Bridges:** Relays not advertised in the directory servers, making them harder to block.
- **Guard Nodes:** Used to mitigate some traffic analysis attacks.
- **Introduction Points:** Helpers in making connections to hidden services.
- **Rendezvous Points:** Used for relaying/establishing connections to hidden services.

### Pros and Cons of Tor
**Pros:**
- If you can tunnel it through a SOCKS proxy, you can make almost any protocol work.
- Three levels of proxying, with each node not knowing the one before last, provide strong anonymity.

**Cons:**
- Slow performance.
- Trust issues with exit nodes.
- Semi-fixed infrastructure: For example, on September 25, 2009, the Great Firewall of China blocked 80% of Tor relays listed in the Directory, but bridges helped mitigate this.
- It's relatively easy to tell someone is using Tor from the server side.

**Default Ports:**
- **Local:**
  - 9050/tcp: Tor SOCKS proxy
  - 9051/tcp: Tor control port
  - (9150 and 9151 on Tor Browser Bundle)
- **Remote:**
  - 443/tcp and 80/tcp mostly
  - Servers may also listen on port 9001/tcp, and directory information on 9030.

### Case Study: Bomb Threat at Harvard
- On December 16, 2013, a bomb threat was made to Harvard’s student newspaper and some officials.
- The person used [guerrillamail.com](https://www.guerrillamail.com) to send the email after connecting over Tor.
- GuerrillaMail added an X-Originating-IP header, which marked the sender as a Tor exit point.

**Email Content:**
```
To: "PI:EMAIL"
From: 
Subject: Hey baby!
X-Originating-IP: [74.128.28.74]
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="uy@8"

shrapnel bombs placed in:  
science center  
sever hall  
emerson hall  
thayer hall  
2/4.  
guess correctly.   
be quick for they will go off soon
```

- All Tor nodes are publicly known (except bridges): [torstatus.blutmagie.de](http://torstatus.blutmagie.de)
- It was easy to correlate who was attached to the Harvard network and using Tor at the same time the email was sent (unless a bridge was used).
- Eldo Kim was connected to the Tor network around that time.
- Suspect Eldo Kim admitted to making the bomb threat to get out of a final exam.

- [scribd.com/doc/192371742/Kim@El@Do@Harvard](https://www.scribd.com/doc/192371742/Kim@El@Do@Harvard)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Don’t be the only person using Tor on a monitored network at a given time.
- Consider using a bridge.
- Avoid admitting anything.
- Correlation attacks are a significant risk.

### DNS Queries and Monitoring
- If you don’t use the proxy for DNS, you may send the query to a DNS server, which won’t see your traffic to/from the destination but may now know you are visiting someplace.com/.onion/.i2p.

### Case Study: Hector Xavier Monsegur (Sabu)
- Normally used Tor for connecting to IRC but was caught not using it once, and the FBI found his home IP.
- After being caught, he started to collaborate.
- Spoke with Jeremy Hammond (sup_g) on IRC, and Jeremy casually mentioned where he had been arrested before and groups he was involved with.
- This narrowed the suspect pool, leading to a court order to monitor his Internet access.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Use Tor consistently.
- Avoid giving personal information.
- Correlation attacks remain a significant risk.
