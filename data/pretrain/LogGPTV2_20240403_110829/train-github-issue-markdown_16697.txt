  * I tried using the `@types/request` package and had problems.
Latest release seems to have added a duplicate 'time' identifier to the
CoreOptions interface
    node_modules/@types/request/index.d.ts(146,9): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'time'.
    node_modules/@types/request/index.d.ts(157,9): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'time'.
  * Mention the authors (see `Definitions by:` in `index.d.ts`) so they can respond.
