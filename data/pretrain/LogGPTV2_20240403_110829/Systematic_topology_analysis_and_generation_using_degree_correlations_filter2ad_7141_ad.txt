to obtain 2K-random graphs. To produce 3K-random grap-
hs, we apply 3K-targeting 2K-preserving rewiring to the
2K-random graphs obtained in the previous step.
5.2 Topology Comparisons
We next test the convergence of our dK-series for the skit-
ter and HOT graphs. Since all dK-graph constructing algo-
rithms yield consistent results, we selected the simplest one,
the dK-randomizing rewiring from Section 4.1.4, to obtain
dK-random graphs in this section.
The number of possible initial dK-randomizing rewirings
is a good preliminary indicator of the size of the dK-graph
space. We show these numbers for the HOT graph in Ta-
ble 5. If we discard rewirings leading to obvious isomorphic
graphs, cf. Section 4.1.4, then the number of possible initial
rewirings is even smaller.
We compare the skitter topology with its dK-random coun-
terparts, d = 0, . . . , 3, in Table 6 and Figure 6. We report
all the metrics calculated for the giant connected compo-
nent (GCCs). Minor discrepancies between values of av-
erage degree ¯k and r result from GCC extractions.
If we
do not extract the GCC, then ¯k is the same as that of the
original graph for all d = 0, . . . , 3, and r is exactly the same
for d > 1.
We do not show degree distributions for brevity. How-
ever, degree distributions match when considering the entire
graph and are very similar for the GCCs for all d > 0. When
d = 0, the degree distribution is binomial, as expected.
We see that all other metrics gradually converge to those
in the original graph as d increases. A value of d = 1 pro-
vides a reasonably good description of the skitter topology,
while d = 2 matches all properties except clustering. The
3K-random graphs are identical to the original for all met-
rics we consider, including clustering.
We perform the 2K-space explorations described in Sec-
tion 4.3 to check if d = 2 is indeed suﬃciently constraining
for the skitter topology. We observe small variations of clus-
tering ¯C, second-order likelihood S2, and spectrum, shown
in Table 7 and Figure 7. All other metrics do not change, so
we do not show plots for them. We conclude that d = 2, i.e.,
the joint degree distribution provides a reasonably accurate
description of observed AS-level topologies.
The HOT topology is more complex than AS-level topolo-
gies. Earlier work argues that this topology cannot be ac-
curately modeled using degree distributions alone [19]. We
therefore selected the HOT topology graph as a diﬃcult case
for our approach.
A preliminary inspection of visualizations in Figure 3 indi-
cates that the dK-series converges at a reasonable rate even
for the HOT graph. The 0K-random graph is a classical ran-
dom graph and lacks high-degree nodes, as expected. The
1K-random graph has all the high-degree nodes we desire,
but they are crowded toward the core, a property absent in
