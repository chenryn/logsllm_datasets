User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there a ProxyPass equivalent for IIS? I need to redirect one SSL site to another SSL site.

For example, I control https://sitea.michael.com but I want the traffic there to be forwarded to https://siteb.notinmycontrol.com

I don't control the DNS on notinmycontrol.com and anyway there's no way for them to install a michael.com cert on their servers.

If I'm running an Apache server, this works via mod_proxy and mod_ssl

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName sitea.michael.com
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        SSLProxyEngine on
        ProxyPass / https://siteb.notinmycontrol.com/
        ProxyPassReverse / https://siteb.notinmycontrol.com/

        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
        LogLevel warn

        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
        ServerSignature On
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


Is there an equivalent way to do this if I'm running an IIS server?

Assistant: If you are on IIS 7 or higher, you should be able to use ARR as a reverse proxy.
