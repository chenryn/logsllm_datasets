We are using EC2 auto-scaling. It turns out that our airflow machines are on
the autoscaled EC2 instances, resulting in multiple machines launching
schedulers with LocalExecutors. Is this a design pattern that is dangerous?
We originally worked around this using EC2 "user-data" scripts that fire after
an EC2 auto-scaled instances is launched -- the "user-data" script kills the
scheduler processes. However, we suspect that some of these schedulers pick up
duplicate work and execute them before they are killed.
Hence, I am wondering how the scheduler with local executor works in a
topology with schedulers running on multiple machines.
