User: Set up SSH remote connection for a remote server and assign different permissions to different users.
Assistant: The following are the steps to set up remote server SSH remote connection: 1. Make sure the remote server has installed OpenSSH server. If it is not installed, install it with the following command: ``` sudo apt-get install openssh-server ``` 2. For better security, disable root login for SSH. Edit the SSH configuration file: ``` sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config ``` Find and change the line "PermitRootLogin yes" to "PermitRootLogin no". 3. Restart the SSH server: ``` sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart ``` 4. Make sure the firewall allows SSH connections. If you are using an Ubuntu server, you can use the following command to allow SSH: ``` sudo ufw allow ssh ``` To assign different permissions to different users: 1. Create an account for each user on the server. For example, to add user "bob", use the following command: ``` sudo adduser bob ``` 2. Disable password login for the new user (if you want that user to be able to authenticate only with SSH keys): `` ` sudo passwd -l bob ``` 3. To create an SSH key for each user, use the following command: ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 ``` Copy the public key to "authorized_keys" on the server ‚Äù file for use during authentication. 4. Make sure each user has access only to their home directory and the files they need. A "chroot" can be used to restrict access. For example, to restrict user "bob" to only have access to his home directory, execute the following command: ``` sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config ``` Add the following lines: ``` Match User bob ChrootDirectory /home/bob X11Forwarding no AllowTcpForwarding no ForceCommand internal-sftp ``` 5. Restart the SSH server: ``` sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart ``` You have now successfully set up remote connections via A user is assigned the appropriate permissions.
