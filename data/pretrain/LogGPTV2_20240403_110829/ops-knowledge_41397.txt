User: How to configure the ACL (Access Control List) of the network device to restrict the user's access rights?
Assistant: To configure the ACL of the network device to restrict the user's access, you can follow the steps below: 1. Determine the target address that needs to restrict access, such as a specific IP address or subnet. 2. Create ACL rules to control access to the selected destination addresses. ACL rules can be matched based on conditions such as source IP address, destination IP address, port number, and protocol. 3. Further refine the ACL rules to define access rights. ACL rules can allow or deny specific types of access, limit bandwidth, or prevent specific types of attacks. 4. Configure ACL rules on network devices. Configuration can be done through CLI commands or web interface. 5. Test that the ACL rules work as expected. These include testing whether a specific user or device can access a target address and verifying that ACL rules are applied correctly. You can also use third-party software for tests such as simulated attacks.
