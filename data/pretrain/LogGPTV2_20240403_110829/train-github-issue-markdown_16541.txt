    Python 3.10.9
    Arch Linux
### Detailed description
`VideoWriter` fails silently when the size of the frame passed to
`VideoWriter().write()` differs from the `frameSize` specified in the
constructor.
I would expect an error, but instead, the written video will not play, which
is hard to trace back to a frame size issue.

### Steps to reproduce
    import cv2
    FPS = 30
    KEY_ESC = 27
    OUTPUT_FILE = "vid.mp4"
    cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    codec = cv2.VideoWriter.fourcc(*"mp4v") # MPEG-4 http://mp4ra.org/#/codecs
    frame_size = cam.read()[1].shape[:2] # wrong (see SO link)
    video_writer = cv2.VideoWriter(OUTPUT_FILE, codec, FPS, frame_size)
    # record until user exits with ESC
    while True:
        success, image = cam.read()
        cv2.imshow("window", image)
        video_writer.write(image)
        if cv2.waitKey(5) == KEY_ESC:
            break
### Issue submission checklist
  * I report the issue, it's not a question
  * I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues, forum.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found any solution
  * I updated to the latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there
  * There is reproducer code and related data files (videos, images, onnx, etc)
