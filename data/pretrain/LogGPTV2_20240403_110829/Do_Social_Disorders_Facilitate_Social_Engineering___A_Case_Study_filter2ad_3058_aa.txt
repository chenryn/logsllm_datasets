## Abstract
Social engineering is a well-documented and extensively studied threat, particularly against typical computer users. However, the vulnerability of individuals with medical conditions to such attacks remains underexplored. This paper investigates the susceptibility of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to phishing, a prominent form of social engineering. ASD, characterized by impaired social skills and communication, may make these individuals more vulnerable to deception. Our study involved 15 participants diagnosed with ASD and 15 without, who were asked to distinguish real websites from their fake counterparts. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants with ASD did not show increased vulnerability to phishing. We attribute this result to their unique characteristics, such as attention to detail, strong memory for factual information, and diverse thinking, which are often seen as advantageous in cybersecurity. Our findings suggest that targeted phishing attacks on individuals with ASD may not be more successful than untargeted attacks on the general population, highlighting that social disorders do not necessarily facilitate social engineering.

## 1. Introduction
Phishing is a form of social engineering where attackers create fake websites that mimic legitimate ones to steal sensitive information. Extensive research has been conducted on the susceptibility of typical users to phishing, but little is known about how individuals with medical conditions, particularly those with social disorders, fare. For instance, a recent study by Oliveira et al. found that older adults may be more susceptible to spear-phishing attacks. Understanding the vulnerabilities of specific populations can help in developing tailored security measures.

In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to phishing. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. The increasing prevalence of ASD means that more individuals with ASD are transitioning into adulthood and facing new challenges, including the need to discern the intentions of others. Given the known gullibility and social vulnerability of individuals with ASD, we hypothesized that they would be more susceptible to phishing attacks. 

Our study involved 15 participants with ASD and 15 without, who were asked to distinguish real websites from fake ones. Contrary to our expectations, participants with ASD performed no worse than those without. We attribute this to their unique traits, such as attention to detail, methodical thinking, and strong memory for factual information. These findings suggest that targeted phishing attacks on individuals with ASD may not be more successful than untargeted attacks on the general population.

## 2. Background and Prior Work
### 2.1. Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. The prevalence of ASD has increased significantly, from 1 in 88 children in 2008 to 1 in 68 in 2014. As children with ASD transition into adulthood, they face new challenges, including the ability to discern the intentions of others.

### 2.2. Related Work
Several studies have examined the susceptibility of typical users to phishing attacks, focusing on task performance and the effectiveness of anti-phishing tools. For example, Dhamija et al. (2006) and Egelman et al. (2010) conducted studies on the effectiveness of phishing warnings. However, these studies focused on the general population. Recent research has begun to explore specific populations, such as older adults and journalists, but there is a gap in understanding the susceptibility of individuals with ASD.

Studies on deception and gullibility in individuals with ASD have shown that they are more trusting and easily deceived than their typically developing peers. This vulnerability can be harmful in various contexts, including school-age relationships and bullying. However, our study suggests that individuals with ASD may not be as susceptible to phishing attacks as previously thought, possibly due to their attention to detail and methodical thinking.

## 3. Study Design
Our study aimed to understand how individuals with ASD react to phishing websites. We designed a phishing detection task where participants were asked to distinguish real websites from fake ones. We selected popular websites from the top 100 Alexa rankings, such as Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Facebook, and Citibank, and created visually similar fake versions. Participants were then asked to identify the real and fake websites, and we analyzed their performance and decision-making processes.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1. Participants
We recruited 15 participants diagnosed with ASD and 15 without ASD. All participants were matched for age, gender, and internet usage. The participants with ASD were recruited through local support groups and clinics, while the control group was recruited through university and community channels.

### 4.2. Task Design
The task involved presenting participants with pairs of websites, one real and one fake, and asking them to identify the real website. The fake websites were designed to closely mimic the real ones, with subtle differences in the URL, security indicators, and visual elements. Participants were given a brief tutorial on how to identify phishing websites before starting the task.

### 4.3. Data Collection
We collected quantitative data on the number of correct and incorrect identifications and qualitative data through post-task questionnaires. The questionnaires included questions about the participants' thought processes and the cues they used to make their decisions.

## 5. Results
### 5.1. Quantitative Analysis
Contrary to our hypothesis, participants with ASD performed similarly to those without ASD in identifying real and fake websites. Both groups had a high accuracy rate, with no significant difference between the two groups.

### 5.2. Qualitative Analysis
Qualitative analysis of the post-task questionnaires revealed that participants with ASD paid close attention to details such as missing security locks, logos, and obfuscated URLs. They also reported using methodical approaches to verify the authenticity of the websites.

## 6. Discussion
Our results suggest that individuals with ASD may not be more vulnerable to phishing attacks than the general population. Their unique traits, such as attention to detail and methodical thinking, may help them in identifying phishing attempts. This finding challenges the assumption that individuals with ASD are more susceptible to deception and highlights the importance of considering individual strengths in designing security measures.

## 7. Conclusion
This study provides the first empirical evidence on the susceptibility of individuals with ASD to phishing attacks. Our findings suggest that targeted phishing attacks on individuals with ASD may not be more successful than untargeted attacks on the general population. Future research should further explore the unique strengths and vulnerabilities of individuals with ASD in the context of cybersecurity.
