ABSTRACT
Social engineering is a well-established and well-studied threat
especially against healthy computer users. Little studied, however,
is the level of vulnerability to social engineering attacks against
people with medical conditions. Social disorders in particular may
make people more susceptible to such attacks. In this paper, as an
initial line of investigation into this understudied research line, we
launch a study of phishing, a prominent social engineering attack,
against people suffering from autism spectrum disorder, a unique
developmental disorder characterized by hampered social skills and
communication.
We present a study of phishing detection with two groups of
participants each with 15 participants, one diagnosed with autism
and other without autism, in which they were asked to distinguish
real versions of certain websites from their fake counterparts. Given
the known gullibility and social vulnerability of users with autism,
our study is designed to test the hypothesis that individuals with
autism will be more prone to such attacks in contrast to healthy
participants of prior studies. Our results, however, do not support
this hypothesis demonstrating that participants with autism are not
more vulnerable to phishing attempts. We attribute this result to
the unique characteristics of users with autism including attention
to detail, strong memory of factual information and diverse way of
thinking, which are skills that folklore assumes may actually make
users with autism highly qualified for cybersecurity careers. Over-
all, our work serves to demonstrate that targeted (spear) phishing
attacks against Internet users suffering from autism may not be
more successful compared to untargeted attacks against the user
population without autism. It also highlights that social disorders
may not necessarily facilitate social engineering attacks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker
directs users to fake websites having the look and feel similar to
that of a real website, with the intention of obtaining their sensitive
and private credentials. The attackers then exploit the information
gathered from such an attack to misuse the victim’s account.
Social engineering attacks are a well-established and well-studied
threat in the literature especially against normal computer users.
Researchers have conducted a number of human-centered phishing
detection studies with such users (e.g., [13–15, 29, 32, 34]), to un-
derstand their task performance in identifying phishing scams and
the effectiveness of anti-phishing toolbars, security indicators and
phishing warnings in preventing them. However, little work has
been conducted to investigate the level of vulnerability to social en-
gineering attacks against people with different medical conditions.
The Internet is used by a wide variety of people, and it is there-
fore important to understand how these people perform against
such security attacks. For example, a recent study by Oliveria et
al. involving aged and young people revealed that older men and
women might be more susceptible to spear-phishing attacks [27].
Such studies will help us understand these specific populations and
develop specialized security parameters, controls and warnings.
In particular, social disorders may make people more susceptible
to social engineering attacks. In this paper, as an initial line of inves-
tigation into this understudied research line, we launch a study of
phishing, a prominent social engineering attack, against individuals
with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a unique developmental dis-
order characterized by hampered social skills and communication.
ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in
social communication and social interaction, the presence of repet-
itive behaviors and restricted interests, and a complex combination
of diminished and intact cognitive abilities [9]). ASD is one of the
fastest-growing developmental disabilities in the United States with
a prevalence that has increased drastically, from 1 in 88 children in
2008, to 1 in 68 children in 2014 [5]. The increasing prevalence rates
of ASD mean that more and more people diagnosed with ASD in
their early childhood are now transitioning into adulthood where

they will soon be faced with the challenges of living independently.
One of these challenges includes the ability to make decisions and
discern the intentions of other people. As social interactions (i.e.,
conversational rules), non-verbal (i.e., body language) and non-
literal (i.e., sarcasm, deception) are known areas of impairment for
individuals with ASD, they are often taken advantage of [16, 35].
In this context, we conjecture that the users with autism might
be more vulnerable to the social engineering attacks, especially
phishing.
Our Contributions: In this paper, we contribute to the scientific
literature the first study of autism and phishing. Specifically, we
conduct a phishing detection study with 15 users with autism and 15
users without autismand report on their task accomplishment when
asked to identify the real and fake versions of websites. In line with
the prior studies of phishing detection [13, 25], we designed and
conducted our phishing detection study to understand the perfor-
mance of users with autism. We carefully enrolled the participants
with similar demographics to our study. First, we perform a quanti-
tative analysis on the task performance of the participants with and
without autism in the phishing detection task. In contrast to our
intuition, our results suggest that the users with autism performed
no less than the users without autism. Our results therefore do not
support our hypothesis based on the fact that the users with autism
are susceptible to deception. Second, we perform the qualitative
analysis of the responses of participants with and without autism
regarding security scams and phishing detection. The results we
obtained from our phishing detection task are explained by the
answers the participants with autism reported to our post-test ques-
tionnaire. We found out that the participants with autism noticed
the missing security locks/certificates, logos, and obfuscated URL
in the fake websites presented to them.
We attribute the above result to the several unique traits of users
with autism including paying attention to detail, being methodi-
cal, having strong memory of factual information and a diverse
way of thinking. Folklore assumes that these are needed skills in
the cybersecurity workforce for which users with autism are in
high demand [8]. Broadly, our work suggests that targeted spear
phishing attacks against Internet users with autism may not be
more successful compared to generalized attacks against typical
user population.
2 BACKGROUND & PRIOR WORK
In this section, we provide the background necessary to understand
our work and review relevant prior work.
2.1 Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD or simply autism) is a neurodevel-
opmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication
and social interaction, the presence of repetitive behaviors and re-
stricted interests, and a complex combination of diminished and
intact cognitive abilities [9]). ASD is one of the fastest-growing
developmental disabilities in the United States with a prevalence
that has increased drastically from 1 in 88 children in 2008, to 1 in
68 children in 2014 [5]. Though we were unable to find the exact
population statistics of the adults with autism, we argue that the
population will be huge in future as these children with ASD grow
up. And as the children with ASD become more independent in
adolescence and adulthood, more subtle and potentially dangerous
forms of deception become commonplace.
2.2 Related Work
Researchers have conducted a number of human-centered phishing
detection studies (e.g., [13–15, 25, 26, 29, 32, 34]), which focus on
users’ task performance in identifying phishing scams and the effec-
tiveness of anti-phishing toolbars, security indicators and phishing
warnings. Dhamija et al. recruited 22 participants and asked them
to identify real and fake websites and performed the quantitative
and qualitative analysis to understand people fall for phishing at-
tacks [13]. Egelman et al. examined the effectiveness of the phishing
warnings and analyzed why they fail users [14]. Friedman et al.
performed user study across regions to understand their concep-
tions of web security [15]. Schechter et al. performed a study to
evaluate the website authentication and the effect of role playing
on usability studies with mostly university students [29]. Sunshine
et al. performed a study on the effectiveness of SSL warnings [32].
Wu et al. performed a study to understand the effectiveness of se-
curity toolbars in preventing phishing attacks [34]. Neupane et al.
[25, 26] reported on the neural activities of the users when they are
performing phishing detection and warnings tasks. However, while
our study specifically focuses on the users with autism, all of these
studies were conducted with general population. They have usually
revealed that such users do not pay attention to the browser-based
phishing cues and often make incorrect choices.
Recently, researchers have been performing user studies on spe-
cific sets of populations [19–24, 27]. Oliveria et al. conducted a
phishing study on aged and young people revealed that older men
and women might be more susceptible to spear-phishing attacks
[27]. Such studies will help us understand these specific population
and develop specialized security parameters, and warnings. Lerner
et al. conduct a study of encrypted email client with the lawyers
and journalists and report that they may have diverse operational
constraints and threat models, and the one-size-fits-all solution
may not be useful to them [19]. Mcgregor et al. report on the usable
security study on the successful collaboration of journalists in keep-
ing the investigation of Panama paper secret before their release
[24]. Mcgregor et al. also conducted user studies with journalists
and reported on the practical and cultural constraints that can limit
the computer security and privacy practices of the journalism com-
munity [23] and how existing security tools may not be effective
for journalists [22]. These studies suggest that the current security
tools may not be suitable for all segments of the population and
demands more investigation to understand on needs of special tar-
get populations. Marne et al. [21] studied the usability of learning
system-assigned passwords on the people with learning disabilities.
Mare et al. [20] analyzed the security and privacy challenges in
designing services for low-literate users in developing regions.
Although relatively little research has been conducted to examine
the topic of gullibility and deception in the autism population,
findings have been consistent in demonstrating that individuals
with ASD are more trusting [36] and more easily deceived than
their typically developing counterparts [12, 35]. This susceptibility

to lies and deception can be harmful to users with autism in the
context of school-age relationships and bullying [31]. Unlike these
studies, our study shows that the users with autism might not be
as susceptible to phishing attacks as one may have expected. Their
ability to notice small changes, and the detailed oriented nature
might be helpful in identifying such attacks [2, 4].
Several of the impairments seen in individuals with ASD may
contribute to this susceptibility to deception including impairments
in executive function (e.g., theory of mind), social interactions (e.g.,
conversational rules, facial expressions), and non-literal (e.g., sar-
casm) [10, 12, 16, 18, 35]. Deficits in theory of mind (ToM) have been
well-studied in the ASD population and refers to an individual’s
ability to infer the mental states of others [10, 16]. This ability has
also been studied in relation to a larger group of cognitive abilities
known as executive functions, a group of cognitive abilities used
to accomplish goals (e.g., planning, inhibition, cognitive flexibility,
working memory) [33]. Impairments in these areas often result
in isolation and inability to form and maintain peer relationships
among children and adolescents with ASD [17]. Kloosterman et
al. investigated the association between these executive function-
ing impairments and peer victimization among adolescents with
ASD, and found that poorer executive functioning predicted higher
amounts of physical, social and verbal peer victimization [18]. Al-
though executive functioning impacts the ability to determine the
mental states and motivations of others, social interactions and
reading the non-verbal cues of others may also determine an indi-
vidual’s ability to detect deception [31].
Dennis et al. the examined how the social interaction of chil-
dren with high-functioning ASD impacted the detection of real
and deceptive emotion [12]. Findings suggest that children with
ASD were less able than normal children to correctly identify the
emotions people feel, deceptive emotional expression in the face,
and the motivation behind the deception [12]. This inability to
detect deception and motivations behind it is often manifested in
the form of victimization and bullying in adolescents with ASD
[17, 31]. School-age children and adolescents with ASD report sig-
nificantly higher rates of victimization and bullying compared to
their typically developing counterparts [17].
In this study, we focus on understanding how users with autism
react to the phishing websites presented to them. Internet deception
and fraudulent websites, more commonly referred to as phishing
scams, are prime examples of this and have become extremely prob-
lematic as internet access and use are so prevalent. Due to the
vulnerability of individuals with ASD to deception in the context of
peer relationships, these individuals may also be more vulnerable to
an increasingly more common deceptive scheme – Internet decep-
tion. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is among the
first to examine the susceptibility of individuals with ASD to fraudu-
lent websites and phishing scams compared to typically developing
individuals.
3 STUDY DESIGN
Phishing attack involves stealing a user’s private credentials by
presenting a fake website as a trustworthy entity. The attackers
exploit the users’ trust in the appearance of a website by designing
a visually similar fake website. The victims are lead to these fake

websites through the emails impersonated to come from the real
websites/companies. These websites may have logo and website
address (URL) similar to the real website. So the users should check
for the domain name and look at the indicators of a valid secure
connection and the details of the certificate to distinguish between
real and fake websites. However, the users, even though they may
know what to look for, may not always notice these parameters. To
test these skills and to test the strength of the users with autism
in identifying real and impersonated websites, we designed our
phishing detection task.
Fully in line with the design of prior phishing detection stud-
ies [13, 26], we assumed that the users have already reached the
fake website and need to identify its validity. To this end, we ex-
plicitly asked the participants to detect the fake websites from real
websites, and focused on determining their performance, and on
understanding their real-vs-fake decision-making.
We selected websites from the top 100 rank of Alexa [1]. e.g.,
Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Facebook, and Citibank. We then created
