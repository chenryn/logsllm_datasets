### 6. Protocol Schema

In this section, we will provide a detailed description of the SAML Single Sign-on Browser/Artifact profile protocol schema. We have already introduced the protocol flow in Section 2 and depicted it in Figure 1.

#### 6.1. Step 1: Contact the Source Site

**Description:**
- **(a) B →bs cid S:** The browser B initiates contact with the source site S by sending a GET request to the inter-site transfer URL of S.
- **(b) S:** The source site S parses the request and initiates a new session for it. S attempts to extract the target description `target` from the request's query string.

**Message Format:**
- The message sent to S is an HTTP GET request containing the target resource `target` that user U wants to access on destination site D.
- The SAML Single Sign-on Profile does not specify additional elements for this URL, nor does it prohibit the inclusion of further elements.
- The lack of explicit naming of protocol type or step can lead to difficulties in dispatching messages to different protocol modules and allows malicious destination sites to accumulate artifacts within this URL, potentially repeating steps 1 to 3.

**Lack of Authentication:**
- This connection does not provide unilateral authentication, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- An adversary can intercept the communication between B and S, and the two honest parties cannot distinguish the adversary from the intended communication partner.
- User tracking is also problematic as the SAML Single Sign-on Profile does not specify strong user tracking, leaving it open to MITM attacks.

#### 6.2. Step 2: Initiating the Redirect to the Destination Site

**Description:**
- After recognizing user U, the source site S generates one or more SAML artifacts and includes them in a SAML searchpart.
- S then redirects browser B to the artifact receiver URL `D` of the destination site D, with the SAML searchpart as the query string.

**Substeps:**
- **(a) S:** Determines the destination site D corresponding to the target of Step 1 and looks up D in its artifact receiver table.
- **(b) S:** Generates one or more SAML artifacts.
- **(c) S:** Generates a SAML searchpart `SAMLsp` that contains the target description and the generated artifacts.
- **(d) S →bs cid B:** Sends a 302 redirect response to B, including the `SAMLsp` in the query string.

**Lack of Authentication:**
- Similar to Step 1, this step does not provide unilateral authentication, making it susceptible to MITM attacks between B and S.

#### 6.3. Step 3: Redirect to the Destination Site

**Description:**
- Browser B connects to the destination site D and delivers the SAML artifacts.

**Substeps:**
- **(a) B:** Extracts the URL `D?SAMLsp` from the Location header of the 302 redirect response.
- **(b) B →bd cid D:** Sends a GET request to D, including the `SAMLsp`.

**Lack of Authentication:**
- This step again lacks unilateral authentication, making it vulnerable to replay attacks and MITM attacks between B and D.
- The SAML Single Sign-on protocol assumes that D is connected to browser B of user U, which is critical for security.

#### 6.4. Step 4: SAML Request

**Description:**
- The destination site D establishes a secure channel to the source site S and sends a SAML request containing the received artifacts.

**Substeps:**
- **(a) D:** Checks the validity of the artifacts and ensures they contain the same non-empty `SourceID`.
- **(b) D:** Looks up the SAML responder URL of the source site S using the `SourceID`.
- **(c) D:** Generates a `RequestID`.
- **(d) D(idD) ⇒ds cid S(idS):** Sends a SAML request to S, including the artifacts and the `RequestID`.

**Lack of Authentication:**
- The protocol does not fully specify the information D knows about S, leading to potential security issues.

#### 6.5. Step 5: SAML Response

**Description:**
- The source site S analyzes the SAML request and generates a response, which it sends back through the secure channel established in Step 4.

**Substeps:**
- **(a) S:** Checks for artifact destination equality.
- **(b) S:** Enforces the one-time use of the artifacts.
- **(c) S:** Looks up or generates SAML assertions corresponding to the artifacts.
- **(d) S:** Generates a `ResponseID`.
- **(e) S(idS) ⇒ds cid D(idD):** Sends a SAML response containing SSO assertions or an error code, referencing the `RequestID` in the `InResponseTo` element.
- **(f) D:** Verifies the validity of the SAML response.

**One-request Property of the SAML Artifact:**
- SAML artifacts can be used only once. If an artifact is presented again, S must return the same message as if the artifact were unknown.

**Multiple Services on One Host:**
- A source site S can only verify that it issued the artifact to the same hostname. If there are multiple services on the destination site D, a malicious low-security service could use received artifacts to impersonate the user to a high-security service.

#### 6.6. Step 6: Response to the Browser

**Description:**
- The destination site D responds to browser B’s request. If D is convinced of user U’s identity, it will present the requested target resource; otherwise, it will typically reply with an error message.

**Substep:**
- **(a) D →bd cid B:** Responds with the requested resource page or an error message.

**Lack of Specification:**
- The SAML Single Sign-on protocol does not precisely specify this step, leaving the connection and security properties unspecified.

### 7. Attacks

We present three attacks on the SAML Single Sign-on Browser/Artifact profile based on the flaws identified above.

#### 7.1. Connection Hijacking / Replay Attack

**Prerequisites:**
- An adversary A can intercept and observe the connection from browser B to the artifact receiver URL D in Step 3.
- The integrity property claimed in Step 3 is interpreted as message integrity without binding to the sending party and replay prevention.

**The Attack:**
- **Step 3:** B → D: Redirect p to D
- **A:** Adversary A intercepts this redirect and finishes the connection from B to D.
- **Step 3*:** AB → D: Replay of redirect p to D
- **Step 4:** D → S: SAML request q with SAML artifacts of p.
- **Step 5:** S → D: SAML response r with assertions.
- **Step 6*:** D → AB: Response to Step 3*

**Discussion:**
- The integrity and confidentiality properties of Step 3 are not strong enough to prevent a replay attack. Adversary A can resend the encrypted message, impersonating B to D, and D cannot distinguish between B and A due to the lack of authentication.
