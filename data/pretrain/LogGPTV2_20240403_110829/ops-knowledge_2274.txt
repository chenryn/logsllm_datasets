User: I just followed the instructions on the site and installed aerospike (on linux mint).  I'm able to import the aerospike python client module from python 2.7 but not from 3.6 (newly installed).  I'm thinking that I need to add the directory to my "python path" perhaps??, but having difficulty understanding how this works.  I want to be able to run aerospike and matplotlib in 3.6.
Assistant: I figured it out.  I just needed to use pip3 instead of pip to install it to correct version of python (though I was only able to get it onto 3.5, not 3.6 for some reason).
