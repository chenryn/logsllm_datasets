User: How do I direct Eclipse to the Python interpreter on my Mac?
I've looked in Library which contains the directory 'Python' then '2.3' and '2.5', however they contain nothing except 'Site-packages' - Which is weird considering I can go into the terminal and type python. I then installed the latest 2.6 version with package manager and still can't find it. Can anyone help?
Assistant: Running $which python should help locate your Python installation.
