Who Am I?
‣ More than 15 years professional experience 
as a software & systems engineer 
‣ Most of my career has been spent working 
on wireless communications & emitter 
geolocation systems 
‣ Last year’s winner of the Hide & Seek and 
Foxhunt events in the Wireless Pentathlon

What is Foxhunting?
‣ Finding the physical location of wireless emitters and/or their users, by 
measuring received power from different locations 
‣ Foxhunting is between the "last mile" and the “last feet”; for greater or lesser 
distances, other techniques are more appropriate 
‣ Wet-work ninjas ﬁnding the correct bedroom in the house of the South 
American populist government ofﬁcial 
‣ Tracking the Corporate Exec whose iPhone you've trojaned into an 
access point, as part of a Red Team penetration test 
‣ DEFCON 22 Wireless CTF 
‣ Techniques are applicable to all RF emitters, like mobiles phones, WiFi APs, 
heart monitors, etc.

What Equipment’s Involved?
‣ Antennas 
‣ Omnidirectional and directional, for different purposes 
‣ Radios 
‣ Capable of receiving the signal-of-interest 
‣ Software-deﬁned radios are ﬁnally becoming affordable 
‣ Visualization Software 
‣ Most important feature is viewing received power over time

Aperture Versus Gain
‣ As a rule, the more sensitive the antenna, the more 
focused (directional) its reception pattern 
‣ Too much gain can be a bad thing 
‣ High gain requires accurate pointing 
‣ Power curve follows the Inverse-Square Law 
‣ Unless you can attenuate your gain, you lose range 
discrimination when you’re close to an emitter
7
Omnidirectional 
Antennas
‣ Typically have a toroidal radiation 
pattern 
‣ Gain varies inversely with z-axis 
directionality  
‣ For foxhunting, high gain is good 
‣ Provides greater detection 
distance 
‣ Allows some degree of 
attenuation by varying orientation
8
Directional Antennas
‣ There are only two good choices, based on availability: 
‣
Yagi: High gain, narrow aperture, narrow bandwidth 
‣
Panel: Refers to several varieties of antennas that are ﬂat 
perpendicular to their boresight, therefore performance varies 
‣ Log-periodic antennas are also available, but are less common 
‣ If you’re on a budget, it’s easy to make your own Cantenna or 
WokFi 
‣ Choose your antenna based on performance and form factor

Directional Antenna Pattern
Beware of back lobes & side lobes when hunting
10
Multi-antenna Arrays
‣ Generally proprietary (Read: expensive) 
‣ Require custom software 
‣ Tricky to conﬁgure and use correctly 
‣ But awesome when you have one! 
‣ Challenge: Create a HackRF-based DF array
11
Gear Selection:
Radios
12
Cost Versus Performance
‣ RF equipment can get expensive quickly 
‣ Broadband radios and software-deﬁned radios 
are more expensive than their application-
speciﬁc counterparts, but are more ﬂexible 
‣ Low-cost SDR is starting to become a reality 
‣ WiFi radios are particularly inexpensive; perfect 
for beginners: Alfa 1, Alfa N & TL-WN722N
13
Variable Attenuators
‣ Used to reduce the strength of the received signal 
‣ Allow you to use a very high-gain antenna, even at 
close ranges 
‣ Not strictly necessary, but add versatility 
‣ Many types are available, but they usually aren’t 
cheap; check eBay 
‣ Old-fashioned variable attenuator: rotate your antenna
14
Signal Displays
15
Power Spectral Display
‣ Helps locate your target in the RF spectrum 
‣ Not always needed, if you have other ways of tuning
16
Power/Time Domain
‣ Used to track your target over time 
‣ Foxhunting tool of choice
17
Spectrogram
‣ AKA Cumulative Spectral 
Decay / Waterfall 
‣ PSD & PTD combined 
‣ Can be used to track 
multiple emitters over time 
‣ Information overload for 
simple foxhunting
18
Using Your Gear
19
Preparation
‣ Know and be comfortable with your equipment, 
especially how long your batteries will last 
‣ Learn detection ranges for your particular setup; 
WiFi radios estimate signal strength inconsistently  
‣ Know how sensitive your back/side lobes are 
‣ Become ﬂuent in the software you’re using 
‣ Practice
20
Inconspicuousness
‣ If you have a bunch of obvious equipment, people will be wary 
and avoid you 
‣ Fly below the radar, or risk spooking your target
21
General Tips
‣ Be aggressive! Make an active effort to seek your target  
‣ Be aware of your environment, and take an organized 
approach to your search area; don’t just wander randomly 
‣ Keep a mental map of where you’ve been, and the 
observed signal levels along the way, for mental 
triangulation 
‣ Heads Up! Don't glue your nose to the screen, or you 
might miss a chance to ﬁnd your target based on 
secondary indicators
22
Multipath
‣ RF emanations will reﬂect off structures and objects 
‣ Same signal will be received from different directions at 
different times (Phase Shift) 
‣ Changes the SNR of the received signal (Multipath Fading) 
‣ To mitigate multipath interference during a foxhunt, keep 
moving!
23
Using An Omni
‣ Used for proximity detection (Am I getting closer to the 
emitter?) 
‣ Possible to successfully hunt with just an omni 
‣ Easier when dealing with stationary targets 
‣ Move around a lot to determine emitter proximity from 
various locations 
‣ Keep a good mental map, to perform on-the-ﬂy 
triangulation
24
Using A Directional
‣ Steers you in the right direction, once you’ve determined 
proximity using the omni 
‣ Helpful to have a variable attenuator between your 
directional antenna and the radio 
‣ Reduces the antenna’s lobes (enhancing 
directionality) 
‣ Reduces your effective gain when you're getting 
closer, to give you more headroom against your 
radio's maximum input gain
25
Basic Strategy
‣ Tune your radios to the target emitter 
‣ Walk a search pattern, watching the signal strength on a PTD plot 
‣ Use the omni to determine if you’re getting closer 
‣ Use the directional, and your historical direction of travel, to 
determine in which direction to continue 
‣ If you start to peak your signal, add attenuation 
‣ Don’t go too fast, because received power will ﬂuctuate 
‣ Look around: The emitter may become obvious once you relate RF 
power to what you see in the environment
26
My WiFi Setup
‣ 5db Omnidirectional rubber duck 
‣ 8db simpleWiFi mini panel 
‣ HP 8495A Manual Step Attenuator 
‣ Alfa USB NICs - Alfa 1 & Alfa N 
‣ Alfa N on the omni - it holds connections better 
‣ Alfa 1 on the panel - it’s more of a pure radio 
‣ No good free software; Kismet/Kismon, WiFi Analyzer (Android), 
NetSurveyor (Windows), and Wireless Diagnostics (OS X) are OK
