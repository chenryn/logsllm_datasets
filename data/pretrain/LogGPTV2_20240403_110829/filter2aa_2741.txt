## Who Am I?
- Over 15 years of professional experience as a software and systems engineer.
- Specialized in wireless communications and emitter geolocation systems.
- Winner of the Hide & Seek and Foxhunt events at the Wireless Pentathlon last year.

## What is Foxhunting?
Foxhunting involves locating the physical position of wireless emitters or their users by measuring received power from different locations. It is typically used for distances between the "last mile" and the "last feet." Other techniques are more suitable for greater or lesser distances. Examples include:
- Locating specific individuals within a building, such as a South American government official.
- Tracking a corporate executive whose iPhone has been turned into an access point during a Red Team penetration test.
- Competing in events like DEFCON 22 Wireless CTF.
- Techniques are applicable to all RF emitters, including mobile phones, WiFi access points, and heart monitors.

## Equipment Involved
- **Antennas**: Omnidirectional and directional, each serving different purposes.
- **Radios**: Capable of receiving the signal of interest. Software-defined radios (SDRs) are becoming more affordable.
- **Visualization Software**: Essential for viewing received power over time.

### Gear Selection: Antennas

#### Aperture Versus Gain
- Generally, the more sensitive an antenna, the more focused (directional) its reception pattern.
- High gain requires accurate pointing and can be detrimental if not managed properly.
- The power curve follows the Inverse-Square Law.
- Without proper attenuation, high gain can reduce range discrimination when close to an emitter.

#### Omnidirectional Antennas
- Typically have a toroidal radiation pattern.
- Gain varies inversely with z-axis directionality.
- High gain is beneficial for foxhunting as it provides greater detection distance.
- Allows some degree of attenuation by varying orientation.

#### Directional Antennas
- **Yagi**: High gain, narrow aperture, and narrow bandwidth.
- **Panel**: Refers to flat, perpendicular antennas with varying performance.
- **Log-periodic Antennas**: Less common but available.
- Budget-friendly options include DIY Cantenna or WokFi.
- Choose based on performance and form factor.

#### Directional Antenna Pattern
- Be cautious of back lobes and side lobes when hunting.

#### Multi-antenna Arrays
- Generally proprietary and expensive.
- Require custom software and are challenging to configure.
- Extremely effective when used correctly.
- Challenge: Create a HackRF-based DF array.

### Gear Selection: Radios

#### Cost Versus Performance
- RF equipment can be expensive.
- Broadband and SDRs are more flexible but cost more than application-specific counterparts.
- Low-cost SDRs are becoming more accessible.
- WiFi radios, such as Alfa 1, Alfa N, and TL-WN722N, are inexpensive and ideal for beginners.

#### Variable Attenuators
- Used to reduce the strength of the received signal.
- Allow the use of high-gain antennas even at close ranges.
- Not strictly necessary but add versatility.
- Available on eBay; rotating the antenna can also serve as a variable attenuator.

### Signal Displays

#### Power Spectral Display
- Helps locate the target in the RF spectrum.
- Not always necessary if other tuning methods are available.

#### Power/Time Domain
- Tracks the target over time.
- Preferred tool for foxhunting.

#### Spectrogram
- Also known as Cumulative Spectral Decay or Waterfall.
- Combines Power Spectral Display and Power/Time Domain.
- Useful for tracking multiple emitters over time.
- Can be overwhelming for simple foxhunting.

## Using Your Gear

### Preparation
- Familiarize yourself with your equipment, especially battery life.
- Understand the detection ranges of your setup; WiFi radios may estimate signal strength inconsistently.
- Know the sensitivity of your back and side lobes.
- Become proficient in the software you use.
- Practice regularly.

### Inconspicuousness
- Avoid drawing attention with obvious equipment.
- Stay under the radar to prevent spooking your target.

### General Tips
- Be proactive in seeking your target.
- Organize your search area and avoid random wandering.
- Maintain a mental map of your path and observed signal levels for triangulation.
- Stay alert to secondary indicators; don’t focus solely on the screen.

### Multipath
- RF signals reflect off structures and objects.
- This results in multipath fading, changing the SNR of the received signal.
- To mitigate interference, keep moving.

### Using an Omnidirectional Antenna
- Useful for proximity detection.
- Can be used alone for stationary targets.
- Move around to determine emitter proximity from various locations.
- Maintain a mental map for on-the-fly triangulation.

### Using a Directional Antenna
- Guides you in the right direction once proximity is determined.
- A variable attenuator between the antenna and radio is helpful.
- Reduces antenna lobes and effective gain, providing more headroom against the radio's maximum input gain.

### Basic Strategy
1. Tune your radios to the target emitter.
2. Walk a search pattern, monitoring signal strength on a PTD plot.
3. Use the omni to determine if you’re getting closer.
4. Use the directional antenna and historical direction of travel to guide your path.
5. Add attenuation if the signal peaks.
6. Move slowly to account for signal fluctuations.
7. Observe the environment; the emitter may become visually apparent.

### My WiFi Setup
- **Omnidirectional Antenna**: 5dB rubber duck.
- **Directional Antenna**: 8dB simpleWiFi mini panel.
- **Attenuator**: HP 8495A Manual Step Attenuator.
- **Radios**: Alfa USB NICs - Alfa 1 and Alfa N.
- **Configuration**:
  - Alfa N on the omni (better connection stability).
  - Alfa 1 on the panel (more of a pure radio).
- **Software**: Kismet/Kismon, WiFi Analyzer (Android), NetSurveyor (Windows), and Wireless Diagnostics (OS X) are adequate, though no free software is ideal.
