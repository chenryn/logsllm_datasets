### Characterization of Propagation Pathloss and Coverage Holes in MadMesh Network

#### Propagation Pathloss Analysis
We follow the measurement methodology reported in prior research on propagation modeling [9] and collect signal strength information at 25 different locations for each MAP. We compute the pathloss exponent for different MAPs in the MadMesh network. Our results indicate significant variations in pathloss exponents between different MAPs.

**Figure 11: Propagation Pathloss for Two Different MAPs in Diverse Settings**
- **(a) Campus MAP**: Located in a campus setting, with a pathloss exponent of 2.3.
- **(b) Downtown MAP**: Located in a downtown setting, with a pathloss exponent of 2.9.

As shown in Figure 11, the pathloss exponent for the downtown MAP is 2.9, while the pathloss exponent for the campus MAP is 2.3. This contrasts with the pathloss of 3.3 reported in [9], where the pathloss exponent was found to be stable across different access points in their network. The significant variation in pathloss exponents can be attributed to diverse sets of obstacles and external interference, which vary significantly from one location to another within the city. This suggests that generalizing a single pathloss exponent for a city-wide mesh deployment may be inaccurate, and targeted experiments must be performed to determine the pathloss in different parts of the city. This observation further reinforces the ineffectiveness of pathloss models in identifying coverage holes.

#### Characterizing Coverage Holes
To assess the prevalence of coverage holes in the mesh deployment, we perform extensive client measurements. In our experiments, several clients (IBM laptops with Cisco Aironet wireless cards) were equipped with a module that continuously records location, current state of association, and received signal strength. Periodically, this information is uploaded to a central server. Over a period of seven days, the aggregated data is used to detect coverage holes in the network.

**Figure 12: Average Client Connectivity in the Target Area**
- **Coverage Holes**: Although the propagation model-based radio map generated by the mesh controller shows the entire area as covered, additional coverage holes were observed by the clients.

**Vehicular Client Connectivity**
- **Vehicle Speed**: 25 miles/hr
- **Coverage Holes at Vehicular Speeds**: As shown in Figure 12, the coverage holes detected at vehicular speeds are much larger than those detected during walking experiments. Approximately 65% of the total path falls under the category of coverage holes at vehicular speeds. These observations highlight the importance of actual client-side measurements in accurately detecting coverage holes.

#### Client Performance Assessment
To evaluate the performance of end users in the mesh deployment, we undertake targeted active measurements. We randomly sample 100 locations in the mesh coverage area and perform bandwidth tests to determine the achievable throughput at each location. At each sampled location, we associate with the MAP with the strongest signal strength and run TCP iperf [14] from the client to the mesh controller.

**Figure 15: CDF of Throughput Measured at 100 Random Locations**
- **Throughput Distribution**: The measured throughput closely matches a uniform distribution, with about 10% of the clients achieving less than 0.2 Mbps and 80% of the clients achieving throughput less than 1 Mbps. This upper limit on client throughput aligns with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of MadMesh, which advertises a 1 Mbps service to the clients.

**Impact of Hop Count, Channel Congestion, and RSSI on Client Performance**
- **Hop Count**: There is no strong correlation between throughput and hop count. Variations in throughput at different MAPs with the same hop count can be attributed to channel congestion on their access sides.
- **Channel Congestion**: The presence of traffic from other 802.11b/g sources can significantly impact the throughput observed at each hop. Channel congestion does not affect clients connected to the first hop due to fewer links to contend with.
- **Shared Congestion**: In the presence of multiple clients, shared channel congestion can lead to significant throughput degradation, especially for clients connected to higher-hop MAPs.

**Summary**
- **Bandwidth Shaping**: In the Madcity mesh network, hop count is not a bottleneck for performance due to bandwidth shaping policies. However, in the presence of shared congestion, lower-hop paths are still preferable to avoid throughput degradation.

#### Mesh Usage Characterization
To understand how the mesh network is being used, we analyze the following aspects:

**Client Distribution Across Time**
- **Figure 16: Average Number of Clients per Hour Connected to the Network**
  - **Usage Pattern**: The average number of clients varies considerably throughout the day, with the highest number of clients connected around 10 PM and the lowest at 5 AM. During the busiest hour, approximately 627 clients were connected, with an average of 498 clients connected.

**Client Distribution Across MAPs**
- **Average Number of Clients per MAP**: This metric provides insights into the distribution of clients across the coverage area and helps identify popular MAPs.

By analyzing these metrics, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the usage patterns and performance characteristics of the MadMesh network, enabling more effective management and optimization.
