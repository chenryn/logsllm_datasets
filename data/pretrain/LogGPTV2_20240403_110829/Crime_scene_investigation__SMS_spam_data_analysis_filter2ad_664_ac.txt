indicates that at least 16% of the SMS traﬃc originated by
all the A1 modems in the network is spam. This shows
a clear preference of spammers for this particular cellular
modem.
3.5 The Alibi: Voice and IP trafﬁc
As observed in the previous sections, SMS spammers at-
tempt to reach as many targets as possible by ﬂooding large
amounts of messages. This paper focuses on SMS spam anal-
ysis. Nevertheless, we include voice and IP traﬃc data in our
study and the results are rather interesting. Spammers do

than legitimate users, however the average number of phone
call destinations is much lower (Figures 11a and 11b). This
number of phone calls could perhaps indicate that they are
trying to mimic legitimate users. In terms of voice traﬃc
duration, phone calls placed by spammers are much shorter
than those of legitimate users, as it can be observed on Fig-
ure 11c. This is because, despite they seem to attempt to
match the calling proﬁle of a legitimate user, these calls can-
not be sustained for a long time since the recipient will hang
up. The short call duration could also indicate that these
calls might be spam as well. Most of the times, the recipient
of a spam call will hang up immediately.
Unlike in SMS traﬃc, spammers do not ﬂood with calls a
large number of recipients. They might be communicating
with a small set of numbers that they know will pick up the
call even though they might hang up quickly.
The results are further detailed in Figure 12. Figure 12a
plots the average number of call destinations per day (y-
axis) versus the average number of calls (x-axis), in log-log
scale. One can see that spammers cluster around a large
number of calls to a small set of destinations. In parallel,
both cell-phone users and M2M devices make phone calls to
a proportional set of destinations.

their recipients for spammers (red), legitimate cus-
tomers (green) and M2M (blue)
The diﬀerence in behavior of spammers is highly accentu-
ated in Figure 12b, which plots the average number of SMS
destinations (x-axis) against the number of voice call des-
tinations (y-axis). Spammers appear to be placing phone
calls to a set of recipients that is much smaller than the set
of targets for the text message abuse. This ﬁgure also hints
that legitimate users, on average, tend to communicate to a
larger set of contacts by phone than by text message. This
could be explained based on the fact that cell-phone users
rely on the extremely popular SMS service to communicate
with friends and relatives. However, phone calls are made
to this same set of users plus other contacts such as restau-
rants to make a reservation, the doctor’s oﬃce to make an
appointment, etc. Therefore, the set of call recipients will
be larger than for SMSs.
IP trafﬁc
3.5.2
Finally, we examine IP traﬃc. Figure 13 plots the dis-
tribution of the up-link and down-link byte counts related
to the three account categories under analysis. Spammers
generate a small amount of data, consisting on several small
transactions.
Cell-phone users and M2M systems generate asymmetric
IP data traﬃc. Regular users often consume more band-
width in the downlink, by browsing videos, media and other
kinds of content. Their uplink traﬃc is generally lower.
M2M appliances have the opposite behavior. Used mostly
as reporting tools for applications such as remote alarm and
ﬂeet control, they often generate a larger load in the uplink.
4. STOPPING THE CRIME
The results presented in this paper have been used to de-
velop an accurate SMS spam detection engine. The descrip-
tion, details and results obtained are out of the scope of
this paper, but will be submitted in the near future. In this
section, though, we oﬀer a brief overall glimpse.
An advanced SMS spam detection algorithm is proposed
based on an ensemble of decision trees. Over 40 speciﬁc fea-
tures are extracted from messaging patterns and processed
through a combination of decision trees. Moreover, in order
to speed up the spam detection process, the system focuses
on features that only require one to a few messages to ob-
tain. This algorithm also leverages the insights on M2M
SMS messaging patterns described in this paper.
5. RELATED WORK
SMS spam has not been widely discussed in literture. Nev-
ertheless, there is some work introducing diﬀerent detection
schemes. For example, the authors of [24] propose a detec-
tion engine based on analyzing the social network of connec-
tions of spammers. Other approaches are based on investi-
gating the content of SMS spam messages [12].
There is plenty of literature on spam messaging analysis
on other communication systems. The most widespread type
of spam is electronic mail (email) spam. In this context, [17]
presents interesting ﬁndings on how message abusers harvest
large lists of email addresses to use as targets for their spam
campaigns. The authors of [18] study the network-level be-
havior of spammers in the email world. Email messaging
abuse is found to originate from a very few regions of the
IP address space. This messages are generated from an im-
mense swarm of bots, each one of them sending only a few
450(a)

pieces of mail over very short periods of time. It is inter-
esting to note that this somehow correlates with the SMS
spam world where, based on our data analysis in Section 3,
messages are originated from a few geographic hot-spots and
by accounts with a very short tenure. Based on the ﬁndings
in [18], the authors of [26] proposed an algorithm to detect
and track bot-nets based on email spam records.
Email spam has been a known problem for many years
and there is already plenty of work proposing advanced de-
tection schemes. For example, the authors of [13] study the
eﬀectiveness of DNS blacklisting and [10] presents a survey
of known spam ﬁltering techniques with particular emphasis
on how well they work.
There is also some work analyzing other kinds of spam
and messaging abuse. For example, [14] studies the traf-
ﬁc characteristics of tweet spam and propaganda. Message
(tweet) abuse is generated by a small amount of playes that
generate large amounts of messages, most of which appear
to be retweets, in short periods of time. Other interesting
works analyze messaging abuse and spam in the context of
YouTube comments [20] and the blogosphere [21]. Finally,
the authors of [9] study the risk of sophisticated context-
aware spam that could result from information sharing on
social networks.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we study characteristics and traﬃc patterns
of SMS spam accounts based on real cellular network from
a tier-1 provider in the United States. The results are com-
pared against a sample of real traﬃc from legitimate cell-
phone users and M2M devices.
Conﬁrming the common presumption, we identify that
99.64% of the spammers connect using pre-paid accounts.
The simple availability of such SIM cards make them the
perfect tool for SMS abuse. Observations indicate an av-
erage age for the pre-paid accounts between 7 and 11 days.
We also ﬁnd indications of the preference spammers have for
a very small set of hardware devices. Spam traﬃc analysis
reveals that 84% of the spammers use one of the top 5 spam-
ming tools in the US. In particular, 65% of the spammers
choose to connect to the network with the top device.
We conﬁrm common intuitions about spammers, such as
the large number of text messages sent per day to a wide tar-
get list. Spammers generate two orders of magnitude more
messages than cell-phone users and one order of magnitude
greater than most M2M systems. These messages are sent
mostly to diﬀerent recipients, with a ratio of recipients to
messages sent very close to one. Further investigation of the
messaging ﬂow indicates that spammers also receive a large
number of messages. Nevertheless, the number of incoming
SMS is relatively very low with respect to the number of
transmitted spam texts.
The study of geo-location data identiﬁes the areas of
Sacramento, Los Angeles-Orange County and Miami Beach
as the major spamming hot-spots in the US. From these
locations, spammers launch very geographically distributed
campaigns targeting all area codes uniformly. Nevertheless,
some spammers are engaged in very geographically focused
spamming campaigns.
In terms of mobility, we conclude
that spammers are often mobile around their local area.
Finally, spammers are found to generate a large number
of very short phone calls and data transactions with a very
small number of end points. This could be perhaps a strat-
egy to mislead spam detection ﬁlters by replicating human-
like network traﬃc behavior.
Our traﬃc analysis indicates that certain networked appli-
ances have messaging behavior close to that of a spammer.
A small number of M2M systems transmit a large number
of SMSs per day. These are often devices that communicate
with a large number of destinations as well. Despite not be-
ing very abundant, we identify a substantial number of M2M
enabled objects with a ratio destination to number of mes-
sages very close to 1. These appliances communicate with
a large set of area codes as well. However, these area codes
have low entropy in the sense that the recipients of the mes-
sages are always the same. Based on the investigation in this
paper, we identify Machine to Machine communications as
an important player in SMS networks. Such systems should
be taken into consideration when designing SMS spam de-
tection and ﬁltering schemes. Systems designed otherwise
could incur the risk of blocking or erroneously labeling le-
gitimate text messages as message abuse.
The results presented in this paper are being used to de-
sign an advanced SMS spam detection system.
