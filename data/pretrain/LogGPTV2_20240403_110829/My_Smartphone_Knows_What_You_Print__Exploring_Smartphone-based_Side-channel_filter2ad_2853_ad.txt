It depicts that the reconstruction performance deterio-
rates rapidly when the distance from smartphone to print-
ers increases (as low as the 34.45% at the 40cm distance).
Nevertheless, with the dramatic advancement of the sen-
sors equipped on smartphones, the higher sensitivity will
lead to longer eﬀective attack range. Moreover, attacking
with multiple smartphones is another direction to explore.
Some work [35, 23, 44] have showed that multi-sensor fusion
system can achieve more information in higher dimension,
further enhance the signal-to-noise rate, and address certain
limitations (e.g., distance) in the single-sensor system.
Print Speed Eﬀect: Print speed is a critical factor to
aﬀect the fabrication quality. The best print speed is deter-
mined by the material thermoplastic property. In this study,
we employ the PLA plastic ﬁlament, whose recommended
print speed is 180 mm/min. Some emerging materials (e.g.
soft hydrogel material) can have a quality print with a very
fast velocity.
In the future plan, we will evaluate the at-
tack approaches on diﬀerent print speeds. We expect the
performance will reach a limit on some very fast print speed
setup, and this limitation is caused by smartphone hardware
speciﬁcation (e.g., sampling frequency, sensor sensitivity).
Position Eﬀect: The smartphone’s position has limited
eﬀect on the acoustic signal since the sound propagation is
spherical and fast enough. The absolute magnetic signal, on
the other hand, changes with regard to the magnetic ﬁeld
distribution around the 3D printer as well as the smart-
phone’s position. The directional pattern (Figure 9) might
be inverse when the smartphone is moved to the other side of
the 3D printer. In this case, training phase can be re-applied
to ensure the eﬀectiveness of the magnetic model.
Ambient Noise Eﬀect: Ambient acoustic and magnetic
noise will aﬀect the performance of the prediction models.
The aﬀected degree is tightly related to the noise level.
Light ambient noise can be removed using speciﬁc ﬁlters,
such as the aforementioned Savitzky-Golay ﬁlter in Section
5.1. Strong, wide-width ambient noise will contaminate the
side channels and can be applied as a potential mitigation
method to decrease the attack performance, which is dis-
cussed in Section 8.2.
Carry-on Attack: Another enhanced practice is the carry-
on attack model.
In this threat model, the attackers can
hind smartphone(s) in his pocket and stand around 3D print-
ers. In Section 6.4, we introduce a solution to project the
side-channel data into the world frame regardless of the
smartphone’s orientation. This feature potentially enables
this new and practical attack scenario. In the future work,
we will evaluate the setup where the attacker places the
smartphone in the pocket and stands or walks around the
printer. The signal variation caused by body motion can be
compensated by the built-in inertial sensors [43].
Advanced Shape Exploration: Due to the elegant con-
cept of layer by layer fabrication, 3D printers can build com-
plicated objects with a wide variety of materials and func-
tions. We plan to evaluate the performance on various de-
signs with a diverse shape complexity, such as circle, ellipse,
arc and complex topology. The challenge on these compli-
cated shapes is to accurately identify the printing state (e.g.,
material extruding or not) because the nozzle motion trajec-
tory will become convoluted. The posted process, such as
layer smooth algorithm (Algorithm 2), needs further pron-
ing.
8. DEFENSE MECHANISM
As shown in Figure 1, the 3D printing chain includes the
software process (e.g., 3D design and G-code generation)
and hardware process (e.g., physical manufacturing). We
propose the possible defense methods in two types, e.g.,
software-based methods and hardware-based methods.
8.1 Software-based Methods
First, we would like to propose two software-based meth-
ods to mitigate the side-channel attacks. We highlight that
these methods do not introduce hardware cost or alter the
conﬁguration of 3D printers.
• Dynamic Path Planning: To protect the 3D print-
ing design IP from training-based attack method, we
propose the dynamic path planning strategy. Gener-
ally, the operation models require an upfront training.
Therefore, to degrade the performance of the predic-
tion models, we adopt dynamic printing conﬁgurations
in the process of G-code generation. For example,
the printing speed for a speciﬁc material has a proper
speed range based on the material’s characteristic. Ap-
plying diﬀerent speed settings within the proper range
in the printing process will maintain the yield but re-
duce the attack accuracy. Diﬀerent temperature set-
tings in the nozzle heater are also be required to match
the printing speed and will further generate additional
interference in the side channels.
• Dummy Task Injection: As described in Section 5,
the successful deduction on nozzle status (print and
align) is determined by the nozzle speed. This model
is based on the convention that nozzle moves faster on
alignment than on printing. Based on this knowledge,
we can consider to inject additional dummy tasks on
purpose to spoof the sensors. Speciﬁcally, the dummy
task comprises a set of random trajectories with the
regular print speed yet no real material extrusion. The
dummy task can be integrated in the process of G-
code generation. This defense approach can increase
the print duration while have little impact on the print
quality.
8.2 Hardware-supported Methods
Second, we discuss the hardware-supported methods to
reduce the IP theft risk. Generally, we need to prevent the
malicious attackers from collecting the valuable side-channel
information.
• Hardware Shielding: The most straightforward strat-
egy to limit the side-channel information emission is
to physically isolate the side-channel sources by hard-
ware shielding. There are a few oﬀ-the-shelf acoustic
and electromagnetic shielding materials [25, 21] which
are capable of eliminating the interference. However,
shielding hardware brings additional hardware cost to
the system and even decreases the operational usabil-
ity in daily use.
• Side Channel Interference: Another hardware-based
solution is to intentionally introduce more interference
to aﬀect the attacker’s sensors. Some home appli-
ances (e.g., refrigerators, air-conditioners) can gener-
ate strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) to dete-
riorate the side-channel quality. Moreover, a few re-
cent studies shows that sound noise can malfunction
the MEMS based sensors [32, 36], which are widely
used in smartphones. However, interference, such as
EMI and sound noise, might raise the potential health
concerns.
9. RELATED WORK
Understanding the vulnerability is the ﬁrst step to build
robust and resilient systems. As an emerging driving force
in manufacturing, security issues in 3D printing have been
raised in the past few years. As aforementioned, 3D print-
ing chain involves both cyber-domain process and physical
domain process. Since 2014, people start to investigate cy-
ber vulnerabilities in the 3D printing chain. For example,
Sturm et al.
[38] examined speciﬁc malwares to conduct
certain malicious operations to the digital ﬁles in the cy-
ber domain and proved that the product yield was aﬀected.
Wells et al. [41] identiﬁed the issue of cyber vulnerability by
designing malicious software to infect, modify or steal STL
ﬁles or tool-path ﬁles.
On the contrary, physical attacks in the 3D printing chain
remain underexplored. Backes et al.
[14] inspected the
acoustic emanations of dot matrix printers. They presented
a side-channel attack method to recover what a dot matrix
2D printer is printing based on the sound record. Al Faruque
et al. [12] demonstrated the acoustic side-channel attack on
3D printing. However, they only considered the cases with
single contour instead of multiple ones. Moreover, both work
employed professional audio equipment in the attacking ap-
proaches. 3D scanning [20, 27] is another technology to re-
construct the digital three-dimensional model by creating a
point cloud of geometric samples on the surface of the ob-
ject. Yet this technology is not capable of inner structure
detection and the scanner, such as Matter And Form 3D
scanner [3], still remains expensive. Also, 3D scanning at-
tack requires the physical access to the 3D objects.
In the era of smart devices and internet of things, phys-
ical domain attacks leveraging cost-eﬃcient and ubiquitous
sensors deserve more attentions.
10. CONCLUSION
3D printing has been hailed as the third industrial revo-
lution in the unique way that products are conceived, de-
signed, manufactured and distributed to end users. How-
ever, there are still many security unknowns about using
3D printers in daily life, which might impose the poten-
tial risk on applied ﬁelds or hinder its applicability to more
IP-sensitive industries.
In this paper, we made the ﬁrst
step to understand the potential vulnerability in the 3D
printing process in daily life. Speciﬁcally, we presented a
smartphone-based side-channel attack that takes inputs of
magnetic and acoustic emanations in the 3D printing pro-
cess, and reconstructed the design object with high accuracy
in regular and complex design inference. As demonstrated
in our study, the IP attack is easy to launch and we discuss
several approaches to mitigate the risk. We hope that the
ﬁnding of this study can serve as the reference to understand
and protect the 3D printer systems.
