### Table 5: Average Mean Translation Error (MTE) of the Reconstructed Rectangle at Different Distances

| Distance (cm) | Average MTE (%) |
|--------------|------------------|
| 20           | 5.87             |
| 30           | 12.94            |
| 40           | 34.45            |

**Explanation:**
The table above shows the average mean translation error (MTE) of the reconstructed rectangle when different distances are applied between the smartphone and the 3D printer. The results indicate that the reconstruction performance deteriorates rapidly as the distance increases, with the MTE reaching as high as 34.45% at a 40 cm distance. However, with the significant advancements in smartphone sensors, higher sensitivity is expected to extend the effective attack range. Additionally, using multiple smartphones for multi-sensor fusion can further enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and address limitations such as distance.

### Print Speed Effect
Print speed is a critical factor affecting the fabrication quality. The optimal print speed is determined by the material's thermoplastic properties. In this study, we used PLA plastic filament, which has a recommended print speed of 180 mm/min. Some emerging materials, such as soft hydrogel, can achieve high-quality prints at very fast speeds. Future work will evaluate the attack approaches at different print speeds. We expect that performance will reach a limit at very high print speeds due to smartphone hardware specifications, such as sampling frequency and sensor sensitivity.

### Position Effect
The smartphone's position has a limited effect on the acoustic signal due to its spherical propagation and fast travel time. However, the absolute magnetic signal changes based on the magnetic field distribution around the 3D printer and the smartphone's position. The directional pattern (Figure 9) may invert if the smartphone is moved to the other side of the 3D printer. In such cases, re-training the model can ensure the effectiveness of the magnetic model.

### Ambient Noise Effect
Ambient acoustic and magnetic noise can affect the performance of the prediction models. The degree of impact is closely related to the noise level. Light ambient noise can be filtered out using specific filters, such as the Savitzky-Golay filter mentioned in Section 5.1. Strong, wide-band ambient noise can contaminate the side channels and potentially serve as a mitigation method to decrease attack performance, as discussed in Section 8.2.

### Carry-on Attack
Another enhanced practice is the carry-on attack model, where attackers can hide smartphones in their pockets and stand near 3D printers. In Section 6.4, we introduced a solution to project side-channel data into the world frame, regardless of the smartphone's orientation. This feature enables a new and practical attack scenario. Future work will evaluate setups where the attacker places the smartphone in a pocket and stands or walks around the printer. Signal variations caused by body motion can be compensated for using built-in inertial sensors [43].

### Advanced Shape Exploration
Due to the layer-by-layer fabrication concept, 3D printers can build complex objects with a variety of materials and functions. We plan to evaluate the performance on various designs with diverse shape complexities, such as circles, ellipses, arcs, and complex topologies. The challenge with these shapes is accurately identifying the printing state (e.g., material extrusion) because the nozzle motion trajectory becomes more convoluted. Post-processing, such as the layer smooth algorithm (Algorithm 2), needs further refinement.

### Defense Mechanism

#### Software-based Methods
1. **Dynamic Path Planning:**
   To protect 3D printing design IP from training-based attacks, we propose a dynamic path planning strategy. By varying printing configurations, such as print speed and temperature settings, within the proper range during G-code generation, we can maintain print quality while reducing attack accuracy.

2. **Dummy Task Injection:**
   As described in Section 5, successful deduction of nozzle status (print and align) is based on nozzle speed. Injecting additional dummy tasks, consisting of random trajectories with regular print speed but no real material extrusion, can spoof the sensors. This approach can be integrated into the G-code generation process, increasing print duration with minimal impact on print quality.

#### Hardware-supported Methods
1. **Hardware Shielding:**
   The most straightforward method to limit side-channel information emission is physical isolation using hardware shielding. Off-the-shelf acoustic and electromagnetic shielding materials can eliminate interference, but they add hardware costs and may reduce operational usability.

2. **Side Channel Interference:**
   Introducing intentional interference, such as strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) from home appliances, can degrade side-channel quality. Recent studies show that sound noise can also malfunction MEMS-based sensors in smartphones. However, EMI and sound noise may raise potential health concerns.

### Related Work
Understanding vulnerabilities is the first step in building robust and resilient systems. Security issues in 3D printing have been raised in recent years, involving both cyber and physical domains. Since 2014, researchers have investigated cyber vulnerabilities, such as Sturm et al. [38] and Wells et al. [41]. Physical attacks, however, remain underexplored. Backes et al. [14] and Al Faruque et al. [12] demonstrated acoustic side-channel attacks on 2D and 3D printers, respectively, but used professional audio equipment. 3D scanning, while useful for surface reconstruction, is not capable of inner structure detection and remains expensive. In the era of smart devices and the Internet of Things, physical domain attacks leveraging cost-effective and ubiquitous sensors deserve more attention.

### Conclusion
3D printing has been hailed as the third industrial revolution, but there are still many security unknowns. In this paper, we presented a smartphone-based side-channel attack that reconstructs design objects with high accuracy using magnetic and acoustic emanations. The ease of launching such IP attacks highlights the need for mitigation strategies. We hope our findings serve as a reference for understanding and protecting 3D printer systems.
