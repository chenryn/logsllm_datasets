When exporting a node's properties using the `neo4j-shell` command (e.g., `start p=node(1) return p;`), the data within the curly braces `{...}` appears to follow the JSON format. However, if a property value contains double quotes (`"`), these are not properly escaped. This can cause issues when attempting to parse the property data with JSON libraries.

To clarify, the problem arises because unescaped double quotes within the property values violate the JSON standard, leading to parsing errors in most JSON parsers. 

For example, consider a node with a property value that includes double quotes:

```json
{
  "name": "John "Doe""
}
```

In this case, the double quote within the name should be escaped as follows to be valid JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "John \"Doe\""
}
```

To resolve this issue, you may need to preprocess the output from `neo4j-shell` to ensure that all double quotes within property values are properly escaped before parsing the data with JSON libraries.
