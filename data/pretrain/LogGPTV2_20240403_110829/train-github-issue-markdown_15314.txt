 **Migrated issue, originally created by David Lord (@davidism)**
`as_declarative` has been removed from the top level module between 0.9.8 and
0.9.9. This no longer works:
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import as_declarative
Instead, this is required:
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative.api import as_declarative
This seems to be an unintended change, as there's no reason for it to have
been removed, and there's no mention in the changelog.
