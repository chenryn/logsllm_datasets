The following syntax:
Model.query.filter('table_name.column_name % 'query_string'').all()
will generate a correct sql expression, except by the percentage sign, which
will be duplicated, rendering: "model.column_name %% 'query_string'".
This duplication is unavoidable so far as I know by the docs, but it should be
possible to provide literal SQL to the filter clause, in order to not disturb
code which dynamically relies on concatenation of filters.
The above % syntax is compatible with posgres fuzzy search module.
