    does the browser behave. To get a list of the actual `prefs` you can go to
    `chrome://prefs-internals`, there you can get the code you need to tweak.
    ```python
    options = ChromeOptions()
    options.add_experimental_option(
        "prefs",
        {
            "profile.default_content_setting_values.images": 2,
        },
    )
    ```
### [Typer](typer.md)
* New: [Create a `--version` command.](typer.md#create-a---version-command-)
    You could use a callback to implement a `--version` CLI option.
    It would show the version of your CLI program and then it would terminate it.
    Even before any other CLI parameter is processed.
    ```python
    from typing import Optional
    import typer
    __version__ = "0.1.0"
    def version_callback(value: bool) -> None:
        """Print the version of the program."""
        if value:
            print(f"Awesome CLI Version: {__version__}")
            raise typer.Exit()
    def main(
        version: Optional[bool] = typer.Option(
            None, "--version", callback=version_callback, is_eager=True
        ),
    ) -> None:
        ...
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        typer.run(main)
    ```
* New: [Testing.](typer.md#testing)
    Testing is similar to [`click` testing](click.md#testing-click-applications),
    but you import the `CliRunner` directly from `typer`:
    ```python
    from typer.testing import CliRunner
    ```
## [Sponsor](sponsor.md)
* New: Introduce sponsorship analysis.
    It may arrive the moment in your life where
    [someone wants to sponsor you](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix/issues/185#issuecomment-1329276169).
    There are many sponsoring platforms you can use, each has their advantages and
    disadvantages.
    - Liberapay.
    - Ko-fi.
    - Buy me a coffee.
    - Github Sponsor.

    [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com) is the only
    [non-profit](https://en.liberapay.com/about/faq#differences) recurrent donations
    platform. It's been the most recommended platform from the people I know from
    the open-source, activist environment.
    [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/) would be my next choice, as they don't do
    commissions on the donations and they support more features (that I don't need
    right now) than Liberapay.
# [DevOps](ombi.md)
* New: Introduce Ombi.
    [Ombi](https://ombi.io/) is a self-hosted web application that automatically
    gives your shared Jellyfin users the ability to request content by themselves!
    Ombi can be linked to multiple TV Show and Movie DVR tools to create a seamless
    end-to-end experience for your users.
    If Ombi is not for you, you may try [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/).
## Infrastructure Solutions
### [AWS Savings plan](aws_savings_plan.md)
* New: Introduce AWS Savings plan.
    [Saving plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/what-is-savings-plans.html)
    offer a flexible pricing model that provides savings on AWS usage.
    You can save up to 72 percent on your AWS compute workloads.
    !!! note "Please don't make Jeff Bezos even richer, try to pay as less money to
    AWS as you can."
## [Continuous Integration](mdformat.md)
* New: Introduce MDFormat.
    [MDFormat](https://mdformat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an opinionated
    Markdown formatter that can be used to enforce a consistent style in Markdown
    files. Mdformat is a Unix-style command-line tool as well as a Python library.
    The features/opinions of the formatter include:
    * Consistent indentation and whitespace across the board
    * Always use ATX style headings
    * Move all link references to the bottom of the document (sorted by label)
    * Reformat indented code blocks as fenced code blocks
    * Use 1. as the ordered list marker if possible, also for noninitial list items.
    It's based on the
    [`markdown-it-py`](https://markdown-it-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    Markdown parser, which is a Python implementation of
    [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).
* New: [Issues.](mdformat.md#issues)
    - It doesn't yet
      [support admonitions](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/309)
    - You can't
      [ignore some files](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/359),
      nor
      [some part of the file](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/53)
## Hardware
### [CPU](cpu.md)
* Correction: Add GPU advice on shopping tips.
    * Check that the CPU has GPU if you don't want to use an external graphic card.
        Otherwise the BIOS won't start.
### [Pedal PC](pedal_pc.md)
* New: Introduce Pedal PC.
    The Pedal PC idea gathers crazy projects that try to use the energy of your
    pedaling while you are working on your PC. The most interesting is
    [PedalPC](https://www.pedalpc.com/), but still crazy.
    [Pedal-Power](http://pedal-power.com/) is another similar project, although it
    looks unmaintained.
# Operating Systems
## Linux
### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)
* New: [Df and du showing different results.](linux_snippets.md#df-and-du-showing-different-results)
    Sometimes on a linux machine you will notice that both `df` command (display
    free disk space) and `du` command (display disk usage statistics) report
    different output. Usually, `df` will output a bigger disk usage than `du`.
    The `du` command estimates file space usage, and the `df` command shows file
    system disk space usage.
    There are many reasons why this could be happening:
    * [Disk mounted over data](linux_snippets.md#disk-mounted-over-data)
    * [Used deleted files](linux_snippets.md#used-deleted-files)
* New: [Clean up docker data.](linux_snippets.md#clean-up-docker-data)
    To remove unused `docker` data you can run `docker system prune -a`. This will
    remove:
    - All stopped containers
    - All networks not used by at least one container
    - All images without at least one container associated to them
    - All build cache
    Sometimes that's not enough, and your `/var/lib/docker` directory still weights
    more than it should. In those cases:
    - Stop the `docker` service.
    - Remove or move the data to another directory
    - Start the `docker` service.
    In order not to loose your persisted data, you need to configure your dockers to
    mount the data from a directory that's not within `/var/lib/docker`.
### [aleph](aleph.md)
* New: Introduce Aleph.
    [Aleph](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph) is a tool for indexing large amounts
    of both documents (PDF, Word, HTML) and structured (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy
    browsing and search. It is built with investigative reporting as a primary use
    case. Aleph allows cross-referencing mentions of well-known entities (such as
    people and companies) against watchlists, e.g. from prior research or public
    datasets.
* New: [Problems accessing redis locally.](aleph.md#problems-accessing-redis-locally)
    If you're with the VPN connected, turn it off.
* New: [PDB behaves weird.](aleph.md#pdb-behaves-weird)
    Sometimes you have two traces at the same time, so each time you run a PDB
    command it jumps from pdb trace. Quite confusing. Try to `c` the one you don't
    want so that you're left with the one you want. Or put the `pdb` trace in a
    conditional that only matches one of both threads.
### [elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md)
* New: [Searching documents.](elasticsearch.md#searching-documents)
    We use HTTP requests to talk to ElasticSearch. A HTTP request is made up of
    several components such as the URL to make the request to, HTTP verbs (GET, POST
    etc) and headers. In order to succinctly and consistently describe HTTP requests
    the ElasticSearch documentation uses cURL command line syntax. This is also the
    standard practice to describe requests made to ElasticSearch within the user
    community.
    An example HTTP request using CURL syntax looks like this:
    ```bash
    curl -XPOST "https://localhost:9200/_search" -d' { "query": { "match_all": {} }
    }'
    ```
* New: [Get documents that match a string.](elasticsearch.md#get-documents-that-match-a-string)
    ```bash
    curl \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -XPOST "https://localhost:9200/_search" \
        -d' { "query": { "query_string": {"query": "test company"} }}'
    ```
### [ferdium](ferdium.md)
* New: Introduce ferdium.
    [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org) is a desktop application to have all your
    services in one place. It's similar to Rambox, Franz or Ferdi only that it's
    maintained by the community and respects your privacy.
### [finnix](finnix.md)
* New: Introduce finnix.
    [Finnix](https://www.finnix.org/) is a live Linux distribution specialized in
    the recovery, maintenance, testing of systems.
### [VSCodium](vscodium.md)
* New: Introduce VSCodium.
    [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) are binary releases of VS Code
    without MS branding/telemetry/licensing.
## Android
### [Android Tips](android_tips.md)
* New: [Extend the life of your battery.](android_tips.md#extend-the-life-of-your-battery)
    [Research](https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210224725-Charging-research-and-methodology)
    has shown that keeping your battery charged between 0% and 80% can make your
    battery's lifespan last 2x longer than when you use a full battery cycle from
    0-100%.
    As a non root user you can
    [install Accubattery](https://www.getdroidtips.com/custom-battery-charge-limit-android/)
    (not in F-droid :( ) to get an alarm when the battery reaches 80% so that you
    can manually unplug it. Instead of leaving the mobile charge in the night and
    stay connected at 100% a lot of hours until you unplug, charge it throughout the
    day.
### [GrapheneOS](grapheneos.md)
* New: Introduce GrapheneOS.
    [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is a private and secure mobile operating
    system with Android app compatibility. Developed as a non-profit open source
    project.
* New: Introduce GrapheneOS.
    GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system with great
    functionality and usability. It starts from the strong baseline of the Android
    Open Source Project (AOSP) and takes great care to avoid increasing attack
    surface or hurting the strong security model. GrapheneOS makes substantial
    improvements to both privacy and security through many carefully designed
    features built to function against real adversaries. The project cares a lot
    about usability and app compatibility so those are taken into account for all of
    our features.

* Correction: Update http versions to `HTTP/2.0`.
    It seems that the correct protocol is HTTP/2.0 now:
