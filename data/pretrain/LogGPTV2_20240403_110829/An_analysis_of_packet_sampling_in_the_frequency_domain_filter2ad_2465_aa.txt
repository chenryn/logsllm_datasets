ABSTRACT
Packet sampling techniques introduce measurement errors
that should be carefully handled in order to correctly charac-
terize the network behavior. In the literature several works
have studied the statistical properties of packet sampling
and the way it should be inverted to recover the original
network measurements. Here we take the new direction of
studying the spectral properties of packet sampled traﬃc. A
novel technique to model the impact of packet sampling is
proposed based on a theoretical analysis of network traﬃc
in the frequency domain. Moreover, a real-time algorithm is
also presented to detect the spectrum portion of the network
traﬃc that can be restored once packet sampling has been
applied. Preliminary experimental results are reported to
validate the proposed approach.

INTRODUCTION
Packet sampling techniques are very useful to reduce the
complexity of network monitoring systems [5, 6]. They sim-
ply consist on capturing a subset of packets, which are then
used to infer the original traﬃc properties. Packet sampling
is known to introduce estimation errors that should be very

carefully handled in order to correctly characterize the net-
work behavior [13]. This problem has been faced by the
scientiﬁc community in recent years and many novel analy-
sis and sampling techniques have been proposed, e.g., [7, 8,
15, 10, 16, 4, 11].
These previous works, among others, have shed the light
on many of the statistical properties of packet sampling.
Several inversion methods 1 have followed combining sto-
chastic analysis and statistical inference. In this paper, we
look at packet sampling from another interesting perspec-
tive, that of the spectral density of the traﬃc bit rate aver-
aged over some time intervals, called bins, and tracked over
time. In fact, the traﬃc is not ﬁxed, but varies over time
forming a signal composed of several frequencies. We try
to evaluate the parts of the spectrum that get altered be-
cause of sampling and identify eﬃcient non-biased inversion
methods. Our target is not only the volume of the traﬃc
or its marginal distribution at some time instant, but rather
how many frequencies we can still recover after sampling.
This way we can make sure that the main frequencies in
the original traﬃc are preserved, which is of major impor-
tance for applications like anomaly detection and network
tomography [3, 14, 1]. By the help of Fourier Transforms,
we develop an original theoretical framework able to explain
the impact of packet sampling on the traﬃc spectral density.
In particular, the error in the estimation of the traﬃc volume
is modeled as an aliasing eﬀect in the frequency domain [17].
Moreover, by leveraging the theoretical analysis, a real-time
algorithm is also designed to detect the spectrum portion of
the network traﬃc signal that can be restored once packet
sampling has been applied. Preliminary experimental re-
sults are reported to validate the proposed approach.
The rest of the work is organized as follows: Sec. 2 overviews
the related work; Sec. 3 formulates the problem of estimat-
ing the binned traﬃc rate in the frequency domain; in Sec. 4
the eﬀects of packet sampling are modeled; in Sec. 5 a ﬁlter-
bank is proposed to process a stream of sampled packets and
to estimate the portion of the spectrum of the original traﬃc
that can be restored; Sec. 6 shows preliminary experimental
results; ﬁnally the last section draws conclusions and future
research.

2. RELATED WORK
We review the body of the literature relevant to our dis-
cussion. In [7] a method is proposed that allows the direct

ments.

subset of all packets traversing a domain. The key idea is
to sample packets based on a hash function computed over
the packet content. Using the same hash function yields the
same sample set of packets in the entire domain, and enables
the reconstruction of packet trajectories. The approach al-
lows also to cope with unreliable report transport.
[8] focuses on the frequencies at which diﬀerent numbers
of packets per ﬂow occur. In particular, the paper: (i) shows
how to smooth the estimated ﬂow size distribution in order
to deal with short ﬂows that disappear; (ii) uses maximum
likelihood estimation to derive the full distribution of packet
and byte ﬂow lengths; (iii) exploits protocol level details to
render the estimators more accurate.
In [9] a method for sampling ﬂow records on some router
interface is proposed. It is based on a threshold-based sam-
pling strategy that sets the sampling probability according
to the size of the ﬂow record. The theoretical properties
of the estimator have been derived. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that the algorithm has an accuracy slightly
smaller than a modiﬁed version of the sample and hold algo-
rithm proposed in [10]. Finally, several strategies to dynam-
ically control the volume of the sampled traﬃc are proposed
and compared.
In [15] the Sketch Guided Sampling (SGS) has been pro-
posed.
It sets the packet sampling probability according
to an estimate of the size of the ﬂow the packet belongs
to. This translates into an increase in the packet sampling
rate of the small and medium ﬂows at slight expense of the
large ﬂows, resulting in much more accurate estimations of
various network statistics. Other interesting proposals have
been conceived to deal with large ﬂows [2, 10, 16, 4, 11].
[13] demonstrates that it is impossible in practice to re-
cover the spectral density of the packet arrival process and
the distribution of the number of packets per ﬂow using tra-
ditional packet based sampling. Thus, it proposes to sample
ﬂows rather than packets in order to achieve higher accuracy
at the expense of an increased computational complexity.
3. PROBLEM FORMULATION IN THE FRE-
QUENCY DOMAIN
Our objective is to estimate the amount of data sent from
a sender node (S) to a receiver node (R) during consecutive
time intervals of duration T , which will be referred to as bins.
A node can be a net or a subnet with some IP address preﬁx,
a domain, an edge router, etc. The estimation is carried
out using packet sampling, i.e., each packet is captured with
a uniform probability p. Packets captured during the same
bin are summed together, then the resulting binned value is
tracked over time to understand the traﬃc behavior.
To model the spectral density of the traﬃc signal, we di-
vide the time axis into small time slots with size t0.
In
each slot, no more than one packet can be transmitted. In
practice, this t0 corresponds to the transmission time of the
smallest packet over the monitored link. We deﬁne d(k)
as the amount of data sent by S during the time interval
[(k) · t0, (k + 1) · t0[, where k ∈ N . To be more precise, if
the transmission of an entire packet has been accomplished
during the time interval [(k) · t0, (k + 1) · t0[, d(k) will be
equal to the size of the sent packet, otherwise d(k) will be
equal to 0. Moreover, we take the bin size T to be an integer
multiple of t0, i.e., T is made by T /t0 slots. The expected

where D(f ) is the Fourier Transform of d(k) and D0(f ) = 0,

t0 . This expression has a general validity because
the spectrum of any discrete-time signal is periodic with
period equal to 1/t0, if the time between two subsequent
samples is equal to t0. Basically, D0(f ) is a function that
we introduce and that includes all frequencies of the signal
d(k) in the interval [−0.5/t0, +0.5/t0]. Moreover, we deﬁne
fM , fM ≤ 0.5
t0 , as the maximum frequency of the spectrum
D0(f ). To better clarify the meaning of our notation, Fig.
1 pictures a typical example for E[D(f )].
As ﬁrst step, we model the spectrum of the traﬃc signal
under the ideal assumption of capturing all packets, i.e.,
p = 1. Given that the measurement bin lasts T /t0 time slots,
summing the data received in a bin time can be expressed as
ﬁltering d(k) using a discrete-time ﬁlter with pulse response
h(k) = 1 for k = 0 . . . T /t0 − 1, and h(k) = 0 for k ≥ T /t0.
The corresponding transfer function is:
−jπf ( T

−1)t0 · sin(πf T )/sin(πf t0).
H(f ) = e
(2)
H(f ) is a low-pass ﬁlter with cutoﬀ bandwidth B ≈ 0.445
and static gain equal to T /t0 [12]. Moreover, it is worth
noting that the spectrum of H(f ) is periodic (with period
1/t0) because the corresponding pulse response is discrete.
Thus, H(f ) acts as a low-pass ﬁlter in the frequency band
[−0.5/t0, 0.5/t0].2 To provide a further insight into the ﬁl-
ter H(f ), Fig. 2 plots the module of its transfer function
obtained for t0 = 1s and T = 10s.

Being H(f ) a linear ﬁlter, it holds that the expected Fourier
Transform of ¯d(k), the ﬁltered version of the traﬃc signal
d(k), is:

where ¯D0(f ) = t0
. The last equality in Eq. (3)
holds because both H(f ) and E[D(f )] are periodic functions
with the same period 1/t0. Fig. 3 plots an approximated
model of E[ ¯D(f )].

Now, we present our approach to move from a discrete-
time signal representation to a continuous-time one. This
is shown in Fig. 4: the signal ¯d(k) is decimated by a factor

T /t0, i.e., one sample of ¯d(k) is taken every bin, then the
resulting signal ¯dT (k) is processed with Zero Order Holder
(ZOH), which is a device that keeps the output ˆd(t) equal
to the last received sample. Using the Poisson summation
formula [17], the expected spectrum of ¯dT (k), i.e., the deci-
mated version of ¯d(k), is:

It is worth noting that the spectrum E[ ¯DT (f )] is the sum
T ), which are obtained by translating

T and by dividing the result
t0
by T /t0. As a consequence, and given that the bandwidth of
¯D0(f ) is B ≈ 0.445
[12], the decimation does not introduce
aliasing. Moreover, the transfer function of the ZOH is:
T
GZOH (f ) = e−jπf T · sin(πf T )/(πf T ),
(5)
which is a low-pass ﬁlter with unitary static gain and band-
width equal to that of H(f ). With respect to H(f ), the
ZOH is also able to ﬁlter out all high frequency components
of the input signal, so that, the expected spectrum of the
continuous-time signal ˆd(t) is no more periodic and can be
expressed as follows:
E[ ˆD(f )] = GZOH (f )E[ ¯DT (f )] ≈ GZOH (f ) ¯D0(f ).
(6)
This is no other than a low-pass ﬁltered version of the base-
band component of the expected spectrum of d(k). The
signal ˆd(t) is the binned traﬃc rate that network operators
track over time for management and monitoring purposes,
thus our aim is to evaluate the impact of packet sampling
on the spectrum of this signal and to propose conservative
values for T and p to be used. Note that most of the diﬃculty
comes from the fact that the spectrum of the original signal
d(k) is unknown from sampled traﬃc.
