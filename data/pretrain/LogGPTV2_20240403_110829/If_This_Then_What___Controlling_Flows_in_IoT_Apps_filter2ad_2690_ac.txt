### Analysis of IFTTT Applets

We use the security classification for triggers and actions to study public applets on the IFTTT platform and identify potential security and privacy risks. Specifically, we evaluate the number of privacy violations (insecure flows from Private triggers to Public actions), integrity violations (insecure flows from all triggers to Untrusted actions), and availability violations (insecure flows from Available triggers to Available actions).

- **Privacy Violations**: 35% of IFTTT applets use Private triggers, and 88% use Public actions. Approximately 30% of IFTTT applets are susceptible to privacy violations, affecting around 8 million users. Most of these applets (99%) are designed by third-party makers.

- **Integrity Violations**: 98% of the applets (used by more than 18 million users) are susceptible to integrity violations. These violations can cause damage by manipulating data or temporarily disabling devices.

- **Availability Violations**: 0.5% (1,461 applets) are susceptible to availability violations, which can also harm users and devices.

### Heatmaps of Security Violations

**Figure 10: Heatmap of Privacy Violations**

- **Categories with High Vulnerability**: Social networks, email, location, calendars & scheduling, and cloud storage.
- **Common Combinations**: Social networks-social networks (27,716 applets), social networks-cloud storage (5,163 applets), social networks-blogging (4,097 applets), and email-cloud storage (2,330 applets).

**Figure 11: Heatmap of Integrity Violations**

- **Categories with High Vulnerability**: Environment control & monitoring, mobile devices & accessories, security & monitoring systems, and voice assistants.
- **Common Combinations**: Calendars & scheduling-notifications (3,108 applets), voice assistants-notifications (547 applets), environment control & monitoring-notifications (467 applets), and smart hubs & systems-notifications (124 applets).

### Countermeasures

#### 5.1 Per-Applet Access Control

- **Proposal**: Implement a per-applet access control policy to classify applets as private or public, restricting their sources and sinks to either exclusively private or public data.
- **Implementation**: Service providers can define and communicate the security classification during service integration. IFTTT can provide a well-defined API for this purpose.
- **Prevention of URL Attacks**: Ensure that applets cannot build URLs from strings, using sanitization APIs and CSRF-like tokens to prevent linking to attacker servers.

#### 5.2 Authenticated Communication

- **Issue**: The unauthenticated communication between IFTTT and the actionâ€™s service provider allows for upload attacks.
- **Solution**: Authenticate the communication using private URLs accessible only to authenticated services.

#### 5.3 Unavoidable Public URLs

- **Recommendation**: Avoid randomized URLs whenever possible. For example, embed images directly in emails rather than linking to them.

By implementing these countermeasures, we can significantly reduce the risk of privacy, integrity, and availability violations in IFTTT applets.
