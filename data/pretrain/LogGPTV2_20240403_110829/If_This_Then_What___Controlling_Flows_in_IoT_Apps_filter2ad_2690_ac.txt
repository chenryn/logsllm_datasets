actions, on the other hand, can always be skipped. We have noticed
that certain IoT service providers only allow user-chosen actions,
possible evidence for their awareness on potential integrity attacks.
As reported in Figure 9, Public actions using image tags and links
appear in IFTTT categories such as social networks, cloud storage,
email or bookmarking, and Untrusted actions appear in many IoT-
related categories such as environment control & monitoring, security
& monitoring systems, or smart hubs & systems.
Results. Our analysis shows that 35% of IFTTT applets use Private
triggers and 88% use Public actions. Moreover, 98% of IFTTT applets
use actions labeled as Untrusted.
4.3 Analyzing IFTTT applets
We use the security classification for triggers and actions to study
public applets on the IFTTT platform and identify potential security
and privacy risks. More specifically, we evaluate the number of
privacy violations (insecure flows from Private triggers to Public
actions), integrity violations (insecure flows from all triggers to
Untrusted actions), and availability violations (insecure flows from
Available triggers to Available actions). The analysis shows that
30% of IFTTT applets from our dataset are susceptible to privacy
violations, and they are installed by circa 8 million IFTTT users.
Moreover, we observe that 99% of these applets are designed by
third-party makers, i.e., applet makers other than IFTTT or official
service vendors. We remark that this is a very serious concern
due to the stealthy nature of the attacks against applets’ users (cf.
Section 3). We also observe that 98% of the applets (installed by more
than 18 million IFTTT users) are susceptible to integrity violations
and 0.5% (1461 applets) are susceptible to availability violations.
While integrity and availability violations are not stealthy, they
can cause damage to users and devices, e.g., by manipulating the
information stored on a Google Spreadsheet or by temporarily
disabling a surveillance camera.
Privacy violations. Figure 10 displays the heatmap of IFTTT ap-
plets with Private triggers (x-axis) and Public actions (y-axis) for
each category. The color of a trigger-action category pair indicates
the percentage of applets susceptible to privacy violations, as fol-
lows: red indicates 100% of the applets, while bright yellow indicates
less than 20% of the applets. We observe that the majority of vulner-
able applets use Private triggers from social networks, email, location,
calendars & scheduling and cloud storage, and Public actions from
social networks, cloud storage, email, and notes. The most frequent
combinations of Private trigger-Public action categories are social
networks-social networks with 27,716 applets, social networks-cloud
storage with 5,163 applets, social networks-blogging with 4,097 ap-
plets, and email-cloud storage with 2,330 applets, with a total of
~40,000 applets. Table 1 in the Appendix reports popular IFTTT
applets by third-party makers susceptible to privacy violations.
Integrity violations. Similarly, Figure 11 displays the heatmap of
applets susceptible to integrity violations. In contrast to privacy vi-
olations, more IFTTT applets are potentially vulnerable to integrity
violations, including different categories of IoT devices, e.g., environ-
ment control & monitoring, mobile devices & accessories, security &
monitoring systems, and voice assistants. Interesting combinations of
triggers-Untrusted actions are calendars & scheduling-notifications
with 3,108 applets, voice assistants-notifications with 547 applets,
environment control & monitoring-notifications with 467 applets,
and smart hubs & systems-notifications with 124 applets.
Availability violations. Finally, we analyze the applets suscepti-
ble to availability violations. The results show that many existing
applets in the categories of security & monitoring systems, smart
hubs & systems, environment control & monitoring, and connected
car could potentially implement such attacks, and may harm both
users and devices. Table 2 in the Appendix displays popular IoT ap-
plets by third-party makers susceptible to integrity and availability
violations.
5 COUNTERMEASURES: BREAKING THE
FLOW
The attacks in Section 3 demonstrate that the access control mecha-
nism implemented by the IFTTT platform can be circumvented by
malicious applet makers. The root cause of privacy violations is the
flow of information from private sources to public sinks, as lever-
aged by URL-based attacks. Furthermore, full trust in the applet
makers to manipulate user data correctly enables integrity and avail-
ability attacks. Additionally, the use of shortened URLs with short
random strings served over HTTP opens up for brute-force pri-
vacy and integrity attacks. This section discusses countermeasures
against such attacks, based on breaking insecure flows through
tighter access controls. Our suggested solutions are backward com-
patible with the existing IFTTT model.
5.1 Per-applet access control
We suggest a per-applet access control policy to either classify an
applet as private or public and thereby restrict its sources and sinks
to either exclusively private or exclusively public data. As such, this
discipline breaks the flow from private to public, thus preventing
privacy attacks.
Implementing such a solution requires a security classification
for triggers and actions similar to the one proposed in Section 4.2.
The classification can be defined by service providers and communi-
cated to IFTTT during service integration with the platform. IFTTT
exposes a well-defined API to the service providers to help them
integrate their online service with the platform. The communica-
tion is handled via REST APIs over HTTP(S) using JSON or XML.
Alternatively, the security classification can be defined directly by
IFTTT, e.g., by checking if the corresponding service requires user
authorization/consent. This would enable automatic classification
of services such as Weather and Location as public and private,
respectively.
URL attacks in private applets can be prevented by ensuring that
applets cannot build URLs from strings, thus disabling possibilities
of linking to attacker’s server. This can be achieved by providing
safe output encoding through sanitization APIs such that the only
way to include links or image markup on the sink is through the
use of API constructors generated by IFTTT. For the safe encoding
not to be bypassed in practice, we suggest using a mechanism
similar to CSRF tokens, where links and image markups include a
random nonce (from a set of nonces parameterized over), so that
the output encoding mechanism sanitizes away all image markups
and links that do not have the desired nonce. Moreover, custom
images like logos in email notifications can still be allowed by
delegating the choice of external links to the users during applet
installation, or disabling their access in the filter code. On the
other hand, generating arbitrary URLs in public applets can still be
allowed.
Integrity and availability attacks can be prevented in a similar
fashion by disabling the access to sensitive actions via JavaScript
in the filter code, or in hidden ingredient parameters, and delegat-
ing the action’s choice to the user. This would prevent integrity
attacks on surveillance cameras through resetting the recording
time, and availability attacks on baby monitors through disabling
the notification action.
5.2 Authenticated communication
IFTTT uses Content Delivery Networks (CDN), e.g., IFTTT or Face-
book servers, to store images, videos, and documents before passing
them to the corresponding services via public random URLs. As
shown in Section 3, the disclosure of such URLs allows for upload
attacks. The gist of URL upload attacks is the unauthenticated com-
munication between IFTTT and the action’s service provider at
the time of upload. This enables the attacker to provide the data
to the action’s service in a stealthy manner. By authenticating the
communication between the service provider and CDN, the upload
attack could be prevented. This can be achieved by using private
URLs which are accessible only to authenticated services.
5.3 Unavoidable public URLs
As mentioned, we advocate avoiding randomized URLs whenever
possible. For example, an email with a location map may actually
include an embedded image rather than linking to the image on a
