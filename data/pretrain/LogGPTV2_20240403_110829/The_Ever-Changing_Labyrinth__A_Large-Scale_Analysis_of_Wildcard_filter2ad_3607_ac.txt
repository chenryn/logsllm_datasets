on the pages lead to the advertisements which are also
changing for each visit. We do not ﬁnd any false positive
under .ren, .link, .party and .click. The FPR for
all domains is 0.8%, suggesting that our detector is quite
effective.
4.3 Detection Result
As shown in Table 1, the number of wildcard DNS do-
mains and SEO domains distributes unevenly across dif-
ferent TLDs and SLDs. We elaborate our ﬁndings for old
TLDs, new gTLDs and generic SLDs separately below:
Old TLD. Among old TLDs open for general registra-
tion, including .cc, .pw, .com and .cn, we observe a
large number of wildcard DNS domains taking unneg-
ligible portion (ranging from 9% to 66%). The num-
ber of wildcard DNS domains abused for spider pool
is also large, consisting of more than 200K .cn , 30K
.com, 10K .cc and 40K .pw domains. The ratio of SEO
domains under .pw (17.7%) is much higher than other
TLDs. It is reported that .pw domains are extensively
used for email spam [38] and our result shows they are
also favored by SEOers. To the opposite, due to more
restricted controls, only a small ratio of .gov and .edu
domains 9 supports wildcard DNS and we have not found
any SEO domain among them.
New gTLD. Since ICANN launched the new gTLD pro-
gram in 2011, the TLD space has been expanded un-
precedentedly. There are more than 1,000 gTLDs rolled
out already, comparing to dozens of gTLDs before 2011.
The delegated registrars under these TLDs frequently
9The number of .edu and .gov domains we have collected is much
less than other TLDs, but our result is still meaningful, as it represents
49% and 22% domains known to the public [12].
promote their domain registration business through dis-
counts, which have attracted a large volume of registra-
tion [21]. For example, around 1.7 million domains have
been registered under .xyz. However, it was also re-
ported that some new gTLDs were ill-managed, lead-
ing to a large number of spam/malware domains regis-
tered [19]. Our research supports this ﬁnding to some
extent. We have identiﬁed 137K SEO domains already
and 8 out of 10 new gTLDs have seen more than 1K SEO
domains.
Generic SLD. Similar to TLDs, a generic SLD usually
represents domains used for the same general purpose or
is managed by a central institute. We have picked 3 out of
7 generic SLDs under .cn for study [9]. Similar to .gov
and .edu, domain registration and resell under .edu.cn
and .gov.cn are tightly controlled. We did not iden-
tify any spider pool domains under .edu.cn, but were
able to capture a small amount of SEO domains under
.gov.cn. It is nevertheless surprising to capture more
than 20K SEO domains (28.1%) under .ac.cn, which
represents the research institutes in China. The domain
registration is managed by Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) and Xinnet and the applicant must prove that she
represents a valid research institute. We speculate that
the registration policies are not fully enforced and urge
authorities to harden the registration process.
5 Measurement
As revealed from the large-scale DNS probing, the num-
ber of domains used for spider pool SEO is massive. In
this section, we ﬁrst measure the infrastructure charac-
teristics (i.e., IP and location distribution, domain regis-
trars and registrant distribution) to study how attackers’

resources are aligned. Then, to extend our understanding
on spider pool business model, we sample SEO domains
detected from DNS scanning and use 20 of them as seeds
to identify new spider pool campaigns. We show detailed
results regarding their customers and impact on search
engines. We elaborate our ﬁndings as follows.
5.1 SEO Domains
We ﬁrst evaluate how SEO domains are distributed
among spider pools’ hosting infrastructure and how they
are registered. Then we selected one spider pool SSP and
monitored the changes of its SEO domains for one month
to measure the dynamics.
IP distribution.
Our ﬁrst question is whether dis-
tributed hosting is a popular design choice, since such
a structure seems to be more resilient against adminis-
trative take-down actions. We issued DNS queries to
all 458,246 SEO domains described in Section 4.1 af-
ter they were detected. Except the domains that were
unresolvable to these queries, we obtained 28,443 IP ad-
dresses associated with 434,731 domains in total. Then,
we use the API provided by ip-api.com 10 to retrieve
their ASN (AS number) and country information. The
answer turns out to be positive, as over 28K IPs have
been identiﬁed and each IP hosted less than 16 domains
on average. But on the other hand, the adversaries prefer
to assign a large number of SEO domains to certain ASs
(autonomous systems), probably for the purpose of re-
ducing the management cost. We obtained ASNs for all
28K IPs and listed the top 10 ASNs sorted by the num-
ber of hosted domains in Table 2.
It shows that more
than 87.6% of all domains (381,041 out of all 434,731)
were hosted on these top 10 ASNs and the topmost ASN,
AS6939, hosted nearly 95K domains (21.7%).
Next, we look into geo-locations of the hosts, trying to
identify if adversaries prefer certain countries to run the
operations. It turns out that most of the domains (80.5%
over all 434,731 domains) and IP addresses (80.7% of
28,443 IPs) were hosted in United States, as shown in Ta-
ble 3. In contrast, only 4.5% domains are hosted within

China, though most of the spider pool campaigns we
have encountered were targeting markets in China. The
reason for this arrangement, we speculate, is to avoid
interventions from local governments including server
take-downs and seizures.
Domain registration. Furthermore, we inspect the in-
formation regarding how the SEO domains are regis-
tered. We queried the TLD Whois servers for registrar,
registrant and registration dates about the 458,246 SEO
domains. In total, we were able to get valid Whois infor-
mation for 425,345 domains. We describe our ﬁndings
below.
Similar to the distribution on ASNs, most of the
SEO domains are offered by a small amount of regis-
trars. Table 4 lists the top 10 registrars that account for
81.8% SEO domains (out of 425,345 domains). Among
them, 21.0% domains were registered under Chengdu
West Dimension Digital Technology CO.. We
also found that a lot of SEO domains were owned by a
small number of registrants. As shown in Table 5, the top
10 registrants controlled 51.9% SEO domains (220,854
out of 425,345). Perhaps even more interesting is that a
lot of registrants in deed provide email addresses instead
of leaving them blank or using private registration to hide
their identities. It is recommended by spider pool com-
munity to acquire new and expiring domains, which has
been conﬁrmed by our data. Figure 7 illustrates the num-
ber of all SEO domains registered per month. The oldest
domain we observed was registered in Jan 2014 and the
domain age is about 2 years. Peaks of registration activ-
ities were observed during Oct 2015 and Feb 2016, and
it turns out the spider pool owners tend to register them
in bulk and use them for the same campaigns. Since the
domains are disposable, most of them are only registered
for only 1 or 2 years.
Structure dynamics. The previous results indicate that
spider pool owners usually recruit many new and expir-
ing domains to build up their infrastructures. However,
it is not yet clear about their strategies in maintaining
the infrastructure, especially on how the infrastructure
is evolved. To answer this question, we monitored the
structural changes of SSP for 25 days within Jan 2016.
We use the same spider pool explorer described in Sec-
tion 3 to crawl SSP every day and store the discovered
SEO domains separately. Figure 8 illustrates the daily

numbers of all SEO domains and the newly recruited
domains that were not seen before. The structure was
relatively stable for the ﬁrst two weeks, but it started to
change drastically in the third week: the amount of SEO
domains climbed up quickly to 1,800 and then dropped
back to 600. By inspecting the registration information,
it turns out a large number of domains would expire dur-
ing that week. So in order to compensate the loss, a bulk
of new domains was purchased to replenish the spider
pool. As the result, the size of the spider pool bounced
back to 1,600 on the 25th day.
5.2 Statistics of Spider Pool Campaigns
The above measurement study shows an overall view of
SEO domains recruited for spider pool usage.
In this
subsection, we studied the structure of individual spi-
der pools, including SEO domains and customer do-
mains/URLs. Among all conﬁrmed SEO domains, we
sample one domain per TLD/SLD as seed and run the
same crawling method described in Section 3.2 to dis-
cover the infrastructure of the whole spider pool. For
certain TLD/SLD containing much more SEO domains,
like .cn and .ac.cn, we sample several other domains.
Each newly discovered spider pool is compared with pre-
vious ones. If the overlap of SEO domains is over 50%,
the spider pool is likely to have been explored and is dis-
carded therefore. Through this process, we harvested 20
independent spider pools and the statistics are shown in
Table 6 (labeled as S1 to S20). The result of SSP is also
included. In total, we have discovered 15,816 SEO do-
