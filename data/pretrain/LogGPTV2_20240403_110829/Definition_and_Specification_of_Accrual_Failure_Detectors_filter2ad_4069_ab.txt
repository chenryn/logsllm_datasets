Failure detectors. Chandra and Toueg [6] deﬁne failure detectors as a collection of failure detector
modules, one attached to each process, that output information on the failure pattern that occurs in an
execution.5 A failure detector module outputs information from a range R of values. A failure detector
history H with range R is a function H : Π × T 7→ R, where H(p, t) is the value output by the failure
detector module of process p at time t. H is only deﬁned at times when the failure detector module
provides an answer to a query; the failure detector module may be queried whenever process p takes a
step, and each query eventually results in an answer. This follows the deﬁnition of oracles introduced
5The deﬁnition of failure detectors of Chandra and Toueg [7] restricts the output to a set of suspected processes. Accrual
failure detectors are based on the deﬁnition of Chandra et al. [6], that allows values taken from an arbitrary range.

Binary failure detectors, such as those deﬁned by Chandra and Toueg [7], output values from the
range R = 2Π, that is, the power set of Π. If a process is part of the output set, it is suspected to have
failed, otherwise it is trusted. An S-transition occurs when a trusted process becomes suspected and a
T-transition occurs when a suspected process becomes trusted.
Chandra and Toueg [7] deﬁne a class hierarchy of unreliable binary failure detectors, of which we
present only one, called ♦P (eventually perfect). The class is deﬁned by the set of failure detector
histories that it permits, as speciﬁed by the following two properties of completeness and accuracy.
(STRONG COMPLETENESS) Eventually every faulty process is permanently suspected by all correct
processes.
(EVENTUAL STRONG ACCURACY) There is a time after which correct processes are never suspected
by any correct process.
Quality of service metrics for failure detectors. Chen et al. [8] deﬁne metrics for the quality of
service of failure detectors. Quality of service quantiﬁes how fast a failure detector detects failures
(completeness) and how well it avoids wrong suspicions (accuracy). All metrics are deﬁned for a pair
of processes p and q, with q monitoring p. The metrics used in this paper are summarized below.
• The detection time (TD) is the time that elapses since p fails and until q starts suspecting p per-
manently (i.e., until the ﬁnal S-transition).
The detection time is the only completeness metric, deﬁned on runs in which p is faulty. In contrast,
all others metrics (below) relate to the accuracy and are deﬁned on runs in which p is correct.
• The mistake recurrence time (TMR) measures the time elapsed between two consecutive mistakes,
i.e., the time between two S-transitions.
• The mistake duration (TM ) measures the time it takes for the detector to correct a mistake, i.e.,
the time from an S-transition to the next T-transition.
• The average mistake rate (λM ) measures the rate at which a failure detector make mistakes, i.e.,
the average number of S-transitions per time unit.
• The query accuracy probability (PA) is the probability that the failure detector’s output is correct
at a random time.
• The good period duration (TG) measures the length of a good period, i.e., the time from a T-
transition to the next S-transition.
3 Deﬁnition of accrual failure detectors
In this section, we deﬁne what accrual failure detectors are. We begin by deﬁning the notion of suspicion
level between a pair of processes. Then, we deﬁne the notion of accrual failure detector for a distributed
system with n processes. Finally, we deﬁne a class of accrual failure detectors of particular interest,
called ♦P ac.
6Aguilera et al. [2] deﬁne oracles as a sequence of quadruples (p, t, i, o) where p is a process, t is a time instant, i is the
query of p at time t and o is the answer of the oracle at time t. Both i and o may take the value ⊥, meaning respectively that
no query is made at time t and that no answer is available at time t.

3.1 Suspicion level
Consider two distinct processes p and q, with q monitoring p. Let R+
0 denote the real positive numbers
and zero. The suspicion level of process q monitoring process p expresses the conﬁdence of q in the
statement that p is faulty.
Deﬁnition 1 (Suspicion level) The suspicion level of process q with respect to process p is the function
sl qp : T 7→ R+
0 . The function sl qp has a ﬁnite resolution, i.e., it may only assume integer multiples of
an (arbitrarily small, but non-inﬁnitesimal) positive constant , where for all t, sl qp(t)
 ∈ Z
Additionally, we consider that the suspicion level satisﬁes the following two properties.
Property 1 (Accruement) If process p is faulty, then eventually, the suspicion level sl qp(t) is monotonously
increasing at a positive rate.
