Hi,

I am currently building LibTorch for Windows using `build_windows.bat` and `build_libtorch.py`. The process has been running for over 12 hours without any verbose output in the console. 

Is there a log file that can help me troubleshoot the root cause of this issue?

Here are some relevant messages from the build process:
- Disabling CUDA because `NOT USE_CUDA` is set.
- CuDNN not found. Compiling without CuDNN support.
- Disabling ROCM because `NOT USE_ROCM` is set.
- MIOpen not found. Compiling without MIOpen support.
- Disabling MKLDNN because `USE_MKLDNN` is not set.
- Performing Test `C_HAS_THREAD` - Success.
- Not using NUMA.

Thank you for your assistance.
