User: There is a cloud server cluster that needs to achieve load balancing and high availability. Please provide a solution and explain the implementation steps.
Assistant: Solution description: Use HAProxy to achieve load balancing, and combine Keepalived to achieve high availability. As a front-end load balancer, HAProxy can distribute requests from clients to multiple back-end servers, and can dynamically adjust the distribution of request traffic according to policies such as load conditions and health status. Keepalived provides the high availability of the cluster through the virtual IP, which can realize the active/standby switch of the server and improve the reliability and stability of the system. Implementation steps: 1. Deploy HAProxy and Keepalived components to ensure that the software versions and configuration files of all nodes are consistent; 2. Configure HAProxy load balancing rules, such as distributing traffic based on URL paths, source IP addresses, cookies, etc.; 3. Configure HAProxy The health check mechanism checks the health status of the back-end server. If there is a failure, the traffic distribution will be automatically stopped; 4. Configure the VRRP protocol of Keepalived, and define parameters such as virtual IP address and priority; 5. Configure the status detection mechanism of Keepalived. When a node fails, the standby node will automatically take over the operation; 6. Test the load balancing and high availability scheme of the entire cluster, including sending HTTP requests to the virtual IP address of HAProxy, detecting the health status of the back-end server, and manually simulating the failure of the primary node wait. Points to note: 1. In the load balancing strategy of HAProxy, parameters such as weight and priority should be set to make traffic distribution more reasonable; 2. In the Keepalived state detection mechanism, appropriate parameters such as heartbeat interval and timeout should be set , to avoid misjudgment; 3. In the implementation process, abnormal situations should be considered, such as simultaneous failure of the primary node and standby node.
