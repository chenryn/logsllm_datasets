Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and detailed version of your text:

I am trying to integrate Python 3 into Vim, but I am having trouble getting it right during the compilation process. I am using Homebrew to install Vim with the following command:

```sh
brew install vim --override-system-vim --with-python3
```

Although Vim installs successfully, when I check the version, it still does not support Python 3.

**Solution:**

For the latest macOS version as of today, the following command worked for me:

```sh
brew install vim python3
```

I hope this solution works for you as well.

This version is more structured and clearly explains the problem and the solution.
