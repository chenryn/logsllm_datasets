## Abstract
Despite a series of attacks, the Mifare Classic remains the most widely deployed contactless smartcard. It uses a proprietary stream cipher, Crypto1, to provide confidentiality and mutual authentication between the card and reader. After reverse engineering, numerous vulnerabilities were identified, leading to various passive and active attacks. The most severe key recovery attacks require only wireless interaction with the card, making them particularly threatening as they can be performed in uncontrolled environments, evading detection. However, all previously proposed card-only attacks depend on implementation flaws that can be mitigated without breaking backward compatibility.

Consequently, many manufacturers and system integrators have started deploying "fixed" Mifare Classic cards that are resilient to these vulnerabilities. These countermeasures, however, are inadequate for a cryptographically insecure cipher like Crypto1. We present a novel ciphertext-only attack that exploits a crucial step in the authentication protocol, relying solely on the cryptographic weaknesses of Crypto1. This attack requires only a few minutes of wireless interaction with the card using consumer-grade hardware. The information obtained reduces the computational complexity from \(2^{48}\) to approximately \(2^{30}\), enabling us to recover a secret key from a hardened Mifare Classic card in about 5 minutes on a single-core consumer laptop.

## Introduction
Mifare Classic cards occupy a significant portion of the contactless smartcard market, offering modest memory and cryptographic capabilities suitable for applications such as access control and fare collection systems. Despite their widespread use, serious vulnerabilities have been identified after the reverse engineering of the proprietary Crypto1 cipher. These vulnerabilities have led to several practical attacks, including key recovery and cloning.

This paper proposes a new ciphertext-only attack that exploits the cryptographic weaknesses of Crypto1, requiring only wireless interaction with the card. We have fully implemented and tested this attack, recovering secret keys within minutes from various hardened Mifare Classic cards. Theoretical boundaries and performance analysis based on simulations are also provided.

## Related Work
### General Stream Cipher Attacks
Three main techniques have been introduced to attack LFSR-based stream ciphers:
1. **Guess-and-Determine Attack**: Effective if the cipher does not use its complete internal state to compute a keystream bit.
2. **Correlation Attack**: Exploits the relationship between internal state bits and the keystream.
3. **Algebraic Attacks**: Formulate the problem as a system of Boolean equations and solve it using techniques like Gaussian elimination.

### Attacks on Mifare Classic
- **Keystream Recovery Attack**: Recovers the keystream in a transaction between a reader and a card, exploiting a weak PRNG.
- **Genuine Reader Attacks**: Reverse-engineered the Crypto1 cipher, revealing weaknesses in the filter function and allowing key recovery from a single captured session.
- **Card-Only Attacks**: Require only interaction with the card, often exploiting weak random number generators or known error messages. Recent attacks, such as those by Chiu et al., do not rely on these but require a large amount of online generated traces, increasing the total running time.

## Background
### Mifare Classic Cards
Mifare Classic cards, designed in the 90s, implement a custom communication protocol, a proprietary cipher, and an authentication protocol. While the datasheet suggests compliance with standardized authentication protocols, the actual security properties are significantly weaker.

### Memory Structure
A Mifare Classic card's memory is divided into sectors, each containing blocks of sixteen bytes. The last block of each sector (the sector trailer) stores two secret keys and the access conditions for that sector.

## Vulnerabilities and Proposed Attack
### Vulnerabilities
- **Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)**: Allows keystream reuse and malleability attacks.
- **Filter Function Weaknesses**: Enables efficient key recovery from a single captured session.
- **Implementation Flaws**: Such as encrypted error code responses, which can be exploited in card-only attacks.

### Proposed Attack
Our novel ciphertext-only attack exploits a crucial step in the authentication protocol, relying solely on the cryptographic weaknesses of Crypto1. The attack requires only a few minutes of wireless interaction with the card and can be performed with consumer-grade hardware. The information obtained reduces the computational complexity, enabling practical key recovery.

## Performance Analysis
Theoretical boundaries and performance analysis based on simulations show that our attack can recover a secret key from a hardened Mifare Classic card in about 5 minutes on a single-core consumer laptop.

## Summary and Practical Implications
This paper presents a novel ciphertext-only attack on Mifare Classic cards, demonstrating the need for more secure cryptographic algorithms and authentication protocols. The attack highlights the inadequacy of current countermeasures and underscores the importance of upgrading to more secure alternatives.
