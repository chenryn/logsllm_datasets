ABSTRACT
Despite a series of attacks, mifare Classic is still the world’s
most widely deployed contactless smartcard on the market.
The Classic uses a proprietary stream cipher crypto1 to
provide conﬁdentiality and mutual authentication between
card and reader. However, once the cipher was reverse engi-
neered, many serious vulnerabilities surfaced. A number of
passive and active attacks were proposed that exploit these
vulnerabilities. The most severe key recovery attacks only
require wireless interaction with a card. System integrators
consider such card-only attacks as one of the most serious
threat vectors to their mifare Classic-based systems, since it
allows the adversary to avoid camera detection, which is of-
ten present at an access control entrance or public transport
gate. However, all card-only attacks proposed in the liter-
ature depend on implementation mistakes which can easily
be mitigated without breaking backwards compatibility with
the existing reader infrastructure.
Consequently, many manufactures and system integrators
started to deploy “ﬁxed” mifare Classic cards which are re-
silient to such vulnerabilities. However, these countermea-
sures are rather palliating and inadequate for a cryptograph-
ically insecure cipher such as crypto1. In support of this
proposition, we present a novel cipher-text card-only attack
that exploits a crucial and mandatory step in the authentica-
tion protocol and which solely depends on the cryptographic
weaknesses of the crypto1 cipher. Hence, in order to avoid
this attack, all cards and readers should be upgraded to sup-
port an alternative authentication protocol which inherently
breaks their backwards compatibility. Our attack requires
only a few minutes of wireless interaction with the card,
in an uncontrolled environment and can be performed with
consumer-grade hardware. The information obtained allows
an adversary to drop the computational complexity from
248 to approximately 230, which enabled us to practically
recover a secret key from a hardened mifare Classic card in
about 5 minutes on an single core consumer laptop.

Introduction
1
mifare Classic cards occupy a considerable part of the con-
tactless smartcard market. Such cards oﬀer, in addition to
simple identiﬁcation, a modest amount of memory and cryp-
tographic capability, making them suitable for applications
such as access control and fare collection systems.
The mifare Classic cards are still widely deployment in
many public transport payment systems. Examples of such
systems include the Oyster Card1 in London, the Char-
lie Card in Boston2, the EasyCard in Taiwan3, and the
OV-chipkaart in the Netherlands4.
In addition to public
transport, it is also still used for contactless access control
systems, integrated in many oﬃce buildings, including even
high-security facilities such as ministries, banks, prisons and
nuclear power stations.
mifare Classic cards are compatible with parts 1 to 3 of
the ISO/IEC 14443-A standard [ISO01], specifying physi-
cal characteristics, radio frequency interface and the anti-
collision protocol. However, part 4 of the standard, de-
scribing the transmission protocol, is not implemented. In-
stead, it uses its own secure communication layer. In this
layer, mifare Classic cards communicate encrypted by us-
ing a proprietary stream cipher, named crypto1, to provide
data conﬁdentiality and mutual authentication between card
and reader. The manufacturer, NXP Semiconductors, never
publicly released details of the cipher, nor the communica-
tion layer used in mifare Classic. However, both have been
successfully reverse engineered and their workings are pub-
lished in the literature [NESP08, GKGM+08].
Shortly after reverse engineering, serious vulnerabilities
were identiﬁed and several attacks surfaced that demon-
strated to be mountable in practice. For instance, the at-
tacks described in [GKGM+08] and [KGHG08] enable an
adversary to recover encryption keys used during commu-
nication and manipulate the related data segments on the
card. This allows the adversary to (partially) clone the card.
However, all the attacks mentioned above require the ad-
versary to have access to a legitimate reader, or eavesdrop

on genuine communication. Not long after, several attacks
were proposed [GRVS09, Cou09, CHC+14] which demon-
strate how to recover all encryption keys, and hence clone a
full card, only by wirelessly interacting with it. These card-
only attacks are the most eﬀective way for an adversary to
compromise the security of a mifare Classic based system.
Since a perpetrator can perform such an attack in an iso-
lated, non-controlled environment, they cause the maximal
amount of damage against the least possibility of detection.
Interestingly, all card-only attacks proposed in the liter-
ature rely on non-cryptographically related implementation
ﬂaws. Moreover, these implementation issues can be mit-
igated by issuing replacement cards where such ﬂaws are
removed, without even breaking backwards compatibility to
the original mifare Classic cards. However, these replace-
ment cards do not provide a solution to the actual problem,
which is the insecurity of the underlying cryptographic al-
gorithm and authentication protocol.

Classic compatible cards, together with revisions made to

Contribution In this paper we propose a ciphertext-only
attack against mifare Classic cards, which only requires
wireless interaction with the card for a few minutes with
consumer-grade hardware. We have fully implemented and
tested our attack in practice and recovered secret keys within
minutes from various hardened mifare Classic cards. In or-
der to give a better estimate of the average running-time,
theoretical boundaries and a performance analysis based on
simulations are given in this paper.
The attack proposed in this paper requires the adversary
to know at least one single key in advance. In practice, how-
ever, this typically the case. The ﬁrst key can be retrieved
by eavesdropping only one genuine authentication or two
failed authentication attempts, see [VKGG12, GKGV12,
GKGM+08] for more details. However, in many situations,
this is not necessary since most deployed systems leave de-
fault keys intact for unused sectors. Additionally, nearly all
deployed systems that use key diversiﬁcation leave at least
one sector key non-diversiﬁed, namely for storing the diversi-
ﬁcation information. Moreover, the manufacturer guidelines
for system integrators [MAD07] especially recommends this.
Overview This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
gives a broad overview of the literature related to attack
stream ciphers in general and the more closely related papers
that also attack the mifare Classic cryptosystem. Section 3
introduces the memory layout, cipher description and au-
thentication protocol that is used by a mifare Classic card.
Vulnerabilities to the mifare Classic cryptosystem are ad-
dressed in Section 4. Then, a novel method to attack the ci-
pher is proposed in Section 5, which is followed by Section 6
where we analyze the performance of the attack. Finally,
a summary of the attack and its practical implications are
given in Section 7.
2 Related work
In this section we ﬁrst explore similar general attack tech-
niques and then highlight the diﬀerent methods that were
proposed in the literature to attack a mifare Classic card.
For each previously proposed attack we analyze its signiﬁ-
cance and the corresponding practical implications.
2.1 General Stream Cipher attacks
In the last decades there are three main techniques intro-
duced to attack LFSR-based stream ciphers, such as the
one used in a mifare Classic card. First, the guess-and-
determine attack can be mounted if the cipher does not use
its complete internal state to compute a keystream bit, de-
spite several well-known historical recommendations in the
literature [Kuh88, And91, Gol96]. Besides the mifare Clas-
sic cryptosystem, many proprietary LFSR-based stream ci-
phers [Gol97, DHW+12, VGB12] lack this property and are
therefore vulnerable to partial and incremental internal state
guessing. Secondly, there is the correlation attack, which
was originally proposed by Siegenthaler [Sie84, Sie85] and
later improved by others [MS88, And95, CS91, CCCS92,
JJ00, CJM02].
It exploits the weakness of a relation be-
tween the internal state bits and the keystream. The ﬁl-
ter function of the mifare Classic cryptosystem uses some
input bits which are more inﬂuencing than others. This
allows for a similar correlation attack to be mounted. Fi-
nally, more recently, various algebraic attacks on general
stream ciphers were proposed [CP02, AK03, FJ03, CM03].
A property of a linear Boolean function is the possibility to
postpone an evaluation. Computational problems which are
formalized during a cryptographic attack can be written as
a system of Boolean equations [TT80]. Instead of comput-
ing the outcome directly, a combination of these equations
can be solved by well-known techniques such as Gaussian
elimination [Hil29, Mul56, Mar57, Str69]. Because of the
regularity of the chosen indexes of the ﬁlter function inputs,
the mifare Classic cryptosystem is particularly vulnerable
to these attacks.
2.2 Attacks on MIFARE Classic
Keystream recovery attack The ﬁrst practical attack
against mifare Classic was carried out in [KGHG08]. It re-
covers the used keystream in a transaction between a reader
and a card. Due to a weak pseudo-random number genera-
tor (PRNG), the resulting keystream can be kept constant
and reused by a malleability attack. For such an attack
knowledge about the secret key and encryption algorithm is
not required.
Genuine reader attacks The inner workings of crypto1
were reverse engineered shortly after the ﬁrst attack.
The Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is available
in [NESP08] and the non-linear ﬁlter function and authen-
tication protocol are shown in [GKGM+08]. The latter pro-
posed a serious attack that exploited weaknesses in the ﬁlter
function, allowing an adversary to invert the ﬁlter function
in an extremely eﬃcient way. This enables an adversary to
recover the secret key from a single captured authentication
session within a fraction of a second on ordinary hardware.
Card-only attacks A number of attacks that require only
interaction with a card were introduced by Garcia, van
Rossum, Verdult and Wichers Schreur in [GRVS09]. The
ﬁrst can be mounted against a single authentication and re-
quires precomputation tables. The knowledge of one sector
key allows for their second attack, which is mounted against
a nested authentication, it is extremely fast, and does not
require precomputation tables. The attack against a single
authentication was improved by Courtois [Cou09]. This at-
tack does not require any precomputation and is faster than
the one proposed by Garcia et al.
More recently, Chiu, Hong, Chou, Ding, Yang and
Cheng [CHC+14] proposed a card-only attack that does not
depend on a weak random number generator, instead it ex-
ploits another implementation mistake, the encrypted error
code response. Unfortunately, this attack requires a large
amount of online generated traces which signiﬁcantly in-
creases the total running time of their attack.
In fact, all card-only attacks that are proposed in the liter-
ature depend on either a weak random number generator, or
keystream leakage through known error messages, or both.
A straightforward solution against these attacks is to replace
the vulnerable cards with modiﬁed cards that do not contain
any known implementation mistake, but which are still fully
compatibility with the mifare Classic protocol. In this pa-
per we will refer to ﬁxed modiﬁed cards as hardened mifare
Classic cards, examples of such cards are given in Table 1.1.
3 Background
mifare Classic cards are one of the ﬁrst generation RFID
tags designed in the 90s. Since then, it has been a tradition
for the industry to design proprietary RFID products. Such
a proprietary design often contains custom deﬁned modula-
tion/encoding schemes, packets, checksums, instruction sets
and in some cases even custom made cryptographic algo-
rithms and authentication protocols.
There is not much wrong in designing a custom way of
RFID communication.
It allows the industry to optimize
products and boost the performance for speciﬁc applica-
tions. However, this argument certainly does not hold for
the proprietary and secret cryptosystems. Designing secure
algorithms is proven to be a diﬃcult task without feedback
from the scientiﬁc community [Ker83, JS97, SN97, Ver15].
3.1 MIFARE Classic cards
The mifare Classic card is an interesting example which im-
plements besides a custom communication protocol, a pro-
prietary cipher and also an authentication protocol. The
datasheet [PHI98] of the mifare Classic card suggests that
the security properties are compliant to standardized au-
thentication protocols [ISO99]. However, in practice the se-
curity properties are signiﬁcantly weaker than advertised.
3.2 Memory Structure
A mifare Classic card is es-
sentially a memory chip with
encrypted wireless capabili-
ties. The memory is divided
into sectors, each of which is
further divided into blocks of
sixteen bytes each. The last
block of each sector is the sec-
tor trailer and stores two se-
cret keys and the access conditions for that sector.
