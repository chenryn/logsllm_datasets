On testing #2994
In this snippet range select both 'foo' and 'bar' methods and then perform
'Fold' operation.
    class xyz {
        foo() {
            hello
        }
        bar() {
            world
        }
    }
Observe: only 'foo' is collapsed.  
I would expect that all regions overlapping with the text selection are
collapsed.
