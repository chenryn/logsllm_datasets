history background
Wardriving got popular in the early
2000’s as a way for people to find
open networks to piggyback on [1].
Equipment was pretty expensive
and limited.
2000
The number of devices that are connected over wireless
has increased exponentially since the early 2000’s and
make Wardriving, Netstumbling and Wireless Monitoring
more exciting than ever.
2015
Warwalking with a single-board computer in my 
backpack for Defcon 23. Collected data on 2 
channels at a time.
Backpack Test Project
2016
Planted 12 monitoring boxes around the 
conference for Defcon 24. 48 total wireless 
radios scanning at the same time.
Project Lana
2017+ 25 Hak5 Pineapple Tetras that cover 50 total 
channels in 2.4 and 5 GHz. Over 3 hours of 
battery life. Weighs ~35 lbs.

but why though? 
Understand the FUD
Nearly every person has heard that DEFCON’s network is the most 
dangerous in the world. I wanted to know why and how it is so dangerous. 
Understanding is the first step to protecting yourself. 
The Connected World
Everything is connected now and usually with more than 1 radio. This 
makes for amazing data. Whether it’s your phone’s mobile hotspot to the 
‘SMART’ THINGS (IoT) need to be connected and we gotta catch them all!
Verify Then Trust
Do you trust that security, software and API’s are being done correctly 
when communicating over a network? Do you know if your favorite app 
uses encryption? By scanning yourself you can verify how secure things 
are.

how’d you do analysis?
sometimes you have a tool and sometimes you build a tool
Traditional Network Tools
Wireshark and Networkminer were instrumental in providing summery 
information from the PCAP data. Great for spot checking the data.
Kismet WebUI and KismetDB
Awesome for real-time analytics about what is happening. Additionally 
helpful to reload KismetDB files after the fact to relive the fun. KismetDB’s 
are SQLITE DBs which enables easy querying. 
PCAPinator
Built a custom Python 3 tool that leverages Wireshark’s command line 
tools like tshark by using parallel processing on very large PCAP file 
datasets. Has a lot of custom output types like CSV, HCCX, etc.

data leaks
sharing is caring!
App API’s using HTTP
Found in the DEFCON 25 dataset this API leaks location information 
potentially from a weather app showing sunrise info on a mobile device. 
The app could have trusted access to location data and shares it with 
anyone listening. 
Host: www.met.no
API Call: 
http://api.met.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.1/?lat=36.1164&lon=-
115.1785&date=2018-08-11
Lat/Lon: 36.1164,-115.1785
API still accepts HTTP requests today but was updated a little:

what i’ve learned
DEFCON is truly a global community
DEAUTH’s will happen
PINEAPPLES are a thing
API’s will leak

countermeasures protection
knowing is half the battle!
Do not enable auto-connect when connecting to an 
open Wireless Network! Delete networks from your 
devices that you are not going to continue to connect 
to!
DO NOT AUTO-CONNECT
countermeasures protection
VPN services are cheaper and easier to use now than 
ever. You can get one that has an app on your device 
that will enable you to easily enable it when you are on 
an untrusted network. 
USE A VPN
Using data over cell networks should reduce your risk 
and coupling it with a VPN on top will make it even 
better.
USE 4G*/5G INSTEAD
*New research about 4G vulnerabilities is due to be 
released stay tuned for updates and panic.
