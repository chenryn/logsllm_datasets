given role, the user must be authorized for it. Some roles 
may  be  assumed  by  only  one  user  at  a  time  {e.g., 
distributor).  With  each  role  comes  the  ability  to  perform 
certain operations. 
Object:  a single-level unit of information. An object is 
the  smallest  unit  of  information  in  the  system  that  has  a 
classification. An object thus contains no other objects; it 
is  not  multilevel.  There  are  many  kinds  of  objects;  an 
example is the date-time-group of a message. 
Container:    A  multilevel  information  structure.  A 
container  has  a  classification  and  may  contain  objects 
(each  with its own classification) and/or other containers. 
In  most  MMS  family  members,  message  files  and 
messages  are  containers.  Some  fields  of  a  message  (such 
5  This  definition  corresponds  to  that  used  by  other 
authors for security level. In this paper, security level and 
classification are synonyms. 
as  the  Text  field)  may  be  containers  as  well.  The 
distinction between an object and a container is based on 
type,  not  current  contents:  within  a  family  member,  if  an 
entity of type message file is a container, then all message 
files in that family member are containers, even if some of 
them  are  empty  or  contain  only  objects and/or containers 
classified  at  the  same  level  as  the  message  file  itself. 
Devices  such  as  disks,  printers,  tape  drives,  network 
interfaces,  and  users'  terminals  will  be  containers,  rather 
than objects, in most MMS members. 
Entity:  either a container or an object. 
Container Clearance Required (CCR):  an attribute of 
some  containers.  For  some  containers,  it  is  important  to 
require  a  minimum  clearance,  so  that  if  a  user  does  not 
have  at  least  this  clearance,  he  cannot  view  any  of  the 
entities  within  the  container.  Such  containers  are  marked 
with  the  attribute  Container  Clearance  Required  (CCR). 
For  example,  a  user  with  only  a  CONFIDENTIAL 
clearance  could  be  prohibited  from  viewing  just  the 
CONFIDENTIAL  paragraphs  of  a  message  classified 
TOP  SECRET  by  marking  the  message  (which  is  a 
container)  "CCR."  On  the  other  hand,  given  a  message 
file containing both TOP SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL 
messages,  it  may  be  acceptable  to  allow  the  user  in 
question to view the CONFIDENTIAL ones, even though 
the  container  (message  file)  as  a  whole  is  classified  TOP 
SECRET.  In  this  case,  the  file  would  not  be  marked 
"CCR." 
ID:  identifier. An ID names an entity without referring 
to other entities. For example, the name of a message file 
is an ID for that file. Some, but not necessarily all, entities 
can  be  named  by  identifiers.  Entities  may  also  be  named 
by indirect references (see below). 
Direct reference: a reference to an entity is direct if it 
is the entity's ID. 
Indirect  reference:    a  reference  to  an  entity  is  indirect 
if it is a sequence of two or more entity names (of which 
only  the  first  may  be  an  ID).  An  example  is  "the  current 
message's Text field's third paragraph." 
Operation:  a function that can be applied to an entity. 
It may simply allow that entity to be viewed (e.g., display 
a  message),  or  it  may  modify  the  entity  (update  a 
message),  or  both  (create  a  message).  Some  operations 
may  involve  more  than  one  entity  (copy  a  message  from 
one message file to another). 
Access Set:  a set of triples (userID or role, operation, 
operand  index)  that  is  associated  with  an  entity.  The 
operations  that  may  be  specified  for  a  particular  entity 
depend  on  the  type  of  that  entity.  If  a  given  operation 
requires  more  than  one  operand,  the  operand  index 
specifies  the  position  in  which  a  reference  to  this  entity 
may  appear  as  an  operand.  For  messages,  operations 
include  DISPLAY,  UPDATE,  DELETE,  and  so  on.  The 
existence  of  a  particular  triple  in  the  access  set  implies 
that the user corresponding to the specified userID or role

is  authorized  to  invoke  the  specified  operation  on  the 
entity with which the set is associated. 
Message:    a  particular  type  implemented  by  an  MMS. 
In  most  MMS  family  members,  a  message  will  be  a 
container,  though  messages  may  be  objects  in  some 
receive-only  systems.  A  message  will  include  To,  From, 
Date-Time-Group, Subject, Releaser, and Text fields, and 
additional  fields  as  well.  A  draft  message  also  includes  a 
Drafter field. 
4.2  User's View of MMS Operation 
We  present  the  following  as  a  model  of  the  use  of  a 
secure  MMS.  Terms  defined  above  are  printed  in 
uppercase. 
the  USER 
authentication, 
People  can  gain  access  to  the  system  only  by  logging 
in. To log in, a person presents a USERID and the system 
performs  authentication,  using  passwords,  fingerprint 
recognition,  or  any  appropriate  technique.  Following  a 
successful 
invokes 
OPERATIONS  to  perform  the  functions  of  the  message 
system.  The  OPERATIONS  a  USER  may invoke depend 
on  his  USERID  and  the  ROLES  for  which  he  is 
authorized;  by  applying  OPERATIONS,  the  USER  may 
view or modify OBJECTS or CONTAINERS. The system 
enforces  the  security  assertions  listed  below  (that  is,  it 
prevents  the  user  from  performing  OPERATIONS  that 
would contradict these assertions). 
4.3 
Security Assumptions 
It  will  always  be  possible  for  a  valid  user  to 
compromise  information  to  which  he  has  legitimate 
access.  To  make  the  dependence  of  system  security  on 
user  behavior  explicit,  we  list  the  following  assumptions. 
These  assumptions  are  really  security  assertions  that  can 
only be enforced by the users of the system. 
A1.  The  System  Security  Officer 
(SSO)  assigns 
clearances,  device  classifications,  and  role  sets 
properly. 
A2.    The  user  enters  the  correct  classification  when 
composing, editing, or re-classifying information. 
A3.  Within  a  classification,  the  user  addresses  messages 
and  defines  access  sets  for  entities  he  creates  so  that 
only  users  with  a  valid  need-to-know  can  view  the 
information. 
A4.    The  user  properly  controls  information  extracted 
from  containers  marked  CCR  {i.e.,  exercises 
discretion  in  moving  that  information  to  entities  that 
may not be marked CCR). 
The  basis  for  these  assumptions  is  that  when  there  is 
no  other  source  of  information  about  the classification of 
an entity or the clearance of a person, the user is assumed 
to provide information that is correct. 
4.4 
Security Assertions  
The  following  statements  hold  for  a  multilevel  secure 
MMS: 
Authorization   
1.  A  user  can  invoke  an operation on an entity only if 
the  user's  userID  or  current  role  appears  in  the  entity's 
access  set  along  with  that  operation  and  with  an  index 
value  corresponding  to  the  operand  position in which the 
entity is referred to in the requested operation.  
Classification hierarchy   
2. The classification of any container is always at least 
as  high  as  the  maximum  of  the  classifications  of  the 
entities it contains.  
Changes to objects   
3.  Information  removed  from  an  object  inherits  the 
classification  of  that  object.  Information  inserted  into  an 
object  must  not  have  a  classification  higher  than  the 
classification of that object.  
Viewing 
4.  A  user  can  view  (on  some  output  medium)  only  an 
entity with a classification less than or equal to the user's 
clearance  and  the  classification  of  the  output  medium. 
(This  assertion  applies  to  entities  referred  to  either 
directly or indirectly).  
Access to CCR entities   
5.  A  user  can  have  access  to  an  indirectly  referenced 
entity  within  a  container  marked  "Container  Clearance 
Required"  only  if  the  user's  clearance  is  greater  than  or 
equal to the classification of that container.  
Translating indirect references   
6.  A  user  can  obtain  the  ID  for  an  entity  that  he  has 
referred to indirectly only if he is authorized to view that 
entity via that reference. 
Labeling requirement   
7. Any entity viewed by a user must be labeled with its 
classification 
Setting clearances, role sets, device levels   
8. Only a user with the role of System Security Officer 
can  set  the  clearance  and  role  set  recorded  for  a  user  or 
the  classification  assigned  to  a  device.  A  user's  current 
role set can be altered only by that user or by a user with 
the role of System Security Officer. 
Downgrading   
9.  No  classification  marking  can  be  downgraded 
except  by  a  user  with  the  role  of  downgrader  who  has 
invoked a downgrade operation. 
Releasing 
10. No draft message can be released except by a user 
with  the  role  of releaser. The userID of the releaser must 
be recorded in the "releaser" field of the draft message.

4.5  Discussion 
The  purpose  of  this  subsection  is  to  clarify  the  effects 
of the model in particular cases. The paragraphs below are 
not part of the model; the previous subsections define the 
model  completely.  Here  we  seek  only  to  show  how  the 
model applies in specific circumstances. 
(1)  What  prevents  a  user  from  copying  a  classified 
entity to an unclassified entity? 
The  classification  of 
the  entity  being  copied 
accompanies the data. Moving explicitly classified data to 
an  unclassified  container  is  a  violation  of  assertion  2 
(classification hierarchy) and 9 (downgrading), unless the 
user  requesting  the  operation  is  the  downgrader  and  is 
performing 
the 
classification  of  the  data  in  question  is  effectively 
changed  by  the  operation.  Manipulations  that  affect  only 
objects are covered by assertion 3 (changes to objects). 
downgrade 
a 
operation, 
since 
(2) What about copying a part of an object into another 
object? 
A  part  of  an  object  inherits  the  classification  of  the 
whole  object  (assertion  3,  changes  to  objects).  Thus 
moving part of an object into another object is disallowed 
by  assertions  2  (classification  hierarchy)  and  3  unless 
classification of the former object is less than or equal to 
that  of  the  latter.  Note  that  this  constraint does not affect 
the  user's  ability 
remove  an  UNCLASSIFIED 
paragraph (an object) from a CONFIDENTIAL document 
(a container) and use it in an UNCLASSIFIED document 
(another container). 
to 
(3) Does a user have a "login level"? 
Login  levels  are  not  explicitly  part  of  the  model,  but 
the  effect  of  a  login  level  can  be  obtained  through  the 
classification  of  the  user's  terminal.  The  classification  of 
the  terminal  is  an  upper  bound  on  the  classification  of 
information  that  can  be  displayed  on  it  (assertion  4, 
viewing). If the user wishes to restrict further the level of 
the  information  that  appears  on  the  terminal,  he  may 
invoke  an  operation  to  reduce  the  classification  of  the 
terminal.  The  right  to  determine  the  classification  of 
shared devices (disks, printers, etc.) will generally belong 
to  the  SSO.  Note  that  restricting  the  level  of  the 
information  that  can  appear  on  the  user's  terminal  does 
not  necessarily  restrict  the  level  of  information  that 
programs he invokes may have access to. 
(4)  Processes  do  not  appear  in  the  model  but  surely 
will  be  present  in  the  implementation.  How  will  their 
activities be constrained? 
Operations,  rather  than  processes  or  programs,  are  in 
the  model  because  they  correspond  more  closely  to  the 
user's  view  of  the  system.  To  the  user,  the  system  offers 
functions  that  may  be  invoked  by  typing  strings  of 
characters,  pushing  function  keys,  etc.  Each  function  can 
be  understood  by  the  user  as  an  operation.  In  the 
implementation,  processes  are  constrained  to  invoke only 
operations that preserve the truth of the assertions. 
(5)  Which  entities  in  a  particular  message  system  will 
be containers and which will be objects? 
This decision is part of the next more detailed level of 
the  stated  model.  Some  likely  choices  are  that  messages 
and message files will be containers and that the date-time 
group  will  be  an  object.  It  is  not  necessary  that  all
