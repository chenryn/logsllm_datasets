User: How to configure the Nginx server to deal with high traffic and high concurrent access?
Assistant: Here are some recommended configurations and best practices for high-traffic and high-concurrency Nginx servers: 1. Use the latest stable version of Nginx, and make sure that necessary modules such as gzip and ssl are installed. 2. Configure load balancing to distribute traffic to multiple backend servers to avoid single point of failure and failover. 3. Adjust Nginx performance parameters, such as worker_processes, worker_connections and keepalive_timeout, to handle more concurrent connections and requests. 4. Configure caching and compression to reduce server response time and reduce network bandwidth usage. 5. Configure security measures such as firewall and DDoS defense. 6. Through the use of CDN and content distribution network, the content of the website is distributed to multiple locations around the world to improve access speed and availability. 7. Use monitoring and log analysis tools to monitor and analyze server performance and user behavior in real time to find and solve problems.
