### Additional Information
Our app is a book reading app. We updated the version of electron from 5.10 to
11.2.3 last month.  
We have got a lot of complaints about "can not add new books to the library
sometimes." after the update.  
Our team member has encountered the same problem once, but we cannot reproduce
it afterwards.  
Right now, we have narrowed down the problem to following functions
fse.copy().
