User: I wrote a python script that depends on a certain NFS share to be available. If the NFS share is not mounted it will happily copy the files to the local path where it should be mounted, but fail later when it tries to copy some files back that were created on the NFS server. 
I'd like to catch this error specifically so I can print a useful error message that will tell the users of this script what they have to do.
My first idea would be to execute mount using subprocess and then check the output for this nfs share. But I'm wondering if there isn't a nicer and more robust method of doing it.
Assistant: you cat parse /proc/mount file. Notice, that on different platforms and kernel versions file format may be different.
