### Data Collection and Analysis

**Time Frame and Initial Data:**
Data collection for this study spanned from October 14, 2009, to December 31, 2013. The primary data collection began on November 28, 2011. However, China Group 3 and Tibet Group 1 provided us with their pre-existing archives of suspicious emails, which extended the dataset back to October 14, 2009. In total, we received 817 emails from the 10 groups participating in our study.

**Group Submissions:**
Table 2 details the submissions from each group, highlighting the non-uniform distribution of email samples across the groups. For our analysis, we focus primarily on groups that submitted at least 50 emails.

**Cumulative Submissions:**
Figure 1 illustrates the cumulative number of email submissions per month over the course of the study. For instance, China Group 3 shared a set of emails received in 2010 by a highly targeted member of the organization, as shown in Figure 1. Tibet Group 1 contributed the highest number of submissions, likely due to being one of the first groups in the study and being persistently targeted by politically motivated malware. Tibetan Groups 2 and 4, who joined the study later (in April 2012), show a similar submission rate, suggesting they are targeted at a similar frequency.

### Participating Groups

**Summary of Groups:**
Table 1 provides a summary of the groups participating in our study, including their organizational focus and size.

| Organization Code | Description | Organization Size |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| China Group 1     | Human rights organization focused on rights and social justice issues related to China | Small (1-20 employees) |
| China Group 2     | Independent news organization reporting on China | Small (1-20 employees) |
| China Group 3     | Human rights organization focused on rights and social justice issues related to China | Small (1-20 employees) |
| Rights Group 1    | Human rights organization focused on multiple issues and countries | Large (over 100 employees) |
| Rights Group 2    | Human rights organization focused on multiple issues and countries | Large (over 100 employees) |
| Tibet Group 1     | Human rights organization focused on Tibet | Small (1-20 employees) |
| Tibet Group 2     | Human rights organization focused on Tibet | Small (1-20 employees) |
| Tibet Group 3     | Independent news organization reporting on Tibet | Small (1-20 employees) |
| Tibet Group 4     | Human rights organization focused on Tibet | Small (1-20 employees) |
| Tibet Group 5     | Human rights organization focused on Tibet | Small (1-20 employees) |

### Email Classification and Analysis

**Malicious Email Types:**
We classify emails as malicious if they include attached malware, a direct link to malware or a site with a drive-by download, or a link to a phishing page. Figure 2 breaks down the types of malicious emails for groups that submitted at least 25 emails. The most common approach was attaching a malicious payload to the email itself. However, we observed a higher rate of phishing attacks on China-related groups and rights groups working on multiple international human rights issues. Specifically, 46% of the emails submitted by China Group 1 and 50% of the emails submitted by Rights Group 1 directed users to a phishing website. For China Group 1, this high proportion is due to their spam filter configuration, which forwarded a large number of generic, non-targeted spam. In contrast, the phishing attempts for Rights Group 1, while low in volume (13 out of 26 messages), were targeted.

**Manual Analysis of Malware:**
Given the rate of submissions, it was feasible to manually analyze email attachments for malware. This manual analysis provided higher confidence in our results, as automated antivirus signatures often fail to detect new or modified threats. In total, we analyzed 3,617 payload files and found 2,814 (78%) to be malicious. Section 4.3 describes our analysis methodology in more detail.

### Targeted Threat Index (TTI)

**Introduction:**
Our dataset includes a wide range of targeted malware threats varying in both social engineering and technical complexity. To address the lack of a standardized system for ranking the sophistication of targeted email attacks, we developed the Targeted Threat Index (TTI). The TTI score is intended to prioritize the analysis of incoming threats and provide an overall idea of the severity of the threat to an organization.

**TTI Calculation:**
The TTI score is calculated using the following formula:
\[ \text{Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value} \times \text{Technical Sophistication Multiplier} = \text{TTI Score} \]

**Scoring Range:**
TTI scores range from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most sophisticated attack. A score of 0 is reserved for threats that are not targeted, even if they are malicious.

**Social Engineering Tactics:**
We use a manual coding approach to measure the sophistication of social engineering tactics. This manual analysis allows us to have high confidence in our results, especially since understanding the social engineering often requires contextual information provided by the organizations. We code the emails based on their subject line, body, attachments, and header fields into 8 themes: Country/Region, Ethnic Groups, Event, Organizations, People, Political, Technology, and Miscellaneous.

**Content Coding and Analysis:**
Table 3 summarizes the themes and provides examples of categories within each theme. Our analysis confirms that social engineering is a critical tool for adversaries delivering targeted malware. For example, 95% and 97% of emails to Chinese and Tibetan groups, respectively, included references to relevant regional issues. Spoofing of specific senders and organizations was also prevalent, with 52% of emails to Tibetan groups designed to appear to come from real organizations, often within the Tibetan community.

**Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value:**
To assign the "social engineering sophistication base value," we consider the content and presentation of the email message, as well as the claimed sender identity. The criteria for assigning the base value are as follows:

- **0 Not Targeted:** Recipient does not appear to be a specific target. Content is not relevant to the recipient.
- **1 Targeted Not Customized:** Recipient is a specific target, but the content is not relevant or contains obviously false information.
- **2 Targeted Poorly Customized:** Recipient is a specific target, but the content has questionable attributes (e.g., poor spelling, incorrect addressing).
- **3 Targeted Customized:** Recipient is a specific target, and the content is relevant and can be externally verified.
- **4 Targeted Personalized:** Recipient is a specific target, and the email is personalized (e.g., specifically addressed or referring to the individual or organization by name).
- **5 Targeted Highly Personalized:** Recipient is a specific target, and the email is individually personalized and references confidential/sensitive information directly relevant to the target.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the social engineering tactics used in targeted email attacks.
