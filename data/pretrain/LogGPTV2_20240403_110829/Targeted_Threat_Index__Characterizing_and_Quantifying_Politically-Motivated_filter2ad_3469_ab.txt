from October 14, 2009 to December 31, 2013. Data col-
lection began on November 28, 2011, but China Group
3 and Tibet Group 1 forwarded us their pre-existing
archives of suspicious emails, resulting in e-mail sam-
ples dating back to October 14, 2009. In total, we re-
ceived 817 e-mails from the 10 groups participating in
our study. Table 2 breaks down the submissions from
each groups and illustrates that submissions were highly
non-uniform across the groups. Thus, in general, we fo-
cus on the groups with at least 50 e-mail submissions for
our analysis.
Figure 1 shows the cumulative number of e-mail sub-
missions per month over the course of the study. For
example, China Group 3 shared a set of e-mails received
in 2010 by a highly targeted member of the organization,
which can be observed in Figure 1. Tibet Group 1 ac-
counts for the highest number of submissions relative to
the other groups due to being one of the ﬁrst groups in
the study and being persistently targeted by politically
motivated malware. Tibetan Groups 2 and 4, who joined
the study later (in April 2012) show a similar submission
rate to original Tibetan Group 1, suggesting these groups
are targeted at a similar rate. In Section 4.2, we investi-

gate commonalities in targeting of these groups.
We further classify e-mails as malicious if they include
attached malware, a direct link to malware or a site with
a drive-by download, or a link to a phishing page. Fig-
ure 2 shows the amount of e-mails of each type for the
groups that submitted at least 25 e-mails to our system.
The most common approach employed in these e-mails
was attaching a malicious payload to the e-mail itself.
However, we notice a higher rate of phishing attacks on
the China-related groups and the rights groups working
on multiple international human rights issues. In partic-
ular, 46% of the e-mails submitted by China Group 1,
and 50% of the e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1, di-
rect the user to a phishing Web site. In the case of China
Group 1, this large proportion of phishing sites is ob-
served because this group conﬁgured their spam ﬁlter to
forward e-mails to our system, resulting in us receiving
a large number of generic, non-targeted spam. In con-
trast, the phishing observed for Rights Group 1, while
low in volume (13 out of 26 messages) is targeted. We
delve more into how we rate the targeting of e-mails in
Section 4.2.
The rate of submissions to our project meant that it
was feasible to manually analyze e-mail attachments for
malware as they were submitted. This analysis gives us
higher conﬁdence in our results because AV signatures
are frequently unable to detect new or modiﬁed threats,
and can overlook the presence of a malicious payload
that can be easily identiﬁed upon manual inspection (e.g.
shellcode in an RTF exploit). In total, we analyzed 3,617
payload ﬁles and found 2,814 (78%) of them to be ma-
licious. Section 4.3 describes our analysis methodology
in more detail.
4 Targeted Threat Index
Our dataset includes a wide range of targeted malware
threats varying in level of both social engineering and
technical complexity. This range presents a challenge
in ranking the relative sophistication of the malware and
targeting tactics used by attackers.
While scoring systems such as the Common Vulnera-
bility Scoring System [17] exist for the purpose of com-
municating the level of severity and danger of a vul-
nerability, there is no standardized system for ranking

the sophistication of targeted email attacks. This gap is
likely because evaluating the sophistication of the target-
ing is non-technical, and cannot be automated due to the
requirement of a strong familiarity with the underlying
subject material.
To address this gap we developed the Targeted Threat
Index (TTI) to assign a ranking score to the targeted ma-
licious emails in our dataset. The TTI score is intended
for use in prioritizing the analysis of incoming threats,
as well as for getting an overall idea of how severely an
organization is threatened.
The TTI score is calculated by taking a base value de-
termined by the sophistication of the targeting method,
which is then multiplied by a value for the technical
sophistication of the malware. The base score can be
used independently to compare emails, and the combined
score gives an indication of the level of effort an attacker
has put into individual threats.
4.1 TTI Metric
The TTI score is calculated in two parts:
(Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value)
×(Technical Sophistication Multiplier) =TTI Score
TTI scores range from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most
sophisticated attack. Scores of 0 are reserved for threats
that are not targeted, even if they are malicious. For
example, spam using an attached PDF or XLS to by-
pass anti-spam ﬁlters, and highly sophisticated ﬁnan-
cially motivated malware, would both score 0.
This section overviews how we compute the Social
Engineering Sophistication Base Value (Section 4.2) and
the Technical Sophistication Multiplier (Section 4.3). In
Section 4.4, we present the results of computing and an-
alyzing the TTI value of threats observed by the organi-
zations in our study. We also discuss implications and
limitations of the metric.
4.2 Social Engineering Tactics
We leverage a manual coding approach to measure the
sophistication of social engineering tactics used in the at-
tacks observed by the organizations in our study. While
automated approaches may be explored in the future, this
manual analysis allows us to have high conﬁdence in our
results, especially since understanding the social engi-
neering often required contextual information provided
by the organizations in our study. To quantify the level
of sophistication, we manually analyse the e-mail subject
line, body, attachments and header ﬁelds. We perform an
initial content analysis by coding the e-mails based on
their semantic content, and then use these results to gen-
erate a numerical metric quantifying the level of targeting
used.
4.2.1 Content coding and analysis results
We code the e-mails based on their subject line, body, at-
tachments and headers using the following methodology:
Subject line, body, and attachments. The content of
the subject line, body and attachments for each submitted
e-mail were content coded into 8 themes, each contain-
ing categories for speciﬁc instances of the theme: Coun-
try / Region (referring to a speciﬁc geographical country
or region); Ethnic Groups (referring to a speciﬁc ethnic
group); Event (referring to a speciﬁc event); Organiza-
tions (referring to speciﬁc organizations); People (refer-
ring to speciﬁc persons), Political (reference to speciﬁc
political issues), Technology (reference to technical sup-
port), Miscellaneous (content without clear context or
categories that do not fall into one of the other themes).
Table 3 summarizes the themes and provides examples
of categories within each theme.
E-mail headers.
The header of each e-mail was an-
alyzed to determine if the sending e-mail address was
spoofed or the e-mail address was otherwise designed
to appear to come from a real person and / or organiza-
tion (e.g. by registering an e-mail account that resembles
a person and / or organization’s name from a free mail
provider). We divide the results based on whether they
attempted to spoof an organization or a speciﬁc person.
Using this manual analysis, we perform a content anal-
ysis of e-mails submitted by the organizations. Results
of this analysis conﬁrm that social engineering is an im-
portant tool in the arsenal of adversaries who aim to de-
liver targeted malware. Speciﬁcally, 95% and 97% of
e-mails to Chinese and Tibetan groups, respectively, in-
cluded reference to relevant regional issues. Spooﬁng
of speciﬁc senders and organizations was also prevalent
with 52% of e-mails to Tibetan groups designed to ap-
pear to come from real organizations, often from within
the Tibetan community. For example, a common tar-
get of spooﬁng was the Central Tibetan Administration
(CTA), referenced in 21% of the spoofed e-mails, which
administers programs for Tibetan refugees living in In-
dia and advocates for human rights in Tibet. While the
number of e-mail submissions were lower for the gen-
eral human rights groups, we observe similar trends there
with 92% of e-mails submitted by Rights Group 1 ap-
pearing to come from individuals in the group (as a result
of spooﬁng).
In some cases we even observed the same attackers
targeting multiple CSOs with customized e-mail lures.
For example, we tracked a campaign that targeted China
Groups 1 and 2, and Tibet Group 1 with a remote access

trojan we call IEXPL0RE [22] China Group 1 received
the malware in e-mails claiming to be from personal
friends whereas China Group 2 received the malware in
an e-mail containing a story about a high-rise apartment
building ﬁre in China.
In contrast, Tibet Group 1 re-
ceived the malware embedded into a video of a speech
by the Dalai Lama, attached to an e-mail about a year in
review of Tibetan human rights issues.
4.2.2 Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value
While the content analysis results clearly show attacks
tailored to the interests of targeted groups, content cod-
ing alone does not give a relative score of the sophistica-
tion used in the attacks. We now describe how we assign
the “social engineering sophistication base value” to e-
mails based on their level of social engineering.
To measure the targeting sophistication we assign a
score that ranges from 0-5 that rates the social engineer-
ing techniques used to get the victim to open the attach-
ment. This score considers the content and presentation
of the e-mail message as well as the claimed sender iden-
tity. This determination also includes the content of any
associated ﬁles, as malware is often implanted into legit-
imate relevant documents to evade suspicion from users
when the malicious documents are opened.
The Social Engineering Sophistication Base Value is
assigned based on the following criteria:
0 Not Targeted: Recipient does not appear to be a spe-
ciﬁc target. Content is not relevant to the recipient. The
e-mail is likely spam or a non-targeted phishing attempt.
1 Targeted Not Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc
target. Content is not relevant to the recipient or contains
information that is obviously false with little to no valida-
tion required by the recipient. The e-mail header and/or
signature do not reference a real person or organization.
2 Targeted Poorly Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc
target. Content is generally relevant to the target but has
attributes that make it appear questionable (e.g. incom-
plete text, poor spelling and grammar, incorrect address-
ing). The e-mail header and / or signature may reference
a real person or organization.
3 Targeted Customized: Recipient is a speciﬁc target.
Content is relevant to the target and may repurpose legit-
imate information (such as a news article, press release,
conference or event website) and can be externally ver-
iﬁed (e.g. message references information that can be
found on a website). Or, the e-mail text appears to re-
purpose legitimate e-mail messages that may have been
collected from public mailing lists or from compromised
accounts. The e-mail header and / or signature references
a real person or organization.
4 Targeted Personalized: Recipient is a speciﬁc target.
The e-mail message is personalized for the recipient or
target organization (e.g. speciﬁcally addressed or refer-
ring to individual and / or organization by name). Con-
tent is relevant to the target and may repurpose legitimate
information that can be externally veriﬁed or appears to
repurpose legitimate messages. The e-mail header and /
or signature references a real person or organization.
5 Targeted Highly Personalized: Recipient is a spe-
ciﬁc target. The e-mail message is individually person-
alized and customized for the recipient and references
conﬁdential / sensitive information that is directly rele-
vant to the target (e.g.
internal meeting minutes, com-
promised communications from the organization). The
e-mail header and / or signature references a real person
