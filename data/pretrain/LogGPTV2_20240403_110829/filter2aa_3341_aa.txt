# Off-Grid Communications with Android m0nk and stoker: Fun at DefCon 20 - Meshing the Mobile World

## Who Are We?
- **m0nk (Josh Thomas)**
  - Email: [PI:EMAIL]
- **Stoker (Jeff Robble)**
  - Email: [PI:EMAIL]
- We work at The MITRE Corporation, known for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.

## Data in Crisis Situations
In disaster scenarios, data often becomes inaccessible or lost. Examples include:
- Fukushima
- Hurricane Katrina
- Typhoon Haiyan
- Other similar events

## Why Mesh Networks Matter
- **Resilience:** Physical infrastructure is prone to failure, but mesh networks can remain operational.
- **Bypass Cellular and Wi-Fi:** Mesh networks can bypass traditional cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
- **Information Sharing:** They allow for sharing information when infrastructure is broken or untrustworthy.
- **Network Extension:** Mesh networks can extend and bridge other networks via tethering.
- **Headless Operation:** They can operate without a central control point.

## The "Off-Grid" Advantage
- **Single Point of Failure:** A single point of failure can also be a single point of sniffing or filtering.
- **Control:** You don't have to rely on someone else to keep your network running.
- **Privacy:** When you want to share information without being monitored.

## Your Smartphone's Potential
Your smartphone is more than just a device for playing games like Grumpy Fowl. It contains:
- A Wi-Fi chip with a high bandwidth
- A cellular modem and baseband processor
- Numerous sensors
- Quality NAND and RAM
- An underutilized and underclocked processor
- Power supply
- A display that can blink

## The SPAN Framework
- **Overview:** We've done the groundwork so you don't have to.
- **Harnessing SPAN:** Learn how to use SPAN for your own projects.
- **Wi-Fi Chipset Manipulation:** Repurpose root access to modify your Wi-Fi chipset.

### Technical Architecture
- **Blinkie on a Map**
- **Java Networking Interface**
- **TCP and UDP Sockets**
- **MANET Service**
- **Reliable Transmission Layer**
- **Security Manager**
- **Session Manager**
- **P2P Chat App**
- **Other Apps**
- **Network Configuration**
- **Modular MANET Routing Protocol Framework**
- **Routing Protocol Selection (Manual and Automated)**
- **Proactive and Reactive Routing Protocol Managers**
- **Supported Protocols:** OLSR, BATMAN, DSR, etc.
- **iptables / netfilter**
- **Linux Kernel Routing**
- **Transparent Proxy**
- **Data Flow**

### Data Flow Example
1. **Source Node:** Sends "Hello!"
2. **Relay Node:** Determines the route and updates the network topology.
3. **Destination Node:** Receives the message.

### Broadcom Love
- **Ad-Hoc Mode:** Flipping chipsets into Ad-Hoc mode.
- **Kernel vs. Metal:** Vendors should either stop modifying kernel source or provide it to the community.
- **Wi-Fi Tethering:** Leveraged for root users.
- **Edify Script:** For setting up ad-hoc mode using cross-compiled iwconfig.
- **sosAP:** Software-enabled portable wireless access point.
- **Wireless Extensions:** Compiled into the kernel.
- **AnyKernel Tree:** Used for flashing zImage and drivers with ClockworkMod Recovery.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Pros:**
  - Better than everyone sharing everything.
  - Topology info only between MPRs.
  - Incremental improvements.
- **Cons:**
  - MPRs are throughput choke points.
  - Isolated points of failure.
  - Routes planned in advance, but next hop uses its own route.

### Better Approach to Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (2006)
- **Next-gen OLSR:**
  - Decentralized: No single point has all the data.
  - No MPRs.
  - Each node sends out originator messages.

By leveraging these technologies, we can create robust, resilient, and secure off-grid communication networks.
