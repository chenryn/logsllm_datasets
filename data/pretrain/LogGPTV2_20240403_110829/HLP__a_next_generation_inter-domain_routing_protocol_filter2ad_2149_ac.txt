Figure 3: Two forms of cost-hiding.
(a) AS A chooses an alternate route within its own
hierarchy.
(b) AS A chooses a route using an alternate peering
link (A, Y ) and hides the change from its customers.
One needs to be careful while using explicit information
hiding for route update suppression. Whenever an AS sup-
presses a routing change to its neighbor (which routes through
this AS), the routing state maintained by the neighboring
AS becomes stale.
If route suppression is not done cor-
rectly, the staleness it introduces can cause non-transient
routing loops in the system. In HLP, we explicitly use the
vertisements from one provider/peer to another provider/peer
(except indirect peering which allows forwarding across
peers).
2. Prefer customer exception: An AS prefers a non-customer
route over a customer route.
These are the only forms of exceptions to the common
case of policies as speciﬁed by the two guidelines. We will
now ﬁrst discuss the frequency of these exceptions before
describing how we handle them in HLP.

Table 2: Fraction of Internet routes under three-diﬀerent
types of export policy exceptions. Prov-Peer refers to the
fraction of routes where an AS forwards announcements
from a provider to a peer.
We analyzed the frequency of exceptions using BGP rout-
ing table data from Routeviews [30] and RIPE [24] and mea-
sured the fraction of current BGP routes that violate the
default behavior. As shown in Table 3.5.1 for three sample
data-sets, we ﬁnd that roughly 1% of the routes cause an
export policy exception. We repeated the analysis across
diﬀerent time-periods and found comparable results. A re-
cent work by Wang et al. [8] describes a mechanism for in-
ferring the route preference policies of AS’s. Their mea-
surement study shows that most of the AS’s prefer non-
customer routes for less than 0.5% of destination preﬁxes.
In summary, a very small fraction of Internet routes cause
export-policy and prefer-customer exceptions.
3.5.2 Handling export policy exceptions
Figure 4: AS D forwards a route from provider C to
peer E
To violate the AS hierarchy and forward a route from a
provider to a peer, an AS treats the provider-customer link
as a peering link. In ﬁgure 4, AS D forwards routes from
a provider C to a peer E. To do so, it converts the LSA
into an FPV containing the path (D, C).
In the general
case, the FPV appears exactly as it would do if the adjacent
provider-customer links (in this case only link (C, D)) had
been peering links. This translates to the case of having an
FPV traverse multiple peering links.
In a similar fashion, to forward an announcement from a
peer/provider to a provider translates to treating the customer-
provider link as a peering link. Hence, an FPV announce-
ment from a peer/provider will be propagated to the provider
with the path-vector in the FPV including all the three AS’s
involved in the exception.
3.5.3 Handling prefer customer exceptions
Consider the ﬁgure 5 where AS A prefers to choose a non-
customer route (using peering link (A, B)) over a customer
route to destination E. To do so, A performs two opera-
tions. First, A propagates an exception to all its providers
and peers withdrawing its customer route to E. Second,
Figure 5: A wishes to choose a non-customer route
to E
A propagates an FPV corresponding to the chosen non-
provider customer route to its customers. In essence, these
operations are equivalent to executing HLP in the case where
the customer E did not exist in A’s hierarchy. One example
of a prefer-customer exception is the case of backup links to
providers where an AS intends to use these links only during
failure scenarios.
To summarize, HLP supports exceptions in the following
manner: any network that chooses to forward a route in vio-
lation of the constraints on a provider-customer link should
model the link as a peering link (with regards to this route)
and use the normal HLP propagation rules.
4. HLP PROTOCOL ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze the scalability, isolation and
convergence properties of HLP. In this analysis, we explic-
itly assume that all AS’s follow the default policy behavior
and there are no exceptions. Based on our analysis, we
show four important results. First, using explicit informa-
tion hiding coupled with AS-level routing helps in achieving
a 400 fold reduction in the churn rate incurred in HLP in
comparison to BGP. Second, for routing events along 50%
of inter-AS links, HLP can isolate an event to a region 100
times smaller than that of BGP (Section 4.1.2). Third, as
the level of multi-homing increases, the churn and isolation
factors signiﬁcantly improve (Section 4.1.3). Finally, HLP
signiﬁcantly improves the worst-case convergence time over
BGP by explicitly constraining the length of FPVs in HLP
(Section 4.2).
4.1 Scaling and Isolation
To quantify the scaling and isolation aspects of HLP and
compare them with BGP, we need a mechanism to analyze
the routing dynamics of both protocols given the precise
location and type of a routing event. However, given the
complexity and generality of BGP policies, a precise mod-
eling of BGP’s routing dynamics is a challenging problem.
We ﬁrst describe our route-update emulation methodology
which takes a conservative approach towards addressing this
challenge. We later use this emulator to compare the scala-
bility and isolation analysis of HLP and BGP.
4.1.1 Route-update Emulation Methodology
In our conservation approach towards modeling BGP dy-
namics, we assume that the policy behavior of every AS
strictly adheres to the common case behavior based on the
export-rule and prefer-customer guidelines described in Sec-
tion 2.2. Based on this assumption on policies, we built a
route update emulator, the goal of which is to precisely track
the routing updates triggered by a single event. This emu-
lation represents a lower bound on the churn-rate triggered
in BGP since it does not model several intermediary states
of path exploration in BGP. Hence, the churn improvement
numbers we report (i.e., HLP churn/ BGP churn) represent
a lower bound on the actual churn improvement.
The input to the emulator is an AS topology and the set
of inter-AS relationships. We model each AS as a single
entity and for simplicity, we consider only two types of rela-
tionships in the emulator: provider-customer and peer-peer.
Associated with each AS is a set of preﬁxes owned by the
AS.
To compare the scalability and isolation of HLP and BGP,
we restrict our analysis to inter-AS link failures. While sev-
eral other types of events are possible, an inter-AS link fail-
ure (or a BGP session reset) triggers the maximum amount
of churn in BGP since it simultaneously aﬀects routes to
several preﬁxes. We quantify isolation as the number of
AS’s that can potentially be aﬀected by a routing event5
and churn using the total number of updates generated by
an event. Given an inter-AS link in an AS topology, we em-
ulate the route propagation behavior of HLP and BGP for
each destination and compute the number of AS’s that re-
ceive an update about the event in each case. Any AS that
receives an update can potentially be aﬀected by the event.
The improvement in the isolation of HLP is deﬁned as the
ratio of the number of AS’s aﬀected by an event in BGP to
the number of AS’s aﬀected in HLP.
4.1.2 Cost-hiding: best-case analysis
We quantify the eﬀect of churn/fault isolation on a real
Internet AS topology as gathered from RIPE [24] and Route-
views [30] containing 16774 AS’s and 37066 inter-AS links.
We emulate policy-based routing in BGP and compute the
AS hierarchy based on the inference methodology presented
in [27] to characterize links as either provider-customer or
peer-peer. We randomly sample 10,000 inter-AS links and
fail these links in our analysis.
Without making any assumptions on how inter-AS link-
costs are assigned, we begin by analyzing the best-case of
cost-hiding where we set the threshold for cost hiding in
HLP to the best case i.e., allow reroutes regardless of path
cost. Later in Section 4.1.4, we describe the mechanism that
we use to set the cost threshold to approximate the best-case
scenario.
Churn Improvement: The churn reduction in HLP is due
to two factors: (a) using the AS-preﬁx mapping; (b) cost
hiding of route updates. The number of preﬁxes owned by a
single AS is a measure of the gain that this mapping provides
in reducing the churn in BGP. The mean gain, then, is the
average number of preﬁxes owned by each AS. Based on
the (AS, preﬁx) mapping we collected from Routeviews and
RIPE, the mean gain is 7.8. We observed this mean gain
to roughly be stable around 6 − 8 over the last 3 years.
This reduction does not include the additional savings due
to the presence of sub-preﬁxes in BGP for traﬃc engineering
purposes.
The eﬀects of cost-hiding on the churn rate are illustrated
in Figures 6(a) and 6(c). We make the following observa-
tions. First, on an average (assuming that every inter-AS
link has an equal probability of failure), HLP incurs roughly
2% of BGP’s churn which represents a factor 50 reduction in
5Any AS that receives an update due to an event can po-
tentially be aﬀected by the event since the AS can modify
its routing information based on the update.
the net-churn rate. Overall, the net mean churn reduction
due to cost-hiding and AS-preﬁx mapping is 390 = 7.8× 50.
Second, for roughly 50% of the inter-AS links (median churn
ratio in Figure 6(c)), the churn incurred by HLP is nearly 75
times smaller than that of BGP. Third, the churn reduction
of HLP is dependent on the type of inter-AS link that failed.
Cost-hiding provides substantial churn reduction for multi-
homed customers (due to the presence of alternative paths)
but provides no churn reduction for singly-homed customers
(due to lack of alternative paths).
Isolation improvement: Figures 6(b) and 6(c) show the
magnitude of isolation and the isolation improvement achieved
in HLP. Recall that isolation is measured by the number of
AS’s that are aﬀected by a single event. We make the follow-
ing observations from our analysis. First, in the aggregate
case, we found that for 50% of links, HLP has more than a
100 fold improvement in isolation over BGP. Second, more
than 80% of the events are globally visible in BGP. In com-
parison, more than 40% of the events trigger updates to less
than 10 AS’s in HLP. This is because the level of isolation
is dependent on the type of inter-AS link that underwent a
failure.
Overall, in the best case scenario for cost hiding: (a) the
mean churn rate of route advertisements is roughly reduced
by a factor of 390 in comparison to BGP. (b) for roughly 50%
of the inter-AS links, HLP is able to isolate the location of
a fault to a region roughly 100 times smaller than that of
BGP. We repeated the analysis over several AS topologies
ranging from 2002 to 2004 and noticed similar numbers for
the reduction in churn and isolation. Hence, the scale and
isolation gains in HLP are substantial.
4.1.3 Effect of Multi-homing
Figure 7: Churn: Comparing the churn reduction
factor of HLP for diﬀerent types of inter-AS link
events.
As the level of multi-homing increases in the Internet, we
observe the scale and isolation properties to further signif-
icantly improve in HLP. This phenomenon is illustrated in
Figures 7 and 8 which show the distribution of the churn
and isolation factor for events along diﬀerent types of links.
The median (50th percentile) churn reduction factor and
isolation factor for multi-homed customer links are roughly
200 and 1000 respectively. In comparison, the isolation and
churn savings on tier-1 ISPs are relatively small since these
links tend to break many paths and are much harder to hide.
If all stub networks in the Internet were multi-homed, then
we would notice substantial gains in the overall churn and

4.1.4 Determining the cost-hiding threshold
Now, we describe a simple rule of thumb for determining
the cost hiding threshold (denoted by ∆) such that HLP
can approximately achieve the scale and isolation properties
that is achievable in the best-case scenario.
Note that, when AS’s assign costs to routes there must
be some cost-standard to determine meaningful cost values.
