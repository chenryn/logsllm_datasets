    This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.
    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe
    or Services.exe.
    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).
    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.
    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.
    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
    - Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
    - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
    - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
    - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.

    This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service. The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.
    This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event. The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.
    Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
