User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Restarting an IBM BMC without restarting the server itself I have a few servers with IBM BMC (Baseboard Management Controller).  I'd like to power cycle the BMC without restarting the server.  Is this possible? How?

Note: On one of them, the web interface is down; so I'd need to either do this by physically restarting the BMC (not sure how to do this - even the power button on the server isn't supposed to recycle the BMC, I believe) or via the UDP or SNMP interface (again, not sure how to do that either)

Assistant: The simplest way is if you can log onto the server, run as root:

# ipmitool bmc reset cold
