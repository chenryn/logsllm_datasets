User: Please describe the data structure and format of HTTP requests and responses.
Assistant: HTTP requests and responses consist of a request/response line, request/response headers, and a message body. They communicate using ASCII text format. HTTP request format: ``` Request line header line 1 Header line 2 ... Header line n Message body ``` The request line includes the method, URI and protocol version, and each part is separated by a space. For example: ``` GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 ``` HTTP request methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. The request method is used to specify the type and operation of request processing. The request header includes various request metadata, such as Host, Content-Length, User-Agent, etc. The message body contains the actual content of the request. For example, for a POST request, the message body usually contains the form data to be submitted. HTTP response format: ``` Response line header line 1 Header line 2 ... Header line n Message body ``` The response line includes the protocol version, status code and reason phrase, each part is separated by a space. For example: ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK ``` The response status code indicates the corresponding status. For example, 200 means success and 404 means the requested resource was not found. Response headers contain metadata about the response, such as Content-Length, Content-Type, Expires, and more. The message body contains the actual content of the response, such as an HTML web page or JSON data.
