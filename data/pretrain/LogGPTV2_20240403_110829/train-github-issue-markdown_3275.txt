I've a `$.fn.tooltip` plugin (jQuery Tools) and the `$.fn.tooltip`
(Bootstrap). For the moment i can't keep both because of the naming collision.
Can all plugins be renamed to something like `$.fn.bootstrapTooltip` instead
of `$.fn.tooltip` ?
I know this is BC break. Also, i haven't find any discussion on this topic,
hope i haven't created a duplicate issue.
