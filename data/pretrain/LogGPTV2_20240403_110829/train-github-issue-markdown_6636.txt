The `input-append` class appears to be incorrectly affecting elements that trigger tooltips or popovers, as well as child elements within these popovers. Specifically, these elements lose their top-right and bottom-right `border-radius` when the associated tooltip or popover is displayed.

You can observe this issue in the following jsFiddle: [jsFiddle Example](http://jsfiddle.net/gb2YN/)

This problem has been reproduced in the following environments:
- Bootstrap 2.2.2
- Browsers: Chrome 24, Firefox 18.0.2, and Internet Explorer 9

It does not appear to have been resolved in the 2.3.0 work-in-progress (wip) version of Bootstrap.
