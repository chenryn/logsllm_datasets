Elements that trigger tooltips/popovers, as well as child elements in
popovers, seem to be incorrectly affected by the `input-append` class. These
elements lose their top-right and bottom-right `border-radius` when their
associated tooltip/popover displays.
Here is a jsFiddle that shows the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/gb2YN/
Reproducible with Bootstrap 2.2.2 in Chrome 24, Firefox 18.0.2, and IE9.
Doesn't appear to have been fixed in 2.3.0-wip yet.
