Assistant: DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service, distributed denial of service attack) is a method that uses multiple computers or devices to initiate a large number of traffic requests at the same time, causing the server or website to fail to operate or respond normally. In order to prevent and respond to DDoS attacks, the following measures can be considered: 1. Enhance the security and protection capabilities of the network: implement security measures such as network firewalls, intrusion detection and early warning systems, filter out network data packets from abnormal requests, and reduce the impact on the server. shock. 2. Choose a reliable service provider: choose a cloud service provider or a virtual private server (VPS) provider with strong DDoS attack defense capabilities, which can effectively prevent DDoS attacks. 3. Detection of stacked attacks: DDoS attacks often use stacked attacks, using various methods such as attack cache, reverse proxy, and load balancing, so it is necessary to detect this form of attack early. 4. Reserve sufficient bandwidth: DDoS attacks are carried out by simulating real traffic. Therefore, reserving sufficient bandwidth resources can effectively mitigate the impact of attacks. 5. Join the DDoS attack alliance: join the DDoS attack defense alliance, you can enjoy the comprehensive protection service of the alliance and increase the defense strength.
