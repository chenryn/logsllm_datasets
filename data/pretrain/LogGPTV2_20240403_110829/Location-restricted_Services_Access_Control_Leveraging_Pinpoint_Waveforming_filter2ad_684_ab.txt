transmitter is (1,1) and the corresponding received symbol
is at point A on the constellation diagram. For QPSK, the
angle between the ideal point (1, 1) and the horizontal axis
is π
4 . Thus, the coordinate of the received symbol can be
represented by (

is amplitude attenuation factor, and θ is the phase shift
between the received symbol and the ideal point (1, 1).

Channel synchronization aims to calibrate the received
symbols to the corresponding ideal points. Toward this end,
rather than transmitting the ideal points, the transmitter
transmits symbols that deviate from the ideal points in a
way that oﬀset the channel distortion. As shown in Figure
5 (c), the transmitter transmits a symbol A(cid:48), whose phase
shift from the ideal point (1,1) is −θ and the magnitude is

When this symbol arrives at the receiver, the calibration
oﬀset cancels the channel eﬀect, and thereby the received
symbol will converge to the ideal point.

The transmitter needs to know θ and a for the channel
synchronization. Due to the channel reciprocity property,
the wireless channel remains the same if the roles of the
transmitter and the receiver are exchanged [6]. Thus, train-
ing stages can be utilized for the transmitter to measure θ
and a from the training symbols sent by the receiver. To
further reduce the communication overhead, the transmit-
ter can obtain θ and a in the piggyback way. Speciﬁcally,
it can measure them from the symbols that are contained
in the existing up-link packets (e.g., service request packets
and acknowledgement packets) sent by receivers.
2.2.2 Reﬁned Channel Synchronization against the
Multipath Effect
Multipath eﬀect is the phenomena that signals sent by the
transmitter travel along multiple paths to reach the receiver.
Thus, the receiver can receive multiple copies of the origi-
nal signal from the multiple paths. These signal copies can
interfere with each other and confuse the receiver to obtain
an incorrect message decoding results.
The signal propagation paths can be generally classiﬁed as
unresolvable and resolvable paths. For a transmitted sym-
bol, the copies traveling on unresolvable paths arrive at the
receiver with an arrival time diﬀerence less than one symbol
duration, i.e., the transmission time of one symbol. Thus,
they form one symbol on the constellation diagram. For
resolvable paths, the copies traveling on these paths arrive
at the receiver with a time diﬀerence larger than one sym-
bol duration, and therefore on the constellation diagram
they form separate symbols that interfere future transmit-
ted symbols.
In this paper, we only consider the impact
of signal copies from resolvable paths, because they are the
major factors that contribute to the inter-symbol interfer-
ence and the decoding failures. Speciﬁcally, for L resolvable
paths, the receiver will then receive L copies of subsequently
transmitted symbols.
Figure 6 (a) shows an example of a 3-path channel. The
transmitter transmits three symbols S0, S1, and S2. At
time t0, the receiver receives S0 from Path 1. At time t1,
the receiver receives S1 from Path 1 and a delayed copy of
S0 from Path 2. At time t2, the receiver receives S2 from
Path 1, the delayed copy of S1 from Path 2, and the delayed
copy of S0 from Path 3.
Figure 6: Reﬁned channel synchronization against
the multipath eﬀect
We propose to cancel the interference caused by multi-
path symbols via adding a complementary symbol to the
transmitted symbol. Speciﬁcally, Figure 6 (b) shows the
snapshot of the constellation diagram at time t2 for the
aforementioned 3-path channel, the superposed impact of
the delayed copies of S0 and S1 can be represented by an
equivalent symbol Sm, which is the vector sum of S0 and S1.
To eliminate the multipath symbols, in addition to sending
the desired symbol S2, the transmitter also needs to send a
cancelation symbol ¯Sm that is at the reverse position of Sm.
The magnitude of Sm and ¯Sm are the same but ¯Sm shifts
from Sm by an angle of π. As shown in ﬁgure 6 (c), the
vector sum of the desired symbol S2 and ¯Sm is S. Thus, the
transmitter performs the basic synchronization to calibrate
S to S(cid:48) to resist against the channel noise, and the actually
transmitted symbol is S(cid:48).
We would like to point out that ¯Sm can only eliminate the
multipath eﬀects from previous symbols S0 and S1. How-
ever, subsequent symbols will still be interfered by the cali-
brated ¯Sm due to the multipath eﬀects. So all these symbols
should be calibrated in the same way, and the i-th symbol
can be calibrated only after all its previous L − 1 symbols
are already calibrated. We discuss the details in Section 3.
3. MULTIPATH CHANNEL CALIBRATION
To achieve the channel calibration, the transmitter must
ﬁrst get the channel impulse response (CIR), which includes

eﬀects of the multipath propagation. Traditionally, channel
estimation algorithms [7] are applied at the receiver to adapt
received signals to the current channel conditions. How-
ever, we cannot directly use these methods in the proposed
scheme, because we require that signals to reach the receiver
with same shapes to gain the constructive interference. In-
spired by the channel reciprocity that the channel eﬀects
observed by the transmitter and the receiver are the same
during the communication, we propose to directly estimate
the CIR at the transmitter and then use this information to
calibrate the transmit signals.
3.1 Preliminary
To facilitate the presentation of the proposed technique,
we ﬁrst give the preliminary knowledge about the channel
estimation. Channel is usually estimated using a prede-
ﬁned training sequence that are composed of multiple sym-
bols. Speciﬁcally, the training sequence is known to both the
transmitter and the receiver prior to their communication.
The transmitter sends the training sequence to the receiver
through the wireless channel, and upon receiving, the re-
ceiver uses the original training sequence and the received
copy to estimate the channel.
In general, the received training sequence is distorted by
both channel eﬀects and the noise. It can be expressed by
r = h∗ d + n, where h is the channel state information, d is
the original training sequence, ∗ is the convolution operator,
and n is the channel noise that is normally considered as a
zero-mean Gaussian noise. We can rewrite this equation in
the matrix form below.

ing data d, vector [h1, h2, ....., hL]t denotes the unknown
channel h, and [n1, n2, ....., nk]t denotes the unknown chan-
nel noise n. Note that k is the length of the training sequence
and it must be larger than L to enable the estimation of the
channel.
To facilitate our analysis, we rewrite the above matrix
equation into the compact form and we can obtain r =
Dh + n. Normally, least-square (LS) estimator can be used
to solve h from the compact equation for channel estima-
tion [8], yielding the estimation result ˆh = {DHD}−1DHr,
where H denotes the complex conjugate transpose operator.
In our scheme, channel estimation is done at the transmit-
ter, and the training sequence is sent from the receiver. Due
to the channel reciprocity property, the channel estimated
by the transmitter will represent the channel between itself
and the receiver. To cope with the channel changes, the
training sequence can be sent periodically so that the trans-
mitter can capture the current CIR.
3.2 Advanced Channel Calibration
As discussed earlier, we propose to construct a comple-
mentary symbol for each transmitted symbol to cancel the
multipath eﬀect. The complementary symbol for the i-th
transmitted symbol is constructed not only based on the i-
th transmitted symbol but also based on L − 1 previously
transmitted symbols.
Obtaining calibrate symbols: Let ˆh = [ ˆh1, ˆh2, ....., ˆhL]T
denote the estimated channel, and dr = [d1r , d2r , ....., dkr ]T
denote the desired, interference-free received symbols. Fur-
ther let dt = [d1t , d2t , ....., dkt ]T denote the calibrated sym-
bols to be transmitted to the receiver. Note that dt com-
bines both complementary and original symbols. At time
t0, d1t is sent and it arrives at the receiver through the ﬁrst
path. The corresponding received symbol is d1r = d1t · ˆh1.
At time t1, d2t is sent, it arrives at the receiver through the
ﬁrst path, and meantime the multipath copy of d1t arrives
through the second path. The second received symbol can
ˆh1. Finally, at time
hence be presented as d2r = d1t
tk, the receiver will receive both the symbol dkt via the ﬁrst
path and the multipath copies of the previous L − 1 sym-
ˆhi. We
rewrite this linear relation using the matrix form and we
bols. The received symbol dkr is dkr =(cid:80)L

We use the compact matrix form dr = Dtˆh to repre-
sent the above equation. Because Dt includes the calibrated
symbols to be sent by transmitters, we would like to solve
Dt from this equation. Intuitively, it can be computed by
Dt = drˆhH{ˆhˆhH}−1. However, since ˆh is a column vector,
ˆhˆhH is always a singular matrix and it’s not feasible to ﬁnd
its matrix reverse {ˆhˆhH}−1.
In the proposed scheme, the desired data [d1r , d2r , ..., dkr ]
and channel impulse response [ ˆh1, ˆh2, ..., ˆhL] are known. We
can thus ﬁnd Dt by recursively solving linear equations.
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst calibrated symbol d1t can be directly
calculated by d1t = d1r
. With d1t , we can then compute
ˆh1
the second calibrated symbol d2t by d2t = d2r −d1t

Reducing channel estimation errors: To eliminate
the channel noise and accommodate normal temporal vari-
ance, we would like to utilize the zero-mean property of the
channel noise, i.e., to use the average values of multiple chan-
nel estimations to reduce the estimation error. Speciﬁcally,
we set a window of size N , and advance the window so that it
always keeps the most recent N channel estimations. The ul-
timate output channel impulse response is the average of the
N channel estimations in the window. Since the channel es-
timation is given by ˆh = {DHD}−1DHr, and the estimated
(cid:80)N
error is thus {DHD}−1DHn. The average ˆhavg of the N es-
i=1{DHD}−1DHri, and the
timations is 1

When N is chosen large, due to the zero mean property of

Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is always a key metric to eval-
uate the reliability of a wireless communication system. Ac-
cording to Shannon Theorem [1], a large SNR can support
a high speed service than a small SNR on the same chan-
nel bandwidth. Thus, we would like to enable a receiver at
the desired location to always achieve a large SNR, and an
eavesdropper at an undesired location to encounter a low
SNR, so that it cannot distinguish the received signal from
the background noise and fails to decode received data.
The basic idea is to intentionally introduce noise to the
raised transmit signal, so that the noise can signiﬁcantly
reduce the SNR at the eavesdroppers but cancel each other
at the desired receiver to cause no impact.
In order to generate such noise signals for all transmit-
ters, we randomly divide the N transmitters into N
2 pairs.
For each pair, we assign one transmitter with a randomly
generated sequence, whose length is the same as the mes-
sage length. Then, we generate the opposite sequence for
the other transmitter. For example, if the randomly gener-
ated sequence is 1, 1,−1, 1, then the corresponding opposite
sequence is −1,−1, 1,−1. The pair of transmitters add the
corresponding noise sequences to the message and send the
combined signals to the wireless channel. Because the noise
signals are embedded in combined signals, which can syn-
chronize at the desired receiver, the noise signals naturally
achieve the synchronization to enable the cancelation. How-
ever, for the eavesdroppers, due to the lack of the time syn-
chronization and channel calibration, the noise signals fail
to cancel each other and the sum of them still confuse the
eavesdroppers. Moreover, the noise sequences are randomly
generated for each message, and thus the eavesdroppers can-
not guess and pre-determine them.
