Abstract
A  hierarchical  modeling  framework  for  the  dependability
evaluation  of  Internet-based  applications  is  presented  and
illustrated  on  a  travel  agency  example. Modeling  is  carried
out considering  four  levels,  namely:  user,  function, service
and  resource  levels.  The first level describes  how  the  users
invoke  the  application  and  the  three  remaining  levels  detail
how  the  user  requests  are handled  by  the application  at
distinct  abstraction  layers.  The  user  perceived  availability
measure  considered  in  this  paper  takes  into  account  the
failures  and
combined 
traditional
failures. 
For
illustration purposes,  several  sensitivity  analysis  results
are presented to show the impact on this  measure  of  various
assumptions  concerning,  e.g. the  users  operational profile,
the  travel  agency  architecture  and  the  fault  coverage.

1. Introduction
Growing  usage  and  diversity  of  applications  on  the
Internet  make  the  issue  of  assessing  the  dependability  of
the  delivered  services  as  perceived  by 
the users
increasingly  important.  The  Internet  is  often  used  for
transaction  based  money  critical  applications  such  as
online  banking,  stock  trading,  reservation  processing  and
shopping, where the  temporary  interruption  of  service
could have  unacceptable  consequences  on  the  e-business
[1-3].  Given  the  critical  nature  of  such  applications,  the
assessment  of  the  user  perceived quality  of  service  is  a
key issue for  e-business  service  providers  and  developers.
Indeed,  it  is  important  for  the  developers  to  analyze
during  the  architecture design  phase  how  hardware,
software
the
infrastructure supporting  the  delivered  services  might
affect the quality of service perceived by the users.

Internet based  applications  are implemented  on  largely
distributed  infrastructures,  with  multiple interconnected
layers  of  software  and hardware components,  involving
various  types  of  servers such  as  web,  application,  and

such applications: 1) the users (i.e., the customers),  2)  the

internal  to  the  eBP  site(s)  or  are provided  by  external
suppliers, and 3) the external suppliers.
Generally, the eBP has  a  full  control  of  its  own  archi-
tecture. Therefore,  a  detailed  dependability  modeling  and
analysis  of  this  architecture  can  be  carried  out  to  support
design architectural decisions. However, only  limited
information  is  generally  available  to  analyze the depend-
ability  of  the  external suppliers  services.  In  this  context,
remote  measurements  can  be  used  to  evaluate  some
parameters  characterizing 
these
services  [6-9].  These  parameters  can  then  be  incorporated
into the models describing  the  impact  of  eBP  component

The discussion above shows  that  several issues  should
be  taken  into  account  when  modeling  the  user  perceived
dependability  of  Internet  based  applications.  Due  to  the
complexity  of  the  target  system  and  the  difficulty  to
combine  various  types  of  information  (users  behavior,
failure-recovery behaviors  of  the  supporting  infrastruc-
ture),  a  systematic  and  pragmatic  approach  is  needed  to
support  the  construction  of  such  dependability  models
[10].  In  our  work  presented  in  [11],  we  proposed  a
hierarchical  framework  for  modeling  the  user  perceived
dependability  of  e-business  applications.  Modeling  is
done  in  two  steps:  1)  identify  the  functions  and  services
provided  to  the  users  and  the  resources contributing  to
their  accomplishment,  and  characterize how  the  users
interact with the application,  and,  2)  based  on  this,  build
model(s)  to  assess  the  impact  of  component  failures  and
repairs on the quality of service delivered to the users.
This paper  is  aimed  to  illustrate  the  main  concepts  of
this modeling framework using a  web-based  travel  agency
(TA)  as  an  example.  The  objectives are:  1)  to  show  how
to  apply  our  framework  based  on  the  decomposition  of
the  target  application  according  to  four  levels:  user,
function, service and resource levels,  and  2)  to  present
typical  dependability  analysis  and  evaluation  results
obtained  from  modeling,  to  help  the  service  providers  in
making  objective  design  decisions.  The  user  perceived
dependability measure takes  into  account the  combined
impact  of  performance  related  failures  and  traditional
software and hardware failures.  For  illustration  purposes,
several sensitivity  analysis  results  are presented  to  show

assumptions concerning, e.g. the users operational  profile,
the travel agency architecture and the fault coverage.
Section  2  recalls the  main  concepts  of  the  modeling
framework. Sections  3  and  4  present  the  travel  agency
example  and  its hierarchical description.  Section  5  gives
some  examples  of  dependability  evaluation  results.
Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
2. Dependability modeling framework [12]
The  information  needed  for  dependability  modeling
invoked  and 
and analysis is structured into four levels:
• The user  level  describes  the  user  operational  profile  in
terms  of  the  types  of  functions 
the
probability of activation of each of them.
• The  function level  describes  the  set  of  functions
available at the user level.
•  The service level  describes  the  main  services  needed  to
implement each function  and  the  interactions  among
them. Two  categories  of  services  are distinguished:  those
delivered  by  the  eBP (internal  services)  and 
those
provided by external suppliers (external services).
•  The resource level  describes  the architecture  on  which
the
are
implemented.  At  this  level,  the  architecture,  and  fault
tolerance and  maintenance  strategies  implemented  at  the
eBP  site  are detailed.  However,  each  service  provided  by
an  external  supplier  is  represented  by  a  single resource
that is considered as a black box.
identified  at 
services 
the
service
level 
The dependability  modeling  and  evaluation  step  is  di-
rectly  related  to  the  system  hierarchical description.  This
is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1  where the  dependability  measure
considered is availability. The outputs of a given  level  are
used in  the  next  immediately  upper  level  to  compute  the
availability  measures  associated  to  this  level  (denoted  by
A(x) where x is a user, a function, a service  or  a  resource).
Accordingly, at the  service level, each  service  availability
is  derived  from  the  availability  of  the  resources involved
in  its  accomplishment.  Similarly,  at  the  function  level,
the  availability  of  each function  is  obtained  from  the
availability  of  the  services implementing  it.  Finally,  at
the user level, the availability  measures are obtained from
the availability of the functions invoked by the users.
Various  techniques  can  be  used  to  model  each level:
fault  trees,  reliability  block  diagrams,  Markov  chains,
stochastic  Petri  nets,  etc.  The  selection  of  the  right
technique  mainly  depends  on  the  kinds  of  dependencies
between the  elements  of  the  considered  level  and  on  the
quantitative measures  to  be  evaluated.  In  Section  4,  we
mainly make use of block diagrams and Markov  chains  to
evaluate the availability of the travel agency.

As  regards 
the  state  of 
the  proposed
hierarchical description  builds  on  some  of  the  concepts
proposed in [13] to  analyze the performance  of  e-business
applications. However,  as  our  framework  focuses  on
dependability, we have adapted these  concepts  and  refined
them to fulfill the objectives of our study.

E-business system availability modelling
Figure 1. Hierarchical availability modeling framework
The  evaluation  of  quantitative  measures  characterizing
user-perceived dependability for  web-based  applications  is
widely recognized as highly important  to  faithfully  reflect
the  impact  of  failures  from  the  business  point  of  view
[14], However, there is  still  a  lack  of  modeling  examples
illustrating how to address this issue.  The  work  presented
in  this  paper intends  to  fill  this  gap  by  illustrating  on  a
simplified  example  how  the  modeling  can  be  carried  out
and what kinds of practical results can be derived.
3. The Travel Agency (TA) example
The  TA  is  designed  to  allow  the  users  to  plan  and
book trips over the web. For this end,  it  interacts  through
dedicated interfaces with several flight reservation  systems
(AF,  KLM,  …),  hotel  reservation systems  (Sofitel,
Holiday Inn, …), and car rental systems (Hertz, …).
The  TA  can  be  seen  as  composed  of  two  basic
components: the client side and the server side.  The  client
side handles user’s  inputs,  performs  necessary  checks  and
forwards the data to the  server side  component.  The  latter
is  the  main  component  of  the  TA.  It  is  designed  to
respond  to  a  number  of  calls  from  the  client  side
concerning e.g.,  availability  checking,  booking,  payment
and  cancellation  of  each item  of  a  trip.  It  handles  all
transactions to, and from, the booking systems,  composes
items  into  full  trips,  converts  incoming  data  into  a
common data structure and finally handles all exceptions.
Starting from this  very  high-level  description,  we  will
further detail  it  according  to  the  various  aspects  required
for the hierarchical description. We  will  first  focus  on  the
function  and  user  levels  together,  then  the  service  and
function levels before addressing the resource level.
3.1.  Function  and  User  levels
The behavior of the users accessing  the  TA  web  site  is
characterized by  the  operational  profile  example  presented
in  Figure  2.  The  nodes  “Start”  and  “Exit”  represent  the
start  and  end  of  a  user  visit  to  the  TA  web  site,  and  the

other  nodes  identify  the  functions  invoked  by  the  users
during  their  visit.  For  the  sake  of  illustration,  we  have
considered five functions for the TA example:
• Home: invoked when a user accesses the TA home page.
• Browse:  the  customer  navigates  through  the  links
available  at  the  TA  site  to  view  any  of  the  pages  of  the
site. These links  include  the  weekly promotions, help
pages, frequent queries, etc.
• Search:  the  TA  checks the  availability  of  trip  offers
corresponding to the criteria  specified  by  the  customer.  A
user request can be composed of a flight, a hotel  and  a  car
reservation.  Based  on  the  information  provided  by  the
user,  the  TA  converts  the  user  requests  into transactions
to  several  hotel,  flight  and  car reservation systems  and
returns the results of the search to the user.
• Book:  the  customer  chooses  the  trip  that  suits  his
request and confirms his reservation.
• Pay: the customer is ready to pay for the reservation fees
for the trips booked on the TA site.

Figure 2. User operational profile graph
The  transitions  among  the  nodes  and  the  associated
probabilities pij  describe  how  the  users  interact  with  the
TA  web  site.  A  given  class  of  users  is  defined  by  a
specific set  of  pij.  These  probabilities  can  be  obtained  by
collecting data on the web site (see e.g., [15]).
The  operational  profile  defines  all  user  execution
scenarios (or shortly, user scenarios) when visiting the  TA
web site. Each scenario  is  defined  by  the  set  of  functions
invoked and the probability of  activation  of  each function
in  the  corresponding  scenario.  The  “Start”  and  “Exit”
nodes denote the beginning and end of a user scenario.
The  identification  of  the  most  frequently  activated
scenarios  gives  useful  insights  into  the  most  significant
scenarios  to  be  considered  when  evaluating  the user
perceived dependability.  Indeed,  the  higher  the  activation
probability  of  a  given  scenario,  the  higher  its  impact  on
the  dependability  perceived  at  the  user  level.  Such
measure is affected  by  the  dependability  of  the  functions,
services and resources involved in this scenario.
Table 1 lists the  user  execution scenarios  derived  from
Figure 2 and gives the  probabilities  of  these  scenarios  (in
terms  of  percentage),  associated  to  two  customer  profiles
(denoted as user class  A  and  user  class  B).  The  notations
