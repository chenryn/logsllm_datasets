ABSTRACT
We present two protocols for reducing oblivious transfer
(OT) to the security of trapdoor permutations and to the
hardness of some coding problems, respectively. The (cid:12)rst
protocol is the most e(cid:14)cient known to date, while the sec-
ond one is a theoretical proof-of-concept. Our construc-
tions leverage the power of Interactive Hashing (IH). The
(cid:12)rst protocol can be viewed as a simple modi(cid:12)cation of the
well-known OT construction by Even, Goldreich and Lem-
pel (1985), in which a receiver must send a random domain
element to a sender through IH. Alternatively, our protocol
can be viewed as a simple modi(cid:12)cation of the construction
by Ostrovsky, Venkatesan and Yung (1993), in which the
players substitute the one-way permutation with a trapdoor
permutation. We use a similar approach to derive a second
OT protocol based on coding assumptions related to security
of the McEliece cryptosystem. In our second construction,
the receiver inputs a public key into IH while privately keep-
ing the corresponding secret key. Two di(cid:11)erent versions of
IH are used: the computationally secure one in the (cid:12)rst pro-
tocol, and the information-theoretically secure one in the
second.

INTRODUCTION
Oblivious transfer is one of the central cryptographic prim-
itives, since it implies secure two- (and multi-)party compu-
tation [11]. Oblivious transfer (OT) was initially proposed
in several (cid:13)avors [25, 22, 8] which all turned out to be equiv-
alent [4]. We will focus on the one-out-of-two (1-2) OT [8]
which is a two-party primitive, where a honest sender inputs
two bits b0, b1 and a honest receiver chooses to obtain one of
them, bc, by inputting his choice bit c. The cheating sender
must remain ignorant of c, while the cheating receiver { un-
able to learn both bits. In this work, we focus on a version
of 1-2 OT where both inputs and the choice bit are uniform-
ly random.
It can be done without loss of generality due
to the (very e(cid:14)cient) randomized self-reduction of OT [1,
Section 3.2] { it only takes 1 round, 3 bits of communication
and computing of 3 bit-wise exclusive-ors. The reduction is
information-theoretic in nature, i.e. no additional assump-
tions are required.

Interactive hashing (IH) has proven to have many appli-
cations in cryptography, for instance, in bit commitment,
zero-knowledge, and unconditional oblivious transfer proto-
col design (see e.g. [23, Sec. 2.1] for a survey).
IH is a two-party primitive, where a honest sender inputs
a string w 2 f0; 1gn, and both it and a honest receiver ob-
′ 2R f0; 1gn n w. The
tain on the output (w; w
hiding property requires that the cheating receiver cannot
tell which of (w; w
) was the input. According to the bind-
) is e(cid:11)ectively beyond the
ing property, at least one of (w; w
control of the cheating sender.
IH comes in two version-
s: with computational binding (initiated by [21]), we call it
C-IH, and information-theoretic binding (initiated by [2]),
we call it IT-IH. Hiding is information-theoretic in both (cid:13)a-
vors. Both protocols are very similar (the slight di(cid:11)erence is
in the way the receiver’s queries are constructed), the main
di(cid:11)erence is in the formulations of security properties, and
hence the di(cid:11)erent security proofs.
1.2 Related Work
′
In fact, C-IH has already been used for implementing OT
from one-way permutations (OWP) by Ostrovsky, Venkate-
san and Yung [21] (we will refer to this construction as the
OVY-protocol), but in that work, one of the honest players
had to invert OWP (i.e. to be computationally strong). In
contrast, our work admits honest players which are bound-
448
ed to probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) { for the price
of strengthening the assumption to trapdoor permutations
(TDP).
OT from TDP is considered in a line of works [8, 12],
where the protocols are designed to be secure against pas-
sively cheating players. Protection against active attackers
is achieved using secure compilers [11, 13].
OT from coding based assumptions was recently construc-
ted by Dowsley, van de Graaf, M(cid:127)uller-Quade and Nascimen-
to [6] and Kobara, Morozov and Overbeck [16]. The work
[6] is based on standard assumptions, while a non-standard
assumption on hardness of decoding partly random codes is
used in [16].
We note that the same construction as our coding based
scheme (Protocol 2) has been independently discovered by
Claude Cr(cid:19)epeau and J(cid:127)orn M(cid:127)uller-Quade [M(cid:127)uller-Quade, per-
sonal communication].
1.3 Our contribution
We investigate a connection between the primitives of
oblivious transfer and interactive hashing by constructing
two (quite simple) protocols using the two versions of IH
and, correspondingly, two types of computational assump-
tions. Both our protocols are proved secure in the stand-
alone model against active attacks.
Our (cid:12)rst protocol can be considered as the following (sim-
ple) modi(cid:12)cation of either of the two famous OT construc-
tions: 1) In the one by Even, Goldreich and Lempel [8]
(we will call it the EGL-protocol), a receiver must send a
random domain element to a sender using C-IH1; 2) In the
OVY-protocol [21], the players should replace OWP with T-
DP. We explicitly require that the domain of TDP should be
e(cid:14)ciently representable in binary, such that each encoding
is valid.2
Our protocol has the communication cost O(n2)+F , where
n is the size (in bits) of the TDP’s domain and F is the size
of representation of the TDP’s index. This cost is essential-
ly that of [21], which is O(n2) { if we assume for simplicity
that the size of the OWP’s domain is also n. Our protocol
and the OVY-protocol need to compute TDP (resp. OWP)
three times and also n(cid:0)1 scalar products of n-bit strings. In
addition, our protocol inverts the TDP once, using its trap-
door, while in [21] the sender inverts OWP (as it is assumed
to be computationally powerful). Both protocols have n
rounds. One can see that both protocols have a comparable
e(cid:14)ciency, while our scheme allows both the honest sender
and the honest receiver to be PPT. Also, we achieve a n-
early round-optimal OT protocol with information-theoretic
receiver-security based on TDP in black-box manner.
Its
round complexity is n, while the lower bound is (cid:2)(n= log n)
[14, Sec. 7.3].
The compiler by Haitner [13] requires the receiver in passi-
vely-secure OT to commit to his random coins, which must
be at least of the size of two domain elements (i.e. 2n). In or-
der to provide the information-theoretic receiver-security the
statistically hiding commitments must be used. The most
e(cid:14)cient construction of the latter [15] uses C-IH, hence our
protocol { by the virtue of using C-IH only once { is de(cid:12)-
nitely more e(cid:14)cient than the straight forward application of
the Haitner’s compiler [13] to the EGL protocol.
1The EGL protocol is only secure against passive attacks.
2Note that this assumption is implicitly present in [21, 20].
Our second protocol extends the presented approach by
constructing OT with computational security for both play-
ers using the coding based assumptions underlying security
of the McEliece public key cryptosystem (PKC) [18]. Cod-
ing based schemes are interesting due to their resistance a-
gainst attacks using quantum computer. In our second pro-
tocol, the receiver sends a public key to the sender using
IT-IH, while privately keeping the corresponding secret key.
In order to obtain the proof of sender-security, we take a
non-standard coding assumption: loosely speaking, we sup-
pose that the codes, which can work as public keys for the
McEliece-type cryptosystem, do not constitute a substantial
(non-negligible) fraction of all linear codes. We believe that
this assumption is quite plausible, since quite a few candi-
dates are known so far [7, Sec. 1.1].
Taking n to be the length of the code, our protocol us-
es O(n2) rounds, has the communication cost O(n4) and
the computation cost of two McEliece encryptions and one
decryption plus O(n2) scalar products of O(n2)-bit strings.
In comparison, both [6] and [16] have communication cost
O(n2 log n), where the quadratic factor comes from send-
ing the McEliece public keys and the logarithmic factor
comes from usage of cut-and-choose technique in [6] and
zero-knowledge proof in [16]. The computation cost of the
