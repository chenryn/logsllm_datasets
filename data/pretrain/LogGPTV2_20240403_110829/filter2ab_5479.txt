titleblackhat:us-23 Making and Breaking NSA's Codebreaker Challenge
For the past 10 years, the National Security Agency (NSA) has hosted the Codebreaker Challenge. This competition, written and run by NSA's technical experts, includes a new theme and challenge each year. The challenges are custom designed by NSA to mimic a real-world problem NSA faces in its mission and include up to 10 rounds of increasing difficulty including code analysis and reverse engineering. Starting with only 5 schools in 2013, the program has grown exponentially. In 2022, more than 4,800 participants from 449 schools across the United States competed for bragging rights. Only 104 people (about 2%) successfully completed all 9 rounds of the challenge this past year. For the very first time at Black Hat, the NSA will publicly share insights and lessons from running the Codebreaker Challenge. We will present details about the design of the 2022 challenge that focused on the NSA assisting FBI agents in responding to a US company that had been crippled by a ransomware attack.
