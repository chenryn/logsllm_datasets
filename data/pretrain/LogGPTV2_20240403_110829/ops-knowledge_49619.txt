User: I have 3 main folder in Windows explorer that contain files with naming like this  ALB_01_00000_intsect_d.kml or Baxters_Creek_AL_intsect_d.kml. Even though the first name changes the consistent thing that I would like to remove from all these files is "_intsect_d". Would like to do this for all files within each of the folders. The files have an extension .kml. The result I am expecting as per the example above is ALB_01_00000.kml and the other one would be 
Baxters_Creek_AL.kml. Dont know much about programming in python, but would like help to write a script that can acheive the result mentioned above. Thanks
Assistant: I don't have enough reputation to comment on nicholas's solution, but that code breaks if any of the folder names contain the character you want to replace.
For instance, if you want to newname = path.replace('_', '') but your path looks like /path/to/data_dir/control_43.csv you will get an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
