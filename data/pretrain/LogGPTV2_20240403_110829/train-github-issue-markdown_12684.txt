I know there's other projects who added RTL support to bootstrap but these are
two different projects now so if a bug fix or a new feature is added in
bootstrap, it's wouldn't show on the RTL project.  
I had an idea, not sure if it'll work but if so, LTR and RTL can be supported
from the same project without maintaining two different copies of things.
Add these variables in variables.less  
@Left: left;  
@right: right;  
In every other .less file, whenever have use of left/right (such as margin-
left) use @left/@right instead.  
Compile and you'll get the same output as today.  
Set @Left: right; and @right: left; and compile again. That should give RTL
support.
Would that work?
