### Expected Behavior
Calling `BrowserWindow.setBounds()` (or `BrowserWindow.setSize()`) before
calling `BrowserWindow.show()` should show the window with correct size
without showing transition flashing between previous size and the new size.
### Actual Behavior
The window _flashes_ from the previous lower size to the new higher size (not
viceversa).
### Testcase Gist URL

This has been tested on Windows 10 and macOS (although here seems to be less
noticeable, more with transparency enabled).
The window show a flash tranisition between previous size (`height: 200`) to
new one (`height: 600`). This seems to happen only from a lower size to a
higher one. In fact, from `height: 600` to `height: 200` the transition flash
does not seem to occur.  
The gist test I've created registers a global shortcut `Ctrl(Cmd)+Shift+T`
that shows/hides the window changing its bounds before toggling the
visibility.
(For flash I mean a few milliseconds you can see the previous window size and
right after the new size gets applied)
