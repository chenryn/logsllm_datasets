### Electron Version
11.3.0

### Operating System
Windows 10, version 20H2 (build 19042.870)

### Architecture
x64

### Last Known Working Electron Version
Not applicable

### Expected Behavior
When calling `BrowserWindow.setBounds()` or `BrowserWindow.setSize()` before `BrowserWindow.show()`, the window should display at the correct size without any visual transition or flashing between the previous and new sizes.

### Actual Behavior
The window flashes from the previous smaller size to the new larger size. This behavior is not observed when transitioning from a larger size to a smaller one. The flashing effect is more noticeable on Windows 10, especially with transparency enabled, but it can also be seen on macOS.

### Testcase Gist URL
https://gist.github.com/xpirt/4e3e92fcd866fcf812c49d8439b6f6d2

### Detailed Description
The provided Gist test demonstrates the issue by registering a global shortcut (`Ctrl + Shift + T` on Windows, `Cmd + Shift + T` on macOS) that toggles the visibility of the window while changing its bounds. The flash occurs in the transition from a smaller height (e.g., 200 pixels) to a larger height (e.g., 600 pixels). Conversely, the transition from a larger height to a smaller height does not exhibit this flashing behavior.

**Note:** The flash is a brief visual artifact (lasting a few milliseconds) where the previous window size is briefly visible before the new size is applied.
