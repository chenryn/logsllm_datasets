User: I have a python gui that access files on windows as C:\data and C:\MyDIR all outside my doc's.
On, a linux sys i created /data and /MyDIR.
My gui cant access. I foresee always using C:\data and C:\MyDIR on both systems.  
How do I fix code or Linux permissions to have access to both dir and sub directories.
Assistant: Chmod is your friend.
However I question your design. Why do you want to have priviledges at such high levels of file systems. You know every user has a home dir and ther is always dir for configuration on both Windows and Linux.
What you do is a bad practice.
