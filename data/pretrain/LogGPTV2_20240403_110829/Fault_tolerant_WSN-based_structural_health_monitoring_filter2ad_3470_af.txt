since  faulty  sensor  nodes  have  been  deleted,  mode  shape 
values  corresponding  to  these  sensor  nodes  do  not  exist. 
Considering  that  missing  of  these  values  on  mode  shapes 
will  affect  the  damage  detection  accuracy,  these  values  are 
estimated using the cubic spline interpolation[22]. Since this 
technique is only applicable for 2D curves, mode shapes of 
the  sensor  nodes  in  the  upper  side  and  lower  side  of  the 
middle  span  are  interpolated  independently.  For  the  sensor 
nodes  on  the  upper  side,  mode  shape  values  on  identified 
faulty  sensors  #3,#9,#15,#27  are  estimated.  For  the  sensor 
nodes  at  the  bottom  side,  mode  shape  values  on  sensors 
#36,#48  are  estimated.  Fig.  20  and  Fig.  21  illustrate  the 
interpolated mode shapes and mode shape curvatures for the 
upper  side  and  lower  side  sensors,  respectively.  From  the 
mode shape curvatures, the damage is located which is at the 
points with large mode shape curvatures (in Fig. 20, damage 
is detected at locations corresponding to #12 and #13, in Fig. 
21, damage is detected at locations near #41 and #42).    This

IMPLEMENTATION 
The  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  approaches  is  tested 
through  a  real  implementation.  To  address  the  generally 
high  requirements  of  SHM  application,  we  designed  a 
particular type of  wireless sensor nodes called SHM  mote. 
This  SHM  tailored  sensor  node  includes  Imote2,  a  sensor 
board  and  radio-triggered  wakeup  &  synchronization 
unit(see Fig.22(a)). The testing structure has 12 floors, and 
the SHM  motes are deployed on each floor to  monitor the 
structure’s  horizontal  accelerations  under  hammer  strike 
(see  Fig.  22(b)).  Although  the  deployed  SHM  motes  can 
form  a  complete  network  in  general  condition,  we  use  the 
topology  of  the  network  shown  in  Fig.  22(c)  to  test  the 
effectiveness of the clustering algorithms. The SHM motes 
run  modified  TinyOS  and  are  configured  to  sample  the 
accelerometers at frequency of 256Hz.    Structural damage 
in  this  test  is  generated  by  releasing  a  support  ring  on  the 
third  floor  (See  Fig.  22(b)).  Meanwhile,  sensors  which 
should  be  tightly  attached  on  the  5th  and  8th  floors  are 
released to generate faulty readings on these two nodes. We 
aim to detect the structural damage in the presence of these 
two faulty sensor nodes. 
Figure 22 The SHM mote and test structure (a) the SHM mote (b) test 
structure (c) network topology (d) clustering results 
The first step is clustering. This lab structure is relatively 
simple and the deployed 12 SHM motes can be regarded as 
in the same substructure. Using the two clustering methods 
proposed  in  the  paper,  the  same  clusters  are  generated  and 
illustrated  in  Fig.  22(d).  This  clustering  is  implemented 
offline in a laptop computer before we do the test. 
Through  a  gateway  mote  connected  with  the  computer, 
CHs in these two clusters (#4 and #9) are designated. In each 
SHM  mote,  the  natural  frequency  set  is  extracted and  send 
back to the corresponding CH as well as the gateway.    Fig. 
23 (a) illustrates the identified natural frequency sets in the 
first  cluster.  Fig.  23(b)  shows  the std((cid:2280)(cid:2929))  in  the  first  4 
that std((cid:2280)(cid:2929))  drops sharply after sensor #5 is deleted while 
iterations in the frequency matching process. It can be seen 
remains stable after deleting others. Thus sensor #5 is labeled 
as faulty. Another faulty sensor node #8 is also successfully 
detected in another cluster.

After faulty sensor nodes have been detected and isolated, 
mode shapes of each cluster are estimated in corresponding 
CH  using  the  ERA  algorithm.  In  this  test,  mode  shapes 
corresponding to the natural frequency set {4.12Hz，21.4Hz} 
are  extracted  in  both  clusters  and  then  sent  back  to  the 
gateway, where the mode shapes at the healthy sensor nodes 
are first interpolated and then double differentiated to obtain 
mode  shape  curvatures.  Fig.  24  illustrates  the  mode  shape 
curvatures. By examining the curvatures, damage is detected 
at #3, which matches with the correct damage location.

VI.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
is  preserved  and 
the  wireless  communication 
In  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  fault-tolerant  scheme  for 
WSN-based  SHM  systems.  This  scheme  is  able  to  detect 
structural  damage  in  the  presence  of  the  faulty  readings.   
Through clustering, the redundancy in the natural frequency 
sets 
is 
minimized.  Faulty  sensor  nodes  are  then  detected  through 
natural  frequency  matching.  Mode  shape  curvatures  of  the 
remaining nodes are used to detect structural damage. Faulty 
sensor  detection  and  structural  damage  detection 
is 
efficiently  integrated  together  and  the  proposed  scheme  is 
able  to  disambiguate  structural  damage  from  sensor  faults. 
The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated 
through both simulation and a real implementation.
