User: It seems when I try to research all I can find are how many lines are in Linux, call of duty, windows and other things that are massive applications with millions of lines of code.
Does anyone have examples of code size of applications that don't take teams and teams of people?
P.S.
I'm 24 yrs old and just starting to learn I feel like I got a really late start but I'm tired of sales and love technology so I'm just looking for something to gauge by.
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: Code length depends completely on the type of the application you want to design. It also depends on the language of choice.  A program written in c will likely be significantly longer than say code in python. 
It's never to late to learn!
