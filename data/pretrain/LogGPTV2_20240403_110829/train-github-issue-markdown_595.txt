### Describe the problem
I found MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy has been supported in Estimator. However,
it seems that only works with in-graph mode. And the comments here shows it
will support between-graph mode in the future.
`# TODO(yuefengz): support between-graph replication.`
I want to know the progress of the between-graph development. Whether it is in
progress or even has not started yet？ If it has been in progress, when does it
release in master branch？
Thank you.
