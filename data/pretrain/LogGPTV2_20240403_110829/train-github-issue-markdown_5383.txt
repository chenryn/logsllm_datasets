I cannot understand why the result of `take` can be visited by a for loop
while throwing an error when put in a list comprehension, such as the code
    for x in take(repeated(2), 10)
        println(x)
    end
works well but the following code
    [x for x in take(repeated(2), 10)]
throws an error,
LoadError: MethodError: `length` has no method matching
length(::Base.Take{Base.Repeated{Int64}})
