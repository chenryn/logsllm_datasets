### 1. Introduction to the Security Game

In this section, we describe a security game involving a challenger and an adversary \( A \). The game proceeds in several phases as follows:

1. **Setup Phase:**
   - The challenger generates a master key \( mk \) and public parameters \( params \).
   - The challenger provides \( params \) to the adversary \( A \), while keeping \( mk \) secret.

2. **Phase 3: Private Key Extraction Queries:**
   - Adversary \( A \) issues private key extraction queries, each denoted by an identity \( ID \).
   - A restriction is imposed such that for all queried identities \( ID \), the intersection with the target identity \( ID^* \) must satisfy \( |ID \cap ID^*| < d \).

3. **Phase 4: Challenge Ciphertext Generation:**
   - Adversary \( A \) outputs two equal-length messages \( M_0 \) and \( M_1 \).
   - The challenger randomly selects \( \beta \in \{0, 1\} \) and creates a challenge ciphertext \( C^* = \text{Encrypt}(params, ID^*, M_\beta) \).
   - The challenger returns \( C^* \) to \( A \).

4. **Phase 5: Additional Private Key Extraction Queries:**
   - Adversary \( A \) issues additional private key extraction queries, subject to the same restriction as in Phase 3.

5. **Phase 6: Guessing the Challenge Bit:**
   - Adversary \( A \) outputs its guess \( \beta' \in \{0, 1\} \).

The adversary's guessing advantage is defined as:
\[ \text{Advantage} = \left| \Pr[\beta' = \beta] - \frac{1}{2} \right| \]

A stronger notion of security, "indistinguishability under fuzzy selective-ID, chosen ciphertext attack (IND-FSID-CCA)," can be defined by providing the adversary access to a decryption oracle.

### 2. Security Against Colluding Attacks

Another critical security requirement for a fuzzy IBE scheme is resistance to colluding attacks. This means that no group of users should be able to combine their keys in such a way that they can decrypt a ciphertext that none of them could decrypt individually [8].

### 3. Proposed Fuzzy IBE Schemes

#### 3.1 Preliminaries

For \( a \in \mathbb{Z}_q^* \) (where \( q \) is a prime), and a set \( S \) of elements in \( \mathbb{Z}_q^* \), the Lagrange coefficient \( \Delta_{a,S} \) is defined as:
\[ \Delta_{a,S}(x) = \prod_{b \in S, b \neq a} \frac{x - b}{a - b} \]

Without loss of generality, we assume that an identity is a set of \( n \) different elements in \( \mathbb{Z}_q^* \). For example, each of \( n \) strings of arbitrary length with an index \( i \in \mathbb{Z} \) can be hashed using a collision-resistant hash function whose range is \( \mathbb{Z}_q^* \).

#### 3.2 Efficient Fuzzy IBE-I (EFIBE-I) Scheme

**Setup:**
- Choose \( g_1 \in G_1 \) at random.
- Pick \( s \in \mathbb{Z}_q^* \) at random and compute \( g_2 = g_1^s \).
- Select a hash function \( H : \mathbb{Z}_q^* \to G_1 \).
- Set a tolerance parameter \( d \).
- Output public parameters \( params = (q, g, e, G_1, G_2, H, g_1, g_2, d) \) and master key \( mk = (q, g, e, G_1, G_2, H, g_1, g_2, x) \).

**Extract(mk, ID), where \( ID = (\mu_1, \ldots, \mu_n) \):**
- Pick a random polynomial \( p(·) \) of degree \( d - 1 \) over \( \mathbb{Z}_q \) such that \( p(0) = s \).
- Compute a private key \( D_{\mu_i} = (\gamma_{\mu_i}, \delta_{\mu_i}) = ((g_1 H(\mu_i))^{p(\mu_i)}, g^{p(\mu_i)}) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \).
- Return \( D_{ID} = (D_{\mu_1}, \ldots, D_{\mu_n}) \).

**Encrypt(params, \( ID', M \)), where \( ID' = (\mu'_1, \ldots, \mu'_n) \) and \( M \in G_2 \):**
- Pick \( r \in \mathbb{Z}_q^* \) at random.
- Compute \( C' = (ID', U, V_{\mu'_1}, \ldots, V_{\mu'_n}, W) \), where:
  - \( U = g_1^r \)
  - \( V_{\mu'_i} = (H(\mu'_i))^r \)
  - \( W = e(g_1, g_2)^r M \)

**Decrypt(params, \( D_{ID}, C' \)), where \( C' \) is encrypted with \( ID' \) such that \( |ID \cap ID'| \geq d \):**
- Choose an arbitrary set \( S \subseteq ID \cap ID' \) such that \( |S| = d \).
- Compute:
  \[ M = \frac{\prod_{\mu_j \in S} e(V_{\mu_j}, \delta_{\mu_j})^{\Delta_{\mu_j, S}(0)}}{e(U, \prod_{\mu_j \in S} \gamma_{\mu_j}^{\Delta_{\mu_j, S}(0)})} \]
- Return \( M \).

The above decryption algorithm is correct. The EFIBE-I scheme is proven to be IND-FSID-CPA secure in the random oracle model, assuming the DBDH problem is hard. The proof is provided in the full version of this paper [1].

### 4. Comparisons

Table 1 summarizes the size of various parameters and the computational cost of the proposed fuzzy IBE schemes and the random oracle version of the Sahai-Waters construction [7], denoted as SW-RO.

- Both the Extract and Encrypt algorithms of EFIBE-II are more efficient than those of SW-RO.
- The Extract algorithm of EFIBE-I is the most efficient among the three schemes, but its Encrypt algorithm is slightly less efficient than those of EFIBE-II and SW-RO.

### 5. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we propose two efficient fuzzy IBE schemes, which are proven to be secure in the random oracle model. We expect these new fuzzy IBE schemes to serve as efficient building blocks for biometric authentication systems or attribute-based encryption systems. Constructing fuzzy IBE schemes with the same structure as ours, but without relying on the random oracle model, remains an interesting open problem.
