ate a master key mk and public parameters params. The
Challenger gives params to A while keeps mk secret from
A. In Phase 3, A issues private key extraction queries, each
of which is denoted by ID. A restriction here is that for
all ID, |ID ∩ ID
∗| < d. In Phase 4, A outputs equal-length
messages M0 and M1. Upon receiving (M0, M1), the Chal-
lenger picks β ∈ {0, 1} at random and creates a challenge
ciphertext C∗ = Encrypt(params, ID
∗, Mβ). The Challenger
returns C∗ to A. In Phase 5, A issues a number of private
key extraction queries as in Phase 3. In Phase 6, A outputs
its guess β(cid:48) ∈ {0, 1}.
We deﬁne A’s guessing advantage by | Pr[β(cid:48) = β] − 1
2|.
Notice that a stronger notion “indistinguishability of en-
cryptions under fuzzy selective-ID, chosen ciphertext attack
(IND-FSID-CCA)” can also be deﬁned by giving A an access
to a decryption oracle.
Another important security requirement for a fuzzy IBE
scheme is the security against colluding attack, which im-
plies that no group of users should be able to combine their
keys in such a way that they can decrypt a ciphertext that
none of them alone could [8].

Note that one can easily show that the above decryption
algorithm is correct. The above EFIBE-II scheme is proven
to be IND-FSID-CPA secure in the random oracle model
assuming that the DBDH problem is hard. The proof is
given in the full version of this paper [1].
We also note that from the same reason as EFIBE-I,
EFIBE-II is also secure against collusion attacks.
Finally we remark that EFIBE-I and EFIBE-II can be ex-
tended to achieve chosen ciphertext security using the tech-
nique like the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform [5].
4. COMPARISONS
Table 1 summarizes the size of various parameters and the
cost of computing sub-algorithms of the proposed fuzzy IBE
schemes and the random oracle version of the Sahai-Waters
construction [7], which we denote by SW-RO.
Notice that both Extract and Encrypt algorithms of EFIBE-
II are more eﬃcient than those of SW-RO. The Extract al-
gorithm of EFIBE-I is the most eﬃcient among the three
schemes but its Encrypt is slightly less eﬃcient than those of
EFIBE-II and SW-RO.
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper we proposed two eﬃcient fuzzy IBE schemes,
which are proven to be secure in the random oracle model.
We expect that our new fuzzy IBE schemes will serve
as eﬃcient building blocks for biometric authentication sys-
tems or attribute-based encryption systems. Construction of
fuzzy IBE schemes that have the exactly the same structures
as ours (that is, non-random oracle version of our schemes
using the technique of [8]) is an interesting open problem.
