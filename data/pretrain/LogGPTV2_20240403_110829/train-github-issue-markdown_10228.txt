Note that this same issue was reported back in 2017 on the now-archived repo:
npm/npm#15783
### Current Behavior:
I am using `npm link` to try to test changes I am making to an upstream
dependency within my own project. In the dependency directory I run `npm
link`. Then in my own project I run `npm link ffmpeg-stream`.
NPM gives the following error message when running the second link command:
    npm ERR! code 1
    npm ERR! path D:\git\node-ffmpeg-stream
    npm ERR! command failed
    npm ERR! command C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /d /s /c "tsc"
    npm ERR! Version 3.9.7
    npm ERR! Syntax:   tsc [options] [file...]
Afterwards, the directory of the upstream dependency is empty. Even the `.git`
directory is deleted, so tough luck if you haven't pushed recently.
### Expected Behavior:
NPM link should link the package without issue. If an error is encountered,
NPM should not delete the entire folder contents.
### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Clone `https://github.com/JoshuaWalsh/node-ffmpeg-stream/`
  2. Clone `https://github.com/JoshuaWalsh/subtitle-indexer`
  3. In `node-ffmpeg-stream`, run `npm ci --include=prod`
  4. In `node-ffmpeg-stream`, run `npm link`
  5. In `subtitle-indexer`, run `npm link ffmpeg-stream`
  6. Observe that the `node-ffmpeg-stream` directory is now empty. (A small number of files may remain if they were in use at the time and couldn't be deleted)
### Environment:
  * OS: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19042
  * Node: 15.0.1
  * npm: 7.0.3
I am using `nvm-windows` to manage NodeJS, but currently only have one version
installed.
