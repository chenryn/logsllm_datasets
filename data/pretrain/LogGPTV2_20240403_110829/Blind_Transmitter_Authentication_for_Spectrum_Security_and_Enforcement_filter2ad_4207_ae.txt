A. SYMBOL SYNCHRONIZATION (λ)
For very large Nr, when no authentication signal is embed-
s · ejfc , where fc is the constant frequency oﬀset,
ded, λ = σ2
and  = 2πNf /Fs [33]. When FEAT is utilized to embed
the authentication signal, we could deﬁne M sets of frames
with the frequency oﬀsets fc + fk, where fc = ft + fr, and
fk = fm for m = 1, 2,··· , M . Assuming that the authenti-
cation symbols are statistically independent and identically
distributed, λ is given by

B. FRAME SYNCHRONIZATION (ψ)
For very large Nr, when no authentication signal is em-
bedded, each frame has the same frequency oﬀset and hence
the relative frequency oﬀset between consecutive frames is
zero which means ψ = σ2
s . When FEAT is utilized to embed
the authentication signal, we could deﬁne M 2 sets of relative
frequency oﬀsets between two consecutive frames—M sets
of frequency oﬀset 0, M − 1 sets of frequency oﬀset + 2fa
M−1 ,
and so on. Hence, ψ is given by

C. THEORETICAL LIMITS ON EFO (fa)
In the presence of very large number of samples present
for synchronization, the performance of the proposed syn-
chronization algorithm depends mainly on fa. From equa-
tion (5), we note that the absolute value of λ decreases by
increasing fa. This means that the probability of detection
of the peak of Λ decreases by increasing fa. Again, from
equation (6), we observe that the absolute value of ψ de-
creases by increasing fa. This means that the probability of
detection of the peak of Ψ decreases by increasing fa. On
the other hand, by increasing fa, we can enhance the error
performance of FEAT as shown in Section 5. Therefore, we
need to ﬁnd theoretical bounds on fa.
From equation (5), for M = 2, λ is given by
λ = σ2
s · ejfc · cos fa.
where  = 2πNf /Fs. Hence, the maximum value of λ is
achieved when fa = 0. This means that the synchronization
is achieved with highest accuracy when no authentication
signal is embedded into the message signal. On the other
hand, when fa = π/(2) = Fs/(4πNf ), the absolute value
of λ is 0. This means that it is diﬃcult to achieve the syn-
chronization if the EFO is close to Fs/(4πNf ). Hence, to
achieve suﬃcient level of robustness for synchronization of
the received signal and for extraction of the authentication
signal, fa needs to be suﬃciently larger than 0, but suﬃ-
ciently smaller than Fs/(4πNf ).
Moreover, in the existing standards describing PHY-layer
speciﬁcations, there is a limited margin allowed for the car-
rier frequency oﬀset (CFO) in the message signals due to
inaccurate oscillators at the transmitters and the receivers.
For instance, as per IEEE 802.11g [2], the absolute value of
CFO due to an inaccurate oscillator should be less than 25
ppm of the carrier frequency. Hence, we need to ensure that
ft + fa ≤ Fo, where Fo is the allowed frequency oﬀset as per
the standard.
