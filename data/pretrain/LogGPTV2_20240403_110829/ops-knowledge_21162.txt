I am currently encountering an issue with my Google App Engine (GAE) application, specifically when sending requests to non-default modules. Every request results in the following error message in the logs:

```
Request attempted to contact a stopped backend.
```

When I attempt to access the module directly through the browser, I receive the following error:

```
The requested URL / was not found on this server.
```

I have tried stopping and starting the "backend" modules multiple times, but the issue persists. Additionally, I changed the default version of the module to a previously working version, but the front-end requests are still being directed to the new, non-default version. Interestingly, when I try to access a previous version of the module via the browser, it works correctly.

Another symptom is that I can upload my non-default modules without any issues, but I am unable to upload the default front-end module. The deployment process repeatedly displays the message: 

```
Checking if deployment succeeded... Will check again in 60 seconds.
```

This continues even after rolling back the update. I have searched for the error message from the logs, but found very little information. Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this issue or how to resolve it?

**Solution:**
The problem was resolved by shutting down all instances across all modules and versions as a precautionary measure.
