full potential impact.
5.2 Cross Linking
Next we examine the characteristics of the cross linking
approach used by the SEO campaign to poison search re-
sults. Link “juice” is the SEO vernacular [16] for the num-
ber of back links received from other unique Web sites, a
well-known feature used by search algorithms when rank-
ing Web pages [18]. Consequentially, one of the primary
requirements for the SEO campaign to effectively poison
search results is to artiﬁcially accumulate juice. Thus, by
understanding the campaign’s cross linking strategy, we are
in a better position to counter search result poisoning.
The SEO botnet performs link farming where, using the
terminology of [7], a small subset of compromised Web
sites emulate authorities and receives substantially more
juice than the other sites emulating hubs. This relation-
ship lasts for an extended time period and ends when the
botmaster rotates authority sites, with a different subset of
compromised sites becoming authorities and receiving the
dominant fraction of juice, and previous authorities becom-
ing hubs. Link farming beneﬁts the botmaster in a couple
of ways. First, because there is a non-linear relationship be-
tween search result position and the amount of trafﬁc click-
ing through the search result, the botmaster can attract more
trafﬁc by focusing on having the authority sites occupy a
handful of top search result positions, rather than many low
search positions using all compromised sites. Second, by
selectively “juicing” a relatively small subset of authorities,
the botmaster can limit the number of sites lost due to in-
terventions by the site owner or defense mechanisms like
Google Safe Browsing.
In our study, we identiﬁed two major authority rotations
by monitoring when the amount of juice received by sites
from the botnet changes substantially. Both occur in con-
junction with major changes in the botnet. The ﬁrst rotation
occurs on November 1, 2011, when the SEO kit was up-
dated from OEM to MAC. The second rotation occurs on
January 28, 2012, when the botnet directory server experi-
enced an outage (Section 5.1.1). In both cases, it seems the
botmaster initiated the rotations because they appear related
to version changes on the control server.
Table 3 summarizes the distribution of “juice” among
compromised nodes in the botnet. It shows the number of
compromised sites, grouped by order of magnitude of the
average daily back links received by each site, for each time
period. For example, in the ﬁrst period from the beginning
of the study to November 1st, 2011, there are 532 nodes that
receive less than ten back links, 71 nodes that receive 10–
100 back links, and 12 nodes that receive 100–1000 back
links. Each time range has a consistent pattern: a small sub-
set of sites (authorities) receive hundreds of back links, tens
of sites receive tens of back links, and the remaining hubs
receive less than 10 back links. We conﬁrmed that the ac-
tual roles of compromised sites indeed changed from one
period to another. For example, in the Nov 2011 rotation
over 80 nodes had their juice reduced by at least an order of
magnitude, while 20 nodes had their juice increased by at

least an order of magnitude.
The top sites receiving the most juice are the most valu-
able to the botmaster since they have the most exposure in
search results and attract the most trafﬁc. At the same time,
because they have the most exposure they are also the most
vulnerable. To undermine SEO botnets, targeting these sites
ﬁrst will be most effective, e.g., via blacklists like Google
Safe Browsing.
As noted in Section 3, the release of V8 introduces a
new cross linking mechanism that uses blogspot blogs as an
extra layer of redirection. We do not directly compare the
amount of juice observed using this new mechanism with
the botmaster’s previous approach because there are only
two posts per blog, the last of which occurred in early April.
Since this strategy rotates juice in sporadic large batches,
rather than periodic increments, we focus the V8 cross link-
ing analysis to data after March 6, 2012. As with the pre-
vious link farming strategy, though, we see a similar distri-
bution of sites that emulate authorities (63) and hubs (665),
albeit with a larger number of middle-sized hubs (251) as
shown in Table 4.
5.3 SEO Effectiveness
Using the earlier data of the Dagger cloaking crawler,
we next examine the ability of the SEO botnet to poison
search results in Google. These poisoned search results
represent doorways, which redirect users who click through
the search result, leading to a destination of the botmaster’s
choosing. Thus, the doorways accumulate trafﬁc for the
botmaster to monetize. Therefore, we assess the potential
threat posed by the SEO botnet by measuring the poisoned
search results as seen from the user’s perspective.
We ﬁnd that the botnet can be quite effective in bursts,
with thousands of poisoned search results targeting popular,
trending search terms at any given time during the burst. At
its peak, it is the dominant contributor to poisoned search
results in Google from April through June 2011. The botnet
is able to juice speciﬁc search terms with poisoned search
results in Google within 24 hours, whereas it takes Google
over 48 hours to start to counteract the poisoning.
Figure 5: Quantity of poisoned search results at-
tributable to the SEO campaign. Each line shows
which poisoned results are redirecting users, dor-
mant, or tagged by Google Safe Browsing.
5.3.1 Quantity
Ultimately, the goal of the SEO botnet is to attract user
trafﬁc to its compromised sites by manipulating search re-
sults. We ﬁrst evaluate the effectiveness of the SEO botnet
in achieving this goal by analyzing the placement of its sites
in search results.
Using the set of compromised sites enumerated by the
host crawler, we identify the botnet’s poisoned search re-
sults using the URLs that link to a compromised site. We
then characterize each poisoned search result into one of
three states over time: active, tagged, or dormant. Active
poisoned search results are cloaking and actively redirect-
ing users. Users who click on these search results will be
taken to an unexpected site, such as fake AV, to monetize
their clicks. Tagged results have been labeled as malicious
by Google Safe Browsing (GSB) [3], presumably discour-
aging users from visiting and preventing the botmaster from
signiﬁcantly monetizing trafﬁc to these URLs. GSB black-
lists URLs that lead to phishing and malware pages. Al-
though not all pages the botnet uses to monetize trafﬁc may
fall under GSB’s purview, when GSB labels those pages
that do it is a useful indicator of defenses undermining the
botmaster’s SEO campaign. Dormant poisoned search re-
sults are cloaking but not redirecting. These search results
lead to sites that apparently have redirection disabled, and
the botmaster no longer derives value from them.
Figure 5 shows the evolution of an SEO campaign over
time as viewed by the prevalence of the various kinds of poi-
soned search results. Over six months, we saw four main
periods of activity. In a starting period, from April 1st to
April 18th, most poisoned search results were tagged yet
the volume of active remained high. On April 15th, for ex-
ample, we observed 2,807 poisoned search results, of which
1,702 search results were tagged, 721 were active, and 384

were dormant. The tagged and dormant search results are
the remnants of the previous SEO campaign by this botnet,
while the growing number of active results reﬂects increas-
ing momentum of a new campaign.
The start period transitioned into a surge period from
April 18th to April 28th, where a surge in active poisoned
search results corresponds with a decline in tagged. This
surge reﬂects the campaign promoting a new set of heav-
ily “juiced” hub sites (Section 5.2). This 10-day window
shows the botnet SEO campaign at its peak, with most
poisoned search results actively monetizing trafﬁc before
Google Safe Browsing and site owners can react.
A third steady period, from April 28th to June 30th, ex-
hibits a substantial decrease in active poisoned results and
a corresponding increase in tagged and dormant results.
These results are no longer effective for the botmaster since
they have either been ﬂagged by GSB to warn away uses or
the sites have been sanitized by their owners.
After June is an idle period where the total volume of
poisoned search results declines substantially, coinciding
with the timeframe of an organized intervention into the
fake AV industry by the FBI [8]. From July through October
2011 the SEO campaign had results linked to compromised
sites that remain tagged or dormant, but only a negligible
number of sites were actively redirecting. It highlights the
successful impact of interventions that undermine the vector
by which the botmaster could monetize trafﬁc, like the fake
AV takedown. Undermining monetization removes the key
incentive for the botmaster to keep SEO campaigns active.
5.3.2 Temporal
Section 5.3.1 assesses the SEO campaign’s activity level
over time. However, quantity alone does not give a com-
plete portrayal of the volume of poisoned search results and
their coverage in spamming speciﬁc search terms. For ex-
ample, on April 23, 2011, Dagger queried “the ten com-
mandments list” and found one poisoned search result from
this SEO campaign. Then, 16 hours after the initial query,
Dagger re-queried “the ten commandments list” and found
20 poisoned search results. We suspect the increase in poi-
soned search results is due to the increased time available
for the campaign to SEO their sites. Regardless, these dy-
namics demonstrate the importance of the time component
in conveying impact. Thus, to assess the botnet’s poten-
tial threat through volume and coverage of speciﬁc search
terms, we also measure the quantity of poisoned search re-
sults for the same query at subsequent points in time.
Recall
that Dagger repeatedly queries for the same
search terms over time to enable precisely these kinds of
temporal analyses (Section 4.2). Figure 6 presents the num-
ber of poisoned search results attributable to the SEO cam-
paign when the same query is repeated for varying time
deltas. For each search term, the zero time delta is when
Dagger ﬁrst sees poisoned search results for that search
term. We show results separately for the start, surge, and
steady periods to highlight differences among them.
Each graph contains two lines. The POISONED line rep-
resents the number of poisoned search results that have not
been labeled by Google Safe Browsing, averaged across the
entire data set. We use the same methodology as above,
except here we apply it to the additional temporal data and
we do not distinguish between active and dormant poisoned
search results. Conversely, the LABELED line represents the
average number of poisoned search results that have been
labeled by GSB. Not surprisingly, we see the same results
as before. The start period has a mixture of poisoned search
results and labeled search results from a previous SEO cam-
paign. Then there is a burst of poisoned search results dur-
ing the surge period, and a steady stream of poisoned search
results in the steady period.
The number of poisoned search results from their ﬁrst
appearance in a query for a search term is just the tip of
the iceberg. In other words, within hours of the initial ap-
pearance, users are likely to encounter a ﬂood of poisoned
search results. Although applicable for all time periods, it
is most prominent during the surge period as the number of
poisoned search results seen increases nearly 3× from 374

to 1,089 within 24 hours. In the start period, we see an in-
crease from 38 to 218 within 24 hours, and in the steady
period we see an increase from 286 to 482 within 24 hours.
Further, at the start of a new campaign GSB lags the in-
crease in poisoned search results that arrive shortly after
the initial appearance: the slope of the POISONED lines is
higher than the LABELED lines during the surge and steady
period. Only when the campaign enters the start period does
GSB begin to react swiftly to the later arriving poisoned
search results (the dip after 48 hours in the POISONED line).
5.3.3 Market Share
Intersecting the data from the botnet crawler and the search
crawler also allows us to compare the relative size of this
SEO campaign against all other similar SEO campaigns
in terms of the volume of poisoned search results. Fig-
ure 7 shows the number of cloaked search results over time
found by Dagger, and then the subset attributed to just this
SEO campaign. During the surge period, this campaign ac-
counted for the majority of cloaked search results at 58%.
This campaign was most prominent on April 24th, when
3,041 out of 4,426 (69%) poisoned search results came from
this single campaign. Even as the surge decreased in the
steady period, the SEO campaign still accounted for 17%
of all active poisoned search results observed. As a result,
not only is this SEO campaign one of the main contributors
of poisoned search results, it has demonstrated the potential
to poison more search results than all other competing SEO
campaigns combined for an extended duration of 10 days.

soned search results that actively redirect users

botnet, here we focus on active duration, the total amount
of time that the site is both exposed to users through poi-
soned search results and actively redirects them to scams.
For each compromised site we collect all occurrences of
poisoned search results to the site observed from April 1
to September 30, 2011. In addition, we track whether the
poisoned search results were redirecting users and whether
they were labeled by GSB. We use the ﬁrst occurrence of a
poisoned search result to a site as the start of the site’s active
duration. We end the active duration when we do not see an-
other occurrence of a poisoned search result, attributable to
this site, within the following three weeks of the last result.
In this six-month period, 3,822 compromised sites from
this campaign were involved in poisoning search results. Of
these, 2,128 sites (56%) actively redirected users. Figure 8
shows a binned histogram of the number of sites that poison
search results and actively redirect users at a week granu-
larity. A majority of actively redirecting sites (56%) have
durations of less than a week. Of the remaining 937 sites
that effectively poison search results and redirect users for
longer than a week, most (89%) survive 1–6 weeks.
5.4 Monetization
Ultimately, the botmaster operates and maintains the GR
botnet to make money. Compromising sites, cloaking and
trafﬁc segmentation, cross linking and poisoning search en-
gine results, etc., are all component parts of a black hat SEO
machine engineered to make a proﬁt.
5.4.1 Scams Targeted
5.3.4 Active SEO Duration
Similar to Section 5.1.2, we next quantify how long the bot-
master is able to effectively utilize compromised sites as
doorways for funneling users to scams. Compared to life-
