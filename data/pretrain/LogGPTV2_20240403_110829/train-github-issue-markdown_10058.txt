 **Migrated issue, originally created by zaazbb (@zaazbb)**
asyncio + uvloop is very fast now.
uvloop makes asyncio fast. In fact, it is at least 2x faster than nodejs,
gevent, as well as any other Python asynchronous framework. The performance of
uvloop-based asyncio is close to that of Go programs.
