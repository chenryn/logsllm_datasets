## Abstract
This study provides an in-depth analysis of 14 months of registration data to identify large-scale malicious campaigns within the .eu Top-Level Domain (TLD). We explore the ecosystem and operational methods of sophisticated cybercriminals who frequently register large numbers of domains for one-time, malicious use. Despite the short lifespan of these domains, by incorporating registrant information, we find that at least 80.04% of them can be attributed to 20 larger campaigns with varying durations and intensities. We also provide insights into the operational aspects of this activity, noting that their processes are only partially automated. Finally, we apply a post-factum clustering process to validate the campaign identification and automate the ecosystem analysis of malicious registrations in a TLD zone.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical technology enabling the expansion of the web. Virtually all web communication requires the resolution of domain names to IP addresses. Malicious activities, such as phishing, spam distribution, botnet command and control (C&C) connections, and malware distribution, rely on functioning domain names.

Widely-used domain blacklists are curated to block malicious domain names shortly after abusive activities are detected and reported. Consequently, attackers have adopted a "hit-and-run" strategy, where malicious domain names are operational for only a brief period, often just one day, before being abandoned and replaced with new ones. This approach is economically viable when the cost of registering a domain name is minimal but requires repetitive and often automated domain name registrations. We refer to these series of malicious domain names registered by a single entity as campaigns. To avoid detection, attackers use fake registration details and switch between identities, registrars, and resellers.

Additionally, underground services have emerged to facilitate bulk domain registration for abusive activities. For example, on the darknet forum "AlphaBay," services like "Domain and Email Registration as a Service" offer new domain names and private email accounts for illegal activities such as carding.

The volume of malicious domain names and the automation and monetization of the registration process highlight the need for a deep understanding of cybercriminals' modus operandi to develop effective countermeasures.

In this paper, we focus on the malicious campaign ecosystem by leveraging registrant and registration details to understand how cybercriminals acquire a constant stream of domain names. We analyze 14 months of .eu domain registrations, a top 10 ccTLD for the European Economic Area. Our dataset contains 824,121 new domain registrations, with 2.53% flagged as malicious by blacklisting services.

Key findings include:
1. 80.04% of malicious registrations are part of just 20 long-running campaigns.
2. 18.23% of malicious domains do not end up on a blacklist.
3. The malicious domain registration process is only partially automated.
4. Clustering algorithms can automate and reproduce the ecosystem analysis, with the 30 largest clusters encompassing 91.48% of blacklisted campaign registrations.

## 2. Datasets and Initial Findings
### 2.1 Registration Data
We analyzed 824,121 .eu domain registrations between April 1, 2015, and May 31, 2016. The fields inspected include:
- Basic registration information: domain name, registration date and time, and registrar.
- Contact information: company name, name, language, email address, phone, fax, and postal address.
- Nameservers or glue records, enriched with geographical location data.

### 2.2 Blacklists
To determine if a domain was used for malicious activity, we queried public blacklists daily for each new domain during the first month after registration and once more four months after the last registration. The blacklists used include:
- Spamhaus DBL (dbl.spamhaus.org)
- SURBL (multi.surbl.org)
- Google’s Safe Browsing list

### 2.3 Preliminary Insights
Analyzing the 824,121 registrations, we found that 2.53% (20,870) were flagged as malicious. Figure 1 shows the weekly share of both malicious and all registrations over the 14-month period. The correlation between the intensity of all and malicious registrations is moderate (ρ = 0.54), with the variance of malicious registrations being much larger. Most increased malicious activity, such as in February 2016, can be attributed to a single campaign.

The blacklists categorize 93.68% of the blacklisted domains as spam, 2.09% as malware infrastructure, 0.57% as unwanted software, and 3.22% as phishing. Most domains appear on blacklists within five days of registration, with 98.57% listed within the first month.

## 3. Campaign Identification Experiment
### 3.1 Campaign Identification Process
Malicious registrations often occur in batches, making high temporal concentrations a preliminary indicator of campaign activity. Figure 2 shows the daily percentage of malicious registrations, including and excluding campaign registrations. By examining the registration data within these timeframes, we identified common characteristics such as recurring values or patterns in email addresses, address info, registrars, and registrant names. We visualized correlations between registration fields to detect useful outliers, forming the basis for manually assigned campaign selection criteria. These criteria were applied to the full dataset, and if they matched multiple active days and contained a substantial number of blacklisted domains, they were considered a new campaign. This process was iteratively repeated.

### 3.2 General Campaign Observations
We identified 20 distinct campaigns, with most being long-lived. Some campaigns were active almost daily, while others had a few distinct active days. Campaigns varied in concentration, with some producing thousands of registrations over a short period and others producing fewer over a longer period. Together, the 20 campaigns cover 16,704 domain registrations, representing 80.04% of the 20,780 blacklisted registrations in our dataset. Not all campaign registrations were flagged as malicious, with 19.30% not appearing on blacklists.

### 3.3 Validation of Campaign Selection Criteria
19.30% of the registrations associated with malicious campaigns do not appear on blacklists. We expect that...
