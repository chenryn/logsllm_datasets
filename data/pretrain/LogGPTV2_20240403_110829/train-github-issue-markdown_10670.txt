It's a very common use case to want to add spacing between widgets in a `Row`
or a `Column`. At the moment, the way to do this is adding padding to each
individual element (but avoiding to do it on the first element).
It would be super useful to be able to just pass in a `spacing` value, that
would be the spacing between each widget in the row or the column.
