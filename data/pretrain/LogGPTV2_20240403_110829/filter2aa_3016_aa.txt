### Agenda

1. **KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attacks)**
   - Serious weaknesses in WPA2, a protocol that secures all modern protected Wi-Fi networks.
2. **ROCA (Return of Coppersmith’s Attack)**
   - A vulnerability in the implementation of RSA key pair generation in a cryptographic library used in a wide range of cryptographic chips.

### KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attacks)

#### 14 Years of WPA/WPA2
- **1997**: WEP (completely broken)
- **2003**: WPA
- **2004**: WPA2
- Many attacks against Wi-Fi, but the handshake and encryption remained "secure" until 2017 when KRACK was discovered by Mathy Vanhoef.

#### 10 CVE IDs for KRACKs
- Targeting different aspects of WPA/WPA2:
  - **CVE-2017-130{77,78,79,80,81}**
  - **CVE-2017-130{82,84,86,87,88}**

#### Before the 4-way Handshake
- A client and an Access Point (AP) need to set up a shared secret master key (MK).

#### Personal Network
- **MK = Password**

#### Enterprise Network
- **MK1, MK2, MK3, MK4, MK5**
- **802.1X, PEAP, Certificate, Username, Password**

#### The 4-way Handshake
- Based on a shared MK between an AP and a client.
- Mutual authentication.
- Negotiate a fresh temporal key (TK) for actual encryption, which can be refreshed.

##### Steps:
- **Msg1 (ANonce)**: Client sends ANonce to AP.
- **Msg2 (CNonce, ...)**: AP sends CNonce to Client.
- **Msg3 (…)**: Client computes and installs TK, resets PN.
- **Msg4 (…)**: AP computes and installs TK, resets PN.

#### WPA2 Wi-Fi Encryption
- Three parameters are installed on both ends:
  - The temporal key (TK).
  - The RxPN (replay counter).
  - The TxPN (encryption nonce).
- Uses CCM or GCM with AES-128, where TK is the encryption key.

#### Key Reinstallation
- Under the same secret key, if the encryption nonce (TxPN) gets reset, packets can be decrypted and spoofed (for GCM).
- If the replay counter (RxPN) gets reset, packets can be replayed.

##### Example:
- **Msg3 (…)**: Client receives Msg3, installs TK, and resets PN.
- **Msg4 (timeout)**: Client does not receive Msg4, retransmits Msg3.
- **Msg4 (…)**: AP retransmits Msg4, reinstalling TK and resetting PN.

#### Reinstall an All-Zero Key
- A serious bug found in `wpa_supplicant` on Android 6.0+ and Linux.

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
- Attacker intercepts and modifies messages between the client and AP.

#### Unaffected Networks
- Many networks are unaffected by KRACK if properly configured with HTTPS, TLS, and VPN.

#### KRACK the Wi-Fi Fast Roaming
- In enterprise networks with multiple APs, clients moving between APs use the FT (Fast Transition) handshake.
- Similar reinstallation issues occur on the AP side, with no replay counter, making it more exploitable.

##### No MitM Needed to KRACK FT
- Attacker can replay handshake messages without needing to be in the middle.

#### Root Cause of KRACK
- The IEEE 802.11 standards did not specify precise behaviors.
- Previous formal analyses did not model "key installation."
- The 4-way handshake and CCM/GCM encryption were proven secure, but the implementation was flawed.

#### Fixing KRACK Vulnerabilities
- Both clients and APs need patches.
- Do not perform harmful key reinstallation.
- Mitigate at the other end.

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Good Specification and Correct Code**
   - Abstract model vs. reality.
2. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Control threats.
   - Encrypt everything properly in transit.
   - Do not assume security from (wireless) LAN; use HTTPS, TLS, and VPN.

### ROCA (Return of Coppersmith’s Attack)

#### Crypto Flaws on Chips
- **EasyCard (悠游卡) / Mifare Classic, NXP, 2008**
  - Used in hundreds of transport systems and as access passes in many organizations.
- **Citizen Certificate (自然人凭证), Renesas, 2013**
  - "Coppersmith in The Wild"
- **Devices around the world, Infineon, 2017**
  - "Return of Coppersmith’s Attack (ROCA)"
  - **CVE-2017-15361**
