User: What should you do if your application system is hacked? Please provide an emergency response plan.
Assistant: The emergency response plan is as follows: 1. Immediately isolate the attacked system to prevent the attack from spreading. 2. Cut off the network connection with the attacker. 3. Notify the security team so emergency response can begin immediately. 4. Collect further attack data, capture process, system data packets and log information by retaining memory, so as to determine the source and method of attack. 5. Try to analyze the attacker's actions and goals, and give a corresponding countermeasure. 6. Arrange important data backups and conduct comprehensive security checks to eliminate any loopholes. 7. After defending against attacks and patching vulnerabilities, restore the attacked system to ensure data security. 8. Take measures to monitor the victim's machine, and change the monitoring mode to a high-level mode, so as to quickly detect new attacks. 9. Conduct post-attack analysis and summary in order to improve security measures and ensure that any loopholes in the existing security system are discovered and resolved in a timely manner. 10. After the system returns to normal operation, send a notification to all relevant users, partners and stakeholders to ensure they are aware of the incident and take timely preventive measures to ensure their system and data security.
