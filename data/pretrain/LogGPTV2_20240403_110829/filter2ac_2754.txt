### Title: US-19 HostSplit: Exploitable Antipatterns in Unicode Normalization

This presentation introduces new exploit techniques that leverage Unicode normalization to bypass URL security filters and, in some cases, allow one domain to impersonate another. Unlike previous attacks on internationalized domain names (IDNs), which relied on visual spoofing, these new attacks deceive software by using URL strings that are parsed as belonging to one hostname but resolved as a different one.

The vulnerabilities enabling these attacks are widespread, primarily due to practical compromises in the implementation of IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names for Applications) standards. The presenter has identified several new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to these issues, including vulnerabilities in Edge/IE, .NET, Python, Java, Office 365, and Gmail. Additionally, the talk will cover a more general exploit pattern targeting OAuth.

While some platform-level issues have already been addressed, many of the necessary fixes will need to be implemented at the application level. It is likely that numerous software packages still contain Unicode normalization vulnerabilities of this type. This presentation will discuss methods for testing these vulnerabilities and provide coding and design best practices to prevent them.
