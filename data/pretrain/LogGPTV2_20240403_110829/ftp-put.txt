**Applies to:**

**Description:**
The `put` command copies a local file to the remote computer using the current file transfer type. This command is functionally equivalent to the `ftp send` command.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
put <localfile> [<remotefile>]
```

**Parameters:**

- **<localfile>**: Specifies the local file that you want to copy to the remote computer.
- **[<remotefile>]**: (Optional) Specifies the name to be used on the remote computer. If this parameter is not provided, the file will retain its original local filename.

**Examples:**

1. To copy the local file `test.txt` and name it `test1.txt` on the remote computer, use the following command:
   ```plaintext
   put test.txt test1.txt
   ```

2. To copy the local file `program.exe` to the remote computer, retaining the same filename, use the following command:
   ```plaintext
   put program.exe
   ```

This command is useful for transferring files from your local machine to a remote server using FTP.
