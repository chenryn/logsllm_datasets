User: I'm trying to get the output from a batch file LIVE as it runs. I would prefer the console of the batch file to also show as it runs. I have tried using os.popen and subprocess.Popen but the problem is that it does not run the program LIVE in the background and constantly show what is being printed to the console.
Exactly what I want, is to have a string that is constantly updated with the data from the console of the running batch file.
Assistant: Can't you just use os.system?
