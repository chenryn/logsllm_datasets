for each k ∈ [q], Gamek,1 and Gamek,2 are computationally
indistinguishable.
Proof. Suppose there exists an adversary A that distin-
guishes Gamek,1 and Gamek,2. Then we can build an algo-
rithm B with non-negligible advantage in breaking Assump-
tion 1. B is given G, GT , e, N, g, X1X2, Y2Y3, X3, T and will
simulate Gamek,1 or Gamek,2 with A. B chooses α, a0, a1, . . .,
an ∈ ZN uniformly at random. It then sets h0 = ga0 , h1 =
ga1 , . . . , hn = gan , and sends A the public parameters:
PK = (G, GT , e, N, g, h0, h1, . . . , hn, e(g, g)α).
The responses to all key queries and challenge ciphertexts
are the same as in Lemma 3, except that the k-th key query
which is given below.
To answer the k-th key quest for (A, ρ,T = (tρ(1), . . .,
N such that v · 1 =
tρ(ℓ))), B chooses a random vector v ∈ Zm

5Notice that, We have already assumed that the same value
never appears in two distinct attribute categories and each
attribute name/category can only be used once in an access
structure. That is, for each i1, i2 ∈ [n] and j1, j2 ∈ [ℓ], if
i1 ̸= i2, j1 ̸= j2, then zi1
̸= zi2 and tρ(j1) ̸= tρ(j2).

Lemma 5. Suppose that G satis(cid:12)es Assumption 3. Then
Gameq,2 and GameFinal are computationally indistinguishable.
Proof. Suppose there exists an adversary A that distin-
guishes Gameq,2 and GameFinal. Then we can build an al-
gorithm B with non-negligible advantage in breaking As-
sumption 3. B is given (G, GT , N, e, g, g2, gαX2, gsY2, X3, T )
and will simulate Gameq,2 or GameFinal with A. B chooses
a0, a1, . . . , an ∈ ZN uniformly at random. It then sets h0 =
ga0 , h1 = ga1 , . . . , hn = gan , and sends A the public param-
eters:
PK = (G, GT , e, N, g, h0, h1, . . . , hn, e(gαX2, g) = e(g, g)α).
Each time B is asked to provide a secret key for an access
structure A = (A, ρ, T ), where A is an ℓ × m matrix, ρ
is a map from each row Ai of A to {1, . . . , n} and T =
(tρ(1), . . . , tρ(ℓ)) ∈ Zℓ

At some point, A sends B two (equal length) messages
M0, M1 and a set of attributes S. B chooses β ∈ {0, 1}
randomly and does the following.

where η = a0 +

modulo p1 are uncorrelated to their values modulo p2. Hence,
if T = e(g, g)αs, then CT is a properly distributed semi-
functional ciphertext of Mβ. On the other hand, if T ← GT ,
then CT is a properly distributed semi-functional ciphertext
of a random message.
We can conclude that, if T = e(g, g)αs, then B has prop-
erly simulated Gameq,2. If T ← GT , then B has properly
simulated GameFinal. Hence, B can use the output of A to
distinguish between these possibilities for T .
4. CONCLUSIONS
We presented the ﬁrst KP-ABE scheme, which has the
following features simultaneously: expressive (i.e., support-
ing arbitrary monotonic access structure); fully secure in the
standard model; constant-size ciphertexts and fast decryp-
tion.
In the future, it will be interesting to see if shorter
secret keys can be obtained without aﬀecting the other fea-
tures of our proposed scheme. Another challenging problem
is to design CP-ABE schemes with the similar features of
our proposed KP-ABE scheme.
