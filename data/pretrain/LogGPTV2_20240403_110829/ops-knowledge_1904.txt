Assistant: For system monitoring and performance analysis, the following steps can be taken: 1. Select the appropriate monitoring tool: According to the actual situation and needs, select the appropriate system monitoring tool, such as Zabbix, Nagios, Grafana, etc., or the monitoring service provided by the cloud service provider. 2. Monitoring system key indicators: set monitoring items, monitor system key indicators, including CPU, memory, network, disk, process, log, etc. When encountering a problem, locate the location and cause of the problem in time. 3. Perform performance analysis: analyze monitoring data, regularly evaluate system performance and capacity, and improve system performance and stability by adjusting configuration and optimizing code. 4. Find and solve problems in time: When a performance problem is found in the system, take immediate measures to locate and solve the problem. You can use various tools, such as performance analyzers, memory leak detection tools, and so on. 5. Real-time monitoring system status: With the continuous development and upgrading of the system, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the monitoring, analysis and optimization of the system. Real-time monitoring of system status, timely detection of problems, avoiding problem expansion, and ensuring high availability and stability of the system.
