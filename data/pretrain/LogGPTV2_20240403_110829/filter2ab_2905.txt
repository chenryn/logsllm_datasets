**Description:**
Configuring per-app Virtual Private Network (VPN) policies, rather than device-wide VPN settings, can effectively restrict access to internal enterprise resources via the VPN to only those applications that have been approved by the enterprise. This approach enhances security by ensuring that only trusted and authorized applications can connect to sensitive corporate networks, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
