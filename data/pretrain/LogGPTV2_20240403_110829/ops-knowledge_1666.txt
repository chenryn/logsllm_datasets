User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题NRPE unable to read output, but why? I have this problem with NRPE, all the stuff I've found so far on the net seems to point me at things I've already tried.

# /usr/local/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H nrpeclient


gives

NRPE v2.12


as expected.

Running the command by hand (as defined in nrpe.cfg on "nrpeclient", gives the expected response

nrpe.cfg:

command[check_openmanage]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/additional/check_openmanage -s -e   -b ctrl_driver=0 bat_charge

"Expected response"


But if I try to run the command from the Nagios server I get the following:

# /usr/local/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H comxps -c check_openmanage
NRPE: Unable to read output


Can anyone think of anywhere else I might have made a mistake with this? I've done the same thing on multiple other servers with no problem. The only difference I can think of with this is that this box is RHEL 5 based, whereas the others are RHEL 4 based.

Those two bits above that I've tested are the what most people seem to suggest when people have had this problem.

I should mention that I get a weird error in the logs when I restart nrpe:

nrpe[14534]: Unable to open config file '/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg' for reading 
nrpe[14534]: Continuing with errors...
nrpe[14535]: Starting up daemon
nrpe[14535]: Warning: Daemon is configured to accept command arguments from clients!
nrpe[14535]: Listening for connections on port 5666 
nrpe[14535]: Allowing connections from: bodbck,combck,nam-bck


Even though, it's plainly reading that /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg file to get the stuff it's talking about further down..

Assistant: You have a rights problem.

Change the command to:

command[check_openmanage]=sudo /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/additional/check_openmanage -s -e -b ctrl_driver=0 bat_charge


(add sudo)

Then, add the nagios-user to the sudoers:

nagios ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/additional/check_openmanage


Or you could just chmod the file... That also works.

If you are using CentOS, Red Hat, Scientific or Fedora, make sure to disable Defaults requiretty in the sudoers file.
