TABLE XI: Top 15 ASes covering 33.6% of all detected sub-allocations. The AS Rank represents the AS reputation collected through BGP
Ranking [6], the higher the number the more malicious activities are observed. The “coverage” column represents the ratio of detected sub-
allocations found in the AS out of all detected sub-allocations while the ratio in parenthesis indicates the ratio out of the ASes’s overall size.
“DC” & “HP” stand for Data Center and Hosting Provider respectively.

tion III-D. Overall, 12K sub-allocations did not have corre-
sponding owner objects indicating they are managed by the
same party managing the parent network block. In other words,
these sub-allocations were not managed by a 3rd party. 28K
of the detected sub-allocations had 19K corresponding owner
objects. Table XIII lists the top 15 owners objects managing the
detected sub-allocations. Not all owner objects are resellers,
some are businesses and private customers. Almost 50% (10K)
of our collected owner objects are private customers without
any contact information other than a customer name. Auto-
matically labeling resellers is difﬁcult as they exhibit the same
features as other customers and business. For the purposes
of the data provided in Table XIII, we manually visited the
websites of the owners to determine if they are likely to be
resellers.
Reincarnation & recycling. The process of owner object
generation enables us to capture owners reincarnations where
many resellers span multiple service providers and even
registries. Furthermore, once certain owners are blocked by
a service provider, they simply register with another using
similar contact information enabling us to link them. As shown
in Table XIII, we found a number of owners spanning ASes
(i.e. service providers) and even registries. We also ﬁnd an
overwhelming number of Whois objects (e.g. organizations and
persons) per owner, with an average of 8 objects, making it
more difﬁcult to blacklist their Whois objects.
Additionally, we ﬁnd owners repeatedly registering and
dropping sub-allocations in much the same way as the service
providers explained in Section V-A. Calculating the recycling
rate per owner object, we ﬁnd a different distribution of objects
with quite a high rate of recycling, some are as high as 7%,
shown in Table XIV. Figure 13 illustrates the daily churn
Fig. 13: Recycling behavior of the top 5 Owners showing the daily
number of network blocks registered and dropped. An acronym
represents a name given to the owner object, as in Table XIV. For
example,“HV” stands for Hudson Valley Host.
This behavior causes “ColoCrossing” and its parent company
“Velocity Servers” to not be detected by our classiﬁer and other
AS based reputation metrics 10. We found similar re-branding
and AS creation patterns by “Ecatel” and “Quasi Networks”
but did not speciﬁcally interact with them to gain a deeper
understanding of their structure.
B. Sub-allocation Owners
Overview. In order to capture the malicious actors and re-
sellers managing the detected sub-allocations, we analyze the
owner objects generated by the process described in Sec-
10It is unclear if this activity is intentionally evading reputation metrics or
if it is benign.
