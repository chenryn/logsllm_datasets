### Section III-D: Sub-allocation Analysis

Overall, 12,000 sub-allocations did not have corresponding owner objects, indicating they are managed by the same party managing the parent network block. In other words, these sub-allocations were not managed by a third party. 28,000 of the detected sub-allocations had 19,000 corresponding owner objects. Table XIII lists the top 15 owners managing the detected sub-allocations. Not all owner objects are resellers; some are businesses and private customers. Almost 50% (10,000) of the collected owner objects are private customers without any contact information other than a customer name. Automatically labeling resellers is difficult as they exhibit the same features as other customers and businesses. For the purposes of the data provided in Table XIII, we manually visited the websites of the owners to determine if they are likely to be resellers.

### Reincarnation and Recycling

The process of owner object generation enables us to capture owner reincarnations, where many resellers span multiple service providers and even registries. Furthermore, once certain owners are blocked by a service provider, they simply register with another using similar contact information, enabling us to link them. As shown in Table XIII, we found a number of owners spanning ASes (i.e., service providers) and even registries. We also find an overwhelming number of Whois objects (e.g., organizations and persons) per owner, with an average of 8 objects, making it more difficult to blacklist their Whois objects.

Additionally, we find owners repeatedly registering and dropping sub-allocations in much the same way as the service providers explained in Section V-A. Calculating the recycling rate per owner object, we find a different distribution of objects with quite a high rate of recycling, some as high as 7%, shown in Table XIV. Figure 13 illustrates the daily churn of the top 5 owners showing the daily number of network blocks registered and dropped. An acronym represents a name given to the owner object, as in Table XIV. For example, "HV" stands for Hudson Valley Host.

This behavior causes "ColoCrossing" and its parent company "Velocity Servers" to not be detected by our classifier and other AS-based reputation metrics. We found similar re-branding and AS creation patterns by "Ecatel" and "Quasi Networks" but did not specifically interact with them to gain a deeper understanding of their structure.

### B. Sub-allocation Owners

#### Overview

To capture the malicious actors and resellers managing the detected sub-allocations, we analyze the owner objects generated by the process described in Section III-D.

### Recycling Behavior

Of note is the recycling behavior of a subsidiary of "ColoCrossing," "Hudson Valley Host," with a significant recycling rate. This behavior contributes to the challenges in detecting and blocking malicious activities.
