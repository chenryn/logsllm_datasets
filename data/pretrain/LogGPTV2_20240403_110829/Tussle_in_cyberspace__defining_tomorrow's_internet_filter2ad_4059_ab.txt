ternet, by allowing for competition among algorithms, im-
plementations, and vendors, and by enabling rapid techni-
cal progress through replacement of modular parts rather
than entire systems. But open interfaces also allow choice,
not just replacement. If a protocol allows a party to select
among alternative providers of service, this usually implies
that the interface to that service is well-deﬁned, so that in-
dependent versions of the service can be constructed.
Tussles often happen across interfaces. Some tussles
involve the use of diﬀerent mechanisms by diﬀerent parties.
However, some tussles, such as the tussle among compet-
itive ISPs, may involve technical interfaces between those
parties. For example, BGP is used as the routing protocol
among ISPs, who interconnect but are business competitors.
If an interface occurs at a point of tussle, it will have diﬀer-
ent attributes from an interface that exists simply to foster
interoperability, modularity, or competition among suppli-
ers.
Open interfaces at tussle points may beneﬁt from the fol-
lowing sorts of properties, which are not always important
in other cases.
• Visible exchange of value.
• Exposure of cost of choice.
• Visibility (or not) of choices made.
• Tools to resolve and isolate faults and failures.
It matters if the consequence of choice is visible.
Choices made in public are sometimes diﬀerent than those
made in secret.
In some cases, there is no way to hide a
choice. Often, the choice can be secret, even if its conse-
quences are visible. The routing arrangements among ISPs
are generally not public, even though everyone can see the
consequences at the BGP level. A link-state routing pro-
tocol requires that everyone export his link costs, while a
distance vector protocol makes it harder to see what the
internal choices are.
Tussles have diﬀerent ﬂavors. In some cases, the in-
terests of the players are simply adverse, and there is no
win-win way to balance them. But in many cases, players’
interests are not adverse, but simply diﬀerent. A user wants
to send data; a provider wants to be compensated for car-
rying it. While this implies a natural tussle over pricing, in
the end both parties realize that they must meet the other’s
needs.
To support this class of tussle, recognize that there is often
an exchange of value for service. Value need not be “money”
but often will be. Napster is a non-monetary example that
illustrates the “mutual aid” aspect of peer-to-peer network-
ing. Whatever the compensation, recognize that it must
ﬂow, just as much as data must ﬂow. Sometimes this hap-
pens outside the system, sometimes within a protocol.
If
this “value ﬂow” requires a protocol, design it. (There is an
interesting case study in the rise and fall of micro-payments,
the success of the traditional credit card companies for In-
ternet payments, and the emergence of PayPal and similar
schemes.)
Tussles evolve over time. A traditional engineering
design produces a result that is constant until the mecha-
nism is redesigned. But tussle is ongoing and evolutionary.
349Each side ﬁnds new ways to gain an advantage, and then
the other side responds. This implies, ﬁrst, that any think-
ing about tussle must view it as a multi-round process, and
second, that as mechanism is drawn into an ongoing tussle,
it may be used in unexpected ways, and require redesign to
survive in this new role.
There is no such thing as value-neutral design.
What choices designers include or exclude, what interfaces
are deﬁned or not, what protocols are open or proprietary,
can have a profound inﬂuence on the shape of the Internet,
the motivations of the players, and the potential for distor-
tion of the architecture.
Don’t assume that you design the answer. You are
designing a playing ﬁeld, not the outcome.
3. TUSSLE SPACES
In this section we discuss some speciﬁc aspects of the In-
ternet in which diﬀerent players with competing interests
come together. In each case, our goal is to examine the na-
ture of the tussle and to illustrate how our principles can be
applied in speciﬁc cases. We suggest some speciﬁc research
areas that would beneﬁt from application of our principles.
3.1 Economics
One of the tussles that deﬁne the current Internet is the
tussle of economics. The providers of the Internet are not in
the business of giving service away. For most, it is a business,
run to make a proﬁt. This means they are competitors, and
look at the user, and each other, as a customer and a source
of revenue. Providers tussle as they compete, and consumers
tussle with providers to get the service they want at a low
price.2
How can we, as engineers, shape the economic tussle? In
fact, we have great power to shape this tussle, but ﬁrst we
have to understand the rules that deﬁne it. A standard
business saying is that the drivers of investment are fear
and greed. Greed is easy to understand—it drove hundreds
of billions of dollars worth of investment in telecommunica-
tions over the last decade, much of which now sits at risk of
bankruptcy. But fear is more subtle. The vector of fear is
competition, which results when the consumer has choice.
The tussle among providers and consumers in a competitive
landscape is the most basic attribute of a marketplace. Most
economists of a “western” bent would argue that competi-
tion is good:
it drives innovation, disciplines the market,
insures eﬃciency, and removes the need for intervention and
regulation of a market. To make competition viable, the
consumer in a market must have the ability to choose. So
our principle that one should design choice into mechanism
is the building block of competition.
Here are some speciﬁc examples, with implications for re-
search and network design:
3.1.1 Provider lock-in from IP addressing
2There is now considerable interest in the economics com-
munity in the nature of the Internet. Some of the seminal
papers are published in [9]. For an overview of the current
literature on Internet economics, see the Web site main-
tained by Mackie-Mason at http://china.si.umich.edu/
telecom/net-economics.html.
ISPs would like to ﬁnd ways to lock in their customers;
customers want to preserve the ability to change among
providers. This illustrates the basic consumer-producer tus-
sle in a competitive world. For hosts that use static ad-
dresses, renumbering is a complex task. Because renum-
bering hosts can be hard, there is a very explicit tension
today between the desire to have addresses reﬂect topology
to support eﬃcient routing and the desire of the customer to
change providers easily. Either a customer is locked into his
provider by the provider-based addresses, or they obtain a
separate block of addresses that are not topologically signif-
icant and therefore add to the size of the forwarding tables
in the core of the network. Many ISP’s refuse to route small
address blocks, nominally protecting the routing tables but
also locking the customer to their address range. The re-
sponses by the consumer include dynamic host numbering
(DHCP) and dynamic update of DNS entries when the host
is renumbered.
• A desire for vigorous competition would suggest that
the consumer should have the choice to move from ISP
to ISP. Given that, the Internet design should incorpo-
rate mechanisms that make it easy for a host to change
addresses and to have and use multiple addresses.
Addresses should reﬂect connectivity, not identity, to
modularize tussle. This would relieve problems with
end-node mobility, improve choice in multi-homed ma-
chines, and improve the ease of changing providers.
3.1.2 Value pricing
One of the standard ways to improve revenues is to ﬁnd
ways to divide customers into classes based on their willing-
ness to pay, and charge them accordingly—what economists
call value pricing. An example from another sector is the
“Saturday night stay” criterion for airline travel.
It costs
the airline no more to carry a passenger if she does not stay
over Saturday night, but this restriction tends to separate
the business and pleasure traveler, which is useful because
the business traveler seems to have a greater willingness to
pay. Airlines impose Saturday night stay restrictions, and
consumers respond by buying multiple tickets, and using
only some of the segments of the ﬂight. Airlines respond by
declaring this behavior unacceptable. And thus the tussle
evolves.
As an example of similar behavior in the Internet, some
acceptable use policies for residential broadband access pro-
hibit the operation of a server in the home. To run a server,
the customer is required to pay a higher “business” rate.
Customers who wish to sidestep this restriction can respond
by shifting to another provider, if there is one, or by tunnel-
ing to disguise the port numbers being used. The probable
outcome of this tussle depends strongly on whether one per-
ceives competition as currently healthy in the Internet, or
eroding to dangerous levels.
• This discussion illustrates the observation that there
may be no such thing as value-neutral design. The de-
sign and deployment of tunnels (or other mechanisms
to mask what services are being used by a consumer)
shifts the balance of power from the producer to the
consumer. Given that value pricing is not a moral
wrong, should the consumers be aided in their quest
to bypass the controls of the producers? Those who
350see the consumer as “the little guy” being abused by
the “big providers” will design such mechanisms, and
this is part of the tussle, not something that happens
outside the tussle. What mechanisms get designed,
and what standards get approved, are all part of the
tussle.
3.1.3 Residential broadband access
There is concern today that the advent of broadband res-
idential access will be accompanied by a great reduction in
competition. Today there are almost 6000 dialup Internet
service providers. A pessimistic outcome ﬁve years in the
future is that the average residential customer will have two
choices—his telephone company and his cable company, be-
cause they control the wires. This loss of choice and compe-
tition is viewed with great alarm by many, who fear that it
may lead to higher prices and restrictions on what the user
may do, and there are many forces aligning to ﬁght this
loss of competition. Some are regulatory, calling for laws to
mandate “open access”, to force the owners of the wires to
allow multiple ISPs to use them. Economists and regulators
hope that multiple providers will install their own cables, to
increase competition.3 However, in a tussle of competition,
one cannot compel a potential provider to invest and enter
a market.
Using the principles of this paper, one should speculate
on what sorts of investments are actually likely to be made,
and to think about what choice, and what tussle modular-
ity, would improve the outcome of such an investment. One
investment option that is gaining momentum now is munic-
ipal deployment of ﬁber, because ﬁber installed by a neutral
party such as a municipality can be a platform for competi-
tors to provide higher level services (e.g. phone, Internet
or television). This requires that the equipment lighting
the ﬁber support multiple service providers. Most of the
equipment made today is not “naturally open” in this way,
having been designed without consideration of this particu-
lar modularity boundary (or indeed with the speciﬁc goal of
confounding it).
• An important R&D project is to design and demon-
strate a ﬁber-based residential access facility that sup-
ports competition in higher-level services. Technical
questions include whether sharing should be in the
time domain (packets) or color domain, how the fair-
ness of sharing can be enforced and veriﬁed, an ap-
proach to fault isolation and other operational issues,
and how incremental upgrades can be done. This pro-
ject is motivated both by the principle of “design for
choice”, and as well by recognition of new tussle bound-
aries.
Most of today’s “open access” proposals fail to balance
the interests of concerned parties because they are not mod-
ularized along tussle space boundaries. For example, the
capital costs and deployment pragmatics of broadband in-
frastructure diﬀer greatly from those of operating mail and
web servers. This creates a natural boundary between the
two tussle spaces of broadband facilities provision and ISP
services. Proposals that implement open access at this mod-
ularity boundary are more likely to beneﬁt the Internet as a

whole, because they allow each tussle to play out indepen-
dently.
3.1.4 Competitive wide area access
Today, the Internet system does not let the individual cus-
tomer select his “long distance provider” the way the tele-
phone system does. This is an example of designers failing
to appreciate a competitive tussle space.
At the time that equal access was being introduced into
the telephone system, there was a call for Internet routing to
support the same capability. The Internet designers deemed
this not necessary. They reasoned that there would be suf-
ﬁcient competition in the market because there were going
to be many ISP’s directly competing to serve the customer.
Letting the local provider enter into a wholesale arrange-
ment to obtain wide area service seemed adequate, because
if one local provider made an unsatisfactory choice in wide
area provider, the customer could just switch to a new local
provider.
But this decision may be having undesirable consequences
today. It is possible that customers today would be much
more likely to see more service diversity, e.g. quality of
service support for applications, if there were more compe-
tition.
• The Internet should support a mechanism for choice of
source routing that would permit a customer to con-
trol the path of his packets at the level of providers.
A design for such a system must include where these
user-selected routes come from or how they are con-
structed, how failures are managed, and how the user
knows that the traﬃc actually took the desired route.
The capability must also be approachable by a broad
class of users of varying sophistication. This is a very
complex design challenge,4 but could have a great in-
ﬂuence.
This example illustrates another important point about
competition. One should be prepared to pay for what one
uses, or there is little incentive for a provider to oﬀer it. To-
day, service providers do not like loose source, because ISPs
don’t receive any beneﬁt when they carry traﬃc directed by
a source route. ISPs enter into business arrangement that
determine which traﬃc they agree to carry across which in-
