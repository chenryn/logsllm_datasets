Tracking issue, base on a idea of @htcfreek from pull request #6975:
## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
It would be nice to see the name of a color direct in the color picker
  1. Show the color name in the color picker window
  2. Add a option to copy the color name instead of the color presentation (when there is a color name)
  3. (optional) When there is no color name, show a color name that is in the near (like a diff of 2% or so)
