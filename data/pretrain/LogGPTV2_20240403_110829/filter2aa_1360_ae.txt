You will receive a warning about making changes within this area, but the modifications we make will be safe. 
Choose to accept the risks. Some of these aboutxonfig settings may already be on the correct setting, but most 
probably will not To change most of these settings you can simply double-click the setting to toggle it between 
"True" and "False". Some may require additional input, such as a number. Because the list of aboutxonfig 
settings contains hundreds of entries, you should search for all of these through the search bar in the 
aboutxonfig tab. The settings in the following examples are desired options. You would want the first example 
to be changed to FALSE.
• 
Uncheck the box titled "Remember search and form history".
• 
Check the box titled "Clear history when Firefox closes".
• 
Do NOT check the box titled "Always use private browsing mode", as 
Containers.
• 
Uncheck "Browsing history" from the "Address Bar" menu.
• 
In the "Permissions" menu, click "Settings" next to Location, Camera, Microphone, and Notifications. 
Check the box tided "Block new requests..." for each of these options.
• 
Uncheck all options under "Firefox Data Collection and Use".
• 
Uncheck all options under "Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection". This will prevent 
Firefox from sharing potential malicious site visits with third-party services. This leaves you more 
exposed to undesired software attacks, but protects your internet history from being shared with 
Google.
• 
Enable "HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows".
Firefox allows users to modify many configuration settings, and some of these deal with privacy and security 
concerns. Though some of these changes can be made in the menu of Firefox’s preferences, changes made 
through aboutxonfig tend to be more durable and granular. To access the list of configuration settings, open 
Firefox and type "aboutxonfig" into the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) field. This is the place where you 
would traditionally type the website you wish to visit The terms URL, web address, and website will be used 
interchangeably throughout the book.

It is not vital that all of these security settings be applied to your systems. Firefox natively respects your privacy 
and security more than other browsers. These recommendations are for those that want to tweak additional 
settings that may provide a new layer of protection, even if minimal. Next, I will discuss the biggest benefit of 
Firefox, which is the abundance of helpful browser extensions called add-ons.
There are thousands of extensions available for Firefox. Some are helpful, some are worthless, and some are 
fun. This chapter will discuss several of them. The Firefox add-ons, sometimes called extensions, detailed here 
will include a website for each option. You can either visit the website and download the add-on, or search for 
it from within Firefox. The latter is usually the easiest way. While Firefox is open, click on the menu in the upper 
right and then "Add-ons". This will present a page with a search field in the upper right comer. Enter the name 
of the extension and install from there. The following are my recommendations, in order of importance.
The following pages provide explicit instructions for installing and configuring each of these add-ons. At the 
end, 1 will explain how you can export your settings and replicate your work across practically any Firefox 
installation. This will preserve your work and allow you to receive an identical experience if conducting 
investigations across multiple computers. This will also benefit your virtual machines. Ideally, you would 
complete all browser configurations within your original VM before cloning, exporting, or use of snapshots.
WebRTC: These settings address a potential vulnerability of leaked IP addresses. If you use audio or video 
communications within your browser, such as virtual conferencing software, these could break those sendees 
and should be ignored. If you are protected within a home network VPN, as explained later, these are not vital 
changes.

On my machine, I have the following containers, which can be seen
The first Firefox Add-on which I use daily is the Multi-Account Containers option from Mozilla. Multi-Account 
Containers allows you to separate your various types of browsing without needing to clear your history, log in 
and out, or use multiple browsers. These container tabs are like normal tabs, except the sites you visit will have 
access to a separate slice of the browser's storage. This means your site preferences, logged-in sessions, and 
advertising tracking data will not carry over to the new container. Likewise, any browsing you do within the new 
container will not affect your logged in sessions, or tracking data of your other containers. Below is an example.
On my personal laptop, I have a container tab open which I use to log in to my email provider. I have my inbox 
open in this tab. I want to order a product from Amazon, but I do not want them to see any cookies stored by 
my email provider. I also want to conduct a Google search, but do not want Google to see any data present 
from my Amazon search. I simply open a unique container tab for each of these events. Each sees the session 
as unique, and no data is shared from one service to another.
Once installed, you will see a new icon in the upper right in your Firefox browser which appears as three squares 
and a "+" character. Click on it and select the container you want to open. Default options include choices such 
as Personal and Shopping, but you can modify these any way you desire. You can create, delete, and edit 
containers from the main menu. When you click the "Manage Containers" option, you can change the color or 
icon associated with a container or change the container name. The following tutorial replicates my configuration 
for OS1NT investigations.
OSINT investigators can use this technique in many ways. With a traditional browser, you can only be logged 
in to one instance of a social network. If you are logged in to a coven Facebook account, then open a new tab 
and navigate to Facebook, you will be presented with the same logged-in account used in the previous tab. With 
containers, we can isolate this activity. You can log in to one Facebook account in one container, another 
Facebook account in a second container, and any additional accounts in their own containers. This applies to 
any sendee, such as Twitter, Reddit, or others. This allows us to simultaneously access multiple accounts within 
the same sendee without logging out or opening a different browser. This is a substantial update from previous 
editions. Let's configure it for optimal use.
• 
Open the Multi-Account Containers menu and click the "Manage Containers" option.
• 
Delete all containers by selecting each and clicking "Delete This Container".
• 
In the "Manage Containers" menu, click the + in the upper left.
• 
Enter the name of your new container, such as "Alias 01".
• 
Choose a desired color and icon.
• 
Repeat this process to create the number of containers desired.
You can now either open a new container as a blank page or open links in a new or different container. The 
following are a few of my usage examples.

Multiple Logins: While in Firefox, I want to open Facebook inside a unique container. I click on the containers 
menu and select Alias 01. This opens a new blank tab within this container. I navigate to Facebook and log in 
to an alias account. 1 then want to log in to a second Facebook account, so 1 click on the containers menu and 
select Alias 02. This opens a new tab in that container. 1 then navigate to Facebook and receive a login prompt. 
I log in to my second account and can switch back and forth between tabs. You should note that Facebook can 
see you have the same IP address for each login, but they cannot see your cookies from one session to the other. 
You could replicate this process for any other social network or service. You could also have numerous Gmail 
accounts open within one browser.
When I first installed this add-on, I went a bit too far with customized containers. I wanted all Facebook pages 
to load in their own container, which prevented the ability to log in to multiple accounts. I removed this option 
and established the rule mentioned previously which allowed me to have multiple logins, but lost the isolation 
from Facebook to other websites. I created containers for most of the sites 1 visited, which was overkill. There 
is no perfect solution. Evaluate your needs and create the most appropriate set of containers vital to your 
investigation. If you want to isolate a container to only open designated sites, click "Manage Containers"; select 
the desired container; and enable the "Limit to Designated Sites" option, which is visible in Figure 3.01 (right). 
This prevents accidental openings of undesired sites within a secure container. On my personal laptop, my 
containers are focused on privacy and isolate invasive services such as Amazon, Google, and online payment 
services. 1 also isolate financial websites and personal email tabs. 1 highly recommend applying these same 
strategies to your personal devices. I possess the following containers on my personal laptop.
When complete, you have created a rule within Firefox. Any time you connect to google.com, regardless of the 
container you are in, or if you have Google set as your default search from within the URL field, Firefox will 
open a new "Google" tab to complete your connection. This isolates your Google traffic from any other tab, 
and applies to any Google sites, such as Google Voice, Gmail, etc. If you regret making this type of rule, you 
can either delete the entire container or just the policy for that site. In this example, I can go to the Containers 
menu; click the "Manage Containers" option; then select the Google container; then click the delete option.
Dedicated Container: I assign specific websites to a container so they will always open in that container. I use 
this for Google because I do not want my search history associated with other investigation activities. If I ever 
visit Google as part of an investigation, the site will open in a new container tab which I designated "Google". 
This is regardless of which tab I try to use. The following steps configure this option.
Safety: While I am viewing my target's Twitter profile, I see a link to an external website from his page. I am 
logged in to a Twitter account within this container and I do not know what this linked website will try to load. 
I do not want to jeopardize my investigation. I right-click on the link and choose "Open link in New Container", 
and then select the desired container tab, such as "Harmful". The new tab will open within this container created 
for questionable websites. The page I open cannot see any cookies stored within my container associated with 
my Twitter login.

can take it a step further.
Figure 3.01: The Firefox Multi-Account Containers menus.
After you have enabled the Advanced settings as explained above, clicking on the uBlock Origin icon should 
now present an expanded menu which will change as you visit different sites. In order to explain the function 
of this menu, I will conduct a demonstration using the website cnn.com. Figure 3.02 displays the default view 
of uBlock Origin with the site loaded. While this book is printed in black and white, your view will be in color, 
and likely all options will appear grey. Scrolling down this list of scripts that have either been loaded or blocked, 
you can see several questionable scripts such as Twitter, Amazon, and Turner. These scripts allow tracking 
across multiple websites and are the technolog}’ responsible for monitoring your interests, web history, and 
shopping habits.
This menu is split into three columns. The first simply identifies the type of code or domain name 
The second column is global settings. Anything changed here will apply to all website visits. The third column 
contains settings for the current website. A single plus sign (+) indicates that less than ten scripts were allowed
Click on the uBlock Origin icon in the menu and select the "Dashboard" icon to the right, which appears as a 
settings option. This will open a new tab with the program's configuration page. On the "Settings" tab, click the 
option of "I am an advanced user". This will present an expanded menu from die uBlock Origin icon from now 
forward. Click on the "Filters" tab and consider enabling additional data sets that may protect your computer. I 
find the default lists sufficient, however I enable "Block access to LAN" under "Privacy". You now have 
extended protection that will be applied to all visited websites without any interaction from you. When you 
encounter a web page with a lot of advertisements, such as a news media website, it should load much faster. It 
will block many of the pop-ups and auto-play media that can be quite annoying when conducting research. This 
protection will suffice for most users, but dedicated OSINT analysts may choose to take a more advanced 
approach.
I have previously recommended NoScript, Adblock Plus, Privacy Badger, and Disconnect as privacy add-ons 
that would help stop unwanted ads, tracking, and analytics. These are no longer present on any of my systems. 
I now only use uBlock Origin, as it replaces all of these options. This section may seem a bit overwhelming, but 
experimenting with the advanced settings should help you understand the functionality. Let's start with the 
basics.
Install uBlock Origin from the Firefox add-ons page or directly by navigating to 
htq)s://addons.mozilla.org/en-LJS/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/. You are now 
default, most known invasive advertisements, tracking code, and malicious 
would provide much needed protection from the internet. However, we
