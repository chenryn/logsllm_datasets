### Network DNS and Prefetch Settings
- **network.dns.disablePrefetch: TRUE** - Disables DNS prefetching.
- **network.dns.disablePrefetchFromHTTPS: FALSE** - Disables prefetching from HTTPS.
- **network.prefetch-next: FALSE** - Disables next-page prefetching.

When making changes in this area, you will receive a warning. However, the modifications we are making are safe. To change these settings, simply double-click on the setting to toggle it between "True" and "False." Some settings may require additional input, such as a number. Use the search bar in the `about:config` tab to find these settings. The desired settings are:
- **network.dns.disablePrefetch: FALSE**
- **network.dns.disablePrefetchFromHTTPS: FALSE**
- **network.prefetch-next: FALSE**

### Privacy and Security Settings
- **Uncheck the box titled "Remember search and form history."**
- **Check the box titled "Clear history when Firefox closes."**
- **Do NOT check the box titled "Always use private browsing mode,"** as it can interfere with Containers.
- **Uncheck "Browsing history" from the "Address Bar" menu.**
- **In the "Permissions" menu, click "Settings" next to Location, Camera, Microphone, and Notifications. Check the box titled "Block new requests..." for each of these options.**
- **Uncheck all options under "Firefox Data Collection and Use."**
- **Uncheck all options under "Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection."** This will prevent Firefox from sharing potential malicious site visits with third-party services, but it leaves you more exposed to undesired software attacks. It also protects your internet history from being shared with Google.
- **Enable "HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows."**

### Accessing Configuration Settings
Firefox allows users to modify many configuration settings, including those related to privacy and security. While some changes can be made in the preferences menu, using `about:config` provides more granular control. To access these settings, open Firefox and type `about:config` into the URL field. The terms URL, web address, and website are used interchangeably throughout this document.

### Additional Configuration Settings
- **media.peerconnection.enabled: FALSE**
- **media.peerconnection.turn.disable: TRUE**
- **media.peerconnection.use_document_iceservers: FALSE**
- **media.peerconnection.video.enabled: FALSE**
- **media.navigator.enabled: FALSE**

### Installing and Configuring Add-ons
While it is not essential to apply all these security settings, Firefox natively respects your privacy and security more than other browsers. These recommendations are for those who want an extra layer of protection. 

To install add-ons, open Firefox, click on the menu in the upper right, and select "Add-ons." Use the search field to find and install the desired extensions. Here are my recommended add-ons, in order of importance:

1. **Multi-Account Containers**: Allows you to separate your browsing activities without needing to clear your history, log in and out, or use multiple browsers.
2. **uBlock Origin**: Blocks invasive advertisements, tracking code, and malicious content. Install it from the Firefox add-ons page or directly from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/).

### WebRTC Settings
These settings address a potential vulnerability of leaked IP addresses. If you use audio or video communications within your browser, such as virtual conferencing software, these settings could break those services and should be ignored. If you are protected within a home network VPN, these changes are not vital.

### Multi-Account Containers
- **Open the Multi-Account Containers menu and click the "Manage Containers" option.**
- **Delete all containers by selecting each and clicking "Delete This Container."**
- **Create new containers by clicking the + in the upper left, entering the name, and choosing a color and icon.**

#### Example Usage
- **Communications**: Personal email and calendar accounts.
- **Financial**: Banking and credit card accounts.
- **Search**: All Google queries.
- **Alias**: Any social network accounts in another name.

### uBlock Origin
- **Install uBlock Origin from the Firefox add-ons page or directly from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/).**
- **Click on the uBlock Origin icon, select "Dashboard," and enable "I am an advanced user."**
- **On the "Filters" tab, consider enabling additional data sets for extended protection.**

This setup will provide a robust and secure browsing experience, tailored to your needs.
