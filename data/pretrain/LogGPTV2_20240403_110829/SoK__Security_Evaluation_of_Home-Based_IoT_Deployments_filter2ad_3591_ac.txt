but often fail with due diligence. Realistically, many vendors
do not have all the expertise to develop, manage, and deploy
these heterogeneous technologies. Vendors that lack expertise
in speciﬁc areas can outsource to specialized third-parties to
develop their product.
End-Users. Home-based IoT deployments transform simple
home-based networks to complex enterprise-like networks.
End-users can follow good security practices by conﬁguring
devices to use encryption, disable remote administration fea-
tures, and segment their network. Most importantly, consumers
can inﬂuence vendors by purchasing privacy-aware and secure
devices. Our portal is meant to give an objective security
assessment of IoT devices and allow consumers to make
informed decisions.
Other Parties. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not direct
stakeholders, but
the ubiquity of home-based IoT devices
affects the operation of their networks. Much of the trafﬁc seen
by the ISPs will be encrypted, but ISPs can identify devices
by destinations, service ports, and communication frequency.
ISPs can potentially implement technical remedies to block
certain ports, but legal policies are needed to intervene. These
decisions can pose policy and compliance disputes due to the
global nature of IoT and international jurisprudence [4]. ISPs
can offer their expertise in running and operating residential
Internet networks that can help identify implications around
home-based IoT deployments.
Cloud providers offer infrastructure-as-a-service to many
IoT vendors and have years of experience in developing,
running, and securing cloud infrastructures and platforms.
Their offerings are economical and practical for vendors, but
they do suffer from outages occasionally [76]. Cloud providers
are playing an important role in securing IoT deployments and
should continue to offer tailored cloud services that alleviate
security responsibilities from vendors.
B. Recommendations
Measurements. We recommend additional measurements
for inter-device communication, mobile application-to-device
interaction, and trust relationship between IoT components.
Inter-device communications (device-to-device and mobile
application-to-device) are not well studied within the LAN.
Many IoT systems, like home assist devices, auto-discover
and interact with other devices on the LAN without users’
consent, which warrants further investigation to understand
the security and privacy implications as a result of these
communications. Further, conducting longitudinal studies can
expose latent ﬂaws that are otherwise difﬁcult
to observe
without temporal analysis.
Best Practices. Best practices and guidelines for the IoT
components are readily available, but their utilization is low.
Some of the evaluated devices have very good practices that
other vendors can beneﬁt from, including mobile application
implementation, cloud service conﬁguration, device provision-
ing, and secure deployment and interaction of components.
These design and implementation patterns should be evaluated
in-depth to understand their cost/beneﬁts to vendors. Govern-
ment legislation can encourage economical or policy-based
incentives to inﬂuence vendors in adapting best practices.
Standards. Many well-established vendors have put forth
standards for IoT systems, but there is no consensus among
the community. Vendors and researchers should combine their
expertise to jointly draft industry standards that provide tech-
niques to address common mistakes found in home-based IoT
systems. Some home-based IoT systems have cyber-physical
components, like connected ovens, fridges, and water heaters.
These classes of IoT systems must be regulated by safety
mandates and code standards to ensure no physical harm can
result from their abuse or components failure. The government
must play an active role in the development of these standards
to protect consumers’ safety and privacy.
VI. CONCLUSION
This work systematized the existing literature for home-
based IoT devices through an abstract model that allowed us
to derive insights. We used the same methodology to evaluate
45 IoT devices and found much of the same issues discussed
in the literature exist in IoT systems today. We make available
our results and the evaluation dataset on our portal and invite
researchers to contribute and reproduce our work. We envision
this effort to be a central pillar for evaluating home-based IoT
devices, providing data for researchers, and collaborating with
vendors.
