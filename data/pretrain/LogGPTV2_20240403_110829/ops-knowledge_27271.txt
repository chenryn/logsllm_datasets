User: In a large-scale Internet scenario, how to achieve high-performance content distribution and caching? Please give a plan.
Assistant: Achieving high-performance content distribution and caching requires the following solutions: 1. Establish a distributed caching system: In Internet-scale scenarios, a single server cannot meet the storage requirements of high concurrent requests and large-capacity data, so it is necessary to establish a distributed cache system. cache system. It can be implemented by using open source software such as Memcached and Redis or self-developed cache. 2. Pre-caching acceleration: Caching is performed at the network device layer such as CDN and load balancing, and user access is accelerated through closer routes and faster network speeds, reducing the load on back-end servers. 3. Adopt different caching strategies for different business scenarios. For example, for popular content, the LRU (least recently used) strategy is used to ensure the cache hit rate; for unstable requests, the write-back cache strategy is used to first write the data to the cache and then asynchronously write to the back-end database to improve response speed and Concurrency. 4. Build a distributed content distribution network (CDN): CDN can distribute content to multiple nodes around the world, and users can obtain data from the nearest node, reducing network delay and congestion, and improving access speed and concurrent processing capabilities. 5. Use dynamic content distribution technology: pre-place commonly used resources on CDN cache nodes. When a request arrives, CDN can dynamically select the optimal node to respond to the request according to the user's request parameters and geographical location, avoiding a single node resulting load pressure. The above are the solutions adopted to achieve high-performance content distribution and caching. Through these methods, the rendering speed of the page can be improved, so that users can obtain a better experience.
