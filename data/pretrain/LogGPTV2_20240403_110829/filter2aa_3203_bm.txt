### IPv6 Traffic Example: End-to-End Delivery of a Web Page

This example demonstrates the following aspects of IPv6 traffic:
- Name resolution using DNS
- End-to-end delivery using a source host, intermediate routers, and a destination host
- Creation of a TCP connection
- Use of HTTP to download the HTML text of a Web page

#### Network Configuration

**Figure 10-10** shows a simple private IPv6 intranet consisting of four subnets connected by three routers. The intranet includes a Web client, a DNS server, and a Web server.

**Figure 10-10: An Example IPv6 Intranet**

The following sections describe the IPv6 configuration of each component in the network.

##### Web Client
- **IPv6 Address:** 2001:DB8:0:13::1
- **Subnet:** 2001:DB8:0:13::/64
- **Default Router:** FE80::A (Router 1)
- **DNS Server:** 2001:DB8:0:47::2

**Routes:**
- 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 (directly attached network route)
- ::/0 with the next-hop address of FE80::A (default route)

**Note:** To simplify the discussion, only the most relevant routes are listed for each component.

##### Router 1

### Web Traffic Example

This example assumes the following initial conditions:
- Neighbor and destination caches on all components are empty.
- The DNS client resolver cache on the Web client is empty.
- The Web browser on the Web client has not cached the contents of the Web page on the Web server.

In this example, a user on the Web client opens a Web browser, types the address `http://web1.example.com/example.htm` in the address bar, and presses ENTER. The following sequence of messages is sent:

1. **DNS Name Query Request:**
   - The Web client sends a DNS Name Query Request message to the DNS server.
   
2. **DNS Name Query Response:**
   - The DNS server sends a DNS Name Query Response message to the Web client.
   
3. **TCP Synchronize (SYN):**
   - The Web client sends a TCP SYN segment to the Web server.
   
4. **TCP SYN-Acknowledgement (ACK):**
   - The Web server sends a TCP SYN-ACK segment to the Web client.
   
5. **TCP ACK:**
   - The Web client sends a TCP ACK segment to the Web server.
   
6. **HTTP Get:**
   - The Web client sends an HTTP GET message to the Web server.
   
7. **HTTP Get-Response:**
   - The Web server sends an HTTP GET-Response message to the Web client.

### Detailed Process: DNS Name Query Request

1. **Name Resolution:**
   - The Web browser parses the address and uses the `getaddrinfo()` function to resolve the name `web1.example.com` to its IPv6 address.
   - The DNS server has a single AAAA record for `web1.example.com`.

2. **Message Construction:**
   - The Web client constructs a DNS Name Query Request message with the source IPv6 address `2001:DB8:0:13::1` and the destination IPv6 address `2001:DB8:0:47::2`.

3. **Destination Cache Check:**
   - The Web client checks its destination cache for an entry for `2001:DB8:0:47::2` and does not find a match.

4. **Route Determination:**
   - The Web client determines the closest matching route for `2001:DB8:0:47::2`, which is the default route (`::/0`).
   - The next-hop IPv6 address is set to `FE80::A`, and the next-hop interface is the network adapter attached to the `2001:DB8:0:13::/64` subnet.

5. **Cache Update:**
   - The Web client updates its destination cache with an entry for `2001:DB8:0:47::2` with the next-hop IPv6 address `FE80::A`.

6. **Neighbor Cache Check:**
   - The Web client checks its neighbor cache for an entry with the IPv6 address `FE80::A` and does not find a match.

7. **Neighbor Solicitation:**
   - The Web client sends a Neighbor Solicitation message to the solicited node multicast IPv6 address `FF02::1:FF00:A`, querying the `2001:DB8:0:13::/64` subnet for the MAC address of the interface assigned the IPv6 address `FE80::A`.
