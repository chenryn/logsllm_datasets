Web Traffic Example 
This example assumes the following: 
The neighbor and destination caches on all of the components of the network are empty. 
The DNS client resolver cache on the Web client is empty. 
The Web browser on the Web client has not cached the contents of the Web page on the Web server. 
In this example, a user on the Web client opens a Web browser, types the address 
http://web1.example.com/example.htm in the Web browser's Address bar, and presses ENTER. The 
computers on this example intranet send the following set of messages: 
1. The Web client sends a DNS Name Query Request message to the DNS server. 
2. The DNS server sends a DNS Name Query Response message to the Web client. 
3. The Web client sends a TCP Synchronize (SYN) segment to the Web server. 
4. The Web server sends a TCP SYN-Acknowledgement (ACK) segment to the Web client. 
5. The Web client sends a TCP ACK segment to the Web server. 
6. The Web client sends an HTTP Get message to the Web server. 
7. The Web server sends an HTTP Get-Response message to the Web client. 
The following sections describe the end-to-end delivery of each of these messages. 
DNS Name Query Request Message to the DNS Server 
When the Web client sends the DNS Name Query Request message to the DNS server, the following 
process occurs: 
1. The Web browser parses the address in the Address bar and uses a Windows Sockets getaddrinfo() 
Chapter 10 – TCP/IP End-to-End Delivery 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 304 
function to attempt to resolve the name web1.example.com to its IPv6 address. For this example, the 
DNS server is storing only a single AAAA record for the name web1.example.com. 
2. The Web client constructs a DNS Name Query Request message with the source IPv6 address of 
2001:DB8:0:13::1 and the destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2. 
3. The Web client checks its destination cache for an entry for the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2 
and does not find a match. 
4. The Web client performs the route determination process to find the closest matching route for the 
destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2. The default route (::/0) is the closest matching route. 
The Web client sets the next-hop IPv6 address to FE80::A and the next-hop interface to the network 
adapter attached to the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
5. The Web client updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:47::2 with the next-hop 
IPv6 address of FE80::A and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 
2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
6. The Web client checks its neighbor cache for an entry with the IPv6 address of FE80::A and does not 
find a match. 
7. The Web client sends a Neighbor Solicitation message to the solicited node multicast IPv6 address 
FF02::1:FF00:A, querying the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet for the MAC address of the interface that is 
assigned the IPv6 address of FE80::A. 
8. Because Router 1 is listening on the solicited node multicast address of FF02::1:FF00:A, the router 
receives the Neighbor Solicitation message. The router adds an entry to its neighbor cache for the 
IPv6 address 2001:DB8:0:13::1 and the MAC address of the Web client's interface on the 
2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
9. Router 1 sends a unicast Neighbor Advertisement message to the Web client. 
10. The Web client updates its neighbor cache with an entry for the IPv6 address of FE80::A and the 
MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
11. The Web client sends the unicast DNS Name Query Request message destined for 
2001:DB8:0:47::2 to the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
12. Router 1 receives the DNS Name Query Request message. 
13. Router 1 checks its destination cache for an entry for 2001:DB8:0:47::2 and does not find a match. 
14. Router 1 performs the route determination process for the destination address 2001:DB8:0:47::2. The 
closest matching route is the route for 2001:DB8:0:47::/64. Router 1 sets the next-hop address to 
FE80::C and the next-hop interface to the network adapter that is attached to the 2001:DB8:0:21::/64 
subnet. 
15. Router 1 updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:47::2 with the next-hop IPv6 
address of FE80::C and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 
2001:DB8:0:21::/64 subnet. 
16. Router 1 checks its neighbor cache for an entry with the IPv6 address of FE80::C and does not find a 
match. 
17. Router 1 sends a Neighbor Solicitation message to the solicited node multicast IPv6 address 
Chapter 10 – TCP/IP End-to-End Delivery 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 305 
FF02::1:FF00:C, querying the 2001:DB8:0:21::/64 subnet for the MAC address of the interface that is 
assigned the IPv6 address of FE80::C. 
18. Because Router 2 is listening on the solicited node multicast address of FF02::1:FF00:C, it receives 
the Neighbor Solicitation message and adds an entry to its neighbor cache for the IPv6 address 
FE80::B and the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:21::/64 subnet. 
19. Router 2 sends a unicast Neighbor Advertisement message to Router 1. 
20. Router 1 updates its neighbor cache with an entry for the IPv6 address of FE80::C and the MAC 
address of Router 2's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:21::/64 subnet. 
21. Router 1 forwards the unicast DNS Name Query Request message destined for 2001:DB8:0:47::2 to 
Router 2's MAC address on the 2001:DB8:0:21::/64 subnet. 
22. Router 2 receives the DNS Name Query Request message, checks its destination cache for an entry 
for 2001:DB8:0:47::2, and does not find a match. 
23. Router 2 performs the route determination process for the destination address 2001:DB8:0:47::2. The 
closest matching route is the route for 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 (a directly attached network route). Router 
2 sets the next-hop address to the packet's destination address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2 and the next-
hop interface to the network adapter that is attached to the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
24. Router 2 updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:47::2 with the next-hop IPv6 
address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2 and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 
2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
25. Router 2 checks its neighbor cache for an entry with the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2 and does 
not find a match. 
26. Router 2 sends a Neighbor Solicitation message to the solicited node multicast IPv6 address 
FF02::1:FF00:2, querying the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet for the MAC address of the interface that is 
assigned the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2. 
27. Because the DNS server is listening on the solicited node multicast address of FF02::1:FF00:2, it 
receives the Neighbor Solicitation message and adds an entry to its neighbor cache for the IPv6 
address FE80::D and the MAC address of Router 2's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
28. The DNS server sends a unicast Neighbor Advertisement message to Router 2. 
29. Router 2 updates its neighbor cache with an entry for the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2 and the 
MAC address of the DNS server's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
30. Router 2 forwards the unicast DNS Name Query Request message destined for 2001:DB8:0:47::2 to 
the MAC address of the DNS server's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
31. The DNS server receives the packet and passes the DNS Name Query Request message to the 
DNS Server service.  
32. The DNS Server service finds the AAAA record for the name web1.example.com and resolves it to 
the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3. 
For the end-to-end delivery of the DNS Name Query Request message, the following has occurred: 
The Web client sent the DNS Name Query Request message, and Router 1 and Router 2 forwarded it 
over the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64, 2001:DB8:0:21::/64, and 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnets to the DNS server.

for FE80::B and 2001:DB8:0:47::2. 
The DNS server's neighbor cache has an entry for FE80::D. 
DNS Name Query Response Message to the Web Client 
When the DNS server sends the DNS Name Query Response message to the Web client, the following 
process occurs: 
1. The DNS Server service constructs a DNS Name Query Response message with the source IPv6 
address of 2001:DB8:0:47::2 and the destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:13::1. 
2. The DNS server checks its destination cache for an entry for the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:13::1 
and does not find a match. 
3. The DNS server performs the route determination process to find the closest matching route for the 
destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:13::1. The default route (::/0) is the closest matching route.

adapter attached to the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
4. The DNS server updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1 with the next-hop 
IPv6 address of FE80::D and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 
2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
5. The DNS server checks its neighbor cache for an entry with the IPv6 address of FE80::D and finds a 
match.

Response message destined for 2001:DB8:0:13::1 to the MAC address of Router 2's interface on the 
2001:DB8:0:47::/64 subnet. 
7. Router 2 receives the DNS Name Query Response message, checks its destination cache for an 
entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1, and does not find a match. 
8. Router 2 performs the route determination process for the destination address 2001:DB8:0:13::1. The 
closest matching route is the route for 2001:DB8:0:13::/64. Router 2 sets the next-hop address to 
FE80::B and the next-hop interface to the network adapter that is attached to the 2001:DB8:0:21::/64 
subnet. 
9. Router 2 updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1 with the next-hop IPv6 
address of FE80::B and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 
2001:DB8:0:21::/64 subnet.

12. Router 1 receives the DNS Name Query Response message, checks its destination cache for an 
entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1, and does not find a match. 
13. Router 1 performs the route determination process for the destination address 2001:DB8:0:13::1. The 
closest matching route is the route for 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 (a directly attached network route). Router 
1 sets the next-hop address to the packet's destination address of 2001:DB8:0:13::1 and the next-
hop interface to the network adapter that is attached to the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
14. Router 1 updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1 with the next-hop IPv6 
address of 2001:DB8:0:13::1 and the next-hop interface of the network adapter that is attached to the 
2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
15. Router 1 checks its neighbor cache for an entry with the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:13::1 and finds 
a match. 
16. Using the neighbor cache entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1, Router 1 forwards the unicast DNS Name 
Query Response message destined for 2001:DB8:0:13::1 to the MAC address of the Web client's 
interface on the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
17. The Web client receives the packet and passes the DNS Name Query Response message to the 
DNS Client service.  
18. The DNS Client service on the Web client passes the resolved IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3 to 
Windows Sockets. 
19. Windows Sockets passes the resolved IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3 to the Web browser. 
For the end-to-end delivery of the DNS Name Query Response message, the following has occurred: 
The DNS server sent the DNS Name Query Response message, and Router 2 and Router 1 forwarded 
it over the 2001:DB8:0:47::/64, 2001:DB8:0:21::/64, and 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnets to the Web client. 
The DNS server's destination cache has a new entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1. 
Router 2's destination cache has a new entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1. 
Router 1's destination cache has a new entry for 2001:DB8:0:13::1. 
When the Web client sends the TCP SYN segment to the Web server, the following process occurs: 
1. The Web browser, upon obtaining the resolved address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3 from Windows Sockets, 
uses a Windows Sockets connect() function to create a TCP connection between the Web client and 
the Web server. 
2. The Web client constructs a TCP SYN segment message with the source IPv6 address of 
2001:DB8:0:13::1 and the destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3. 
3. The Web client checks its destination cache for an entry for the IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3 
and does not find a match. 
4. The Web client performs the route determination process to find the closest matching route for the 
destination IPv6 address of 2001:DB8:0:48::3. The default route (::/0) is the closest matching route. 
The Web client sets the next-hop IPv6 address to FE80::A and the next-hop interface to the network 
adapter attached to the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 subnet. 
5. The Web client updates its destination cache with an entry for 2001:DB8:0:48::3 with the next-hop

destined for 2001:DB8:0:48::3 to the MAC address of Router 1's interface on the 2001:DB8:0:13::/64 
subnet. 
8. Router 1 receives the TCP SYN segment, checks its destination cache for an entry for 
2001:DB8:0:48::3, and does not find a match.
