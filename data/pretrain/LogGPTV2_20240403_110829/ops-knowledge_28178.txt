User: How to configure Nginx server in Linux system to realize load balancing and reverse proxy?
Assistant: To configure Nginx server in Linux system for load balancing and reverse proxy, you can follow the steps below: 1. Install Nginx Run the following command in Linux system to install Nginx: ``` sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx ` `` 2. Configure load balancing Edit the Nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, add an upstream block in the http block to define multiple backend servers to achieve load balancing. For example: ``` http { upstream backend { server localhost:8080; server localhost:8081; server localhost:8082; } server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } } ``` defines here A backend server group named backend includes 3 backend servers whose addresses are localhost:8080, localhost:8081 and localhost:8082 respectively. In the server block, we set the listening port of Nginx to 80, and use the proxy_pass command in the location block to proxy the request to the backend server group to achieve load balancing. 3. Configure reverse proxy To implement reverse proxy in Nginx, you can directly modify the above configuration, just change the address of the backend server in the proxy_pass command to the address of the target server to be proxied. For example: ``` http { server { listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://example.com; } } } ``` Here we still set the port that Nginx listens to as 80, and use the proxy_pass command in the location block to Proxy the request to the target server example.com. 4. Save the configuration and reload Nginx Save the modified configuration file above and reload the Nginx service: ``` sudo nginx -t sudo service nginx reload ``` Among them, the `nginx -t` command is used to check the Nginx configuration file Is the syntax correct? The `service nginx reload` command is used to reload the Nginx service. If no errors are found during the check, the Nginx service can be reloaded to apply the new configuration. Through the above steps, configure the Nginx server in the Linux system to achieve load balancing and reverse proxy.
