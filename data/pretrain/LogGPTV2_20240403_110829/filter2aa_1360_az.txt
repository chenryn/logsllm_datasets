### Secure Resources Area

The secure resources for this book can be found at the provided address. Please follow my blog or Twitter account for any updates. It is your responsibility to update your tools as necessary, as changes may occur after publication. The torch has been passed.

Navigating to this page will present an interactive version of all tools. As I update my own pages, this live collection will be refreshed. After signing in with the username and password previously provided (osint9 / bookl43wt), you can execute queries without needing to download your own tools. I do not see any of your search activity, and query data is never stored on my server. This service is offered as a convenience to readers, but I still prefer the offline option for several reasons:

1. The live tools could disappear at any time due to takedown demands.
2. You cannot modify the live online version as you can with your own copy.
3. You must rely on my site being available during your investigations.

The offline version is always available on your desktop. Please use these resources responsibly. I suspect the live version may need to be removed someday due to potential abuse, but I am optimistic that we can use this valuable resource for our daily investigations until then.

### Bookmarking Your Tools

Regardless of where you save your set of tools, I highly recommend creating a bookmark within your browser for easy access. I prefer to keep them in my bookmarks toolbar so they are always one click away.

#### Instructions:
1. Navigate to your search tools. If using the Linux, Mac, or Windows OSINT machines, they are in the Tools folder on your desktop.
2. Double-click the file titled "Search.html" to open it in your default browser, preferably Firefox.
3. If the page opens in Chrome or another browser, open Firefox and use the file menu to select "Open File" and browse to the "Search.html" file.
4. Once the page loads, create a bookmark. In Linux and Windows, press "Ctrl" + "D" ("Command" + "D" on Mac).
5. When prompted, provide a name of "Tools" and save the page in the folder titled "Bookmarks Toolbar."
6. If your Bookmarks Toolbar is not visible, click on "View," then "Toolbars," and then "View Bookmarks Toolbar."
7. You should now see a new bookmark in your browser's toolbar titled "Tools." Click this button to immediately load the Search Engines tool.
8. Click through the other options in the left menu to access other search tool pages. I use this shortcut to launch my tools daily.

### Covert Accounts

Before proceeding with any investigation methods, it is important to discuss covert accounts, also known as "Sock Puppets." These are online profiles not associated with your true identity. Many social networks, such as Facebook and Instagram, now require you to be logged in to an account before conducting any queries. Using your true personal account could reveal your identity to the target. Covert accounts on these networks are free and can be created using fictitious information, though some networks make this more difficult than others. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Yahoo are known to have stringent verification processes. We will discuss ways around these in this chapter.

#### Email
It is vital to have a "clean" email address for your covert accounts. Every social network requires an email address for registration, and you should never use an already established personal address. Later chapters will explain methods for researching the owners behind email addresses, and those techniques can be applied to you and your own accounts. Therefore, consider starting fresh with a brand-new email account dedicated to covert profiles.

**Choice of Email Provider:**
- I do not recommend popular providers like GMX, ProtonMail, Yahoo, Gmail, or MSN, as they are heavily used by spammers and scammers and are therefore more scrutinized.
- My preference is Fastmail (https://ref.fm/ul4547153). This provider is unique because:
  - They do not require a pre-existing email address to obtain a new one.
  - They are less scrutinized by big services like Facebook.

Fastmail offers unlimited free accounts on a 30-day trial. I suggest choosing an email address ending in fastmail.us instead of fastmail.com, as it is less commonly used. Note that the free trial terminates your access in 30 days, so this may not be ideal for long-term investigations. Personally, I have a paid account that allows me 250 permanent alias email addresses.

#### Creating Covert Profiles

**Facebook:**
- Facebook is the most challenging for new account creation. They often require a cellular telephone number for verification.
- Solution: Turn off any VPN, Tor Browser, or IP masking service and connect from a residential or business internet connection. Clear your cache and log out of any accounts. Navigate to m.facebook.com (the mobile version) and use the Fastmail email address you created. This method usually bypasses the need for a cellular number. Public library Wi-Fi is a good option for account creation. Instagram follows similar procedures.

**Twitter:**
- Many Twitter techniques do not require an account, but third-party solutions do. I recommend having a covert account.
- As long as you provide a legitimate email address from a residential or business internet connection, you should have no issues. A VPN might work, but not always.

**Google/Gmail/Voice:**
- Google has become more aggressive in refusing suspicious account registrations, but they are still achievable.
- Use a Fastmail address as an alternative form of contact during account creation. Connecting through Chrome rather than a privacy-customized Firefox browser can help.

**Network Considerations:**
- I prefer to conduct online investigations behind a VPN, but this can be tricky. Creating accounts through a VPN often alerts the service of suspicious behavior.
- Use public Wi-Fi (e.g., local library or coffee shop) for account creation. After creation, access the account via a consistent VPN and location to build a pattern.

**Phone Number:**
- If a service finds your new account suspicious, it will prompt for a valid telephone number. Landlines and VOIP numbers are blocked, and a true cellular number is required.
- I use Mint Mobile SIM cards (available for $0.99 from Amazon) for a one-week free trial. Activate the SIM card, select a phone number, and use it to open accounts. Change the number to a VOIP option and secure the account with two-factor authentication (2FA).

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
- Immediately activate 2FA options once the account is created. This secondary security setting helps confirm that you are a real person, not an automated bot.

**Activity:**
- Remain active on the account. Dormant accounts are likely to be suspended. Access the account weekly to reduce the risk of blocking.

### Profile Content

While you can use personal social network accounts for searches, it is risky. Some services, like Facebook, may notify the target of your interest. For these reasons, I never use a personal profile during investigations and maintain multiple covert accounts.

**Adding Realism:**
- **Resume:** Posting a resume online can add realism. I recommend Almost Real Resume (fake.jsonresume.org) for generating artificial employment history, education, and interests.
- **Name and Background:** Generate a full alias profile, including maiden name, birthday, birthplace, zodiac sign, username, password, religion, and political view. Services like ElfQrin (elfqrin.com/fakeid.php) and Fake Name Generator (fakenamegenerator.com) can help.
- **Physical Space:** Use This Rental Does Not Exist (thisrentaldoesnotexist.com) to generate fake interior views of a home. These images can be used if you need to post pictures.

**Images:**
- Use This Person Does Not Exist (thispersondocsnotexist.com) to generate realistic headshots. Refresh the page for new images and generate multiple for future use.

### Search Engines

When your quoted search, such as "Michael Bazzell," returns too many results, add more specific terms. For example, adding "FBI" reduces the results from 31,800 to 12,000. This technique is vital when searching email addresses or usernames.

**Quotation Marks:**
- Placing a target name inside quotation marks ensures that the words appear together. Searching for "Michael Bazzell" returns 31,800 results, while "Michael Bazzell" without quotes returns 147,000, which may include unrelated results.

**Search Operators:**
- **Site Operator:** `site:forbes.com "Michael Bazzell"` returns all pages on forbes.com containing "Michael Bazzell."
- **File Type Operator:** `"Cisco" filetype:ppt` filters results to only PowerPoint files.
- **Hyphen (-):** `"Michael Bazzell" -police -FBI -osint -books` excludes specific terms to narrow down results.

**Real-World Application:**
- Use the site operator for background checks. For example, `site:amazon.com "target name"` can reveal user reviews and other information.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use search engines to gather accurate and relevant information.
