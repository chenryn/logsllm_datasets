Covert Accounts
OSINT Resources & Techniques 137
Se c t io n  II
OSINT Re s o u r c e s & Te c h n iq u e s
Before proceeding with any of the investigation methods here, it is important to discuss covert accounts, also 
referred to by some as "Sock Puppets". Covert accounts are online profiles which are not associated with your 
true identify. Many social networks, such as Facebook and Instagram, now require you to be logged in to an 
account before any queries can be conducted. Using your true personal account could reveal your identity as an 
investigator to the target. Covert accounts on all of the social networks mentioned here are free and can be 
completed using fictitious information. However, some networks will make this task more difficult than others. 
Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Yahoo are known to make you jump through hoops before you are 
granted access. We begin this chapter discussing ways around this.
Email: It is vital that you possess a "clean" email address for your covert accounts. Every social network requires 
an email address as a part of account registration, and you should never use an already established personal 
address. Later chapters explain methods for researching the owners behind email addresses, and those 
techniques can be applied to you and your own accounts. Therefore, consider starting fresh with a brand-new 
email account dedicated toward use for covert profiles.
The choice of email provider is key here. I do not recommend GMX, ProtonMail, Yahoo, Gmail, MSN, or any 
other extremely popular providers. These are heavily used by spammers and scammers, and are therefore more 
scrutinized than smaller providers. My preference is to create a free email account at Fastmail 
(https://ref.fm/ul4547153). This established mail provider is unique in two ways. First, they are one of the only 
remaining providers which do not require a pre-existing email address in order to obtain a new address. This 
means that there will be no connection from your new covert account to any personal accounts. Second, they 
are fairly off-radar" from big sendees such as Facebook, and are not scrutinized for malicious activity.
Some may consider this section to be the "guts" of the book. It contains the OSINT tips, tricks, and techniques 
which I have taught over the past twenty' years. Each chapter was rewritten and confirmed accurate in December 
2020. All outdated content was removed, many techniques were updated, and numerous new resources were 
added. The first four editions of this book only consisted of this section. Only recently have I adopted the 
preceding preparation section and the methodology topics toward the end. OSINT seems to have become a 
much more complex industry over the years. It is exciting to watch the community' grow and 1 am honored to 
play an extremely small role.
This section is split into several chapters, and each explains a common type of target investigation. I have isolated 
specific topics such as email addresses, usernames, social networks, and telephone numbers. Each chapter 
provides every valuable resource and technique which I have found beneficial toward my own investigations. 
No book could ever include even’ possible resource, as many tools become redundant after a superior version 
has been identified. I do my best to limit the "noise" and simply present the most robust options for each 
scenario. This section should serve as a reference when you encounter a specific need within your own 
investigations.
Fastmail will provide anyone unlimited free accounts on a 30-day trial. I suggest choosing an email address that 
ends in fastmail.us instead of fastmail.com, as that domain is less used than their official address. This is a choice 
during account creation. Once you have your new email address activated, you are ready to create covert profiles. 
Note that the free trial terminates your access to this email account in 30 days, so this may not be best for long­
term investigations. Personally, 1 possess a paid account which allows me 250 permanent alias email addresses.
138 Section II
• 
Facebook: This is by far the most difficult in terms of new account creation. For most new users, 
Facebook will require you to provide a cellular telephone number where a verification text can be sent 
and confirmed. Providing VOIP numbers such as a Google Voice account will not work anymore. I 
have found only one solution. Turn off any VPN, Tor Browser, or other IP address masking service 
and connect from a residential or business internet connection. Make sure you have cleared out all of 
your internet cache and logged out of any accounts. Instead of creating a new account on facebook.com, 
navigate directly to rn.facebook.com. This is the mobile version of their site which is more forgiving on 
new accounts. During account creation, provide the Fastmail email address that you created previously. 
In most situations, you should bypass the requirement to provide a cellular number. If this method 
failed, there is something about your computer or connection that is making Facebook unhappy. 
Persistence will always equal success eventually. I find public library Wi-Fi our best internet option 
during account creation. Instagram is similar to (and owned by) Facebook. Expect the same scrutiny.
• 
Twitter Many of the Twitter techniques presented later will not require an account. However, the 
third-part}- solutions will mandate that you be logged in to Twitter when using them. I highly 
recommend possessing a covert account before proceeding. As long as you provide a legitimate email 
address from a residential or business internet connection, you should have no issues. You may get 
away with using a VPN to create an account, but not always.
• 
Google/Gmail/Voice: While Google has become more aggressive at refusing suspicious account 
registrations, they are still very achievable. As with the previous methods, Google will likely block any 
new accounts that are created over Tor or a VPN. Providing your Fastmail address as an alternative 
form of contact during the account creation process usually satisfies their need to validate your request. 
I have also found that they seem more accommodating during account creation if you are connected 
through a Chrome browser versus a privacy-customized Firefox browser (Google owns Chrome).
• 
Network: 1 always prefer to conduct online investigations behind a VPN, but this can be tricky. 
Creating accounts through a VPN often alerts the service of your suspicious behavior. Creating accounts 
from public Wi-Fi, such as a local library’ or coffee shop, are typically less scrutinized. A day after 
creation from open Wi-Fi, I attempt to access while behind a VPN. I then consistendy select the same 
VPN company and general location upon every’ usage of the profile. This builds a pattern of my network 
and location, which helps maintain access to the account.
• 
Phone Number: The moment any service finds your new account to be suspicious, it will prompt you 
for a valid telephone number. Landlines and VOIP numbers are blocked, and they' will demand a true 
cellular number. Today, I keep a supply of Mint Mobile SIM cards, which can be purchased for S0.99 
from Amazon (https://amzn.to/2MRbGTI). Each card includes a telephone number with a one-week 
free trial. I activate the SIM card through an old Android phone, select a phone number, and use that 
number to open accounts across all of the major networks. As soon as the account is active, I change 
the telephone number to a VOIP option and secure the account with two-factor authentication (2FA).
• 
2FA: Once 1 have an account created, I immediately’ activate any’ two-factor authentication options. 
These are secondary’ security settings which require a text message or software token (Authy’) in order 
to access the account. Typically, this behavior tells the service that you are a real person behind the 
account, and not an automated bot using the profile for malicious reasons.
• 
Activity: After the account is created and secured, it is important to remain active. If you create a new 
account and allow it to sit dormant for months, it is likely’ to be suspended the moment y'ou log back in 
to the account. If you access the account weekly, it is less likely to be blocked.
You may’ assume that you can use your personal social network accounts to search for information. While this 
is possible, it is risky’. Some services may never indicate to the target that y’our specific profile was used for 
searching. Others, such as Facebook, will eventually notify the target that you have an interest in him, usually' in 
the form of friend recommendations. On any service, you are always one accidental click away from sending a 
friend request from your real account to the suspect For these reasons, I never use a personal social network 
profile during any' investigation. I maintain multiple covert accounts. The topic of undercover operations quickly’ 
exceeds the scope of this book. For our purposes, we simply need to be logged in to valid accounts in order to 
pacify the social networks. I will assume that you now have some accounts created. Let's dig in to online search.

Resume: If you want to add another layer of realism to your new online identity, you might consider posting a 
resume online. If your target begins investigating your profile and finds the resume, you may appear to be a real 
person. I find Almost Real Resume (fake.jsonresume.org) best for this purpose. It will generate artificial 
employment history', education, and interests.
Name and Background: It may be easy to create your own alias name, but could you quickly generate a maiden 
name, birthday, birthplace, zodiac sign, username, password, religion, and political view? This is where sen-ices 
such as ElfQrin (elfqrin.com/fakeid.php) and Fake Name Generator (fakenamegenerator.com) can be 
beneficial. The example below was created instantly with these services.

Possession of an empty profile on a social network may suffice for your investigations. However, lack of personal 
details might appear suspicious to both the provider and your target. Facebook is well known for suspending 
accounts which do not contain personal information, and your targets may conduct their own OSINT research 
into your publicly available details after you begin the hunt. For most scenarios, 1 believe you should populate a 
minimum amount of fake details into your covert profiles. You should never provide anything which may be 
associated with your true identity, such as interests, occupation, or location. Because of this, 1 rely heavily on 
randomly-generated and Al-produced content. The resources below have helped me within my own profile 
creation. Consider your own needs and employer policies before proceeding with your accounts.
Images: You may want a headshot within your profile which adds a layer of authenticity to your new covert 
account. This can also eliminate scrutiny from Facebook and Twitter when their algorithms suspect your profile 
to be fraudulent. I recommend This Person Does Not Exist (thispersondocsnotexist.com). This site generates 
a very realistic image of a "person", which is entirely generated by computers. The image you see is not a real 
person and should not be visible anywhere else online. Refreshing the page generates a new image. If you find 
this beneficial, I encourage you to generate numerous images for future use in the event the site should disappear.

When your quoted search, such as "Michael Bazzell”, returns too many results, you should add to your search. 
When I add the term "FBI" after my name, the results reduce from 31,800 to 12,000. These results all contain 
pages that have the words "Michael" and "Bazzell" next to each other, and include the term "FBI" somewhere 
on the page. While all of these results may not be about me, the majority will be and can be easily digested. 
Adding the occupation, residence city, general interest, or college of the target may help eliminate unrelated 
results. This search technique can be vital when searching email addresses or usernames. When searching the 
email address of "PI:EMAIL", without quotes, 1 receive 14,200 results. When 1 search 
"PI:EMAIL" with quotes, I receive only 7 results diat actually contain that email address 
(which does not reach my inbox).
The first stop for many researchers will be a popular search engine. The two big players in the United States are 
Google and Bing. This chapter will go into great detail about the advanced ways to use both and others. Most 
of these techniques can apply to any search engine, but many examples will be specific for these two. Much of 
this chapter is unchanged from the 7,h edition.
There are entire books dedicated to Google searching and Google hacking. Most of these focus on penetration 
testing and securing computer networks. These are full of great information, but are often overkill for the 
investigator looking for quick personal information. A few simple rules can help locate more accurate data. No 
book in existence will replace practicing these techniques in a live web browser. When searching, you cannot 
break anything. Play around and get familiar with the advanced options.
Placing a target name inside of quotation marks will make a huge difference in a quick first look for information. 
If I conducted a search for my name without quotes, the result is 147,000 pages that include the words "Michael" 
and "Bazzell". These pages do not necessarily have these words right next to each other. The word "Michael" 
could be next to another person’s name, while "Bazzell" could be next to yet another person's name. These 
results can provide inaccurate information. They may include a reference to "Michael Santo" and "Barty Bazzell", 
but not my name. Since technically the words "Michael" and "Bazzell" appear on the page, you are stuck with 
the result in your list. In order to prevent this, you should always use quotes around die name of your target. 
Searching for the term "Michael Bazzell", including the quotes, reduces the search results to 31,800.
Each of these pages will contain the words "Michael" and "Bazzell" right next to each other. While Google and 
other search engines have technology in place to search related names, this is not always perfect, and does not 
apply to searches with quotes. For example, the search for "Michael Bazzell", without quotes, located pages that 
reference Mike Bazzell (instead of Michael). This same search with quotes did not locate these results. Placing 
quotes around any search terms tells Google to search exactly what you tell it to search. If your target's name is 
"Michael", you may want to consider an additional search for "Mike". If a quoted search returns nothing, or few 
results, you should remove the quotes and search again.
Most search engines allow the use of commands within the search field. These commands are not actually part 
of the search terms and are referred to as operators. There are two parts to most operator searches, and each 
are separated by a colon. To the left of the colon is the type of operator, such as "site" (website) or "ext" (file
file type. The following will

The result is over 10,000,000 websites that include the words Cisco and PowerPoint in the content. However, 
these are not all actual PowerPoint documents. The following search refines our example for accuracy.
"Cisco" filetype:ppt
However, this search only displayed 
them. If you want to view every' page
extension). To the right is the rule for the operator, such as the target domain or 
explain each operator and the most appropriate uses.
Another operator that works with both Google and Bing is the file type filter. It allows y'ou to filter any' search 
results by' a single file type extension. While Google allows this operator to be shortened to "ext", Bing does 
not. Therefore, I will use the original "filetype" operator in my search examples. Consider the following search 
attempting to locate PowerPoint presentation files associated with the company Cisco.
Google, and other search engines, allow the use of operators within the search string. An operator is text that is 
added to the search, which performs a function. My favorite operator is the "site:" function. This operator 
provides two benefits to the search results. First, it will only provide results of pages located on a specific domain. 
Second, it will provide all of the results containing the search terms on that domain. 1 will use my' name again 
for a demonstration. I conducted a search of "Michael Bazzell" on Google. One of the results is a link to the 
website forbes.com. This search result is one of multiple pages on that domain that includes a reference to me.
one of the many' pages on that domain that possessed my' name within 
. . „ on a specific domain that includes your target of interest, tine site operator 
is required. Next, I conducted the following exact search.
The result was all eight pages on forbes.com that include my' name within the content. This technique can be 
applied to any* domain. This includes social networks, blogs, and any' other website that is indexed by’ search 
engines.
Another simple way to use this technique is to locate every' page that is part of a specific domain. A search query' 
of sitednteltechniques.com displays all 628 pages that are publicly’ available on my' personal website. This can be 
a great way to review all the content of a target's personal website without attempting to navigate the actual site. 
It is very’ easy to miss content by’ clicking around within a website. With this technique, y'ou should see all of the 
pages in a format that is easy’ to digest. Also, some of the pages on a website that the author may' consider 
private may’ actually' be public if he or she ever linked to them from a public page. Once Google has indexed 
the page, we can view the content using the "site" operator.
Real World Application: While conducting private background checks, I consistendy use the site operator. A 
search such as site:amazon.com" and the target name can reveal interesting information. A previous 
background check of an applicant that signed an affidavit declaring no previous drug or alcohol dependencies 
produced some damaging results. The search provided user submitted reviews that he had left on Amazon in 
reference to books that he had purchased that assisted him with his continual addiction to controlled substances. 
Again, this result may have appeared somewhere in the numerous general search results of the target; however, 
the site operator directed me exactly where I needed to look.
