I am using the latest packages with google_sign_in version 3.0.4 and flutter
version 0.4.4. The following code doesn't catch sign_in_failed error when I
dismiss the google sign in dialog and I get a PlatformException.
    try {
          googleUser = await _googleSignIn.signIn();
        } catch (error) {
          googleUser = null;
          print(error);
        }
Is there some mistake in my code or is it a bug in the package?
