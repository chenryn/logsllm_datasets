ily rely on timers with hourglass-like precision to throttle
queries. The TARDIS consists purely of software, making
the mechanism easy to deploy on devices with SRAM. A
novel aspect of the TARDIS is its use of memory decay or
data remanence for improved security rather than attack-
ing security. Without the TARDIS, batteryless devices are
unlikely to give you the time of day.

Appendix
Model of Decay Probabilities
Knowing the DRV distribution of a collection of SRAM
cells makes it possible to predict the amount of memory
decay that will result from reaching any known minimum
supply voltage during a power cycle. We propose a simple
and intuitive 3-parameter (α, µ,σ) model to characterize
the DRV distribution. We chose the parameters such that
the model predictions agree with empirical data relating
memory decay to minimum supply voltage.
Cells eligible for memory decay after being written
with a value of 1 are those with a ground state of 0. We
use g = 0 to denote cells with a 0 ground state, and use α
to denote the fraction of cells with this ground state; α is
therefore the largest fraction of cells that can decay after
writing a 1 to all cells.
Pr(g = 0) = α
(2)
Among cells that are eligible for memory decay, we
assume that DRVs are normally distributed with mean µ
and standard deviation σ (Equation 3).
DRV | (g = 0) ∼ N (cid:0)µ,σ 2(cid:1)
(3)
The probability of a randomly selected cell being eli-
gible for memory decay and having DRV = v is given by
Equation 4. This is an α-scaled instance of the PDF of a
normally distributed random variable, and we refer to this
as the “DRV probability” of voltage v.
Pr ((g = 0)∧ (DRV = v)) =
α
√
2π

e−(v−µ)
2/(2σ 2) (4)
If the minimum voltage of a power cycle is known, then
the 3-parameter model can predict the memory decay. The
cells that will decay are eligible cells with a DRV that is
above the minimum supply voltage reached during the
power cycle. A closed-form equation for predicting the
memory decay from the minimum voltage and model
parameters is then given by Equation 5; this equation is 1
minus the CDF of a normally distributed random variable,
scaled by α.

A 3-parameter model is evaluated according to how
well its predicted memory decay matches empirical data.
The evaluation is performed using a set of n observations
(cid:104)v0,D(v0)(cid:105),(cid:104)v1,D(v1)(cid:105), . . . ,(cid:104)vn−1,D(vn−1)(cid:105); each obser-
vation is a measurement of the minimum supply voltage
reached during a power cycle, and the memory decay
observed across that power cycle. The prediction error of
any model is deﬁned according to Equation 6. We initially
use the set of measurements to ﬁnd the model parameters
that minimize the prediction error (see Figure 8).
ERR(α, µ,σ ) =

(DPRED (vi,α, µ,σ )− D (vi))

After measurements are used to ﬁt the model parame-
ters to empirical data, the model is subsequently used to
predict memory-decay-vs.-time curves from voltage-vs.-
time measurements (see Figure 10).
