ABSTRACT
Random walks form a critical foundation in many social net-
work based security systems and applications. Currently,
the design of such social security mechanisms is limited to
the classical paradigm of using ﬁxed-length random walks
for all nodes on a social graph. However, the ﬁxed-length
walk paradigm induces a poor trade-oﬀ between security and
other desirable properties.
In this paper, we propose SmartWalk, a security enhanc-
ing system which incorporates adaptive random walks in so-
cial network security applications. We utilize a set of su-
pervised machine learning techniques to predict the neces-
sary random walk length based on the structural charac-
teristics of a social graph. Using experiments on multiple
real world topologies, we show that the desired walk length
starting from a speciﬁc node can be well predicted given the
local features of the node, and limited knowledge for a small
set of training nodes. We describe node-adaptive and path-
adaptive random walk usage models, where the walk length
adaptively changes based on the starting node and the inter-
mediate nodes on the path, respectively. We experimentally
demonstrate the applicability of adaptive random walks on
a number of social network based security and privacy sys-
tems, including Sybil defenses, anonymous communication
and link privacy preserving systems, and show up to two
orders of magnitude improvement in performance.

INTRODUCTION
Random walks in security applications. Nowadays,
many applications leverage the trust relationships in social
networks to improve their system security and privacy, such
as Sybil defenses [51, 52, 35, 24, 13, 44, 43], anonymous
communication [37, 34, 12, 15], secure routing [31, 24, 32],
censorship resilience [41, 1, 2] and secure reputation sys-
tems [44, 17]. An important approach used in the design
of these systems is to perform random walks on social net-
works. Random walk is a random sequence of nodes where
successive nodes are neighbors. Many algorithms based on

random walks are gaining increasing popularity since they
are simple to implement and can be used in both centralized
and distributed systems to probe structural properties of the
whole network [30, 40, 48, 18, 39, 28]. For instance, Pons
et al.
in [40] proposed a random walk based algorithm to
capture the community structure in large networks. Since
random walks can help sample and obtain some structural
information of a social network, they play a crucial role in
many social network based security systems. For instance,
Danezis et al. and others [12, 37, 34] proposed decentral-
ized protocols for anonymous communications that leverage
users’ social links and use random walks to build circuits for
onion routing. Mittal et al. in [33] perturbed a social graph
by replacing real edges with edges between starting nodes
and terminal nodes of random walks in order to provide link
privacy. Yu et al. proposed SybilGuard [52] and SybilLimit
[51], two Sybil defense protocols that perform on random
walk based routes and register public keys with the tails to
diﬀerentiate Sybil users from benign users.
Designers’ Dilemma: Security vs. Performance.
One important and interesting parameter of random walks
is its length. The choice of random walk length is closely
related to structural properties of networks and has a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the trade-oﬀ between system security
and system performance/utility. In existing security mech-
anisms, only the classical paradigm of ﬁxed length random
walks for all nodes is considered, i.e., random walks starting
from each node in the network use the same ﬁxed length.
Since random walk length greatly inﬂuences both the se-
curity/privacy and the application utility, the lack of ﬂexi-
bility in the ﬁxed length random walk paradigm can leave
the system design in a dilemma. For example, in Sybil-
Limit [51], unnecessarily long random walks give adversaries
more power to corrupt the region formed by honest users.
However, a small random walk length leads to a high false
positive rate, i.e., a high percentage of misclassiﬁed benign
users. For graph privacy [33], strong link privacy relies on
deep perturbation to the original graph, indicating a large
random walk length. However, as the ﬁxed random walk
length increases, the perturbed graph gradually approaches
to a random graph, incurring a signiﬁcant loss of utility.
In social network based anonymous systems [34], the ex-
pected anonymity is a function of the random walk length
and longer random walks enhance the anonymity at the cost
of extra latency. These challenges are diﬃcult to address in
the case of ﬁxed length random walks.
Contributions. To address the above challenges, we de-
velop SmartWalk, which introduces the concept of adaptive
random walks across nodes in the network; our approach
uses heterogeneous walk lengths across nodes in the net-
work to enhance the trade-oﬀ between system security and
performance.
1. We introduce the concept of local mixing time, which
measures the minimum random walk length for a certain
starting node to be within a given distance 1 to stationar-
ity (see Section 3 for formal deﬁnitions). We show that in
real-world social graphs, the local mixing time across nodes
exhibits a heterogeneous and long-tail distribution.
2. We present a local mixing time prediction algorithm,
which employs supervised machine-learning methods to ef-
fectively predict the local mixing time for a node according
to its local topological features and limited global knowledge
of the graph (directly computing the local mixing time re-
quires the knowledge of the entire social graph and can be
expensive). Our prediction performance is evaluated using
Facebook friendship and interaction graphs and a Twitter
graph. We show that with a small subset of training sam-
ples (around 1% of all nodes) and local characteristics (about
3-hop neighbourhood), we can get satisﬁable prediction of a
node’s local mixing time.
3. Compared to conventional security mechanisms, which
leverage the same walk length for all nodes, we propose
two novel algorithms which produce adaptive random walks
based on the underlying heterogeneity of the local mixing
time in social networks. The node-adaptive algorithm de-
termines the length of random walks by the starting node.
The path-adaptive algorithm automatically adjusts the re-
maining random walk length according to the intermediate
nodes along the walk path.
4. We test the applicability of these two algorithms in a
set of random walk based security and privacy applications
including Sybil defense, anonymous communication and link
privacy preserving systems. Using real-world social net-
work topologies, we show that both the node-adaptive and
path-adaptive algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform the exist-
ing ﬁxed length algorithms for any given expected random
walk length. The improvement can be up to two orders of
magnitude. By properly adjusting walk lengths to nodes
and paths, our algorithms are able to oﬀer ﬁne-grained con-
trol over the trade-oﬀ between security/privacy and other
metrics for these systems.
To the best of our knowledge, all the existing random
walk-based security and privacy mechanisms [29, 3, 14, 11,
36, 6, 4] use a uniform walk length, while our work is the ﬁrst
to adapt the random walk length depending on the struc-
tural characteristics of nodes. Looking ahead, our approach
has broad potential to impact security-performance trade-
oﬀs in applications even outside the context of social net-
works; this includes graph-theoretic detection mechanisms
for P2P botnets, spamming botnets, malicious online com-
munities, and malware [38, 42, 22, 53].
2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Motivating Applications. In this paper, our objective
is to enhance the security of social network based systems
by leveraging adaptive random walks. Existing security sys-
tems [12, 37, 34, 33, 52, 51] all adopt a ﬁxed-length random
walk scheme, where the random walk length is set as the

same suﬃciently large value (typically the mixing time of
the entire graph [25, 36]) for all walks to meet some system
requirements. However, the downside of the ﬁxed-length
based schemes is that a poor security-utility trade-oﬀ is in-
duced. Our key insight is that for large-scale social graphs,
the required random walk length to achieve a certain dis-
tance to stationarity has a heterogeneous and long-tail distri-
bution over diﬀerent starting nodes. By predicting an adap-
tive walk length for diﬀerent nodes, we are able to achieve
a better trade-oﬀ between the security and other properties
of social network based systems.
We mainly consider three social network based security
and privacy systems, including Sybil defense, anonymous
communication and link privacy preserving systems.
a) Sybil defenses. A Sybil attack is an attack wherein
a malicious user subverts the system by forging multiple
distinct identities. With a large number of fake identities
inserted by malicious users, the security of the system can be
severely sabotaged. To defend against Sybil attacks, many
defense mechanisms have been proposed by leveraging the
trust relationships in social networks [51, 52, 35, 24, 13, 44,
43, 5, 26]. For instance, SybilLimit [51] is a Sybil defense
protocol that performs random walk based routes on social
graphs and examines some conditions to detect Sybil users.
In SybilLimit, random walk is set as the mixing time [51] to
ensure that most benign users can be correctly veriﬁed, i.e.,
low false positives.
b) Anonymous communication. Anonymous commu-
nication systems such as Tor preserve user privacy by ob-
fuscating the correspondence between the user and the des-
tination communicating entity. Many anonymous system
designs [37, 34, 12, 15] that have been proposed in recent
years are built upon leveraging users’ trusted relationships,
and a typical one of them is the Pisces protocol [34]. Similar
to the Tor protocol, Pisces [34] provides low-latency anony-
mous communication by proxy servers and onion routing.
Random walks are performed on a social graph as the relay
selection method to create onion routing paths. An impor-
tant metric to quantify the level of provided anonymity is
the Shannon entropy, which can be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
by the length of random walks.
c) Link privacy. Social trust has been playing a crucial
role in various applications in many ﬁelds. To avoid reveal-
ing the sensitive information about users’ social relation-
ships, link privacy preserving systems provide a delicately
perturbed social graph to these applications by adding ex-
tra noise to the local structure of a social network. Mittal
et al. in [33] protected link privacy by replacing a real link
between two users with a fake link generated by a random
walk. The noise introduced to the graph increases as the
random walk length gets larger, ensuring stronger privacy.
Pitfalls of ﬁxed-length random walks. To achieve se-
curity/privacy guarantees, the length of random walks in the
above systems is required to be suﬃciently large. However,
long random walks enhance the security at the cost of sac-
riﬁcing other desirable properties of these applications. For
SybilLimit, the maximum number of Sybil users that can
be possibly misclassiﬁed as honest users increases propor-
tionally to the random walk length, indicating that longer
random walks result in a growing false negative rate. For
Pisces, extra latency is incurred for performing long random
walks, which degrades the performance of anonomous com-
munication. For a link privacy preserving system, the length
of random walks reﬂects the degree of introduced random-
ness to perturb the original graph. As the walk length in-
creases, the perturbed graph gets closer to a random graph,
resulting in the failure of utility guarantees.
For a ﬁxed-length random walk scheme, the length is typ-
ically set as the graph mixing time, which is the minimum
length for walks from every possible starting node to ap-
proach the stationarity. However, Mohaisen et al. showed
that the mixing time of social graphs is much larger than
anticipated [36], which implies that setting the walk length
globally as the same mixing time actually induces weaker
utility guarantees or less eﬃciency in these systems. Hence,
we develop SmartWalk to avoid unnecessarily long random
walks by properly adjusting the walk length for each node.
We demonstrate the applicability of SmartWalk in the above
three security systems by showing that up to two orders of
magnitude performance improvement can be achieved.
Formalizing local mixing time. We deﬁne the local
mixing time as a measure of the random walk length for a
speciﬁc node to achieve a certain distance to stationarity.
Using real-world large-scale social graphs, we observe that
it only takes a few hops for random walks starting from a
majority of nodes to approach the stationary distribution,
whereas there also exists a small group of nodes with a longer
local mixing time. This is due to the fact that random walk
length is closely related to the community structure within a
social network. Most of the communities are well-connected
