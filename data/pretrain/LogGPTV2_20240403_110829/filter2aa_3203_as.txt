The next-hop interface 
The next-hop interface is either a physical interface (for example, a network adapter) or a logical 
interface (for example, a tunneling interface) that IPv4 uses to forward the packet. 
After the next-hop address and interface are determined, the packet is passed to the Address 
Resolution Protocol (ARP) component of TCP/IP. For LAN technologies such as Ethernet and IEEE 
802.11, ARP attempts to resolve the link-layer address (also known as the MAC address) for the next-
hop address and forward the packet by using the next-hop interface. 
Contents of the IPv4 Routing Table 
The following are the fields of an IPv4 routing table entry for the TCP/IP component of Windows: 
Destination 
Can be either an IPv4 address or an IPv4 address prefix. For the IPv4 routing table of the TCP/IP 
component of Windows, this column is named Network Destination in the display of the route print 
command. 
Network Mask 
The prefix length expressed in subnet mask (dotted decimal) notation. The subnet mask is used to 
match the destination IPv4 address of the outgoing packet to the value in the Destination field. For 
the IPv4 routing table of the TCP/IP component of Windows, this column is named Netmask in the 
display of the route print command. 
Next-Hop 
The IPv4 address to which the packet is forwarded. For the IPv4 routing table of the TCP/IP 
component of Windows, this column is named Gateway in the display of the route print command. 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 125 
For direct deliveries, the Gateway column lists the IPv4 address assigned to an interface on the 
computer. 
Interface 
The network interface that is used to forward the IPv4 packet. For the IPv4 routing table of the 
TCP/IP component of Windows, this column contains an IPv4 address assigned to the interface. 
Metric 
A number used to indicate the cost of the route so that the best route, among potentially multiple 
routes to the same destination, can be selected. The metric can indicate either the number of links 
in the path to the destination or the preferred route to use, regardless of number of links. 
IPv4 routing table entries can store the following types of routes: 
Directly attached subnet routes 
For directly attached subnet routes, the Next-Hop field is the IPv4 address of the interface on that 
subnet. 
Remote subnet routes 
For remote subnet routes, the Next-Hop field is the IPv4 address of a neighboring router. 
Host routes 
For IPv4 host routes, the destination is a specific IPv4 address, and the network mask is 
255.255.255.255. 
Default route 
The default route is used when a more specific subnet or host route is not found. The default route 
destination is 0.0.0.0 with the network mask of 0.0.0.0. The next-hop address of the default route is 
typically the default gateway of the node. 
Route Determination Process 
IPv4 on a router uses the following process to determine which routing table entry to use for forwarding: 
1. For each entry in the routing table, IPv4 performs a bit-wise logical AND operation between the 
destination IPv4 address and the Network Mask field. The result is compared with the Destination 
field of the entry for a match. 
As described in Chapter 4, "IP Addressing," the result of the bit-wise logical AND operation is: 
For each bit in the subnet mask that is set to 1, copy the corresponding bit from the destination IPv4 
address to the result.  
For each bit in the subnet mask that is set to 0, set the corresponding bit in the result to 0. 
2. IPv4 compiles the list of matching routes and selects the route that has the longest match (that is, the 
route with the highest number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask). The longest matching route is the 
most specific route to the destination IPv4 address. If the router finds multiple routes with the longest 
matches (for example, multiple routes to the same address prefix), the router uses the lowest metric 
to select the best route. If multiple entries exist that are the longest match and the lowest metric, IPv4 
does the following: 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 126 
For Windows Server 2008 and later and Windows Vista and later, IPv4 can choose which 
routing table entry to use. 
For Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, IPv4 chooses the interface that is first in the 
binding order. 
On an IPv4 sending host, the entries in the routing table that are used for route determination depend 
on whether the host supports strong host send behavior. With strong host send behavior, the host can 
only send packets on an interface if the interface is assigned the source IPv4 address of the packet. For 
more information, see Strong and Weak Host Models. 
You can view and modify the binding order from Network Connections by clicking Advanced and then 
Advanced Settings. The binding order appears under Connections on the Adapters and Bindings 
tab, as Figure 5-2 shows. 
Figure 5-2  The binding order on the Adapters and Bindings tab 
When the route determination process is complete, IPv4 has selected a single route in the routing table. 
If this process fails to select a route, IPv4 indicates a routing error. A sending host internally indicates 
an IPv4 routing error to an upper layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP. A router sends an Internet 
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Destination Unreachable-Host Unreachable message to the sending 
host and discards the packet. 
Determining the Next-Hop Address and Interface 
After determining the single route in the routing table with which to forward the packet, IPv4 determines 
the next-hop address and interface from the following: 
If the address in the Next-Hop field is an address that is assigned to an interface on the forwarding 
node (a direct delivery): 
IPv4 sets the next-hop address to the destination IPv4 address of the IPv4 packet. 
IPv4 sets the next-hop interface to the interface that is assigned the address in the Interface field. 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 127 
If the address in the Next-Hop field is not an address that is assigned to an interface on the forwarding 
node (an indirect delivery): 
IPv4 sets the next-hop address to the IPv4 address in the Next-Hop field. 
IPv4 sets the next-hop interface to the interface that is assigned the address in the Interface field.

The display lists two interfaces. One interface corresponds to an installed network adapter (3Com 
EtherLink PCI), and the other is an internal loopback interface (MS TCP Loopback Interface). 
This routing table contains the following entries based on its configuration: 
The first entry, network destination of 0.0.0.0 and network mask (netmask) of 0.0.0.0 (/0), is the default 
route. Any destination IPv4 address that is bit-wise logically ANDed with 0.0.0.0 results in 0.0.0.0. 
Therefore, the default route is a match for any destination IPv4 address. If the default route is the 
longest matching route, the next-hop address is 157.60.136.1, and the next-hop interface is the network 
adapter that is assigned the IPv4 address 157.60.136.41 (the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter). 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 128 
The second entry, network destination of 127.0.0.0 and netmask of 255.0.0.0 (/8), is the loopback 
network route. For all packets that are sent to an address of the form 127.x.y.z, the next-hop address is 
set to 127.0.0.1 (the loopback address), and the next-hop interface is the interface that is assigned the 
address 127.0.0.1 (the MS TCP Loopback interface). 
The third entry, network destination of 157.60.136.0 and netmask of 255.255.252.0 (/22), is a directly 
attached subnet route. If this route is the longest matching route, the next-hop address is set to the 
destination address in the packet, and the next-hop interface is set to the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
The fourth entry, network destination of 157.60.136.41 and netmask of 255.255.255.255 (/32), is a host 
route for the IPv4 address of the host. For all IPv4 packets sent to 157.60.136.41, the next-hop address 
is set to 127.0.0.1, and the next-hop interface is the MS TCP Loopback interface. 
The fifth entry, network destination of 157.60.255.255 and netmask of 255.255.255.255 (/32), is a host 
route that corresponds to the all-subnets directed broadcast address for the class B address prefix 
157.60.0.0/16. For all IPv4 packets sent to 157.60.255.255, the next-hop address is set to 
157.60.255.255, and the next-hop interface is the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
The sixth entry, network destination of 224.0.0.0 and netmask of 240.0.0.0 (/4), is a route for multicast 
traffic that this host sends. For all multicast packets, the next-hop address is set to the destination 
address, and the next-hop interface is set to the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
The seventh entry, network destination of 255.255.255.255 and netmask of 255.255.255.255 (/32), is a 
host route that corresponds to the limited broadcast address. For all IPv4 packets sent to 
255.255.255.255, the next-hop address is set to 255.255.255.255, and the next-hop interface is the 
3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
The routes associated with the IPv4 address configuration are automatically assigned a metric of 20, 
based on the link speed of the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. For more information, see "Default Route 
Metric" in this chapter. 
The following are examples of how this routing table helps determine the next-hop IPv4 address and 
interface for several destinations: 
Unicast destination 157.60.136.48 
The longest matching route is the route for the directly attached subnet (157.60.136.0/22). The 
next-hop IPv4 address is the destination IPv4 address (157.60.136.48), and the next-hop interface 
is the network adapter that is assigned the IPv4 address 157.60.136.41 (the 3Com EtherLink PCI 
adapter). 
Unicast destination 192.168.0.79 
The longest matching route is the default route (0.0.0.0/0). The next-hop IPv4 address is the default 
gateway address (157.60.136.1), and the next-hop interface is the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
Multicast destination 224.0.0.1 
The longest matching route is the 224.0.0.0/4 route. The next-hop IPv4 address is the destination 
IP address (224.0.0.1), and the next-hop interface is the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
Subnet broadcast destination 157.60.139.255 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 129 
The longest matching route is the route for the directly attached subnet (157.60.136.0/22). The 
next-hop IPv4 address is the destination IPv4 address (157.60.139.255), and the next-hop interface 
is the 3Com EtherLink PCI adapter. 
Unicast destination 157.60.136.41 
The longest matching route is the host route for the locally assigned IPv4 address 
(157.60.136.41/32). The next-hop IPv4 address is the loopback address (127.0.0.1), and the next-
hop interface is the MS TCP Loopback interface. 
Static IPv4 Routing 
A static router uses manually configured routes to reach remote destinations. Figure 5-3 shows a 
simple static routing configuration. 
Figure 5-3  Simple static IPv4 routing configuration 
In Figure 5-3: 
Router A has only local connections to subnets 1 and 2. As a result, hosts on subnet 1 can 
communicate with hosts on subnet 2 but not with hosts on subnet 3. 
Router B has only local connections to subnets 2 and 3. Hosts on subnet 3 can communicate with hosts 
on subnet 2 but not with hosts on subnet 1. 
To route IPv4 packets to other subnets, you must configure each static router with one of the following: 
An entry in the routing table for each subnet prefix in the network. 
A default gateway address of a neighboring router. 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

Configuring Static IPv4 Routers 
Figure 5-4 shows an example of configuring entries in static routers for all subnet prefixes in the 
network. The routes in bold numbers were manually added to the routing tables of both routers. 
Figure 5-4  Example of static IPv4 routing entries 
In Figure 5-4: 
A static entry is created in the routing table for Router A with subnet 3’s subnet prefix (131.107.24.0/24) 
and the IP address (131.107.16.1) of the interface that Router A uses to forward packets from subnet 1 
to subnet 3. 
A static entry is created in the routing table for Router B with subnet 1’s subnet prefix (131.107.8.0/24) 
and the IP address (131.107.16.2) of the interface that Router B uses to forward packets from subnet 3 
to subnet 1. 
Dynamic IPv4 Routing 
With dynamic routing, routers automatically exchange routes to known networks with each other. If a 
route changes, routing protocols automatically update a router's routing table and inform other routers 
on the network of the change. Network administrators typically implement dynamic routing on large IP 
networks because it requires minimal maintenance. 
Figure 5-5 shows an example in which each router has automatically added a route for a remote subnet 
(in bold) by using dynamic routing. 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 131 
Figure 5-5  Example of dynamic IPv4 routing entries 
Dynamic routing for IPv4 requires an IPv4 routing protocol such as RIP, OSPF, or BGP-4. 
RIP 
RIP for IPv4 is a distance vector routing protocol that has its origins in the Xerox Network Services 
(XNS) version of RIP. This routing protocol became popular due to its inclusion in Berkeley UNIX 
(starting with BSD 4.2) as the RouteD server daemon. (A daemon is similar to a Windows service.) Two 
versions of RIP support IPv4. RFC 1058 defines RIP version 1 (v1), and RFC 1723 defines RIP version 
2 (v2).  
OSPF 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link state routing protocol that runs as an Interior Gateway 
Protocol (IGP) to a single autonomous system. In a link state routing protocol, each router maintains a 
database of router advertisements (LSAs). LSAs for routers within the AS consist of information about a 
router, its attached subnets, and their configured costs. An OSPF cost is a unitless metric that indicates 
the preference of using a link. Summarized routes and routes outside of the AS also have LSAs. RFC 
2328 defines OSPF. 
The router distributes its LSAs to its neighboring routers, which gather them into a database called the 
link state database (LSDB). By synchronizing LSDBs between all neighboring routers, each router has 
each other router's LSA in its database. Therefore, every router has the same LSDB. From the LSDB, 
OSPF calculates the entries for the router's routing table by determining the least cost path, which is the 
path with the lowest accumulated cost, to each subnet in the network. 
BGP-4 
Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4) is a path vector routing protocol that RFC 4271 defines. Unlike RIP 
and OSPF, which perform within an autonomous system, BGP-4 is designed to exchange information 
Chapter 5 – IP Routing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 132 
between autonomous systems. BGP-4 routing information is used to create a logical path tree, which 
describes all the connections between autonomous systems. The path tree information is then used to 
create loop-free routes in the routing tables of BGP-4 routers. BGP-4 messages use TCP port 179. 
BGP-4 is the primary inter-domain protocol used to maintain routing tables on the IPv4 Internet. 
Integrating Static and Dynamic Routing 
A static router does not exchange routing information with dynamic routers. To route from a static router 
through a dynamic router (such as an IPv4 router that is enabled for RIP or OSPF), you will need to add 
a static route to the routing tables on both the static and dynamic routers. As Figure 5-6 shows: 
To route packets from subnet 1 to the rest of the intranet, the routing table for Router A must include
