average trip. Our analysis shows that AVs do surprisingly well
per mission. Compared to airplanes (which utilize sophisticated
resilience models and techniques), AVs are merely 4.22× worse,
and are 2.5× better than surgical robots (see Table VIII).
However, if all cars are replaced by AVs in the future, the
AVs will make ∼ 96 billion trips per year [44], compared to the
9.6 million trips for airlines. This means that AVs will make
10, 000× more trips than airlines, leading to a higher number of
accidents per year than for airplanes. Further, the average length
of a mission in terms of time and miles covered is signiﬁcantly
different for airplanes and AVs. Hence a holistic comparison
across these systems would need to consider operational time
per mission, as well as account for competing failures across
concurrent deployments of these systems.
2) Traditional Reliability Metrics
While we have made an approximate comparison above,
the more traditional and accurate method for comparing the
resilience of AVs with that of airplanes (which are also highly
automated systems) is via operational hours to failure. That
metric, however, is unavailable for cars, since we do not
have information about the idle time for these vehicles or
its distribution. We propose an alternative metric based on the
number of miles driven to disengagement/accident. This metric
will be available across transportation systems.
To directly obtain this measure, there needs to be a small
change in the data collection by the DMV: manufacturers and
the DMV should collect data on miles between disengagements
per vehicle to enable the computation of the metrics.
VI. THREATS TO VALIDITY
An empirical study like ours is subject to vagaries arising
from heterogeneous data collection systems (e.g., the inclusion
or exclusion of data points, or the disparate information
content across data formats), thus hampering the ability to
draw generalized conclusions. Dealing with such issues is not
uncommon in the realm of system reliability assessment. We
assert the need for replication studies to verify our conclusions
across other datasets. We now discuss potential threats to
validity that are speciﬁcally related to our study.
Construct Validity implies that variables associated with
the study are measured correctly, i.e., that the measurements are
constructed in accordance with the theoretical foundations of
the area. We have discussed construct validity in Section V-C2.
Internal Validity implies that there are no systematic errors
and biases. We studied the datasets available from 12 different
manufacturers and only reported generalized trends in order

to eliminate any biases and micro-observations (observations
with low statistical signiﬁcance) that might be artifacts of
bad logging or biases from the manufactures in reporting the
disengagements and accidents. For example:
• Data underreporting: In order to obtain an AV testing
permit, companies are legally required to catalogue and
submit to the DMV reports of all disengagements and
accidents that 1) pertained to technology failures and safe
operation of the AVs, and 2) required the AV test driver to
disengage the autonomous mode and take immediate manual
control of the vehicle. The interpretation of “safe” operation
and technology “failure” can vary across manufacturers,
leading to underreporting. Further, regulatory oversight and
enforcement of regulations are difﬁcult and may result
in underreporting. Given the available data, we cannot
accurately estimate the scale of underreporting, and hence
refrain from drawing any such conclusions.
• Not all miles are equivalent: One manufacturer may hold the
tests of its AVs in more challenging environments than others
do, e.g., at night or during bad weather. Not all manufacturers
report environmental conditions during tests. Where available,
we report the testing conditions and disengagements caused
by environmental factors (see “Environment” in Fig. 6 ).
• Validity of fault tags and failure categories: There is no con-
sistent data format for the provided disengagement/accident
reports across manufacturers. Our NLP framework for
tagging and categorization may lead to systematic errors;
therefore, the dictionaries were veriﬁed manually by the
authors to ensure their correctness. We explicitly labeled
data points as “Unknown-T/C” when there was uncertainty
in the tags and categories given by the NLP framework.
External validity concerns the extent to which a study can
be generalized to other systems or datasets. To the best of
our knowledge, the CA DMV dataset is the only publicly
available dataset pertaining to AV failures. Until we work
with manufacturers on proprietary data (which might not be
disclosed publicly), we cannot comment on the general external
validity of the techniques presented here.
VII. RELATED WORK
The majority of the prior research into AV systems focuses
on the functionality of vehicle guidance systems. Numer-
ous demonstrations of end-to-end computing systems for
autonomous vehicles have recently been done (e.g., [2]–[7],
[45], [46]). The currently accepted practice for vehicular safety,
based on the ISO 26262 safety standard [47], is to consider
human drivers to have ultimate responsibility for safety. That
is the basis for most AV testing programs on public roads,
which require a safety driver to be in the vehicle to monitor the
vehicle. This driver is expected to intervene if a system failure
occurs that leads to a disengagement or accident; indeed, we
observe several such incidents in the CA DMV datatsets. In
such a scenario, safety considerations for the AV are driven
by 1) the AV’s ability to alert the driver in case of failure,
2) the driver’s ability to recognize the abilities of the AV and
the limits of the system, 3) the AV’s ability to anticipate the
behavior of other road users who might not always conform
to the rules, and 4) the other road user’s ability to anticipate
the behavior of the AV [48], [49]. How this will be handled in
596
autonomous vehicles remains an open question [50]. Safety is
also emphasized in a number of publications, including [51],
[52]. Waymo has published a report on the safety precautions
considered for their AVs [25].9
[36] provides a model to estimate the number of miles
AVs have to be driven to demonstrate their reliability with
statistical conﬁdence. [30], [34] provide summary statistics
(e.g., driver reaction times and AV speed in accident scenarios)
from tabulated data in the DMV dataset. Our approach uses an
STPA based ontology and NLP techniques (which in itself are
novel contributions of this work) to parse a signiﬁcant amount
of unstructured data presented as natural text.
[19] use fault injection to evaluate the fault tolerance of
deep neural networks (DNN: used primarily in the Sensor
Fusion & Environmental Information Processing step shown
in Fig. 3), analyze the DNN’s results, and propose techniques
to safeguard DNNs from single-event upsets. In contrast, we
present an analysis of the entire control system of the AV, of
which DNNs are a small part.
Other related work has focused on safety and reliability of
AVs as they apply to legal (e.g., [10], [11]) and regulatory bar-
riers (e.g., [12]–[15]) for AV deployment and implementation.
Security and privacy measures to encompass system-level
attacks and failures of AVs have also been studied [53], [54].
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
A steady march toward the use of AVs is clearly under
way. The reliability and safety challenges of fully-autonomous
vehicles (Level 4 & 5, currently under development) and today’s
semi-AVs are signiﬁcant and underestimated. We therefore draw
the following conclusions to frame our future research and
draw the attention of other reliability researchers.
• There is ongoing research on the veriﬁcation and validation
of the safety properties of individual system components
(e.g., the control, communication, and mechanical system
components) using the STAMP framework [51]. However,
our study shows there is a need for rigorous theoretical
models (like STPA models) for evaluating AV technologies.
• The machine learning systems responsible for perception
and control need further research and assessment under fault
conditions via stochastic modeling and fault injection to
augment data collection.
• In reality, there is a strong possibility that both AVs and
semi-AVs will co-exist with non-AVs (with human drivers
completely in charge) within several years. Therefore the
urgency of joint study driven by data and models needs to
be emphasized.
