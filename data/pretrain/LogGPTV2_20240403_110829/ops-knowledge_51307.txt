User: I am interested in getting some Python code talking to some Ruby code on Windows, Linux and possibly other platforms. Specificlly I would like to access classes in Ruby from Python and call their methods, access their data, create new instances and so on.
An obvious way to do this is via something like XML-RPC or maybe CORBA but I would be interested in any other approaches.
What have other people done to get code from Python and Ruby communicating with one another, either locally on the same system or remotely accross a network?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Expose your Ruby classes as web services using Sinatra, Rails, or, plain old Rack.
Expose your Python classes as web services using web.py, flask, Django, or App Engine.
Use HTTParty for Ruby to build an API into your Python classes.
Use a Python REST library to build an API into your Ruby classes.
