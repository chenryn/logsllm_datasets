CALL FOR PAPERS
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
“Knowledge and Data Engineering in the Semantic Web Era”
Special Issue Early 2007
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering seeks original manuscripts for a Special Issue on
Semantic Web and Information Systems scheduled to appear in an early 2007 issue. The Semantic Web vision
has evolved in the last years as a blueprint for a knowledge-based framework aimed at crossing the chasm
from the current Web of unstructured information resources to a Web equipped with metadata and oriented
to delegation of tasks to software agents. Ontologies are the key piece of this framework in that they provide
shared semantics to metadata, thus enabling a degree of semantic interoperability. The requirements of large-
scale deployment and interoperability of the Semantic Web vision represent a major challenge to data and
knowledge engineering, which raises a number of issues and requirements regarding how to represent, create,
manage and use both ontologies as shared knowledge representations, but also large volumes of metadata
records used to annotate Web resources of a diverse kind. The special issue aims at helping in communicating
and disseminating relevant recent research in knowledge and data engineering as applied to the context of
Information Systems. The scope of the call includes Knowledge Engineering for organizational applications,
Semantic Web approaches to Information Systems and Ontology-Based Information Systems research, as well
as the diverse underlying Database and Knowledge Representation aspects. Papers dealing with aspects that
touch both aspects are especially sought. This is intended to initiate a dialog between the organizational and
more technical views of the field. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Knowledge-based tools and techniques for or enabled by Semantic Web applications.
• How semantic mapping is achieved in databases and knowledge representations.
• Engineering of ontologies for Information Systems and their associated data management requirements.
• Algorithms and representations for Semantic Web approaches to Knowledge management.
• Knowledge integration through ontologies, semantic metadata and databases of annotations.
• Design and modeling of Semantic Web repositories and distributed knowledge-based systems.
• Semantic Web and metadata query languages and implementation frameworks.
• Management of semantic metadata.

An Interview with Richard Watson
President of the Association for Information Systems
“
If IS research has a context for this century, it
should be to tackle the problems that matter to
”
everyone
1. Miltiadis: Dear President Watson, I am delighted that you agreed to this interview. Let
me start with sharing a memory with you. A couple of years ago, I had a discussion with a
University Professor. I still remember a phrase: “Do you know how difficult is it to lead a whole
scientific community?” You are the right person to ask this same question: What does it really
mean to lead a discipline? What are the critical issues?
President Watson: I don’t think it is feasible to think of leading a discipline or a scientific
community. Indeed, such an idea is counter the idea of a community. Rather, I think the role of
the President of AIS is mainly a task of facilitation. I try to identify issues of importance to
AIS members and structure means of addressing them in a participative and open manner.
2. Miltiadis: Let me try to summarize your inspired leadership in the next questions. Undoubtedly, you and the AIS
council work very hard on the International Character of AIS. What are your key priorities or the most important
concerns towards this milestone?
President Watson: Priorities are often set by circumstances. In the last six months or so,
circumstances have dictated a focus on financial issues, and this is where Council has spent
most of its energy. Besides financial concerns, my priorities are to help scholars improve their
productivity and expand the global community of IS scholars. I have worked on
internationalization for some years and am currently writing a document laying out my ideas
for improving productivity.
3. Miltiadis: Dear President, we were really surprised by the financial difficulties of AIS, which you communicated
from the beginning of your presidency. The way you managed the issue seemed to me not only wise but also with
a long-term strategic perspective. What can we do, as AIS members to help with this problem?
President Watson: AIS Council needs its members’ understanding that financial problems
usually result in solutions that disappoint some members. For example, social events are likely
to be modest at future AMCIS and ICIS meetings. Thus, members can help by accepting that
some changes are necessary. In a very direct way, members can help by encouraging their
libraries to subscribe to JAIS and CAIS and encouraging non-members to join AIS.
4. Miltiadis: From time to time I hear from many researchers worldwide that the access ”publication opportunities”
to top IS journals is difficult. What do you think of the fact that each year we have a couple of hundreds articles in
top IS journals? Is this enough for the evolution of the IS discipline?
President Watson: I think we need more outlets for IS scholarship, and the project that I
mentioned earlier addresses this issue as one element of a system-wide improvement in the
academic publication system.

5. Miltiadis: Dear President, AIS has grown in the last years. Several chapters, SIGs, publications, etc. How
difficult is it for an International Association to promote its contribution to our society? What is the role of AIS
within the context of Knowledge Society?
President Watson: AIS, through its journals and conferences, has the task of fostering IS
research. I think it does this well, as demonstrated by the popularity of its conferences and
journals. It also has a role in influencing IS education, particularly for non-IS students. We
have gained recognition from AACSB as the voice for IS scholars, though I suspect our voice is
not as strong as other fields. However, AIS’s influence outside the US, though AACSB is
international, is limited. It is very much the role of local chapters to establish themselves as a
voice for IS scholars in their country.
Within the broader IS profession, AIS has little immediate influence. The information services
(e.g., Gartner) and consulting companies have far more impact on practice than scholars in the
short-term. However, through the many students we teach, we can influence practice, but it
takes time.
6. Miltiadis: What do you consider the top challenges for the MIS field?
President Watson: I think our research is too far removed from wealth creation and cutting
edge problem solving. I would like to see IS professors spinning off companies to market their
new ways of solving IS problems. I don’t think our current model of acceptable research favors
such action, and I believe that we should get closer to the action.
7. Miltiadis: It’s really true that AIS brings together people from all over the world. A whole community, enormous
knowledge exchanges. One of your key priorities, stated in your last letter to the IS community, is related to a
new information and knowledge infrastructure for members. What is your vision on this?
President Watson: I am still working on writing a paper describing this vision.
8. Miltiadis: Many members consider AIS to be a solid academic association. Do you share the opinion of some
people who claim that AIS must further exploit the synergies with the business world? Is this something that you
consider important?
President Watson: AIS has limited resources and needs to focus on core academic activities
(i.e., journals and conferences) to best serve its members. Given more resources, AIS could
enlarge its roles, but it would first need to determine members’ priorities. Some might argue
that AIS could do more for undergraduates (e.g., an honors society). There is always a case for
doing more, but at present I think AIS has its hands full with its journals and conferences.
9. Miltiadis: You have a personal research interest in u-business, open source, topics in the leading edge of
technologies and strategies. Do all these brand new approaches provide a new context for IS research in the
beginning of the new century?
Well, like most of my colleagues, I hope I am studying important topics. However, I am, to my
shame, ignoring the great problems of this century – global climate change, environmental
degradation, and diminishing biodiversity, as well as the persistent problems of poverty and
intolerance. If IS research has a context for this century, it should be to tackle the problems
that matter to everyone.

10. Miltiadis: Dear President, recently a lot of criticism was expressed against the required time for the completion of
a PhD in IS. What skills and competencies do you consider important enough to be pursued through PhD
programs in IS?
President Watson: PhD programs are about learning to think, and academic life is about
learning to be a better thinker. Surprisingly, it takes a lot of time to learn to think well, and I
am still working on it. My current thinking is that a PhD program is about the right length.
There are a lot of skills to be mastered to be a good thinker and much practice is required. You
need to be able to think about a problem in multiple ways to truly understand it before you can
think about multiple solutions.
11. Miltiadis: Recently I had a conversation with a colleague who serves as CEO in a big IT company. He told me
something that is typical of practitioners: In few words, he emphasized the gap between theoretical propositions
and business practice. Do you share this opinion?
President Watson: Business is theory in practice. Practitioners act based on their implicit
theories of how customers, competitors, etc. will react to their actions. We live and act in a
world of causal predictions based on our beliefs (i.e., theories) about how others behave and
react. The problem is that many times the theories we use lead to poor predictions. If there is a
gap, it is the gap between the theory applied and the right theory to apply. Academics need to
help practitioners to close this gap.
12. Miltiadis: Dear President, how do you evaluate the cooperation of AIS with other leading associations like IEEE,
INFORMS etc? Do you think that in the next years we will experience closer collaboration?
President Watson: My priorities would be to develop more AIS chapters and ensure closer
collaboration between AIS and its chapters and among chapters. I think we need to build out
our community to embrace all IS scholars.
13. Miltiadis: Dear President, from Australia to USA, with an excellent career and academic record. How do you
view the benefits of globalization? Do we have to be more socially concerned, especially for continents such as
Africa or Latin America where IS as a field is still in its developing stage?
President Watson: I teach a course called “Globalization and IT” that generally has a positive
view on globalization because of my belief in the power of markets to allocate scarce resources
and limit the power of politicians. In some ways we don’t have enough of the free trade on
which globalization rides. If the US and Europe ceased their massive subsidies of agriculture,
many of the developing countries would have an opportunity to grow richer through
agricultural exports.
AIS has had a policy for some years of offering its e-library without charge to scholars in the
non-rich countries. We also give a significant membership discount to IS scholars in these
countries.
I have for some time thought that we should work on developing a pairing system of matching
scholars in different countries to encourage the flow of knowledge between the developed and
undeveloped regions. A few years ago, I tried to get the US Congress to fund an electronic peace
corps to implement this idea. Unfortunately, the senator who agreed to sponsor the idea died.
14. Miltiadis: Lately, a lot of discussion concerned the decision to change the hosting of ICIS 2006. To be honest, I
think that there were some differences in the way of thinking between Europeans and USA located IS researchers.
What are the key actions towards a “shared vision and language” for the IS community worldwide?
38
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
President Watson: A community is not a like a business, I think it would be dangerous to have
a single vision of IS. In fact, as I have spoken to different chapters, I have encouraged them to
develop a distinctive IS identity and approach to IS research. In a world of continually
changing problems, diversity is an asset.
15. Miltiadis: Lately we can see initiatives for extensive knowledge sharing in several communities. E.g. the Open
Knowledge Initiative, SAKAI projects in US, Networks of Excellence in Europe etc. Is it possible to see such
movements initiated by AIS in the next years?
President Watson: I think projects of this level are beyond AIS’s resources. However, AIS
should probably take action to ensure that its members are aware of these initiatives (e.g., a
panel at ICIS or a special issue of JAIS).
16. Miltiadis: Dear President, you are supporting a number of conferences and workshops worldwide. You were in
Tunisia last year. Is this a critical bet towards the expansion of our community? Do you see any virtual
opportunities for e-learning initiated by AIS worldwide?
President Watson: As I said earlier, I think it is important that we build the global IS
community over the next few years. Hence, last year I visited six continents and on most of my
visits sought opportunities to encourage the formation of chapters and involvement in AIS.
AIS is in the e-learning sector for academics with ISWorld, the ISWorld listserv, and e-library.
We make it possible for our members to learn from each other and support the accumulation of
knowledge. We have probably done more than most academic societies in this regard, and so
we should as we are IS scholars.
I see some new opportunities to further develop e-learning for academics but my thoughts need
further work.
17. Miltiadis: Dear President, would you like to share with our readers a book or an article that you recently read and
made a great impact on you?
President Watson: My elder daughter is working on a PhD in developmental biology, and I
have been reading quite a lot in this area of the last few years. Mainly, because she gives me as
gifts books that she wants to read. I found Steven Pinker’s “The Blank Slate” very useful for
understanding human information processing. As a result, I think there is a need to link IS and
evolutionary biology to gain a deeper understanding of how humans process information and
the features of the information systems they build.
18. Miltiadis: European IS community versus American IS community. Do you believe there are areas and issues
that differentiate these two communities?
President Watson: I certainly hope that there are areas and issues differentiating these
communities and IS communities within each of these regions. Monocultures are dangerous,
especially for academics, because they constrain thinking and innovation. My observation
from at least 20 visits to Europe is that there is no imminent threat of a monoculture.
19. Miltiadis: Any thoughts you would care to share on the formation of the New Special Interest Group on Semantic
Web and Information Systems on AIS?
President Watson: SIGs in general have been a key development of AIS over the last few years.
I think the SIG on Semantic Web and Information Systems exemplifies the energy and vitality
of many SIGs. The SIGs are key action and innovation centers in AIS. They are organizing new
conferences, tracks in existing conferences, web sites, newsletters, and globally connecting
