## Expected Behavior
The color which is supplied in palette.text.primary value doesn't seem to do
anything.  
I was hoping that when I pass that value then that color will be used for
every component which has color value set to primary. But it seems that every
component decides on the text color on its own by using the getContrastText
mixin.
I understand there is a way to override this using "overrides" while creating
a theme. But that would require overriding a lot for me as I want this thing
to be user controlled through preferences.
May be I am just understanding it wrongly. My main question is that if the
value passed under palette.text.primary is used at all ?
## Context
I am trying to make a user controlled look and feel where the user will be
able to choose from several predefined color schemes I provide in the
application
