Hi, I recently upgraded to `atom-0.184.0` and the required `atom-
shell-0.22.3`. All works remarkably well, considering how severe the one thing
that does _not_ is:
Almost always (though strangely enough not really always) atom crashes
whenever I try to copy something into its window. Not only that, but even if I
have saved a file in a ~5s time window before the crash, it will undo whatever
save that was :-/ This is not as far as I can tell contingent on what it is
that I copy or where it is copied from.
This is seriously annoying! And sadly I can't seem to debug it , atom
automatically detaches itself from the terminal so that I do not see any
output...
