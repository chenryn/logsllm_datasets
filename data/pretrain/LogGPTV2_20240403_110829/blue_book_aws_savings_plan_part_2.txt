For example, a `t2.medium` instance has a normalization factor of `2`. If you purchase a `t2.medium` default tenancy Amazon Linux/Unix Reserved Instance in the US East (N. Virginia) and you have two running `t2.small` instances in your account in that Region, the billing benefit is applied in full to both instances.
Or, if you have one `t2.large` instance running in your account in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, the billing benefit is applied to 50% of the usage of the instance.
Limitations:
- *Supported*: Instance size flexibility is only supported for Regional Reserved Instances.
- *Not supported*: Instance size flexibility is not supported for the following Reserved Instances:
    - Reserved Instances that are purchased for a specific Availability Zone (zonal Reserved Instances)
    - Reserved Instances for G4ad, G4dn, G5, G5g, and Inf1 instances
    - Reserved Instances for Windows Server, Windows Server with SQL Standard, Windows Server with SQL Server Enterprise, Windows Server with SQL Server Web, RHEL, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
    - Reserved Instances with dedicated tenancy
## [Examples of applying reserved instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/apply_ri.html)
### Scenario 1: Reserved Instances in a single account
You are running the following On-Demand Instances in account A:
- 4 x `m3.large` Linux, default tenancy instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a
- 2 x `m4.xlarge` Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in Availability Zone us-east-1b
- 1 x `c4.xlarge` Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in Availability Zone us-east-1c
You purchase the following Reserved Instances in account A:
- 4 x `m3.large` Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a (capacity is reserved)
- 4 x `m4.large` Amazon Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in Region us-east-1
- 1 x `c4.large` Amazon Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instances in Region us-east-1
The Reserved Instance benefits are applied in the following way:
- The discount and capacity reservation of the four `m3.large` zonal Reserved Instances is used by the four `m3.large` instances because the attributes (instance size, Region, platform, tenancy) between them match.
- The `m4.large` regional Reserved Instances provide Availability Zone and instance size flexibility, because they are regional Amazon Linux Reserved Instances with default tenancy.
  An `m4.large` is equivalent to 4 normalized units/hour.
  You've purchased four `m4.large` regional Reserved Instances, and in total, they are equal to `16` normalized units/hour (4x4). Account A has two `m4.xlarge` instances running, which is equivalent to `16` normalized units/hour (2x8). In this case, the four `m4.large` regional Reserved Instances provide the full billing benefit to the usage of the two `m4.xlarge` instances.
  The `c4.large` regional Reserved Instance in us-east-1 provides Availability Zone and instance size flexibility, because it is a regional Amazon Linux Reserved Instance with default tenancy, and applies to the `c4.xlarge` instance. A `c4.large` instance is equivalent to `4` normalized units/hour and a `c4.xlarge` is equivalent to `8` normalized units/hour.
  In this case, the `c4.large` regional Reserved Instance provides partial benefit to `c4.xlarge` usage. This is because the `c4.large` Reserved Instance is equivalent to `4` normalized units/hour of usage, but the `c4.xlarge` instance requires `8` normalized units/hour. Therefore, the `c4.large` Reserved Instance billing discount applies to 50% of `c4.xlarge` usage. The remaining `c4.xlarge` usage is charged at the On-Demand rate.
### Scenario 2: Reserved Instances in a single account using the normalization factor
You are running the following On-Demand Instances in account A:
- 2 x `m3.xlarge` Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a
- 2 x `m3.large` Amazon Linux, default tenancy instances in Availability Zone us-east-1b
You purchase the following Reserved Instance in account A:
- 1 x `m3.2xlarge` Amazon Linux, default tenancy Reserved Instance in Region us-east-1
The Reserved Instance benefits are applied in the following way:
- The `m3.2xlarge` regional Reserved Instance in us-east-1 provides Availability Zone and instance size flexibility, because it is a regional Amazon Linux Reserved Instance with default tenancy. It applies first to the `m3.large` instances and then to the `m3.xlarge` instances, because it applies from the smallest to the largest instance size within the instance family based on the normalization factor.
- An `m3.large` instance is equivalent to `4` normalized units/hour.
- An `m3.xlarge` instance is equivalent to `8` normalized units/hour.
- An `m3.2xlarge` instance is equivalent to `16` normalized units/hour.
The benefit is applied as follows:
The `m3.2xlarge` regional Reserved Instance provides full benefit to 2 x `m3.large` usage, because together these instances account for `8` normalized units/hour. This leaves `8` normalized units/hour to apply to the `m3.xlarge` instances.
With the remaining `8` normalized units/hour, the `m3.2xlarge` regional Reserved Instance provides full benefit to 1 x `m3.xlarge` usage, because each `m3.xlarge` instance is equivalent to `8` normalized units/hour. The remaining `m3.xlarge` usage is charged at the On-Demand rate.
# [Standard or convertible reserved instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-reservation-models/standard-vs.-convertible-offering-classes.html)
When you purchase a Reserved Instance, you can choose between a Standard or Convertible offering class. 
- Standard Reserved Instance: Enables you to modify Availability Zone, scope, networking type, and instance size (within the same instance type) of your Reserved Instance.
- Convertible Reserved Instance:  Enables you to exchange one or more Convertible Reserved Instances for another Convertible Reserved Instance with a different configuration, including instance family, operating system, and tenancy.
  There are no limits to how many times you perform an exchange, as long as the target Convertible Reserved Instance is of an equal or higher value than the Convertible Reserved Instances that you are exchanging.
Standard Reserved Instances typically provide the highest discount levels. One-year Standard Reserved Instances provide a similar discount to three-year Convertible Reserved Instances. 
Convertible Reserved Instances are useful when:
- Purchasing Reserved Instances in the payer account instead of a subaccount. You can more easily modify Convertible Reserved Instances to meet changing needs across your organization.
- Workloads are likely to change. In this case, a Convertible Reserved Instance enables you to adapt as needs evolve while still obtaining discounts and capacity reservations.
- You want to hedge against possible future price drops.
- You can’t or don’t want to ask teams to do capacity planning or forecasting.
- You expect compute usage to remain at the committed amount over the commitment period.
# [Monitoring the savings plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/sp-monitoring.html)
Monitoring is an important part of your Savings Plans usage. Understanding the
Savings Plan that you own, how they are applying to your usage, and what usage
is being covered are important parts of optimizing your costs with Savings
Plans. You can monitor your usage in multiple forms.
* [Using the
    inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/ce-sp-inventory.html):
    The Savings Plans Inventory page shows a detailed overview of the Savings
    Plans that you own, or have queued for future purchase.
    To view your Inventory page:
    * Open the [AWS Cost Management
        console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).
    * In the navigation pane, under Savings Plans, choose Inventory.
* [Using the utilization
    report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/ce-sp-usingPR.html):
    Savings Plans utilization shows you the percentage of your Savings Plans
    commitment that you're using across your On-Demand usage. You can use your
    Savings Plans utilization report to visually understand how your Savings
    Plans apply to your usage over the configured time period. Along with
    a visualized graph, the report shows high-level metrics based on your
    selected Savings Plan, filters, and lookback periods. Utilization is
    calculated based on how your Savings Plans applied to your usage over the
    lookback period.
    For example, if you have a 10 $/hour commitment, and your usage billed with
    Savings Plans rates totals to $9.80 for the hour, your utilization for that
    hour is 98 percent.
    You can find high-level metrics in the Utilization report section:
    * *On-Demand Spend Equivalent*: The amount you would have spent on the same
        usage if you didn’t commit to Savings Plans. This amount is the
        equivalent On-Demand cost based on current On-Demand rates.
    * *Savings Plans spend*: Your Savings Plans commitment spend over the
        lookback period.
    * *Total Net Savings*: The amount you saved using Savings Plans commitments
        over the selected time period, compared to the On-Demand cost estimate.
    To access your utilization report:
    * Open the [AWS Cost Management
        console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).
    * On the navigation pane, choose Savings Plans.
    * In the left pane, choose Utilization report.
* [Using the coverage
    report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/ce-sp-usingCR.html):
    The Savings Plans coverage report shows how much of your eligible spend was
    covered by your Savings Plans and how much is not covered by either Savings plan or Reserved instances based on the selected time period. 
    You can find the following high-level metrics in the Coverage report section:
    * *Average Coverage*: The aggregated Savings Plans coverage percentage based
        on the selected filters and look-back period.
    * *Additional potential savings*: Your potential savings amount based on
        your Savings Plans recommendations. This is shown as a monthly amount.
    * *On-Demand spend not covered*: The amount of eligible savings spend that
        was not covered by Savings Plans or Reserved Instances over the lookback
        period.
    To access your utilization report:
    * Open the [AWS Cost Management
        console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).
    * On the navigation pane, choose Savings Plans.
    * In the left pane, choose Coverage report.
    The columns are a bit tricky:
    * "Spend covered by Savings Plan": Refers to the on demand usage amount that you would have paid on demand that is being covered by the Savings Plans. Not the Savings Plan amount that is applied to on demand usage.
    The coverage report of the reserved instances has the same trick on the columns:
    * "Reservation covered hours": the column does not refer to your RI hours. This column refers to your on demand hours that was covered by Reserved Instances.
- Using the Reserved Instance Coverage report: In this report the column "Reservation covered hours" is also misleading as it does not refer to your Reserved instance hours. It refers to your on demand hours that was covered by Reserved Instances.
# Doing your savings plan
Important notes when doing a savings plan:
- Always use the reservation rates instead of the on-demand rates!
- Analyze your coverage reports. You don't want to have many points of 100% coverage as it means that you're using less resources than you've reserved. On the other hand it's fine to sometimes use less resources than the reserved if that will mean a greater overall savings. It's a tight balance.
- The Savings plan reservation is taken into account at hour level, not at month or year level. That means that if you reserve 1$/hour of an instance type and you use for example 2$/hour half the day and 0$/hour half the day, you'll have a 100% coverage of your plan the first hour and another 1$/hour of on-demand infrastructure cost for the first part of the day. On the second part of the day you'll have a 0% coverage. This means that you should only reserve the amount of resources you plan to be using 100% of the time throughout your savings plan. Again you may want to overcommit a little bit, reducing the utilization percentage of a plan but getting better savings in the end.
Go to the [AWS savings plan
simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/) and check the
different instances you were evaluating.
