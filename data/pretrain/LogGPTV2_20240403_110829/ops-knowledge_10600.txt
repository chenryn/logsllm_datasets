User: I install to virtualenv, yet it still runs the versions from C:\Python27\site-packages or C:\Python34\site-packages.  When I try to install with pip in my venv I get already installed and the location is the global site-packages.
Any idea why that could be??
Also my virtualenv wrapper commands work but when i do workon X it doesn't activate the venv.  
OS is win7.  But the problem occurred on powershell and git bash.
Thanks
Assistant: Seems by realiasing pip and starting over and using --force-installed to install everything all over (including venv) it worked.
