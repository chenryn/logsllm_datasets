WELCOME FROM CHAIRS 
It  is  time  for  us  to  welcome  you  to  the  Third  Workshop  on 
Forming an Ecosystem Around Software Transformation (FEAST 
2018)! This year’s workshop is held in conjunction with the 25th 
ACM  Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications  Security 
(CCS) on October 19th, 2018 in Toronto, Canada. As always, the 
workshop  is  geared  toward  discussion  and  understanding  of 
several 
software 
transformation  for  improving  the  security  and  efficiency  of  all 
software  used  in  security-critical  applications.  The  scope  of 
discussion  for  this  workshop  will  include  topics  that  may  be 
necessary  to  fully  explore  the  power  and  impact  of  late-stage 
software customization efforts, on binary code and beyond. The 
call for papers attracted strong submissions from both academy 
and  industry.  In  total,  we  accepted  5  full  technical  papers,  and 
augmented  them  with  a  number  of  exciting  invited  talks,  short 
talks, and planned discussions.  
   Putting together FEAST’18 is a team effort, and we could not 
have done it without the authors (and their excellent submissions), 
the  program  committee  (for  their  insightful  reviews),  and  the 
Office of Naval Research for the creation of this workshop in the 
first place. We are excited about this workshop, and we are sure 
that  you  will  be  as  well!  Please  enjoy  the  programs,  the 
discussions, and the resulting spread and creation of new ideas!
