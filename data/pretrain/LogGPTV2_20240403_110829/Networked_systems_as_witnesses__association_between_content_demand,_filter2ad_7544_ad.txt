mand (from school and non-school networks) and COVID-
19 incidence (lag is the same for both networks). Schools are
ordered by the correlation coefficient, in descending order.
By exploring a single state in the study, the authors expect to
remove other potential variables that could skew the trends such
as weather [64], racial, and economic inequality [38], the timing
and extent of community mitigation measures, diagnostic testing
capacity and public health reporting practices [17]. We compared
the population density of mask mandated and nonmandated coun-
ties considering the importance of density in predicting cumulative
COVID-19 cases in the US [69]. While both mask-mandated and
nonmandated sets include high and low densely populated coun-
ties, most of the mask-mandated ones are among the top-30 most
densely populated counties in the state (14 out of 24), with less
than 20% of nonmandated counties making it to the list (16 out
of 81). Moreover, previous works, e.g. [55], suggest that temper-
ature has an effect on the prevalence of COVID-19 which makes
it more suitable to compare two locations with similar average
temperatures.
In our analysis, we compare the time periods of June 1 to July 3,
2020 (when the state mask mandate became effective), with that of
July 4 to July 31, 2020. The counties are compared to themselves over
time thus avoiding the impact of confounding variables on the study,
e.g. income or population density. Following Van Dyke et al. [67], we
divide the counties between those with and without mask mandates,
that is counties that opted out of the state mandate and did not
adopt a mask mandate of their own as of August 11, 2020. We further
divide the counties in those with high CDN demand and those with
low CDN demand. For this, we calculate the percentage difference of
CDN demand from a baseline value in January; this yields a value in
the range of [-200,200] for each day, with a negative (positive) value

meaning a decrease (increase) in CDN demand usage compared
to the baseline period. We define high CDN demand as a positive
demand value (in (0 − 200]) and low CDN demand as a no-positive
(negative or zero) demand value (in [−200, 0]). We opted for this
discretization of CDN demand to better match the study we extend.
We obtained the data on county mask mandates from the Kansas
Health Institute. As in the previous section and consistent with
Van Dyke et al.[67], we use COVID-19 Incidence per county (daily
county-level cases per 100,000), from the JHU CSSE COVID-19
repository [41], and apply a rolling 7-day average on it.
Figure 5 presents trends in 7-day average of COVID-19 per
100,000 population. The figure, modeled after Van Dyke et al. [67],
gives a visual representation of the trend of cases before and af-
ter the mask mandate (July 3, 2020). July 3 is represented by the
black dotted line in the figure. We use segmented regression to find
changes in the trend of the pandemic before and after the mask
mandate. The slopes of the regression lines are mentioned in Table 4.
The figure shows a steep drop in the trend of COVID-19 incidence
for the mask-mandated counties that have high demand, quantified
by the slope of -0.71 obtained through regression. This compared
to -0.1 for nonmandated counties with high demand shows the
impact that masks have on reducing the spread of the pandemic.
Counties with no mask mandates and low demand have the highest
Covid Incidence slope of 0.19 for the month of July. The analysis
suggests that, while mask mandates can help reduce the rate of
infection (top-right figure), the combined interventions (top-left)
are clearly effective at significantly reducing the spread. Besides
further illustrating the potential value of CDN demand as a proxy
of social distancing, the analysis may help explain, at least in part,
some of the variability observed in the correlation between CDN
demand and infections cases in the previous sections.
Limitations. We inherit some of the limitations of the study we
extend. As Van Dyke et al. [67], the experimental design and the
limited information on the implementation of the mandates and
community mask-wearing behaviors limit the ability to determine
the extent to which the mask mandates accounted for the observed
declines in COVID-19 incidence. Second, although the design limits
potential confounding from constant county-related characteristics,
the findings are conditional on the absence of some time-varying
factors, such as access to testing, within counties around the effec-
tive date of the mandate. Nonetheless, as Van Dyke et al. [67] we
find that, while testing rates were observed to increase overall over
time, these studies observed decreases in COVID-19 incidence in
mandated and high CDN demand counties after July 3.
8 LIMITATIONS
We acknowledge several limitations of this study, to help put our
findings in perspective.
• While we control for known confounding factors using natu-
ral experiment designs [8, 20, 23, 44], there may be additional
confounding factors for which we have not accounted (e.g.,
party affiliation). Despite this, the consistency of our find-
ings with those of prior work increases confidence in our
approach.
• In addition, we would expect that, over time, the introduc-
tion of other pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical inter-
ventions, changes in the level of compliance with different
measures, and the growing fraction of people with active
immunity (vaccine-induced or through infection with the ac-
tual disease) will further complicate this and similar studies.
• Our analysis is limited to counties in the US. Beyond the
challenges of analyzing such complex interactions across
countries (with different political systems, health infrastruc-
ture, cultural norms, etc.), the distributed decision-making
process resulted in a highly variable mitigation response
which, combined with variable enforcement, challenges this
type of analysis while, at the same time, offering the oppor-
tunity for natural experiments, as otherwise similar counties
opted for diametrically different responses [67].
• The data we rely on does not include sociodemographic infor-
mation and it might not representatively capture all groups,
such as older adults, individuals with chronic diseases, or
low-income groups for whom social distancing might be
difficult to maintain or Internet access hard to afford.
• In addition, the completeness and accuracy of the JHU data-
base with respect to COVID-19 incidence has not been es-
tablished. This database aggregates publicly available data
whose accuracy may vary from state to state. As with limita-
tions in testing, inconsistencies in reporting are unavoidable
limitations of all COVID-19 US population-based studies.
• Finally our analysis is descriptive looking at the associa-
tion between mobility, CDN demand, and COVID-19 trans-
mission. Deriving statistical models that could be used for
prediction is left as future work [4].
9 RELATED WORK
In this section, we examine prior work on COVID-19 with a focus on
the interaction between human behavior during the pandemic and
the networked systems they use. More specifically, we review prior
efforts from the networking community exploring changes in user
mobility and networks’ and systems’ demand during the pandemic.

S. Asif et al.
We also review work from the health sciences that leverages mobile
user data to evaluate the effectiveness of different NPIs.
Previous studies have looked at how changes in people’s social
behavior due to the pandemic have also changed their network
usage patterns. The pandemic has lead to unprecedented changes
in social interaction and increased pressure on the Internet. Lutu et
al. [46] describe how different aspects of network usage, including
cellular data volume and average radio load, have changed since
the pandemic started. Feldmann et al. [27] present an analysis of
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from a large and diverse set
of vantage points. Boettger et al. [9] explore this effect from the
vantage point of a global social network.
Several efforts, particularly in epidemiology and public health,
have relied on aggregated and anonymized cell phone data to esti-
mate the degree of social distancing [2, 4, 43] and the effectiveness of
related interventions [11, 59]. Asweto et al. [2] use Google CMR data
to estimate the level of transmission reduction in 26 African coun-
tries as a result of different NPIs aimed at containing the disease,
finding that both mobility changes in public spaces and residential
are significant predictors of COVID-19 cases. Kephart et al. [43] use
aggregated mobile phone location data, confirmed COVID-19 cases,
and features of urban and social environments to analyze popula-
tion mobility and COVID-19 incidence at the sub-city level among
314 cities in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico.
Among their findings, the authors report that a 10% lower weekly
mobility was associated with 8.6% lower incidence of COVID-19
in the following week. Badr et al. [4] rely on anonymized mobility
data to study the correlation between the growth rate of infection
and mobility, finding that mobility patterns are strongly correlated
with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected
counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0.7
for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Two closely related studies show
that public interest in COVID-19, as captured by relative search
popularity in Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter, can be used
in the assessment of social distancing measures [70] and correlates
with the number of newly reported COVID-19 cases [24].
Others have suggested the idea of networked systems as wit-
nesses of large-scale global events. Cardona et al. [12] describe the
correlation between traffic demand and weather conditions. Bischof
et al. [7] explore how the popularity of a peer-to-peer system like
BitTorrent is impacted by events like natural disasters (2011 earth-
quake and tsunami in Tohoku, Japan). Dainotti et al. [19] use BGP
routing data, traceroute measurements, and Internet Background
Radiation (IBR) traffic to understand how large-scale censorship
events took place.
10 CONCLUSION
We argued that the pervasiveness of networked systems in daily life
gives them a unique perspective on our individual and collective
actions. We leveraged this perspective by studying the relationships
between user mobility, content demand and the spread of COVID-19.
We used publicly available datasets of user mobility to demonstrate
that changes in CDN demand are strongly correlated with social
distancing behavior. We then built on this, using CDN demand as a
proxy of social distancing, to show that increased social distancing
is strongly correlated with decreasing growth rates of infection.
498
We used university campus closures to explore the relationship
between inter-region mobility, CDN demand, and the incidence
of COVID-19 infections. Last, we extended prior work studying
the effectiveness of mask mandates and show the combined ben-
efits of social distancing and mask mandates. Demonstrating the
effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions requires a better
understanding of compliance with such measures. The use of mo-
bile phone data for evaluating COVID-19 responses raises issues
with the potential sources and implications of selection bias in mo-
bile phone data [33]. The aggregated view of networked system
demand offers a promising alternative.
