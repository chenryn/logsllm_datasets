### Table 3: Distance Correlation Coefficients
The table below presents the distance correlation coefficients between lagged demand (from school and non-school networks) and COVID-19 incidence. The lag is consistent for both networks, and schools are ordered by the correlation coefficient in descending order.

### Methodology and Context

By focusing on a single state, the authors aim to control for other potential variables that could influence the trends, such as weather [64], racial and economic inequality [38], community mitigation measures, diagnostic testing capacity, and public health reporting practices [17]. To further refine the analysis, we compared the population density of counties with and without mask mandates, given the importance of density in predicting cumulative COVID-19 cases in the US [69]. Most mask-mandated counties (14 out of 24) are among the top-30 most densely populated, while only 20% of nonmandated counties (16 out of 81) fall into this category. Additionally, previous studies, such as [55], suggest that temperature affects the prevalence of COVID-19, making it important to compare locations with similar average temperatures.

### Time Periods and Data Sources

Our analysis compares two time periods: June 1 to July 3, 2020 (before the state mask mandate became effective), and July 4 to July 31, 2020 (after the mandate). By comparing counties to themselves over time, we minimize the impact of confounding variables like income or population density. Following the methodology of Van Dyke et al. [67], we categorize counties based on whether they adopted the state mask mandate. We also classify counties by high and low Content Delivery Network (CDN) demand. For this, we calculate the percentage difference in CDN demand from a baseline value in January, resulting in a range of [-200, 200] for each day. A negative value indicates a decrease in CDN demand, while a positive value indicates an increase. High CDN demand is defined as a positive value (0 to 200), and low CDN demand is defined as a non-positive value (-200 to 0).

### Table 4: Trends in COVID-19 Incidence

The table below shows the slopes of the trends in COVID-19 incidence in mask-mandated and nonmandated counties in Kansas, with high and low CDN demand, before and after the state mask mandate became effective on July 3, 2020.

| Counties | Before Mandate | After Mandate |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Mandated - High CDN Demand | 0.33          | 0.43          |
| Mandated - Low CDN Demand  | 0.19          | 0.12          |
| Nonmandated - High CDN Demand | -0.71        | 0.05          |
| Nonmandated - Low CDN Demand | -0.1         | 0.19          |

### Visual Analysis

Figure 5 provides a visual representation of the 7-day average of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. The black dotted line marks July 3, 2020, the date the mask mandate took effect. Segmented regression was used to identify changes in the trend of the pandemic before and after the mandate. The slopes of the regression lines are listed in Table 4. The figure shows a significant drop in the trend of COVID-19 incidence for mask-mandated counties with high demand, quantified by a slope of -0.71. This is in contrast to nonmandated counties with high demand, which have a slope of -0.1, highlighting the impact of masks in reducing the spread of the virus. Counties without mask mandates and low demand have the highest COVID-19 incidence slope of 0.19 for July. The analysis suggests that while mask mandates can help reduce infection rates, the combined interventions (top-left) are more effective at significantly reducing the spread. This further illustrates the potential value of CDN demand as a proxy for social distancing.

### Limitations

We acknowledge several limitations of our study:
- **Confounding Factors:** While we control for known confounding factors using natural experiment designs [8, 20, 23, 44], there may be additional unaccounted factors (e.g., party affiliation). However, the consistency of our findings with prior work increases confidence in our approach.
- **Interventions Over Time:** The introduction of other pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, changes in compliance, and the growing fraction of people with active immunity (vaccine-induced or through infection) will complicate future studies.
- **Geographic Limitations:** Our analysis is limited to counties in the US. Analyzing such complex interactions across countries with different political systems, health infrastructures, and cultural norms poses significant challenges.
- **Data Representation:** The data does not include sociodemographic information and may not represent all groups, such as older adults, individuals with chronic diseases, or low-income groups.
- **Data Accuracy:** The completeness and accuracy of the JHU CSSE COVID-19 repository have not been fully established, and inconsistencies in reporting are unavoidable.

### Related Work

Prior research has explored the interaction between human behavior during the pandemic and networked systems. Studies have examined changes in user mobility and network demand, as well as the use of mobile phone data to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). For example, Lutu et al. [46] and Feldmann et al. [27] describe changes in network usage patterns, while Asweto et al. [2] and Kephart et al. [43] use mobile phone data to estimate the degree of social distancing and its effectiveness. Other studies, such as Badr et al. [4], show strong correlations between mobility patterns and decreased COVID-19 case growth rates. Additionally, some studies have suggested the idea of networked systems as witnesses of large-scale global events, such as Cardona et al. [12] and Bischof et al. [7].

### Conclusion

We argue that the ubiquity of networked systems in daily life provides a unique perspective on individual and collective actions. By studying the relationships between user mobility, content demand, and the spread of COVID-19, we demonstrated that changes in CDN demand are strongly correlated with social distancing behavior. Using CDN demand as a proxy for social distancing, we showed that increased social distancing is strongly correlated with decreasing infection growth rates. We also explored the combined benefits of social distancing and mask mandates, extending prior work on their effectiveness. Future research should focus on developing statistical models for prediction and addressing the limitations of current data sources.
