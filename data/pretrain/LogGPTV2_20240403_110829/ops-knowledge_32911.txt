User: I have a program in C that communicates via UDP with another program (in Java) and then does process manipulation (start/stop) based on the UDP pkt exchange.
Now this C program has been legacy and I want to convert it to Python - do you think Python will be a good choice for the tasks mentioned?
Assistant: If this is an embedded program, then it might be a problem to port it since Python programs typically rely on the Python runtime and library, and those are fairly large. Especially when compared to a C program doing a well-defined task. Of course, it's likely you've already considered that aspect, but I wanted to mention it in the context of the question anyway, since I feel it's an important aspect when doing this type of comparison.
