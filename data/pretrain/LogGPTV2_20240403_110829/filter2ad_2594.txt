ABSTRACT
The concept of policy-based cryptography is a promising
paradigm for trust establishment and authorization in large-
scale open environments like the Internet and Mobile Net-
works.
It aims at providing a framework for performing
cryptographic operations with respect to policies formalized
as monotone Boolean expressions written in standard nor-
mal forms. A policy involves conjunctions and disjunctions
of conditions where each condition is fulﬁlled by a digital
credential representing the signature of a speciﬁc credential
issuer on a set of statements about a certain entity. There-
fore, an entity fulﬁlls a policy if and only if it has been issued
a set of credentials fulﬁlling the combination of conditions
speciﬁed by the policy.
In this work, we focus on policy-based encryption schemes
which allow to encrypt a message according to a policy so
that only entities fulﬁlling the policy are able to decrypt the
message. More generally, policy-based encryption belongs to
an emerging family of encryption schemes sharing the abil-
ity to integrate encryption with access control structures.
This ability is mainly enabled by bilinear pairings over el-
liptic curves and allows for several interesting applications
in diﬀerent contexts.
A policy-based encryption scheme has to fulﬁll two pri-
mary requirements: on one hand, provable security under
well deﬁned attack models. On the other hand, eﬃciency,
especially when dealing with the conjunctions and disjunc-
tions of credential-based conditions.
The contributions of our research work are twofold:
1. The standard acceptable notion of security for public-
key encryption schemes is indistinguishability against cho-
sen ciphertext attacks. Hence, it is natural to require that
a policy-based encryption scheme also satisﬁes this strong
notion of security. However, the deﬁnition of this security
notion must be adapted to the policy-based setting. Our
ﬁrst contribution is the deﬁnition of policy-oriented security
model for policy-based encryption schemes as well as the
development of an eﬃcient policy-based encryption scheme
that is provably secure under our security model in the ran-
dom oracle model.
2. Policy-based encryption schemes may suﬀer from the
key-escrow property i.e. in addition to the legitimate holder
of the credentials fulﬁlling the encryption policy, any collu-
sion of credential issuers who are able to issue a set of cre-
dentials fulﬁlling the policy can decrypt the message. Our
second contribution is to address this issue through the no-
tion of policy-based public-key encryption. The latter al-
lows encrypting a message not only with respect to a policy
but also according to a public-key so that only an entity
fulﬁlling the policy and having access to the corresponding
private-key is able to decrypt the message. We developed
a policy-based public-key encryption scheme from bilinear
pairings and proved its security under the corresponding se-
curity model. Our proposal improves related work in terms
of both security and eﬃciency.
