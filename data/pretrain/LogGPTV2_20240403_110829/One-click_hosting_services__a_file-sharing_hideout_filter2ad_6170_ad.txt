Indeed, more than 50% of the Premium RapidShare
downloads got a throughput of more than 8Mbps - an order of mag-
nitude higher than BitTorrent downloads. Of course, RapidShare
Premium downloads are a paying service and many users would
prefer to not pay for ﬁle sharing, given that p2p services are also
free. The inner plot of Figure 14 suggests that the median down-
load session experiences higher throughput with the Free-cheating
RapidShare service than with BitTorrent. Indeed, 50% of the Free-
7In some cases, we could ﬁnd the exact same object uploaded in
both BitTorrent and RapidShare.
8It appears that Free-cheating is a popular behavior among OCH
users. Many content indexing sites offer instructions on how to
avoid the long waiting time that Free users have to experience. Of
course, it is possible to do so when the user can acquire different IP
addresses quickly and easily.

Server rs717dt has an even lower download load, but we do not
understand why.
In summary, it appears that RapidShare uses simple load bal-
ancing rules, allocating more upload requests to more recently de-
ployed servers, and assigning more download requests to servers
that do not also act as the indexing server of the group. On the
other hand, it seems that RapidShare does not try to control which
ISP will be used for each download request (if they were doing so,
the distribution in Figure 13 among the 10 download servers would
not be uniform).
6.7 Discussion and comparison with CDNs
In this section, we explored a typical OCH service architecture
Unfortunately, the service does not disclose such information and
so we cannot determine the accuracy or correctness of our conclu-
sions. Our results suggest that the architecture uses few thousands
of servers (and the number keeps increasing) that are multihomed
to several ISPs (some of them tier-1 transit providers). All servers
are in the same location, probably close to Frankfurt in Germany.
The servers are partitioned in groups of 12 servers each, while the
servers of the same group belong to different subnets (and are of-
ten connected to different ISPs). Each ﬁle is hosted by one server
group. It appears that upload requests are assigned to groups in a
manner that considers the “deployment age” of each group. The
actual upload server within the returned group, and the correspond-
ing ISP, can be selected by the user. In terms of download requests,
a user is directed to a speciﬁc download server from an indexing
server, which is a member of the group that hosts that ﬁle. The as-
signment of downloads appears to be uniform across the download
servers of the group.
The OCH architecture differs signiﬁcantly from traditional Web
Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), such as Akamai [1]. CDNs
maintain mirror servers in many geographic locations, as they at-
tempt to minimize the RTT between the user and the mirror server
that will serve that user. It is not uncommon for a large CDN to
be present at hundreds of geographical locations around the world.
This difference with OCH is reasonable: a traditional CDN aims to
minimize Web transaction delays and it is optimized for short TCP
ﬂows. An OCH service such as RapidShare, on the other hand, fo-
cuses on very large transfers that are less sensitive to delay. The
centralized architecture of OCH is probably less expensive, easier
to maintain, and it makes the migration of ﬁles between servers
faster and less costly. Another difference is that the main value that
CDNs offer to their customers is improved Web performance. For
OCH services, performance is less important compared to content
availability and the ability to share ﬁles inexpensively. Finally, the
business models of CDNs and OCH services are very different. The
former get their revenues from large content producers, while the
latter get their revenues from individuals that subscribe to Premium
accounts.

Our results suggest that RapidShare users enjoy a better ﬁle shar-
ing experience than BitTorrent users. Indeed, Premium RapidShare
users enjoy an order of magnitude higher download throughput
than BitTorrent users. Even free RapidShare users have the ben-
eﬁt of more available content on RapidShare than on BitTorrent.
Considering the actions a user has to follow to download an object,
we believe that the process is equally simple in both services. In
the case of BitTorrent, the user has to ﬁrst search for the torrent
ﬁle and then instrument her BitTorrent client to download that ob-
ject. Similarly, a RapidShare user needs to ﬁrst search for the object
and download it through her browser. When an object spans sev-
eral ﬁles, and thus several URLs need to be downloaded, there are
simple “download managers" for Web browsers that can reduce the
entire procedure to just a handful of mouse-clicks. Uploading ﬁles
is much easier in RapidShare because the user only uploads a ﬁle
in whole or in pieces. In BitTorrent one has to ﬁrst ﬁnd (or deploy)
a hosting tracker, create the torrent ﬁle, and maintain an always-on
host that will be serving the ﬁle until the swarm gets big enough.
Considering these differences, ﬁle sharing user communities may
have good reasons to use RapidShare instead of BitTorrent.
8. CONTENT INDEXING SITES
As previously mentioned, OCH services do not offer search or
indexing capabilities. To ﬁll this gap, a large number of content
indexing Web sites offer such capabilities to OCH users. These in-
dexing sites form several communities of users, ranging from gen-
eral interest to very speciﬁc interest content.
In this section we
explore some of these sites to better understand how users search
for objects in RapidShare, to examine the population of users that
post download URLs on indexing sites, and to characterize the pub-
licly visible RapidShare content in terms of type and copyright con-
straints.
8.1 Content uploaders
First, let us examine the community of RapidShare users that
post download links on OCH indexing sites. To do so, we crawled
four such sites shown in Table 4. The second column presents the
number of OCH URLs provided by each indexing site. For exam-
ple, rapidshareindex.org provides URLs to 54,327 objects
hosted by OCH services; 36,522 of those are hosted by RapidShare.
It is interesting that these 54,327 objects were uploaded by only 18
users! A very small number of uploaders is what we also observe
in other indexing sites.
Figure 15 shows the percentage of posts by each user of three
indexing sites. Again, we observe that a small number of users
post almost all download URLs. For instance, in rslinks.org,
only 5 users have posted more than 90% of the URLs, while in
rapidshareindex.com a single user has posted (almost) all
URLs.
As described in Section 2, ﬁles hosted by RapidShare become
stale/invalid when the uploader requests to remove them, or when
the uploader is a Free user and the ﬁle has either been downloaded
10 times or it has stayed inactive for a period of 90 days. Ta-
ble 4 also shows the number and percentage of stale objects. We
retrieved the state of each object by requesting it for download
from RapidShare, and then checking for a valid download response.
Stale ﬁles count for at most 19.3% of all ﬁles, and in one case for as
little as 0.5%. This is in sharp contrast with ﬁle availability in p2p
systems. For example, BitTorrent ﬁles have an average lifespan of
only 9 days [13].
An interesting possibility is that the percentage of stale ﬁles is
more community-speciﬁc, rather than service-speciﬁc. RapidShare

cheating RapidShare downloads receive more than 920kbps, while
the Free RapidShare and BitTorrent median download throughput
is about 600kbps. A small percentage of BitTorrent downloads
however, receive much higher rates than Free-cheating RapidShare
downloads. The fastest 10% of BitTorrent downloads receive more
than 2.4Mbps.
7.2 Content availability
We next focus on the issue of content availability in the two ser-
vices. To do so, we collected well-known lists of movies and songs,
such as the Internet Movie Database 9, and searched for them in
both RapidShare and BitTorrent. To verify that a speciﬁc object
exists on RapidShare we ﬁrst searched for it using Google, includ-
ing the term “rapidshare” as a keyword together with the title of
the object, and then examined the most relevant RapidShare link.
We rejected search results that would not contain the full name of
the object we search for. Then, we requested each collected URL
from RapidShare to examine if it is still available for download (but
without downloading the ﬁle).
To see whether a ﬁle exists on BitTorrent, we searched for it on
piratebay.org, the most popular torrent search site today that
hosts more than 600,000 torrents. The ﬁle was considered available
if there was at least one seeder for it. 10
Table 3 presents the related results. The second column shows
the number of ﬁles contained in the object list. The third column is
the number and percentage of objects that we were able to ﬁnd on
RapidShare using Google searches. The fourth column presents the
number and percentage of objects found on BitTorrent. We see that
in all cases, RapidShare has higher content availability than BitTor-
rent. For instance, in the “All Time USA Box Ofﬁce” hits, 98.5%
of the objects were found in RapidShare and 96.5% were found in
BitTorrent. The difference between RapidShare and BitTorrent be-
comes more important for the less popular content. In the “Bottom
100 movies” list, RapidShare hosts 90% of those movies, while
BitTorrent hosts only 50% of them. Users that are interested in this
type of content seam to prefer RapidShare instead of BitTorrent.
We speculate that users may prefer the simplicity of sharing ﬁles
through a web page with URLs to those ﬁles in contrast to using a
tracker and a speciﬁc ﬁle-sharing application.

could also have a large fraction of stale ﬁles, especially for ﬁles
uploaded by Free users. However, if a user community cares about
a ﬁle, they would not let it become stale by successively uploading
“fresh" versions. Based on the indexing sites we examined, we can
say that this seems to be the case for RapidShare user communities.
8.2 Characterization of publicly visible con-
tent
Currently, RapidShare allows Free users to download ﬁles up to
200 MB. Thus, most of the large objects that are publicly shared
are partitioned in ﬁles of that size (or smaller), and the user has to
download a number of URLs. For instance, a full DVD of 2.4GB
would be available through 12 URLs. In order to identify the type
of objects available in RapidShare we crawled the previous four in-
dexing sites and counted the number of download URLs per object.
Figure 16 shows the distribution of the number of URLs per ob-
ject for each indexing site. At most 60% of the objects consist of a
single URL. In the case of rslinks.org, this percentage drops
to as low as 3%. A closer look to that site reveals that it is mainly
used to share large video ﬁles (movies and TV series count for 80%
of its total objects) and application/game CDs ( 20%).
Figure 16: Percentage of download URLs per indexed object.
To get a more clear picture of the type of objects that are publicly
shared through OCH services, we manually examined the latest 100
objects seen at each of the previous four indexing sites. The results
are summarized in Table 5. We see that video ﬁles, applications and
audio collections are the largest categories - as expected. Again,
rslinks.org is only used for movies.
8.3 Copyrighted content
Internet ﬁle sharing, through p2p networks or through OCH ser-
vices, is constantly accused of copyright infringement. To get a
