**Download Throughput Comparison: RapidShare vs. BitTorrent**

Over 50% of Premium RapidShare downloads achieve a throughput exceeding 8 Mbps, which is significantly higher than the typical BitTorrent download speeds. While RapidShare's Premium service requires payment, many users opt for free file-sharing alternatives like BitTorrent. However, as shown in Figure 14, the median download session for the "Free-cheating" RapidShare service (where users bypass waiting times) still outperforms BitTorrent, with a median throughput of over 920 kbps compared to 600 kbps for both Free RapidShare and BitTorrent. Notably, the top 10% of BitTorrent downloads can exceed 2.4 Mbps.

**Load Balancing and Server Allocation**

RapidShare employs a straightforward load balancing strategy, directing more upload requests to recently deployed servers and more download requests to servers not functioning as indexing servers. This approach does not appear to control the ISP used for each download, as evidenced by the uniform distribution across the 10 download servers in Figure 13. The server rs717dt, for instance, has a lower download load, though the exact reason for this remains unclear.

**Comparison with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**

RapidShare's architecture differs markedly from traditional CDNs like Akamai. CDNs distribute content across numerous geographic locations to minimize round-trip time (RTT) and optimize for short TCP flows. In contrast, RapidShare focuses on large file transfers, which are less sensitive to latency. Its centralized architecture, likely located near Frankfurt, Germany, is cost-effective and easier to maintain, facilitating efficient file migration. Additionally, while CDNs aim to improve web performance for large content producers, RapidShare prioritizes content availability and cost-effective file sharing for individual users.

**User Experience and Content Availability**

Premium RapidShare users experience significantly higher download speeds compared to BitTorrent users. Even free RapidShare users benefit from a wider range of available content. The process of downloading files is similarly straightforward in both services, but uploading is simpler on RapidShare. For BitTorrent, users must find or deploy a tracker, create a torrent file, and maintain an always-on host, whereas RapidShare allows direct uploads.

Content availability on RapidShare surpasses that of BitTorrent, especially for less popular content. For example, 90% of the "Bottom 100 movies" list is available on RapidShare, compared to only 50% on BitTorrent. This suggests that users may prefer the simplicity of web-based file sharing over the more complex BitTorrent process.

**Content Indexing Sites**

RapidShare does not offer search or indexing capabilities, leading to the emergence of third-party indexing sites. These sites form communities of users, ranging from general interest to niche content. Our analysis of four such sites (Table 4) reveals that a small number of users post the majority of download links. For instance, on rslinks.org, just five users posted over 90% of the URLs. The percentage of stale (invalid) files is relatively low, ranging from 0.5% to 19.3%, contrasting sharply with the average 9-day lifespan of BitTorrent files.

**Characterization of Publicly Visible Content**

RapidShare limits free users to downloading files up to 200 MB, so larger objects are often split into multiple files. Figure 16 shows that up to 60% of indexed objects consist of a single URL, with some sites like rslinks.org primarily hosting large video files. Manual examination of the latest 100 objects on these sites (Table 5) indicates that video files, applications, and audio collections are the most common types of shared content.

**Copyrighted Content**

Internet file sharing, whether through P2P networks or OCH services, frequently faces accusations of copyright infringement. To better understand the nature of publicly shared content, we analyzed the copyright status of files on these indexing sites. Further details on this aspect will be provided in subsequent sections.
