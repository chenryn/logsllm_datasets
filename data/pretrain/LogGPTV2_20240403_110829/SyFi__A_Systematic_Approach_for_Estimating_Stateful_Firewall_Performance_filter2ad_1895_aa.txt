Abstract. Due to the lack of a standardized methodology for reporting
ﬁrewall performance, current datasheets are designed for marketing and
provide inﬂated throughput measurements obtained under unrealistic
scenarios. As a result, customers lack usable metrics to select a device
that best meets their needs.
In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to estimate the per-
formance oﬀered by stateful ﬁrewalls. To do so, we ﬁrst conduct extensive
experiments with two enterprise ﬁrewalls in a wide range of conﬁgura-
tions and traﬃc proﬁles to identify the characteristics of a network’s traf-
ﬁc that aﬀect ﬁrewall performance. Based on the observations from our
measurements, we develop a model that can estimate the expected per-
formance of a particular stateful ﬁrewall when deployed in a customer’s
network. Our model ties together a succinct set of network traﬃc char-
acteristics and ﬁrewall benchmarks. We validate our model with a third
enterprise-grade ﬁrewall, and ﬁnd that it predicts ﬁrewall throughput
with less than 6-10% error across a range of traﬃc proﬁles.

Introduction
Which ﬁrewall will meet the throughput requirement of our network?
Currently, a customer shopping for a ﬁrewall cannot ﬁnd a good answer to
this basic question. Since there is no systematic methodology for evaluating and
reporting ﬁrewall performance, ﬁrewall vendors report (a) unrealistically high
performance obtained with unspeciﬁed or arbitrarily chosen traﬃc proﬁles [1],
and (b) performance metrics that can be easily “gamed” [2] as we discuss later.
As a result, customers have to either rely on word-of-mouth recommendations
or go through the laborious process of testing each ﬁrewall themselves.
Thus far, characterizing ﬁrewall performance has received limited attention
from both industry and researchers. To counter approaches taken by ﬁrewall
vendors to report unrealistic high throughput numbers (e.g., by using maximum-
sized UDP packets), third-party testing agencies such as NSS [23] measure ﬁre-
wall performance using a more realistic pre-deﬁned traﬃc mix. Though a step
in the right direction, this approach is limited in that its results are not ap-
plicable for a customer with a diﬀerent traﬃc mix. Traﬃc characteristics vary
from site to site, and as we examine later, ﬁrewall throughput signiﬁcantly varies
across traﬃc proﬁles. On the other hand, the focus of the research community

has mainly been on improving ﬁrewall performance by optimizing the ﬁrewall
rule set [7,12,17], detecting ﬁrewall rule conﬂicts [18,9,8], and developing ﬁrewall
architectures that make ﬁrewalls eﬃcient and prevent such rule conﬂict errors
from occurring [16,15,19,20].
Our goal instead is to develop a meaningful way to characterize the perfor-
mance of stateful ﬁrewalls. Our approach is motivated by the observation that
the performance a customer can expect from a ﬁrewall depends on character-
istics of both network traﬃc at the customer’s site and the ﬁrewall’s hardware
and software. For example, Figure 1 shows the throughput obtained with three
enterprise-grade ﬁrewalls with three diﬀerent traﬃc proﬁles. We see that the
choice of the best ﬁrewall depends on the traﬃc proﬁle, and there is no ﬁrewall
that performs best in all cases.
In this paper, we ﬁrst experiment with two enterprise ﬁrewalls to determine
the characteristics of network traﬃc that impact their performance. We ﬁnd that
packet sizes and the number of active ﬁrewall sessions have minimal impact on
the ﬁrewall’s performance. On the other hand, our measurements show that the
protocol and packet type make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence; both ﬁrewalls incur much
higher processing overhead with 1) TCP packets as compared to UDP, and 2)
packets that create new sessions on the ﬁrewall compared to data packets that
belong to an existing session.
We use these observations to develop a simple model of stateful ﬁrewall per-
formance. Our model ties together two inputs—1) a proﬁle of the traﬃc at the
customer’s network, and 2) computational costs incurred by a ﬁrewall on diﬀer-
ent types of packets. We prescribe the format for the ﬁrst input based on our
observations of the resource requirements imposed on ﬁrewalls by diﬀerent types
of packets. We believe ﬁrewall vendors should be specifying the latter input in
their datasheets.
We validate our model with a third ﬁrewall, diﬀerent from the two used to
derive our model. We apply our model to a range of traﬃc proﬁles and ﬁnd that
in each case, our model’s estimate of the throughput is within 6% of measured
values. We also evaluate our model’s ability to predict the ﬁrewall’s performance
when subjected to a SYN ﬂood attack, and here too, its throughput estimates
are within a 10% error across traﬃc proﬁles.

2 Understanding Firewall Performance
In this section, we provide a brief background on stateful ﬁrewalls and then
describe our measurement-based approach to characterize them.
Background: A stateful ﬁrewall secures a private network by keeping track
of ﬂows and enforcing security policies. We use the term ﬂow (interchangeably
with session) in its commonly used sense—a stream of packets with the same
ﬁve tuple: source and destination IP address, source and destination port, and
protocol type. A stateful ﬁrewall inspects all incoming and outgoing packets
and decides to discard or accept a packet based on the sequence of rules in the
ﬁrewall rule set and its session table. A packet that belongs to a new session is
allowed to enter the network if permitted by the ﬁrewall rule set, whereas packets
corresponding to previously established sessions are let through by looking up
the session table.
Measurement-driven characterization. Here, we examine which factors af-
fect the performance of a stateful ﬁrewall in practice. We conduct focused exper-
iments for each factor in isolation on two commercial enterprise-level ﬁrewalls:
(a) SonicWall E5500 [6], and (b) Fortinet Fortigate-ONE [3]. Though both de-
vices come with additional security features such as intrusion detection, here we
focus on one of the common deployment scenarios for these devices where they
are conﬁgured to run as a stateful ﬁrewall. This reﬂects the current status quo
in which most customers rely on separate application-aware ﬁltering devices to
sit behind stateful ﬁrewalls [5], rather than bundling both features on the same
device. Note that the devices are not selected based on cost or hardware speciﬁ-
cation, and hence the purpose of this study is not to compare the ﬁrewalls, but
rather to ensure that our observations are not unique to any one ﬁrewall.
Traﬃc generator: We use the traﬃc generation tool from BreakingPoint Sys-
tems (BPS) [10] to generate synthetic traﬃc for our experiments. BPS is a power-
ful test tool used to measure and analyze the performance, security, and stability
of network devices. The BPS version that we use can generate up to 30 million
simultaneous sessions, 1.5 million sessions per second, and 16 Gbps of state-
ful blended application traﬃc with over 130 application protocols, suﬃcient to
stress-test all the ﬁrewalls we considered. It provided us enormous ﬂexibility to
simulate conditions needed to characterize the products.
Test setup: In our experiments, we used eight 1 Gbps interfaces on each ﬁrewall,
matched in pairs as input and output. Our aggregate maximum rate of 8 Gbps
suﬃced to reach the processing capacity of either ﬁrewall. Our test traﬃc gener-
ator serves as the source and destination for all generated ﬂows, and keeps track
of the number of transmitted and received packets and reports packet drops.
We adopt the industry-wide convention to calculate the performance as the sum
of the packets and bytes across all interfaces, irrespective of their direction (i.e.
from inside the network going outside or vice versa). Though a ﬁrewall’s perfor-
mance can be aﬀected by its rule set (ACL) size, given the operation on an ACL
(it only aﬀects the ﬁrst packet of every ﬂow) and the optimizations that one can
