## Abstract
Due to the lack of a standardized methodology for reporting firewall performance, current datasheets are often designed for marketing purposes and provide inflated throughput measurements obtained under unrealistic scenarios. Consequently, customers lack reliable metrics to select a device that best meets their needs.

In this paper, we present a systematic approach to estimate the performance offered by stateful firewalls. We conducted extensive experiments with two enterprise-grade firewalls across various configurations and traffic profiles to identify the key characteristics of network traffic that affect firewall performance. Based on our observations, we developed a model that can predict the expected performance of a specific stateful firewall when deployed in a customer's network. Our model integrates a concise set of network traffic characteristics and firewall benchmarks. We validated our model using a third enterprise-grade firewall and found that it predicts firewall throughput with an error margin of less than 6-10% across different traffic profiles.

## 1. Introduction
Which firewall will meet the throughput requirement of our network? Currently, a customer shopping for a firewall cannot find a satisfactory answer to this fundamental question. The absence of a systematic methodology for evaluating and reporting firewall performance leads to vendors providing (a) unrealistically high performance figures based on unspecified or arbitrarily chosen traffic profiles [1], and (b) performance metrics that can be easily manipulated [2]. As a result, customers must either rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or go through the laborious process of testing each firewall themselves.

To date, characterizing firewall performance has received limited attention from both industry and researchers. To counter the practices of firewall vendors who report unrealistically high throughput numbers (e.g., by using maximum-sized UDP packets), third-party testing agencies such as NSS [23] measure firewall performance using a more realistic predefined traffic mix. While this is a step in the right direction, it is limited because the results may not be applicable to a customer with a different traffic mix. Traffic characteristics vary from site to site, and as we will show, firewall throughput varies significantly across different traffic profiles.

The research community has primarily focused on improving firewall performance by optimizing the firewall rule set [7, 12, 17], detecting firewall rule conflicts [18, 9, 8], and developing firewall architectures that enhance efficiency and prevent rule conflict errors [16, 15, 19, 20].

Our goal is to develop a meaningful way to characterize the performance of stateful firewalls. We observed that the performance a customer can expect from a firewall depends on both the characteristics of the network traffic at the customer’s site and the firewall’s hardware and software. For example, Figure 1 shows the throughput obtained with three enterprise-grade firewalls under three different traffic profiles. It is evident that the choice of the best firewall depends on the traffic profile, and no single firewall performs best in all cases.

In this paper, we first experiment with two enterprise-grade firewalls to determine the characteristics of network traffic that impact their performance. We find that packet sizes and the number of active firewall sessions have minimal impact on performance. However, our measurements show that the protocol and packet type significantly affect performance; both firewalls incur much higher processing overhead with 1) TCP packets compared to UDP, and 2) packets that create new sessions on the firewall compared to data packets that belong to an existing session.

We use these observations to develop a simple model of stateful firewall performance. Our model integrates two inputs: 1) a profile of the traffic at the customer’s network, and 2) computational costs incurred by the firewall on different types of packets. We prescribe the format for the first input based on our observations of the resource requirements imposed on firewalls by different types of packets. We believe firewall vendors should specify the latter input in their datasheets.

We validate our model using a third firewall, different from the two used to derive the model. We apply our model to a range of traffic profiles and find that in each case, our model’s estimate of the throughput is within 6% of the measured values. We also evaluate our model’s ability to predict the firewall’s performance under a SYN flood attack, and here too, its throughput estimates are within a 10% error margin across traffic profiles.

## 2. Understanding Firewall Performance
In this section, we provide a brief background on stateful firewalls and then describe our measurement-based approach to characterize them.

### Background
A stateful firewall secures a private network by keeping track of flows and enforcing security policies. We use the term "flow" (interchangeably with "session") in its commonly used sense—a stream of packets with the same five-tuple: source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and protocol type. A stateful firewall inspects all incoming and outgoing packets and decides whether to discard or accept a packet based on the sequence of rules in the firewall rule set and its session table. A packet that belongs to a new session is allowed to enter the network if permitted by the firewall rule set, whereas packets corresponding to previously established sessions are let through by looking up the session table.

### Measurement-Driven Characterization
Here, we examine which factors affect the performance of a stateful firewall in practice. We conduct focused experiments for each factor in isolation on two commercial enterprise-level firewalls: (a) SonicWall E5500 [6] and (b) Fortinet Fortigate-ONE [3]. Although both devices come with additional security features such as intrusion detection, we focus on a common deployment scenario where they are configured to run as stateful firewalls. This reflects the current status quo in which most customers rely on separate application-aware filtering devices to sit behind stateful firewalls [5], rather than bundling both features on the same device. Note that the devices were not selected based on cost or hardware specifications, and the purpose of this study is not to compare the firewalls but to ensure that our observations are not unique to any one firewall.

#### Traffic Generator
We use the traffic generation tool from BreakingPoint Systems (BPS) [10] to generate synthetic traffic for our experiments. BPS is a powerful test tool used to measure and analyze the performance, security, and stability of network devices. The BPS version we use can generate up to 30 million simultaneous sessions, 1.5 million sessions per second, and 16 Gbps of stateful blended application traffic with over 130 application protocols, sufficient to stress-test all the firewalls we considered. It provided us with the flexibility to simulate conditions needed to characterize the products.

#### Test Setup
In our experiments, we used eight 1 Gbps interfaces on each firewall, matched in pairs as input and output. Our aggregate maximum rate of 8 Gbps was sufficient to reach the processing capacity of either firewall. Our test traffic generator served as the source and destination for all generated flows and kept track of the number of transmitted and received packets, reporting any packet drops. We adopted the industry-wide convention to calculate performance as the sum of the packets and bytes across all interfaces, irrespective of their direction (i.e., from inside the network going outside or vice versa). Although a firewall’s performance can be affected by its rule set (ACL) size, given the operation on an ACL (it only affects the first packet of every flow) and the optimizations that can be applied, we did not consider this a significant factor in our experiments.

### Experimental Results
Figure 1 shows the variation in maximum throughput across different firewalls and traffic profiles. It is clear that the choice of the best firewall depends on the traffic profile, and no single firewall performs best in all cases.

Figure 2 illustrates the effect of the number of active concurrent sessions on the maximum packet rate. Our findings indicate that packet sizes and the number of active firewall sessions have minimal impact on performance. However, the protocol and packet type significantly affect performance; both firewalls incur much higher processing overhead with 1) TCP packets compared to UDP, and 2) packets that create new sessions on the firewall compared to data packets that belong to an existing session.

These observations form the basis of our model, which we will discuss in detail in the following sections.
