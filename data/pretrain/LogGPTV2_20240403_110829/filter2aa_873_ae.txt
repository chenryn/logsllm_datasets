the networks and start from scratch again, or b) change the competence of corporate/govt 
infosec folks to not tolerate mediocrity and empower them with the authority, resources, 
and support to do what it takes to "do it right."  Otherwise we're just throwing good 
money after bad and perpetuating the status quo.  It's why I no longer do pen tests or red 
teams, because folks don't really learn from our findings, they just want to check-the-box 
each year. So for me, why bother?  I'm not making a tangible difference anymore, so if 
clients don't care, apart from maybe making a nice profit on a gig to offer 
recommendations that I know will be ignored, why should I? 
There are some pretty good papers discussing the economic incentives of keeping the 
state of infosec just as-is, because it's beneficial to vendors / consultants.   You know, like 
how the pharmaceutical industry likes it when folks stay sick so they can sell more drugs. 
Nobody wants a "cure" -- the "vendors" don't, and the "patients" just chalk incidents up 
as the price of doing business in cyberspace and look for a palliative, rather than a 
curative. 
Another said: the problem is that to tell the truth, one has to 1) not be a vendor and 
2) be willing to spill the beans on getting owned. There are very few people that are 
willing to get up and say "I work security, my job is to prevent intrusions, we get 
owned a lot (so I kind of fail at my job), sometimes it is really bad, and here is how 
we deal with it." 
Telling someone how you have to reverse engineer 0day attacks and unravel complex 
malware *as fast as possible* can be very sexy, and using real world examples to back it 
up really helps bring the message home. 
In airing the dirty laundry you reveal defensive techniques you have adapted that in many 
cases actually work at stopping the bad guys (or at least some of them for a while). But 
by speaking about these techniques publicly you are telling your enemies how to adapt, 
so you have yet another sexy aspect of defense you can discuss. 
Another: even when we do our jobs correctly, we're all still going to get owned.  The 
real challenge is getting business leaders to accept that reality and allow us to 
redirect funding to programs that help companies deal with that reality. 
30 
And another:  Attacks can be simple, silver bullet, and developed by one guy. This makes 
them easy to describe. Defenses are mulitlayered and have timelines of years and take 
teams of people to implement. defense is boring because we already know what to do. It 
is not a technology problem but a business problem. That is why one of my focuses is to 
make application security as cheap and consumable by the masses as possible. 
And another:  After working mostly in red teaming and pen-testing, I took a job 
running security for a hedge fund for a few years.  Working defense is distinctly more 
challenging than offense for unexpected reasons, and this is how I saw it as being 
different: 
1. You are held back by people and processes, not technical challenges 
2. Success is the result of thoroughness, not cleverness 
3. Success is gradual and continual, not sporadic and elusive 
On offense (pen-testing or research), you find yourself thinking, "If only I could figure 
out how to do X".  On defense, I found myself thinking mostly, "If only I could get so-
and-so/everyone to do X". The solutions and improvements were largely nothing 
magical, but more like eating your vegetables.  You know that you should do it, you just 
have to do it consistently and thoroughly over many years to obtain the benefits.  And 
let's face it, eating your vegetables isn't exactly new or "sexy", but the results of doing so 
over many years may be. 
WHISTLEBLOWERS AND TEAM PLAYERS –  revisited 
It was only after whistleblowers came out of the closet during the Great Economic 
Deflation that Time Magazine honored the practice of what team players call “ratting out 
your pals.” Conservative magazines like Time may give lip service to whistle blowing in 
the abstract but never champion whistle blowers until after they have sung. Instead they 
support the conditions and practices which make whistleblowers a threat in the first place.  
Whistleblowers are a reminder that ethics must be embodied in real flesh-and-blood 
human beings who put themselves on the line. Unless our deeper beliefs and values 
become flesh, they are words words words designed to make us feel better, rationalize 
misdeeds, and send distracting pangs of conscience straight into space.  
If you have never known a real flesh-and-blood whistleblower, see the film “The Insider” 
for a good portrait. The film confirms the conclusion of a Washington law firm 
specializing in whistleblower cases that lists motivations for whistle blowing – money, 
anger and resentment, revenge, justice – and eliminates all but one as sufficient to carry a 
whistleblower through the abuse they will face. Only acting from a pained conscience 
will sustain a whistleblower through the ordeal.   
During a recent speech for accountants about ethics, our Q&A moved quickly into the 
gray areas where accountants spend much of their time. Outsiders think accountants live 
in a black and white grid with simple answers but in fact they wade through a swamp of 
maybe this or maybe that.  
31 
Accountants are paid whistleblowers. Accountants are intended to be in the corporate 
culture but not of it, to use company books like mirrors to reveal the truth and 
consequences of choices. That’s why it is so difficult to do the job right.  
The tension comes from the fact that only an individual can have a conscience. An 
institution or organization can develop a culture that supports doing the right thing only 
when a leader pursues that objective with single-minded intensity. Left to themselves, all 
cultures are based on survival, not telling the truth. Cultures reward team players, not 
whistleblowers. In all my years as a teacher, priest, speaker and consultant, I have never 
seen a culture with a conscience.  
A cop friend reminds me that the first time a rookie cop sees his partners beat someone 
up in an alley or notices that money or cocaine doesn’t always get back to the station, he 
is closely watched. The word goes out quickly that "he's OK" or "watch out for him." 
Those that are OK move up. The cop is a practicing Roman Catholic and noted that 
recent scandals in the church are symptoms of the same dynamics.  
Institutions usually encourage disclosure only when it no longer matters. Operation 
Northwoods – the desire by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 to eliminate Fidel Castro by 
sinking refugee boats from Cuba, attacking our own base at Guantanamo, and planting 
terror bombs in American cities – was revealed by James Bamford in his book “Body of 
Secrets,” but nary a peep of outrage greeted revelation of the treasonous scheme. When 
the Church apologized to Galileo for torturing him four hundred years after the fact, it 
raised the question of how an institution had so lost its moorings that someone might 
think an absurd gesture like that had meaning.  
Why are so many of your heroes, I was asked, people who were assassinated? Why do 
names like Jesus, Lincoln, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. keep showing up in your 
conversation? 
I think it’s because they embody what it takes to make a stand on behalf of the truth. 
They were all human but found the courage to blow the whistle on the cultures of death 
our institutions create. Their reward was getting whacked.  
Make no mistake, those who articulate or embody an upward call always inspire 
ambivalence. A disciple of Gandhi said that even those who loved him most were 
secretly relieved when he was murdered because for the moment the pressure was off. 
Jesus as icon is malleable in the hands of his institutional custodians whereas Jesus the 
Jew in the street was a real pain.  
In an era characterized by increasing secrecy by the government and the gradual but 
progressive surrender of our rights, it’s only a matter of time until some malevolent 
design ripens and bursts into the sunlight because some whistleblower just can’t stand it 
another minute. Some team player, their motives mixed but their conscience pricked,

will tell the truth. That’s the only way to have accountability when those with power and 
privilege remove transparency from the processes of government and business.  
When a mainstream Midwest woman asks how she will tell her grandchildren what 
America was like before the Great Change, how she will explain openness and 
disclosure, the Freedom of Information Act, guarantees in the Bill of Rights … then I 
know that we don’t need a weatherman to know the direction of the wind and see the 
firestorm on the horizon. Signs of the times grow on trees like low-hanging fruit, ripe for 
the picking.  
We are all team players, all of us some of the time, some of us all of the time, but we 
each have our own particular crossroads where we must decide if our words will become 
flesh. It is never easy and there are always consequences. Only integrity will see us 
through to the bitter end and none of us really know if we have it until it is tested. 
Again, what is the real state of the craft? 
“A lot of people - and particularly non-technical leaders - aren't willing to ask the 
next round of hard questions because they haven't come to the realization that 
what we've currently got is fundamentally broken. There are folks out there still 
trying to perfect AV and IDS mouse traps.  I suggest that no "big data" solution is 
going to magically solve the problem of the "I have to see it first in order to detect 
it later" brokenness that represents the foundation of the vast majority of our 
controls.  
Why raise this as an important step?  Because I wonder if one can initiate honest 
dialog about fundamental change without acknowledging the need for that dialog.  
(i.e. This shit doesn't work, now lets start the hard conversation about real change)  
Risk and accountability.  our inability to accurately identify and convey 
technology risks kills us.  What is the cost of Adobe Reader vulns when they are 
used to steal your CAD diagrams that result in knock-off parts being 
manufactured in China?  That's an extreme example, but this conversation needs 
to 
occur 
AT 
EXECUTIVE 
LEVELS.  
if we don't start the dialog with honest assessments and realistic assumptions we 
have zero hope of moving forward.  And I think that starts with "give up on x 
technologies - they are at the end of their lives." 
a lot of the "shocking" public  realizations that have transpired the last 12-24 
months (Zeus, wikileaks, stuxnet, the HBG fiasco) are the formalized and 
weaponized materializations of what we knew was possible all along.

 and another: 
I guess it basically comes down to handling risk. You assume the worse risk scenarios 
possible, and proceed to develop trust models that usually don't fully mitigate all risks. 
You simply are mitigating your fear. It isn't "how much security do I need until I have no 
risk" it is "how much security do I need until I can live comfortably with the various risks 
I feel I am facing".  
REPRISE: ENDING WHERE WE BEGAN 
 “The price one pays for pursuing any profession or calling is an intimate knowledge 
of its ugly side.” – James Baldwin 
"Whoever battles monsters should take care not to become a monster too, 
For if you stare long enough into the Abyss, the Abyss stares also into you." 
- Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, chapter 4, no. 146 
THE BIGGEST LESSON: 
THINGS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM 
 e.g.  making jihadist web sites more robust.  
In Mind Games, read at least the introduction to “Zero Day Roswell.” 
security is more than implementation of software & hardware. it’s creation of a 
geopolitical structure than enables us to believe tomorrow will be like today. It is the 
amelioration of the anxieties of life, often using fictitious narratives as a way to say 
“there there” as we tuck in society for the night with a kiss.  
e.g. we recontextualize anomalies as known events, so they won’t be feared: 
a terror attack degrades the mind of society. an accident does not. 
assassins – always said to be an anomalous lone gunman. As Dulles, former CIA 
Director, told the Warren Commission, when asked about the plot to kill Lincoln and a 
simultaneous plot to kill Andrew Johnson – “that proves my point.” 
34 
In short, we live in a bat-shit crazy-making world. 
How can we use the word “security” as if we mean ... security? what is it, then? as wise 
guys say, it is what it is.  
try to find out what’s going on? That’s a full time job, and most people are 
distracted by work, family, amusements.  
Jonathan Moreno – author of Mind Wars. How hard it was to explore that subject, despite 
credentials. 
Steve Miles – torture including physicians which means experimentation. George Bush 
saying we used water boarding 3 times. Complete bullshit. Oops death and the Uzbeks. 
Oh yeah? You ever work with the Turks? 
Water boarding is a distraction. It’s nothing compared to what we do. 
What does it do to us? secondary trauma: going over the line:  
Multiple sources of accountability when a videotape shows interrogator as well as the 
interrogated That’s a metaphor for complexifying the situation with too much 
information, confusing information, multiplying sources of information, disinformation, 
and misinformation. 
It is not just the “stupid user” problem – it is the human condition. Sometimes tech 
people speak to security issues as if they are not subject to the human condition. But 
specialized knowledge can be a trap if it is not contextualized in a wider understanding.  
The cutting edge is no longer just information technology but cross-disciplinary 
knowledge, biology (markers: 2004 new president at MIT from biology, Gates saying he 
would be in biology today, DIYbio, biohacking) 
what can we do? Victor Frankl as an example.  
WE, not they. Understand our real role in the body politic. Work to moderate the worst 
threats to stability and ensure robust societies and economies in which we can be more 
fully human.  
Remember what the undercover cop in the film said: I don’t know if I am a cop 
pretending to be a criminal or a criminal pretending to be a cop. Until we look into the 
mirror and see that, we are in danger of believing in our beliefs. We need to take 
ourselves seriously but not too seriously, just seriously enough: be mindful and vigilant.  
And all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.
