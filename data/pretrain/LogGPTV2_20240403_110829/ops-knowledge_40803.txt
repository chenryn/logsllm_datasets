User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What consequences to take from what i read in logfiles? Since some weeks i manage my first Webserver, a Seaside application behind an Apache proxy on Linode, and i installed logwatch to send me daily logs.

Where can i get information on when i have to act as a consequence of what i read in these logwatch reports?

For example i read that all kinds of people try to login on funny nonexisting accounts or all kinds of webcrawlers test for nonexisting cms login pages, some ip adresses get banned and unbanned by fail2ban...

I assume that's normal? Is it? But how do i know that i probably have to do something? What do i look for in the logs?

Yep that's called internet background noise, hackers trying to get into your machine. It's pretty normal. Anyway what you can do is install a host based intrusion detection system like OSSEC. The benefit is that you this will block attacks so you can sleep better at night.
