Abstract—In this paper we extend the class of MAP queueing
networks to include blocking models, which are useful to describe
the performance of service instances which have a limited con-
currency level. We consider two different blocking mechanisms:
Repetitive Service-Random Destination (RS-RD) and Blocking
After Service (BAS). We propose a methodology to evaluate MAP
queueing networks with blocking based on the recently proposed
Quadratic Reduction (QR), a state space transformation that
decreases the number of states in the Markov chain underlying
the queueing network model. From this reduced state space,
we obtain boundable approximations on average performance
indexes such as throughput, response time, utilizations. The two
approximations that dramatically enhance the QR bounds are
based on maximum entropy and on a novel minimum mutual
information principle, respectively. Stress cases of increasing
complexity illustrate the excellent accuracy of the proposed
approximations on several models of practical interest.
I. INTRODUCTION
Blocking is the phenomenon where an IT service may not
be available for a period of time, therefore any request for this
service has to wait until the service becomes available again.
This service unavailability can stem from a physical limit
(e.g., memory or concurrency constraints) or it can relate to a
system management decision in order to overcome an overload
period and to guarantee QoS requirements. Consequently,
blocking can affect system performance signiﬁcantly. Despite
its importance, blocking is a difﬁcult phenomenon to model
analytically, because it creates strong inter-dependencies in
the system’s components. The blocking concept can be sum-
marized as follows: when a queue reaches its maximum
capacity, then the ﬂow of customers entering the queue is
stopped. Queueing networks with blocking have been used to
model telecommunication and computer systems with limited
shared resources, such as interconnecting links or store-and-
forward buffers, as well as production systems with ﬁnite
storage buffers. We point the interested reader to [3], [16],
[17], [18] for an extensive bibliography of different blocking
mechanisms that model distinct behaviors of real systems
including computer systems [9], communication systems and
networks [1], [7], and software architectures [2].
Despite the practical applications of blocking queueing
models,
there is a lack of robust methodologies for their
solution, which stems from the fact that general blocking
queueing networks are not separable. The problem is worsened
if the service processes of the various stations are non-renewal,
a case of increasing importance to represent real systems
such as multi-tier applications [13], [19]. Given the fact that
blocking creates performance dependencies that are hard to
understand without a sound methodology, there is a clear need
for robust and general solutions.
In this paper, we provide a robust approximation method-
ology for various performance measures for MAP queueing
networks with blocking, which relies on numerical optimiza-
tion techniques and that enjoys errors bounds. In particular,
we focus on the case of networks with a closed population of
jobs that are the most important for sizing computer systems
that have upper limits on the maximum number of concurrent
users, and generalize the class of MAP queueing networks
proposed in [5] to include blocking mechanisms. MAP queue-
ing networks admit service processes that are described by
Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs), a class of Markov-
modulated point processes that can model general distributions
as well as the main features of non-renewal workloads, such
as autocorrelation in service times or burstiness. Naturally,
MAP queueing networks do not admit product form solutions
and can be viewed as a generalization of non-product form
networks with renewal service processes. In [5] the quadratic
reduction (QR) bounding methodology for the solution of
MAP queueing networks has been proposed. Applying the
QR bounds to MAP blocking networks is a challenging
problem because in presence of blocking the state space often
differs signiﬁcantly with respect to the original MAP queueing
network state space, thus the QR characterizations obtained
in [5] is not directly applicable anymore. The contributions of
this paper can be summarized as follows:
∙ we provide a major extension to the Quadratic Reduc-
tion (QR) technique ﬁrst introduced in [5] by including
blocking.
∙ we introduce approximations based on maximum en-
tropy [11] and a novel minimum mutual
information
principle that are shown to accurately predict model per-
formance with only small error that dramatically improve
the quality of the extension of the QR technique for MAP
blocking networks.
Throughout this paper we consider a closed queueing net-
work with routing matrix 𝑃 such that jobs departing from
queue 𝑖 are directed to queue 𝑗 with probability 𝑝𝑖𝑗. If the
capacity of queue 𝑗 is 𝐹𝑗 and 𝑛𝑗 denotes the current population
at queue 𝑗, then when 𝑛𝑗 = 𝐹𝑗 queue 𝑗 does not accept in its

consider the Blocking After Service (BAS) and the Repetitive
Service-Random Destination (RS-RD) mechanisms [3].
∙ Blocking After Service (BAS)
A queue 𝑖, if not empty,
processes a job regardless of the job population at its
destination 𝑗. When node 𝑖 completes service and node 𝑗
is full, node 𝑖 suspends any activity (i.e., it is blocked) and
the completed job waits until a departure occurs from node
𝑗. At that moment two simultaneous transitions take place:
the completed/blocked job moves from 𝑖 to 𝑗 (since 𝑗 can
now accept a job, 𝑖 “unblocks”) and the job that leaves
𝑗 (which effectively “unblocks” server 𝑖). In a general
network topology where more than one queue compete for
sending a job towards a full queue 𝑗, a policy regulating
the order in which queues unblock has to be deﬁned.
Usually, the First Blocked First Unblocked (FBFU) policy
is considered fair: ﬁrst unblock the queue that was blocked
ﬁrst. In the remaining of this paper when we consider
BAS we assume that it uses the FBFU policy. BAS models
production systems and disk I/O subsystems [20].
∙ Repetitive Service-Random Destination (RS-RD)
A
queue 𝑖, if not empty, processes a job regardless of the
job population at its destination 𝑗. If node 𝑗 is full, the
completed job is rerouted to node 𝑖 where it receives a
new service. During the new service, the job may select
a destination that is independent from its previous one.
Note that according to RS-RD blocking a node is never
actually blocked, but it “wastes” its service by repeating
it. RS-RD blocking is used to model congestion control in
telecommunications systems [1].
The above two blocking mechanisms introduce complexity
in the underlying Markov chains of MAP queueing networks.
On one hand, RS-RD restricts the original state space, while
preserving its regular structure, on the other hand BAS intro-
duces new states describing the order in which queues progres-
sively block once the capacity of the destination node becomes
full, this information is needed to implement the FBFU rule.
At a higher level, ﬂows in a MAP network with blocking
are harder to understand than in a MAP network without
blocking because of the additional routing complication that
is introduced.
Here, we incorporate additional
information in the QR
marginal probabilities and obtain a new class of specialized
conditions that allows to represent the simultaneous unblock-
ing and departure events that happen upon completion from
a node that is full. Such conditions can accomodate Markov-
modulated service rates, thus integrating within blocking mod-
els complex features such as higher-order moments and tem-
poral dependence yet are not sufﬁcient to result in tight bounds
for blocking systems. The two approximation techniques that
we introduce for blocking networks here, i.e., the maximum
entropy method (MEM) and the minimal mutual information
(MIM), can be used to “correct” the QR bounds by driving
the estimation of the equilibrium probabilities of the model
using nonlinear optimization. This correction shows to be very

effective to address simultaneously (and very effectively) two
difﬁcult problems: the complex features of blocking networks
and the complexities introduced by temporal dependence.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II
we deﬁne MAP queueing networks with BAS blocking and
develop their analytical characterization by means of the QR
state space reduction. Section III extends the analysis to RS-
RD blocking. Section IV discusses the performance approx-
imations and bounds following from the characterization of
the QR marginal probabilities and illustrate them on a set of
models with BAS and RS-RD blocking. Section V presents
a set of experiments that illustrate the proximity of the two
approximations to exact solutions. Finally, Section VI gives
conclusions and outlines future work.
II. MAP QUEUEING NETWORKS WITH BAS BLOCKING
We introduce the class of MAP queueing networks support-
ing temporal dependent service. We ﬁrst present the case of the
BAS blocking mechanism. The RS-RD blocking mechanism
is simpler and it is discussed in Section III.
We consider a closed MAP queueing network with 𝑁 jobs
visiting 𝑀 single-server queues having ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-serve
scheduling. For each queue 𝑖, its service time process is a
load-independent Markovian Arrival Process [6]. To reduce
the complexity of the notation, we present for the BAS case
only where a single queue 𝑓 has ﬁnite capacity 𝐹𝑓  0). In this
state space, the Markov process transitions have rates from
state s = (s1, s2, . . . , s𝑀 ) to s′ = (s′
𝑀 ) that are
uniquely deﬁned by the rates 𝑞𝑘,ℎ
𝑖,𝑗 of jobs ﬂowing from 𝑖 to 𝑗
in phase 𝑘 leaving 𝑖 in phase ℎ.

The size of the inﬁnitesimal generator corresponds to the
cardinality of the related global balance equations. By con-
sidering only the population components 𝑛𝑖, the state space
of a blocking network is a subset of the state space of the
same network but with inﬁnite capacity queues. This is logical
because all states with 𝑛𝑓 > 𝐹𝑓 do not exist. On the other
hand, the order in which queues block needs to be accounted
for explicitly in 𝒎, which increases the state space cardinality.
Thus, the state space of a BAS queueing network can be
smaller or bigger than in the non-blocking case depending
on the number of queues and jobs being considered.
