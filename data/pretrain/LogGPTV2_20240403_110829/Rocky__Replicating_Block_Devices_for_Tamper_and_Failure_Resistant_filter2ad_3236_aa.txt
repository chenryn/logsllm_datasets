## Abstract
Edge-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (EdgeVDI) brings the power of virtualized desktops to cloudlets closer to users, making it an attractive solution for wide-area network (WAN) mobility. However, ransomware and wiper malware pose significant cybersecurity threats to EdgeVDI. Existing tamper-resistant solutions do not address cloudlet failures. In this paper, we introduce Rocky, the first distributed replicated block device for EdgeVDI that can recover from both tampering attacks and failures. The key innovation is replicating a consistent write sequence across cloudlets as an append-only, immutable mutation history. Additionally, Rocky uses a replication broker to manage heterogeneous cloudlets, allowing them to control replication rates and reduce disk space and network bandwidth consumption by coalescing writes. We implemented Rocky in Java, and our experimental results show that its write and read throughputs are comparable to a baseline device, with 8.4% and 11.9% additional overheads, respectively. Furthermore, Rocky reduced repeated writes by 88.5% and 100% for editing presentation slides and photos, respectively.

## 1 Introduction
Accessing the same desktop environment from any device and location has long been a goal of personal computing. Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) was proposed as a solution, allowing users to connect to a remote VM via RDP. Commercial VDI solutions like VMware Horizon, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop have gained popularity. However, these solutions are limited for users who need to access VDI over WAN due to high latency.

Emerging technologies such as 5G and edge computing offer a solution. Cloudlets, which are server-class computers between user devices and the cloud, can significantly reduce network latency. EdgeVDI leverages cloudlets to provide VDI services for users requiring legacy applications and WAN mobility. However, EdgeVDI is vulnerable to ransomware and wiper malware, which can compromise the desktop environment. Recent incidents, such as the Colonial Pipeline attack, highlight the severity of these threats.

Several researchers have developed tamper-resistant storage systems, but these often require hardware modifications or special devices. Existing solutions also fail to address cloudlet failures, which can lead to data loss. In this paper, we present Rocky, a distributed replicated block device for tamper and failure-resistant EdgeVDI. Rocky provides security and reliability guarantees without requiring special hardware. It can restore the block device to a pre-tampered state and recover from cloudlet failures. The key enabler is the careful management of block device replication on distributed cloudlets.

## 2 Problem Statement

### 2.1 Target Environment
Figure 1 illustrates the target environment for Rocky. Each Rocky block device is installed on a cloudlet and used as a passthrough device by a VM. The Rocky block device processes VM's block I/O and replicates writes to other cloudlets via a connector-cloudlet. A set of Rocky block devices forms an ensemble, providing a coherent block device for the VM. Only one active Rocky block device handles VM's block I/O requests at any given time. As the VM migrates following the user, the active Rocky block device changes accordingly.

**Threat Model**: We assume a powerful adversary capable of compromising a victim's thin client device or the VM on a cloudlet.
