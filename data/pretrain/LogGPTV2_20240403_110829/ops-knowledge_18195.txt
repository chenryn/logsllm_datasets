To identify patterns in the log, I have abstracted the key elements and replaced specific values with placeholders. This will help in recognizing the structure and recurring elements. Here is the optimized pattern:

```
<DATE> <TIME> GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent[<PID>/<THREAD>] [lvl=<LEVEL>] -[KSOutOfProcessFetcher(PrivateMethods) launchedHelperTaskForToolPath:error:] KSOutOfProcessFetcher launched '/Users/xpc/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/MacOS/ksfetch' with process id: <CHILD_PID>
```

### Explanation:
- **<DATE>**: Placeholder for the date (e.g., 2017-07-02).
- **<TIME>**: Placeholder for the time (e.g., 15:46:40.516).
- **<PID>**: Placeholder for the process ID of `GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent` (e.g., 32432).
- **<THREAD>**: Placeholder for the thread identifier (e.g., 0x7000002a0000).
- **<LEVEL>**: Placeholder for the log level (e.g., 2).
- **<CHILD_PID>**: Placeholder for the process ID of the launched child process (e.g., 32433).

This pattern highlights the consistent structure of the log entries, making it easier to identify and extract relevant information.
