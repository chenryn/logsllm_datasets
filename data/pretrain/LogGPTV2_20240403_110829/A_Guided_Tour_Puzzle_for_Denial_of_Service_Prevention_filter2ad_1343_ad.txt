#### Client Puzzles and Their Variants
Client puzzles, introduced by Juels and Brainard [2], are hash-based schemes designed to defend against connection depletion attacks. These puzzles address the issue of pre-computation, which is a common form of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Aura et al. [4] extended client puzzles to protect authentication protocols from DoS attacks, while Dean and Stubblefield [5] implemented a DoS-resistant TLS protocol using client puzzle extensions.

Wang and Reiter [6] further developed client puzzles to prevent TCP SYN flooding by introducing the concept of puzzle auctions. Price [22] identified a weakness in client puzzles and their extensions, proposing a fix that includes client contributions during puzzle generation. Waters et al. [23] suggested outsourcing puzzle distribution to an external service called a bastion to secure the distribution process from DoS attacks. However, this centralization can create a single point of failure, and the scheme remains vulnerable to the attack described by Price [22].

Wang and Reiter [24] used a hash-based puzzle scheme to mitigate bandwidth-exhaustion attacks at the network layer. Feng et al. [25] argued that placing puzzle schemes at the network (IP) layer could provide broader protection for various applications and protocols. They implemented a hint-based hash reversal puzzle at the IP layer to counteract application or transport layer defenses [3].

Parno et al. [8] developed Portcullis, which uses a puzzle scheme similar to Wang's puzzle auction to prevent denial-of-capability attacks. This scheme moves puzzle generation to clients, reducing server overhead. However, it gives higher priority to clients willing to solve more complex puzzles, potentially favoring powerful attackers.

#### Non-Parallelizable Puzzles
Non-parallelizable puzzles are designed to thwart DDoS attackers who use parallel computing with many compromised clients to solve puzzles faster than average users. Rivest et al. [26] created a time-lock puzzle that achieves non-parallelizability through the difficulty of parallelizing repeated modular squaring. However, time-lock puzzles are not ideal for DoS defense due to the high cost of puzzle generation and verification at the server.

Ma [27] proposed hash-chain-reversal puzzles at the network layer to prevent DDoS attacks. These puzzles are non-parallelizable because the inversion of digest \(i\) cannot start until the inversion of digest \(i+1\) is complete. However, constructing and verifying puzzle solutions at the server is resource-intensive. Using a hash function with a shorter digest length may not ensure the intended computational effort, while a longer hash length makes the puzzle unsolvable within a reasonable time.

Groza and Petrica [28] introduced another hash-chain puzzle, which also provides non-parallelizability but has several drawbacks. The puzzle construction and verification at the server are expensive, and transmitting the puzzle to the client requires high bandwidth.

Tritilanunt et al. [9] proposed a puzzle based on the subset sum problem, suggesting the use of an improved LLL lattice reduction algorithm [30] for solution computation. However, this approach has high memory requirements and struggles with large instances and high-density problems.

#### Memory-Bound Puzzles
Abadi et al. [32] argued that memory access speed is more uniform across different computer systems than CPU speed, suggesting the use of memory-bound functions in puzzles to ensure consistent puzzle costs. Dwork et al. [33] provided an abstract memory-bound function with a lower bound on the number of memory accesses required for puzzle solutions. Despite these promising results, several issues remain:

1. **Cache Size Assumption**: Memory-bound puzzles assume an upper limit on the attacker's cache size, which may not hold as technology advances. Increasing this limit based on the maximum available cache size makes the puzzles too costly for average clients.
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Deploying memory-bound puzzles requires fine-tuning parameters based on system cache and memory configurations.
3. **Resource Intensive**: Puzzle construction is expensive, and bandwidth consumption per puzzle transmission is high.
4. **Limited Device Compatibility**: Clients with limited memory, such as PDAs and cell phones, cannot use these puzzles and require alternative services for puzzle computation.

#### Related Work Summary
None of the discussed puzzle schemes fully address the resource disparity problem. Additionally, puzzle computation can interfere with concurrently running user applications on client machines, either through cache displacement (memory-bound puzzles) or competition for CPU power (CPU-bound puzzles).

#### Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we demonstrated that most existing cryptographic puzzle schemes do not account for the resource disparity between clients. While some proposals suggest using memory-bound puzzles, their practicality remains an open question. We argued that resource disparity can reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of cryptographic puzzles in defending against DoS attacks. We introduced the guided tour puzzle, showing that it achieves all desired properties of an effective and efficient cryptographic puzzle scheme, including fairness, minimal interference, and better DoS defense.

For future work, we aim to:
1. Eliminate the need for server involvement in puzzle generation. Currently, puzzle construction requires only one hash operation at the server, but we believe this can be eliminated.
2. Investigate optimal ways to position tour guides in the network, as their locations significantly impact the optimality of the guided tour puzzle.
3. Conduct more extensive evaluations of the guided tour puzzle using both simulations and practical network testbeds to further validate our analysis.
