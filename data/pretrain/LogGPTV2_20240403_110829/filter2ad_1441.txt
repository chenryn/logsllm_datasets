**Abstract:**
We propose a novel framework for autonomic intrusion detection that enables online and adaptive detection in unlabeled audit data streams. The framework is self-managing, with capabilities for self-labeling, self-updating, and self-adapting. Aﬃnity Propagation (AP) is used within this framework to learn a subject's behavior through dynamic clustering of the streaming data. Testing results with a large real HTTP log stream demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.

## 1. Problem Statement, Motivation, and Solution

Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in modern network security frameworks. However, due to the continuous evolution of data and the changing nature of normal behavior over time, static anomaly IDSs often become ineffective. Detection models need frequent updates to incorporate new normal examples and adapt to behavioral changes. This presents two main challenges:
1. The scarcity of precisely labeled data, which is difficult to obtain in practice.
2. The streaming nature of the data, which includes behavioral changes.

To address these challenges, we propose an autonomic IDS framework that operates in a self-managing manner, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity from operators. The framework has the ability to self-label, self-update, and self-adapt, enabling it to detect attacks in unlabeled data streams. It assumes that abnormal data is rare, allowing us to "capture" anomalies by identifying outliers in the data streams.

Given a data stream, our method identifies outliers through initial clustering. The detection model consists of clusters of normal data items. Outliers generated during clustering, as well as any incoming outliers that are too far from the current model, are suspected to be attacks. We define three states for a data item: normal, suspicious, and anomalous. If an outlier is identified, it is marked as suspicious and placed into a reservoir. Otherwise, the detection model is updated with normal incoming data until a change is detected, triggering model rebuilding to adapt to the current behavior. A suspicious item is considered truly anomalous if it is again marked as suspicious after adaptation.

## 2. Implementation and Discussion

The autonomic IDS is effective for detecting rare attacks. Detecting bursty attacks, however, is more challenging because the attack scenario does not align well with the assumption of rareness. To address this, we have designed two additional mechanisms:
1. If a data item is very far from the model, it is immediately flagged as anomalous rather than being marked as suspicious.
2. If the percentage of outliers exceeds a threshold (e.g., 60%) during a given time period, a change is triggered, leading to prompt model rebuilding.

We use Aﬃnity Propagation (AP) and StrAP to detect bursty attacks within the framework. We tested the method using a real HTTP log stream, where the character distribution of each HTTP request was used as the feature. The data contains 40,095 requests, including 239 attacks occurring in a very short interval (requests 7923-9743). For comparison, we also used three static methods: k-NN, PCA, and one-class SVM. The first 800 attack-free requests were used for training the static models, while the first 800 requests were used for AP initial clustering. The testing results, shown in Figure 1, indicate that the autonomic detection method outperforms the other three static methods, achieving higher detection rates when they exceed 50%. Notably, the autonomic IDS does not require a priori knowledge, whereas static methods need labeled data for training. Future work will focus on combining the autonomic IDS with effective static methods to prevent mimicry attacks, such as implementing large-scale attacks to evade the autonomic IDS.
