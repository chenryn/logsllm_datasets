The project at <https://github.com/crabtw/rust-bindgen> is highly valuable and should be included in the toolset distributed with `rustc`.

Additionally, it may be the right time to consider bundling `libclang` with `rustc`. This would not only support `rust-bindgen` but also facilitate other forms of integration, such as with our driver and `cargo`.
