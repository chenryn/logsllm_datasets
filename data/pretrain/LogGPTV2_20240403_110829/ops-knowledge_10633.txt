User: When I run a program from a USB memory, and remove the USB memory the program still goes on running (I mean with out really copying the program into the Windows PC).
However, does the program make its copy inside the Windows in any hidden location or temporary folder while running by the python IDLE. From where the python IDLE receive the code to be running after removing the USB memory? I am going to run python program in a public shared PC so I do not want anyone find out my code, I just want to run it, and get the result next day. Does someone can get my code even I remove the USB memory?
Assistant: It sounds like you are doing something you probably shouldn't be doing.  Depending on how much people want your code they could go as far as physically freezing the ram and doing a forensic IT analysis.  In short, you can't prevent code cloning on a machine you don't administer.
