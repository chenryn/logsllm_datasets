User: I'm trying to create a python shell script to create a number of directories in Ubuntu Linux. The main directory I'm trying to create directories in is protected from write access. Is there a way to allow the Python script to be allowed to create directories in there as if it's the root user but not have to run the script through su, since other users might need to run the script but should not have su access?
Assistant: Unfortunately no. A process's permissions in a *nix environment are always less than or equal to the permissions of the person who fires it. This actually makes sense though -- it is a huge security risk to allow processes exceed the user's own abilities. 
This will require someone who has access to that directory -- either through one of their groups or through sudo. Either way, it will require human interaction on every machine that the script is run on.
As far as what is easiest, well, you'll need someone who has that authority to grant it to another user, or simply use sudo directly.
