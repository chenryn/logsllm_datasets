The language service does not provide any suggestions in the following line of code:

```typescript
const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper') as H
```

I expected `H` to be recognized as `HTMLElement`. The suggestion appears only if I type a semicolon (`;`) and then type `H`.

To improve clarity and ensure the type is correctly inferred, you can explicitly specify the type as follows:

```typescript
const wrapper = document.querySelector('.wrapper') as HTMLElement;
```

This way, the type is clearly defined, and the language service should provide appropriate suggestions.
