Flow statistics obtained from a regional ISP,4 the 56% iden-
tiﬁed ASs were responsible for 99% of all trafﬁc observed
by this ISP. This suggests that our methodology works well
for the set of ASs that are responsible for the bulk of Inter-
net trafﬁc, but is of limited use for the many small ASs that
contribute little to the overall trafﬁc volume.
As the Internet continues to evolve, so does an AS’s busi-
ness model. However, since our proposed methodology re-
lies mainly on being able to (1) identify the most “generic”
business elements shared by existing ASs, and (2) infer
each of these business elements by relying on appropri-
ate “surrogate” measurements (or direct measurements, if
available), we argue that our approach will remain applica-
ble under changing Internet conditions (e.g., emergence of
new “killer” applications), at least as long as generic busi-
ness elements can be deﬁned and viable surrogate measure-
ments can be identiﬁed.
4 AS Business Characterization
From Tables 3, 4, and 6, one can see that some ASs
rank very high with respect to more than one utility (e.g.,
Deutsche Telekom appears in all three), whereas other ASs
rank high in only one category (e.g., Amazon in Web host-
ing, and Comcast in residential access). To compare these
multi-variate AS utility proﬁles, and to associate each AS
with one of the seven proﬁles listed in Table 1, we in-
troduce the following quantitative metric. We ﬁrst con-
vert the ranks Rweb(X), RRA(X), and RBA(X) of an AS
into their normalized counterparts, denoted by rweb(X),
rRA(X), and rBA(X), respectively. More speciﬁcally,
we set rweb(X) = Rweb(X)/max{Rweb(i), i ∈ set of
all ASs}, so that 0 ≤ rweb(X) ≤ 1.0.
If Rweb(X) is
unknown, we set it to max{Rweb(i)}, reﬂecting our in-
tuition that X has negligible web utility, so that in this
case, rweb(X) = 1.0. Likewise for rRA(X) and rBA(X).
We then deﬁne the rank vector R(X) corresponding to AS
X as R(X) , (rweb(X), rRA(X), rBA(X)). Note that
R(X) can be interpreted as a point in the 3-dimensional
hypercube, with the seven business models listed in Ta-
ble 1 representing the extreme or corner points (i.e.,
(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), . . . , (1, 1, 0)) of this hypercube,
where 0 and 1 corresponds to “H” and “L” respectively.
Intuitively, the business model of an AS X is determined
by the minimal distance between its rank vector R(X) and
the seven corner points. For example, as the rank vector
R(X) gets closer to (1, 0, 1), the business model of AS X
is considered to be increasingly that of a residential access
provider.
In Table 7, we list the top 10 North American ASs for
each of the seven business models presented in Table 1.
The top-10 ASs in the “Tier-1” category are those whose
rank vectors are closest to the (0, 0, 0) point in the 3D hy-
percube. Likewise for the remaining six categories. We
observe that, ﬁrst, ASs that are dominant in all three util-
ity categories are indeed well-known tier-1 ASs. Second,
in the “Network access” category where the primary utili-
ties of the ASs are to provide Internet access to both busi-
ness and residential customers, several of the high-ranking
ASs are telecom companies. Third, the business proﬁle
of educational institutions falls under the “Retail service”
category, where the primary utilities of an AS are to pro-
vide both Web hosting and residential access. Networks
belonging to educational institutions usually host various
academic web sites and at the same time provide Inter-
net access to students living in university-owned housing.
Fourth, several educational and research ASs are catego-
rized under “Business access.” These ASs serve purely as
backbone networks connecting other smaller institutions’
networks.
Next, we examine the correlation between the three utili-
ties of an AS, for example, is an AS hosting a large volume
of popular web content likely to serve a large number of
residential customers as well? We use Kendall’s rank cor-
relation coefﬁcient [12] to quantify these pairwise correla-
tions. For samples (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , (Xn, Yn) from
a bivariate distribution, Kendall’s (sample) τ coefﬁcient is
deﬁned as Pi Pi 0, and −1 if x < 0. Kendall’
τ provides a distribution-free measure of the strength of
the association between two variables (i.e., monotonicity
between two variables). The traditional Pearson product-
moment correlation coefﬁcient is less useful if Gaussian
assumptions do not hold for the random variables at hand,
as is the case for Uweb, URA, and UBA. To visualize the re-
lationships between the three inferred utilities, we show in

Fig. 3 pairwise scatterplots for Uweb, URA, and UBA. The
graphs show that there exists non-negligible correlation be-
tween each pair of utilities.
Table 8 lists the resulting Kendall’s (sample) τ values
for pairwise correlations between Uweb, URA, and UBA.
By calculating the pairwise correlation for the three geo-
graphic regions separately, we ﬁnd that in the European and
Asia-Paciﬁc regions, the correlation between “residential
access” and “business access” is higher than the other two
pairwise correlations. As hypothesized earlier, this higher
correlation may be due to dominance of the ISP market in
