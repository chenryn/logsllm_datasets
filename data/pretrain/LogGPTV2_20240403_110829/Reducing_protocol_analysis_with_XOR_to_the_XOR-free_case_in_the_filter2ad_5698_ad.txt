norm and a C-dominated,
standard term m /∈ C⊕
norm in normal form. In this case, we
can choose σ(x) = d ⊕ x according to (ii). With θ(cid:48)(x) = m,
we obtain (cid:112)tθ(cid:113) = (cid:112)c ⊕ d(cid:113) ⊕ m = ((cid:112)tσ(cid:113))θ(cid:48).
If θ(x) were
d ∈ C⊕
norm, then (iii) would be applied.
We can show:
Lemma 12. For a C-dominated term t, the set Σ(t) can
be computed in exponential time in the size of t.
We are now ready to deﬁne the reduction function which
turns T into T +. The Horn theory T + is given in Fig. 2.
With the results shown above, it is clear that T + can be
constructed in exponential time from T . The Horn clauses
in (6)–(9) simulate the ⊕-rule in case the terms we consider
are C-dominated. The other rules in T are simulated by
the rules in (5), which are constructed in such a way that
they allow us to produce messages in normal form for input
messages in normal form.
We can now state the main theorem of this paper. This
theorem states that a message (a secret) can be derived from
T using derivations modulo XOR if and only if it can be
derived from T + using only syntactic derivations, i.e., no
algebraic properties of XOR are taken into account. As
mentioned, this allows to reduce the problem of verifying
secrecy for cryptographic protocols with XOR, to the XOR-
free case. The latter problem can then be handled by tools,
such as ProVerif, which otherwise could not deal with XOR.
Theorem 1. For a C-dominated Horn theory T and C-
dominated message b in normal form, we have: T (cid:96)⊕ b if
and only if T + (cid:96) b.
Before we prove this theorem, we illustrate the reduction
by our running example.
4.2 Example
Consider the Horn theory TPNSL⊕ of our running example.
As mentioned in Section 3, this Horn theory is C-dominated
for C = {a, b}. In what follows, we illustrate how T +
looks like, where the elements of C are ordered as a <C b.
PNSL⊕
PNSL⊕
First, consider the instances of Horn clauses of TPNSL⊕
given by (5). Only the Horn clauses in (3) have fragile
subterms. All other Horn clauses have only one instance
in T +
: the rule itself. This is because for such Horn
clauses Σ(·) contains only one substitution, the identity.
The Horn clause in (3) has one fragile subterm, namely
x. Hence, the domain of every substitution in the corre-
sponding Σ-set is {x}, and according to Deﬁnition 4, this
set contains the following eight substitutions: item (i) gives
σ1 = {x/x}; item (ii) gives σ2 = {a ⊕ x/x}, σ3 = {b ⊕ x/x},
and σ4 = {(a ⊕ b) ⊕ x/x};
item (iii) gives σ5 = {0/x},
σ6 = {a/x}, σ7 = {b/x}, and σ8 = {a ⊕ b/x}. For each of
these substitutions we obtain an instance of (3). For exam-
ple, σ4 yields
I({|(cid:104)(a ⊕ b) ⊕ x, a(cid:105)|}pub(skb)) → I({|(cid:104)m(b, a), a ⊕ x(cid:105)|}pub(ska)).
Now, consider the Horn clauses induced by (6)–(9). For
example, the set of Horn clauses (8) contains among others:
I(a⊕b), I(b⊕x) → I(a⊕x) and I(b), I(a⊕x) → I((a⊕b)⊕x).
4.3 Proof of Theorem 1
In what follows, let T be a C-dominated Horn theory and
b be a C-dominated message in normal form. Note that
(cid:112)b(cid:113) = b. The following lemma proves that our reduction is
sound, i.e., that T + (cid:96) b implies T (cid:96)⊕ b.
Lemma 13. If π is a syntactic derivation for b from T +,
then π is a derivation for b from T modulo XOR.
Proof. Let π be a syntactic derivation for b from T +.
To prove the lemma it suﬃces to prove that each π(i) can
be obtained by a derivation modulo XOR from T and π<i.
If π(i) is obtained from π(j) and π(k) for j, k < i, using one
of the Horn clauses (6)–(9), then we can apply the ⊕-rule
with π(j) and π(k) to obtain π(j) ⊕ π(i) ∼ π(i).
Now, suppose that π(i) is obtained using a Horn clause in
(5) of the form (cid:112)r1σ(cid:113), . . . , (cid:112)rnσ(cid:113) → (cid:112)r0σ(cid:113) for some Horn
clause (r1, . . . , rn → r0) ∈ T and some σ ∈ Σ((cid:104)r0, . . . , rn(cid:105)).
for each k ∈
Hence, there exists a substitution θ and,
{1, . . . , n}, there exists j < i such that π(j) = (cid:112)rkσ(cid:113)θ ∼
(rkσ)θ = rk(σθ). So, we can use the rule r1, . . . , rn → r0
to obtain r0(σθ) = (r0σ)θ ∼ (cid:112)r0σ(cid:113)θ = π(i). Note that
(cid:112)t(cid:113) ∼ t and if t ∼ t(cid:48), then tσ ∼ t(cid:48)σ for all terms t, t(cid:48) and
substitutions σ.
To prove the completeness of our reduction, i.e., that T (cid:96)⊕ b
implies T + (cid:96) b, we ﬁrst prove the property of Σ(t) men-
tioned before Deﬁnition 4. For this, we need the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5. Let t be a C-dominated term and θ be
a C-dominated, ground substitution in normal form with
(cid:112)r1σ(cid:113), . . . , (cid:112)rnσ(cid:113) → (cid:112)r0σ(cid:113)
) → I((cid:112)c ⊕ c

dom(θ) = var(t). Let σ = σ(t, θ) be the substitution deﬁned
as follows. The domain of σ is the set of all variables that
occur in some s ∈ F(t). Let x be such a variable. We de-
ﬁne σ(x) according to the following conditions, which have
decreasing priority:
(a) If there exists s ∈ F(t) with x ∈ var(s) such that sθ ∈
C⊕, then σ(x) = θ(x).
(b) Otherwise, if x ∈ F(t) and θ(x) = c⊕ s(cid:48), for c ∈ C⊕ and
some standard term s(cid:48) not in C⊕, then σ(x) = c ⊕ x.
(Note that c (cid:54)= 0 since θ(x) is in normal form.)
(c) Otherwise, σ(x) = x. (Note that in this case we know
that θ(x) is some standard term not in C⊕ if x ∈ F (t).)
Equipped with this deﬁnition, we can show the property of
Σ(t) mentioned before Deﬁnition 4.
Lemma 14. Let t be a C-dominated term and θ be
a C-dominated, ground substitution in normal form with
dom(θ) = var(t). Then, σ = σ(t, θ) ∈ Σ(t) and there ex-
ists a substitution θ(cid:48) such that θ = σθ(cid:48), i.e., θ(x) = σ(x)θ(cid:48)
for every x ∈ dom(θ), and (cid:112)t(cid:48)θ(cid:113) = (cid:112)t(cid:48)σ(cid:113)θ(cid:48) for every subterm
t(cid:48) of t.
We can now show the completeness of our reduction.
Lemma 15. If π is a C-dominated derivation for b from T
modulo XOR, then (cid:112)π(cid:113) is a syntactic derivation for b from
T +.
Proof. We show that every (cid:112)π(i)(cid:113) can be derived syn-
tactically from T + and (cid:112)π<i(cid:113). Two cases are distinguished:
Case 1: π(i) is obtained from π(j) = I(t) and π(k) = I(s),
for j, k < i, using the ⊕-rule. In that case π(i) ∼ I(t⊕s). By
assumption t, s, and t ⊕ s are C-dominated, and hence, (cid:112)t(cid:113),
(cid:112)s(cid:113), (cid:112)t⊕ s(cid:113) are either normalized standard terms not in C⊕,
terms in C⊕
norm and a
normalized standard term u /∈ C⊕, respectively. However, it
is not the case that (cid:112)t(cid:113) = c⊕u or (cid:112)t(cid:113) = u and (cid:112)s(cid:113) = u(cid:48) /∈ C⊕
or (cid:112)s(cid:113) = c(cid:48) ⊕ u(cid:48) with u (cid:54)= u(cid:48) since otherwise (cid:112)t ⊕ s(cid:113) would
not be C-dominated. Now, it is easy to see that ⊕-rule can
be simulated by one of the Horn clauses (6)–(9).
norm, or terms of the form c⊕ u for c ∈ C⊕
Case 2: π(i) is obtained using some C-dominated rule
(r1, . . . , rn → r0) ∈ T and a ground substitution θ. Since
π is C-dominated, by Lemma 6 and 3 we may assume that
θ is C-dominated. Since π is a derivation modulo XOR,
we may also assume that θ is in normal form. We have
that π(i) ∼ r0θ and there exist j1, . . . , jn < i such that
π(jk) ∼ rkθ, for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Let σ = σ((cid:104)r0, . . . , rn(cid:105), θ) and let θ(cid:48) be as speciﬁed in
Lemma 14. By Lemma 14, σ ∈ Σ((cid:104)r0, . . . , rn(cid:105)). Now, to
obtain (cid:112)π(i)(cid:113), we can use the rule ρ = ((cid:112)r1σ(cid:113), . . . , (cid:112)rnσ(cid:113) →
(cid:112)r0σ(cid:113)) ∈ T + with the substitution θ(cid:48). In fact, by Lemma 14,
we have that (cid:112)rkσ(cid:113)θ(cid:48) = (cid:112)rkθ(cid:113) = (cid:112)π(jk)(cid:113) for all k ∈
{0, . . . , n}, where j0 = 0.
(Recall that for C-dominated
terms s and t with s ∼ t, we have that (cid:112)s(cid:113) = (cid:112)t(cid:113).)
Now, from the above lemma and Proposition 1 it immedi-
ately follows that T (cid:96)⊕ b implies T + (cid:96) b.
5. AUTHENTICATION
In the previous section, we showed how to reduce the
derivation problem modulo XOR for C-dominated Horn the-
ories to the syntactic derivation problem. While the deriva-
tion problem corresponds to the secrecy problem for crypto-
graphic protocols w.r.t. an unbounded number of sessions,
in this section, we will see that it is not hard to extend our
result to authentication properties.
Authentication as correspondence assertions. Au-
thentication properties are often expressed as correspon-
dence assertions of the form end(x) → begin(x) where x
describes the parameters on which the begin and end events
should agree. This correspondence should be read as fol-
lows: If event end(x) has occurred, then also event begin(x).
For example, end(a, b, n) → begin(a, b, n) could be inter-
preted as: If b thinks to have ﬁnished a run of a protocol
with a in which the nonce n was used (in this case event
end(a, b, n) occurred), then a has actually run a protocol
with b in which n was used (in this case event begin(a, b, n)
occurred). To check such correspondence assertions in the
Horn theory based approach, roughly speaking, the protocol
rules are augmented with atoms representing events of the
form begin(x) and end(x) (see, e.g., [3] for details).
Now, let T be a Horn theory model of a protocol and
an intruder. Following Blanchet [3], we say that a (non-
injective) correspondence assertion of the form end(x) →
begin(x) is satisﬁed by T if
for every ﬁnite set of messages B and every mes-
B}(cid:54) (cid:96)⊕ end(m0),
sage m0 /∈ bB, it holds that T ∪ {begin(m) | m ∈
where bB = {t | there exists t(cid:48) ∈ B and t ∼ t(cid:48)}.
In [3],
this formulation (more precisely, a syntactic version, i.e.,
the XOR-free version) is somewhat implicit in a theorem
which reduces correspondence assertions in process calcu-
lus to Horn theories. Blanchet then proposes a method for
proving the syntactic version of (10) using ProVerif.
(10)
Extending our reduction to correspondence asser-
tions. The following theorem extends our reduction pre-
sented in Section 4 to the problem of solving (10) with XOR.
In fact, we show that if in (10) the (C-dominated) Horn
theory T is replaced by T + (i.e., we can use the same re-
duction function as in Section 4), then derivation modulo
XOR ( (cid:96)⊕ ) can be replaced by syntactic derivation ( (cid:96) ).
Now, the latter problem (the syntactic version of (10)) can
be solved using ProVerif. Formally, we can prove:
Theorem 2. Let T be a C-dominated Horn theory. Then,
(10) holds iﬀ for every ﬁnite set of messages B and every
message m0 /∈ B, it holds that T + ∪ {begin(m) | m ∈ B} (cid:54)(cid:96)
end(m0).
The proof of this theorem requires some slight extension of
Proposition 1 in which an injective version of ∆ is used, i.e.,
t (cid:54)= t(cid:48) should imply that ∆(t) (cid:54)= ∆(t(cid:48)). This is needed to
guarantee that if m0 /∈ B, then ∆(m0) /∈ ∆(B).
6. EXPERIMENTS
We have implemented our reduction, and together with
ProVerif, tested it on a set of protocols which employ the
XOR operator. In this section, we report on our implemen-
tation and the experimental results.
6.1
Implementation
We have implemented our reduction function in SWI Pro-
log (version 5.6.14). Our implementation essentially takes
a Horn theory as input. More precisely, the input consists
of (1) a declaration of all the functor symbols used in the
protocol and by the intruder, (2) the initial intruder facts
as well as the protocol and intruder rules, except for the
⊕-rule, which is assumed implicitly, (3) a statement which
deﬁnes a secrecy or authentication goal. Moreover, options
that are handed over to ProVerif may be added.
Our implementation then ﬁrst checks whether the given
Horn theory, say T , (part (2) of the input) is ⊕-linear. If it is
not, an error message is returned. If it is, a set C (of minimal
size) is computed such that the Horn theory is C-dominated.
Recall that such a set always exists if the Horn theory is ⊕-
linear. It is important to keep C as small as possible, in order
