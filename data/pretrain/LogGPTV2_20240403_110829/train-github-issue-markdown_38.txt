`` does not work correctly in
Chrome. When user type in a decimal point `.`, the point will disappear and
the caret will be be reset to the beginning of the input. If you keep typing
in `.` twice, the value of input will disappear. However, if a input has no
defaultValue, it seems to work fine.
I've put together a fiddle page to demo the bug:

I think it has something to do with the internal state management of an
uncontrolled component. When the first `.` is typed, it does not get to
`target.value` (chrome may have trimmed the "unnecessary" `.` from the value
because it's type is `number`). React pushing `target.value` back to input
causing the `.` to disappear and caret position reset. Now if two `.` are
typed in, the value is no longer a valid number and Chrome may return `''` for
`target.value`, causing the input to be reset.
