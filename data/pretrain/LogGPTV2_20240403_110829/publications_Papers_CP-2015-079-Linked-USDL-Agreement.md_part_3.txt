penalties are usually defined in SLAs. Furthermore, these
criteria are also those that are fulfilled by less proposals
with no more than 2 different proposals fulfilling each of
them except for recovery actions, which are supported by
4 proposals. This reinforces our belief that they are only
useful in a very limited set of scenarios.
Nevertheless, due to the nature of our modelling ap-
proach, new extensions to Linked USDL Agreement can
be seamlessly integrated in order to provide these ad-
vanced features in scenarios that require them. For in-
stance, one might design a negotiation-related extension
that extends the ServiceOffering with information
about the negotiation process and the Guarantee with
information about its negotiability.
