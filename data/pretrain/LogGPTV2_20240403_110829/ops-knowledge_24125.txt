User: How to monitor the performance and status of each instance in the cloud platform by accessing the web management interface or command line interface? Please describe common monitoring metrics and monitoring tools.
Assistant: By accessing the web management interface or the command line interface, various monitoring tools can be used to monitor the performance and status of each instance in the cloud platform. Common monitoring indicators include: 1. CPU utilization: monitor the CPU utilization of the instance to ensure that the system is not overloaded. 2. Memory utilization: Monitor the memory usage of the instance to ensure that the system does not experience memory leaks or memory exhaustion. 3. Hard disk utilization: Monitor the hard disk usage of the instance to ensure that the hard disk is not used up. 4. Network traffic: Monitor the inbound and outbound network traffic of the instance to ensure that the network is not full. Common monitoring tools include: 1. Nagios: A commonly used open source network monitoring tool that can monitor all mainstream network components. 2. Zabbix: A network monitoring tool that supports distributed environments and automated configuration. 3. Prometheus: An open source monitoring solution for cloud-native environments that supports multiple data sources. 4. Grafana: An open source data visualization tool that can be integrated with other monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) to provide highly customized monitoring and visualization functions.
