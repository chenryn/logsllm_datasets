### 4.1 A View into Wireless Neighborhoods

Our study revealed a significant number of unencrypted access points (APs) in the neighborhoods. The first pass of the Mark-and-Sweep method identified 1200 APs in SQ and 965 APs in RMT. Approximately 30% of these APs were unencrypted. A similar study conducted in Pittsburgh in 2005 [3] showed that the percentage of encrypted APs increased from 50% to 70% over two years. This increase is likely due to heightened awareness of security and privacy, as well as vendors shipping APs with default security settings. However, we have not yet observed widespread use of both encrypted and unencrypted APs, which could stabilize or even reverse the trend of increasing encryption.

Figure 2(a) shows the locations of all discovered APs in RMT, while Figure 2(b) highlights ISPs associated with open and internet-available APs.

#### Vendor Influence on Neighborhood Security

Using the MAC addresses of the discovered APs, we calculated the fraction of vendor APs that were encrypted. Table 3 summarizes our findings:

| Vendor | # of APs Seen | % Encrypted |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Linksys | 977 | 64.48% |
| Actiontec Electronics | 383 | 97.91% |
| Netgear | 264 | 76.14% |
| AboCom Systems | 249 | 77.51% |
| D-Link | 232 | 55.17% |
| Apple | 161 | 71.43% |
| Belkin | 112 | 67.86% |
| Cisco | 81 | 54.32% |
| Agere Systems | 38 | 5.26% |

With two exceptions, the fraction of encrypted APs does not strongly correlate with the vendor. The exceptions are Agere Systems, whose APs were rarely encrypted, and Actiontec Electronics, whose APs were almost always encrypted. This finding is intriguing because other vendors also ship APs with default encryption, but do not achieve the same high encryption rates once deployed. One key difference is that Verizon ships pre-configured Actiontec APs to their customers, reducing the likelihood that customers will disable encryption during configuration or troubleshooting.

### 4.2 Last-mile Internet Connection

Table 2 shows that while both neighborhoods had around 300 unencrypted APs, the number of APs tested in the second pass was much smaller. This is because only APs with an SNR over 20 dB were selected. Further reductions occurred due to association and DHCP failures, leaving 195 APs for detailed broadband measurements.

Residential network speeds are increasing, as shown in Table 4, which lists the ISPs accessible via open APs in the two neighborhoods. We used the domain name of the external IP address to identify the ISP and classified APs by their ISP and the type of technology they use (e.g., cable, DSL, or fiber). We noticed that neighborhood networks are not limited to slow-speed cable and DSL connections and may feature high-capacity fiber lines. Additionally, RMT has more cable links than DSL links, likely due to the range limitations of DSL.

Cable throughput is higher and more variable than DSL throughput. Using nuttcp, we computed the maximum instantaneous UDP throughput sustained through the broadband link for one second during a 4-second measurement duration. To reliably estimate the broadband capacity, we ensured that the measurements were not artificially limited by the wireless link.

### 4.3 Home Network

Wireless APs often serve as the hub of residential networks, acting as NATs that gateway to the Internet. As more devices become 802.11 enabled, we expect wireless access points to play a greater role in home networks. In this section, we examine two specific configuration parameters: DNS and NAT.

#### DNS Configuration

During the second pass, our tool recorded DHCP lease information. 47% of the 215 DHCP-capable access points advertised DNS resolvers only in the local private address space. 48% used only remote/public DNS, and 5% used both local and remote DNS. 99% of the remote DNS servers were provided by the direct upstream ISP. Using ip2geo [1], we found that only 2.5% of the remote DNS servers were located far away, while 97.5% were in Pittsburgh, Virginia, or New Jersey. This suggests that techniques like content distribution networks (e.g., Akamai) work well for residential users. There is a strong correlation between vendors and DNS settings.

#### NAT Behavior

To characterize NAT behavior, we used the open-source STUN client/server [2]. Out of 189 APs tested, 4 could not be tested. Table 5 classifies the remaining 185 APs, all of which used NAT. RFC 4787 [4] describes the Best Current Practices for NATs. Interestingly, 16 out of 185 NAT-enabled APs (9%) did not use endpoint-independent port/address mapping, and over half (51%) did not support hairpinning, both required by the RFC. Most of these violations are specific to a small number of vendors.

### 4.4 Neighborhood Network

The strength of our two-pass measurement is that it allows us to characterize the wireless and Internet connectivity of a neighborhood as a whole, providing useful insights for neighbor-aware or neighbor-cooperative system design and deployment strategies.

#### Open APs and ISP Coverage

Open APs offer diverse access to the dominant ISPs in the region. Community WiFi deployments and collaborative wireless access schemes raise questions about the use of neighborhood networks for collaborative access to one or multiple ISPs for roaming, bandwidth sharing, or improved reliability. Figure 4 shows that open APs attached to Verizon and Comcast offer 96% coverage in SQ and 48% coverage in RMT, which has a lower population density.

#### Robustness to ISP Outages

Another application is making residential Internet access robust to access link and neighborhood-wide failures. The performance of such a system depends on the number of wireless hops required to reach an AP served by a different ISP. We measured the distance from every point on the map to a "secondary" ISP using the nearest AP to determine the "primary" ISP. The median distance to the "secondary" ISP was 93m and 150m for SQ and RMT, respectively. The median difference between the distance to the "primary" ISP and the "secondary" ISP was low in both neighborhoods: 26m and 68m for SQ and RMT, respectively. This suggests that alternate-ISP schemes could be feasible, assuming technical and legal barriers can be overcome.

### 5. Conclusion

Mark-and-Sweep is a new tool for measuring residential wireless and broadband network properties. Its two-pass method—quickly finding all access points in an area followed by detailed measurements from targeted locations—provides equivalent accuracy to previous methods in a fraction of the time. Our initial experience with Mark-and-Sweep produced several interesting insights, such as vendor influence on wireless security, NAT RFC non-compliance, 802.11n penetration, and coverage provided by open APs.
