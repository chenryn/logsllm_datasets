4.1 A View into Wireless Neighborhoods
Neighborhoods feature a large number of unencrypted
APs. The ﬁrst pass of Mark-and-Sweep revealed 1200 APs
for SQ and 965 APs for RMT (Table 2). 30% were unen-
crypted. A similar study based on pass 1 measurements was
carried out in Pittsburgh in 2005 [3]; over two years, the
percentage of encrypted APs increased from 50% to 70%. We
believe this is partly due to increased awareness in security
and privacy as well as vendors shipping APs with security
settings. However, we have yet to see more sophisticated
usage of APs that allows users to have both encrypted and
unencrypted APs.4 Such usage pattern may stabilize or even
reverse the trend of increasing percentage of encrypted APs.
The APs for a part of RMT are shown in Figure 2(a). The
right-hand ﬁgure (b) shows ISPs associated to open and
Internet available APs.
Vendor/ISP partnerships inﬂuence neighborhood
security. Using the MAC address of the discovered APs we
computed the fraction of vendor APs that were encrypted.
Our results are shown in Table 3. With two exceptions,
the fraction of encrypted APs does not correlate strongly
with AP vendor; approximately 60%-70% of the APs were
encrypted regardless of the vendor. The two exceptions were
Agere systems APs, which were rarely encrypted, and Action-
tec Electronics, whose APs were almost always encrypted.
This ﬁnding was intriguing, since other APs also ship with
encryption by default but do not achieve the same fraction
once deployed (e.g., only 71% of Apple APs were encrypted).
One key diﬀerence is that Verizon ships pre-conﬁgured Ac-
tiontec APs to their customers, which appears to reduce
the chance that the customer might disable encryption dur-
ing conﬁguration or debugging performance or connectivity
problems.

Table 4: ISP distribution of open Access Points
Open APs cover up to 98% of the urban area. Us-
ing the measurements collected in pass 1 we estimate each
AP’s coverage range by computing the distance between the
location of the AP’s strongest signal measurement and the
farthest location where the AP was heard at a SNR over
20 dB. The maximum ranges of APs for SQ and RMT were
327 m and 507 m and median values were 152 m and 80 m
respectively. Using the individual coverage areas computed
for each AP5, we then compute the fraction of the wardriven
area with 802.11 connectivity to Internet available open APs.
Surprisingly, 98% of SQ had access to an open AP, as did
48% of RMT. As can be seen in Figure 2(a), the discovered
(but not necessarily open) APs provide 100% geographic
coverage.
802.11n has started penetrating neighborhoods. A
small percentage of the APs supported 802.11n (which has a
claimed eﬀective throughput up to 130 Mbps). While IEEE
802.11n is still a draft standard, up to 6% of the APs in SQ,
and 2.2% in RMT, support it.
4.2 Last-mile Internet Connection
Table 2 shows that while both neighborhoods had almost
300 unencrypted APs, the number of APs tested in pass 2
was much smaller. The diﬀerence arises from selecting only
APs whose SNR is over 20 dB. AP association and DHCP
failures further reduce the number of locations where we can
collect detailed broadband measurements to 195.
Residential network speeds are increasing. Table 4
lists the ISPs accessible via open APs in the two neighbor-
hoods. We use the domain name of the external IP address
to identify the ISP. We then classify APs by their ISP and by
the type of technology they use (e.g., cable, DSL, or ﬁber).
We notice that neighborhood networks are not constrained
to slow speed cable and DSL connections, but may feature
high capacity ﬁber lines. In addition, RMT appears to feature
a much higher number of cable links than DSL links, which
is probably an artifact of the range limitations of DSL.
Cable throughput is higher and more variable than
DSL throughput. Using nuttcp we compute the maximum
instantaneous UDP throughput sustained through the broad-
band link for one second during a 4 second measurement
duration.
(We chose 4 seconds to balance measurement
quality with the amount of time and intrusiveness of the
measurement.) To reliably estimate the broadband capacity,
however, requires that the measurements are not artiﬁcially
4APs from Meraki and British Telecom allow to have en-
crypted and non-encrypted APs at the same time.
5We trim very large range numbers to the median observed
range to avoid over-estimating coverage.

clearly at the right of the ﬁgure. More detailed and longer
term measurements will be required to discern those two
eﬀects. Having said that, Mark-and-Sweep could use any
throughput estimation technique in order to obtain a more
accurate view.
4.3 Home Network
Wireless APs often also serve as the hub of the residential
network, in many cases also acting as NATs that gateway to
the Internet. We expect that wireless access points will play
a greater role in in-home networks as an increasing number
of devices, such as printers, PDAs, storage devices, and even
HDTVs, become 802.11 enabled. In this section, we take a
deeper look into home networks by looking at two speciﬁc
conﬁguration parameters, regarding DNS and NAT.
Most home users do not change their ISP provided
DNS conﬁguration. During pass 2, our tool records DHCP
lease information. 47% of the 215 DHCP-able access points
advertised DNS resolvers only in the local private address
space. 48% of them were using only remote/public DNS,
and 5% used both local and remote DNS. 99% of the remote
DNS servers were provided by the direct upstream ISP. We
further examined whether these DNS servers were located
in close proximity to the wireless network using ip2geo [1]
which maps IPs to geographical area. Surprisingly, only
2.5% of the remote DNS servers were located far away (e.g.,
Georgia, Washington). 97.5% of the servers were located in
Pittsburgh, Virginia, or New Jersey. Previous studies have
shown that an appreciable fraction of computers use quite
remote DNS servers [7]. Many content distribution networks
(e.g., Akamai) use the source address of a DNS query to
direct users to a nearby content replica. Our results suggest
that these techniques work particularly well for residential
users. Further analysis also showed that there is a strong
correlation between vendors and DNS settings.
NAT implementations violate the RFC. To charac-
terize the behavior of NATs, we used the open source STUN
client/server [2]. Out of 189 APs that we tested, 4 could
not be tested since they reported that the server was not
reachable or blocked. Table 5 shows a classiﬁcation of the re-
maining 185, all of which used NAT. RFC 4787 [4] describes
the Best Current Practices for NATs with respect to these
properties. Interestingly, 16 out of 185 NAT-enabled APs
(9%) did not use endpoint-independent port/address map-
Figure 3: Broadband link bandwidth estimation
limited by the wireless link. We ensure this by using the
packet trace collected on the monitor interface to compute the
eﬀective wireless transmission rate. We compute the amount
of time required for the transmission of each packet at the
reported MAC layer tx-rate and remove retransmissions. If
the computed wireless rate is over 10 Mbps, we assume the
measurements are wired-bottlenecked. If the number is be-
tween 5 and 10 Mbps, we compare it with the measured UDP
throughput. If the throughput is more than half the average
transmission rate, then we assume that wireless is not the
bottleneck and accept the estimated bandwidth number. For
all other cases, we assume the collected measurements are
biased by the wireless quality. Figure 3 shows upload and
download bandwidth for DSL and cable for SQ.
As expected, cable throughput speeds appear higher than
those of DSL, and upload speeds are much smaller than
download. The incumbent cable provider, Comcast, oﬀers 6
and 12 Mbps connectivity, which is signiﬁcantly higher than
the 3 Mbps oﬀered by the incumbent DSL provider. Identi-
fying the available rates is harder for cable, which we believe
may be due to cable modems sharing more throughput with
neighbors and, as a result, actually oﬀering lower throughput
than advertised [6]. On the other hand, Comcast’s “12 Mbps
for the ﬁrst ten megabytes” Powerboost service shows up

(51%) of the APs did not support hairpinning, also required
by the RFC (REQ-9). The overwhelming majority of these
RFC violations are speciﬁc to a small number of vendors.
4.4 Neighborhood Network
The strength of our 2 pass measurement is that it allows
us to characterize wireless and Internet connectivity of a
neighborhood as a whole, which can provide useful insight
for neighbor-aware or neighbor-cooperative system design
and deployment strategies.
Open APs oﬀer diverse access to the dominant
ISPs in the region. Recent eﬀorts, such as community
WiFi deployments and collaborative wireless access schemes
raise interesting questions about the use of neighborhood
networks for collaborative access to one or multiple ISPs for
roaming (e.g., FON), for bandwidth sharing, or for improved
reliability. We use Mark-and-Sweep measurements to help
shed insight on the practicality of such schemes by identi-
fying the area covered by each AP, and through that, the
area covered by wireless APs serviced by each ISP. Figure 4
shows that open APs attached to Verizon and Comcast oﬀer
96% coverage in SQ and 48% coverage in RMT, which has
a much lower population density. (Note that these results
mean that any area covered by any open wireless point is
covered by either Verizon or Comcast.)
Home networks can be made robust to individual
ISP outages. A second collaborative neighborhood appli-
cation is that of making residential Internet access robust
to access link and neighborhood-wide failures (e.g., a failed
DSLAM or cable head-end). The performance of such a
system depends on the number of wireless hops required
to reach an AP served by a diﬀerent ISP. As a ﬁrst ap-
proximation, we assume that the number of hops is roughly
proportional to distance. We then measure the distance
from every point on the map (actually, a uniform grid of
points) to a “secondary” ISP, using the AP nearest the point
to determine the “primary” ISP. The median distance to
the “secondary” ISP was 93 and 150m for SQ and RMT. We
also observe that the median diﬀerence between the distance
to the “primary” ISP and the distance to the “secondary”
ISP was low in both neighborhoods: 26 and 68 meters for
SQ and the suburban RMT areas, respectively. This very
preliminary measurement suggests that such alternate-ISP
schemes could have traction, assuming the other technical
and legal barriers to their adoption can be overcome.
5. CONCLUSION
Mark-and-Sweep is a new tool for measuring residential
wireless and broadband network properties.
Its two-pass
method—quickly ﬁnding all access points in an area followed
by detailed measurements from targeted locations—provides
equivalent accuracy to previous methods in a fraction of the
time. Our initial experience with Mark-and-Sweep produced
several interesting insights, such as vendor inﬂuence on wire-
less security, NAT RFC non-compliance, 802.11n penetration,
and coverage provided by open APs.
