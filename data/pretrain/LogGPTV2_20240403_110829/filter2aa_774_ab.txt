### ID Making Operating Guide

#### Introduction
Reaching this stage in the ID making process has likely been an interesting, time-consuming, and sometimes frustrating experience. However, it's almost time to admire your hard work. At this point, things start to come together, but there is still a significant amount of work left, particularly in the lamination phase.

#### Lamination
Lamination is a straightforward procedure, but since most laminators differ, you will need to fine-tune the heat settings on your specific machine. Common issues during lamination include bubbling and deformation. To prevent these, adjust the heat settings by either lowering or raising them. Another crucial tip is to place the items being laminated inside a protective pouch. This not only protects the machine but also ensures the quality of your final product. You can create a protective pouch by laminating two pieces of Teslin on one side only. When laminating, place the laminated Teslin sheets on the top and bottom of your batch to prevent deformation.

#### Dye Cutting
The next step is dye cutting, which requires careful attention as it can make or break your newly laminated cards. Do not rush this part, as mistakes will necessitate starting over. Begin by cutting the laminated batch into a manageable size. In this example, I cut two cards from the main page and trimmed them to fit into the dye cutter. Place the uncut cards into the dye cutter and position them carefully. This step takes practice, and it's normal to make mistakes. Be patient and persistent.

#### Magnetic Stripe Encoding
The final step is writing to the magnetic stripe on the back of the newly cut membership card. To verify that the magnetic stripe works, use a magnetic encoder in write mode to input the necessary information with your chosen software. Then, switch the encoder to read mode and slide the card through to ensure the data is correctly encoded.

#### Equipment and Materials
To achieve professional results, you will need a variety of equipment and materials. Here is a detailed list:

**Printers:**
1. **Compatible Inkjet Printer (Epson Stylus R800 Photo Printer):**
   - Epson printers with DuraBrite ink are highly recommended for their compatibility with Teslin.
   - Other suitable printers include the Canon S800, Epson Stylus 800, Epson Stylus C82, Epson Stylus Photo 2200, Epson Stylus Photo 820, and HP 950C.
   - Choose a printer with pigment-based ink for better durability and resistance to fading.

2. **Thermal Printer (Alps MD-1300, MD-1500, or MD-5000):**
   - These printers are no longer in production and can only be found on eBay.
   - They are used for printing full-page holograms.
   - Expect to pay $400-$800 and be prepared for the possibility of receiving a non-functional unit.

**Miscellaneous Equipment:**
3. **HP Inkjet Printer (Optional):**
   - Used for printing UV ink onto the ID.
   - Must be compatible with HP51645a inkjet cartridges.

4. **Laminator:**
   - Invest in a high-quality laminator with temperature control and metal gears.
   - Ensure it can handle at least 8.5 inches across, preferably 10 inches.
   - Budget between $250 and $450 for a reliable laminator.

5. **Dye Cutter:**
   - Essential for cutting the laminated ID into the correct size.
   - Purchase from a reputable supplier like www.brainstormidsupply.com.
   - The cheaper model costs around $390, but order early as it may be on backorder.

6. **Magnetic Stripe Encoder:**
   - Used to encode the magnetic stripe on the ID.
   - Avoid counterfeit products on eBay.
   - Ensure it can write Hi-co and Low-co, and supports tracks 1, 2, and 3.
   - Expect to pay around $600 or more.

7. **Black Light:**
   - Necessary for verifying the presence of ultraviolet ink, which is a common security feature on IDs.

8. **Airbrush (Optional):**
   - For advanced users; will be discussed later.

9. **Chocolate Covered Fuzzy Banana:**
   - An even layer spreading tool for creating holograms.
   - Available at http://practicingperfection.7p.com.

10. **Scanner:**
    - Any image scanner will suffice.

11. **Signature Pad:**
    - A USB peripheral for signing documents directly onscreen.
    - Alternatively, scan a handwritten signature.

12. **Adobe Photoshop:**
    - Or any other desktop photo editing software.
    - The guide assumes you are using CS2.

13. **Computer:**
    - Must have sufficient power to handle multiple print jobs and large Photoshop files.
    - Requires an LPT port for the Alps printer.
    - Consider building a new computer with ample memory if needed.

**Materials:**
14. **10mil Laser Teslin 8.5x11:**
    - Ideal for ID cards due to its ink absorption and bonding properties.
    - 10mil is the optimal thickness, but consider Artysian 10mil for improved adhesion and color.

15. **7mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Magnetic Stripe Laminate Sheets:**
    - Used for the backside of the ID card.
    - Available at www.brainstormidsupply.com.

16. **7mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Clear Laminate Sheet:**
    - Used for the front side of the ID card.
    - The 7mil laminate from www.brainstormidsupply.com works well with the recommended materials.

17. **Perl-Ex Pigment Powders:**
    - For our application, purchase 1 gram of Interference Gold and 2 grams of Sparkle Gold.
    - Available at http://practicingperfection.7p.com.

18. **Alps Finish Cartridges:**
    - Clear cartridges used to "lock in" the Pearl-Ex on the laminate when making holograms.
    - Available at http://practicingperfection.7p.com.

19. **Green Ultraviolet Pigment Powder:**
    - Used for creating the UV security feature.
    - Available at http://practicingperfection.7p.com.

20. **HP51645a Inkjet Cartridge:**
    - Filled with ultraviolet ink of your choice in color.

21. **Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol:**
    - Used for the airbrush hologram method.

22. **Transparent Base (Water or Acrylic Based):**
    - Used for the airbrush hologram method.

#### Hologram Creation
Creating the hologram is a critical and satisfying part of the ID making process. There are two main methods: the "Alps Printer Method" and the "Stamp Method." After extensive testing, the "Alps Printer Method" is highly recommended for its superior results and efficiency.

**Comparison of Hologram Methods:**

| **Alps Printer Method** | **Stamp Method** |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Expensive to operate     | Very inexpensive  |
| $400-$600 Printer + $15 per finishing cartridge | $25 Customized stamp at http://simonstamps.com |
| Less time-consuming (can make 8 holograms at once) | Very time-consuming (only one hologram at a time) |
| Near-perfect holograms every time | Easy to mess up and discard Teslin |
| Minimal mess to clean up | Sticky mess to clean up |
| Hard Ultraviolet Application | Easy Ultraviolet Application |

**Alps Printer Method:**
- **Required Equipment:**
  - Alps Printer
  - Perl-Ex Pigments (1 gram of Interference Gold and 2 grams of Sparkle Gold)
  - Chocolate Covered Fuzzy Banana
  - 7mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Clear Laminate Sheet
  - Alps Finish Cartridge
  - Photoshop Hologram Template
  - Optional safety equipment: Gloves, Respirator, and Eye Protection

**Setting Up the Alps Printer:**
1. Install the printer driver and print a test page.
2. Remove all color cartridges and install a single Alps Finish Cartridge.
3. Configure the printer to use the finish cartridge:
   - Control Panel -> Printers and Faxes -> Right Click on Alps Printer -> Properties

**Driver Note:**
- Alps Electronics no longer provides the driver for this printer on their website.
- Find the correct software/driver combination compatible with Windows XP.
- Use the Alps XP Driver for MD Models 1000, 1300, 1500, 2010, 2300, 4000, 5000, 5000p.
