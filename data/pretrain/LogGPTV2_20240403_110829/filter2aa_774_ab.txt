Getting this far has probably been a very interesting, time consuming, exciting, and frustrating experience.  It’s almost 
time to admire all your hard work.  Things really start to come together at this point but there is still quite a bit left to 
go as it is now time to laminate your batch.
We aren’t going to go into detail here concerning lamination as it is a pretty straight forward procedure.  Since 
most laminators are different, it will be up to you to ﬁgure out how to ﬁne tune the heat settings on your laminator.  A 
common problem that occurs during lamination is bubbling and deformation.  To prevent these things try lowering or 
raising the heat.  Another tip is to always place the items being laminated inside a protective pouch.  This will protect 
both the machine and your ﬁnal products.  You can create 
your own protective pouch by laminating two pieces of 
Teslin on one side only.  Then, when laminating, place the 
laminated Teslin sheets on the top and bottom of your 
batch, this will act as a protective pouch and will prevent 
deformation as well.
The ﬁnal step in the procedure is dye cutting.  This 
step should be done with much care, as it will make or 
break your newly laminated cards.  Never rush this part of 
the procedure, because if you mess this up, you will have to 
start all over.
Start off by cutting the laminated batch into a 
workable size.  In this example I cut two cards off of the 
main page, and cut them down so they ﬁt inside of the dye 
cutter.

Next, place the uncut cards into the dye cutter and position them so they are ready to cut.  This takes much practice, 
and there is no doubt you will mess up many times.  Don’t be to hard on yourself, it takes patience and patience to get 
it right.
Its now time for the last and ﬁnal step; writing to the magnetic stripe on the back of the newly cut membership card.

To verify the magnetic stripe works, put your magnetic encoder into write mode and write all the necessary 
information onto the card with your choice of software.  Then proceed to put the magnetic encoder into read mode 
and slide the card back through.

Now that we have a little background we can begin to get more technical.  If you have developed your own methods 
then please insert them when applicable.  However, this guide is a result of many thousands of hours of research time.  
Every combination of materials from every supplier available was tested regardless of the price.  Even inquiries were 
made to many large government contractors who manufacture many of the AAMVA regulated drivers licenses, 
regarding the types of materials used.   If you follow my guide without any shortcuts, your results will be stunning; 
guaranteed.
It’s about time we start talking about equipment.  You’re going to need a lot of equipment.  Making ID’s is about a 10 
step process.  After you do it about 150 times however, it starts to come naturally.  If you’re the artistic or obsessive 
type, you’re really going to like it.  For everyone else, you’re probably going to give up.  So if you think you are going 
to give up, then stop now.  If you’re not going to give up, then you will need a moderate amount of money.  Let’s start 
off with the printers:
Printer List
1)  Compatible Inkjet Printer (Epson Stylus R800 Photo Printer)
If you have done your research, you will know that any Epson printer with DuraBrite ink is usually 
recommended in the identiﬁcation card industry. This is because DuraBrite ink works especially well with Teslin. 
I highly recommend the Epson Stylus R800 photo printer.  After experimenting with most of Epson’s printer line, 
I have found this to always meet my expectations.  Other printers that are known to work well with Teslin are the 
Canon S800, Epson Stylus 800, Epson Stylus C82, Epson Stylus Photo 2200, Epson Stylus Photo 820, and HP 
950C. 
Keep in mind that when choosing a printer it is extremely important to choose one with pigment based ink for 
Teslin based ID applications.  Standard based ink, also known as dye based ink, has many characteristics that are 
not desirable for our application.  Here is a chart showing you the difference between pigment based inks and 
standard dye based inks:
PIGMENT INKS                                                  VS.                                    STANDARD DYE INKS
Particle based and does not dissolve completely in water.
Water based and does dissolve completely in water.
Very resistance to fading.
Fades easily.
Higher cost.
Lower cost.
Can print with laser Teslin, inkjet Teslin or Artysian synthetic printing sheets.
Prints only with inkjet Teslin and Artysian synthetic printing sheets.
2) Thermal Printer (Alps MD-1300, MD- 1500, or MD-5000) 
This printer can only be found on eBay, as they do not make them anymore.  It was introduced to the market 
about 15 years ago, and Alps Electronics took them off the market around 2004.  In 2007 they stopped supporting 
these printers forever, so you can no longer get them serviced.  A quote from www.alpsusa.com website says “As 
previously posted on March 31, 2007 Alps Electric (USA) Inc. no longer offers any support for the MD Series 
Printers models MD-2010/ 4000/ 2300/ 1000/ 1300/ 5000 respectively.”
 This machine will hook up to your desktop via an LPT printer port.  It will be used to print full page holograms.  
If you decide you want to make holograms using the “Stamp Method” (we will discuss that later) then you will 
not need this printer.  Expect to pay $400-$800 and don’t be surprised if you get a DOA.

3) HP Inkjet Printer
This printer is optional and can be used to print UV ink onto your ID. 
Must be compatible with HP51645a inkjet cartridges.
Misc. Equipment List
4) Laminator
Get a decent one.  Preferably one with a temperature control and metal gears.  It is essential that it can ﬁt at least 
8.5 inches across minimum.  So to be safe at least 10 inches across lamination surface.  Don’t be afraid to spend 
between $250 and $450 on a laminator, as it is a very important piece of equipment.
5) Dye Cutter
This tool is probably the coolest.  After your ID is laminated, this is the actual device that cuts it perfectly into ID 
size.  If this doesn’t make sense now, it will later.  Buy the dye cutter from www.brainstormidsupply.com .  You 
can buy the cheaper one for $390.  Buy it sooner than later, as it takes longer to ship and is often on back order.
6) Magnetic Stripe Encoder
Used to make the ID “scan.”
Stay away from EBay, as many are counterfeit.
Make sure it can write Hi-co and Low-co.  Also tracks 1, 2, and 3.
Be prepared to pay around $600, possibly more.
 7)  Black Light 
Almost all types of credit cards, security documents, and driver’s licenses use ultra violet ink for security.
8)  Airbrush (optional)
Advanced ID makers only.  Will be discussed later. 
 9) Chocolate Covered Fuzzy Banana
This isn’t a joke.  This is an even layer spreading tool that will be able to spread ﬁne particles out very evenly.  
This will be used when making the holograms. http://practicingperfection.7p.com 
 10) Scanner  
Any image scanner will do.

11) Signature Pad.
A peripheral that plugs into your USB port that allows you to use a pen in the place of a mouse.  Good for 
making signatures directly onscreen.  If you want to sign a piece of paper, then use a scanner and scan the 
signature in instead, this will work too.  
12) A copy of Adobe Photoshop
Or your favorite desktop photo editing suite. However, the guide will assume you are using CS2.
13) Computer
The computer must have some power.  It must be able to handle multiple print jobs to several different printers 
at once and anywhere from 4 to 20 large Photoshop ﬁles open at any time.
It must have an LPT port for the Alps printer.  Do not buy an USB to LPT connector + software package as the 
printer and printer software will reject this connection.  It has to be a real LPT port.
Unless you’ve got loads of horsepower, this shouldn’t be your regular computer.  Build a new one with a lot of 
memory.
Usable Materials
14) 10mil Laser Teslin 8.5x11
Teslin is a plastic material that goes in your printer like printer paper.  It absorbs ink well and bonds with the 
laminate glue making it a perfect material for identiﬁcation cards.  There are many different thicknesses and 
types of Teslin.  After experimenting with 5mil, 7mil, 8mil, 10mil, and 14mil, we have concluded that 10mil is the 
best size for our application.  After you become a little more experience, I recommend you switching over the 
Artysian 10mil material, as it has many beneﬁts such as improved adhesion qualities and more brilliant colors.  It 
is more money, however, so stick with the Teslin until you are ready. www.brainstormidsupply.com
15) 7mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Magnetic stripe Laminate Sheets
This 7mil thick laminate sheet is used on the backside of our ID card.  The black stripes you see are magnetic 
material that can be written on with a magnetic stripe encoder.  www.brainstormidsupply.com 
16) 7mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Clear Laminate Sheet
This is the piece of laminate that goes over the front side of the ID card.  We have experimented with 5mil, 5mil 
Matte, 5mil Lexan, 6mil Crystal, 7mil, 8m, 10mil nylon, 10mil polyester, 10mil clear, 10mil Matte, 10mil Lexan, 
14mil.  The 7mil from www.brainstormidsupply.com works with our combination of materials.

17) Perl-Ex Pigment Powders  
For our application buy 1 gram of Interference Gold and 2 grams of Sparkle Gold.
Otherwise you will need to ﬁgure out your own design.
http://practicingperfection.7p.com 
18) Alps Finish Cartridges
The Alps printer uses cartridges instead of ink.  The ﬁnishing cartridges are clear and will be used to “lock in” 
the Pearl-Ex on the laminate when making the holograms. http://practicingperfection.7p.com 
19) Green Ultraviolet Pigment powder
This is used to create the UV security feature that is present on most ID cards.
http://practicingperfection.7p.com
20) HP51645a Inkjet Cartridge
Filled with ultraviolet ink of your choice in color.
21) Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol
Used for the airbrush hologram method.
22) Transparent base (water or acrylic based).

Making the hologram is probably the most satisfying part of the whole operation.  The quality of the hologram can 
make or break the ID.  There are two main methods of hologram making; the ﬁrst method is the “Alps Printer 
Method” and the second method is the “Stamp Method.”  After experimenting with both methods I highly 
recommend using the “Alps Printer Method.”  Here is a table comparing the two main methods:
ALPS PRINTER METHOD                                 VS.                                              STAMP METHOD       
Expensive to operate!
Very inexpensive.
$400-$600 Printer + 15 Dollars per ﬁnishing cartridge
$25 Customized stamp at http://simonstamps.com 
Less time consuming You can make 8 holograms at one time.
Very time consuming.  Can only make a single hologram at one time. Tedious. 
Near perfect holograms every time and if you mess up you don’t have to 
throw away the Teslin, only the laminate.
Very easy to mess up and have to start all over.  If you mess up then the Teslin 
must be discarded. 
Not much mess to clean up.
Sticky mess to clean up.
Hard Ultraviolet Application
Easy Ultraviolet Application
Keep in mind there are also many other methods of producing holograms. Two more that I have found to work quite 
nicely are the:
1) “Silk Screen Method”
2) “Stencil and Air brush Method” – Not to be confused with the “Air brush Method” that allows you the print 
UV holograms on the Alps.  The air gun has two functions it can be used for, so keep that in mind.
Since these types of methods are much harder to perfect, I will not go into as much detail as I will with the other 
methods.  However it is important to point out that if you are able to perfect the “Silk Screen Method” or the “Stencil 
and Air gun Method, you may ﬁnd the results superior to those of the Alps or Stamp methods.

I would like to start off by going into more detail about the Alps printer, as it is a very interesting machine.  The Alps 
printer has many different uses such as micro dry printing, dye sublimation printing, photo printing, T-shirt transfers, 
decals and a lot more.  
Some the great aspects of the micro dry/dye sublimination printer are:
Brighter Colors
The ink transfers from the ink cartridge to the paper and is instantly dry.  
Water Proof and Smear Proof (these will be very important when printing our holograms)
Can print on a variety of different types of mediuma; Transparencies, Inkjet and Laser paper, decal paper, and 
laminates.
The only real problem with this printer is its total lack of speed.  This machine is incredibly slow.  Lucky for us, this 
won’t be a real issue.
First, we must get our Alps working correctly.  Start out by installing the printer driver and printing a test page.  Do 
not install via the control panel, as your printer will not install correctly.  You must install with the correct printer 
driver/software combination.  You will most likely have a lot of trouble with your Alps printer but don’t give up!  
Once you have the printer functioning, remove all the color cartridges from the printer and install a single Alps Finish 
Cartridge.  Now we are going to conﬁgure the printer to use the ﬁnish cartridge next time it prints.  Follow these 
steps: 
1) Control Panel -> Printers and Faxes -> Right Click on Alps Printer -> Go Down to Properties
Driver Note:
Alps Electronics no longer provides the driver for this printer on their website.  You 
must find the correct software/driver combination that is compatible with Windows 
XP.  If you try to install the original Alps software on your 2000, XP, or Vista machine 
it will not function correctly. There is a single Alps XP Driver floating around out there 
that works for MD Models 1000, 1300, 1500, 2010, 2300, 4000, 5000, 5000p.  This is 
most likely the one you will need.
