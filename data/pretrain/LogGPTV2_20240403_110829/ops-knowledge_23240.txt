User: In Docker, how to deploy and start the container's internal storage persistence solution
Assistant: There are many ways to deploy and start the container's internal storage persistence solution in Docker. The following are some common methods: 1. Data volume Using Docker's data volume function, the file system of the container and the file system of the host machine can be shared Map and share data between containers. Data volume is a lightweight persistence solution that can retain the data of the container, even if the container itself is deleted, the data will not be lost. The steps to use the data volume are as follows: (1) Create a data volume ``` docker volume create mydata ``` (2) Start the container and mount the data volume ``` docker run -d --name mycontainer -v mydata:/data myimage ``` (3) Access the data volume ``` docker exec -it mycontainer bash cd /data ``` 2. Bind mount Using the method of bind mount, you can directly map the files or directories inside the container to The specified directory of the host machine. This approach is more flexible than data volumes and supports mapping arbitrary directories to directories in the container. The steps to use bind mount are as follows: (1) Start the container and mount the local directory ``` docker run -d --name mycontainer -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container myimage ``` 3 . Persistent storage driver In Docker, you can use a third-party storage driver to implement the container's internal storage persistence. For example, distributed file systems such as GlusterFS, Ceph, or NFS can be used to implement highly available, elastic, and persistent storage solutions. The steps to use the persistent storage driver are as follows: (1) Install the persistent storage driver ``` docker plugin install <plugin_name> ``` (2) Start the container and use the storage driver ``` docker run -d --name mycontainer - -mount type=<plugin_name>,source=<plugin_name>:mydata,destination=/data myimage ``` The above are several common methods, according to different needs and scenarios, you can choose different methods to realize the internal storage of the container Persistence.
