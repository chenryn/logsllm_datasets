### Problem Description
For the native tray icons on windows, switching to dark mode will invert them.
This is very similar to the behavior on macOS (though on macOS it seems to
work for third party apps as well, including electron apps). As far as I can
tell, there isn't a clear way for an electron app to do a tray icon on windows
that automatically inverts when the light/dark mode setting switches.
I think part of the issue is that the app mode vs the shell mode is two
settings, and electron doesn't expose the shell mode: #19729
### Proposed Solution
Perhaps electron could provide a tray api update that lets you specify
alternative tray icons for light and dark mode on windows?
### Alternatives Considered
At the very least, an api that exposes which mode the shell is in, could be
nice. Not sure how you'd auto update the tray icon without polling, though. is
there a window message or some kind of event we could listen on for this?
