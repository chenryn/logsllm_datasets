### Abstract
Malicious web activities continue to pose a significant threat to online users. Despite the diversity of attack vectors and delivery channels, these activities are orchestrated through malicious web infrastructures, enabling criminals to collaborate and share resources. Identifying the critical nodes (linchpins) in these dark infrastructures is crucial for disrupting such activities.

In this study, we analyze nearly 4 million malicious URL paths collected from various attack channels to understand the topological relationships among hosts in malicious web infrastructures. Our findings reveal the existence of a set of topologically dedicated malicious hosts that play central roles in orchestrating these activities. These hosts are well-connected to other malicious entities and do not receive traffic from legitimate sources. Motivated by their distinct topological features, we develop a graph-based approach to detect these dedicated malicious hosts on a large scale. Our method, which uses a small set of known malicious hosts as seeds, achieves an expansion rate of over 12 times with a low false detection rate of 2%. Many of the detected hosts function as Traffic Distribution Systems (TDSes), which are long-lived and manage malicious traffic flows. Disrupting these dedicated hosts can have a more significant impact on the malicious web infrastructure than targeting short-lived entry points or exploit sites.

### 1. Introduction
Technological advancements often come with unintended consequences. The modern web, while fostering a thriving industry, also provides new opportunities for cybercriminals. Today, clicking a malicious URL can lead to interactions with a sophisticated underground syndicate, where different actors coordinate through malicious web infrastructures. These infrastructures facilitate the sharing of resources and orchestrate complex attacks, causing substantial financial damage annually.

#### 1.1 Background
Prior research has explored specific aspects of malicious web infrastructures, such as spam, black-hat SEO, and drive-by downloads. However, a comprehensive understanding of the overall topology and interconnections within these infrastructures is still lacking. This knowledge gap limits our ability to effectively counteract cybercrimes.

#### 1.2 Research Objective
Our study aims to provide a broader topological view of malicious web infrastructures. We focus on identifying topologically dedicated malicious hosts that play pivotal roles in orchestrating these activities. By understanding their characteristics and relationships, we can develop more effective strategies to disrupt these infrastructures.

### 2. Data Collection
We collected data from four primary sources:

- **Drive-by-download feed**: 1.5 million URLs from Microsoft.
- **Warningbird feed**: 300,000 suspicious URLs from Twitter spam.
- **Twitter feed**: 1.6 million URLs from trending topics.
- **Top-site feed**: 2 million URLs from Alexa's top 1 million websites.

These 5.5 million URLs were used to crawl and analyze redirection chains over a 7-month period.

### 3. Methodology
#### 3.1 Redirection Chain Crawling
We deployed 20 crawlers, each hosted on a separate Linux virtual machine, to explore the URL redirection paths. Each crawler, built as a Firefox add-on, tracks network requests, responses, and browser events to reconstruct the redirection paths. We handle various types of redirections, including HTTP status codes, Meta refresh tags, HTML, and JavaScript.

#### 3.2 Data Labeling
We labeled the crawled URLs, URL paths, and host paths as malicious or legitimate using a combination of existing tools, including Microsoft Forefront, an anti-virus scanner. URLs flagged as containing malicious content were labeled as malicious, and all paths passing through them were marked as suspicious.

### 4. Topological Analysis
Our analysis revealed a set of topologically dedicated malicious hosts with distinct features:
- Strong connections with each other, forming tight Host-IP Clusters (HICs).
- Extensive connections to other malicious entities, hosting over 70% of the malicious paths.
- No legitimate inputs, though they may redirect traffic to legitimate parties.

### 5. Detection Technique
We developed a graph-based approach to detect these dedicated malicious hosts. Starting with a small set of known malicious HICs as seeds, we propagate their scores across the web topology using the PageRank algorithm. Hosts highly endorsed by malicious entities but not by legitimate ones are identified as dedicated malicious HICs.

### 6. Evaluation
Our approach achieved a high detection rate, expanding the set of known malicious HICs by 12 times with a false detection rate of 2%. The detected TDSes were found to be long-lived (65 days vs. 2.5 hours for doorways and exploit sites) and continued to receive significant traffic even after being taken down.

### 7. Contributions
- **New Findings**: We provide the first comprehensive study on topologically dedicated malicious hosts, revealing their critical roles and topological features.
- **New Techniques**: We introduce a novel graph-based detection method that effectively identifies these hosts on a large scale.

### 8. Future Work
Future research could explore the dynamic evolution of these malicious infrastructures and develop more robust detection and disruption techniques.

### 9. Conclusion
Understanding the topological structure of malicious web infrastructures is essential for developing effective countermeasures. Our study provides valuable insights into the key nodes and offers a practical approach to detecting and disrupting these critical elements.
