What is an Interface?
“The point of interaction or communication 
between a computer and any other entity, 
such as a printer or human operator.”
source:  http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=interface
What is an Interface?
“The way that you accomplish tasks 
with a product and how it responds 
– that’s the interface.”
The Humane Interface by Jef Raskin, p2
Command Line vs. GUI
• Flexibility
• Time
• Ease of use
• Best for heavy users

Understanding Tasks
What tasks are 
your users trying 
to accomplish?

Who are 
your users?
Your Users may be Beginners…
“Ok I know i'm very slow, stupid too 
maybe.…I can't see a damn thing 
execpt the poster's e-mail address ….   
I am  new to computers and am trying to 
learn what I can so please be gentle.”

Advanced…
“From your questions, it seems you are 
over-simplifying just what a 
dissassembler can do for you. If you are 
not an experienced assembly language 
programmer then the dissassembled file 
will look like Greek”

• Fitt’s Law
• Invisible structures
• Mental Models
• Modes
image: http://www.uk-anime.net/fanart/large/loughead2.gif by Michelle Loughead
Design for Clarity
• Intuitive 
• Allow Exploration
• Always allow a way  out
• Consistency
image: http://www.atpm.com/6.07/images/filterit-confusing.gif
Navigation
• Beware too many features at top level
• Go where users expect

Color 
•
People need 
contrast
•
Less is more
•
Color 
Blindness
•
White or 
pale 
backgrounds 
are preferred
•
Use of colors 
to draw 
attention

Metaphor 
Metaphor use can map 
easily from people’s 
experience with other 
concepts
• Don’t force it
• Some are overdone…
– “The Town”
– “The Library”

Consistency 
Build on prior knowledge of other 
applications
•
Placement of controls
•
Keyboard shortcuts
•
Within program, environment and 
related tools
http://www.tiresias.org/controls/images/consistency.jpg
Feedback
• Timely feedback
• Busy indicator
• Progress indicator
• Visual and audible
http://www.dbdomain.com/dba14.htm
http://www.softlab-nsk.com/ddclipro/images/progress.gif
Testing
• Try it out on users, get feedback 
and fix
• You may be surprised
• Allow time to fix your project
• Value of Testing
• Iterative design
• How to conduct testing

Check Boxes
•
Dialog Boxes
•
Menus
•
Labels
•
Text Fields 
•
Toolbars
•
Forms
•
Splash Screens
•
Push Buttons List Boxes
•
Spinners
•
Sliders
•
and more…
image: MS Visual Basic 6.0
Radio Buttons
• 1 to Many Control
• Try to limit to 6 items
• Set Default
• Not a check box
• Never use just one
Check Boxes
• Used for single on/off settings
• Max 12 per group
• Don’t confuse with radio buttons
Dialog Boxes
• Modal (immediate task)
• Modeless (on going task)
• Beware too many levels
• Cancel doesn’t cancel

Menus
• Menu length
• Confusing menu items
• Keyboard shortcuts
You can find UltraEdit by IDM Computer Solutions at www.ultraedit.com
Menus
Dynamic interfaces are 
generally considered 
bad
Screen capture is from Microsoft PowerPoint 2000
Labels
• Keep text clear
• Place labels close to setting
• Consistent terminology, writing
• Avoid ambiguity
• Concepts must be distinct
image is from Microsoft Powerpoint 2000
Text Fields
• Defaults
• Make them large 
enough
• Highlighted 
current data
• Font size
• Alignment

Toolbars/Icons
• Consistency
• Test your images
• Sometimes text just works better
• Don’t Overdo It
image is from Microsoft Excel 2000
Forms 
and 
Overall 
Layout
Four Criteria1
– Dominant reading order
– Frequency of use
– Relationship to other controls
– User Expectations

Other Issues
– Resizable
– Background Images
– Logical Grouping
– Line things up
