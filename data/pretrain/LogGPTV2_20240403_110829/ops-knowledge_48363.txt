### Summary of the Log Chunk

**Time Frame:**
- The log entries span from 2015-08-25 05:00:15 to 2015-08-25 08:33:15.

**Components and Processes:**
- **QuorumCnxManager**: Responsible for managing connections to other nodes in the quorum.
- **FastLeaderElection**: Manages the leader election process, which includes sending and receiving notifications.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Failed Channel Openings:**
   - Multiple attempts to open a channel to two specific election addresses:
     - `/10.10.34.12:3888` (Node 2)
     - `/10.10.34.13:3888` (Node 3)
   - These attempts are logged as warnings and occur at various times throughout the log period. For example:
     - `2015-08-25 05:00:15`: Cannot open channel to Node 2
     - `2015-08-25 05:46:15`: Cannot open channel to Node 3
     - `2015-08-25 07:03:15`: Cannot open channel to Node 3
     - `2015-08-25 08:23:15`: Cannot open channel to Node 3

2. **Notification Timeouts:**
   - The FastLeaderElection component logs several notification timeouts, each with a duration of 60,000 milliseconds (1 minute). For example:
     - `2015-08-25 05:08:15`: Notification time out: 60000
     - `2015-08-25 05:09:15`: Notification time out: 60000
     - `2015-08-25 07:04:15`: Notification time out: 60000
     - `2015-08-25 08:29:15`: Notification time out: 60000
     - `2015-08-25 08:33:15`: Notification time out: 60000

**Conclusion:**
- The system is experiencing repeated failures in establishing connections to the specified election addresses, specifically Nodes 2 and 3.
- The FastLeaderElection process is timing out frequently, indicating potential issues with network connectivity or the availability of the nodes involved in the leader election process.
- This pattern of failed connections and timeouts suggests a need to investigate the network configuration, node availability, and any potential issues with the QuorumCnxManager and FastLeaderElection components.
