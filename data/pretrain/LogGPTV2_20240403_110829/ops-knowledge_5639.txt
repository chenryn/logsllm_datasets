Question: In a web application, how would you distinguish between a vertical privilege escalation and a horizontal privilege escalation event, and what are the potential implications of each?
"A": "Vertical escalation involves accessing resources of a more privileged account, like administrative privileges, which could potentially disrupt system integrity, while horizontal escalation involves accessing resources of a similarly configured account, which mainly affects user privacy.",
"B": "Horizontal escalation occurs when users can access system-level resources, which is a severe threat to application security, whereas vertical escalation is limited to accessing another regular user's data, posing less risk.",
"C": "Vertical escalation refers to gaining access to another user's session, while horizontal escalation means escalating one's own privileges without authentication, both leading to unauthorized data access.",
"D": "Horizontal escalation is about acquiring the privileges of a system administrator, an action that can compromise the entire application infrastructure, while vertical escalation is about accessing another user's information without significant system-wide implications."
