Could we get Swift's dot notation for enum values?
It is very cumbersome to import an enum declaration and having to write them
in function calls:
    // ABC.ts
    export const enum ABC {
      A, 
      B, 
      C,
    }
    export function testABC(abc: ABC) {
    }
    // test.ts
    import { ABC } from './ABC';
    import { testABC } from './ABC';
    // it is very cumbersome to import ABC and type ABC.
    testABC(ABC.A);
Swift introduced the most laziest way to write them. It would be good if TS
could support it also.
    // test.ts
    import { testABC } from './ABC';
    testABC(.A);
Here is an another example with a switch statement, where you don't need to
write `ABC` on every case:
    import { ABC } from './ABC';
    let abc: ABC;
    switch (abc) {
       case .A:
            break;
       case .B:
            break;
       case .C:
            break;
    }
