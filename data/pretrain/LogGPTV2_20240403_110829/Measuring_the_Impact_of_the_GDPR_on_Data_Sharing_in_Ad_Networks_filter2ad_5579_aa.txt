ABSTRACT
The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which
went into effect in May 2018, brought new rules for the process-
ing of personal data that affect many business models, including
online advertising. The regulation’s definition of personal data ap-
plies to every company that collects data from European Internet
users. This includes tracking services that, until then, argued that
they were collecting anonymous information and data protection
requirements would not apply to their businesses.
Previous studies have analyzed the impact of the GDPR on the
prevalence of online tracking, with mixed results. In this paper, we
go beyond the analysis of the number of third parties and focus
on the underlying information sharing networks between online
advertising companies in terms of client-side cookie syncing. Using
graph analysis, our measurement shows that the number of ID
syncing connections decreased by around 40 % around the time
the GDPR went into effect, but a long-term analysis shows a slight
rebound since then. While we can show a decrease in information
sharing between third parties, which is likely related to the legisla-
tion, the data also shows that the amount of tracking, as well as the
general structure of cooperation, was not affected. Consolidation in
the ecosystem led to a more centralized infrastructure that might
actually have negative effects on user privacy, as fewer companies
perform tracking on more sites.

1 INTRODUCTION
Advertising remains one of the main sources of income for many
websites, apps, and online services. Many business models rely on
ads and analytics services [44] to personalize their products and
to be able to offer them “for free”. To individually target website
visitors with ads, tracking services gather personal data, mostly
without users’ explicit consent [51]. Personalized ads are based on
data collected by ad companies about Internet users through various
mechanisms, mainly HTTP cookies [1, 16]. The gathered data is
often seen as an economic asset of a company [42]. But attackers
also perform malicious exfiltration of personal data [54]. As a result,
the imbalance of power between data processors (service providers)
and data subjects (users) increased in the last couple of years. Users
are often not aware of the collection, usage, or consequences of
the use of their data [11] and have only limited options when
trying to control it [41]. To address some of these problems, the
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went
into effect on May 25, 2018, introduced significant changes that
affect how personal data can be collected and shared. Compliance
with the GDPR rules is required for any company that offers services
in the European Union—no matter where their headquarters are
located [17].
In this work, we seek to provide insights into the effects of the
GDPR on the information sharing behavior between ad services.
Previous studies have described how cookie syncing is used to share
identifiers [1, 16], but there is a lack of knowledge about its extent,
the networks behind it, and its development over time. More specifi-
cally, we measure the relations of websites and third parties, as well
as links between third parties regarding ID syncing before and after
the GDPR took effect. Over the course of our experiment, we used
different browser profiles to visit more than 2.6 million websites
(∅ 221,000 in each crawl; 8,000 unique domains) over the course of
ten months to identify ID syncing between third parties embedded
in these websites. We use graph analysis techniques to measure
connections between third parties with respect to ID syncing and
demonstrate a decrease in the number of sharing communities and
the betweenness centrality, a measure for information flows.
Recent work has found that around the date of GDPR enforce-
ment in May 2018, the adoption of privacy policies and cookie
notices increased [15] and that at the same time the amount of
tracking [8] and cookie usage [12] decreased. However, others
found that the effects of the GDPR are not as significant in terms
of directly embedded third parties [43]. Our analysis shows that
changes can be observed if more complex coherences are taken
into account rather than counting third parties. We perform an
in-depth analysis to measure the effects of the new legislation on
the tracking ecosystem as we investigate links between companies
and go beyond the measurements that focus on embedded third
parties and cookies directly set by websites. We show that while
the amount of data collected about Internet users may not have
changed since May 2018, the number of online advertising compa-
nies that share information has decreased. At the same time, those
that still share information have not limited their efforts, instead,
some companies might benefit from an ongoing centralization.
To summarize, our study makes the following contributions:
• We measure changes regarding the use of third-party ser-
vices by websites shortly before and the months after the
GDPR enforcement and show the shift of relations between
these third parties in terms of ID syncing. Based on twelve
measurements over a period of ten months, starting before
the GDPR’s enforcement date, we show that the amount of
links between companies is reduced by over 40 %.
• We employ methods of graph analysis to construct an undi-
rected graph that describes the relations between third par-
ties. Different measures of ID sharing communities show
that the general structure of relations is not affected.
• Finally, we analyze the topology how third parties are con-
nected and show that third parties are often arranged in
star-like topologies with one central node that is sometimes
linked to hundreds of outer nodes.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: We first
give an overview of online tracking, cookie syncing, and the GDPR
(Section 2) and then discuss how our measurements compare to
related work (Section. 3). Afterwards, we describe our measure-
ment framework using OpenWPM (Section 4). Our results section
(Section. 5) describes the changes in the advertising ecosystem we
observed and offers some explanations for them (Section 6). We
discuss potential limitations of our analysis and conclude with a
summary of our results (Section 6).
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide some background information necessary
to study the effects of legislation on information sharing between
online advertising companies. We describe the overall advertising
ecosystem, technical details of cookie syncing, and the importance
of the GDPR for this socio-technical system.
2.1 Advertising Economy
Displaying ads is the most common way to fund online services.
in 2017, the online advertising industry generated total revenues
of $88.0 billion [26] in the US and e 41.8 billion in the European
Union [25]. The ecosystem behind this is complex and consists in a
nutshell of three basic entities described in the following [59].
On the one end, there are publishers and website owners that
use supply-side platforms (SSP) to sell ad space on websites. On the
other end, the demand-side platform (DSP) is used by marketing
companies to organize advertising campaigns, across a range of
publishers. To do so, they do not necessarily have to select a specific
publisher they want to work with but can define target users based
on different criteria (e. g., geolocation, categories of websites vis-
ited, or personal preferences). A data management platform (DMP)
captures and evaluates user data to organize and optimize digital ad
campaigns. They can be used to merge data sets and user informa-
tion from different sources to automate campaigns on DSPs. To do
so, a DMP often collects IDs of different systems and merges data
with those from other sources to target ad campaigns to a specific
audience based on high-level information like interest profiles [14].
Therefore, user tracking and profiling are critical parts of website
and mobile application business models alike [1, 16, 44]. Profiles
containing information necessary to target advertisements like
interests or lists of previous purchases are often based on the users’
clickstream (a list of websites a user has visited) to enable targeted
advertising [7]. A unique digital identifier is assigned to each user,
either by a server or computed based on properties of the user’s
device (device fingerprinting [16]). The most prevalent way to store
such digital identifiers on a user’s device are HTTP cookies.
2.2 Cookie Syncing
A HTTP cookie is a piece of textual data, strictly limited in size,
that can be set by a website to store data locally on a client. In
theory, cookies contain simple name=value pairs but in practice,
they often serve as a reference (i. e., a user ID) and combine informa-
tion through various means [21]. Cookies are intended to maintain
a state between different HTTP sessions, e. g., to remember user
preferences, to keep items stored in the shopping cart, or to log
that a user has previously authenticated with the server. Storing a
unique user identifier in a cookie allows a server to identify a user
revisiting a website. It is also common that additional information
exceeding the allowed size for cookies is stored on the server related
to that same ID (e. g., inferred interest segments). If the website
originally opened by a user sets a cookie, it is called a first-party
cookie (A in Figure 1). A cookie is called a third-party cookie if the
visited website embeds an object from another domain and this
third party sets a cookie (B1 and B2 in Figure 1). For online advertis-
ing, this could be profile information like inferred interest segments
or geolocation. A server can only access a cookie under the domain
that set it, meaning that different third parties cannot access each
other’s cookies. This prohibits data leakage or cross-domain track-
ing of different third parties by merely accessing the cookies (via
the Same-Origin Policy).
Cookie syncing is a process to bypass the Same-Origin Policy
by sharing the unique identifier of a user between two third par-
ties (C in Figure 1). Cookie syncing is mostly a two-step process:
(C1) a script from a third-party (bar.org) is loaded into a website
(example.org). (C2) The request that loads the script is then redi-
rected or the script itself issues a new request to the syncing partner
online tracking are considered personal data and would need ex-
plicit consent [13], but studies on Web tracking showed that online
advertisers did not follow these recommendations, for example
by ignoring the Do-Not-Track signal [48]. It was expected that
the GDPR led to changes and influenced the online advertisement
ecosystem since it extended its legal reach to companies that con-
duct business with the EU regardless of where their headquarters
are located. Compared to previous legislation, it also allows data
protection authorities to fine companies much higher than before
with up to 4 % of their global annual revenue. In January 2019, the
French data protection authority (CNIL) fined Google for 50 million
Euros for not validly obtaining consent [10].
3 RELATED WORK
Multiple research groups have studied how websites and third-party
tracking changed around the enforcement date of the GDPR in May
2018. In this section, we provide an overview of the related work
on GDPR measurements and similar research in this area.
3.1 GDPR Measurements
An overview of privacy-related measurement studies, with a focus
on the GDPR, is given in Table 1. Different studies measured similar
topics with mixed results [8, 43]. This, alongside our results, high-
lights that effects of complex legislation (i. e., the GDPR) are not
necessarily measurable in all parts of a complex ecosystem such
as online advertising or online tracking. Our work differs from the
related work as we do an in-depth analysis of the ecosystem (i. e.,
connections of third parties) and do not limit our measurements to
the embedded third parties.
Most recent works measured the effect of the GDPR regarding
cookie usage and embedded third parties. Dabrowski et al. measure
the effects of cookies set based on the location of a user and find
that around 50 % more cookies are being set if the users come
from outside the EU [12]. In contrast, Sørensen et al. found that the
number of third parties slightly declined since the GDPR went into
effect (which is in line with our findings) but they conclude that
the GDPR is not necessarily responsible for that effect [43].
Regarding GDPR rights, Urban et al. have shown that performing
subject access requests (SARs) can be a tedious and often unsuc-
cessful process [53] while the data received by SARs is often not
intuitive and not helpful [52].
3.2 Online Privacy Measurements
Most previous work analyzes online privacy through measurements,
which have all been conducted prior to the GDPR. For example,
Gonzales et al. presented a large-scale study on the use of HTTP
cookies [21]. The authors analyzed more than 5.6 billion HTTP
requests over a period of 2.5 months. They show that, in prac-
tice, cookies are much more sophisticated than simple name=value
pairs and present an algorithm capable of inferring the format of a
cookie with high recall and precision rates. In 2016, Englehardt and
Narayanan published their work on measuring online tracking [16].
They introduce the open-source measurement tool OpenWPM, which
they used to crawl and analyze the top one million websites on
the Internet. They analyzed cookie-based and fingerprint-based
tracking along with 13 other types of measurements. Papadopoulos
Figure 1: Different types of cookies: (A) a first-party cookie—
directly set by the visited website, (B) a third-party cookie—

chronized cookie—shared between two parties.
(sync.org). This redirected request contains the ID bar.org as-
signed to the user (e. g., sync.org?bar_user_id=XYZ). After this
ID syncing sync.org knows, via the HTTP referrer header or
additional information added to the request, that the user with
bar.org’s ID visited example.org (C3). If sync.org already has a
cookie (e. g., from a previous visit to another website) on the client, it
can map bar.org’s user ID with its own (C4). This allows sync.org
and bar.org to share data about the user over another channel
(C5). This mechanism also allows a tracking company (sync.org)
to track users on a large variety of websites even if these websites
do not directly embed a tracker by that company but by its partners.
While this is considered an undesirable privacy intrusive behav-
ior by some, it is in practice a fundamental part of the online ad
economy to perform Real-Time Bidding (RTB) [36]. In RTB impres-
sions and online ad space are sold in real-time on automated online
marketplaces whenever a website is loaded in a browser.
2.3 Legal background
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR or Regulation 2016/
679) [17] is a regulatory instrument by the European Union (EU) to
harmonize data protection laws between its member states. After
a transition period of two years, it was put into effect on May 25,
2018. The GDPR specifies under which circumstances personal data
may be processed, lists rights of data subjects, and obligations for
those processing personal data of EU citizens. It is therefore impor-
tant for all companies offering services which collect and process
personal data in Europe. The GDPR was expected to have a strong
impact on the online advertising ecosystem as it provides a broader
understanding of what is considered to be personal data [37]. Until
before the GDPR, many advertising companies claimed (and still
claim) that they only process anonymized data because the profiles
they use for targeted advertising mostly do not contain personal
identifiers like names or home addresses. In contrast, GDPR consid-
ers this pseudonymous data as it still describes one single person
that is re-identifiable with additional information.
The European Data Protection Authorities (Article 29 Working
Group) had already decided in 2010 that profiles created through
