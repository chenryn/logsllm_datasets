**ATT&CK ID:** T1625.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Runtime API Hijacking

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way an operating system runs applications. This technique involves altering the normal execution flow of system runtime APIs, allowing the adversary to inject and execute malicious code. 

This method can be used for persistence, as the hijacked execution flow may reoccur at later points in time, ensuring that the malicious payload continues to run even after system reboots or other interruptions.
