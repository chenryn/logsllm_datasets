Figure 7: These graphs show the results of an experiment in which two FPGAs had their ambient temperature
vary between 25(cid:14)C and 50(cid:14)C. The bottom plots show the measurement value versus time (in half-second
sampling intervals). Note that the two FPGAs did not undergo the same temperature changes at the same
time. The top plots are histograms of the respective plots on the bottom.

Figure 9: Compensated Delay versus Input Challenges for the Demultiplexer circuit on two di(cid:11)erent FPGAs:
The large scale structure is identical, and is due to di(cid:11)erences in routing of paths on a given circuit. The
di(cid:11)erence between the FPGA appears at a much smaller scale, and can be seen as a di(cid:11)erence in texture
between the two plots.
159One approach that we are considering, is to use a known
pseudo-random function (PRF), used out of its normal op-
erating conditions as the PUF circuit. In that case, it might
be possible to relate the security of the PUF to the security
of the PRF.
It would also be good to (cid:12)nd better ways of measuring
physical characteristics of the chip. Measuring delays di-
rectly instead of using self-oscillating circuits would allow
the silicon PUF to operate much faster, allowing it to be
used in protocols that require large numbers of uses.
Im-
proved measurement techniques might also make it possible
to use circuits with glitches to reliably extract information
about the chip. These circuits would be harder to simulate,
making the adversary’s problem harder. Moreover, in the
case of Controlled PUFs, it is conceivable that di(cid:11)erential
power analysis techniques could be used on self-oscillating
circuits to read challenges o(cid:11) the PUF against its will. The
use of direct delay measurement should greatly reduce the
signature of the delay measurement on the IC’s power sup-
ply.
Another great improvement would be to (cid:12)nd a way to use
any su(cid:14)ciently complex circuit, and suitably instrumented
circuit as a SPUF. This would make the cost of adding PUF
support to a circuit very low, and would guarantee that the
PUF is inseparable from the circuit that it is supposed to
accompany. This is particularly important in the case of
controlled PUFs.
Finally, a detailed study of the physical attacks that the
adversary can carry out is necessary. In particular it is im-
portant to know if probing the PUF circuitry using advanced
non-invasive techniques can help build a simulation model of
the PUF, and if so the physical barriers that can be placed
against such probing must be considered.
8. CONCLUSION
We have described the notion of a Physical Random Func-
tion (PUF) and shown that a silicon PUF can be created.
The obvious application of a silicon PUF is authentica-
tion. Authentication has to be carried out reliably, mini-
mizing the likelihood of false positives or false negatives. In
order to perform reliable authentication, we proposed a cir-
cuit architecture for a PUF where delays are measured rel-
ative to other delays. This lends robustness to our scheme,
and preliminary experiments indicate that authentication
can be carried out reliably under signi(cid:12)cant variations in
environmental conditions. To be robust against more signif-
icant environmental variations, careful circuit and package
design is required. Fortunately, the VLSI design community
is already addressing these problems in the realm of high-
performance circuit design.
In addition, a manufacturing
process that produces high variations in device delays will
result in higher signal-to-noise ratios and enable improved
reliability.
The most plausible attack on a PUF is the model-building
attack, where an adversary has access to the packaged IC
containing the PUF, and can apply arbitrary challenges and
monitor the resulting response. We have presented a prelim-
inary analysis of this problem and our experiments indicate
model-building is hard due to the precision requirements,
but more work needs to be done in both analysis and exper-
imentation.
While many problems remain to make PUFs useful and
practical, we believe that this is a very promising low cost
approach to improving the physical security of devices, espe-
cially when it is coupled with the ideas on controlled PUFs
from [10].
