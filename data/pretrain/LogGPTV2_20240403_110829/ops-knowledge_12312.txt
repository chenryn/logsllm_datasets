The provided system log contains 20 lines, each with a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and log content. Here is a step-by-step summary of the key events and issues:

1. **Address Change Detection (HDFS Lease Renewal)**
   - Multiple WARN logs indicate that the address for the HDFS lease renewal has changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`. This change is detected at several timestamps: 18:09:40, 18:09:41, 18:09:42, 18:09:43, 18:09:44, 18:09:45.
   
2. **Lease Renewal Failure**
   - The system fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times. The failure durations are 283 seconds, 284 seconds, 285 seconds, 286 seconds, and 287 seconds. The system indicates it will retry shortly after each failure.

3. **Address Change Detection (RM Server)**
   - Similar to the HDFS lease renewal, the system also detects an address change for the RM server from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`. This change is detected at several timestamps: 18:09:41, 18:09:43, 18:09:45.

4. **Connection Retry to RM Server**
   - The system attempts to connect to the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030` and retries the connection. The retry policy is `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`. This is logged at 18:09:42 and 18:09:44.

5. **Error in Contacting RM Server**
   - The system logs an ERROR indicating a failure in contacting the RM server. This error is logged at 18:09:42 and 18:09:44.

**Summary:**
- The system is experiencing repeated address changes for both the HDFS lease renewal and the RM server.
- There are multiple failures in renewing the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]`, with the system indicating it will retry.
- The system is attempting to connect to the RM server and is using a retry policy, but it is encountering errors in establishing the connection.
- These issues suggest potential network or configuration problems that need to be addressed to ensure stable operation.
