## Author: Cat Okita, 2003

### Overview of Reputation Systems
**Definition:**
A reputation system is a mechanism that collects, aggregates, and distributes information about the past behavior or performance of entities. Examples include LiveJournal, Friendster, eBay, Advogato, and Slashcode.

**Relevance:**
- **Establishing Trust:** Helps users determine the reliability and trustworthiness of other entities.
- **Performance Metrics:** Provides data to evaluate the performance of individuals or organizations.
- **Meme Propagation:** Facilitates the spread of ideas and trends.
- **Spam Filtering:** Aids in identifying and filtering out unwanted or malicious content.

### Challenges
- **Authentication:** Ensuring the identity of the entities involved.
- **Trust:** Building and maintaining trust within the system.
- **Non-repudiation:** Preventing entities from denying their actions.

### Design Considerations
- **Efficiency:** Fast and resource-efficient operation.
- **Security:** Robust security measures to prevent corruption of information and impersonation.
- **Portability:** Easy to use from any location.
- **Usability:** Simple to use and extend.
- **Decentralization:** Independent of centralized servers.

### Potential Attacks
- **Information Poisoning:** Flooding the system with false information.
- **Trojans:** Malware that can compromise the system.
- **Identity Theft:** Unauthorized use of an entity's identity.
- **Impersonation:** Falsely representing oneself as another entity.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting the system's availability.

### Implementation
- **Peer-to-peer Architecture:** Decentralized network where nodes communicate directly.
  - **Collector Mode:** Nodes can also act as collectors, aggregating and disseminating information.
- **Reputation Mode:** 
  - **Overall Valuation:** Evaluates the overall reputation of an entity, both personal and general.
  - **Template-based Valuation:** Specific templates for detailed evaluation.
- **Gossip Mode:** Spreads information about other entities in the network.

### Practical Applications
- **Mailer Selection:** Choosing a mailer based on its stability, speed, and security.
- **Mailing List Poster Evaluation:** Assessing whether a poster is credible, an expert, or unknown.

### Configuration
- **Text-based Configuration:** Uses text files for configuration.
  - **Templates:** Customizable templates for detailed settings.
- **Public Key Requirement:** Requires the use of public key cryptography for secure communication.

### Future Plans
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Development of a more user-friendly interface.
- **Cross-Platform Portability:** Improved compatibility across different platforms.
- **Statistical Reporting:** Enhanced statistical analysis and reporting features.
- **Group Keys:** Implementation of group keys for better management.
- **Trigger Automation:** Automated triggers for specific events or conditions.
