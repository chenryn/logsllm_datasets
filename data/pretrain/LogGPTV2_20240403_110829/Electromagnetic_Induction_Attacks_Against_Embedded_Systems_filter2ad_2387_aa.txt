ABSTRACT
Embedded and cyber-physical systems are critically dependent on
the integrity of input and output signals for proper operation. Input
signals acquired from sensors are assumed to correspond to the
phenomenon the system is monitoring and responding to. Similarly,
when such systems issue an actuation signal it is expected that the
mechanism being controlled will respond in a predictable manner.
Recent work has shown that sensors can be manipulated through
the use of intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). In this
work, we demonstrate that both input and output signals, analog
and digital, can be remotely manipulated via the physical layer—
thus bypassing traditional integrity mechanisms.
Through the use of specially crafted IEMI it is shown that the
physical layer signaling used for sensor input to, and digital com-
munications between, embedded systems may be undermined to
an attacker’s advantage. Three attack scenarios are analyzed and
their efficacy demonstrated. In the first scenario the analog sensing
channel is manipulated to produce arbitrary sensor readings, while
in the second it is shown that an attacker may induce bit flips in
serial communications. Finally, a commonly used actuation signal
is shown to be vulnerable to IEMI. The attacks are effective over
appreciable distances and at low power.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sensors and actuators are critical components in embedded and
cyber-physical systems in that they allow these systems to know
about and influence the analog world. For example, in cars they are
essential components of safety systems such as anti-lock brakes, ve-
hicle detection for collision avoidance, and automatic cruise control.
Such systems are designed to implicitly trust the sensing/actuation
mechanism per se and, at best, attempt to ensure that digitized read-
ings are not manipulated; the possibility that a malicious-minded in-
dividual could attack the system by altering what is sensed/actuated
is rarely considered. This makes them vulnerable to attacks that
target the non-digitized output/input directly.
Sensing and actuation systems produce or rely on voltages and
currents, often on the order of a few volts/mili-amperes, to com-
municate information on the phenomenon being sensed or control
actuators [15]. Thus, one way that the sensor output/actuator in-
put can be corrupted directly is by electromagnetic interference
(EMI). This is possible because EMI can induce a voltage or cur-
rent that is then digitized/acted on by the system. Intentionally
altering a measurement/output through EMI is known as inten-
tional electromagnetic interference (IEMI). IEMI attacks have been
shown to be capable of bypassing common security mechanisms,
potentially giving an attacker the ability to control the sensor read-
ings [19]. This work focuses on understanding the susceptibility
of microcontrollers to IEMI attacks, specifically their analog in-
put and digital input/output ports. By modifying the input/output
read/produced by the system one is able to compromise a wide array
of sensors/actuators, regardless of the specific sensing/actuation
method. Unfortunately, while the robustness of sensor output (i.e.,
after digitization) from a systems perspective has been researched
extensively, work examining the vulnerability of sensor measure-
ments/actuation commands to IEMI attacks is scarce [35].
First, by examining a simple circuit model of an IEMI attack
this work hopes to identify potentially important circuit elements.
Identifying these elements will help increase the understanding
of what makes a system vulnerable to IEMI attacks. Second, the
possibility of manipulating these elements will then be evaluated
by conducting IEMI attacks against a system and systematically
varying the attack configuration. This will allow for a better under-
standing of what attack strategies have the largest effects. Third,

to evaluate the vulnerability of analog/digital inputs and digital
outputs operating in the range of volts.
1.1 Contributions
We improve upon existing work in the realm of IEMI by demonstrat-
ing that it is possible to affect the DC, or mean, voltage outputted
by a sensor/actuation system (as seen by the sensing/controlled
system) using low-power IEMI—thereby allowing for arbitrary false-
data injection against analog and digital systems (previous work
has been limited to inducing time varying signals, except in the
case of magnetic sensors). We also offer a physical theory of attack,
grounded in electromagnetic theory, that allows us to examine
ways to increase the efficacy of the attack and explains prior results
reported in the literature, e.g., [19]. Our theory of attack explains
how attack waveforms can be constructed to allow an attacker to
induce arbitrary voltage readings, within system parameters, at the
digitization input. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to demonstrate a physical layer attack against an actuation
signal (i.e., false actuation injection).
1.2 Related work
A substantial body of work exists on the effects of high power EMI
or high power IEMI (HPIEMI) [5, 25, 27]. Much of the research on
the use of HPIEMI focuses on the destruction or disruption of elec-
tric systems instead of influencing a measurement. The most closely
related work we found was [5], wherein a summary was given of
work that was done by various military groups using HPIEMI to
disrupt or destroy electronic systems. Using high power anten-
nas and amplifiers multiple electrical systems were successfully
destroyed or disrupted. One observation that was made was that
each attack was very frequency and angle dependent. The authors
concluded that this method can be used up to a kilometer away but
requires careful pre-analysis of the system. In contrast, our work
presents attacks of comparatively low power that require only min-
imal reconnaissance of the target (namely, being in possession of a
duplicate device so as to characterize its response to attacks).
Only a few papers that examined the use of IEMI to attack sensor
output or readings directly were found [9, 11, 12, 19, 34, 44]. The
earliest work [11] examined the effects of IEMI on sensor networks
by looking at a particular sensor network node. They observe that
because of the size of the node it shouldn’t be susceptible to IEMI
at low frequencies but rather at high frequencies in the GHz range.
The lack of susceptibility at low frequencies was verified by using
standard electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing signals with
amplification and a BiLog antenna from 80–1000 MHz with field
strengths of 10–20 V/m. No IEMI effects were observed for these
tests. A number of methods for mitigating the effects of IEMI on
sensor networks were proposed. Our work demonstrates that even
electrically small circuits are vulnerable to IEMI in this frequency
range if the proper coupling mechanism is used; i.e., using near-
field coupling as the attacking field instead of far-field coupling as
has been widely studied.
An IEMI attack against an anti-lock braking system (ABS) was
demonstrated in [34]. The attack is carried out by generating a
magnetic field stronger than the one created by the movement of a
ferrimagnetic toothed gear. The manipulation vector in that case
was based on Ampère’s law (i.e., the creation of magnetic fields)
and is only effective against magnetic field sensors. Our attack
mechanism is applicable to a much wider range of sensors (viz. those
that output voltages/currents) as it is based on electromagnetic
induction brought about by Faraday’s law.
In [19] two types of IEMI attacks, which were referred to as
baseband or modulated IEMI attacks, were examined. Both attacks
assume that a filter is placed in between the sensor and the mi-
crocontroller and that they are attacking analog sensors operating
on the order of millivolts. Baseband attacks take place in the same
frequency range as the signals being generated and therefore are
nearly impossible to filter out because doing so would filter out le-
gitimate signals. Modulated attacks take place at a higher frequency
and use some part of the circuit to down-modulate their attack into
the baseband. It appears that near-field electric coupling was em-
ployed in this work. As such, a saline solution used as part of the
experiment was shown to attenuate the field effectively enough to
prevent the attack. We will focus primarily on magnetic near-field
coupling as it is difficult to shield against [24, 26, 43]. In fact, due to
its low permeability, the saline solution that thwarted the baseband
attack in [19] would be electrically transparent to our attack signal,
thus allowing for successful induction of the attack signal (e.g., [17]
indicates significant improvements in transmitting power through
human tissue using the near field even in the GHz range).
2 THREAT AND ATTACK MODELS,
COUNTERMEASURES
Embedded systems are equipped with digital interfaces (e.g., UART,
SPI, I2C [3]) to communicate with sensors/actuators and analog-to-
digital converters (ADC) to measure the output of sensors (typically
a voltage proportional to the phenomenon being measured). We
hypothesize that it is possible to manipulate these channels via near-
field coupling. Non-conducted sources of EMI are due to near-field
coupling or far-field radiation [28]. In what follows, we provide an
analysis of input/output interfaces that implies that it is possible to
leverage the printed circuit board (PCB), traces of the PCB, and the
pins of embedded devices to perform inductive coupling [8]. Due
to parasitic resistance, inductance, and capacitance of the PCB they
are laid out on, the traces which they are attached to, and the pin
circuitry itself, these interfaces will exhibit frequency-dependent
susceptibility to IEMI (i.e., they will react to interference at some
frequencies more strongly than others) [7, 41].
2.1 Threat model and assumptions
A single attacker attempting to manipulate a victim system con-
sisting of either a single sensor connected to an associated ADC or
digital input, or a digital interface connected to an actuator is as-
sumed. The attacker is able to gain physical proximity to the victim
circuit but can only interact with it through IEMI (Fig. 1a). The ideal
range for these types of attacks is dependent on the frequency and
power of the attack but is generally considered to be less than 5 m.
Because of limitations in our setup (i.e., power and antenna design),
we limit the attack range to 1 m, which represents a substantial
increase over [19, 34].

to flow through an antenna, which in turn creates a time-varying magnetic field H that induces a voltage v(t) at the receiver.
(c) Circuit model for the EM-based attack.
The goal of the attacker is to either control the sensor output
that the victim perceives (i.e., a false-data injection attack [FDI])
or manipulate the signal used to control an actuator (i.e., a false-
actuation injection attack [FAI]). To do so the attacker is equipped
with a power supply, RF amplifier, signal generator, etc. In the
case of FDI an analog or digital sensor is assumed to be outputting
a voltage, Vact , that corresponds to the phenomenon of interest,
while for FAI the embedded system is generating a voltage, again
denoted by Vact , that controls an actuator. In each case the attacker
uses the aforementioned equipment to generate an attack signal
that couples to the targeted system and induces a voltage, Vatk. The
system/actuator perceives the linear combination of the actual and
attack voltages, Vm = Vact + Vatk. (The significance of the integral
in Fig. 1a will be explained below.) It is important to note that
the attack can be improved by assuming an attacker with a more
powerful transmitter (e.g., higher gain antenna and/or amplifier).
2.2 Analytical model of attack
To simplify our analysis, we begin by assuming that the time-
varying current generated by the transmitter, i(t), is carried by
an infinitely long wire situated along the z-axis at a distance d from
the receiver, which is itself oriented along the x and z axises (Figure
1b). Positive current is seen as traveling in the +z direction and
negative current in the −z direction. Assuming magnetoquasistatic
conditions (i.e., the wavelength of the field is much greater than
the physical dimensions of the system it is affecting), the resulting
magnetic field, H, produced by the current is given by
H = ˆy
