Abstract
A service provider is interested in precise service cost calculations. Reliable cost
information is required for sound economic decisions and provides valuable input for human
resource management. But, without accounting for customer involvement, service costing is not
accurate. Existing costing methods like Activity-Based Costing (ABC) have paid too less
attention on customer introduced uncertainty. To overcome this problem and to increase
reliability we measure a customer’s individuality e.g. (experience, company size or speed of
internet connection) and integrate it into cost accounting. We have developed a three layered
approach based on customer factors, customer factor classes and Time-Driven Activity-Based
Costing (TDABC) to compute a customer’s influence on service costs. Our approach is used to
compute customer factors to forecast service activity time. In this paper we describe our
approach and demonstrate that it increases accuracy of service costing. The approach was
evaluated using data from an international software provider.

INTRODUCTION
Services have contributed significantly to the economic growth in the last years. This
brings new challenges for service providers in B2B and B2C service scenarios. In this context,
we focus on the mandatory customer involvement in the process of service co-creation. A service
provider is forced to integrate a service customer into service provision with positive or negative
consequences on service costs. During co-creation both partners participate in a service system
and invest resources e.g. knowledge, human resources or infrastructure capabilities (Spohrer,
Maglio, Bailey, & Gruhl, 2007).
Customer involvement requires a service provider to extend the process view to the
customer domain to consider the impact of customer factors, because they define the necessary
resources for co-creation. Customer factors are all the tangible and intangible artifacts which
influence co-creation e.g. information, experience, technical capabilities or commitment.
Since “the customer is a coproducer of service” (Vargo & Lusch, 2004), the concept of
Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic also demands to include customer factors into investigations
concerning qualitative and quantitative measurements. In S-D Logic the most important
resources are knowledge and competencies of the provider and customer.
We motivate our approach based on the fact that a company needs methods to achieve
pre-defined goals of the corporate strategy (Morris & Ashley, 2004). This includes solid
information to decide about leadership based on costs or differentiation. We treat costs and the
associated corporate strategy of cost leadership as a quantitative measurement and differentiation
as qualitative measurement. With cost leadership a company tries to gain higher margins
compared to competitors by lowering production and distribution costs (Reimann, Schilke, &
Thomas, 2010). With solid information about the required level of customer involvement, cost
accounting of a service provider is more accurate. This enables the service provider to include a
customer’s individuality into economic decisions, e.g. market price considerations.
Our research target is to increase the accuracy of service cost calculations by including a
customer’s individuality into cost accounting. A reason for imprecise service cost calculations is
the uncertainty induced by customers on the process of co-creation. In our study, we have
analyzed services from an international software provider. We have selected the service
requirements engineering which is part of complex software integration projects. Such projects
have a duration that ranges 3 to 24 months and a budget up to 2 million Euros. The complexity
of requirements engineering depends on what the customer “wants” and the target is to prepare a
requirements description document which can be implemented within the forecasted time.
Project managers and software developers confirm that it is difficult to estimate the activity time
and associated costs for this service. The current practice is to implicitly consider different
customer factors, like experience, contact persons or company size without a systematic process.
This paper is organized as follows. In section two we describe the related work associated
to service co-creation. Section three is used for our customer factor approach. Section four
describes our evaluation process based on the service scenario requirements engineering. Finally,
we draw our conclusions and give an outlook to our on-going research activities.
RELATED WORK
In this section we focus on the different roles a customer can assume during the service
co-creation with a provider. Furthermore, we want to discuss production factors for a successful
service co-creation as well as quantitative effects – the service costs.

From a provider’s perspective, customers can contribute to the service creation in
different roles. As discussed in scientific papers about customer integration (e.g. (Bitner,
Faranda, Hubbert, & Zeithaml, 1997) and (Srivastava, Shervani, & Fahey, 1999)), it depends on
the customer’s qualification and the internal processes of the provider, how well the relationship
succeeds. In (Straub, Kohler, Hottum, Arrass, & Welter, 2013) several different customer
functions based on the work of (Büttgen, 2009), (Schneider & Bowen, 1995), (Lengnick-Hall,
1996), (Bettencourt, 1997), (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2000), (Wind & Rangaswamy, 2001),
(Chervonnaya, 2003), (Graf, 2007), such as ‘co-designer’, ‘service-specifier’, ‘co-marketer’,
‘quality-controller’, or ‘co-producer’, have been identified. For a direct integration of the
customer into the provision of a service, the roles ‘co-producer’ and ‘quality controller’ are of
particular interest, as there, the interaction between the provider and the customer is focused
directly on the service provision. For the provider as the party, which is responsible for the
success of the co-creation, the integration of customers always entails both - a risk and an
opportunity. In the following we will have a closer look at the identified customer roles and their
valuation in former scientific work.
Customers can be involved in service co-creation as co-producers. Lengnick-Hall (1996)
focuses on customer orientation of service providers and aspects of quality management. The
customer is discussed in different roles – from a resource or product, to a user and a buyer.
Furthermore customers are examined as co-producers, with “influence […] on quality resulting
from [their] work activities” (Lengnick-Hall, 1996). Wilson, Zeithaml, Bitner, & Gremler,
(2012) emphasize the alignment of providers towards their customer, by describing service
marketing supporting the “uniqueness of services, keeping the customer at the centre”.
Customers may be seen as “assets to be valued, developed and retained”, for enabling them to act
as “one-time revenue producers” (Wilson, Zeithaml, Bitner, & Gremler, 2012). Customer
involvement is often associated with product development (Lagrosen, 2005) during different
stages (initial, final or continuously).
With their expectations, customers can function as quality controller of the estimated
service result. By being integrated trough the provider into the service co-creation, customers are
able to force decisions by giving their feedback about their service experience. Customers “judge
quality based on multiple factors relevant to the context” (Wilson, Zeithaml, Bitner, & Gremler,
2012). Setting high customer satisfaction as success criteria, forces providers to integrate the
customer and react directly on his quality assumption. The customer then acts as an
“organizational consultant”, who “is in a unique position to offer guidance to the service firm”
(Bettencourt, 1997). By giving his feedback, the customer is able to cause changes in the
provider’s performance.
In production theory a concept called ‘production factors’ (internal and external) exists
(Flandel & Blaga, 2004). Internal factors are entities that are provided by the producer. The
customer supplies the external factors. The provider cannot produce or buy external factors on
the market. Also the associated explicit knowledge is under control of the service customer. The
producer is forced to integrate internal and external factors into production processes where so
called factor combination occurs. This implies that both sides have to provide resources during
co-creation (Frisch, 2009). In contrast to production factors, we present a concept extended to the
customer domain. Using customer factors we demonstrate its applicability on services. In
contrast to the concept of ‘service system’ (Spohrer, Maglio, Bailey, & Gruhl, 2007), we take a
provider’s perspective. Therefore, the contribution of the customer is of special interest.
Furthermore, we describe the customer’s input with dedicated customer factors.

To measure the quantitative effects (service costs) of customer involvement we rely on
time. Conventional Activity-Based Costing (ABC) (Cooper & Kaplan, 1988) and the further
development of Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) (Anderson & Kaplan, 2007) are
well-known approaches to account for service costs. Due to the similarity between overhead
