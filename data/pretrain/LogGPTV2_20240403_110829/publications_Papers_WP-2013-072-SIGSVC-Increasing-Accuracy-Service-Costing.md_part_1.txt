**Abstract:**
Service providers require accurate cost calculations to make sound economic decisions and manage human resources effectively. However, existing costing methods, such as Activity-Based Costing (ABC), often overlook the impact of customer involvement, leading to imprecise cost estimates. This paper introduces a three-layered approach that integrates customer factors, such as experience, company size, and internet connection speed, into cost accounting. By using Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC), we compute the influence of these factors on service costs, thereby increasing the accuracy of cost calculations. Our approach is demonstrated through an application scenario in requirements engineering for complex software integration projects, using data from an international software provider.

**Introduction:**
Services have become a significant driver of economic growth, presenting new challenges for service providers in both B2B and B2C contexts. One key challenge is the mandatory involvement of customers in the co-creation of services, which can positively or negatively affect service costs. According to Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic, the customer is a co-producer of the service, and their contributions, such as knowledge and competencies, are crucial for the success of the service system.

Our research aims to enhance the accuracy of service cost calculations by incorporating customer individuality into cost accounting. The uncertainty introduced by customers during the co-creation process is a primary reason for imprecise cost estimates. To address this, we analyze the service requirements engineering phase of complex software integration projects, which can last from 3 to 24 months and have budgets up to 2 million Euros. Project managers and software developers find it challenging to estimate the time and associated costs for this service, often relying on implicit considerations of customer factors without a systematic approach.

**Structure of the Paper:**
- **Section 2:** Related Work - Discusses the roles of customers in service co-creation and the production factors involved.
- **Section 3:** Customer Factor Approach - Describes our three-layered approach for integrating customer factors into cost accounting.
- **Section 4:** Evaluation - Presents the evaluation of our approach using data from an international software provider.
- **Conclusion:** Summarizes the findings and outlines future research directions.

**Related Work:**
In service co-creation, customers can assume various roles, such as co-producers and quality controllers. These roles are critical for the success of the service provision. Lengnick-Hall (1996) emphasizes the importance of customer orientation and quality management, where customers can influence the quality of the service through their work activities. Wilson et al. (2012) highlight the need for service providers to keep the customer at the center, viewing them as assets to be valued and developed.

Customers also function as quality controllers, providing feedback that can drive changes in the provider's performance. In production theory, the concept of 'production factors' distinguishes between internal factors (provided by the producer) and external factors (supplied by the customer). The integration of these factors is essential for successful co-creation. Our approach extends this concept to the customer domain, using specific customer factors to measure the quantitative effects on service costs.

**To measure the quantitative effects (service costs) of customer involvement, we rely on time. Conventional Activity-Based Costing (ABC) and its advanced form, Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC), are well-known methods for accounting for service costs. Due to the similarity between overhead and direct costs, TDABC provides a more accurate way to account for the time and resources invested by both the provider and the customer.**

This paper will detail our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in increasing the accuracy of service costing.
