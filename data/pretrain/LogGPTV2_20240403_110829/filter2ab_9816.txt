Adversaries may exploit the `control.exe` process to proxy the execution of malicious payloads. `Control.exe` is a legitimate Windows binary responsible for executing Control Panel items, which are utilities that enable users to view and modify various system settings. By leveraging `control.exe`, attackers can disguise their malicious activities as normal system operations, thereby evading detection.
