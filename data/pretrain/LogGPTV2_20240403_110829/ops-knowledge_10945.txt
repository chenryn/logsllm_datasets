User: I need to run a process, wait a few hours, kill it, and start it again.  Is there an easy way that I can accomplish this with Python or Bash?  I can run it in the background but how do I identify it to use kill on it?
Assistant: One idea: Save the process's PID (returned by fork() in your child process) to a file, then either schedule a cron job to kill it or kill it manually, reading the PID from the file.
Another option: Create a shell script wrapper that automatically kills and restarts the process. Same as above, but you can keep the PID in memory, sleep for as long as you need, kill the process, then loop.
