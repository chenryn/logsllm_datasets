User: This is a weird bug. I know it's something funky going on with my PATH variable, but no idea how to fix it.
If I have a script C:\Test\test.py and I execute it from within IDLE, it works fine. If I open up Command Prompt using Run>>cmd.exe and navigate manually it works fine. But if I use Windows 7's convenient Right Click on folder >> Command Prompt Here then type test.py it fails with import errors.
I also cannot just type "python" to reach a python shell session if I use the latter method above.
Any ideas?
Edit: printing the python path for the command prompt that works yields the correct paths. Printing it on the non-working "Command prompt here" yields: Environment variable python not defined".
Assistant: You can check the currently present enviroment variables with the "set" command on the command line. For python to work you need at least PYTHONPATH pointing to your python libs and the path to python.exe should be included in your PATH variable.
