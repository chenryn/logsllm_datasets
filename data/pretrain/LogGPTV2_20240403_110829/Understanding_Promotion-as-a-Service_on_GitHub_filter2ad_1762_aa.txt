ABSTRACT
As the world’s leading software development platform, GitHub has
become a social networking site for programmers and recruiters
who leverage its social features, such as star and fork, for career and
business development. However, in this paper, we found a group
of GitHub accounts that conducted promotion services in GitHub,
called “promoters”, by performing paid star and fork operations on
specified repositories. We also uncovered a stealthy way of tamper-
ing with historical commits, through which these promoters are
able to fake commits retroactively. By exploiting such a promotion
service, any GitHub user can pretend to be a skillful developer with
high influence.
To understand promotion services in GitHub, we first investi-
gated the underground promotion market of GitHub and identified
1,023 suspected promotion accounts from the market. Then, we
developed an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to detect pro-
motion accounts from all active users extracted from GH Archive
ranging from 2015 to 2019. In total, we detected 63,872 suspected
promotion accounts. We further analyzed these suspected promo-
tion accounts, showing that (1) a hidden functionality in GitHub
is abused to boost the reputation of an account by forging histor-
ical commits and (2) a group of small businesses exploit GitHub
promotion services to promote their products. We estimated that
suspicious promoters could have made a profit of $3.41 million and
$4.37 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION
GitHub was founded in 2008 and has now become the most im-
portant code management and sharing website. According to a
2019 GitHub Report [11], there are more than 40 million devel-
opers, more than 44 million repositories created, and 2.9 million
organizations within GitHub. In addition to being used as a code
repository, GitHub also integrates several functionality for online
socialization, resembling those of Facebook and Twitter. In fact,
developers can watch, star, and fork repositories of others, introduc-
ing social communications. By watching a repository, developers
can receive notifications for new pull requests and issues that are
created. Starring a repository means a developer is interested in
this project and would pay sustained attention on it. Forking a
repository enables other developers to build their own repositories
based on the current one. This means the code in this repository can
be reused effectively. Those functions encourage the contribution
of high-quality code and lower the obstruction of developing new
open-source projects.
GitHub’s Impact on Job Recruiting. Due to its prominent role
in the software community, the number of stars, watches, and forks
attached to a GitHub user or repository has been considered a strong
indicator of coding skills, and it is used as a metric when screening
job applicants. For example, Devskiller, a developer screening and
online interview platform, states that “Stars and forks are a sign
of good, usable code” and “good code is forked and starred a lot,
so pay attention to these elements” [12]. In Zhaopin [23], the most
popular online recruitment service provider in China, many job
advertisements related to software development require applicants
to have more than a certain number of stars on their owned reposi-
tories. The most common requirement is to own a repository with
at least 100 GitHub stars.
GitHub Abuse. With such similar requirements, some develop-
ers attempt to manipulate the social statistics of their own GitHub

accounts by purchasing stars and forks, which then boosts the un-
derground “Promotion-as-a-Service” business for GitHub that sells
stars and forks for profit. In fact, since 2018, there have been some
scattered reports about such fraudulent activities [4, 6]. In 2019,
even SK Telecom, the biggest mobile service provider in Korea, is
reported abusing GitHub stars by giving free drinks to accounts
for starring a specified repository [21]. Although this Promotion-
as-a-Service on GitHub is another type of fraud and is not allowed
in most instances, so far, there is no systematic study on this issue,
not to mention a deep understanding of the problem’s scale and
fraudsters’ strategies.
Our Studies. In this paper, we performed the first large-scale
measurement and analysis of Promotion-as-a-Service on GitHub.
First, we crawled GitHub logs from 2015 to 2019 in GH Archive [14],
which is a project recording public user events on GitHub. The log
files consist of more than 20 event types, such as commits, forks,
watches, tickets, comments, and member changes. These events are
aggregated into buckets separated by hours. The total size of the
log files is 4.79TB.
Our first task is to identify activities related to this type of fraud.
Although the problem is similar to crowdturfing attacks, in which
human workers are paid to commit fraudulent online activities
for a buyer, existing detection systems like those used on social
networks [41, 46, 51, 52] cannot be directly applied because the user
activities in GitHub are far more complicated than just “post,” “like,”
“follow,” and “comment”. For GitHub promoters, they have more
choices to conceal their promotion tracks by forking, watching,
issuing in a popular repository, or even faking updates to their
own repositories. As such, we decided to build a new detection
system tailored to this problem. To obtain ground-truth datasets,
we created a repository in GitHub with only a few script files and
then ordered 1,023 stars and forks by taking advantage of GitHub
promotion services. Tracing back from these paid stars and forks,
we identified a list of promotion accounts. The activity histories of
these promotion accounts were also extracted from log files that
we crawled from GH Archive.
After a pilot analysis, we trained an SVM (Support Vector Ma-
chine) classifier by using the data related to these promotion ac-
counts and reputable GitHub accounts we sampled elaborately from
normal GitHub accounts. We applied the SVM classifier on all of the
accounts extracted from the log files and detected 63,872 suspected
promotion accounts. We checked their homepages in GitHub and
found that a large ratio of suspected promotion accounts had not
yet been banned by GitHub during our study.
Next, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on these suspected
promotion accounts to understand how they operate and gain profit.
We analyzed the organization distribution of these suspected ac-
counts, clustering them into groups to understand their topological
structure and relations. Then we examined suspected promotion
accounts to check if they were banned by GitHub itself, and found
that most of them had not been detected yet. We further analyzed
the characteristics of fake stars and forks, profile, and the regis-
tration time of these suspected accounts, revealing more intrinsic
characteristics of these suspected promotion accounts.
Moreover, we identified different features between normal and
suspicious promoted repositories. Regarding the business and oper-
ational models of this GitHub fraud, there are two main interest-
ing observations. First, we witnessed that a hidden functionality
in GitHub can be abused to boost the reputation of a promotion
account by forging the time and frequency of historical commits.
Second, we observed that some software companies published parts
of their products’ source code or instructions on GitHub and paid
promotion services to boost these repositories, targeting the GitHub
trending list, in order to attract potential customers to purchase
their products.
Contributions. We summarize our main contributions below:
(1) We performed the first comprehensive study on GitHub pro-
motion and uncovered the strategies used by suspicious promoters.
We found that stars and forks of a repository are not trustworthy
indicators of a developer’s coding skill, due to the use of fraudulent
promotion services. Based on the GitHub log data in GH Archive,
we estimate that suspicious promoters made a profit of about $3.41
million and $4.37 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
(2) We conducted a large-scale measurement on more than 40
million GitHub accounts by examining the data from 2015 to 2019.
We developed an SVM classifier and trained it through the publicly
available user historical activity data. We evaluated our classifier
using an F1-measure, achieving an accuracy of 99.1% on the ground-
truth dataset. We identified 63,872 suspected promotion accounts
from GitHub accounts.
(3) We shed new light on how this promotion service is operated.
We also disclosed a hidden functionality of GitHub that allows a
user to pretend to be a skillful developer retroactively. We reported
this type of abuse to GitHub, and they indicated that they would
pass our request on to the right team for remediation.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefs the
background of GitHub. Section 3 elaborates on how we processed
data and built an SVM classifier to detect promotion accounts. Sec-
tion 4 presents the large-scale measurement study to uncover the
characteristics of suspected promotion accounts. Section 5 demon-
strates how promoters help their clients to forge a hard-working
account by tampering with historical commits and how small busi-
nesses exploit GitHub to promote their products. Section 6 discusses
related issues and possible countermeasures. Section 7 surveys re-
lated works, and finally, Section 8 concludes our work.
2 BACKGROUND
GitHub provides a web-based hosting service for code hosting and
version control by using Git. Therefore, it offers all the functions of
Git (i.e., distributed version control and source code management) as
well as its own features, including access control and collaboration
features [27]. GitHub has different kinds of plans for enterprise and
individual users. In general, an individual developer prefers to use
a free account to host open-source or private repositories. It was
reported that GitHub has more than 40 million developers as of
December 2019 [11].
Since GitHub has social-networking functions, e.g., starring and
forking, it facilitates social interactions among developers. The
number of a repository’s stars and forks indicates a developer’s
skills to some extent. During job screenings, a candidate could

it is not hard for promotion service providers to set up enough
promotion accounts and operate for a long time in GitHub.
Second, in addition to individual sellers, we also discovered a
few websites dedicated to GitHub promotion services. One of them
is called GitStar [7], which serves as a platform for users to ex-
change their stars and forks. We inspected the website and found
some interesting characteristics, which are described below: (1)
This website is not opened on the publicly known port 80 but 88.
We speculate that the website owner attempted to avoid public
attention. Moreover, we queried the domain name gitstar.top
record in passive DNS provided by Farsight [19] and found that
it had pointed to various IP addresses over time. This shows that
the site migrates more often than normal ones. (2) This website
enforces web cloaking. We received no response when we visited
the website from IP addresses out of China. This shows that the
main customers of this website are located in China. (3) During the
registration process, the website requires the same username as
the one used in GitHub and checks the ownership by asking the
registrant to star a famous repository [16] in GitHub. After registra-
tion, developers can post the repositories that solicit stars and forks.
GitStar acts as a bulletin board that lists all of these repositories.
All members of GitStar can star and fork the repositories listed,
regardless of the repository’s content or quality. The publisher is
supposed to return the favor to other repositories when receiving
stars or forks. If not, the website will treat it as an “owe.” All of the
owe information is open and members of the website can deter-
mine if a repository is worthy of starring or forking by checking
the publisher’s owe information. (4) We also observed that GitHub
API is leveraged by GitStar to query an account’s star and fork
information. During the registration process, GitStar can check
the ownership of an account by examining if the account indeed
performed the star operation on the repository required. During
operation step, if user 𝐴 has finished a star operation on user 𝐵’s
repository, GitStar is able to validate whether user 𝐵 performs the
same on 𝐴’s repository through GitHub API. This is another abuse
of GitHub API in this type of blackhat promotion.
Third, there are also a number of IM groups through which
GitHub users can exchange stars and forks for free or profit. We
identified more than 20 groups by searching “GitHub star each
other” (translated from Chinese) in QQ and WeChat (IM tools like
whatsapp). The largest group has more than 1,020 members and
charges a “membership” fee. To investigate the market, we paid
$1.49 to join the group. The owner of this group can earn more
than $1,520 by just collecting the “membership” fees. We also joined
three other IM groups for more information and comparison. After
monitoring these groups for more than one year, we found that
on average, there were about 20 repositories asking for promo-
tion every day. About 20 to 30 members in the chat group actively
confirmed that they had given stars or forks for the promoted repos-
itories. We also contacted the users in these groups who operated
