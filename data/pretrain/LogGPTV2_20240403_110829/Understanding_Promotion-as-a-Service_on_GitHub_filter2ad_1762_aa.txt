## Abstract
GitHub, the world's leading software development platform, has evolved into a social networking site for programmers and recruiters. It leverages features like starring and forking to facilitate career and business development. However, we have identified a group of GitHub accounts, referred to as "promoters," that provide paid services to boost repository metrics through stars and forks. We also uncovered a stealthy method for tampering with historical commits, allowing these promoters to retroactively fake commits. By exploiting such promotion services, any GitHub user can falsely present themselves as a highly skilled and influential developer.

To understand these promotion services, we first investigated the underground market and identified 1,023 suspected promotion accounts. We then developed an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to detect promotion accounts from all active users in GH Archive from 2015 to 2019, identifying 63,872 suspected promotion accounts. Our analysis revealed that:
1. A hidden functionality in GitHub is being abused to boost account reputations by forging historical commits.
2. Small businesses are using GitHub promotion services to promote their products.

We estimated that suspicious promoters could have made a profit of $3.41 million in 2018 and $4.37 million in 2019.

## Introduction
GitHub, founded in 2008, has become the most important code management and sharing website. According to the 2019 GitHub Report, there are over 40 million developers, 44 million repositories, and 2.9 million organizations on GitHub. Besides serving as a code repository, GitHub integrates several social features, such as watching, starring, and forking, which resemble those of Facebook and Twitter. These features encourage high-quality code contributions and lower the barriers to developing new open-source projects.

### GitHub’s Impact on Job Recruiting
Due to its significant role in the software community, the number of stars, watches, and forks attached to a GitHub user or repository is often used as a metric to evaluate coding skills during job screenings. For example, Devskiller, a developer screening and online interview platform, states that "Stars and forks are a sign of good, usable code" [12]. In Zhaopin, a popular Chinese recruitment service, many job advertisements require applicants to have a certain number of stars on their repositories, typically at least 100 stars.

### GitHub Abuse
Some developers attempt to manipulate their social statistics by purchasing stars and forks, leading to the rise of an underground "Promotion-as-a-Service" business on GitHub. Although this type of fraud is not allowed, there has been no systematic study on the issue, let alone a deep understanding of its scale and the strategies employed by fraudsters.

### Our Studies
In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale measurement and analysis of Promotion-as-a-Service on GitHub. We crawled GitHub logs from 2015 to 2019 in GH Archive, which records public user events. The log files, totaling 4.79TB, include over 20 event types such as commits, forks, watches, tickets, comments, and member changes.

#### Identifying Fraudulent Activities
To identify activities related to this type of fraud, we created a repository with only a few script files and ordered 1,023 stars and forks using GitHub promotion services. Tracing back from these paid stars and forks, we identified a list of promotion accounts and extracted their activity histories from the log files.

#### Developing the SVM Classifier
After a pilot analysis, we trained an SVM classifier using data from these promotion accounts and reputable GitHub accounts. Applying the classifier to all accounts in the log files, we detected 63,872 suspected promotion accounts. Many of these accounts had not yet been banned by GitHub during our study.

#### Comprehensive Analysis
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of these suspected promotion accounts to understand their operations and profit models. We analyzed the organizational distribution, clustering them to understand their topological structure and relationships. We also examined the characteristics of fake stars and forks, profiles, and registration times, revealing intrinsic characteristics of these accounts.

#### Business and Operational Models
Our analysis revealed two key observations:
1. A hidden functionality in GitHub allows users to boost their reputation by forging the time and frequency of historical commits.
2. Some software companies publish parts of their product source code or instructions on GitHub and pay for promotion services to boost their repositories, aiming to attract potential customers.

### Contributions
1. **Comprehensive Study:** We performed the first comprehensive study on GitHub promotion, uncovering the strategies used by suspicious promoters. Based on GH Archive data, we estimate that suspicious promoters made a profit of $3.41 million in 2018 and $4.37 million in 2019.
2. **Large-Scale Measurement:** We conducted a large-scale measurement on over 40 million GitHub accounts from 2015 to 2019. We developed and trained an SVM classifier, achieving an accuracy of 99.1% on the ground-truth dataset. We identified 63,872 suspected promotion accounts.
3. **Operational Insights:** We shed light on how this promotion service operates and disclosed a hidden functionality that allows users to pretend to be skillful developers retroactively. We reported this abuse to GitHub, and they indicated they would pass our request to the appropriate team for remediation.

## Background
GitHub provides a web-based hosting service for code hosting and version control using Git. It offers distributed version control, source code management, access control, and collaboration features. As of December 2019, GitHub had over 40 million developers. Its social-networking functions, such as starring and forking, facilitate interactions among developers. The number of stars and forks on a repository is often used as an indicator of a developer's skills during job screenings.

### GitHub Promotion Market
1. **Individual Sellers:** Promotion service providers can easily set up and operate promotion accounts on GitHub.
2. **Dedicated Websites:** We discovered websites like GitStar, which serve as platforms for exchanging stars and forks. GitStar enforces web cloaking and requires the same username as the one used on GitHub to verify ownership. It also uses GitHub API to check star and fork information.
3. **IM Groups:** There are numerous IM groups on platforms like QQ and WeChat where GitHub users can exchange stars and forks for free or profit. We joined several of these groups and monitored their activities for over a year, finding that about 20 repositories requested promotion daily, with 20-30 members actively confirming their participation.

By understanding these mechanisms, we can better address the issue of fraudulent promotion on GitHub and develop effective countermeasures.
