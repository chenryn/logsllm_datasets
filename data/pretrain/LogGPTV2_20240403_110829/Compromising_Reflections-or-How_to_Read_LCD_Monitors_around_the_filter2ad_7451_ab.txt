a larger magniﬁcation, hence indirectly inﬂuences the
exposure time.) Given experimental values for a given
setup, this allows us to at least estimate the necessary
exposure time for settings that vary only in these pa-
rameters, e.g., when deciding which telescope size is
necessary for a given setup. Furthermore, by compar-
ing our equipment with other available equipment, we
at least obtain an estimate when the attacker does not
use speciﬁcally manufactured (and possibly very expen-
sive) equipment.
In theory, there is no upper bound on the exposure
time. However, changing monitor images, moving ob-
jects, and air turbulences caused by heating or air con-
ditioning can blur the image. Exposure times of several
seconds are possible; we have taken most pictures with
exposure times of two seconds. For moving mirrors, in
particular for the human eye, much shorter exposure
times are required, as the rapid movement of the eye
substantially blurs images even after a 0.1 seconds.
3. Experimental Results for Low-cost
Equipment
We now present experimental results using low-cost
equipment that illustrate the feasibility of the attack.
The experiments show that many objects that may be
found at a usual workplace can be exploited to retrieve
information on a computer’s display by an outsider.
In the following, we consider the test image depicted
in Figure 4 shown on the 15”LCD screen of a ThinkPad
T43. We then placed a reﬂecting object on the table
close to the LCD screen (except for the cases where we
investigated the reﬂections in the eye of the user) and
photographed the reﬂection of the screen in the object
from various distances through a telescope.
We used the following camera and two telescopes for
our tests:
• An SLR digital camera Canon EOS 400D with a
resolution of 10.1 mega-pixels and a sensor size
of 22.2mm × 14.8mm; it costs approx. 550 Euros
(800 dollars).
Some pictures were taken using a Sigma macro lens
with focal length f = 50mm and an approximate
aperture of D = 18mm (F = 2.8). Using this
lens with a smaller sensor yields a slightly cropped
image, comparable to images taken with an 80mm
lens.
• A refractor telescope: a Skywatcher ED 80 PRO
with focal length f = 600mm and an aperture of
D = 80mm. This telescope has very good imaging
qualities, but a quite small aperture. Its price is
approximately 380 Euros (550 dollars).
• A Newtonian reﬂector telescope: a Skywatcher
Dobson 200 with focal length f = 1000mm and an
aperture of D = 200mm. Its simple design has im-
pacts on image quality, mostly on color ﬁdelity and
distortion, which both are of only minor impor-
tance for our task. Its larger diameter, however, al-
lows for a higher resolution according to Rayleigh’s
Criterion and for shorter exposure times. It costs
approx. 300 Euros (435 dollars). Unless explicitly
stated otherwise, the experiments described below
were conducted using this telescope.
Both telescopes were used with the Canon EOS 400D,
directly mounted on the telescope with a projection
camera adapter using a 25mm eye piece and extension
tubes to allow for the short object distances. The cam-
era was triggered by remote control and conﬁgured to

3.2. Reﬂections in Human Eyes
Another reﬂecting object that is prevalent in all of-
ﬁces is the human eye. In fact, the reﬂecting properties
of the cornea, the foremost part of the human eye, are
excellent, as it is designed not to distort the light beams
passing it (this can be seen in Figure 1). On the down-
side, the radius of the cornea is very small, and the
reﬂection is quite dark, requiring long exposure times.
The rapid movement of the eye causes the images
taken with our equipment to be rather blurred when
taken from a distance, see Figure 8. For photograph-
ing reﬂections in the eye a high magniﬁcation is used.
Since the eye itself does not reﬂect much light, the ex-
posure time constitutes the limiting factor in these ex-
periments.
Figure 9 shows the reﬂections from a short distance,
taken with a macro lens, where the eye is at a nor-
mal distance from the monitor. The readability of the
text is essentially limited by the resolution of the cap-
tured image.
(The bar in the rightmost picture has
a height of 18 pixels, consequently the line below was
recorded with a resolution of 9 pixels. Although this
does not (yet) constitute a practical attack, it serves
as a strong indication that the reﬂections are of high
quality, and that they could be captured using more
expensive equipment.
3.3. Reﬂections in Eyeglasses
Eyeglasses are another prevalent reﬂecting object.
In fact, glasses substantially facilitate the attack, as
they typically have surfaces with a large radius.
It
turned out that even anti-reﬂecting coatings do not dis-
turb the attack. The pictures in Figures 10 were taken
while the glasses were worn by their respective owner.
Both glasses had an anti-reﬂecting coating.
3.4. Reﬂections in Other Objects
Surprisingly many objects yield suitable reﬂections.
The following three examples were captured from a dis-
tance of 5 meters. The reﬂections in an empty wine
glass are shown in Figure 11. The double reﬂections
are caused by the two faces of one side of the glass. As
the radii of both surfaces are essentially equal, both re-
ﬂections can be seen sharply. The other side of the glass
cannot be seen. A glass full of wine would oﬀer even
better reﬂections, because of the darker background.
An ordinary plastic bottle produces reasonable reﬂec-
tions as well, see Figure 12. Depending on the exact
position and the exact shape of the bottle, the image
can be distorted; in some cases even the last line is

experiments. Font sizes are 300pt, 150pt,

wait between moving its mirror and taking the actual
photo (mirror lockup) to reduce the eﬀect of vibrations.
We have investigated the following reﬂecting ob-
jects: Various tea pots, human eyes, eyeglasses, drink-
ing glasses, bottles, and spoons.
In the following we
describe the results obtained with these objects.
3.1. Reﬂections in Tea Pots
We obtained very good reﬂections in various tea
pots. We frequently used the tea pot shown in Fig-
ure 5, which is the tea pot that one of the authors uses
daily. Figure 6 shows two additional tea pots that we
investigated.
The reﬂections shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 as
well as in most of the following ﬁgures were taken in-
doors. At the time of most of the experiments, the
outdoor and indoor temperatures diﬀered by approx-
imately 20 degrees Celsius and poorly insulated win-
dows caused heavy air turbulence. In combination with
the quite long exposure time of one second, this caused
blurred images, so we photographed the reﬂections in-
doors. Our experiments on a warmer day indicate
that this does not constitute a serious problem, as it
does not occur when temperatures outside are warmer,
when better insulated glass is used, or when sensors
of higher sensitivity are used, which leads to shorter
exposure times. Alternatively, one can resort to a tech-
nique used in astronomical photography, where air tur-
bulences cause blurred images: Many images are taken
with very short exposure times; Each of these images
is heavily underexposed, but subject to very little blur.
Then approx. 10% of the best images are added to ob-
tain a single, bright and unblurred image.
Figure 7 shows the reﬂection of a Word document
with a font size of 12pt, from a distance of 5 meters.

its inner and outer side, see Figure 13.
3.5. Printouts Reﬂecting in a Tea Pot
Although a tea pot theoretically can reﬂect all the
objects in a room, and our work shows that it reﬂects
the monitor quite well, the monitor is a bright tar-
get compared with paperwork lying on the desk. Fig-
ure 14 shows that the tea pot also reﬂects paperwork
and could be used to cover cases where the attacker
does not have a direct view on the paper. In Figure 14,
the paper was placed next to the tea pot and the work
space was lit by an ordinary desk lamp. In this case,
the paper and the reﬂecting object (tea pot) were very
close and the image quality is excellent. One can easily
read the reﬂection of the 10pt font paper.
3.6. Large Distances
For distances beyond approx. 10 meters between re-
ﬂector and camera, diﬀraction substantially limits the
resolution we can obtain with our low-cost telescope
(cf. Section 5 and Table 1). Of course one could sim-
ply use a larger telescope, but even the substantially
lower resolution can impose a substantial threat. Fig-
ure 15 shows two images captured over a distance of 40
meters in which graphical information is clearly read-
able, e.g., business charts. At the authors’ campus, this
is the distance between two computer science buildings,
which means that this quality is realistic when spying
from one building to the other.

5. Practical Limits of this Approach
To better understand the implications of this attack
and for providing concerned people with suitable de-
fense mechanisms it is important to study the princi-
pal limitations of our approach. Our bounds are not
absolute, but they depend on the size of the telescope.
However, since the price tag of the telescope is directly
related to its size, one can at least estimate a lower
bound for the costs of an attack in a given setting.
Furthermore, in many settings there might be an upper
bound on the size of the telescope because the telescope
needs to be hidden somewhere.
5.1. Based on the Rayleigh Criterion
The ﬁrst lower-bound can be derived from the
Rayleigh Criterion, cf. Section 2.2. We have

We now present experimental results using more ex-
pensive equipment: a Dobson telescope of excellent
quality with mirror diameter D = 60cm and focal
length f = 2.6m. A used telescope sells for about
19’000 Euros (approx. 27’500 dollars). The telescope
is shown in Figure 16, along with an image of the re-
ﬂections in a tea pot from a distance of 30 meters. The
quality of the captured image is compliant with the
following theoretical observations. The Rayleigh Cri-
terion gives a linear correlation between the telescope
diameter and the distance where images of a constant
quality can be taken. Furthermore, the brightness of
the image decreases quadratically when the distance in-
creases, and the area of the mirror, i.e., its capability
to gather light, increases quadratically with increasing
mirror diameter. Thus overall, the relation between
distance and mirror diameter is also linear.
For illustration we give some concrete values in Table 1.
