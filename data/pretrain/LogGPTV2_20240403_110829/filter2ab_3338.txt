**ATT&CK Technique Name:** nbtstat

**Description:**
The `nbtstat` command is a network utility that can be used to query and display NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocol statistics. It is particularly useful for discovering local NetBIOS domain names, as well as other NetBIOS-related information, such as the IP addresses of hosts within a given domain.

**Usage:**
- **Discovering Local NetBIOS Domain Names:**
  - The `nbtstat` command can be utilized to enumerate and display the names of local NetBIOS domains, which may provide valuable information for network reconnaissance or system enumeration in a cybersecurity context.

**Example:**
- To list the local NetBIOS name table, you can use the following command:
  ```shell
  nbtstat -n
  ```

This tool is often leveraged by both system administrators and threat actors to gather information about networked systems and their configurations.
