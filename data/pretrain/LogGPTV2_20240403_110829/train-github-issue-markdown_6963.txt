by **PI:EMAIL** :
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    1. Setup a web-server serving https with a certificate from a local CA
    2. Point the program listed at http://play.golang.org/p/iKScTFUQl3 at the server
    3. The program is unable to complete the TLS handshake.
    What is the expected output?
    The program should complete a TLS handshake and exit without errors.
    What do you see instead?
    Two error conditions:
     1. if certificate verification is enabled, it states that the certificate is signed by an unknown authority
     2. if certificate verification is disabled, it states that there is a bad record MAC.
    I have verified that the certificate chain is complete, that the certificate and key are
    the correct pair.
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    gc
    Which operating system are you using?
    Ubuntu 10.04 amd 64bit
    Debian 6 amd 64bit
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')
    Tested on 1.0.2, 1.0.3, tip
    Please provide any additional information below.
    This could be a problem with my CA setup.  However the CA and the test web server
    satisfy both gnutls and openssl.  Both report the certificate chain as being valid.  I
    can make the connection with anything else.
    I have attached a sample certificate, key, and ca certificate that I tested against.  It
    is a horribly weak key.  However key length does not seem to change the outcome.  I have
    tested this with 512 bit and 2048 bit rsa keys.
    I ran into this issue while attempting to consume a https resource in a program I am
    working on.
