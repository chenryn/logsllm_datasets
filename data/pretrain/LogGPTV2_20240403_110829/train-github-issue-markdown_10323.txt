We seem to have broken compatibility with fortran-interface-only BLAS
libraries. Specifically, we use `cblas_zdotc_sub` and `cblas_cdotc_sub`, which
don't exist in some BLAS implementations such as CentOS 7's default `blas`
package. Is this something we want to work around, revert, or just live with?
