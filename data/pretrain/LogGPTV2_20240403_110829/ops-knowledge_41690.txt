Question: A penetration tester is evaluating a web application for security vulnerabilities and suspects that the application may be prone to SSI injection. The tester has identified that the application is running on a server that supports SSI directives and has found potential user input vectors. To confirm the vulnerability, which of the following techniques should the tester use to determine if the SSI injection is exploitable?
"A": "Injecting SSI directives as user input to check if the server executes the directive.",
"B": "Scanning the application with an antivirus to detect the presence of SSI directives.",
"C": "Encrypting the user input to see if the application decrypts it and executes SSI directives.",
"D": "Performing a network sniffing attack to intercept SSI directives in transit."
Answer: A
