ABSTRACT
As the cloud computing market continues to grow, the cloud plat-
form is becoming an attractive target for attackers to disrupt ser-
vices and steal data, and to compromise resources to launch at-
tacks. In this paper, using three months of NetFlow data in 2013
from a large cloud provider, we present the ﬁrst large-scale char-
acterization of inbound attacks towards the cloud and outbound at-
tacks from the cloud. We investigate nine types of attacks ranging
from network-level attacks such as DDoS to application-level at-
tacks such as SQL injection and spam. Our analysis covers the
complexity, intensity, duration, and distribution of these attacks,
highlighting the key challenges in defending against attacks in the
cloud. By characterizing the diversity of cloud attacks, we aim to
motivate the research community towards developing future secu-
rity solutions for cloud systems.

INTRODUCTION
The cloud computing market reached $40 billion in 2014 with
a rapid growth of 23%-27% per year [1]. Hosting tens of thou-
sands of online services, the cloud platform is increasingly becom-
ing both the target and source of attacks. A recent survey of data
center operators indicates that half of them experienced DDoS at-
tacks, with 94% of those experiencing regular attacks [17]. More-
over, attackers can abuse hosted services or compromise VMs [30]
in the cloud to target external sites via deploying botnets [29], send-
ing spam [33, 44], selling VMs in the underground economy [23,
49], or launching DDoS attacks [21]. In April 2011, an attack on

the Sony Playstation network compromising more than 100 million
customer accounts was carried out by a malicious service hosted on
Amazon EC2 [20]. While there have been some reports of individ-
ual attacks on enterprise and cloud networks [10, 29], to the best
of our knowledge, there have not been any systematic measurement
studies of attacks on and off the cloud which can guide the design of
attack detection and mitigation systems. In fact, little has been pub-
lished about the prevalence, diversity, and characteristics of these
cloud-based attacks.
In this paper we investigate over 200 TB of NetFlow records
collected from dozens of edge routers spread across multiple ge-
ographically distributed data centers of a major cloud provider. We
group trafﬁc based on public virtual IPs (VIPs) assigned to each
cloud hosted service. We identify network-based attacks from the
NetFlow data using four key features as also used in prior work [19,
32, 38, 48]: (1) signiﬁcant trafﬁc volume (e.g., packets per sec-
ond), (2) abnormal fan-in or fan-out (e.g., number of unique clients
or number of connections), (3) abnormal packet header signatures
(e.g., TCP ﬂags), and (4) communication with Internet malicious
hosts [37]. Using these features, we identiﬁed nine types of attacks,
ranging from various DDoS attacks to application-level attacks such
as SQL injection and spam.
Due to sampling in the NetFlow data used in our study and the
fact that NetFlow lacks application-level information, we do not
aim at identifying all the attacks in the cloud.
Instead, our goal
is to understand the characteristics of attacks using low overhead
network-level information typically collected in many data center
networks. Thus, we take a conservative approach of setting the
attack detection thresholds to ensure that most of the attacks we
detect are real attacks.1
We validate the detected attacks against alerts from deployed se-
curity appliances and incident reports written by operators. Our de-
tected attacks cover 78.5% of the inbound attack alerts from DDoS
protection appliances and 83.7% of the incident reports on out-
bound attacks, due to the NetFlow sampling used in our study and
our conservative approach. Note that the cloud provider we stud-
ied deploys a combination of software and hardware appliances to
protect the infrastructure against such attacks.
Our broader goal is to (a) understand the key characteristics of
these attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of existing DDoS mit-
igation approaches and (b) analyze their implications on building
cloud-scale attack detection and mitigation solutions.
Although there have been many studies on Internet attacks, this
paper presents one of the ﬁrst analysis of the key characteristics of
attacks to and from the cloud based on a three-month dataset.
1These attacks may also include some trafﬁc anomalies caused by
ﬂash crowds or misconﬁgurations. We do not distinguish them be-
cause they all impact cloud services and it is an open problem to
accurately distinguish them from benign trafﬁc.
169We make the following main observations:
for inbound and outbound attacks (Section 3).
• We identify nine types of attacks and quantify their frequencies
• We ﬁnd that most VIPs experiencing attacks only incur one at-
tack incident in a day. There is a very small fraction of VIPs that
experience or generate many attacks (Section 4).
• We ﬁnd multi-vector attacks and combinations of inbound and
outbound attacks on the same VIP. While most attacks target only
one VIP, there are a few cases of multiple attacks that target 20-
60 VIPs simultaneously (Section 4).
• We observe high variations in attack throughput across time and
VIPs, requiring cloud security solutions to have dynamic resource
allocation over time and multiplexing of resources across VIPs.
Attacks often have short duration (within 10 minutes), which re-
quire fast attack detection and mitigation (Section 5).
• We investigate the origins and targets of inbound and outbound
attacks and identiﬁed the major types of Internet ASes that are
involved in cloud-related attacks (Section 6).
Scope and Limitations. Our study analyzed trafﬁc data from a sin-
gle cloud provider and thus it may not generalize to other providers.
However, the scale and diversity of our dataset, and our conversa-
tion with security operators (having a broader industry view and
some having worked at other cloud networks) suggests that similar
security challenges are likely faced by other providers. We col-
lected NetFlow records from data center edge routers before they
are ﬁltered by the security appliances. Thus, the attacks we de-
tected should not be interpreted as impacting the cloud infrastruc-
ture or services. Finally, since the trafﬁc measurement is at one-
minute granularity, it is likely to smooth the effect of short-lived
attack spikes. Overall, our study highlights the need for develop-
ing programmable (to handle attack diversity), scalable (to handle
varying intensity), and ﬂexible approaches (for individual tenants)
to protect against attacks.
2. DATASETS AND METHODOLOGY
We ﬁrst present the basic setup in a major cloud provider we stud-
ied, and then describe the datasets we collected and the methodol-
ogy for characterizing attacks.
2.1 Cloud provider overview
The cloud network we study comprises 10+ geographically dis-
tributed data centers across America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania,
which are connected to each other and to the Internet via edge
routers. Each data center hosts tens to hundreds of thousands of
servers. The cloud provider hosts more than 10,000 services includ-
ing web services, mobile application services, database and storage
services, and data analytics. Each service is assigned a public vir-
tual IP (VIP). The trafﬁc to the VIP is load balanced across a group
of virtual machines hosting the service; sometimes these VMs are
located across multiple data centers.
Such scale of services makes the cloud an attractive target for
inbound attacks.
Incoming trafﬁc to different services ﬁrst tra-
verses the edge routers and then the commercial security appliances
(e.g., Arbor [17]). These security appliances, typically designed
for enterprise-scale deployments, analyze inbound trafﬁc to protect
against a variety of well-known attacks such as TCP SYN ﬂood,
UDP ﬂood, ICMP ﬂood, and TCP NULL attacks; these appliances
use NetFlow records for trafﬁc monitoring. However, the detection
logic is often limited to known high-volume attacks. Thus they risk
missing other low-volume attack types which aim to probe vulnera-
bilities but that do not impact the cloud infrastructure such as stealth
port scans and application-level attacks e.g., spam, SQL injection.
To reduce false positives (noisy alerts), trafﬁc thresholds for alert-
ing can be set either on a per-tenant basis or across tenant groups
on these devices.
Attackers can also abuse the cloud resources to launch outbound
attacks. For instance, they can ﬁrst launch brute-force attacks (e.g.,
password guessing) to compromise vulnerable VMs in the cloud.
These compromised VMs may then be used for YouTube click fraud,
BitTorrent hosting, Bitcoin mining, spamming, malware propaga-
tion, or launching DDoS attacks. To mitigate outbound attacks, the
cloud provider we studied enforces several security mechanisms in-
cluding limiting the outbound bandwidth per VM, preventing IP
spooﬁng of egress trafﬁc, shutting down the misbehaving VMs and
isolating anomalous trafﬁc. To our knowledge, no prior work has
characterized the prevalence of outbound attacks from the cloud.
2.2 Dataset and attack detection methodology
We obtained more than 200TB NetFlow logs from a major cloud
provider over three months (May, Nov, and Dec 2013). The Net-
Flow logs collected for our study had a 1 in 4096 packet sampling
rate for both inbound and outbound trafﬁc at the edge routers of the
data centers, and aggregated over one-minute windows.2 Since the
edge routers (where we collect the logs) are located upstream of the
security appliances, the attacks we detect are likely mitigated before
they reach VMs hosting services in the cloud. We analyze the Net-
Flow data on Cosmos, a large scalable data storage system using
SCOPE [26], a programming framework similar to Map-Reduce.
Our SCOPE scripts use C# and SQL-like queries to perform the
analysis described below.
We aggregate the NetFlow data by VIP in each one-minute win-
dow, and study the trafﬁc to a VIP (inbound trafﬁc) and from the
same VIP (outbound trafﬁc). For each VIP in each time window,
we ﬁrst ﬁlter the trafﬁc based on the protocol number (e.g., UDP),
TCP ﬂags (e.g., TCP SYN), or port numbers (e.g., SQL trafﬁc is
ﬁltered by TCP trafﬁc with destination port 1433 or 3306). We then
identify nine types of attacks listed in Table 1. Our attack detection
is based on the following four network-level features:
Volume-based: Many volume-based attacks try to exhaust server
or infrastructure resources (e.g., memory, bandwidth) by sending
a large volume of trafﬁc via a speciﬁc protocol such as TCP SYN
and UDP ﬂoods, and DNS reﬂection attacks. We capture volume-
based attacks by identifying trafﬁc with large relative spikes. We
use sequential change point detection [19, 32] by comparing the
trafﬁc volume at the current time window with the Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of the past 10 time windows.
We then compare the difference with a change threshold of 100
packets per minute in NetFlow (1:4096 sampling rate), correspond-
ing to an estimated value of about 7K pps in the original trafﬁc. The
threshold is suggested by the cloud security team based on the net-
work capacity and prior attack incidents. As shown in Section 3.2,
using such threshold settings, we can verify many of the attacks
reported in the attack alerts and the incident reports.
Spread-based: For many services (e.g., mail, SQL, SSH), a sin-
gle VIP typically connects to only a few Internet hosts in normal
operation. Thus, if a VIP communicates with a large number of
Internet hosts, it is likely an anomaly. To identify such anomalies,
we use the NetFlow data to compute the spread of a VIP (i.e., the
number of distinct Internet IPs communicating with a VIP during
a time window) for inbound and outbound trafﬁc. We then capture
the relative spikes of the spread using sequential change point de-

volumes calculated based on the number in the NetFlow data and
the sampling rate.
