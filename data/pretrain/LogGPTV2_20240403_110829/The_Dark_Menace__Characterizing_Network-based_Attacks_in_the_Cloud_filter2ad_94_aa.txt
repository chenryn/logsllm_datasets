## Abstract
As the cloud computing market continues to expand, cloud platforms have become increasingly attractive targets for attackers. These attacks can disrupt services, steal data, and compromise resources to launch further attacks. In this paper, we present a large-scale characterization of inbound and outbound network-based attacks in the cloud using three months of NetFlow data from 2013, collected from a major cloud provider. We analyze nine types of attacks, ranging from network-level attacks like DDoS to application-level attacks such as SQL injection and spam. Our analysis covers the complexity, intensity, duration, and distribution of these attacks, highlighting the key challenges in defending against them. By characterizing the diversity of cloud attacks, we aim to motivate the research community to develop future security solutions for cloud systems.

## 1. Introduction
The cloud computing market reached $40 billion in 2014, with an annual growth rate of 23%-27% [1]. Hosting tens of thousands of online services, the cloud platform is becoming both a target and a source of attacks. A recent survey of data center operators indicates that half of them experienced DDoS attacks, with 94% experiencing regular attacks [17]. Additionally, attackers can abuse hosted services or compromise VMs [30] in the cloud to target external sites via deploying botnets [29], sending spam [33, 44], selling VMs in the underground economy [23, 49], or launching DDoS attacks [21]. For example, in April 2011, an attack on the Sony PlayStation network compromised over 100 million customer accounts, carried out by a malicious service hosted on Amazon EC2 [20].

While there have been reports of individual attacks on enterprise and cloud networks [10, 29], there has been no systematic measurement study of attacks on and off the cloud to guide the design of detection and mitigation systems. Little has been published about the prevalence, diversity, and characteristics of these cloud-based attacks.

In this paper, we investigate over 200 TB of NetFlow records collected from dozens of edge routers across multiple geographically distributed data centers of a major cloud provider. We group traffic based on public virtual IPs (VIPs) assigned to each cloud-hosted service. We identify network-based attacks using four key features: (1) significant traffic volume, (2) abnormal fan-in or fan-out, (3) abnormal packet header signatures, and (4) communication with Internet malicious hosts [37]. Using these features, we identified nine types of attacks, ranging from various DDoS attacks to application-level attacks such as SQL injection and spam.

Due to sampling in the NetFlow data and the lack of application-level information, our goal is not to identify all attacks but to understand their characteristics using low-overhead network-level information. We take a conservative approach to set attack detection thresholds to ensure that most detected attacks are real. We validate the detected attacks against alerts from deployed security appliances and incident reports written by operators. Our detected attacks cover 78.5% of the inbound attack alerts from DDoS protection appliances and 83.7% of the incident reports on outbound attacks.

Our broader goals are to (a) understand the key characteristics of these attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of existing DDoS mitigation approaches and (b) analyze their implications for building cloud-scale attack detection and mitigation solutions. Although many studies have focused on Internet attacks, this paper presents one of the first analyses of the key characteristics of attacks to and from the cloud based on a three-month dataset.

## 2. Datasets and Methodology

### 2.1 Cloud Provider Overview
The cloud network we studied comprises 10+ geographically distributed data centers across America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, connected to each other and the Internet via edge routers. Each data center hosts tens to hundreds of thousands of servers. The cloud provider hosts more than 10,000 services, including web, mobile, database, storage, and data analytics services. Each service is assigned a public virtual IP (VIP), and the traffic to the VIP is load-balanced across a group of virtual machines hosting the service, sometimes across multiple data centers.

Incoming traffic to different services first traverses the edge routers and then the commercial security appliances (e.g., Arbor [17]). These appliances analyze inbound traffic to protect against well-known attacks such as TCP SYN flood, UDP flood, ICMP flood, and TCP NULL attacks. However, they often miss low-volume attacks aimed at probing vulnerabilities, such as stealth port scans and application-level attacks like spam and SQL injection. To reduce false positives, traffic thresholds for alerting can be set either per tenant or across tenant groups.

Attackers can also abuse cloud resources to launch outbound attacks. They can compromise vulnerable VMs through brute-force attacks (e.g., password guessing) and use them for activities like YouTube click fraud, BitTorrent hosting, Bitcoin mining, spamming, malware propagation, or launching DDoS attacks. The cloud provider enforces several security mechanisms to mitigate outbound attacks, including limiting outbound bandwidth per VM, preventing IP spoofing, shutting down misbehaving VMs, and isolating anomalous traffic.

### 2.2 Dataset and Attack Detection Methodology
We obtained more than 200 TB of NetFlow logs from a major cloud provider over three months (May, November, and December 2013). The NetFlow logs had a 1 in 4096 packet sampling rate for both inbound and outbound traffic at the edge routers, aggregated over one-minute windows. Since the edge routers are located upstream of the security appliances, the attacks we detect are likely mitigated before reaching the VMs hosting services in the cloud. We analyzed the NetFlow data using Cosmos, a large scalable data storage system, and SCOPE, a programming framework similar to Map-Reduce.

We aggregated the NetFlow data by VIP in each one-minute window, studying both inbound and outbound traffic. For each VIP in each time window, we filtered the traffic based on protocol number, TCP flags, or port numbers. We then identified nine types of attacks listed in Table 1. Our attack detection is based on the following four network-level features:

- **Volume-based**: Many volume-based attacks try to exhaust server or infrastructure resources by sending a large volume of traffic. We capture volume-based attacks by identifying traffic with large relative spikes. We use sequential change point detection by comparing the traffic volume at the current time window with the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of the past 10 time windows. The difference is compared with a change threshold of 100 packets per minute in NetFlow, corresponding to an estimated value of about 7K pps in the original traffic.
- **Spread-based**: For many services, a single VIP typically connects to only a few Internet hosts in normal operation. If a VIP communicates with a large number of Internet hosts, it is likely an anomaly. We use the NetFlow data to compute the spread of a VIP (i.e., the number of distinct Internet IPs communicating with a VIP during a time window) for inbound and outbound traffic. We then capture the relative spikes of the spread using sequential change point detection.

| **Attack Type** | **Description** | **Net/App** | **Target** | **Detection Method** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|
| TCP SYN flood   | Send many TCP SYN packets to random or fixed ports on a server | Net | Server resources | Volume-based |
| UDP flood       | Send many UDP packets to random or fixed ports on a server | Net | Server resources | Volume-based |
| ICMP flood      | Send many ICMP packets to random or fixed ports on a server | Net | Server resources | Volume-based |
| DNS reflection  | A large number of DNS responses sent to a target from DNS servers (triggered by DNS requests with spoofed source addresses) | Net | Network bandwidth | Volume-based |
| Spam            | Launch email spam to multiple SMTP servers | App | Users | Spread-based |
| Brute-force     | Scan weak passwords or administrative control (using RDP, SSH, VNC) | App | Server vulnerability | Spread-based |
| SQL injection   | Send different SQL queries to exploit software vulnerabilities | App | SQL server vulnerability | Spread-based |
| Port scan       | Scan for open ports (using NULL, Xmas packets) | Net | Server vulnerability | Spread-based |
| Malicious web activity (TDS) | Communicate with hosts on malicious web infrastructure | App | Network features | Spread-based |

All traffic volume numbers in the paper are estimated volumes calculated based on the number in the NetFlow data and the sampling rate.
