User: I have installed both versions of python that is python 2.7 and python 3.5.3. When I run python command in command prompt, python 3.5.3 interpreter shows up. How can I switch to python 2.7 interpreter?
Assistant: In my case, /usr/bin/python is a symlink that points to /usr/bin/python2.7.
Ususally, there is a relevant symlink for python2 and python3.
So, if you type python2 you get a python-2 interpreter and if you type python3 you get a python-3 one.
