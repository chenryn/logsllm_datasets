## [ ]{#c05.xhtml#Page_104 .pagebreak title="104"} A Note on Recon APIs {#c05.xhtml#h1-501546c05-0007}
Many of the tools mentioned in this chapter have APIs that allow you to
integrate their services into your applications and scripts. We'll talk
about APIs more in [ Chapter 24 ]{.xref itemid="xref_target_Chapter 24"}
, but for now, you can think of APIs as endpoints you can use to query a
service's database. Using these APIs, you can query recon tools from
your script and add the results to your recon report without visiting
their sites manually.
本章提到的很多工具都有API，可以让你将它们的服务集成到你的应用和脚本中。我们会在第24章更深入地介绍API，但现在你可以将它们看作是你可以用来查询服务数据库的端点。使用这些API，你可以从你的脚本中查询反侦察工具，并将结果添加到你的反侦察报告中，而不需要手动访问它们的网站。
For example, Shodan has an API (
[https://developer.shodan.io/](https://developer.shodan.io/){.LinkURL}
*)* that allows you to query its database. You can access a host's scan
results by accessing this URL:
*https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/{ip}?key={YOUR_API_KEY}* . You could
configure your bash script to send requests to this URL and parse the
results *.* LinkedIn also has an API (
[https://www.linkedin.com/developers/](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/){.LinkURL}
) that lets you query its database. For example, you can use this URL to
access information about a user on LinkedIn:
*https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people/{PERSON ID}.* The Censys API (
[https://censys.io/api](https://censys.io/api){.LinkURL} ) allows you to
access certificates by querying the endpoint *https://censys.io/api/v1*
.
例如，Shodan具有API（https://developer.shodan.io/），可以让您查询其数据库。您可以通过访问此URL:
https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/{ip}?key={YOUR_API_KEY}来访问主机的扫描结果。您可以配置Bash脚本以向此URL发送请求并解析结果。
LinkedIn还具有API（https://www.linkedin.com/developers/），可让您查询其数据库。例如，您可以使用此URL来访问LinkedIn上用户的信息：https://api.linkedin.com/v2/people/{PERSON
ID}。 Censys
API（https://censys.io/api）允许您通过查询端点https://censys.io/api/v1来访问证书。
Other tools mentioned in this chapter, like BuiltWith, Google search,
and GitHub search, all have their own API services. These APIs can help
you discover assets and content more efficiently by integrating
third-party tools into your recon script. Note that most API services
require you to create an account on their website to obtain an *API key*
, which is how most API services authenticate their users. You can find
information about how to obtain the API keys of popular recon services
at
[https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng-marketplace/wiki/API-Keys/](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng-marketplace/wiki/API-Keys/){.LinkURL}
.
本章提到的其他工具，如BuiltWith、Google搜索和GitHub搜索，都有自己的API服务。
这些API可以通过将第三方工具集成到您的搜寻脚本中，帮助您更有效地发现资产和内容。请注意，大多数API服务都需要您在其网站上创建帐户以获取API密钥，这是大多数API服务对其用户进行身份验证的方式。您可以在https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng-marketplace/wiki/API-Keys/中找到有关如何获取流行搜寻服务API密钥的信息。
## Start Hacking! {#c05.xhtml#h1-501546c05-0008}
Now that you've conducted extensive reconnaissance, what should you do
with the data you've collected? Plan your attacks by using the
information you've gathered! Prioritize your tests based on the
functionality of the application and its technology.
既然你已经进行了广泛的侦察，那么你应该如何处理收集到的数据呢？利用你所收集的信息来规划攻击计划吧！根据应用程序的功能和技术优先安排测试。
For example, if you find a feature that processes credit card numbers,
you could first look for vulnerabilities that might leak the credit card
numbers, such as IDORs ( [ Chapter 10 ]{.xref
itemid="xref_target_Chapter 10"} ). Focus on sensitive features such as
credit cards and passwords, because these features are more likely to
contain critical vulnerabilities. During your recon, you should be able
to get a good idea of what the company cares about and the sensitive
data it's protecting. Go after those specific pieces of information
throughout your bug-hunting process to maximize the business impact of
the issues you discover. You can also focus your search on bugs or
vulnerabilities that affect that particular tech stack you uncovered, or
on elements of the source code you were able to find.
例如，如果您找到一个处理信用卡号码的功能，您可以首先寻找可能泄露信用卡号码的漏洞，比如IDOR（第10章）。专注于敏感特性，如信用卡和密码，因为这些特性更有可能包含关键漏洞。在您的侦查过程中，您应该能够了解公司关心什么以及它正在保护的敏感数据。在您的漏洞测试过程中，专注于这些特定的信息，以最大化您发现问题的业务影响。您还可以将搜索重点放在影响您发现的特定技术堆栈的漏洞或漏洞，或者源代码的某些元素上。
And don't forget, recon isn't a one-time activity. You should continue
to monitor your targets for changes. Organizations modify their system,
technologies, and codebase constantly, so continuous recon will ensure
that you always know what the attack surface looks like. Using a
combination of bash, scheduling tools, and alerting tools, build a recon
engine that does most of the work for you.
不要忘了，侦察不是一次性活动。您应该继续监视您的目标以便发现变化。组织会不断修改其系统、技术和代码库，所以持续性的侦察可以确保您始终知道攻击面的情况。使用一系列的bash、调度工具和警报工具，构建一个侦察引擎，它可以为您完成大部分工作。
## [ ]{#c05.xhtml#Page_105 .pagebreak title="105"} Tools Mentioned in This Chapter {#c05.xhtml#h1-501546c05-0009}
In this chapter, I introduced many tools you can use in your recon
process. Many more good tools are out there. The ones mentioned here are
merely my personal preferences. I've included them here in chronological
order for your reference.

### Tech Stack Fingerprinting {#c05.xhtml#h2-501546c05-0024}
1.  The CVE database (

    open sourced version-control system. You can use its
    `       git diff      ` command to keep track of file changes.
You should now have a solid understanding of how to conduct
reconnaissance on a target. Remember to keep extensive notes throughout
your recon process, as the information you collect can really balloon
over time. Once you have a solid understanding of how to conduct recon
on a target, you can try to leverage recon platforms like Nuclei (
[https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/){.LinkURL}
) or Intrigue Core (
[https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-core/](https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-core/){.LinkURL}
) to make your recon process more efficient. But when you're starting
out, I recommend that you do recon manually with individual tools or
write your own automated recon scripts to learn about the process.
现在你应该已经对如何对目标进行侦查有了深入的理解。记得在整个侦查过程中保持详细的笔记，因为你收集的信息可能会随着时间的推移而不断增加。一旦你对如何在目标上进行侦察有了牢固的理解，你可以尝试利用像
Nuclei（https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/）或 Intrigue
Core（https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-core/）这样的侦查平台，使你的侦察过程更加高效。但当你刚开始时，我建议你使用单个工具手动进行侦查，或编写自己的自动化侦查脚本以了解该过程。
