Question: "You are reviewing several function implementations in a codebase. For each function, determine whether it safely handles the conversion from signed to unsigned integers and avoids potential vulnerabilities. Select all that apply."
 "A": "A function that checks for negative return values from subroutines and converts them to error codes before returning as unsigned integers."
 "B": "A function that accepts signed integers for arithmetic operations without validating the range before casting to unsigned types for further processing."
 "C": "A function that uses a signed integer to determine the number of elements to allocate for an array, then casts it to size_t for the allocation without range checking."
 "D": "A function that explicitly casts signed integers to unsigned and performs boundary checks before using them in potentially unsafe operations such as memory allocation."
Answer: AD
