User: Based on the following information, please provide an elastic computing instance deployment plan to meet the business needs of the application system. 1. The application system is a web application program written in Java and needs to be deployed on the Tomcat web server. \n2. It is estimated that the number of visits per day is 1000. Each request needs to process a small amount of data, but it needs to interact frequently with the back-end database, so it requires high database read and write capabilities. \n3. The application system is required to respond to requests quickly to ensure efficient business operation and user response time within 60 seconds. At the same time, it is necessary to deal with the sudden growth of application traffic to ensure that the system has good elasticity and scalability. \nAssistant: Based on the above requirements, the following deployment solutions for elastic computing instances are recommended: 1. Deploy the Tomcat web server and write web applications in the Java language. 2. Configure the CPU and memory resources of the elastic computing instance to ensure that it can handle high-load traffic. 3. Deploy the database and use distributed database technology, such as MySQL or MongoDB, to avoid single point of failure and improve read and write capabilities. 4. Configure load balancing technology, such as Nginx or HAProxy, to distribute traffic and increase business availability and scalability. 5. Configure the auto-scaling function, such as using the automatic load distribution and elastic scaling functions provided by cloud service providers to dynamically increase or decrease server resources according to traffic changes. 6. Use monitoring and alerting tools for performance and error monitoring, and take necessary contingency measures to ensure that service failures are not affected by failures.
