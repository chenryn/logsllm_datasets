and, if available, measures the current temperature. The
pairs of MAC address and clock skew with the optional tem-
perature information represent the ﬁngerprints. A secured
channel to the TS can be established in two possible ways: 1.
If the UAP provides free access to the Internet, using its con-
nectivity, 2. If not possible (e. g., because access is bound to
providing credit card information before enabled) via a side
channel, e. g., 3G. Encryption and authenticity can be en-
sured by using well-known certiﬁcate-based standards such
as SSL. Note that a man-in-the-middle attack on this chan-
nel by the UAP can be mitigated by hard-coding the certiﬁ-
cate into the app. The client then sends the ﬁngerprint via
the secured channel to the TS. The TS decides, depending on
the information provided by the client, which of the diﬀer-
ent proposed methods for veriﬁcation (SVM/2AP-T/2AP)
to use and calculates its decision about the trustworthiness
(the verdict)—either binary or score-based. The verdict is
sent back to the client, enabling the user to decide whether
to use the UAP or not. All ﬁngerprints queried for veriﬁca-
tion are stored and integrated by the TS into its assessment.
The more users use the system, the broader is the base for
this assessment and, therefore, its precision. Thereby, APs
establish a reputation.
A legitimate replacement of an AP by the operator will
not cause any confusion: the new device will have a diﬀerent
MAC address and, hence, will be recognized as new AP in
that environment. Therefore, our crowdsourced approach
will automatically integrate this AP and begin to build its
reputation. Note that an attacker would also be able to
integrate his AP in this way. However, this would require
him to provide reliable long-term service to gain suﬃcient
reputation. The described approach could be implemented
without changing any standardized protocols and without
requiring the cooperation of network operators—instead, the
incentive for using this system is shifted to users who care
about their security. In future work we plan to implement
this architecture and test its eﬀectiveness in a real-world
scenario.
Finally, it would also be possible to store the trained mod-
els of the SVM for a favored set of APs in the app itself, as
the veriﬁcation of an environment against a trained SVM
model requires only low computational resources and the
models need only small storage capacities (the trained mod-
els in our experiments are around 2–32KB in size).

In this paper, we provide a practical solution to reliably
detect faked access points. This is done by passively esti-
mating the clock skew from information contained in man-
agement frames. We show a way to signiﬁcantly increase
its information content by considering its dependency on
temperature. Additionally, our method completely elimi-
nates the inﬂuence of the measuring device on the ﬁnger-
print. Hence, measurements performed by diﬀerent clients
become comparable. Interestingly, our method works even
without explicit access to temperature information and pro-
tects even against an attacker who selects a fake AP with a
similar average clock skew.
Our method exploits an intrinsic physical property that
provides the highest discriminability known so far of APs
using standard client hardware. The eﬀort for simulating
this property is much more complex than adjusting the av-
erage clock skew, even if hardware is modiﬁed. This renders
the attack practically infeasible.
Our approach yields a strong feature for passive remote
physical device ﬁngerprinting in wireless networks. Using
only 50 observations for training, our approach detects faked
access points in 90% of all cases.
No currently deployed protection mechanism for public
hotspots (e. g., web-based authentication) provides any secu-
rity against the described threat. With our proposed archi-
tecture it is possible to mitigate the danger without changing
deployed systems or the standard protocols used.
