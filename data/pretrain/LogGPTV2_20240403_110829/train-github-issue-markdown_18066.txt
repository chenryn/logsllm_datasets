Even as a developer with quite some experience with web development, I found
the HTMK5 and CSS3 waypoints interesting. However, this changed in the last 15
waypoints which covered just two topics: hex code and rgb values: with a lot
of repetition(e.g. three waypoints for how to change colour to red, blue and
green).
I think reducing the number of waypoints will be more productive to the user.
