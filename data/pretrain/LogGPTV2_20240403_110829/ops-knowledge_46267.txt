User: How do I get python to work with aptana studio?
I've downloaded a bunch of stuff, but none of them seem to give me a straight text editor where I can interpret code into an executable type thing. I know there's interactive mode in IDLE, but I want to actually use an editor. So I downloaded the pydev extensions for Aptana studio, but it wants me to configure a python interpreter (so I guess it actually doesn't have one). Where can I find a straight python interpreter that will work with this? or another IDE?
Assistant: To add the current Python version on Mac:

Add new interpreter via Aptana Studio 3/Preferences/PyDev/Interpreter-Python.
Give it name (check version using the Terminal and then python or /usr/bin/python.
Then add the path (2.7 in my case): /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python

If you install your own (2.6 in my case) use the following path instead:
 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python
Don't forget to hit the "Apply" button...
