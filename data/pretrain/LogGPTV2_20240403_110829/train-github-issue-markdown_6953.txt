Hi,
I used to have (with Symfony 2.6) parameters in app/config/config.yml in this
form :
    ...
    parameters:
        my-parameter: 123
I was able to access these using `ContainerInterface->getParameter('my-
parameter');`, however this now throws an InvalidArgumentException with the
message "The parameter "my-parameter" must be defined." starting from Symfony
2.7.  
There's no trace of this change in the change log nor in the UPGRADE-2.7.md
file, is this a bug or is this new behavior intended ?
Thanks.
