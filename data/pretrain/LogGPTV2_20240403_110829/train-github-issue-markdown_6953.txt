Subject: Issue with Accessing Parameters in Symfony 2.7

Hi,

I used to define parameters in the `app/config/config.yml` file in Symfony 2.6 as follows:

```yaml
parameters:
    my-parameter: 123
```

I was able to access these parameters using the `ContainerInterface->getParameter('my-parameter')` method. However, after upgrading to Symfony 2.7, this now throws an `InvalidArgumentException` with the message: "The parameter "my-parameter" must be defined."

I have not found any mention of this change in the changelog or the `UPGRADE-2.7.md` file. Could you please clarify whether this is a bug or if it is an intended new behavior?

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
