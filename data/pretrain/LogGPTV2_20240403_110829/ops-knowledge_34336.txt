User: Please list the main security issues that need to be considered in portal website development, and provide corresponding solutions.
Assistant: 1. Illegal access: Anyone can access the portal, so it is necessary to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access the site and restricted pages. Solution: Design and implement strong authentication and access control mechanisms, using two-factor authentication on portals to ensure that only authorized users can access sites and data. 2. Data Leakage: Portals contain a large amount of personal information, such as user passwords, mobile phone numbers, home addresses, credit card information, etc. Solution: Encrypt data on the portal, restrict physical access to servers, implement encryption during access and data transfer, and set up site-wide backups. 3. SQL injection: In portal websites, SQL queries are often used to perform database operations. Attackers can use this method to obtain sensitive data or compromise the integrity of data, resulting in data breaches or system crashes. Solution: Use precompiled statements or stored procedures to avoid passing client data as parameters to SQL query statements, thereby preventing SQL injection attacks. 4. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): An XSS attack refers to an attacker injecting malicious scripts on a webpage, and these scripts are executed when users browse the webpage, resulting in the leakage of sensitive data or other malicious behaviors. Solution: filter the input data, implement output escaping, use HTTP only for cookie setting, and use secure HTTP headers to prevent XSS attacks. 5. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack: CSRF attack is that the attacker uses the user to perform malicious operations in the logged-in state. The attacker uses the obtained user login status to force operations on the back-end server, jeopardizing the normal operation of the back-end system. Solution: Use CSRF tokens to ensure each user is unique when submitting the form. 6. Code Injection: Applications on the portal may have code injection issues, which can be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code or commands. Solution: Limit file uploads on the portal, ensure all incoming data is filtered and avoid executing any unauthenticated code. 7. Authentication and authorization bypass: Attackers may attempt to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms in order to access unauthorized resources. Solution: Adopt a strict authentication and authorization mechanism, requiring users to provide correct user names and passwords, as well as other authentication information. Restrict users' access rights and prohibit users from accessing any restricted resources without authorization. 8. Session hijacking: An attacker hijacks a user's session to obtain sensitive information, perform malicious operations, or log in to the system by pretending to be a user. Solution: Use encrypted communication, apply encryption technology on both the client and server to effectively prevent data from being eavesdropped by communication; use HTTP only to set cookies to ensure that cookies can only be transmitted by the browser and prevent cookie theft occur.
