Not sure if it's an intended behavior, anyway it seems that Angular2 doesn't
assign the active state (the "router-link-active" class) to a routerLink
element when its corresponding route contains query string params.  
You can reproduce this situation with the official routing example itself:  
https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/router/ts/plnkr.html
  * Click on "heroes" to step in the Horoes list view (note how the active class has been correctly assigned to the Heroes anchor element in the navbar)
  * Choose one from the list ( the new route removes the active state from the heroes link)
  * Click on the back button
  * You're back in the hero list view, but the Heroes anchor element hasn't been given the router-link-active class in the navbar
The last click triggers the following:  
this._router.navigate(['Heroes', {id: heroId, foo: 'foo'} ]);
As stated in the doc "Unfortunately, the browser address bar does not change
when running the live example in plunker." anyway "The id value appears in the
query string (?id=15&foo=foo), not in the URL path. The path for the "Heroes"
route doesn't have an :id token."
