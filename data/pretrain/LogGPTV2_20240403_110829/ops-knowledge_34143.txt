User: I spent the past couple of days trying to get opencv to work with my Python 2.7 install. I kept getting an error saying that opencv module was not found whenever I try "import cv".
I then decided to try installing opencv using Macports, but that didn't work.
Next, I tried Homebrew, but that didn't work either.
Eventually, I discovered I should modify the PYTHONPATH as such:
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH"
My problem is that I didn't find /usr/local/lib/python2.*...etc
The folder simply doesn't exist
So my question is this:
How do I properly install Python on OS X Snow Leopard for it to work with opencv? 
Thanks a lot,
Assistant: You need to install the module using your python2.7 installation. Pointing your PYTHONPATH at stuff installed under 2.6 to run under 2.7 is a Bad Idea. 
Depending on how you want to install it, do something like python2.7 setup.py or easy_install-2.7 opencv to install.
fwiw, on OS X the modules are usually installed under /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ but you should almost never need to know where anything installed in your site packages is physically located; if Python can't find them without help you've installed them wrong.
