User: I spent hours yesterday trying to get the blapi up and running and finally gave in and emailed their support, this is the response:

"Unfortunately our BLPAPI SDKs are not compatible with the Anaconda
  distribution of Python. That Python is built using GCC, and it is not
  capable of loading DLLs that were built using Microsoft Visual Studio;
  our DLLS were built with MSVS.
This means you'll need to use the Python distribution from Python.org,
  which is also built with MSVS."

I cannot download the normal Python (from Python.org) due to security constraints, but for some reason I can do Anaconda.  Honestly it's preferable for me anyhow because I don't want to mess with having to download 15 diff packages I need afterwards.
Does anybody have any idea if it is even possible to work around this?  It seems ridiculous that Bloomberg would force you to use the straight distribution and then have to go download all the packages you want individually by making this incompatible with GCC builds.
Assistant: This is not true. The Anaconda Python and Python extension modules are built using Visual Studio (2008 for Python 2 and 2010 for Python 3, the same as the Python installers from python.org).
