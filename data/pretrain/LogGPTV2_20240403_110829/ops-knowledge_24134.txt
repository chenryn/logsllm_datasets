User: Please describe the difference between a relational database and a non-relational database, and which type of database should be selected in different scenarios.
Assistant: The main difference between a relational database (RDBMS) and a non-relational database (NoSQL) lies in the way data is stored and queried. The relational database is stored in the form of a table, and the SQL language is used for data query and operation, which can ensure the consistency and integrity of the data. Relational databases are suitable for scenarios that require high consistency and a large number of transaction processing, such as financial systems and e-commerce systems. Non-relational databases have no fixed table structure and use key-value pairs or documents to store data. Common ones include document databases, key-value databases, and columnar storage databases. Non-relational databases are highly scalable and high-performance, and are suitable for scenarios that require high-throughput and low-latency queries, such as social networks and the Internet of Things. Therefore, when choosing a database type, you need to consider specific application scenarios and requirements. For scenarios that require high consistency and transaction processing, you should try to choose a relational database. For scenarios that require high performance and scalability, you can choose a non-relational database. database.
