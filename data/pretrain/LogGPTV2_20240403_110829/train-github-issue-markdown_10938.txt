If the viewport is smaller than the list of dropdown links of a fixed-top
navbar, there is no way to scroll down to view links that are beyond my view.
The reason being obviously that the entire navbar is "fixed". I've tried to
make .navbar-collapse scrollable but it won't always scroll down to the very
end, it's very confusing.
Can be reproduced using your example here:
http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar-fixed-top/, both on mobile and
desktop. I'm using the newest Chrome Browser.
Any thoughts on this are VERY MUCH appreciated - thanks!
