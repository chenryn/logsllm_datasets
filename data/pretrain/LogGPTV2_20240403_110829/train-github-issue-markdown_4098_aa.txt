##### Detailed description
After I install OpenCV with OpenCV-contrib from source, I got the following
error when I try to import OpenCV:

I just finish the compilation without error using:  
`cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \ -D
INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \ -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \ -D WITH_CUDA=OFF \ -D
ENABLE_FAST_MATH=1 \ -D CUDA_FAST_MATH=1 \ -D WITH_CUBLAS=1 \ -D
BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \ -D
OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib-3.4.3/modules .. `  
I first tried with CUDA, but because of errors in connection with the version
of gcc (NVCC needs version  7 because of the
error "-Wimplicit-fallthrough = 3 "unrecognized at 2% compilation). I finally
did the compilation without CUDA and I had no compilation error.
I find that other people who have errors like this have had it with
Mathematica or Draftsight (for example). **However, I do not know how to fix
this in the case of OpenCV.**
Note that I successfully compiled OpenCV (without CUDA and OpenCV_contrib)
yesterday with the same compilation options.
For information, that was the information I get from cmake before compiling.
We can see than "freetype2" was correctly identified (even if it seem that it
could be the cause of the problem according to some forum of similar trouble
on Mathematica)
