User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to detect if files were saved or copied to a USB drive? How can I find out if files from my computer were written/copied/moved to a USB storage device? I want to know if there is a solution that would work in a system that has not got any monitoring/logging of USB activity explicitly enabled and after the files have already been written.

I have already used software which would reads the information from registry location 


  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR


But it just tells the vendor name, time connected and other artifacts.

Assistant: This will depend entirely on what logging you have enabled. It it's easy after the event to tell you to log all file copies etc, but if you weren't logging it, you won't be able to retrieve that info.
