ABSTRACT 
The  usability  of  graphical  passwords  based  upon  recognition  of 
images  is  widely  explored.  However,  it  is  likely  that  their 
observed high memorability is contingent on certain attributes of 
the image sets presented to users. Characterizing this relationship 
remains an open problem; for example, there is no systematic (and 
empirically verified) method to determine how similarity between 
the  elements  of  an  image  set  impacts  the  usability  of  the  login 
challenge.  Strategies  to  assemble  suitable  images  are  usually 
carried  out  by  hand,  which  represents  a  significant  barrier  to 
uptake  as  the  process  has  usability  and  security  implications.  In 
this  paper,  we  explore  the  role  of  simple  image  processing 
techniques  to  provide  automated  assembly  of  usable  login 
challenges 
recognition-based  graphical 
passwords. We firstly carry out a user study to obtain a similarity 
ranked image set, and use the results to select an optimal per-pixel 
image  similarity  metric.  Then  we  conduct  a  short-term  image 
recall  test  using  Amazon  Mechanical  Turk  with  343  subjects 
where we manipulated the similarity present in image grids. In the 
most  significant  case,  we  found  that  our  automated  methods  to 
choose decoy images could impact the login success rate by 40%, 
and the median login duration by 35 seconds.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Users  of  alphanumeric  passwords  are  widely  known  to  choose 
credentials  that  are  sufficiently  predictable  to  undermine  their 
principal  security  benefits  [17].  This  has  led  to  the  proposal  of 
strategies  of  password  selection  designed  to  mitigate  such 
predictability such as passphrases and mnemonics [19]. However, 
the  success  of  these  strategies,  relies  upon  their  adoption  by 
conscientious users, and the strategies themselves may even

contribute to user choice biases of their own. Graphical passwords 
[2][36]  based  upon  the  recognition  of  previously  seen  images 
have  been  proposed  and  evaluated  in  order  to  ascertain  their 
suitability  as  a  viable  alternative  to  passwords  and  Personal 
Identification  Numbers  (PINs).  Systems  have  been  empirically 
evaluated with a password space ranging from 11 bits [13] to over 
50  bits  [40],  and  results  highlight  promising  usability.  The 
principal  benefit  of  such  systems  is  thought  to  be  that  users  are 
more  likely  to  remember  assigned  authentication  credentials, 
thereby eliminating issues relating to predictable user choice. This 
genre of system provides a simple user interaction, as users must 
perform  a  visual  search  to  identify  previously  assigned  images 
(key images) amongst decoy images. The sequence of key images 
comprises  the  graphical  password.  Systems  initialized  using 
personal images [26,37,38] are particularly promising due to the 
ubiquity  of  large  image  collections,  in  addition  due  to  observed 
usability benefits where users have had involvement to capture or 
create the images [28].  
However, it appears likely that the usability benefits of this genre 
of graphical password are contingent upon subtle attributes of the 
image sets that are presented to users.  For instance, it has been 
noted  that  visual  and  semantic  similarity  exhibited  between 
images  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  picture  superiority effect 
[32] by causing errors in visual search [7] and rote learning [34]. 
For security and simplicity, it would be desirable that image sets 
are  assembled  randomly;  however,  the  constraints  that  clearly 
exist  when  creating  a  usable  login  challenge  imply  that  some 
degree of skill and effort is required to do this effectively, and in a 
manner  that  preserves  security.  Figure  1  illustrates  different 
extremes of assembling decoy images for a particular key image. 
Zurko  and  Simon  [43]  remind  us  that  user-centered  security 
should  be  proportioned  between  end-  users,  developers  and 
system  administrators.  Currently  such  a  holistic  consideration  is 
lacking, as there is currently no systematic or empirically verified 
convention to reason over the similarity in an image set, and as a 
result this

process must be performed by hand on the basis of common sense 
judgments  of  image  semantics  [1].  Users  themselves  could  be 
asked to tag for similarity, but this can present security threats if 
users  attempt  to  circumvent  the  process  to  obtain  an  overly 
simplistic login task (e.g. Figure 1, right image). This absence of a 
systematic means to evaluate image similarity, combined with the 
potential 
levels  of  similarity  on 
authentication  error  rates,  constitutes  a  significant  barrier  to  the 
real world deployment of graphical passwords. Indeed, the ability 
to spontaneously generate usable image sets likely could present 
security benefits in terms of guessabilty, phishing and observation 
attack,  and  becomes  more  pressing  when  considering  likely 
deployment level phenomena such as password resets, where new 
image  sets  would  need  to  be  generated  in  response  to  user 
demand.    
An as-yet unexplored approach to solve this problem is to harness 
image processing research from the field of content-based image 
retrieval (CBIR) [12]. One fundamental challenge is to determine 
whether  two  images  are  similar.  In  this  field  the  underlying 
assumption  is  that  images  with  similar  visual  characteristics  are 
more likely to be semantically similar [39]. Our contribution is to 
explore the efficacy of a systematic method to identify instances 
of visual similarity between images, and explore the impact of its 
careful  manipulation  upon  the  usability  and  security  of  images 
presented  in  a  graphical  password  login.  We  carry  out  two  user 
studies: firstly we gain a human consensus on the visual similarity 
within an image set, and use those results to identify a mechanism 
to  detect  digital  image  similarity  that  can  best  represent  our 
collected  human  consensus.  Then,  in  a  second  study  we use the 
most promising method to generate graphical password logins for 
a user study conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The study 
captured participant performance in a short-term recall task where 
the  visual  similarity  present  in  the  login  was  manipulated  to 
differing degrees. Finally, we consider the security implications of 
systematic  filtering,  identify  attacks  that  can  result,  and  propose 
countermeasures.  
2.  RELATED WORK 
2.1  Graphical Passwords 
Recognition-based  graphical  passwords  [36][2]  have  received 
increasing  research  attention  due  to  experimental  results  in 
cognitive  psychology  that  suggest  the  existence  of  a  picture 
superiority effect [32]: that images are retained in memory better 
than words or numbers. This has led to a number of instantiations 
of  user  authentication  systems  that  aim  to  harness  this  effect. 
Passfaces  [25]  harnesses  human  ability  to  recognize  faces.  In  a 
field  study  across  three  months,  it  was  discovered  that  users  of 
this  system  made  one  third  of  the  errors  made  by  those  using 
traditional  passwords  [4].  Findings  from  the  field  suggest  that 
asking users to remember a specific ordering of the images causes 
errors [1][18], that the rate at which users are introduced to new 
systems  can  impact  retention  [10],  and  that  the  memorability  of 
images  increases  the  more  involvement  the  user  has  in  their 
creation  [28].  Tullis  and  Tedesco  [38]  performed  a  series  of 
studies  on  a  photograph-based  system  and  found  users  to 
accurately 
recognize  personal  photographs  amongst  stock 
photographs,  even  when  stock  photographs were hand-picked to 
be  semantically  similar  to  their  own  images.  The  same  authors 
also  reported  impressive  user  recall  performance  six  years  after 
the initial study[37].    
Image processing is beginning to play a role in the usability and 
security  of  graphical  passwords.  Dirik  et  al.  [6]  proposed image 
processing  techniques  that  could  serve  to  predict  user  choice  in 
the Passpoints [41] system. Focusing upon two particular images, 
they  performed  object  segmentation,  calculated  probabilities  for 
the  objects  users  would  likely  focus  their  attention  upon,  and 
calculated  the  centroids  of  those  objects  to  serve  as  candidate 
click  points.    By  doing  so  they  were  able  to  guess  80%  of  user 
click points they collected in a user study. Salehi-Abari et al. [31] 
developed these ideas further and used corner detection to identify 
candidate  click  points,  and  optimized  their  guessing  strategy 
according to techniques likely to be adopted by users in graphical 
password  selection.  They  assembled  a  34.7  bit  attack  dictionary 
and were able to guess (depending on the image) 48% to 54% of 
entire  click  point  sequences.  Dynahand  [27]  considered  the 
problem of eliminating visual similarity from image sets where the 
image stimuli took the form of freehand doodles.  
2.2   Similarity and Visual Search 
There are a range of definitions of similarity. Medin [22] suggests 
that: "Similarity between two things increases as a function of the 
number  of  features  or  properties  they  share  and  decreases as a 
function of mismatching or distinctive features”. Smith et al. [34] 
used  the  Farnsworth-Munsell  100  Hue  test  in  a  paired  associate 
learning  context  to  explore  the  impact  of  visual  similarity  upon 
rote  learning.  Here,  colors  with  different  controlled  levels  of 
similarity  were  assigned  textual  tags  and  participants  were 
challenged  to  recall  the  tag  when  presented  with  a  color.  They 
found that when stimuli were similar, the performance scores for 
recall  were  worse  and  suggest  that  rote  learning  decreases  as  a 
function of the number of stimuli relevant for a particular textual 
tag. In the field of visual search, what we refer to as key images 
are referred to as target images, and decoys are referred to as non-
targets.  Duncan  and  Humphreys  [7]  explored  the  efficiency  of 
visual  search  when  using  alphabetic  characters  and  hand 
manipulating  the  choice  of  distracters  to  varying  degrees  of 
similarity. They concluded that there exist two types of similarity: 
within-object  conjunctions:  where  the  spatial  arrangement  of 
strokes is similar (e.g. L vs. T); across-object conjunctions: where 
the  target  can  be  formed  by  recombining  strokes  from  different 
non-targets (e.g. find R amongst a set of P and Q characters). In 
addition, they identify interesting properties of visual search: that 
it  takes  longer  to  decide  that  a  target  is  absent  than  to  say  it  is 
present, and that target images can be camouflaged if placed next 
to similar non-targets. 
2.3  Digital Image Processing 
The most common way to compare digital images for similarity is 
to create and store signatures of an image that represent particular 
features  e.g.  color,  and  compute  distances  between 
these 
signatures.  Choosing  the  most  appropriate  image  signature  is  a 
context  specific  task.  Color  is  the  most  widely  used  attribute  in 
image  retrieval  and  object  recognition  [20].  The  SIMPLIicity 
system [39] attempts to systematically categorize the image type 
before  choosing  the  most  appropriate  feature  representation. 
Histogram-based  methods  are  widely studied and are considered 
to  be  effective.  Rubner  et  al.  [29]  propose  the  use  of  the  Earth 
Mover's Distance  (EMD)  as  a  method  for  calculating  a  distance 
between  two  color  histograms  for  purposes  of  determining  their 
similarity.  This  reﬂects  the  minimal  cost  of  transforming  one 
distribution into another. Lv et al. [21] explore using a modified 
version  of  the  EMD  for  similarity  matching  and  propose  the 
average  precision  metric.  Pass  and  Zabih  [24]  suggest  adding 
multiple dimensions to histograms to include characteristics other 
100
than pure color, such as spatial information. Selection of the most 
appropriate  color  space  can  also  be  an  important  decision,  as 
some  are  more  perceptually  linear  than  others  and  so  lend 
themselves better to reasoning over image similarity [11]. 
3.  IMAGE FILTERING AND GRAPHICAL 
PASSWORDS 
We  firstly  define  some  terms:  the  image  set  comprises  all  the 
images available to the authentication system; the login challenge 
is  a  subset  of  the  image  set,  which  is  comprised  of  both  key 
images  and  decoy  images  and  is  presented  to  the  user  at  login.  
There are a number of conventions regarding the presentation of 
the login challenge to users, however for simplicity we constrain 
our discussion to the mode where the login challenge is displayed 
across a sequence of grids, and where one key image is certain to 
appear in each grid. Image filtering is the process of reducing an 
image set into a login challenge through a process of choosing key 
images and their associated decoy images.  
The absence of an accepted automated process to perform image 
filtering has likely, in part, motivated recent research pursuing the 
identification  of  an  optimal  image  type  for  recognition-based 
graphical passwords [15] (see Table 1). This optimal image type 
is intuitively one that minimizes the burden placed upon a person 
to  undergo  the  process  of  image  filtering  by  hand,  and  one  that 
allows  users  to  perform  favorably  in  recall  tests  with  the  login 
challenges assembled using that process. The drive to satisfy both 
constraints  has  led  to  a  focus  upon  particularly  contrived  image
