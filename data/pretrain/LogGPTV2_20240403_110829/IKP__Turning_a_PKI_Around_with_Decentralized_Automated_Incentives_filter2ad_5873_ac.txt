certiﬁcate issuances during the lifetime of the RP.
2) Policy-adherence. An RP should be bound to a speciﬁc
policy for a domain. In particular, since a DCP may change
over time, an RP should represent a reaction to violations of
a speciﬁc version of a domain’s DCP. Binding an RP to a
speciﬁc DCP version ensures consistency between the criteria
for certiﬁcate authorization and the reaction to the violation of
those criteria. This principle also implies that a domain must
have a DCP before obtaining an RP.
3) Single-use. An RP should be limited to a single instance of
CA misbehavior. Because RPs may execute ﬁnancial payments

for which funds must be available, enforcing single-use RPs
helps ensure the availability of such one-time resources for
each instance of misbehavior. Single-use RPs also prevent ad-
versaries colluding with domains or detectors from repeatedly
triggering an RP to obtain payouts. Thus each time a CA issues
a certiﬁcate that violates a domain’s DCP, one of the domain’s
RPs is triggered and then terminated. We note that domains can
have multiple RPs at a given time to protect against multiple
instances of CA misbehavior. However, we anticipate that in
the vast majority of cases, a domain will only have a single
RP at a given time.
B. RP Contents
We now describe the contents and format of RPs. Figure 4
shows the format of a sample RP, and Table III describes
each ﬁeld of an RP. Like a DCP, an RP contains identifying
information for the domain as well as for the issuing CA. An
RP also speciﬁes a validity period and identiﬁes the version of
the domain’s DCP for which it is active. Finally, the reactions
that take place are speciﬁed as an address to a contract.
A reaction program contains code that can be executed by
the IKP authority when a certiﬁcate meeting certain criteria
is reported and the relevant domain’s checker program deems
the certiﬁcate to be unauthorized. As described in Section V-C,
we expect reaction programs to execute ﬁnancial transactions.
After a reaction to CA misbehavior is triggered via a reaction
program, the RP containing the reaction program is destroyed.
A reaction program deﬁnes the following three methods:
1) trigger, which executes when an unauthorized certiﬁcate
is reported for the domain named in the RP, 2) terminate,
which executes upon request from a domain whose CA issued

an unauthorized certiﬁcate, and 3) expire, which executes
upon request from a CA after the RP has expired.
We note that an RP has a start and end time for its
validity, rather than only a start time as a DCP does. An
RP, like a certiﬁcate, has a limited validity period, but can
be prematurely terminated if the issuing CA misbehaves. If
an RP is terminated for any reason, the speciﬁed amount of
funds is split between the domain and the issuing CA based
on the fraction of the RP’s validity period that has passed. The
exact payouts are detailed below.
to the IKP contract. The payout provides an incentive for
entities to monitor CA operations in search of unauthorized
certiﬁcates. Domains can negotiate their own detection reward;
high-proﬁle domains may choose to specify a higher detection
payout than domains for which security is less important.
The RP speciﬁes the detection payout for misbehavior by
a registered CA. If a detector reports misbehavior by an
unregistered CA, the detector instead receives a smaller payout
amount m. This reduced payout deters a collusion attack that
we describe in Section VI.
C. Payout Reaction Programs
D. RP Operations
We now provide a framework for payout reaction programs,
which specify a series of ﬁnancial payments that execute in
response to CA misbehavior. Financial payments are important
to achieving incentivization, since ﬁnancial payments be quan-
tiﬁed and analyzed. Our goal in designing a framework for this
class of reaction programs is to provide a general model for
who should receive payments under different circumstances of
misbehavior.
We identify three relevant parties who may receive pay-
ments if a method from a payout reaction program is executed:
1) the domain, which we denote by D, 2) the certiﬁcate-
issuing CA, which we denote by C, and 3) the detector,
which we denote by d. As Figure 4 shows, a payout reaction
program speciﬁes three payouts: affected-domain payouts,
termination payouts, and detection payouts. To ensure that the
IKP authority has a sufﬁcient balance for these payouts, an
amount E is sent to the global fund when the RP is issued.
Affected-domain payouts. The affected-domain payout (writ-
ten a) is paid to domain D in the event that a registered CA
issues an unauthorized certiﬁcate in D’s name. The payout
compensates D for the security risk it
incurs by having
an unauthorized certiﬁcate that could be used in a MitM
attack. The domain does not receive this payout in case of
misbehavior by an unregistered CA.
Termination payouts. The termination payout (written t) is
split between domain D and CA C if D terminates the RP.
The termination payout compensates D for lost trust in C
after its misbehavior and contributes to the costs of obtaining
a new certiﬁcate and/or RP. The split of the termination payout
between D and C is proportional to the amount of time left
in the RP’s validity. To ensure that D receives some minimum
amount of funds, we set a systemwide parameter τ that D is
guaranteed to receive. Letting α ≤ 1 denote the fraction of
the RP’s remaining validity, we then have
tD = α · (t − τ ) + τ
(1)
Because 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, we see that tD is bounded by
τ ≤ tD ≤ t
(2)
We note that although C does receive funds from the termina-
tion payout in spite of its misbehavior, we show in Section VI
that C loses funds compared to if it had behaved correctly.
Detection payouts. The detection payout (written δ) is the
amount paid to whomever reports an unauthorized certiﬁcate
We now describe relevant operations for an RP issued in
IKP. Speciﬁcally, we cover RP issuance as well as the sce-
narios in which each of the reaction program’s three methods
(trigger, terminate, and expire) are executed.
RP issuance. When a domain D wants to purchase an RP
from a CA C registered in IKP, the two parties ﬁrst agree on
the terms of the RP or certiﬁcate out of band. In particular,
for an RP with a payout reaction contract, D and C negotiate
the payouts a t, and δ, as well as the price ρ of the RP. IKP
sets two constraints on the amounts that must hold:
t < ρ < a + τ
m < δ
(3)
(4)
These constraints are justiﬁed in Section VI.
Once C and D have agreed on the terms of the RP, we must
ensure that a domain who purchases an RP in IKP obtains what
it agreed on with the CA, and conversely, that the CA receives
the appropriate payment for the RP that it has issued. We can
achieve such a fair exchange by having the IKP authority act
as a third-party escrow.
Speciﬁcally, D sends the payment for the RP or certiﬁcate to
the IKP authority, along with the hash of the RP or certiﬁcate
and C. In turn, C creates and sends the RP or certiﬁcate to
the IKP authority. To ensure that the IKP authority has enough
funds to pay out the appropriate parties, C may also need to
send additional funds to the IKP authority (see Section VIII).
The IKP authority then veriﬁes that 1) the RP or certiﬁcate
hashes to the value provided by D, 2) the amount of funds
that C has sent over (if necessary) is sufﬁcient to ensure that
the global fund will be able to send the payouts in case of
misbehavior, and 3) the terms of the RP meet the constraints
described above. If any of these criteria do not hold, then the
domain’s fee ρ is returned and the issuance is canceled. If all
of these criteria hold, ρ is transferred to C and any funds sent
with C’s message are transferred to the global fund.
Domain RP selection. The IKP authority maintains a mapping
between domains and a list of their currently-active RPs. When
a domain purchases a new RP, the IKP authority adds the new
RP to the domain’s corresponding list ordered by the validity
ending time. When misbehavior is reported, the IKP authority
triggers the appropriate reaction in the ﬁrst policy in the list.
This scheme ensures an unambiguous reaction to an instance
of CA misbehavior while also triggering the RP that expires
the soonest.

RP trigger. If C is found to have issued an unauthorized
certiﬁcate for a domain D, then the trigger method of D’s
RP is automatically executed. For payout reaction programs, D
receives the affected-domain payout a and its share termination
payout tD, the detector receives the detection payout δ, and
C receives its share of the termination payout t − tD. The
IKP authority then removes the RP from the list of D’s RPs.
The IKP authority also records the time at which a detector
reported misbehavior by C to handle the termination case
below.
RP termination. If C is found to have misbehaved, any
domain D that has an RP issued by C can prematurely
terminate the RP. To do so, D sends a message to the IKP
authority with the RP it wishes to terminate. The IKP authority
checks that the RP’s validity began before C’s last misbehavior
and that the RP has not yet expired, and if so, executes the
terminate method. In this case, D receives its share of the
termination payout tD and C receives its share t − tD.
RP expiration. Once the validity period for an RP belonging
to a domain D has ended, the IKP authority simply removes
the RP from the list of D’s RPs. Because doing so can reduce
the liability of the issuing CA C, the IKP may also note the
reduction in liability and return funds as necessary to C’s
payment account.
VI. ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze the design of IKP. In particular,
we model the incentives of each entity in the IKP ecosystem
by considering the ﬂow of payments among entities for
each operation (such as RP issuance). Using this model, we
demonstrate two important guarantees that hold in IKP:
1) Incentives for DCP compliance and misbehavior report-
ing: issuing a certiﬁcate that complies with a domain’s
DCP or reporting a certiﬁcate that violates a domain’s
DCP results in a higher payout than alternative actions.
2) Disincentives against misbehavior and collusion attacks:
falsely reporting a valid certiﬁcate as unauthorized or
issuing a certiﬁcate that violates a domain’s DCP does
not result
in a proﬁt for a misbehaving detector or
CA, respectively, regardless of who the detector or CA
colludes with.
In the course of our analysis, we derive constraints on RP
terms that must hold for the above properties to be true.
A. Model
We begin by analyzing the payments that occur within the
model described by the constraints in the previous sections.
Table IV summarizes the payout amounts for each action in
IKP. For most of our analysis we consider a single RP lifetime
and certiﬁcate issuance, and use the following notation:
• D denotes the domain for whom a (possibly unautho-
rized) certiﬁcate is issued,
• R denotes the CA that issues the RP to D,
• C denotes the CA that issues the certiﬁcate to D,
• d denotes a detector who can choose whether or not to
report the certiﬁcate as unauthorized, and
