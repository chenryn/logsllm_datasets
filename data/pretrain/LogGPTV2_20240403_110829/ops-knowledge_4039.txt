User: Is there a way to set up CherryPy to use SSL when running behind Apache2 without configuring Apache2 to do SSL for CherryPy?
I have found multiple tutorials about using SSL with CherryPy and configuring Apache2 to do the SSL work for CherryPy, but I have not been able to find a tutorial that deals with using SSL with CherryPy behind Apache2 without configuring Apache2 to do the SSL work.
Assistant: You cannot do that (nor would I try to). Firstly, Apache will be better for terminating the SSL than CherryPy (if for no other reason, than performance). And secondly, it will simply not work because Apache speaks HTTP and HTTPS is actually HTTP encrypted with SSL, so you need to handle the SSL before you get any HTTP that Apache can understand.
