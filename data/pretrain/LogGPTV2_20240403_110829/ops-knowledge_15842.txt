User: I want to use UniCurses on Windows. For this, I downloaded various ZIP-archives. I downloaded pdc34dll.zip, pdc34dlls.zip, pdc34dllu.zip, pdc34dllw.zip and pdcurses34.zip. The last was just the source.
I tried to place the files within the pdc34dll-folder, extracted from pdc34dll.zip, to the main directory of the Python 3.5.2 installation folder, to the directory where Unicurses is installed (C:\programming\python\352.lib.site-packages\unicurses) and in the System32-directory (C:\windows\system32).
But I still get the message that pdcurses.dll cannot be found.
What do I wrong and what should I do to solve this problem properly?
Thanks for the help.
Assistant: This is impossible, because it was a build for Python 3.4!
