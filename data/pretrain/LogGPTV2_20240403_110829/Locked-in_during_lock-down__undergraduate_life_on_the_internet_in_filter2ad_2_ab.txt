for international and domestic post-shutdown users. We
consider mobile and desktop devices separately from unclas-
sified devices, and exclude IoT devices here.
pandemic. Moreover, we suspect these students to have different
patterns of Internet usage compared to their domestic peers, so we
seek to separate the two classes of users.
Due to privacy concerns, we do not have ground truth regarding
which devices in our dataset are owned by international students.
Instead, we identify (likely) international students based on their
network traffic. First we collect the geolocation data for every
IP address that was visited by a post-shutdown user during the
month of February, excluding CDNs (Akamai, AWS, Cloudfront, and
Optimizely). We exclude these CDNs because they give information
about the user’s device location, but not the location of the sites the
user is visiting. Then, for each device, we calculate the geographic
midpoint of the destination of each of that device’s connections
during the month of February. We weight each connection by its
number of bytes and then translate this weighted midpoint into
geographic coordinates; if a user’s midpoint falls outside the borders
of the United States, we classify them as an international student.
Our method of classifying international students is conservative
because an international student’s weighted midpoint may fall in a
different part of the country if they visit a mix of domestic and for-
eign servers. However, this approach still allows us to identify stu-
dents who were primarily visiting foreign websites. This approach
identifies 1,022 devices presumed to be used by international stu-
dents, which constitutes 18% of all identified post-shutdown users.
In the Fall before the pandemic, reports indicated that about 25% of
the entire student body population at UC San Diego was comprised
of International students [14], however there are no reports of how
many students who remained on campus during the lock-down
were domestic or international students.
Given this labeling of foreign and domestic students, we compare
their Internet usage by plotting the median volume of traffic per
device in Figure 4. In this graph, we exclude Zoom (the tool used
for online classes) traffic as it is both large (c.f. Figure 5) and not
significantly different between populations. The biggest difference
between these two user groups is during academic break, when the

users from February through May 2020.
volume of traffic increases for international students but remains
stable for domestic students. The volume of traffic also stays ele-
vated for international students for the duration of the term relative
to their domestic counterparts.
5 APPLICATION USAGE
Here we consider usage of both work and leisure applications.
5.1 Online classes
When classes at the university transitioned fully online, they were
primarily hosted on the video conference platform Zoom. Other
universities, companies, and social events also moved to Zoom,
resulting in over 300 million daily meeting participants as of April
2020 [19]. To analyze Zoom traffic in our dataset, we identify all
connections that resolve to a zoom.us domain. We also analyze
connections where an IP address matches a list of IP addresses from
Zoom support [18], and use the Internet Archive Wayback Machine
to find any IP addresses that were previously listed on this page,
but were subsequently removed.
We plot the aggregate Zoom traffic in Figure 5. While the overall
Zoom traffic increased, there are periodic dips that occur during
the weekends. The weekday traffic is most active from 8am to 6pm
on weekdays, which corresponds to online classes. On weekends,
there is a small spike in traffic in the afternoon (not shown), which
may indicate that people are using Zoom for entertainment (e.g.
calls with family and friends) or for extracurricular activities (e.g.
club meetings).
5.2 Social media
As people had to stay indoors during the pandemic, the popularity
of some social media sites has increased dramatically. Notably,
TikTok’s popularity increased by 75% from January to September
2020 [9]. In this section, we study the changes in social media
usage throughout the COVID-19 shutdown. We focus on Facebook,
Instagram, and TikTok in particular.
For each platform, we manually analyzed traffic from a laptop
and mobile device to create signatures of the application’s behavior

(i.e., the set of sites visited by each). We then compute the du-
ration of each user’s sessions. While Zeek provides the duration
of each network flow, the social media sites often use multiple
domains to serve content to users. For example, in a single Face-
book session, a client would receive traffic from facebook.com,
facebook.net, and fbcdn.net. So, to compute the duration of an
entire user session, we find the bounds of overlapping flows from
different domains belonging to the same site.
Another complication in computing duration is that the afore-
mentioned Facebook domains serve content for both Facebook
and Instagram services. We use a simple heuristic to differentiate
Facebook and Instagram sessions: if any of the domains in a set of
overlapping flows delivers Instagram-only content (e.g. traffic from
instagram.com), then we mark the entire session as an Instagram
session. Otherwise, we mark the session as Facebook. This heuris-
tic is reasonable according to our manual traffic analysis, but may
overstate Facebook usage and under-represent Instagram usage.
After computing duration for each site, we generate graphs of
each user’s aggregate duration per month for February through
May. We analyze only mobile traffic because there is not significant
desktop/laptop traffic even before the pandemic. Figure 6a shows
these durations for Facebook mobile users. For domestic users,
Facebook usage was relatively unchanged from February through
March, but decreased in May. However, the median duration for in-
ternational students increased during the campus shutdown. While
Facebook was more popular for domestic users than international
users in February, in May we see that the decrease in domestic
usage dampened the distinction between user groups.
We next plot Instagram duration in Figure 6b. For domestic
students, the median is relatively unchanged from February through
April, but decreases in May. The first quartile also decreases in
April and May, indicating that some users were not as active on
Instagram later in the campus shutdown. In contrast, the median
for international students increases in May. The first and third
quartiles also increase from February to March and stay steady
for the following months. So international students increased their
usage while domestic students maintained or decreased their usage.
Finally we show TikTok duration in Figure 6c. The median du-
ration for domestic users increases from February to March, then
decreases in April, and returns all the way back to February’s level
in May. However, the third quartile and 99th percentile both in-
crease steadily over the months. This indicates that a portion of
domestic users kept increasing their TikTok usage, while some
users went back to pre-pandemic levels of usage in May. Interna-
tional users were much less active on TikTok than domestic users,
but their median usage also increased in March and April compared
to February. Like domestic students, the 99th percentile for interna-
tional students also continuously increased over the months, but
the 1st percentile also continuously decreased. This suggests a lot
more variance in TikTok usage for this user group.
5.3 Gaming
An important part of online entertainment is gaming. Prior work [7]
found that overall gaming traffic increased, and that people started
playing games all the time, instead of just in the evenings or on
weekends. We also find that gaming traffic increased in our target
population. In this section we analyze two important platforms:
Steam and Nintendo Switches.
Steam. We developed a signature for Steam, an online plat-
5.3.1
form for PC games, from the set of domains that their customer
support recommends whitelisting [16]. We used this signature to
plot the total bytes of Steam traffic per user, which is shown in
Figure 7a. For each month, we show the traffic for any device that
visits Steam, though the set of devices are different for each month.
We see that domestic students increase their Steam usage in March,
but this usage falls in April and May. International students increase
their usage even more during March and April, but again this us-
age falls in May. The graph of the number of Steam connections,
shown in Figure 7b, presents a slightly different picture. Domestic
students’ median drops over time, while international students’
median increases in March and then drops again. We suspect these
graphs are different due to game releases or due to the way each
game operates. In any event, it seems students initially turned to
Steam as source of entertainment during the early periods of the
campus shutdown, but found other diversions as time passed.
5.3.2 Nintendo Switches. Despite the Nintendo Switch being re-
leased in 2017, sales soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. This

for jailbroken Switches to block Nintendo servers [2]. We filtered
these domains out of our network traffic logs to determine ac-
tual gameplay and plot a 3-day moving average of this traffic for
switches active in both February and May in Figure 8. While there
are heavy spikes of usage during academic break and the early
part of the Spring academic term, usage returned to almost pre-
pandemic levels in late April and early May before increasing again.
We suspect that Switch traffic falls immediately after spring break
due to classes resuming, but rises as boredom kicks in during the
middle of the term. Given their fixed use, we did not attempt to
segregate Switch device users.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper we provide another viewpoint to understanding how
Internet-based behaviors changed with the COVID-19 pandemic.
By leveraging the existing passive network monitoring pipeline
at UC San Diego, we are able to identify changes in application
behaviors (for work and leisure) as well as sub-population differ-
ences in the residence halls. We find that while per-device traffic
increased dramatically in April of 2020, traffic volumes returned to
pre-pandemic levels in May. Moreover, we find that entertainment
usage increased, classroom-related (i.e., Zoom) platforms were not
as utilized on the weekends as the weekdays, and international
students displayed different changes in recreational behavior than
their domestic counterparts. Our study not only provides a unique
viewpoint on the Internet usage of isolated individuals, but also
shows that sub-populations exhibited markedly different behaviors
even at the same university.

surge has been attributed to an increased demand for indoor en-
tertainment, as well as the release of the Animal Crossing: New
Horizons game on March 20, 2020 [8].
To detect Nintendo Switch devices from our network logs, we
measured the network traffic of a Switch to create a list of domains
that a Switch contacts regularly. We cross-checked this list with
90DNS [1], a tool that lets users block contact between a jailbroken
Switch and Nintendo servers. Given this signature, we classify
devices in our dataset as Switches if at least 50% of their traffic is to
the identified Nintendo servers. As users left campus and took their
devices home, the number of Nintendo switches fell markedly from
1,097 to 267. We also identified 40 new Switches that first appeared
in April and May, indicating that people were seeking out gaming
for entertainment during lock-down.
We measured the Nintendo server domains that are used for
system updates, game updates and downloads, and other non-
gameplay traffic, and confirmed these domains with another script
