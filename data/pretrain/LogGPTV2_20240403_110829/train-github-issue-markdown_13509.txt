  * Your Windows build number: (Type `ver` at a Windows Command Prompt)
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17738.1000]
  * What you're doing and what's happening: (Copy & paste specific commands and their output, or include screen shots)
The bottom lines of my screen get foozled, typically after a context switch in
which they are redrawn. Here's a typical example in which the tmux status line
somehow got duplicated, and an additional blank line was added. This is in
full screen mode, no resizing has occurred, and nothing was being written to
the screen - the problem just popped up after switching from another app back
to the console:

This is in a multi-monitor setup, but I've seen exactly the same problem on a
single-monitor setup.
When I look at the screen, sometimes I see a cursor down at the bottom - seems
like it is in a funny position and just ready to cause trouble:

  * What's wrong / what should be happening instead:
Bottom line should not be corrupted!
I've seen a few other console corruption issues listed here, but none of them
seem to match up exactly with this.
Note that I don't have exact steps to reproduce this, but it happens
constantly. If needed we can probably create a recipe to reproduce it.
