REFLECTIONS ON DESIGNING FOR 
SOCIAL INNOVATION IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR: 
A CASE STUDY IN NEW YORK CITY 
Eduardo Staszowski, Scott Brown, Benjamin Winter 
ABSTRACT
Today, a number of wide ranging systemic, social, economic, and environmental challenges are provoking 
governments at various levels to rethink their approach to public service delivery. Recognizing these societal and 
policy trends, and the need for radical social innovation in the public realm, the DESIS Lab at Parsons the New 
School for Design began in 2011 the multi-year research program “Public & Collaborative NYC” to investigate the 
assertion that design can serve as a catalyst for social innovation in public services in New York City. In 2012, the 
DESIS Lab entered a partnership with the Public Policy Lab, a non-profit dedicated to improving public services 
through design, and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) to develop a 
project entitled “Designing Services for Housing” which focused on the issue of affordable housing in the city.
This article examines the “Designing Services for Housing” project as a case study for identifying various 
challenges designers face in working in collaboration with public partners to effect social change in the public 
realm. Key areas of focus include the acknowledgement of the political position of the designer, the recognition 
and overcoming of epistemological barriers, and the management of risk aversion in the public sector. Building 
on reflections from this case study, the article concludes by highlighting various implications of designing for 
social innovation in the public sector and offers recommendations

1. INTRODUCTION & OVERVIEW 
Today, a number of wide ranging systemic, social, 
economic, and environmental challenges are 
provoking governments at various levels to rethink 
their approach to public service delivery. Following 
cuts in public spending and austerity measures to 
reduce budget deficits, alternatives to big-state 
welfare initiatives, such as public-private partnerships, 
the use of new technologies, as well as various 
strategies for increased public participation are 
now being considered. In the United States and 
across the world there is a growing perception of 
the need for new approaches to providing essential 
services for individuals and communities to thrive. 
What these new approaches will look like, how they 
will take shape, and what role design can play in 
effecting such change is still open for exploration 
and experimentation. In the United Kingdom – where, 
in the last few years, there has been a vigorous 
debate on the relation of design to public service and 
between social innovation and public policy – a crucial 
claim has been made by the Design Commission 
concerning the role of design in the provision of 
public services1. The claim is that “Design is integral 
to the DNA of each and every public service”, that one 
cannot improve public services without thinking about 
design. In their most recent report, the commission 
emphasizes the value of a design-based approach in 
promoting the kinds of innovation needed to address 
the challenges of an increasingly difficult public sector 
landscape, as well as the genuine need to provide 
better services to the public who are enduring the 
effects of continued economic instability2. However, 
while the report strongly advocates the beneficial 
potential good design can bring to any government 
operation or service delivery system (or design’s 
role in “creating cost-effective public services in the 
21st century”), there is still much work to be done in 
thinking about what a participatory design-driven 
approach to public service will look like, particularly in 
the American social and political context.
The common denominator to any new approach in 
this field, however, is the requirement of new forms

Kingdom Parliament created to advise government on how design

for the design community to better engage with policy makers.

of collaboration across a variety of practical domains. 
The traditional silos that separate government 
apparatus from community action can be broken 
down so new kinds of collaboration can be explored. 
Such partnerships can be effected and amplified by 
means of more participatory, horizontal practices such 
as co-governance, co-design, and co-production – in 
other words, through new forms of collaboration 
where people, experts, and governments work together 
to provide better public services. Design can play a 
transformative role in promoting this kind of change. 
One of the challenges of a design-driven approach is 
to accommodate multiple ways of knowing, so that the 
designer and other experts can employ their distinct 
forms of knowledge and expertise towards the solving 
of a particular problem.
1.1 Public & Collaborative NYC 
Recognizing the need for radical social innovation 
in the public realm, the DESIS Lab at Parsons the 
New School for Design began in 2011 the multi-year 
research program “Public & Collaborative NYC” to 
investigate the assertion that design can serve as 
a catalyst for social innovation in public services in 
New York City. In the context of such pressing issues, 
this initiative sought to ask the following questions: 
What are the roles design can play in building bridges 
between city government and people that can effect 
new kinds of social innovation in the provision of 
services for the public good? What are the forms 
of collaboration or strategies for building strong 
partnerships between public and private actors as well 
as local communities and individuals that will promote 
such innovation?
1.2 Designing Services for Housing 
In 2012, with the generous support of the Rockefeller 
Foundation, Parsons DESIS Lab entered a partnership 
with the Public Policy Lab – a non-profit dedicated to 
improving public services through design – and the 
New York City Department of Housing Preservation 
and Development (HPD) to develop “Designing 
Services for Housing” (DSH). DSH is a two-year 
design effort exploring “ways to engage community 
residents in the development of services related to 
city-supported affordable housing development and 
preservation in neighborhoods with significant public 
28
and private sector investment leveraged by HPD”3. 
HPD is the largest municipal housing preservation 
and development agency in the United States, and its 
mission is “to improve the availability, affordability 
and quality of housing in New York City” (HPD, 2013). 
The city’s affordable housing service landscape 
consists of a diverse network of government actors, 
regulatory bodies, private developers of affordable 
housing, property managers, community–based 
organizations, tenant associations and individuals. It is 
an inherently collaborative field, requiring interaction 
between a number of different parties, and making it 
an ideal space to explore the generative possibilities 
of enhanced forms of collaborative practice between 
public and private actors. Furthermore, the topic of 
housing is particularly urgent, as New York City has 
some of the lowest vacancy rates in the United States 
coupled with steadily increasing rent costs (figure 
1). Combined with the challenges of an enduring 
economic crisis, housing has become a crisis of its own 
in the city.
DSH was structured around two interconnected project 
tracks. The first focused on improving HPD’s services 
and interfaces with current and potential residents 
of subsidized housing for low- and moderate-income 
New Yorkers. The second focused on enabling resident 
social-networks and collaborative services4 in 
neighborhoods where HPD programs and initiatives 
are most active, such as the Melrose Commons Urban 
Renewal Area in the Melrose neighborhood of the 
South Bronx. The project began with a series of public 
lectures and two courses at Parsons that included 
co-design sessions with HPD staff, students, and Public 
Policy Lab fellows to create a “kit of ideas” for the

4  Collaborative services are a type of services based on collaborations 
between people. The main interactions of services generally occur 
between service users and service providers. In collaborative 
services this line is often blurred: service providers are service users 
and vice versa.

for increasing tenants and landlords’ understanding 
of the city’s housing maintenance code and protection 
of tenants’ rights; simplifying application processes 
for affordable units; improving HPD’s information 
channels and physical spaces; and creating networks 
among neighbors for mutual support.
During summer and fall of 2012, the design fellows 
convened by the Public Policy Lab6 continued to work 
with HPD managers, front-line staff, community-
based organizations, affordable-housing developers, 
and potential and current users of HPD’s services to 
identify and refine concepts for further development. 
Four proposals for enhancing the marketing, lottery, 
and lease-up processes for affordable housing were 
selected by HPD to be transformed into pilot projects

in 2013. Ideas about how to activate resident social-
networks and collaborative services around housing-
related issues, however, were considered outside the 
agency’s scope and therefore not developed as pilot 
proposals but left as recommendations for future 
exploration. This work will be published in a document 
(“The How-To-Guide”), which will provide technical 
and strategic guidance for the agency to implement 
the pilot proposals. For the purpose of this article, the 
“Designing Services for Housing” project serves as a 
case study to open up the discussion about the role of 
designers in working with government to effect social 
innovation in the pubic sector. 
2.  EVIDENCE & REFLECTION
During the DSH project, it was observed that the 
designers operating in this space encountered a 
number of epistemological, practical, and political 
challenges. This section describes the nature of the 
proposals that were put forward by the design team, 
and examines how such ideas predicated specific 
challenges identified during the project. It concludes 
by reiterating the implications of these challenges in 
30
order to suggest new possibilities for enhancing this 
type of interdisciplinary collaboration amongst design 
practitioners, design educators, civil servants and 
policy makers 7.
2.1 Acknowledging the political
“Given the importance of power in defining the problem 
and identifying stakeholders, it is all too easy to 
accept the stated goals of the collaboration, which 
means success is measured from the position of the 
powerful while equally legitimate outcomes, which 
favour low-power stakeholders, are excluded. Moreover, 
while collaboration can be highly productive in solving 
interorganizational problems, conflict also has a clear 
role in challenging existing frameworks and forcing 
domain change in directions considered by at least some 
members to be positive.” (Hardy and Phillips, 1998)
Current societal challenges are generating the need 
for radical innovation and the redesign of public 
services. Governments are challenged with finding 
new ways to provide better services in the context of 
broader economic crisis. While often resisting austerity 
measures and tax increases, the public is at the same 
time demanding better services. In this context, a new 
‘breed’ of (service) designers with expertise in user 
participation, appear as ‘natural’ candidates to help 
governments evolve and enhance services for the 
public good. 
However, designing in the public sector need not be 
merely exercises in making the State look user-friendly 
or making interactions with government 
a better ‘experience’. ‘User-centered’ 
approaches8 (i.e. “user as subject”) for 
enhancing service delivery commonly 
applied in the private sector cannot 
be automatically transferred to 
this context without engaging 
in a discussion about the socio-
political implications of this work. A 
movement towards a ‘participatory’ approach (i.e. “user 
as partner”) in this case is not only appropriate but also 
required. Here, citizens are key stakeholders in public 
problems and should be considered as participants 
in the construction of their own futures and not only 
participants in the design process simply as users or 
consumers9. 
The challenge for designers operating in this space is 
how to negotiate their inherent political position as 
agents of change accountable, not to a client or clients 
who have engaged them for a specific purpose, but to 
the diverse needs of the broader public(s). Therefore, 
the traditional client-consultant relationship in which 
the designer is an expert beholden to very specific 
interests is challenged. In this sense, the work of 
designers in the public realm is not simply a matter 
of enhancing existing service structures or even 
maintaining current social practices. It can be thought 
of in terms of playing a more transformative and 
political role. 
The DSH project is partly an experiment in testing 
and understanding the limits and opportunities of this 
new role. For example, DSH explored how designers 
could be proponents of service co-production in the 
public sector, or more specifically how the city could 
look at collaborative social innovations as inspiration 
for different forms of public partnership and reshaping 
public services10. Thinking of service provision in this 
manner can constitute a challenge to the existing 
order in which public agencies operate. Most of the
