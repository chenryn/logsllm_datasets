### Figure 5: Empirical CDF of Generalization Error

**Description:**
- **X-axis:** Generalization error (difference between training and testing accuracy).
- **Y-axis:** Fraction of classes with generalization error less than the value on the X-axis.
- **Curves:**
  - **Regular Models (without defense):** These models show a higher generalization error, indicated by curves that lean more to the right.
  - **Privacy-Preserving Models (with defense):** These models exhibit a lower generalization error, with curves leaning more to the left.

**Observation:**
- The privacy-preserving models have a smaller generalization error compared to regular models, indicating better generalization performance.

### Figure 6: Distribution of Classifier Output on Training Data

**Dataset:** Purchase100, Class 50

**Without Defense:**
- All samples from class 50 are classified with high confidence (probability close to 1).

**With Defense:**
- The prediction probability is spread across multiple classes, adding uncertainty and mitigating information leakage.

**Test Data:**
- The distribution on test data (bottom figure) is similar to the training data (middle figure), showing consistent behavior.

### Figure 7: Prediction Accuracy on Members vs. Non-Members

**Description:**
- **X-axis:** Prediction accuracy.
- **Y-axis:** Frequency or density.
- **Curves:**
  - **Regular Models (without defense):** Larger gap between member and non-member curves, indicating higher information leakage.
  - **Privacy-Preserving Models (with defense):** Smaller gap between member and non-member curves, reducing information leakage.

**Gaps in Prediction Accuracy:**
- **Maximum Gap:**
  - Purchase100: 0.02 (with defense) vs. 0.34 (without defense)
  - Texas100: 0.05 (with defense) vs. 0.25 (without defense)
  - CIFAR100-Densenet: 0.06 (with defense) vs. 0.56 (without defense)
- **Average Gap:**
  - Purchase100: 0.007 (with defense) vs. 0.013 (without defense)
  - Texas100: 0.004 (with defense) vs. 0.016 (without defense)
  - CIFAR100-Densenet: 0.005 (with defense) vs. 0.021 (without defense)

### Figure 8: Prediction Uncertainty on Members vs. Non-Members

**Description:**
- **X-axis:** Prediction uncertainty.
- **Y-axis:** Frequency or density.
- **Curves:**
  - **Regular Models (without defense):** Higher prediction uncertainty for non-members.
  - **Privacy-Preserving Models (with defense):** Reduced prediction uncertainty, making it harder to distinguish members from non-members.

**Observation:**
- Privacy-preserving models reduce the difference in prediction uncertainty between members and non-members, further enhancing privacy.
