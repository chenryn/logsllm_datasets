As I am already including:
    "node/node.d.ts": {
        "commit": "e850b6ac0d59fee86dd7cb6a1be2caf6400bde14"
    }
In my `tsd.json` file and angular also includes those, I get lots of `error
TS2300: Duplicate identifier ...` errors.
Is there really no solution for this? If there is a solution, can someone
point me to it because I cannot find something that would make it work,
besides me not including these typings in my own `tsd.json` file.
