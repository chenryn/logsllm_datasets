ABSTRACT
Peer-to-peer approaches to anonymous communication pro-
mise to eliminate the scalability concerns and central vulner-
ability points of current networks such as Tor. However, the
P2P setting introduces many new opportunities for attack,
and previous designs do not provide an adequate level of
anonymity. We propose ShadowWalker: a new low-latency
P2P anonymous communication system, based on a random
walk over a redundant structured topology. We base our de-
sign on shadows that redundantly check and certify neigh-
bor information; these certiﬁcations enable nodes to perform
random walks over the structured topology while avoiding
route capture and other attacks.
We analytically calculate the anonymity provided by Sha-
dowWalker and show that it performs well for moderate lev-
els of attackers, and is much better than the state of the art.
We also design an extension that improves forwarding per-
formance at a slight anonymity cost, while at the same time
protecting against selective DoS attacks. We show that our
system has manageable overhead and can handle moderate
churn, making it an attractive new design for P2P anony-
mous communication.

of pervasive surveillance [49]. Anonymous communication
hides the identity of communication partners from third par-
ties, or hides user identity from the remote party. The Tor
network [16], deployed in 2003, now serves hundreds of thou-
sands of users [25] and carries terabytes of traﬃc a day [35].
Originally an experimental network used by privacy enthu-
siasts, it is now entering mainstream use; a recent attack
showed a number of foreign consulates were using Tor to
avoid surveillance by their host countries [19].
The capacity of Tor is already strained and to support
a growing population a peer-to-peer approach will likely be
necessary, as P2P networks allow the network capacity to
scale with the number of users. Indeed, several proposals for
peer-to-peer anonymous communication have been put for-
ward [18,28,33,38]. However, several recent results [5,29,47]
have shown that even the best proposed systems are vulner-
able to attacks on anonymity, motivating a new approach
for P2P anonymous communication.
We propose a low-latency peer-to-peer anonymous com-
munication system that is based on a random walk over
redundant structured topologies. Our main idea is the cre-
ation of shadow nodes, which redundantly verify the correct-
ness of a given nodes’ routing table and certify it as correct.
Such certiﬁcates can then be used to check the steps of a ran-
dom walk; by using certiﬁcates rather than online checks, we
can avoid information leak attacks [29]. We show that our
design is eﬀectively able to prevent route capture attacks by
employing a small number of shadows per node. We also
analytically model the eﬀects of a restricted topology on the
anonymity of the system and show that, with an appropriate
choice of an underlying topology, we can mitigate this eﬀect
and achieve strong anonymity. In particular, the anonymity
levels achieved by our system are much higher than those of
Salsa [33] when 20% of all nodes are compromised.
We present an extension to our system that improves ano-
nymous communication performance at the cost of slightly
weakening the anonymity protection. This extension should
result in latency and bandwidth constraints similar to those
achieved by Tor [16]. It also provides an eﬀective defense
against the selective denial-of-service attack on anonymous
systems [5]. We also veriﬁed our analytic model with the
help of simulations. We show that our system has manage-
able communication and computation overheads, and is able
to handle a moderate amount of churn in the network. As
such, it presents a promising new direction for peer-to-peer
anonymous communication.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give
an overview of anonymous communication and motivate the
161need for a new peer-to-peer approach. We propose the Sha-
dowWalker scheme based on a redundant structured topol-
ogy in Section 3 and analytically evaluate the anonymity
provided by our scheme in Section 4. We describe our exper-
imental results in Section 5 and the related work in Section 6.
Finally, we present our concluding remarks in Section 7.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we present a brief overview of anonymous
communication. We discuss the state of art in peer-to-peer
anonymous communication systems and motivate the need
for a new design. We also describe our threat model.
2.1 Low-Latency Anonymous Communication
Systems
Anonymous communication systems can be classiﬁed into
low-latency and high-latency systems. High-latency sys-
tems like Mixminion [10] and Mixmaster [30] are designed to
be secure even against a powerful global passive adversary;
however, the message transmission times for such systems
are typically of the order of several hours. This makes them
unsuitable for use in applications involving interactive traf-
ﬁc, such as web browsing and instant messaging. Our goal is
to design a low-latency P2P anonymous system, so we will
focus our discussion on low-latency designs.
Tor [16] is a popular low-latency anonymous communica-
tion system. Users (clients) download a list of servers from
central directory authorities and build anonymous paths us-
ing onion routing [46]. There are several problems with
Tor’s architecture. First, the reliance on central directory
authorities makes them an attractive target for the attack-
ers. Second, Tor serves hundreds of thousands of users and
the use of a relatively small number of servers to build ano-
nymous paths becomes a performance bottleneck. Finally,
Tor requires all users to maintain a global view of all the
servers. As the number of servers increases, maintaining a
global view of the system becomes costly, since churn will
cause frequent updates and large bandwidth overhead.
In order to address these problems, a peer-to-peer archi-
tecture will likely be necessary. However, peer-to-peer net-
works present new challenges to anonymity, one of which is
the ability to locate relays for anonymous traﬃc.
2.2 Peer-to-Peer Anonymous Communication
Several designs for peer-to-peer low latency anonymous
communication have been proposed. They can be broadly
classiﬁed into two categories.
2.2.1 Random Paths Using Lookup
The design of Salsa [33] is similar to Tor, in that a circuit
is built by selecting three random nodes in the network and
constructing a circuit through them. For scalability reasons,
Salsa does not maintain a global view; instead, it uses a spe-
cially designed secure lookup operation over a custom dis-
tributed hash table (DHT) to locate forwarder nodes. The
secure lookups use redundant checks to mitigate potential
attacks; these checks are able to limit the bias an adversary
can introduce in the lookup, but make Salsa susceptible to
information leak attacks: attackers can detect a large frac-
tion of lookups and thus infer the path structure [29]. This
results in a tradeoﬀ between robustness to active and pas-
sive attacks, and even at the optimal point in this tradeoﬀ,
Salsa does not provide adequate level of anonymity. Salsa
is also vulnerable to a selective denial-of-service (DoS) at-
tack, where nodes try to deny service for circuits that they
cannot compromise [5]. Selective DoS presents a signiﬁcant
problem for Salsa, violating anonymity guarantees when a
moderate number of nodes are compromised.
AP3 [28] has a similar structure where paths are built by
selecting random relays using a secure lookup mechanism [6].
The design of AP3 is more similar to Crowds [37] than
to Tor, with paths being formed by performing a stochas-
tic expected-length random walk. The stochastic nature of
AP3 makes it diﬃcult for a rogue node to decide whether
its preceding hop is the initiator or simply a relay in the
path; however, for low-latency communication, timing at-
tacks may make this decision simpler. Similar to Salsa, the
secure lookup used in AP3 reveals a lot of information about
the lookup initiator, and makes the user vulnerable to pas-
sive information leak attacks [29].
2.2.2 Random Walks on Restricted Topologies
An alternate approach is to connect relays into a restricted
(non-clique) topology and construct circuits along paths in
this topology. For example, in Tarzan [18], each node has a
small set of mimics, and all circuits must be created on links
between mimics. The use of a restricted topology has the
advantage that the local view at each hop is suﬃcient to ex-
tend the circuit. They also provide an opportunity for cover
traﬃc to be sent along all the links in the restricted topology,
something that would be infeasible for the full clique topol-
ogy even of the current size of Tor, let alone much larger
P2P networks of the future.
Though communication in Tarzan is carried out over links
between mimics, to be able to verify that paths are con-
structed correctly, each node needs to maintain a global
view of the system, updated using a gossip protocol. This
limits Tarzan to networks of about 10 000 or fewer nodes.
MorphMix [38] was designed to eliminate such scaling con-
straints by creating a randomized, unstructured overlay be-
tween relays, with circuits built on paths along the overlay.
MorphMix faced a similar challenge in needing to trust a
node to correctly specify its neighbors when extending a
circuit. Instead of maintaining a global view, MorphMix de-
signed a mechanism involving witness nodes and a collusion
detection mechanism to verify neighbor information. How-
ever, the collusion detection mechanism can be circumvented
by a set of colluding adversaries who model the internal state
of each node, thus violating anonymity guarantees [47].
Our design seeks to combine the best properties of both of
these designs: our system is designed to scale to millions of
nodes, as in MorphMix, but we use a structured topology to
verify neighbor links and are able to resist collusion attacks.
2.3 Threat Model
Low-latency anonymous communication systems are not
designed to to be secure against a global passive adversary.
In particular, an adversary who can observe the whole net-
work can use end-to-end timing analysis [24,42,45,55] to link
two ends of a circuit. We consider a partial adversary who
controls a fraction f of all the nodes in the network. This
set of malicious nodes colludes and can launch both passive
and active attacks. In terms of the standard terminology in-
troduced by Raymond [36], our adversary is internal, active,
and static.
P2P networks are vulnerable to Sybil attacks [17], which
162would allow an adversary to attain an f arbitrarily close to 1.
In context of secure structured P2P networks, there are two
major schools of thought regarding Sybil defense. Castro et
al. [6] proposed the use of a trusted authority which issues
certiﬁcates to nodes, that binds the node identiﬁer with a
public key. The authority limits the number of certiﬁcates
and prevents Sybil attacks. The second school of thought
uses some scarce resource to bound the number of Sybil
identities. For example, if the adversary has access to a lim-
ited number of IP addresses, then allowing one identity per
IP address would limit the Sybil attack. The node identiﬁer
in this case is considered to be the hash of the IP address.
Recently, there has been a new line of research that uses so-
cial networks for defense against Sybil attacks [11,12,53,54].
Here, node identiﬁers could be assigned based on their posi-
tion in the social graph. Lesueur et al. [23] propose a Sybil
proof distributed approach using social networks in which
nodes cannot choose their identiﬁers.
We recognize that all the above defenses have some lim-
itations, but coming up with eﬀective distributed defenses
to the problem of Sybil attacks is an open research prob-
lem, and not a subject of this paper. Our assumptions
are that the fraction of colluding identities f < 0.2, and
that the node identiﬁers belonging to the adversary are dis-
tributed uniformly at random in the ID space (adversary
cannot choose its node identiﬁers). We do not consider
f ≥ 0.2 because it becomes very challenging to perform
secure routing in such a network. We emphasize that the
above assumptions are standard assumptions used in secure
lookup literature [6, 22, 33], which we will review below.
2.4 Structured Peer-to-Peer Networks
We use structured peer-to-peer topologies, such as Chord [44]
or Pastry [39] (also known as distributed hash tables, or
DHTs), as a foundation for anonymous peer-to-peer commu-
nication. Each node in a structured peer-to-peer topology
is assigned a collection of neighbors, also known as ﬁngers.
Finger relationships are assigned using a mathematical for-
mula based on node identiﬁers. This allows the relationships
to be veriﬁed externally, presenting fewer opportunities for
attack. A node maintains a routing table, which consists
of the IP addresses and the public keys of its ﬁngers. By
default, DHTs are extremely vulnerable to attacks on the
lookup mechanism [43, 48]. Attackers can intercept lookup
requests and return incorrect results by listing a colluding
malicious node as the closest node to a key. Next, we discuss
several mechanisms for secure lookup.
2.4.1 Castro et al.’s Secure Lookup [6]
The key ideas in this scheme are a routing failure test
and redundant routing. The failure test makes use of the
observation that the density of honest nodes is greater than
the density of malicious nodes. The idea behind redundant
routing is to ensure that multiple copies of messages are
sent to the key root via diverse routes. Castro et al. [6] also
proposed the use of a constrained routing table, in which
each slot can have only a single possible node as a neighbor.
2.4.2 Halo [22] and Salsa [33]
In both the schemes, secure lookups are based on redun-
dant routing. Note that naive approaches to redundant rout-
ing do not work well because of convergence of lookups. Due
to convergence, a few nodes may be able to intercept all
the redundant lookups, and subvert the result. Salsa pro-
poses the use of a custom DHT topology such that redun-
dant lookups take diverse paths with high probability. Halo
makes use of the observation that to perform a lookup for
A, it suﬃces to lookup the nodes which have A as its ﬁnger,
and then query them.
The above mechanisms are quite eﬀective at ensuring that
lookup returns the actual closest node to the chosen identi-
ﬁer. However, anonymous communication systems that use
secure lookups to locate forwarder nodes are susceptible to
information leak attacks [29].
3. SHADOWWALKER
To motivate our design, we ﬁrst brieﬂy describe a simple
random walk–based anonymity protocol and discuss the at-
tacks on it. In a random walk–based protocol, an initiator
ﬁrst sets up a circuit with a random ﬁnger A. To further
extend the circuit, initiator sends A a random index i, and
A returns the public key of the ﬁnger B corresponding to
the index i (i’th entry in the routing table). The initiator
can then extend the circuit via A to B. By iterating these
steps, a circuit of arbitrary length can be established. The
above protocol is susceptible to the following attacks:
Route Capture: An intermediate node A in a circuit may
lie when asked about its ﬁnger B and return an incorrect
public key. Since traﬃc for B will be forwarded through A,
A can give its own public key and then pretend to be B.
Further, it can perform the same attack in the subsequent
steps, emulating the rest of the hops.
Restricted Topology: The terminus of the random walk in
restricted topologies reveals some information about the ini-
tiator of the random walk [4,8]. This is because only a subset
of the nodes in the network can reach the terminus in a given
number of hops. For instance, suppose that the ﬁrst hop in
a two-hop random walk is not compromised, but the second
hop is compromised. In this scenario, although the initia-
tor cannot be directly identiﬁed, the attacker can be certain
that the initiator lies in the set of nodes which have the ﬁrst
hop as ﬁngers. Because of route capture attacks, the ran-
dom walk can be thought to terminate after encountering
the ﬁrst malicious node (say A). If the walk has traversed i
hops so far, then the initiator of the random walk must be
within the set of nodes that can reach the previous hop of
node A in i − 1 hops. For ﬁxed-length random walks, the
