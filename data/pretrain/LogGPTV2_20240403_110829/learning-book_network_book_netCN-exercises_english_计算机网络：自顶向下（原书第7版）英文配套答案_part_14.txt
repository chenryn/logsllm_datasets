Each departmental hub is a single collision domain that can have a maximum throughput
of 100 Mbps. The links connecting the web server and the mail server has a maximum
throughput of 100 Mbps. Hence, if the three collision domains and the web server and
mail server send out data at their maximum possible rates of 100 Mbps each, a maximum
total aggregate throughput of 500 Mbps can be achieved among the 11 end systems.
Problem25
All of the 11 end systems will lie in the same collision domain. In this case, the
maximum total aggregate throughput of 10o Mbps is possible among the 1l end sytems.

Problem28
The IP addresses for those three computers (from left to right) in EE department are:
111.111.1.1, 111.111.1.2, 111.111.1.3. The subnet mask is 111.111.1/24.
The IP addresses for those three computers (from left to right) in CS department are:
111.111.2.1, 111.111.2.2, 111.111.2.3. The subnet mask is 111.111.2/24.
The router's interface card that connects to port 1 can be configured to contain two sub-
interface IP addresses: 111.111.1.0 and 111.111.2.0. The first one is for the subnet of EE
department, and the second one is for the subnet of CS department. Each IP address is
associated with a VLAN ID. Suppose 111.111.1.0 is associated with VLAN 11, and
111.111.2.0 is associated with VLAN 12. This means that each frame that comes from
subnet 111.111.1/24 will be added an 802.1q tag with VLAN ID 11, and each frame that
comes from 111.111.2/24 will be added an 802.1q tag with VLAN ID 12.
Suppose that host A in EE department with IP address 111.111.1.1 would like to send an
IP datagram to host B (111.111.2.1) in CS department. Host A first encapsulates the IP
datagram (destined to 111.111.2.1) into a frame with a destination MAC address equal to
the MAC address of the router’s interface card that connects to port 1 of the switch. Once
the router receives the frame, then it passes it up to IP layer, which decides that the IP
datagram should be forwarded to subnet 111.111.2/24 via sub-interface 111.111.2.0.
Then the router encapsulates the IP datagram into a frame and sends it to port 1. Note that
---

this frame has an 802.1q tag VLAN ID 12. Once the switch receives the frame port 1, it
knows that this frame is destined to VLAN with ID 12, so the switch will send the frame
to Host B which is in CS department. Once Host B receives this frame, it will remove the
802.1q tag

Problem31
(The following description is short, but contains all major key steps and key protocols
involved.)
Your computer first uses DHCP to obtain an IP address. You computer first creates a
special IP datagram destined to 255.255.255.255 in the DHCP server discovery step, and
puts it in a Ethemet frame and broadcast it in the Ethernet. Then following the steps in
the DHCP protocol, you computer is able to get an IP address with a given lease time.
A DHCP server on the Ethernet also gives your computer a list of IP addresses of first-
hop routers, the subnet mask of the subnet where your computer resides, and the
addresses of local DNS servers (if they exist).
Since your computer's ARP cache is initially empty, your computer will use ARP
protocol to get the MAC addresses of the first-hop router and the local DNS server.
Your computer first will get the IP address of the Web page you would like to download.
If the local DNS server does not have the IP address, then your computer will use DNS
protocol to find the IP address of the Web page.
Once your computer has the IP address of the Web page, then it will send out the HTTP
request via the first-hop router if the Web page does not reside in a local Web server. The
---
## Page 116
further encapsulated into IP packets, and finally encapsulated into Ethernet frames. Your
computer sends the Ethernet frames destined to the first-hop router. Once the router
receives the frames, it passes them up into IP layer, checks its routing table, and then
sends the packets to the right interface out of all of its interfaces.
Then your IP packets will be routed through the Internet until they reach the Web server.
The server hosting the Web page will send back the Web page to your computer via
HTTP response messages. Those messages will be encapsulated into TCP packets and
then further into IP packets. Those IP packets follow IP routes and finally reach your
first-hop router, and then the router will forward those IP packets to your computer by
encapsulating them into Ethernet frames.
Problem32
a) Each flow evenly shares a link’s capacity with other flows traversing that link, then the
80 flows crossing the B to access-router 10 Gbps links (as well as the access router to
border router links) will each only receive 10 Gbps / 80 = 125 Mbps
b) In Topology of Figure 5.31, there are four distinct paths between the first and third
tier-2 switches, together providing 40 Gbps for the traffic from racks 1-4 to racks 9-12
Similarly, there are four links between second and fourth tier-2 switches, together
providing 40 Gbps for the traffic from racks 5-8 to 13-16. Thus the total aggregate
bandwidth is 80 Gbps, and the value per flow rate is 1 Gbps.
c) Now 20 flows will need to share each 1 Gbps bandwidth between pairs of TOR
switches. So the host-to-host bit rate will be 0.5 Gbps.
Problem33
a)Both email and video application uses the fourth rack for 0.1 percent of the time.
b)Probability that both applications need fourth rack is 0.001*0.001 = 10-°.
c)Suppose the first three racks are for video, the next rack is a shared rack for both
video and email, and the next three racks are for email. Let's assume that the fourth
rack has all the data and software needed for both the email and video applications
With the topology of Figure 5.31, both applications will have enough intra-bandwidth
as long as both are not simultaneously using the fourth rack. From part b, both are
using the fourth rack for no more than .00oo1 % of time, which is within the .0001%
requirement.

Chapter7ReviewQuestions
1.In infrastructure mode of operation, each wireless host is connected to the larger
network via a base station (access point). If not operating in infrastructure mode, a
network operates in ad-hoc mode. In ad-hoc mode, wireless hosts have no
infrastructure with which to connect. In the absence of such infrastructure, the hosts
themselves must provide for services such as routing, address assignment, DNS-like
name translation, and more.
2.a) Single hop, infrastructure-based
b) Single hop, infrastructure-less
c) Multi-hop, infrastructure-based
d) Multi-hop, infrastructure-less
3.Path loss is due to the attenuation of the electromagnetic signal when it travels
through matter. Multipath propagation results in blurring of the received signal at the
receiver and occurs when portions of the electromagnetic wave reflect off objects and
ground, taking paths of different lengths between a sender and receiver. Interference
from other sources occurs when the other source is also transmitting in the same
frequency range as the wireless network.
4. a) Increasing the transmission power
b) Reducing the transmission rate
5. APs transmit beacon frames. An AP's beacon frames will be transmitted over one of
the 11 channels. The beacon frames permit nearby wireless stations to discover and
identify the AP.
6.False
7.APs transmit beacon frames. An AP's beacon frames will be transmitted over one of
the 11 channels. The beacon frames permit nearby wireless stations to discover and
dentify the AP
8.False
9. Each wireless station can set an RTS threshold such that the RTS/CTS sequence is
used only when the data frame to be transmitted is longer than the threshold. This
ensures that RTS/CTS mechanism is used only for large frames.
10. No, there wouldn’t be any advantage. Suppose there are two stations that want to
transmit at the same time, and they both use RTS/CTS. If the RTS frame is as long as
a DATA frames, the channel would be wasted for as long as it would have been
---
## Page 118
wasted for two colliding DATA frames. Thus, the RTS/CTS exchange is only useful
when the RTS/CTS frames are significantly smaller than the DATA frames.
11. Initially the switch has an entry in its forwarding table which associates the wireless
station with the earlier AP. When the wireless station associates with the new AP, the
new AP creates a frame with the wireless station's MAC address and broadcasts the
frame. The frame is received by the switch. This forces the switch to update its
forwarding table, so that frames destined to the wireless station are sent via the new
AP.
12. Any ordinary Bluetooth node can be a master node whereas access points in 802.11
networks are special devices (normal wireless devices like laptops cannot be used as
access points).
13. False
14. “Opportunistic Scheduling” refers to matching the physical layer protocol to channel
conditions between the sender and the receiver, and choosing the receivers to which
packets will be sent based on channel condition. This allows the base station to make
best use of the wireless medium.
15. UMTS to GSM and CDMA-2000 to IS-95.
16. The data plane role of eNodeB is to forward datagram between UE (over the LTE
radio access network) and the P-GW. Its control plane role is to handle registration
and mobility signaling traffic on behalf of the UE.
The mobility management entity (MME) performs connection and mobility
management on behalf of the UEs resident in the cell it controls. It receives UE
subscription information from the HHS.
The Packet Data Network Gateway (P-GW) allocates IP addresses to the UEs and
performs QoS enforcement. As a tunnel endpoint it also performs datagram
encapsulation/decapsulation when forwarding a datagram to/from a UE.
The Serving Gateway (S-GW) is the data-plane mobility anchor point as all UE
traffic will pass through the S-GW. The S-GW also performs charging/billing
functions and lawful traffic interception.
17. In 3G architecture, there are separate network components and paths for voice and
data, i.e., voice goes through public telephone network, whereas data goes through
public Internet. 4G architecture is a unified, all-IP network architecture, i.e., both
voice and data are carried in IP datagrams to/from the wireless device to several
gateways and then to the rest of the Internet.
---
## Page 119
The 4G network architecture clearly separates data and control plane, which is
different from the 3G architecture.
The 4G architecture has an enhanced radio access network (E-UTRAN) that is
different from 3G's radio access network UTRAN.
18. No. A node can remain connected to the same access point throughout its connection
to the Internet (hence, not be mobile). A mobile node is the one that changes its point
of attachment into the network over time. Since the user is always accessing the
Internet through the same access point, she is not mobile.
19. A permanent address for a mobile node is its IP address when it is at its home
network. A care-of-address is the one its gets when it is visiting a foreign network.
The COA is assigned by the foreign agent (which can be the edge router in the
foreign network or the mobile node itself).
20. False
21. The home network in GSM maintains a database called the home location register
(HLR), which contains the permanent cell phone number and subscriber profile
information about each of its subscribers. The HLR also contains information about
the current locations of these subscribers. The visited network maintains a database
known as the visitor location register (VLR) that contains an entry for each mobile
user that is currently in the portion of the network served by the VLR. VLR entries
thus come and go as mobile users enter and leave the network.
The edge router in home network in mobile IP is similar to the HLR in GSM and the
edge router in foreign network is similar to the VLR in GSM.
22. Anchor MSC is the MSC visited by the mobile when a call first begins; anchor MSC
thus remains unchanged during the call. Throughout the call's duration and regardless
of the number of inter-MSC transfers performed by the mobile, the call is routed from
the home MSC to the anchor MSC, and then from the anchor MSC to the visited
MSC where the mobile is currently located.
23. a) Local recovery
b) TCP sender awareness of wireless links
c) Split-connection approaches

Problem5
a)The two APs will typically have different SSIDs and MAC addresses. A wireless
station arriving to the cafe will associate with one of the SSIDs (that is, one of the
APs). After association, there is a virtual link between the new station and the AP.
Label the APs AP1 and AP2. Suppose the new station associates with AP1. When the
new station sends a frame, it will be addressed to AP1. Although AP2 will also
receive the frame, it will not process the frame because the frame is not addressed to
it. Thus, the two ISPs can work in parallel over the same channel. However, the two
ISPs will be sharing the same wireless bandwidth. If wireless stations in different
ISPs transmit at the same time, there will be a collision. For 802.11b, the maximum
aggregate transmission rate for the two ISPs is 11 Mbps.
b) Now if two wireless stations in different ISPs (and hence different channels) transmit
at the same time, there will not be a collision. Thus, the maximum aggregate
transmission rate for the two ISPs is 22 Mbps for 802.11b.

Problem 6
Suppose that wireless station H1 has 10o0 long frames to transmit. (H1 may be an AP
that is forwarding an MP3 to some other wireless station.) Suppose initially H1 is the
only station that wants to transmit, but that while half-way through transmitting its first
every other station's signal (that is, no hidden terminals). Before transmitting, H2 will
sense that the channel is busy, and therefore choose a random backoff value.
Now suppose that after sending its first frame, H1 returns to step 1; that is, it waits a short
period of times (DIFS) and then starts to transmit the second frame. H1's second frame
will then be transmitted while H2 is stuck in backoff, waiting for an idle channel. Thus,
H1 should get to transmit all of its 100o frames before H2 has a chance to access the
channel. On the other hand, if H1 goes to step 2 after transmitting a frame, then it too
chooses a random backoff value, thereby giving a fair chance to H2. Thus, fairness was
the rationale behind this design choice.
Problem 7
A frame without data is 32 bytes long. Assuming a transmission rate of 11 Mbps, the time
to transmit a control frame (such as an RTS frame, a CTS frame, or an ACK frame) is
(256 bits)/(11 Mbps) = 23 usec. The time required to transmit the data frame is (8256
bits)/(11 Mbps) = 751
DIFS + RTS + SIFS + CTS + SIFS + FRAME + SIFS + ACK
= DIFS + 3SIFS + (3*23 + 751) usec = DIFS + 3SIFS + 820 usec
