User: I want to build an application with an HTML5 interface that persists data using google-app-engine and could do with some some advice to avoid spending a ton of time going down the wrong path.
What is puzzling me is the interaction between HTML5, Javascript/JQuery and Python.
Let's say, I have designed an HTML5 site. I believeetc  I can use prompts and forms to collect data entered by users.  I also know that I can use Javascript to grab that data and keep it in the form of objects...I need objects for reasons I'll not go into.
But when I look at the app-engine example, it has HTML form information embedded in the Python code which is what is used to store the data in the cloud Datastore.
This raises the following questions in my mind:

do I simply use Python to get user entered information?
how does python interact with a separately described HTML5/CSS2 forms and prompts?
does Javascript/Jquery play any role with respect to data?
are forms and prompts the best way to capture use data? (Is there a better alternative)

As background:

It is a while since I programmed but have used HTML and CSS a fair bit 
I did the Javascript and Jquery courses at Codeacademy
I was considering using Go which looks funky but "experimental" worries me and I cannot find a good IDE such as devTable
I can do the Python course at Codeacademy pretty quickly if I need it? I think I may need to understand there objects syntax

I appreciate this is basic basic stuff but if I can get my plumbing sorted, I doubt that I'll have to ask too man more really stupid questsions

Assistant: My thanks to all of you for taking time to respond. Each response was useful it it's own way.
The AJAX/JQuery looks a promising route for me, so many thanks for the link on that. I'll stop equivocating and stick with Python rather than try Go and start working through the tutorials and courses.
