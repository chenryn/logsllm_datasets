This is an informational  message only.",   "This message is an early warning that the map-cache size is approaching its limit. The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR encounters traffic to many different EID-prefixes though this may also occur if someone is performing an address-space scan. If the cache size limit is reached new entries will replace old/inactive ones as required. If the map-cache limit is set too low actively used EID-to-RLOC mappings may be replaced continously which causes traffic to be dropped while these mappings are re-acquired. As long as only inactive map-cache entries are replaced the impact should not be significant. Furthermore it is worth noting that it is normal for the cache to have a limit for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the map-cache using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table ] map-cache. It can also be cleared with clear ip[v6] lisp [eid-table ] map-cache. This syslog message can be turned off by removing the warning-threshold  configuration statement from the map-cache-limit configuration."
