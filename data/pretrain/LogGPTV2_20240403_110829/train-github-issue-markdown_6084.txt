I am encountering an issue with the `UriSafeTokenGenerator` class in the Symfony Security component, specifically at line 48 in the following file:
[UriSafeTokenGenerator.php#L48](https://github.com/symfony/security/blob/master/Csrf/TokenGenerator/UriSafeTokenGenerator.php#L48).

I have installed the `polyfill-php70` package, but it has not resolved the problem.

For reference, I have attached a screenshot from December 7, 2015, at 14:44:37, which illustrates the issue:
