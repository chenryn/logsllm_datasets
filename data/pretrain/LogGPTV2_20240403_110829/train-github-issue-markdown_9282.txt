ESModules without dynamic import is incomplete.  
We cannot do this:
    if( whenWeNeed() )
        import 'some_thing';
nor this:
    const need= whatWeNeed();
        import need;
Only dynamic import can make ESM as strong as CommonJS or AMD.
Maybe there are some security reasons. But local dynamic import should be
retain.
