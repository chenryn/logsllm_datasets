### Title: Black Hat USA 2021: Sleight of ARM - Demystifying Intel Houdini

**Abstract:**

ARM architecture is rapidly gaining prominence in the computer industry. In recent years, several major players have transitioned from x86-based processors to ARM. One of the most notable examples is Apple, which has facilitated this shift with Rosetta 2, a binary translator that has garnered significant attention from researchers and reverse engineers. However, it may come as a surprise that Intel also has its own binary translator, known as Houdini, which enables the execution of ARM binaries on x86 platforms.

In this presentation, we will delve into Intel's proprietary Houdini translator, primarily used by Android on x86 devices such as high-end Chromebooks and desktop Android emulators. We will begin with a high-level overview of how Houdini operates and is integrated into processes. Next, we will explore the low-level internals of the Houdini engine and its memory model, highlighting several security vulnerabilities that it introduces to the processes using it. Finally, we will discuss methods to escape the Houdini environment, execute arbitrary ARM and x83 code, and develop Houdini-targeted malware that can evade existing platform analysis.

**Key Points:**
- **Overview of ARM Adoption:** The increasing adoption of ARM architecture by major industry players.
- **Intel Houdini Introduction:** An introduction to Intel's Houdini binary translator and its primary use cases.
- **High-Level Functionality:** A detailed explanation of how Houdini works and is loaded into processes.
- **Low-Level Internals:** An in-depth look at the Houdini engine and memory model, including identified security weaknesses.
- **Security Implications:** Techniques for escaping the Houdini environment, executing arbitrary code, and developing targeted malware.

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Intel Houdini, its operational mechanisms, and the potential security risks associated with its use.
