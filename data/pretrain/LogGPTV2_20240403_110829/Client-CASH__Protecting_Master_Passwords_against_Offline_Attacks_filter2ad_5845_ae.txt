ble predicate sequences such that for {P1, . . . , Pn} ∈ O, Pm ∈ {P0,(cid:96)m , . . . P(cid:96)m−1,(cid:96)m} for some ﬁxed (cid:96)m for all
m ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Then for all pwd, pwd(cid:48) ∈ P, O is symmetric, i.e. for all j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, |Oj,pwd|= |Oj,pwd(cid:48)|.
Proof of Theorem 1. We proceed by a simple counting argument. Suppose that j  1

We also assume that for m ≤ n, |Sm| is either 0 or of a non-negligible quantity compared to the number of
iterated hashes the adversary can compute, B
k . Since users pick passwords uniformly at random, if the size
of Sm is negligible compared to B
k , then the increase in the adversary’s probability of success will also be
negligible.
Let X ⊆ P be of non-negligible size and suppose that Pui = Pt,(cid:96)i for some t  0. We thus assume for simplicity that (cid:96)i × |Ti ∩ X|= |X| for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} as long as
X is of non-negligible size. Some cases of interest are when X = P to obtain (cid:96)i × |Ti|= |P| and X = Si to
obtain (cid:96)i × |Si ∩ Ti|= |Si|.
