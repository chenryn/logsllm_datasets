User: How to use command-line tools to view indicators such as system load, CPU usage, and memory usage on the Linux operating system?
Assistant: 1. View the system load: Use the command "top" to view the operating status of the system, including CPU usage, memory usage, process information, etc. The "load average" column shows the system load. The "load average" here refers to the average value of the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. The higher the value, the greater the system load. 2. Check the CPU usage: Use the command "top" or "htop" to check the current CPU usage of the system. In the "top" command, press the "1" key on the keyboard to view the usage of each CPU core. In the "htop" command, you can view the graphical CPU usage in the "CPU" column of the interface. Using the command "mpstat", you can view the CPU usage from the perspective of each CPU core. You can also view the CPU usage by using the command "sar", which can be used by installing the "sysstat" package. 3. View memory usage: Use the command "free" to view the current memory usage of the system, including used memory, available memory, total memory, etc. Use the command "top" or "htop" to view the memory usage of processes in the system. Using the command "vmstat", you can view the system memory activity in real time, including memory usage, cache usage, etc.
