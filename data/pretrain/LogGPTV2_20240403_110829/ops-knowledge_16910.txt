**Subject: Assistance with Adding Programs Using Python Script in Windows XP**

Dear Support Team,

I am seeking assistance in adding programs, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader and other applications, to a Windows XP system using a Python script. 

Could you please provide guidance on the best approach for both installing and uninstalling these programs? 

For installation, I understand there are a couple of methods:
1. **Simple Method**: Use `subprocess.Popen` to run the installer.
2. **Automated Method**: Use `subprocess.Popen` with additional Windows-specific configurations to automate the process without requiring user interaction.

For uninstallation, similar methods can be applied:
1. **Simple Method**: Use `subprocess.Popen` to run the uninstaller.
2. **Manual Method**: Identify the files and registry entries modified by the application and revert them manually, which is more complex.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best regards,
Everest
