Assistant: Are you installing or uninstalling?
Installing:
Easy way: subprocess.Popen the installer.
Nearly-as-easy way: subprocess.Popen the installer, with some Windows hackery so that the user doesn't have to click anything.
Uninstalling:
As above.
Hard way: work out the files changed on the computer and revert them manually.
