In the context of deploying Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) using IP Anycast, the process involves setting up routing states for new subscriptions. When a subscriber joins or leaves a channel, it triggers an IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) message. This message propagates along the path until it reaches the router that is responsible for the unicast address (S) of the source. The SSM receiver then encapsulates the message, ensuring that only the relevant header fields are shown.

Figure 5 illustrates the deployment of SSM using IP Anycast. The figure shows the IP headers at different points in the network, including the IPv4 and IPv6 versions, the IP multicast root, and the IGMP types. The source (S) and group (G) addresses are also highlighted to demonstrate how the traffic is routed.

This paper aims to enable the construction and routing of a virtual network, delving into many of the lower-level details, such as topology and protocol implementation. We believe that both approaches—evolving the existing infrastructure and exploring new technologies—merit further investigation. The evolution of this technology should be seen as a gradual process, led by incumbent Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who are incentivized to undermine and eventually replace the current systems.
