User: How to set the log record of Linux system to facilitate analysis and troubleshooting?
Assistant: Setting up logging on your Linux system is key to keeping your system healthy and diagnosing problems. Here are some steps to set up logging on a Linux system: 1. Log all log events: To capture all events happening in the system, all logging levels must be activated in syslogd. This means it should include info, warnings, errors and fatal errors. 2. Record by priority: syslog adopts the concept of severity level. This means that more serious log events have higher severity levels. The logging level of log events can be set by yourself. In general, levels should be set from critical to lenient to facilitate filtering when looking for log events. 3. Classify the components in the system: Tracking down a problem often requires knowing whether the activated component is a system component or a third-party component. For best debugging results, it is recommended to group related log events into specific guards. This will help track down problems and unwanted noise. 4. Saving log events to an easily accessible file: Archiving of log events should be a regular task in local storage. After you set logging levels and organize them, log events should be saved to an easily accessible file or folder. This will help with subsequent investigations. 5. Do Live Monitoring: There are many good implementations of live monitoring these days, and you can even sync it with your own mobile phone. With custom alerts set up, you can easily get detailed information about issues that occur, even when you're not on the Ribbon. 6. Effectively manage archives: Since a large number of log events will lead to unlimited growth of files, archives must be organized regularly. In general, it is administratively beneficial to encode log events, so failure, success, and alert events should be stored separately. Because log events can be a source of sensitive information, old archive files should be deleted regularly.
