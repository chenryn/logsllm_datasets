The landing page presented us with a survey for Staples that
would supposedly reward us with a gift after completing it, clearly
not related to the Staples business in any way. These surveys are
meant to collect as much PII as possible from users and subscribe
them to potentially paid services [29].
6 DISCUSSION
In Sections 2 through 5, we presented the intuitions behind com-
bosquatting domains, how they are different than other types of
domain squatting, and quantified their current level of abuse. Specif-
ically, we found that combosquatting, despite its relative obscurity,
is more popular than typosquatting (Section 4.1). Further, we found
that combosquatters carefully crafted their domain names to ac-
count for the businesses to which the abused trademarks belong
to (Section 4.2). By cross-referencing our list of combosquatting
domains with popular blacklists, we observed that most domains
are active for several months before appearing on these lists (Sec-
tion 4.3), suggesting the presence of blind spots in the tools used
by the security industry. We identified that a few ASes were re-
sponsible for the long-term hosting of malicious combosquatting
domains (Section 4.4) and witnessed how both common botnets
and targeted APTs utilize combosquatting domains to benefit from
trademark recognition and remain hidden in plain sight. Finally, by
actively crawling 1.3 million combosquatting domains and labeling
the results, we witnessed live phishing domains and the abuse of
trademarks across all studied business categories (Section 5.1).
Given the magnitude of the combosquatting problem, in this
section, we discuss what can be done in terms of countermeasures
against combosquatting from the viewpoint of different actors in
the domain name ecosystem.
Registrants. A defense that is commonly proposed against tradi-
tional types of domain squatting are defensive registrations. In defen-
sive registrations, companies can proactively register domains that
are likely to be abused (e.g. Microsoft owns wwwmicrosoft[.]com
which redirects users to microsoft[.]com) before miscreants have a
chance of registering them. Combosquatting, however, is unique in
the sense that it lacks a generative model (discussed in Section 4.1).
As such, even for companies that can afford a large number of
defensive registrations, there is no single algorithm (like the typo
models of Wang et al. [90]) that could be used to generate a list
of combosquatting domains. Therefore, the burden of protecting
against combosquatting domains cannot rest on registrants.
At the same time, we consider it of crucial importance that
tradermark owners stop utilizing the practice of registering benign
combosquatting domains for their business. For example, the
domain paypal-prepaid[.]com belongs to PayPal and advertises the
ability to use PayPal to obtain prepaid debit cards. By using these
types of domains, companies are indirectly training users that do-
mains that contain their trademark are legitimate, making it harder
for every day users to detect the malicious ones (which, as discussed
in Section 4.1, will also have TLS certificates). Instead, trademark
owners can use filepaths (e.g. www.paypal[.]com/prepaid),
subdomains (e.g. prepaid.paypal[.]com) or even TLDs (e.g.
prepaid[.]paypal) to advertise their products without the risks
associated with the registration of combosquatting domains.
Registrars. Registrars are in the unique position to know which
domains users are trying to register before they actually register
them. Therefore, we argue that registrars could add extra logic in
their fraud-detection systems to flag domains that contain popular
trademarks (following a process similar to ours). For each flagged
domain, the registrar can either request more information from
the users who attempt to register them, or follow up on those
domains to ensure that they are not used for malicious purposes.
Even though there will always be registrars who do not wish to
implement such countermeasures and who turn a blind eye to
abuse, over time, these registrars and all the domains registered
through them could be treated by domain-intelligence systems
as “suspicious.” This unwanted labeling will translate to loss of
income forcing registrars to either adopt fraud-detection systems,
or risk further loss of business.
Third parties. Next to registrars, there exist a wide array of sys-
tems [18–20, 41–43] which analyze newly registered domains in
an attempt to discover abusive ones before they are weaponized.
Similar to the extra step for registrars, we argue that searching for
the presence of popular trademarks in newly registered domains
can be an extra source of signal that can be exploited to identify
malicious registrations.
7 RELATED WORK
DNS Abuse. Weimer et al. [91] proposed collecting passive DNS
data for security analysis. Since then, researchers have used
passive DNS data to build domain name reputation systems
using statistical modeling methods to detect abuse on the
Internet [18–20, 25, 59, 74, 77, 92]. More recently, Lever et al. [57]
used passive DNS to identify potential domain ownership changes.
Hao et al. [43] uses only registration features to build domain
reputation system. Liu et al. [58] revealed that dangling DNS
records pointing to invalid resources can be easily manipulated
for domain highjacking. Chen et al. [28] used passive DNS data to
estimate the financial abuse of advertising ecosystem by a large
botnet.

ting in general. Jakobsson et al. [46, 47] proposed techniques for
identifying typosquatting and discovered that websites in cate-
gories with higher PPC ad prices face more typosquatting regis-
trations. Wang et al. [90] proposed models for the generation of
typosquatting domains from authoritative ones. Agten et al. [13]
studied typosquatting using crawled data over a period of seven
months finding, among others, that few trademark owners protect
themselves by defensively registering typosquatting domains. In
addition to typosquatting, Nikiforakis et al. [70] quantify the extent
to which attackers are leveraging bitsquatting [31], where random
bit-errors occurring in the memory of commodity hardware can
redirect Internet traffic to attacker-controlled domains. Their ex-
periments show that new bitsquatting domains are registered daily
and monetized through ads, affiliate programs and even malware
installations. The authors later performed a measurement of the
so-called “soundsquatting”, where attackers abuse homophones to
attract users and confuse text-to-speech systems [69].
The only work on combosquatting other than this paper is a
brief 2008 industry whitepaper [1]. Starting with 30 trademarks
and up to 50 generic keywords the authors constructed possible
combosquatting domains and then attempted to get traffic data
for the 500 domains that were registered. The authors found that
most sites were filled with ads, thereby abusing the popularity of
trademarks and diluting their revenue. Motivated by the findings
of that nine-year-old whitepaper, we performed the experiments
described in this paper finding millions of combosquatting domains
and analyzing registration and abuse trends over almost six years.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study a type of domain squatting termed “com-
bosquatting,” which has yet to be extensively studied by the se-
curity community. By registering domains that include popular
trademarks (e.g., paypal-members[.]com), attackers are able to
capitalize on a trademark’s recognition to perform social engineer-
ing, phishing, affiliate abuse, trademark abuse, and even targeted
attacks. We performed the first large-scale, empirical study of com-
bosquatting using 468 billion DNS records from both active and
passive DNS datasets, which were collected over an almost six year
time period. Lexical analysis of combosquatting domains revealed
that, while there is an almost infinite pool of potential combosquat-
ting domains, most instances add only a single token to the original
combosquatted domain. Furthermore, the chosen tokens were often
specifically targeted to a particular business category. These results
can help brands limit the potential search space for combosquatting
domains. Additionally, our results show that most combosquatting
domains were not remediated for extended periods of times—up
to 1,000 days in many cases. Furthermore, many instances of com-
bosquatting abuse were seen active significantly before they were
discovered by public blacklists or malware feeds. Consequently,
our findings suggests that current protections do not do a good
job at addressing the threat of combosquatting. This is particularly
concerning because our results also show that combosquatting is be-
coming more prevalent year over year. Lastly, we found numerous
instances of combosquatting abuse in the real world by crawling
1.3 million combosquatting domains and manually analyzing the
results. Based on our findings we discuss the role of different parties
in the domain name ecosystem and how each party can help tackle
the overall combosquatting problem. Ultimately, our results suggest
that combosquatting is a real and growing threat, and the security
community needs to develop better protections to defend against
it.
