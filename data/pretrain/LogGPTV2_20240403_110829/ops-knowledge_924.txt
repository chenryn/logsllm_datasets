### Question:
How can I limit concurrent SSH sessions on a per-user basis? I am trying to prevent my SSH users from having more than one session open at a time. My system is running Ubuntu 11.10.

### Attempted Solution:
I thought the setting should be in `/etc/security/limits.conf`, where I added the following line:

```plaintext
betatest hard maxlogins 1
```

However, this has no effect, and I can still log in multiple times using the `betatest` user account from different machines.

### Configuration Details:
- The `sshd_config` file is configured to use PAM.
- Both the `login` and `sshd` configurations in `/etc/pam.d` include the following line:

```plaintext
session    required   pam_limits.so
```

### Additional Information:
From the `pam_limits` man page (at least on RHEL/CentOS), it seems that adding a `maxlogins` parameter for the desired user(s) should work, but I haven't tested it. Here are the relevant details from the man page:

#### NAME
`pam_limits - PAM module to limit resources`

#### SYNOPSIS
```plaintext
pam_limits.so [change_uid] [conf=/path/to/limits.conf] [debug] [utmp_early] [noaudit]
```

#### DESCRIPTION
The `pam_limits` PAM module sets limits on the system resources that can be obtained in a user session. Users with `uid=0` (root) are also affected by these limits.

By default, limits are taken from the `/etc/security/limits.conf` configuration file. Additionally, individual `.conf` files from the `/etc/security/limits.d/` directory are read.

### Request for Help:
If anyone knows how to restrict concurrent SSH sessions on a per-user basis, I would greatly appreciate the assistance.

### Optimized Answer:
To limit concurrent SSH sessions on a per-user basis in Ubuntu 11.10, you can use the `Match` directive in the `sshd_config` file along with the `MaxSessions` option. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Edit the `sshd_config` File:**
   Open the `sshd_config` file in a text editor with root privileges:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. **Add the `Match` Directive:**
   Add the following lines to the `sshd_config` file to limit the number of concurrent sessions for the `betatest` user to 1:

   ```plaintext
   Match User betatest
       MaxSessions 1
   ```

3. **Save and Exit:**
   Save the changes and exit the text editor.

4. **Restart the SSH Service:**
   Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:
   ```sh
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```

### Explanation:
- **`Match User betatest`**: This directive targets the `betatest` user specifically.
- **`MaxSessions 1`**: This option limits the number of concurrent sessions for the `betatest` user to 1.

### Additional Notes:
- The `pam_limits` module and the `maxlogins` setting in `/etc/security/limits.conf` are typically used to limit the number of logins, but they may not always work as expected for limiting concurrent SSH sessions. The `MaxSessions` option in `sshd_config` is more reliable for this purpose.
- If you need to apply this restriction to multiple users, you can add multiple `Match` blocks or use a group to manage the users.

This approach should effectively limit the number of concurrent SSH sessions for the `betatest` user.
