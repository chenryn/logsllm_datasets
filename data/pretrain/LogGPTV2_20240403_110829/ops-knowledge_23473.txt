User: How to set IP address and DNS server on Red Hat Linux system?
Assistant: To set the IP address and DNS server, follow these steps: 1. Go to Terminal and log in as root. 2. Open the network configuration file: `vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`. If your system has multiple network interfaces, select the correct one (eg ifcfg-eth1). 3. In the file, locate the following lines and update them to match your network configuration: ``` BOOTPROTO=static IPADDR=<your_IP_address> NETMASK=<your_netmask> GATEWAY=<your_gateway_IP_address> DNS1=<your_primary_DNS_address> DNS2=<your_secondary_DNS_address> > ``` Note: If you do not know your IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS server, please contact your network administrator for details. 4. Save the changes and close the file. 5. Restart the network service for the changes to take effect: `systemctl restart network.service` 6. Check that your new network configuration is working: `ping <any_website>`. If all is well, you should be able to ping the website. The above are the steps to set the IP address and DNS server on the Red Hat Linux system.
