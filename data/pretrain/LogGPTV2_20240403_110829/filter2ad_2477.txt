## Abstract
User studies that investigate how human traits influence responses to cybersecurity situations often rely on self-reported surveys. However, these surveys can be biased by factors such as peer perception, socially desirable responding, and responder bias, leading to results that do not accurately reflect real-world behavior. To address these issues, we developed PsychoRithm, a software system that presents realistic security scenarios to participants and records their real-time reactions. This paper describes the architecture of PsychoRithm, the design choices made, and the challenges encountered during its development.

## 1. Introduction
To design effective security tools tailored to end users, it is essential to understand how users perceive cybersecurity risks, what factors influence their decisions, and the trade-offs they make. Many studies have attempted to answer these questions, but as noted by Howe et al. [2], most relied on self-reported surveys, which are prone to biases. These authors suggested that experiments based on simulations, where participants are placed in real situations and monitored, could reduce such biases and provide more accurate insights into user behavior.

Based on this hypothesis, we developed PsychoRithm, a software system that simulates common computer security scenarios to study human behavior in situ. PsychoRithm creates an environment that mimics typical home computer usage, such as emailing, web browsing, social networking, and online shopping. The system records user responses, including clicks and response times, and stores the data securely. Currently, PsychoRithm focuses on two specific traits: self-efficacy (an individual's confidence in performing security tasks) and cues to action (responses to external triggers). This work discusses the design of PsychoRithm, outlining major design choices and challenges in building the system for a Windows desktop environment.

## 2. Major Design Decisions
### Physical Setup
Our first decision was to use Microsoft Windows, a widely used platform for home computer users. We also needed a system that could be easily moved to different locations, such as senior centers, to conduct experiments. To avoid the risk of infecting study machines and to simplify setup, we created a fully simulated environment that mimics real-world cyber interactions without altering the underlying operating system.

### Data Storage
Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations require secure and safe storage of subject data. Additionally, to accommodate multiple simultaneous participants, we created a secure remote server to host aspects of the experimental environment and store data. The desktop-side software runs in kiosk mode to prevent subjects from accessing system controls.

### Scenarios
PsychoRithm supports three scenarios:
1. **Antivirus Software Installation:** Measures self-efficacy through the steps taken and time spent installing and configuring antivirus software. Cues to action are evaluated based on the appearance of the software, quality of web pages, and provided details.
2. **Phishing Attacks via Social Media (Twitter):** Evaluates self-efficacy and response to phishing attempts.
3. **Phishing Attacks via Email:** Similar to the second scenario, but conducted via email.

## 3. System Architecture
PsychoRithm operates as a kiosk, with major components and their interactions shown in Figure 1. The system generates a Simulated Local Environment on the desktop, while services like social media and email are provided from a separate server. The local environment includes a Desktop application, Taskbar, Web-browser, and File-Browser. The Desktop manages application icons and user validation, while the Taskbar provides easy access to open applications. The Web-browser and File-Browser simulate real-world interactions, such as downloading files and browsing websites.

## 4. Challenges
### Desktop and Taskbar
Creating a realistic desktop and taskbar involved implementing a topmost Win32 ToolWindow and a custom opaque taskbar. Initial attempts to create a transparent window over the Windows taskbar were slow and exposed system controls, so we implemented our own taskbar to manage applications.

### Browsing Experience
We used Firefox version 34.0.5, disabling certain features and introducing a custom PHP stub to emulate URL bars and navigation. All widgets were disabled using a Firefox extension, and the main Firefox window was hidden behind the PsychoRithm Desktop to prevent exposure to system controls.

## 5. Discussion and Future Work
This paper describes the design of PsychoRithm, a software platform for studying human behavior related to cybersecurity. We highlighted the design challenges and demonstrated the system's capability to study two characteristics of home computer users in three security scenarios. PsychoRithm can be adapted for other scenarios and subject characteristics.
