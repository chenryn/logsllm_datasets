##### CIRT Playbook Battle Card: **GSPBC-1071 - Exfiltration - Exfiltration Over Web Services**
**(P) Preparation**
1.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.  Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.  Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.  Create network segmentation
5.  Log traffic between network segments
6.  Incorporate threat intelligence
7.  Perform routine inspections of asset backups
8.  Conduct phishing simulations
9.  Conduct user security awareness training
10.  Conduct response training (this PBC)
11.  Use a data loss prevention (DLP) strategy to categorize sensitive data, identify data formats indicative of personal identifiable information (PII), and restrict exfiltration of sensitive data \[7\]
12.  Restrict the use of unnecessary web services, block certain websites and ability to download. Disable Javascript \[8\]
**(I) Identification**
1.  Monitor for:  
    a. Command executions that are using a legitimate web service to exfiltrate data instead of performing their intended purpose \[2\]  
    b. Legitimate web services that are attempting to access data instead of performing their intended purpose \[3\]  
    c. New network connections to services associated with abnormal or non-browser processes \[4\]  
    d. Packets and communications that do not follow their expected protocol standards \[5\]  
    e. Abnormal traffic flow of data \[6\]
2.  Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.  Routinely check firewall, IDS, IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity
**(C) Containment**
1.  Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.  Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.  Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.  Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.  Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.  Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.  Fortify non-impacted critical assets
**(E) Eradication**
1.  Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.  Reset any compromised passwords
4.  Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack profile
5.  Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack profile PRIOR to system recovery
6.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
**(R) Recovery**
1.  Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
2.  Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.  Resolve any related security incidents
4.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup
**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**
1.  Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.  Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.  Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.  Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.  Avoid opening email and attachments from unfamiliar senders
6.  Avoid opening email attachments from senders that do not normally include attachments
7.  Pay attention to unusual behavior exhibited by trusted parties
8.  Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities
