to act as the anchor and eavesdropper devices. Without loss
of generality, the routers utilize standardized waveforms and
can be considered as a substitute for any other Wi-Fi device.
Further, the MIMO operation yields a total of 9 spatial wireless
channels in parallel from a single anchor device. Thus, the
adversary takes advantage of spatial diversity [8], i. e., multiple
different wireless channels, each containing information on the
target area, to improve the adversarial motion detection [6].
Another important aspect is the transmission rate of the
anchor devices. As outlined in [37], typical Wi-Fi devices
for use in living spaces transmit at 3 to 257 packets/sec
during active operation. Likewise, in our setup, the anchors
transmit at approx. 70 packets/sec. Thus, we constantly allow
the adversary to observe the target area, even with substantial
oversampling since human motion is rather slow when sam-
pled at 70 packets/sec. Further, the wireless trafﬁc transmitted
by our anchor devices does not carry meaningful application-
driven data. However, this does not play a role for the attack
Even under these clearly beneﬁcial conditions for the ad-
versary, IRShield almost completely defeats the scheme from
the literature [37]. Assuming the defense is known, we have
also shown that the adversary in turn can adapt the threshold
to restore some detection capabilities, albeit with strongly
reduced success. This residual detectability is due to motion
with very strong impact, e. g., within the LOS or close to the
anchor, being stronger than the IRShield signal variation.
B. IRS Deployment
The outlined probabilistic IRS conﬁguration algorithm re-
alizes channel obfuscation in a plug-and-play manner inde-
pendently of anchor devices. Since the IRS directly interacts
with wireless signals as they propagate, no integration efforts
are required once the surface is deployed in proximity to an
anchor device. While we used a host computer to implement
Algorithm 1,
the IRS’ on-board microcontroller can also
directly implement the algorithm, allowing fully stand-alone
operation. Note that, however, the randomized IRS conﬁgura-
tions are sub-optimal as they do not maximize the IRS impact,
especially for higher distances between the IRS and the anchor
devices. To this end, we emphasize that IRSs are being
considered for future 6G wireless communication systems with
potential for integration into walls and furniture [31]. Thus, the
assumption of IRS deployments in proximity to anchor devices
indeed is well justiﬁed.
The effectiveness of channel obfuscation is rooted in the
used IRS hardware. The IRS is commonly considered as low-
complexity device that can be built at low cost, using standard
PCB technology. The IRS deployed in our experiments is a
prototypical device which leaves room for hardware improve-
ments. For instance, currently only 5 GHz frequency bands are
covered and signals are reﬂected with a certain loss. Thus, our
results may be further improved as the technology evolves.
C. Bypassing IRShield
Advanced adversaries may attempt to remove or suppress
the effect of IRShield. By using antenna arrays for beam-
forming (or directional antennas), signal components can be
distinguished in the angular domain. However, for IRShield,
this is not possible due to the proximity of the IRS to
the anchor,
the IRS signals emanate from the same
direction as the direct signals. Further, as indicated by our
experimental results, it appears that the IRS yields channel
variation in all directions. Another option would be time-
domain analysis where individual multipath signal components
are distinguishable by their respective time of arrival at the
i.e.,

bandwidth for this approach to work properly (time resolution
scales inversely with bandwidth), the IRShield signals further
encounter similar delay spreads compared to the rest of the
propagation environment.
Without changing signal domains, adversaries could also
strive to leverage the speciﬁc behavior of the IRS conﬁg-
uration algorithm. For instance, it would be conceivable to
combine consecutive channel measurements before and after
the inversion step of Algorithm 1. Due to the sign change, the
IRS contribution would vanish. In practice, the bottleneck to
this approach are stable phase-coherent channel measurements
over time which are difﬁcult to obtain due to the asynchronous
distant transmitter and receiver. In fact, signal phase of com-
modity radios faces various severe random distortions [19].
Still, an alternative algorithm design could replace the inver-
sion by a second random step, e. g., where only a certain
fraction of randomly selected elements is ﬂipped.
D. Further Applications of IRShield
As Wi-Fi devices are particularly widespread in private and
public spaces, we used IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi to conﬁrm the
potential of IRS for channel obfuscation. However, in some
cases, an adversary may leverage other wireless standards for
sensing. Since the IRS operates directly on the physical layer
and affects the wireless channel, it is independent of particular
waveforms or standards. Thus, IRShield generally is not tied
to Wi-Fi. The experimental veriﬁcation of IRShield for other
wireless standards is left for future work.
We examined channel obfuscation as a countermeasure
particularly geared towards adversarial (human) motion de-
tection. However, beyond that, applications such as gesture
recognition, identiﬁcation of individuals, imaging, vital sign
monitoring, or keystroke recognition [19] have been reported
and can have far-reaching privacy implications. We believe
that the intricate signal processing methods employed for these
applications could be susceptible against signal variations in-
duced by the IRS. Therefore, IRShield may also protect against
other classes of wireless sensing, which can be conﬁrmed
through further experimentation.
Finally, we would like to point out that the IRS could also
be used to corrupt legitimate wireless sensing applications,
e. g., for motion-based intrusion detection [15]. However, such
scenarios are beyond the scope of this work.
E. Limitations
IRShield signiﬁcantly hampers adversarial motion detection
but cannot fully prevent it in some cases. As our results show
(see Fig. 23 in Appendix C), this effect occurs when motion
takes place close to anchors and within the LOS. That is, en-
vironmental variation can cause RF signal ﬂuctuation which is
stronger than IRS-induced signal variation, yielding a residual
detectability. This limitation of IRShield is rooted in the IRS’
ﬁnite impact on the signal propagation: The IRS is purely
passive, i. e., it reﬂects signals but cannot apply ampliﬁcation.
Further, the IRS surface conﬁguration requires optimization to
achieve maximum signal power – a requirement not met by
the randomized surface conﬁgurations of IRShield. To enhance
the impact, the defender could increase the IRS size or reduce
the distance to anchors. Further, at the cost of losing device
independence, IRShield could also cooperate with legitimate
devices to optimize IRS conﬁgurations. Another simpler op-
tion for the defender is strategic anchor placement. As we
have shown, anchor devices close to the eavesdropper are less
sensitive against motion. By taking advantage of limited public
accessibility of the target area, the defender can effectively
prevent motion to take place within the eavesdropper’s LOS to
further diminish the adversary’s success. Finally, the discussed
residual detectability is speciﬁc to motion sensing. For other
wireless sensing tasks based on weaker signal features, the
relative impact of IRShield would rise.
Another limitation of IRShield is its undirected effect that
would interfere with legitimate wireless sensing applications.
To resolve this, IRShield would need to interact with the
legitimate parties, i. e., to estimate the IRS channels [36] and
communicate IRS conﬁgurations. Based on this information,
a legitimate receiver could attempt to remove the effect of
IRShield.
F. Future Work
Our ﬁndings may serve as a starting point for future work
e. g.,
recent Wi-Fi devices,
that could investigate, for instance, the following aspects.
Optimization of IRS conﬁguration. We proposed a proba-
bilistic IRS conﬁguration algorithm for IRShield. While we
already obtained satisfactory results, we believe that there is
still room for improvements, e. g., by randomizing state tran-
sitions of the algorithm or by switching between predeﬁned
patterns. Currently, IRShield operates independently of the
anchor device. The next logical step would be to incorporate
information from the anchor devices and accordingly, adjust
the IRS, e. g., by analyzing channel estimates.
Beamforming. More
for
IEEE 802.11ac, utilize beamforming. Thus, wireless signals
are no longer transmitted to all directions (including the eaves-
dropper) but rather directed towards the intended receiver.
Hence, an eavesdropper will receive weaker signals [5] which
likely reduces the adversarial sensing capabilities. More work
is required to investigate whether beamforming in conjunction
with IRShield further degrades the adversary’s capabilities.
Further testing and adversary strategies. We showed that
IRShield defeats existing adversarial motion-detection strate-
gies in an exemplary test scenario. However, a powerful
adversary may use multiple receivers or apply different signal
processing and statistical classiﬁcation methods. Future work
should further investigate the performance in more elaborate
settings, e. g., with more anchor devices, varying room sizes,
multiple rooms, and motion of multiple users.
Legitimate sensing. The coexistence of IRShield and le-
gitimate wireless sensing applications could also be further
explored. In particular, IRShield is likely to affect legitimate
sensing capabilities. Therefore,
it would be interesting to

explore solutions to leave authorized parties unaffected or
allow them to remove the effect of IRShield.
VII. RELATED WORK
In this section, we summarize relevant literature on privacy
violations caused by snifﬁng wireless devices and report
related work on wireless sensing. We also outline how our
work differs from previous proposals for countermeasures.
With a particular
focus on privacy violations, Baner-
jee et al. [6] and Zhu et al. [37] studied Wi-Fi-based physical-
layer attacks to infer human motion from channel observations
by eavesdropping packets. In both papers, the authors utilized
a sliding-window standard deviation or variance as a measure
of temporal channel variation. While [6] focused on detecting
LOS crossings, [37] pursues monitoring of entire environments
for motion, including differentiation of motion in speciﬁc parts
of the target environment. The authors of [6] employed Wi-Fi
routers with MIMO functionality to implement
the attack
and [37] presented a smartphone-based implementation.
To counteract unauthorized wireless sensing, different types
of countermeasures have been considered. Qiao et al. proposed
PhyCloak [22], a full-duplex relay node to introduce chan-
nel variation. Wijewardena et al. [29] put forward a game-
theoretic framework to trade the privacy loss against the qual-
ity of service of the wireless communication. Jiao et al. [12]
presented an extension of the Wi-Fi transmitter module of
openwiﬁ which is a full-stack software-deﬁned radio Wi-Fi
implementation [11]. Using a reconﬁgurable digital ﬁlter, an
artiﬁcial channel response is imposed on transmitted signals to
disguise the actual environment-dependent channel response.
Apart from motion sensing, there is a large body of work on
Wi-Fi sensing applications as surveyed by Ma et al. [19]. For
instance, Wi-Fi signals have been employed for gesture recog-
nition [2], identiﬁcation of individuals [14], imaging [10], vital
sign monitoring [16], or keystroke recognition [4]. Shifting
the scope of wireless sensing, Camurati et al. [7] have shown
that RF signals from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chipsets can be
utilized for side-channel attacks against on-chip cryptographic
hardware implementations from rather large distances.
Differentiation from previous work. A conceptually closely
related work is PhyCloak introduced by Qiao et al. [22].
Using a full-duplex radio, legitimate RF signals are received
and re-transmitted while applying randomized signal changes
to hamper adversarial sensing. However, full-duplex requires
specialized and highly complex radio hardware to achieve self-
interference cancellation in order to allow for simultaneously
receiving and transmitting on the same frequency. Another
proposal by Yao et al. [33] also receives and re-transmits le-
gitimate signals but uses full-duplex by means of a directional
transmit antenna. To introduce randomized changes to the
adversarial observations, however, the setup employs several
moving parts, e. g., a motor to rotate the antenna and a fast fan.
While IRShield follows the general receive-and-re-transmit
rationale, our approach works entirely different. Crucially, we
utilize an IRS to unify reception, signal alteration, and re-
transmission of signals into digitally adjustable reﬂection. In
contrast to [22] and [33], the IRS is inherently capable of
full-duplex operation and does not require moving parts.
Along with their attack implementation, Zhu et al. [37]
proposed a countermeasure based on a fake access point to
inject cover packets to mimic legitimate trafﬁc. As a result,
the eavesdropper observes a mix of packets transmitted by the
victim devices and the fake access point, thus reducing the
adversarial sensing capability. We believe the adversary can
easily defeat this strategy since the channel from the fake
access point is clearly distinguishable due to the location-
dependence of wireless channels [8]. Another interesting ap-
proach put forward by Wijewardena et al. [29] is based on
strategically randomizing transmit power or turning off devices
completely. However, both strategies are based on changing
the allocation of the channel and therefore, face a trade-off
between the quality of service of wireless communication and
reduction of adversarial sensing capabilities. We emphasize
that IRShield rather changes the wireless channel itself instead
of its allocation. Moreover, IRShield is independent of the
existing equipment, i. e., it neither requires adjustments of
transmit power or timing, nor does it need to be matched to
the legitimate signals.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced and experimentally examined
IRShield as a plug-and-play countermeasure against adversar-
ial motion detection from passive eavesdropping of wireless
signals. By deploying an IRS, we partly randomize the wire-
less propagation environment to introduce random variations
which obfuscate the adversary’s signal observations. To this
end, we presented an extensive experimental
investigation
to characterize channel obfuscation. Beginning with human
motion detection, we have shown that our scheme successfully
diminishes the adversary’s success. We then systematically
studied spatial aspects of the attack and the countermeasure
and discussed how the adversary could adapt to the defense.
Notably, we found that our scheme lowered detection rates
to 5 % or less for a state-of-the-art attack. In certain cases,
it renders motion detection largely infeasible, regardless of
the adversary strategy. Furthermore, we investigated IRS pa-
rameters such as size, distance, and orientation and showed
that IRShield does not affect
the wireless communication
performance.
