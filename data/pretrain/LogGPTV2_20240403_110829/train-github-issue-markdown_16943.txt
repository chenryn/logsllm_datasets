### Repro steps
I was watching a video on youtube when I noticed the new video hover features
which were not there on the 15th of January 2022.  
This then led me to the react dev tools which I noticed had turned blue, never
had before. wanted to know of this is a bug or not.  
I have restarted my computer and browser severally.
