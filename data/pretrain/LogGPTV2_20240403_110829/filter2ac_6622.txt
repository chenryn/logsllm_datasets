**Description:**
Utilize Mobile Device Management (MDM) to restrict users from installing or approving kernel extensions. Ensure that all approved kernel extensions comply with the policies outlined in `com.apple.syspolicy.kernel-extension-policy`.[23][24]

This approach helps in maintaining a secure and controlled environment by preventing unauthorized modifications to the system's kernel, which could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.
