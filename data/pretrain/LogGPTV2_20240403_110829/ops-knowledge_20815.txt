### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:11 to 18:06:16 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues and events within a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step breakdown and summary:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component repeatedly fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failure duration increases from 74 seconds at 18:06:11 to 78 seconds at 18:06:15. Each failure is followed by a message indicating that a retry will be attempted shortly.

2. **Resource Manager (RM) Connection Issues:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030` multiple times. The connection attempts are logged at 18:06:11, 18:06:14, and 18:06:16. Each attempt logs a retry policy with a maximum of 10 retries and a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds.
   - An error in contacting the RM is also logged at 18:06:11 and 18:06:14, indicating a persistent issue with the RM communication.

3. **Address Changes:**
   - Multiple address changes are detected for the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` components. The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000` or `msra-sa-41:8030`. These changes are logged at 18:06:12, 18:06:13, 18:06:14, and 18:06:15.

4. **Task Attempt Progress:**
   - Progress updates for two `TaskAttempts` are logged:
     - `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` has a progress of 0.37551183 at 18:06:12 and 18:06:15.
     - `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0` has a progress of 0.38137424 at 18:06:12 and 18:06:15.

### Key Observations
- **Lease Renewal:** The lease renewal failures are consistent and increasing in duration, suggesting a potential issue with the DFS client or the HDFS NameNode.
- **RM Communication:** The repeated failures to connect to the RM and the errors indicate a problem with the RM service or network connectivity.
- **Address Changes:** The frequent address changes might be due to network instability or configuration changes, which could be contributing to the other issues.
- **Task Attempts:** The task attempts are progressing, but the overall system health is compromised by the lease and RM issues.

### Recommendations
- Investigate the cause of the lease renewal failures and ensure the DFS client and NameNode are functioning correctly.
- Check the status and availability of the Resource Manager and verify network connectivity.
- Review the network configuration to understand the frequent address changes and ensure stable network settings.

By addressing these issues, the system's stability and performance can be improved.
