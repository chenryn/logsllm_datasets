### 5.2 Evaluation Results

#### Connectivity
We begin by demonstrating the effectiveness of REIN in improving network reliability through enhanced connectivity. Network reliability is measured by the link connectivities within the network. A network with low link connectivity is less reliable. For instance, during the Sprint incident, the network was partitioned due to links with a connectivity of 2. Due to the lack of SRLG data, we assume all links, both intradomain and interdomain, belong to their own and distinct SRLGs.

**Figure 4** shows the link connectivity of the 8 network topologies listed in Table 2. The y-axis represents the percentage of links with low connectivity (i.e., connectivity ≤ 2). Two key observations are:

1. **Without Interdomain Bypass Paths:**
   - All evaluated networks have at least 19% of links with connectivity ≤ 2.
   - Some networks can have up to nearly 60% of such links.
   - The Sprint network has 29% of links with low connectivity, making it susceptible to partitioning.
   - Topologies inferred by Rocketfuel may have missing links, which, if added, could reduce the percentage of low-connectivity links. However, even for the Abilene and US-ISP topologies, which have no inference errors, the percentage of low-connectivity links remains significant. Specifically, for the Abilene topology, 11 out of the 14 links have a connectivity of 2.

2. **With Interdomain Bypass Paths:**
   - Interdomain bypass paths significantly reduce the percentage of links with low connectivity.
   - Using the algorithm presented in Section 4.2, we select interdomain bypass paths to improve link connectivity to at least 3, assuming a same-city peering relationship at PoP level, without using more than 7 interdomain bypass paths.
   - REIN has substantially reduced the percentage of links with low connectivity. For example:
     - With just 3 paths from US-ISP, REIN has completely eliminated any link with connectivity < 3 in Abilene.
     - With 5 paths from two neighboring networks, REIN has reduced the percentage of Sprint from 29% to 8%.
     - With 5 paths from three neighboring networks, REIN has reduced the percentage of US-ISP by a factor of 5 (exact numbers not shown due to privacy concerns).

#### Detailed Analysis
**Figure 5: Time Series Plots of Bottleneck Link Traffic Intensity: Abilene Traces, One-Link Failure Scenarios.**

**Figure 6: Time Series Plots of Bottleneck Traffic Intensity: Abilene Traces, Two-Link Failure Scenarios.**

**Abilene:**
- We report results using Abilene, evaluating two categories of failure scenarios: single-link failures and two-link failures.
- For each interval, we enumerate each scenario and report the worst-case traffic intensity on the bottleneck link.
- We selected two days for analysis: one with high traffic demand (August 31, 2004) and one with relatively low traffic demand (September 3, 2004).

**Single-Link Failure Scenarios:**
- Without REIN, CSPF is less efficient in handling failures, driving traffic demand to the bottleneck link to nearly 300% of its capacity, three times that of robust path-based TE/FRR.
- A closer examination of the Abilene topology reveals a 2.5 Gbps link between Atlanta and Indianapolis, while the rest are 10 Gbps. When a link fails, CSPF diverts a large amount of traffic to the low-bandwidth link, causing severe congestion.
- Our robust path-based TE/FRR performs well under all single-link failure scenarios, close to optimal for both days. Thus, with an effective TE/FRR algorithm, there may be no need for interdomain bypass paths under single-link failure scenarios.

**Two-Link Failure Scenarios:**
- We stress the Abilene network with two-link failures, excluding scenarios that partition the network.
- **Figure 6** shows the results. On August 31, 2004, after interval 208, our robust path-based TE/FRR drives traffic demand to almost 3.5 times the bottleneck link capacity.
- Even the optimal routing using intradomain links drives traffic demand to almost 3 times the bottleneck link capacity, making it impossible for any fast rerouting algorithm to recover without significantly reduced throughput.

**Effectiveness of REIN:**
- **Figure 6** also demonstrates the effectiveness of REIN. It shows network performance when 10 interdomain bypass paths selected by our path selection algorithm are added. These 10 paths include the 3 needed for connectivity and 7 additional paths for fast rerouting.
- The performance of our robust path-based TE/FRR with additional interdomain bypass paths is labeled as REIN. On August 31, 2004, REIN significantly improves network performance under severe failure scenarios.
