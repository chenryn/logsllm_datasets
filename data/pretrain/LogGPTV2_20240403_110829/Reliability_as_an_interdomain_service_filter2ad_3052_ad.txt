metric is also referred to as maximum link utilization (MLU) in the
literature.
5.2 Evaluation Results
Connectivity: We start with demonstrating the effectiveness of
REIN by improving the reliability of networks through connectivity
improvement. We measure the reliability of an network by the link
connectivities of the links in its network; for deﬁnition and algo-
rithm on link connectivity see Section 4.2. An network with links
with low link connectivity is less reliable. For example, during the
aforementioned Sprint incident, the Sprint network is partitioned
due to the existence of links with link connectivity 2. Due to the
lack of SRLG data, we assume all links, both intradomain and in-
terdomain, belong to their own and distinct SRLGs.
Figure 4 shows the link connectivity of the 8 network topologies
shown in Table 2. The y-axis is the percentage of links with low
connectivity (i.e., connectivity less than or equal to 2). We make
two observations. First, without interdomain bypass paths, all eval-
uated networks have at least 19% links with link connectivity less
than or equal to 2. Some can be as high as close to 60%. The
percentage for the Sprint network is 29%. Thus, it is not totally
surprising that the network could partition. Note that the topolo-
gies inferred by Rocketfuel may have missing links, and adding
missing links may reduce the percentage of links with low connec-
tivity. However, for the Abilene and US-ISP topologies, both with
no inference errors, the percentage of low connectivity links is still
non-negligible. Speciﬁcally, for the Abilene topology, 11 out of the
14 links have connectivity 2.
Second, interdomain bypass paths signiﬁcantly reduce the per-
centage of links with low connectivity. Using the algorithm pre-
sented in Section 4.2, for each topology, we select interdomain by-
pass paths so that the link connectivity is improved to at least 3,
if possible, assuming a same-city peering relationship at PoP level,
without using more than 7 interdomain bypass paths. From Fig-
ure 4, we observe that, REIN has substantially reduced the percent-
age of links with low connectivity. For example, with just 3 paths
from US-ISP, REIN has completely eliminated from Abilene any
link with connectivity less than 3; with 5 paths from two neigh-
boring networks, REIN has reduced the percentage of Sprint from
29% to 8%; with 5 paths from three neighboring networks, REIN
has reduced the percentage of US-ISP by a factor of 5 (exact num-
bers are not shown in the ﬁgure due to privacy concerns). Detailed

topologies and trafﬁc traces.
Abilene: First, we report the results using Abilene. We evaluate
two categories of failure scenarios: single-link failure scenarios,
and two-link failure scenarios. For these two categories, for each
interval, we enumerate each scenario in the category and report
the worst-case trafﬁc intensity on the bottleneck link. We select
two days to show traces: one with high trafﬁc demand (August
31, 2004) and one with relatively low trafﬁc demand (September 3,
2004).
We ﬁrst introduce single-link failure scenarios without using REIN.
investigation shows that the reason we can improve connectivity
with a small number of interdomain bypass paths is that the topolo-
gies of most IP networks have several well connected components,
between which the connecting links are scarce. This is a good opti-
mization target for connectivity improvements, and also the reason
for the substantial gain with only a few extra paths added. Note that
although it is also possible for an IP network to install additional
physical links at these locations by itself to improve connectivity,
the cost can be much higher.
Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of REIN using real Internet
Figure 5 shows the results. It is clear that CSPF is less efﬁcient in
dealing with failures in the network, as there are single-link failure
scenarios where CSPF can drive trafﬁc demand to the bottleneck
link to be as high as nearly 300% link capacity, and three times that
of robust path-based TE/FRR. A closer examination of the Abilene
topology shows a 2.5 Gbps link between Atlanta and Indianapo-
lis, whereas the rest of the links are 10 Gbps. When a link fails,
CSPF diverts a large amount of trafﬁc into the low-bandwidth link,
creating severe congestion. For ease of presentation, we will not
show the performance of CSPF under two-link failure scenarios.
As a comparison, our robust path-based TE/FRR performs well un-
der all single-link failure scenarios, being close to optimal for both
days. Thus, with an effective TE/FRR algorithm such as the robust
path-based TE/FRR, there may not be a need to introduce interdo-
main bypass paths under single link failure scenarios.
Now we stress the Abilene network with two-link failures. We
do not include two-link failure scenarios which may partition the
network. Figure 6 shows the results. On August 31, 2004, after in-
terval 208, there are failure scenarios where our robust path-based
TE/FRR drives the trafﬁc demand to be almost 3.5 times the bot-
tleneck link capacity. However, the ﬁgure also shows that at these
severe failure scenarios, even the optimal routing using intradomain
links will drive the trafﬁc demand to be almost 3 times bottleneck
link capacity, leaving it impossible for any fast rerouting algorithm
to recover without signiﬁcantly reduced throughput.
Figure 6 also shows the effectiveness of REIN. Speciﬁcally, it
shows network performance when the 10 interdomain bypass paths
selected by our path selection algorithm are added. These 10 paths
include both the 3 needed for connectivity and additional 7 for fast
rerouting. The performance of our robust path-based TE/FRR with
additional interdomain bypass paths is labeled as REIN. On August
