User: So I have a python script that relies on a couple modules. Specifically pexpect and pyinoitify. I know you can compile a python script into a .exe in windows, but is there something relatively equivalent in linux? I don't care about it being a binary, I'd just like to be able to distribute my script without requiring the separate installation of pexpect and pyinotify. Is that possible/worthwhile?
Assistant: In linux, try to avoid such things. Most package managers handle dependencies quite fine, just distribute your script and tell what dependencies it needs.
