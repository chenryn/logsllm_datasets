### Bug Report: ec2 Module Issue

#### Component

#### Ansible Version
- **Ansible Version:**
  ```
  $ ansible --version
  ansible 2.1.0.0

  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
  ```

#### Operating System and Environment

#### Summary

2. Add an additional `group_id` to the playbook.
3. Re-run the playbook.

#### Expected Results
