User: I would like to call python script files from my c++ program. 
I am not sure that the people I will distribute to will have python installed.
Basically I'm looking for a .lib file that I can use that has an Apache like distribution license.
Assistant: Using Inter Process Communication (IPC) over socket can be a possible solution. Use a local network socket to listen/trasfer commands between both.
