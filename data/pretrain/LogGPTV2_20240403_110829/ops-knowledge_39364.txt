User: I bought a low-end MacBook about a month ago and am finally getting around to configuring it for Python. I've done most of my Python work in Windows up until now, and am finding the choices for OS X a little daunting. It looks like there are at least five options to use for Python development:

"Stock" Apple Python
MacPython
Fink
MacPorts
roll-your-own-from-source

I'm still primarily developing for 2.5, so the stock Python is fine from a functionality standpoint. What I want to know is: why should I choose one over the other?
Update:
To clarify, I am looking for a discussion of the various options, not links to the documentation. I've marked this as a Community Wiki question, as I don't feel there is a "correct" answer. Thanks to everyone who has already commented for their insight.
Assistant: How about EPD from Enthought?  Yes, it's large but it is a framework build and includes things like wxPython, vtk, numpy, scipy, and ipython built-in.
