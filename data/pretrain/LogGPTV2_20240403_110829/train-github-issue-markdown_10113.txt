## Bug Report
**Current Behavior**  
When the value of an enum case references a string case on another enum an
unexpected extra key is added to the compiled javascript object. This is
especially apparent when the case names do not match.
**Input Code**  
https://bit.ly/2nRTcds
    enum Foo {
      foo = "foo"
    }
    enum Baz {
      baz = Foo.foo
    }
**Expected behavior/code**  
With the code above, I would expect a javascript object that contained one
key, "baz", with the value "foo". Instead, "Baz" has two keys, "baz", "foo",
with the values, "foo" and "baz" respectively. This does not match what the
Typescript compiler produces: https://bit.ly/2nbliQX
