### `cacls` Command

**Important:**
This command has been deprecated. Please use `icacls` instead.

**Description:**
The `cacls` command is used to display or modify discretionary access control lists (DACLs) on specified files.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
cacls  [/t] [/m] [/l] [/s[:sddl]] [/e] [/c] [/g user:permission] [/r user [...]] [/p user:permission [...]] [/d user [...]]
```

**Parameters:**

- **Required:** Displays ACLs of specified files.
- **/t**: Changes ACLs of specified files in the current directory and all subdirectories.
- **/m**: Changes ACLs of volumes mounted to a directory.
- **/l**: Works on the symbolic link itself instead of the target.
- **/s:sddl**: Replaces the ACLs with those specified in the SDDL string. This parameter is not valid for use with the `/e`, `/g`, `/r`, `/p`, or `/d` parameters.
- **/e**: Edits an ACL instead of replacing it.
- **/c**: Continues after access denied errors.
- **/g user:permission**: Grants the specified user access rights. Valid permission values include:
  - `n`: None
  - `r`: Read
  - `w`: Write
  - `c`: Change (write)
  - `f`: Full control
- **/r user [...]**: Revokes the specified user's access rights. Only valid when used with the `/e` parameter.
- **/p user:permission [...]**: Replaces the specified user's access rights. Valid permission values are the same as for `/g`.
- **/d user [...]**: Denies the specified user access.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Sample Output:**

- **Access control entry (ACE) applies to:**
  - **OI**: Object inherit. This folder and files.
  - **CI**: Container inherit. This folder and subfolders.
  - **IO**: Inherit only. The ACE does not apply to the current file/directory.
  - **No output message**: This folder only.
  - **(OI)(CI)**: This folder, subfolders, and files.
  - **(OI)(CI)(IO)**: Subfolders and files only.
  - **(CI)(IO)**: Subfolders only.
  - **(OI)(IO)**: Files only.

**Remarks:**
- You can use wildcards (`?` and `*`) to specify multiple files.
- You can specify more than one user.

By using the `icacls` command, you can achieve the same functionality with enhanced features and better support.
