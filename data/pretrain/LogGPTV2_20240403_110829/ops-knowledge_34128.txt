User: Please improve system security and prevent attacks according to the following Linux system security indicators and corresponding configuration measures. 1. Disable root user remote login\n2. Enable SSH service and authenticate through public key authentication\n3. Regularly update system patches\n4. Forbid non-essential services to run\n5. Enable firewall and configure rules to restrict network access\n n6. Configure access control to limit user access rights
Assistant: 1. Disable root user remote login - Edit the SSH configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config - Change "PermitRootLogin yes" to "PermitRootLogin no" - Restart the SSH service to make the configuration take effect 2. Enable the SSH service and perform public key authentication Authentication - Install or start the SSH service, and open port 22 - Use SSH-keygen to generate public and private keys - Put the public key in the authorized_keys file in the SSH directory of the server - Use the private key on the client for connection verification 3 .Regularly update system patches - Install update tools, such as yum or apt-get - Execute update commands, such as yum update or apt-get upgrade - Execute update commands regularly, such as once a week or once a month 4. Prohibit unnecessary services Running - View running services, such as systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled - Disable unnecessary services, such as systemctl disable <service-name> - Periodically check to avoid malware or cron tasks Re-enable disabled services 5. Enable Firewall and configure rules to restrict network access - Install firewall tools, such as iptables or firewalld - Set default rules, such as disallowing all inbound and outbound connections - Configure allowed rules, such as only allowing specific IPs to access a certain port of the server - Continuous monitoring Firewall logs to see if there is an attack or abnormal connection 6. Configure access control to limit user access rights - create different user groups, such as administrators and ordinary users - limit the rights of ordinary users, such as prohibiting modification of system configuration or execution of certain commands - Configure sudo permissions to allow administrators to use sudo commands to obtain superuser permissions - Regularly audit access control to check for unauthorized access or operations
