### Title: Black Hat US 2021: Qualcomm WiFi: Infinity War

Qualcomm is the leading chip manufacturer in the smartphone industry, with hundreds of millions of devices using its WiFi chips. Any security vulnerability in these chips can have a significant impact on users. Among the various attack surfaces, zero-click remote and adjacent attacks are particularly concerning to security researchers because they require no user interaction, making them highly stealthy. Additionally, as one of the most critical short-range communication protocols, WiFi is a prime target for attackers.

In this presentation, we will explore the security risks associated with Qualcomm WiFi chips and discuss mitigation strategies. We will illustrate these points by examining eight recently discovered zero-click remote vulnerabilities. Despite the numerous security enhancements introduced in Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 865 in 2020, our in-depth security research has uncovered additional vulnerabilities in its WiFi module. This talk will also cover our methodology for reverse engineering and exploiting WiFi vulnerabilities in the Snapdragon 865.
