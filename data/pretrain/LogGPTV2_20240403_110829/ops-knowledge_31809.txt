I understand you are attempting to deploy a PyObjC (or Cocoa-Python) application, developed in Xcode 3.2.x on Snow Leopard (10.6), onto a Mac OS X 10.5 system. While the application runs smoothly on 10.6, it fails to launch on 10.5 and crashes with the following error message:

**Dyld Error Message:**
- **Library not loaded:** /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Python
- **Referenced from:** /Users/myuser/Documents/myApp.app/Contents/MacOS/myApp
- **Reason:** image not found

This issue appears to be due to Xcode hardcoding the path to Python 2.6, which is not available on Mac OS X 10.5. The solution involves setting the Python framework path to a version that is compatible with 10.5, such as Python 2.5.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Select the Correct SDK:**
   - Xcode includes Software Development Kits (SDKs) that allow you to target earlier versions of macOS.
   - Navigate to `/Developer/SDKs` to see the currently installed SDKs. If the required SDK is not present, you can install it from an Xcode DVD or download it from Apple's developer website.
   - In your Xcode project, select the target for which you want to change the SDK. Right-click on the target and select "Get Info" (or go to the "Build Settings" tab).
   - In the "Architectures" section, find the "Base SDK" setting and select the appropriate SDK, such as "Mac OS X 10.5".

2. **Modify the Python Framework Path:**
   - To ensure the application uses the correct Python version, you need to modify the Python framework path in your project.
   - Open your project in Xcode and go to the "Build Phases" tab.
   - Look for the "Link Binary With Libraries" section and ensure that the Python framework is linked correctly. You may need to remove the existing Python 2.6 framework and add the Python 2.5 framework.
   - Alternatively, you can set the `PYTHON_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` environment variable to `2.5` in your build settings. This can be done by adding a new user-defined setting in the "Build Settings" tab.

3. **Rebuild the Application:**
   - After making these changes, clean and rebuild your application.
   - Test the application on a Mac OS X 10.5 system to ensure it launches and runs correctly.

### Example Configuration

- **Base SDK:** Mac OS X 10.5
- **Python Framework Version:** 2.5
- **Environment Variable:** `PYTHON_FRAMEWORK_VERSION = 2.5`

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully deploy your application on Mac OS X 10.5.
