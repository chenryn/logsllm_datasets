User: I'm trying to deploy on 10.5 a PyObjC (or Cocoa-Python) application developed on Xcode 3.2.X (Snow Leopard) which runs perfectly fine on 10.6 systems. 
The application doesn't launch on 10.5;it crashes at launch giving this error message (found on Crash Report):

Dyld Error Message:
    Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Python
    Referenced from: /Users/myuser/Documents/myApp.app/Contents/MacOS/myApp
    Reason: image not found

Seems that somewhere Xcode hardcodes the Versions/2.6 python framework path (instead of setting it as Versions/Current, for example).
However, I was not able to find where this link path could be modified to be set to Current (or to 2.5, maybe conditionally)...
Assistant: XCode has so called SDKs which can be used to target earlier Max OS X versions from a recent one.
Currently installed SDKs can be found in /Developer/SDKs. Additional SDKs may be installed from an XCode DVD.
In a project created with XCode, SDK can be selected the following way. Open Get info of a target, find Base SDK setting inside the Architectures section. Select SDK you need and rebuild.
For example, Mac OS X 10.5 SDK contains Python versions 2.5 and 2.3 and the Current version points to 2.5.
