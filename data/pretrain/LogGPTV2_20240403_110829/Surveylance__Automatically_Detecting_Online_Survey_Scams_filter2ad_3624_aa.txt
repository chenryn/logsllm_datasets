Abstract—Online surveys are a popular mechanism for per-
forming market research in exchange for monetary compensation.
Unfortunately, fraudulent survey websites are similarly rising in
popularity among cyber-criminals as a means for executing social
engineering attacks. In addition to the sizable population of users
that participate in online surveys as a secondary revenue stream,
unsuspecting users who search the web for free content or access
codes to commercial software can also be exposed to survey scams.
This occurs through redirection to websites that ask the user to
complete a survey in order to receive the promised content or a
reward.
In this paper, we present SURVEYLANCE, the ﬁrst system
that automatically identiﬁes survey scams using machine learning
techniques. Our evaluation demonstrates that SURVEYLANCE
works well
in practice by identifying 8,623 unique websites
involved in online survey attacks. We show that SURVEYLANCE is
suitable for assisting human analysts in survey scam detection at
scale. Our work also provides the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the
survey scam ecosystem by investigating the capabilities of these
services, mapping all the parties involved in the ecosystem, and
quantifying the consequences to users that are exposed to these
services. Our analysis reveals that a large number of survey scams
are easily reachable through the Alexa top 30K websites, and
expose users to a wide range of security issues including identity
fraud, deceptive advertisements, potentially unwanted programs
(PUPs), malicious extensions, and malware.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The growth and popularity of the Internet has brought
enormous beneﬁts to the marketing research industry. Targeted
marketing surveys bring in more than $21 billion in annual
revenue [13] by providing insights into what customers are
thinking in a speciﬁc business sector. To reach potential
customers, marketing research companies strive to directly
communicate with end-users by conducting online surveys.
Such surveys establish a reliable communication channel with
consumers and allow companies to analyze the value of a
product, perform pricing research, predict demand, or develop
effective marketing strategies. In fact, most Internet users will
have received a survey request via email at one time or another.
To encourage users to take the time and ﬁll out a survey, a
common technique is to promise rewards in the form of gift
cards, free access to popular online services, or free electronic
gadgets such as an iPad.
While such online surveys are very useful for marketing
research companies, unfortunately, attackers have also discov-
ered online surveys as a proﬁtable attack vector against users.
In fact, there have been reports of online survey scams that
aim to recruit unsuspecting users and trick them into releasing
sensitive information [14], [29]. In particular, a technically-
unsophisticated user who searches online for free content such
as video streaming channels, access codes to popular software
programs, or free gift cards may end up on these pages, and
may be tricked into willingly providing sensitive information
to attackers with the hope of acquiring interesting content. In
addition, the attackers may also engage in illegal activities such
as infecting the victims with malware.
It is known that online survey scams are actively being
used by attackers. However, the details of the attacks that
are launched, the modus operandi of the attackers, and the
reports on the different social engineering tricks the attackers
are deploying are mostly anecdotal. While there do exist some
reports about such scams by security companies [35], [26],
[41], [42], these reports have only looked at a handful of online
survey scams, have only provided a manual analysis, and have
not followed any systematic or scientiﬁc processes.
Understanding how online survey scams work in the real-
world is important, and a careful, systematic analysis is ben-
eﬁcial for a number of reasons. First, we can understand how
these websites are operated and shed light on the malicious
practices used by attackers to monetize these scams. Second,
based on the understanding we have gained, we can develop
better techniques for detecting survey scams automatically, and
prevent users from falling victim to such attacks.
In this paper, we conduct several empirical studies to
identify the main participants in the survey scam ecosystem
as well as the common malicious practices used by scammers
to launch successful attacks. We leverage this knowledge in
the development of a new system, called SURVEYLANCE,
that is able to identify survey scams using machine learning
techniques. The scalable, distributed infrastructure we have
built allowed us to perform a long-term experiment by running
SURVEYLANCE for several months to collect data on online
survey scams.
During this period, SURVEYLANCE identiﬁed 8,623 web-
sites, called survey gateways, that directed victims to 318,219
online survey scam pages. The experiments show that SUR-
VEYLANCE works well in practice by achieving a true positive
[TP] of 94.8% with 1.2% false positives [FPs]. We used the
output of SURVEYLANCE and performed more than 380,000
visits to the detected survey gateways using a number of
browser proﬁles to investigate the security implications of
online survey scams on typical users.
The analysis of the extracted dataset reveals several con-
cerning facts about survey scams on the Web. For example, our
empirical analysis shows that more than 40% of the survey

scams are reachable from the Alexa top 30K websites. Our
ﬁndings illustrate that survey gateways actively ﬁngerprint
victims before redirecting them to survey scam websites –
called survey publishers. These websites attempt to identify
users, prompt customized messages, dynamically select offers
based on user location, and store speciﬁc data about the user
for future visits.
Our large-scale experiment also shows that survey scams
expose users to a wide range of security issues including
identity fraud, deceptive advertisements, potentially unwanted
programs (PUPs), scareware, and malware. The families with
the most signiﬁcant distribution campaigns include PUPs like
Somoto, Amonetize, InstallCore, or malware that deceived
users to install adware or pay a subscription fee for resolving
a critical security issue on their machines. Our investigations
reveal that survey scammers host their infrastructures primarily
in Brazil, Eastern Europe, and Russia.
To our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst comprehensive
study of the online survey scam ecosystem. The most important
ﬁnding in this paper is the empirical evidence that shows that
survey scams are a serious and under-explored security threat.
These attacks are designed to speciﬁcally target end-users
rather than vulnerable systems. Therefore, developing security
tools that can decrease the users’ exposure to these attacks is
vital. We show that scammers monetize their operations mainly
by distributing PUPs and deceptive advertisements. In this
ecosystem, ad networks receive legitimate trafﬁc and everyone,
including the scammers, advertisers, and ad networks proﬁt.
Unfortunately, the victims instead suffer a virulent impact on
their security and privacy.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• We develop SURVEYLANCE, a tool that detects websites
involved in survey scam services. While this class of
attacks introduces similar threats to more traditional web-
based attacks such as phishing or malware websites,
it is less well-studied, and few or no details exist on
how to detect these attacks. Our large-scale evaluation
demonstrates that our technique works well in practice,
and achieves promising results (a true positive [TP] rate
of 94.8% with 1.2% false positives [FPs]).
• We identify multiple entities involved in the survey scam
ecosystem by incorporating SURVEYLANCE to passively
crawl websites, collect network traces, and perform clas-
siﬁcation. We envision multiple deployment models for
SURVEYLANCE to disrupt the operation of survey scams.
The output of SURVEYLANCE can be used to augment
blacklists or anti-malware mechanisms (e.g, Google Safe
Browsing) in major browsers to reduce the exposure of
users to these websites. Furthermore, the trained model
can be incorporated as a browser extension that monitors
the content of the visited websites, and notiﬁes the user
whether the website presents a threat.
• We used the output of SURVEYLANCE, and performed a
long-term study on the malicious practices used in online
survey scams. We show that end-users are exposed to
a wide range of threats such as identity fraud, PUPs,
malware, and scareware. We also show that these enti-
ties use several techniques to monetize their businesses
(e.g. injecting overlay ads, pop-ups). The results of our

empirical study also shows that a signiﬁcant number of
these websites are easily reachable. For example, more
than 40% of the survey gateways which redirect users to
survey scam pages are reachable through the Alexa top
30K websites.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Sec-
tion II, we provide background information on the survey scam
ecosystem. In Section III, we set the design goal, discuss
the feature set we used in SURVEYLANCE as well as the
implementation details. Section IV describes our data collec-
tion methodology. In Section V, we evaluate the detection
capabilities of our approach. An analysis of our measurements
is presented in Section VI. We discuss the limitations of
our approach in Section VII, and present related work in
Section VIII. Finally, Section IX concludes the paper.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we set the stage for our work by providing
background on survey scam services as well as deﬁning the
key terminology.
A. Online Surveys
Today, it is not uncommon to receive requests to complete a
survey from legitimate, well-known businesses – for instance,
an airline [37], [28]. Content publishers can also insert third-
party scripts that
invite users to ﬁll out a survey. Survey
owners also employ targeted advertisement services [9] on
social media to distribute invitations to users. While it
is
common among businesses to conduct surveys to access direct
feedback from users, adversaries can also use the same concept
to direct users to domains under their control.
B. Survey Scam Services
In this paper, we focus on cases where a victim is exposed
to a survey scam by issuing speciﬁc search engine queries,

or by clicking on links designed to lure them to a scam
(e.g. to watch a newly released movie, a live sports event,
or to download free content). After ﬁlling out the survey, the
user does not receive the promised content, but is instead
exposed to one or more malicious activities. This can include
leakage of sensitive personal information, redirection to other
malicious pages, downloading potentially unwanted programs
(PUPs), or being exposed to malware. Figure 1 shows an
overview of the survey scam ecosystem which consists of
three main participants: survey gateways, survey publishers,
and advertisers. We arrived at this model through a manual
analysis of several survey scams. We describe the role and
monetization model for each party below.
Survey gateways are primarily designed to convert a vis-
iting user to a potential victim by encouraging him to accept
a survey request. Furthermore, a survey gateway serves as a
scheduler which assigns a survey to the visiting user, similar
to a typical ad network that matches ads to users. Our inves-
tigation conﬁrms that these websites attempt to identify users,
customize the messages shown to users, and store speciﬁc
data for future visits using the browser LocalStorage APIs
(see Section B). An unsuspecting user may proceed to ﬁll out
a survey for several reasons. She may complete a survey to
receive the free version of the content she was looking for
in the ﬁrst place, or to receive rewards after accepting an
appealing invitation during her browsing session.
Survey publishers supply tailored surveys to survey gate-
ways. Once the user agrees to participate in the survey,
the gateway redirects the user to a page that publishes the
survey and asks the user to proceed. In addition to collecting
sensitive user information (e.g. home address, phone number)
which can be exploited in other adversarial activities, survey
publishers earn money by driving users to ad-tracking sites or
afﬁliate programs [29] before actually proceeding to the survey.
However, unlike traditional publishers that have to generate
content to attract users, survey scam services attract users with
enticing but fake rewards; extract sensitive information; and
expose users to malicious binaries and rogue advertisements
which defraud users and monetize adversaries’ businesses at
the expense of users’ security.
C. A Motivating Example
When the user visits a survey gateway, she is requested
to provide some information such as age, gender, or email
address. The survey gateway then directs the user to a survey
publisher. In Section B, we show that this operation relies
on identifying users and generating new IDs to prompt cus-
tomized messages or dynamically select enticing offers. After
completing the survey, the user is asked to claim her reward by
following a link. This link can redirect the user to an afﬁliate
program, a scam page, or a malware website. For example,
clicking the button on l0086sjt.com redirected us to another
website that delivered a sample of PUP.Optional.LoadMoney.
Note that the example we discussed here is not synthetic
and is a simpliﬁed version of this speciﬁc web-based social
engineering attack. Our experiments, discussed at length in VI,
show that these attacks occur quite frequently. In this ecosys-
tem, all the involved parties, including ad networks, scammers,
and advertisers, proﬁt. Unfortunately, the victim instead suffers

III. SURVEYLANCE
In this section, we describe the architecture of SURVEY-
LANCE by providing details on feature extraction, classiﬁca-
tion, and our prototype implementation.
A. Overview
SURVEYLANCE uses a classiﬁcation model that is specif-
ically designed to distinguish survey gateways from normal
websites including benign survey pages. We target survey
gateways as they are usually the entry point to several different
survey publishers. One of the design requirements of the
system is to avoid relying on easily-evadable features such
as IP addresses or domain names, and instead incorporating
features that directly target the conceptual operations of survey
scams (e.g., types of inputs, particular images). These features
rely on the look and feel of these sites, their source code,
HTTP requests, HTTP responses issued to and received from
these sites, as well as the redirection chains involving these
sites.
