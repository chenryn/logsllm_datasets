## Abstract
Online surveys are a popular method for conducting market research, often offering monetary compensation to participants. However, fraudulent survey websites have become increasingly prevalent as a tool for social engineering attacks. These scams not only target users seeking secondary income but also unsuspecting individuals searching for free content or access codes to commercial software. This paper introduces SURVEYLANCE, the first system that automatically identifies survey scams using machine learning techniques. Our evaluation shows that SURVEYLANCE effectively identified 8,623 unique websites involved in online survey attacks. The system is suitable for large-scale detection and provides a systematic analysis of the survey scam ecosystem, including the capabilities of these services, the parties involved, and the security risks to users. Our findings reveal that a significant number of survey scams are easily reachable through the Alexa top 30K websites, exposing users to various security issues such as identity fraud, deceptive advertisements, potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), malicious extensions, and malware.

## I. Introduction
The growth and popularity of the Internet have greatly benefited the marketing research industry. Targeted marketing surveys generate over $21 billion in annual revenue by providing valuable insights into customer behavior. To reach potential customers, companies conduct online surveys, which establish a reliable communication channel with consumers. These surveys help companies analyze product value, perform pricing research, predict demand, and develop effective marketing strategies. Commonly, users are incentivized to complete surveys with rewards like gift cards, free access to popular online services, or free electronic gadgets.

However, attackers have also recognized online surveys as a profitable attack vector. Reports indicate that online survey scams aim to trick unsuspecting users into releasing sensitive information. Technically unsophisticated users searching for free content, such as video streaming channels, access codes to popular software, or free gift cards, may end up on these scam pages and be deceived into providing personal information. Attackers may also engage in illegal activities, such as infecting victims with malware.

While it is known that online survey scams are actively used by attackers, detailed reports on the modus operandi and social engineering tricks employed are largely anecdotal. Some security companies have provided manual analyses, but these lack systematic and scientific rigor.

Understanding how online survey scams operate in the real world is crucial for developing better detection techniques and protecting users. In this paper, we conduct several empirical studies to identify the main participants in the survey scam ecosystem and the common malicious practices used by scammers. We leverage this knowledge to develop SURVEYLANCE, a new system that uses machine learning to detect survey scams. Our scalable, distributed infrastructure allowed us to run SURVEYLANCE for several months, identifying 8,623 survey gateways that directed victims to 318,219 online survey scam pages. The experiments show that SURVEYLANCE achieves a true positive rate of 94.8% with 1.2% false positives.

Our analysis reveals that more than 40% of survey scams are reachable from the Alexa top 30K websites. Survey gateways actively fingerprint victims before redirecting them to survey publishers, which attempt to identify users, prompt customized messages, dynamically select offers based on user location, and store specific data for future visits. Users are exposed to a wide range of security issues, including identity fraud, deceptive advertisements, PUPs, scareware, and malware. The most significant distribution campaigns include PUPs like Somoto, Amonetize, and InstallCore, and malware that deceives users into installing adware or paying subscription fees for resolving critical security issues.

This work is the first comprehensive study of the online survey scam ecosystem. Our key finding is the empirical evidence that survey scams are a serious and under-explored security threat. Developing tools to reduce users' exposure to these attacks is vital. Scammers monetize their operations primarily by distributing PUPs and deceptive advertisements, with ad networks, scammers, and advertisers all profiting at the expense of victims' security and privacy.

## II. Background
### A. Online Surveys
It is common for legitimate businesses to request users to complete surveys, often offering incentives. Content publishers and survey owners use targeted advertisement services on social media to distribute survey invitations. While businesses use surveys to gather direct feedback, adversaries can exploit the same concept to direct users to malicious domains.

### B. Survey Scam Services
Survey scams occur when victims are lured by specific search engine queries or links designed to deceive them. After completing the survey, users do not receive the promised content but are instead exposed to malicious activities, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information, redirection to other malicious pages, or exposure to PUPs and malware. The survey scam ecosystem consists of three main participants: survey gateways, survey publishers, and advertisers.

- **Survey Gateways**: These sites convert visiting users into potential victims by encouraging them to accept a survey request. They serve as schedulers, assigning surveys to users. Our investigation confirms that these websites identify users, customize messages, and store specific data for future visits using browser LocalStorage APIs.
- **Survey Publishers**: These entities supply tailored surveys to survey gateways. Once a user agrees to participate, they are redirected to a page that publishes the survey. Survey publishers collect sensitive user information and earn money by driving users to ad-tracking sites or affiliate programs.
- **Advertisers**: These parties profit from the traffic generated by survey scams, often at the expense of users' security and privacy.

### C. A Motivating Example
When a user visits a survey gateway, they are asked to provide personal information such as age, gender, or email address. The gateway then redirects the user to a survey publisher. After completing the survey, the user is asked to claim a reward, which may lead to an affiliate program, a scam page, or a malware website. For example, clicking a button on l0086sjt.com redirected us to a site delivering a sample of PUP.Optional.LoadMoney. This example is not synthetic and is a simplified version of a web-based social engineering attack. Our experiments show that these attacks occur frequently, and all involved parties, including ad networks, scammers, and advertisers, profit, while the victim suffers a negative impact on their security and privacy.

## III. Surveylance
### A. Overview
SURVEYLANCE uses a classification model specifically designed to distinguish survey gateways from normal websites, including benign survey pages. We target survey gateways as they are typically the entry point to multiple survey publishers. The system avoids relying on easily evadable features like IP addresses or domain names, instead incorporating features that target the conceptual operations of survey scams, such as types of inputs, particular images, and redirection chains.
