Question: A company's file server is using user claims to control access to files, and the server needs to support client principals whose accounts might be in a domain running a version of Windows before Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012. Given this scenario, how should the 'Microsoft network server: Attempt S4U2Self to obtain claim information' security policy setting be configured to best support this environment?
"A": "The setting should be set to 'Not defined' to allow the file server to automatically evaluate whether claims are needed for the user.",
"B": "The setting should be set to 'Default', which is the same as 'Enabled', to ensure the server can obtain a claims-enabled access token if needed.",
"C": "The setting should be set to 'Disabled' to prevent the server from using Kerberos S4U2Self to obtain claim information unnecessarily.",
"D": "The setting should be explicitly configured to 'Enabled' in this scenario to ensure the file server will obtain a claims-enabled access token if the client principals' claims are not present."
Answer: D
