Information, and Administrator, NTIA, in carrying out its spectrum management
activities.  The IRAC comprises a main committee, four subcommittees, and an
international group. [11]

The production, in a nonlinear element of a system, of frequencies corresponding
to the sum and difference frequencies of the fundamentals and harmonics thereof
that are transmitted through the element. [7]
interoperability
1. The ability of systems, units, or forces to provide services to and accept services
from other systems, units, or forces and to use the services so exchanged to enable
them to operate effectively together.  2. The condition achieved among
communications-electronics systems or items of communications-electronics
equipment when information or services can be exchanged directly and
satisfactorily between them and/or their users.  The degree of interoperability

between changes of state, i.e., between individual signal elements.  Note 1: At a
certain threshold, intersymbol interference will compromise the integrity of the
received data.  Note 2: Intersymbol interference attributable to the statistical nature
of quantum mechanisms sets the fundamental limit to receiver sensitivity. [7]

antenna by two or more paths.  Note 1: Causes of multipath include atmospheric
ducting, ionospheric reflection and refraction, and reflection from terrestrial
objects, such as mountains and buildings.  Note 2: The effects of multipath include
constructive and destructive interference, and phase shifting of the signal.  Note 3:
In facsimile and television transmission, multipath causes jitter and ghosting. [7]

operation
In telephone or two-way radio systems, that method of communication over a
speech circuit in which the talker is required to keep a switch operated while
talking.  Note: In two-way radio, push-to-talk operation must be used when the
same frequency is employed by both transmitters.  For use in noisy environments,
or for privacy, some telephone handsets have push-to-talk switches that allow the
speaker to be heard only when the switch is activated.  Synonym press-to-talk

Q
quantization
A process in which the continuous range of values of an analog signal is sampled
and divided into non-overlapping (but not necessarily equal) subranges, and a
discrete, unique value is assigned to each subrange.  Note: An application of
quantization is its use in pulse-code modulation.  If the sampled signal value falls
within a given subrange, the sample is assigned the corresponding discrete value
for purposes of modulation and transmission. [7]
quantization noise
Noise caused by the error of approximation in quantization.  Note: Quantization
noise is dependent on the particular quantization process used and the statistical
characteristics of the quantized signal.  Synonym quantizing noise. [7]

the call originator and the arrival of a permission to transmit to the call originator.
R

Frequency hopping, direct sequence spreading, time scrambling, and combinations
of these techniques are forms of spread spectrum.  2. A signal structuring
technique that employs direct sequence, frequency hopping or a hybrid of these,
which can be used for multiple access and/or multiple functions.  This technique
decreases the potential interference to other receivers while achieving privacy and
increasing the immunity of spread spectrum receivers to noise and interference.
Spread spectrum generally makes use of a sequential noise-like signal structure to
spread the normally narrowband information signal over a relatively wide band of
frequencies.  The receiver correlates the signals to retrieve the original information
signal. [7]

time division multiple access
(TDMA)
1. A communications technique that uses a common channel (multipoint or

slots to different users.  Note: TDMA is used extensively in satellite systems, local
area networks, physical security systems, and combat-net radio systems. [7]  2. A
channel access method in which different conversations are separated into
different time slots. [10]
transceiver

communication channel. [8]
transponder
An automatic device that receives, amplifies, and retransmits a signal on a
different frequency. [7]  Synonym RF repeater.
trunk
A single transmission channel between two points that are switching centers or
nodes, or both. [8]
trunked (system)
Systems with full feature sets in which all aspects of radio operation, including RF
channel selection and access, are centrally managed. [8]
trunking
An infrastructure dependent technique where communications resources,
comprised of more than one logical channel (trunk) are shared amongst system
users by means of an automatic resource allocation management technique based
upon statistical queueing theory and resident in the system’s fixed infrastructure.
Typically usage requests follow a Poisson arrival process and the resource
allocator assigns communications resources in response to requests form system
users.  As demand for service exceeds system capability at that time, service must
be increasingly denied immediate access.  This action is termed "blocking," with
the blocked service request being queued for a later service response.  The offered
grade of service of the system is inversely proportional to the probability of
blocking (e.g. lower probability of blocking offers a higher grade of service
potential).  The dynamic resource allocation methodology of trunking results in the
establishment of functional channels defining resource availability by means of
dynamically allocating logical channels both to particular subscribers and for
specific functions.  These functional channels can be used for the conveyance of
payload information, system control or a combination thereof. [8]
trunked radio system
A system that integrates multiple channel pairs into a single system.  When a user
wants to transmit a message, the trunked system automatically selects a currently
unused channel pair and assigns it to the user, decreasing the probability of having
to wait for a free channel for a given channel loading. [10]
type 1 product

users, their contractors, and federally sponsored non-U.S. Government activities
subject to export restrictions in accordance with International Traffic in Arms
Regulation. [7]
type 2 product

National Security Agency, for use in telecommunications and automated
information systems for the protection of national security information.  Note: The
term refers only to products, and no to information, key, services, or controls.
Type 2 products may not be used for classified information, but contain classified
National Security Agency algorithms that distinguish them from products
containing the unclassified data algorithm.  Type 2 products are subject to export
restrictions in accordance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation. [7]
