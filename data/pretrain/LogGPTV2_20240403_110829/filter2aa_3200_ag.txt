Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
In 1994, Michigan began the construction of an all-weather digital statewide 
interoperable 2-way mobile radio communication system for use by Michigan's 
public safety community.  Known as the Michigan Public Safety 
Communication System (MPSCS), the system was constructed to support the 
communication needs of all public safety agencies in the state wishing to join 
MPSCS as a member.  MPSCS was designed and constructed by Motorola, one 
of the industry leaders in public safety communication. 
MPSCS operates in the 821 radio frequency band dedicated to public safety communication.  
MPSCS is supported by a microwave backbone that controls traffic on the system and also 
supports a sophisticated alarm and control system.  MPSCS present design capacity will support 
64,000 radio ID's and 16,000 talkgroups.  MPSCS has the ability to integrate with other 800 
MHZ Motorola systems (thereby expanding its capacity within the State) and to support data 
sharing.  For example, MPSCS is integrated with 3 sites in Livingston, Mason, Oceana, and 
Kalamazoo  Counties, and 
systems in Monroe and Genesee 
Counties, and the City of Detroit. 
Additional integration projects 
are underway in Berrien, 
Calhoun, Ionia, St. Clair, and 
Washtenaw Counties.  Today 
over 33,000 radios representing 
800 agencies utilize MPSCS.

Communications Division, operates MPSCS.  An appointed advisory board comprised of 
Members and representatives of public safety advises the Governor and the Director of the 
Department of Information Technology on public safety communication issues and utilization of 
the MPSCS to advance interoperable communications.   
Besides MPSCS, other Michigan communities are pursuing other public safety communication 
options.  For example, Oakland County is in the process of building a M/A-COM designed 
communication system.  Oakland's communication system is intended to provide interoperable 
public safety communications for all public safety agencies in the County. 
Utilizing the M/A-COM Opensky technology (end-to end Internet Protocol (IP) and time-
division multiple access (TDMA) airlink) Oakland's system will have following features: 
• Digital and analog radio interoperability with systems of any type  
• Enhanced data capability for quick download of data and graphic files  
• Efficient use of radio frequencies  
• GPS tracking  
• Remote software reconfiguration and easy upgrades  
Additionally, Oakland County and MPSCS are participating in a pilot interoperability solution 
utilizing M/A-COM's Network First solution. This pilot project is ongoing. 
Along with sustaining and enhancing the Michigan Public Safety Communications System, 
patches and links will be identified and developed for those organizations and jurisdictions 
operating on a separate system.  The state is also working to analyze the capabilities of 
complimentary communication and information sharing systems. 
Michigan has invested $221,000,000 in the construction of the statewide public safety 
communications system and is currently investing another $19,000,000 to upgrade the system to 
provide data capability statewide. 
The State of Michigan has been recognized by the Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) and 
other knowledgeable industry and user groups as visionary in its 25 plus year approach to 
interoperability.  No other state in the country boasts such a system.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
 Minnesota has implemented the Allied Radio Matrix for Emergency Response 
(ARMER).  Aging communication infrastructure, the lack of frequencies, 
interoperability across bands and interoperability across systems, add up to a critical 
need to improve Minnesota's public safety communication infrastructure.  The “800 
MHz Executive Team Report” to the 2001 Minnesota Legislature 
(www.dot.state.mn.us/oec/ statewide/statewideinfo.html) requires a coordinated 
response through the development of the Statewide Public Safety Radio 
Communication Plan.  This communication priority is also reflected in Minnesota's 
2004 Homeland Security Strategy and Assessment, Goal 7: "Implement a statewide system of 
Interoperable communication for local and state resources to be more effective and efficient in ensuring 
the safety of the citizens and emergency responders in Minnesota." 
Statewide Public Safety Radio Communication Plan 
The objective of this goal is to provide for the planning and development of a statewide interoperable 
trunked radio system to replace the existing diverse and antiquated analog communication systems. This 
plan provides for a phased statewide development of the radio system infrastructure. The plan calls for six 
phases, with Phase 1 covering the 
initial backbone construction in the 
seven county metropolitan area plus 
Chisago and Isanti counties. Phase 2 
included local enhancements to the 
initial backbone in the seven county 
metropolitan area. 
Phases of Development 
Phase 1 – Basic communication 
backbone and interoperability 
infrastructure completed December 
2002, which included local 
enhancements to Carver County,

ARMER Governance Structure 
• 
With the completion of the Phase 1 backbone in the metropolitan area, there was a need to shift 
from a regional to a statewide emphasis. The 2004 Minnesota Legislature created the Statewide 
Radio Board (SRB) out of the Statewide Public Safety Radio and Communication Planning 
Committee. The SRB is composed of twenty-one members, including the following: 
• 
Commissioner of Public Safety – Chair 
• 
Commissioner of Transportation 
• 
Commissioner of Natural Resources 
• 
Commissioner of Administration 
• 
Commissioner of Health 
• 
Commissioner of Finance 
• 
Chief of the Minnesota State Patrol 
• 
Chair of the Metropolitan Emergency Services Board 
• 
A regional radio board representative 
• 
Local officials as follows (one from metro and one from greater Minnesota): 
• 
Two elected city officials 
• 
Two elected county officials 
• 
Two sheriffs 
• 
Two chiefs of police 
• 
Two fire chiefs 
• 
Two emergency medical service providers 
Currently, approximately 87 percent of public safety officials (based upon population covered) in the 
metropolitan area are operating on the regional interoperable radio system.  The transition of Dakota and 
Ramsey counties to the regional system will bring the local commitment for infrastructure to $59.2 
million. The percentage of public safety officials operating on the system will increase with the addition 
of Dakota County in 2006.  With the allocation of $45 million to the continued expansion of a statewide 
interoperable communication system, the Statewide Radio Board, the Department of Public Safety and 
the Department of Transportation are formulating their construction plans.
