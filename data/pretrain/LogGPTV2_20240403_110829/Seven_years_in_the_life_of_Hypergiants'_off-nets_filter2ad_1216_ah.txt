manually filter. We treat ASes that do not belong to the HG organi-
zation but host IP addresses that serve its associated certificates as
hosts of its off-net footprint (§4).
A.3 Characteristics of HG Certificates
We present indicative interesting characteristics of HG-served cer-
tificates.
Certificate Numbers and IP Groups. The total number of cer-
tificates differs among HGs, from a few 100s (Google, 2021) to many
1000s (Facebook, 2021). The number tends to increase over time,
albeit at different rates per HG. Each certificate can be served by
multiple IP addresses. Figure 11 shows the coverage of the top ten
IP groups (each serving the same certificate) for Google and Face-
book over time. The top ten groups include over 90% of Google’s
certificate-serving IP addresses, with over 50% of them serving
the certificate that certifies *.googlevideo.com among other DNS
names for Google’s off-net services. Facebook started with heavy
530
aggregation in 2014 and ended up with a disaggregated pattern in
2021.
Expiration Times. The validity period for HG TLS certificates
vary from weeks to years, varying both across HGs and across time.
For example, Microsoft’s certificates have a median duration of 1
year (2013-2016), between 1 and 2 years (2016-2017) or 2 years (2018-
2019). Google generally uses certificates with median duration of 3
months. Netflix’s median expiry times oscillate between 8 months
and 2 years. However, median Netflix expiry times dropped within
2019, reaching 35 days, corresponding to its strategic shift towards
short-lived certificates, first announced in 2016 [84].
A.4 Survey Questions
The survey was for the analysis of data on November 30, 2020. The
questions are as follows:
1. Overall, how do you rate the estimation of the off-net footprint of
your HG?:
2. Do we overestimate or underestimate the off-net footprint of your
HG?
• Overestimate
• Underestimate
• Estimation is quite accurate
3. What is our estimation error of the off-net footprint?
• Excellent
• Very good
• Good
• Poor
• 1%
• 5%
• 10%
• 20%+
4. Do we miss any AS when we report the off-net footprint of your
HG? If yes, what type of ASes do we miss?
• Only a few ASes are missing
• Datacenter ASes
• Eyeball ASes
• Transit ASes
• free text – report the type(s) of ASes
A.5 List of Keywords and Headers
In Table 4 we present the keywords and headers we used in our
study to identify HGs and validate the installation of their servers
in off-nets (see Section 4.4). In addition to the HGs listed in Table 4,
we used the following Hypergiant keywords: Bamtech, CDN77,
Cachefly, Chinacache, Disney, Highwinds, and Yahoo. For the latter
list of HGs, we were not able to identify unique HTTP(S) headers
to extract fingerprints.
A.6 User Population Coverage based on
Customer Cone
Section 6.5 examined how much of the Internet user population
can be served from Google’s off-nets, if they serve users within
the hosting networks and their customer cones. Figure 12 plots

Serving into the customer cone (rather than just serving the host-
ing networks) noticeably expands Facebooks coverage in parts of
Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America (Figure 12a compared to
Figure 9b), expanding service from 49.9% to 63.2%, i.e, a 26.8% in-
crease of Internet users. For Netflix, serving within customer cones
slightly increases population coverage for countries in South Amer-
ica, North America, and Africa (Figure 12b compared to Figure 7b),
that increase the user population coverage from 16.3% to 26%, i.e.,

59.4% increase. The coverage for Akamai increases significantly for
countries located in Asia, Europe, and South America (Figure 12c
compared to Figure 7c), resulting in a 49.1% increase, from 51.7% to
77%. The dramatic increase in Akamai’s coverage when considering
users within the customer cones of ASes hosting Akamai off-nets
makes sense given Akamai’s observed strategy of shrinkings its
footprint within small ASes in favor of large ASes (§6.3).

period, they reach a plateau in terms of the number of ASes with
a slight decline in 14b. Last but not least, our analysis shows that
about 5% of the total number of ASes, on average, in each snapshot,
are newcomers, i.e., ASes never seen in past snapshots. Overall,
there is a clear symbiotic pattern due to the fact that along with
newcomers there are ASes which strategically decide to host more
HG servers over the years. Nevertheless, there are a few other ASes
that stop appearing as HG hosts.
A.7 Off-Net Growth per Network Type and per
Region
Combining Sections 6.3 and 6.4, in order to get insights on the
growth per network type (Stub, Small, Medium, Large) in the dif-
ferent regions, we plot in Figure 13 the number of different net-
work types that host off-net Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Akamai
servers. Our results indicate that the expansion of HG off-nets into
more stub ASes slows down in all regions and for all top-4 HGs
until early 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Af-
ter the summer of 2020, expansion picks up across all HGs and
regions, with the exception of Akamai. The fraction of stub ASes
with Akamai off-nets shrinks by around 80% in North America, but
doubles in Asia, suggesting that large CDNs can flexibly rearrange
their off-net footprint within a few years to better achieve their
objectives (potentially choosing not to replace servers as they age
out).
The aggressive growth of Google, Netflix, and Facebook is also
visible in South America, as well as in Asia by Facebook and Akamai.
Akamai’s off-net footprint decreases by more than 50% in small
ASes over the years. We observe similar growth for the top-4 HGs in
Medium ASes as we observe in Small ASes. A noticeable exception
is Akamai, which has expanded its footprint in Medium ASes in
Asia and South America. Overall, our results suggest that Akamai is
shifting its s off-net footprint away from Stub and Small networks
towards Medium and larger networks in Asia and North America.
A.8 Willingness by Networks to Host HGs
We further investigate how the symbiosis of HGs and networks
(see Section 6.6) evolves, especially for the four Hypergiants with
the largest footprints. In Figures 14a and 14b we present the total
number of ASes that host at least one top-4 HG in at least 25%
and at least 50% of the dataset snapshots respectively, and what
percentage they represent of the total ASes that host ≥1 of the top-
11 HGs in at least one data snapshot (percentages as shown at the
end of sub-bars). Both figures show that the majority of ASes chose
to host only one top-4 HG until late 2019, where we see a shift, as
more and more ASes select to host up to all the top-4 HGs. A steady
rise of the number of ASes with >2 HGs takes place again until late
2019, when we notice ASes are starting to host more and more HGs
outside of the big 4. This trend coincides with the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, as the content providers are adjusting their
deployment strategies in order to meet the suddenly increased user
traffic demand. In addition, even if the percentage of ASes (for the
same timestamp between Fig. 14a and Fig. 14b) that hosts one to
four top-4 HGs across years varies between 10% and 20%, we notice
a similar trend with respect to the symbiosis of HGs. That is, until
2016, we constantly observe that more ASes are willing to host
more HGs servers with a peak between 2017 and 2018. After that
