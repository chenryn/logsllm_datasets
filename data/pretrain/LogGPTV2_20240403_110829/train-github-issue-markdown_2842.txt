### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
Go Playground
### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?
Go Playground
### What did you do?
See https://play.golang.org/p/beWgN_LRyJ \-- it fails to compile with
`internal compiler error: large ONEW with EscNone: new()`. The code itself
doesn't make a lot of sense, building a buffer and not using it, but it should
still compile.
### What did you expect to see?
The program should run on the Go Playground.
### What did you see instead?
The program fails to compile with `internal compiler error: large ONEW with
EscNone: new()`
### Other
If I assign the buffer to a variable and invoke a method, the code compiles
and runs. See https://play.golang.org/p/tKXN_mw_Sp
