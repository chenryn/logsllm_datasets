Tzu states that to avoid a superior adversary is not cowardice, but wisdom.354 More-
over, due to the painstaking nature of objective calculations, patience is a virtue.
Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has 
been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for 
victory. AoW: IV. Tactical Dispositions
Commanding a cyber corps will require a healthy mix of these admirable qualities. 
As a battleground, cyberspace offers political and military leaders almost limitless 
possibilities for success – and failure. Behind its façade of global connectivity and 
influence, the Internet has a complicated and vulnerable architecture that is an ideal

environment in which to conduct asymmetric and often anonymous military opera-
tions. Imagination and creativity are required skill sets. Cyber warfare also involves 
an enormous amount of uncertainty; even knowing whether one is under attack can 
be an immense challenge. And the high tempo of Internet operations may lead to a 
high burn-out rate throughout the ranks.
A cyber commander must have a minimum level of subject matter expertise in IT. 
The core concepts of computing, networking, and data security should be thorough-
ly understood before employing them in support of a national security agenda. Any 
leader must be able to articulate the mission so that everyone in the organization 
understands and believes in it;355 a further challenge in cyber warfare will be com-
municating with highly technical personalities, who have vastly different personal 
needs than the soldiers of a traditional military element.
In all future wars, military leadership will have the challenge of coordinating and 
deconflicting the cyber and non-cyber elements of a battle plan. Sun Tzu gives high 
praise for a great tactician:
Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize 
the different elements thereof before pitching his camp. After that, comes tactical 
maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical 
maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain. 
AoW: VII. Maneuvering
As circumstances change throughout the course of a conflict, both tactics and strat-
egy must be reevaluated and modified to fit the new environment.356
He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in 
winning, may be called a heaven-born captain. AoW: VI. Weak Points and Strong
The dynamic nature of the Internet and the speed of computer network operations 
guarantee that traditional military challenges such as seizing the initiative and 
maintaining momentum will require faster decision cycles than a traditional chain-
of-command can manage. A cyber commander must have the ability and the trust of 
his or her superiors to act quickly, creatively, and decisively.

Sun Tzu: Can Our Best Military Doctrine Encompass Cyber War?
Art of Cyber War: Elements of a New Framework
Art of War is the most influential military treatise in human history. The book has 
survived over 2,500 years in part because its guidance is highly flexible. Strategists 
and tacticians have adapted Art of War to new circumstances across many scientific 
revolutions, and Sun Tzu’s insight has never lost much of its resonance.
This chapter argues that in the future cyber warfare practitioners should also use 
Art of War as an essential guide to military strategy. However, cyberspace possesses 
many characteristics that are unlike anything Sun Tzu could have imagined in an-
cient China. There are at least ten distinctive aspects of the cyber battlefield.
1. 
The Internet is an artificial environment that can be shaped in part according 
to national security requirements.
2. The rapid proliferation of Internet technologies, including hacker tools and 
tactics, makes it impossible for any organization to be familiar with all of 
them.
3. 
The physical proximity of adversaries loses much of its relevance as cyber 
attacks are launched without regard to terrestrial geography.
4. 
Frequent software updates and network reconfiguration change Internet ge-
ography unpredictably and without warning.
5. 
In a reversal of our historical understanding of warfare, the asymmetric na-
ture of cyber attacks strongly favors the attacker.
6. 
Cyber attacks are more flexible than any weapon the world has seen. They 
can be used for propaganda, espionage, and the destruction of critical infra-
structure.
7. 
Cyber attacks can be conducted with such a high degree of anonymity that 
defense strategies such as deterrence and retaliation are not credible.
8. 
It is possible that a lengthy and costly cyber war could take place without 
anyone but the direct participants knowing about it.357
9. 
The intangible nature of cyberspace can make the calculation of victory, de-
feat, and battle damage a highly subjective undertaking.
10. There are few moral inhibitions to cyber warfare because it relates primarily 
to the use and exploitation of information in the form of computer code and 
data packets; so far, there is little perceived human suffering.
357 Libicki, 2009.

NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
None of these characteristics of cyberspace or cyber conflict fits easily into Sun 
Tzu’s paradigm. As national security thinkers and military strategists begin to write 
concepts, strategies, and doctrine for cyber warfare with the Art of War model in 
mind, they should be aware of these differences.

Deterrence: Can We Prevent Cyber Attacks?
7. DETERRENCE: CAN WE PREVENT CYBER 
ATTACKS?
National security planners have begun to look beyond reactive, tactical cyber de-
fense to proactive, strategic cyber defense, which may include international military 
deterrence. The incredible power of nuclear weapons gave birth to deterrence, a 
military strategy in which the purpose of armies shifted from winning wars to pre-
venting them. Although cyber attacks per se do not compare to a nuclear explosion, 
they do pose a serious and increasing threat to international security. Real-world 
examples suggest that cyber warfare will play a lead role in future international con-
flicts. This chapter examines the two deterrence strategies available to nation-states 
(denial and punishment) and their three basic requirements (capability, communica-
tion, and credibility) in light of cyber warfare. It also explores whether the two most 
challenging aspects of cyber attacks – attribution and asymmetry – will make cyber 
attack deterrence an impossible task.
Cyber Attacks and Deterrence Theory
The advent of nuclear weapons disrupted the historical logic of war completely. 
Deterrence theory emerged after the United States and the Soviet Union created 
enough military firepower to destroy human civilization on our planet. From that 
point forward, according to the American military strategist Bernard Brodie,358 the 
purpose of armies shifted from winning wars to preventing them.
Nothing compares to the destructive power of a nuclear blast. But cyber attacks 
loom on the horizon as a threat that is best understood as an extraordinary means 
to a wide variety of political and military ends, many of which can have serious 
national security ramifications. For example, computer hacking can be used to steal 
offensive weapons technology (including technology for weapons of mass destruc-
tion) or to render an adversary’s defenses inoperable during a conventional military 
attack.359 In that light, attempting proactively to deter cyber attacks may become an 
essential part of national military strategies. This chapter examines whether it is 
possible to apply deterrence theory to cyber attacks.
What military officers call the “battlespace” grows more difficult to define – and to 
defend – over time. In 1965, Gordon Moore correctly predicted that the number of 
transistors on a computer chip would double every two years. There has been simi-
lar growth in almost all aspects of information technology (IT), including practical

encryption, user-friendly hacker tools, and Web-enabled open source intelligence 
(OSINT). Even the basic services of a modern society, such as water, electricity and 
telecommunications, are now computerized and often connected to the Internet.360
Advances in technology are normally evolutionary, but they can be revolutionary 
– artillery reached over the front lines of battle, and rockets and airplanes crossed 
national boundaries. Today, cyber attacks can target political leadership, military 
systems, and average citizens anywhere in the world, during peacetime or war, with 
the added benefit of attacker anonymity. Political and military strategists now use 
and abuse computers, databases, and the networks that connect them to achieve 
their objectives. In the early 1980s, this concept was already known in the Soviet 
Union as the Military Technological Revolution (MTR); after the 1991 Gulf War, the 
Pentagon’s Revolution in Military Affairs was almost a household term.361
However, the real-world impact of cyber conflict is still difficult to appreciate, in 
part because there have been no wars between modern cyber-capable militaries. 
But an examination of international affairs over the past two decades suggests that 
cyber battles of increasing consequence are easy to find. Since the earliest days of 
the World Wide Web, Chechen guerilla fighters, armed not only with rifles but with 
digital cameras and HTML, have demonstrated the power of Internet-enabled propa-
ganda.362 In 2001, tensions between the United States and China spilled over into a 
non-state, “patriotic” hacker war, with uncertain consequences for national security 
leadership.363 In 2007, Syrian air defense was reportedly disabled by a cyber attack 
moments before the Israeli air force demolished an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor.364 
In 2009, the entire nation-state of Kyrgyzstan was knocked offline during a time 
of domestic political crisis,365 and Iranian voters, in “open war” with state security 
forces, used peer-to-peer social networking websites to avoid government restric-
tions on dialogue with the outside world.366 Such a rapid development in the use of 
cyber tools and tactics suggests that they will play a lead role in future international 
conflicts.
While the Internet has on balance been hugely beneficial to society, law enforce-
ment, and counterintelligence, personnel struggle to keep pace with its security

implications. The ubiquity of the Internet makes cyber warfare a strategic weapon 
since adversaries can exchange blows at will, regardless of the physical distance be-
tween them. By contrast, cyber defense is a tedious process, and cyber attack inves-
tigations are typically inconclusive. The astonishing achievements of cyber crime 
and cyber espionage should hint at the potential damage of a true nation-state-spon-
sored cyber attack. Intelligence officials such as former CIA director James Woolsey 
fear that even terrorist groups will possess cyber weapons of strategic significance 
in the next few years.
Military leaders have begun to look beyond reactive, tactical cyber defense367 to the 
formulation of a proactive, strategic cyber defense policy, which may include inter-
national military deterrence.368 However, two challenging aspects of cyber attacks 
– attribution and asymmetry – will be difficult to overcome.
In theory, nation-states have two primary deterrence strategies – denial and punish-
ment. Both strategies have three basic requirements – capability, communication, 
and credibility.369
This chapter will examine each concept in turn and explore whether it is possible to 
deter cyber attacks at the nation-state level.
Cyber Attack Deterrence by Denial
Deterrence by denial is a strategy in which an adversary is physically prevented 
from acquiring a threatening technology. This is the preferred option in the nuclear 
sphere because there is no practical defense against a nuclear explosion.  Its heat 
alone is comparable to the interior of the sun, and its blast can demolish reinforced 
concrete buildings three kilometers away.370 The abhorrent nature of nuclear war-
fare makes even a theoretical victory difficult to imagine. Deterrence by denial is a 
philosophy embodied in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and one reason behind 
current international tension with North Korea and Iran.371
367 E.g., how to configure a network or an intrusion detection system.
368 In May, 2009, the head of the U.S. Strategic Command, Air Force Gen. Kevin Chilton, stated that retali-
ation for a cyber attack would not necessarily be limited to cyberspace.
369 These deterrence strategies and requirements I took from a personal interview with Prof. Peter D. 
Feaver, Alexander F. Hehmeyer Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at Duke University and 
Director of the Triangle Institute for Security Studies (TISS).

NATION-STATE CYBER ATTACK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Denial: Capability
Despite the diplomatic efforts of NPT, the well-funded inspection regime of the In-
ternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)372 and unilateral military operations such 
as Israel’s destruction of nuclear facilities in Iraq in 1981 and in Syria in 2007, the 
size of the world’s nuclear club is growing. In addition to the five permanent mem-
bers of the United Nations Security Council,373 de facto members now include India, 
Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea.374
Cyber attack tools and techniques are not nearly as dangerous as their nuclear coun-
terparts, but they are by comparison simple to acquire, deploy, and hide. Hacker 
training and conferences are abundant; over the past 17 years, almost 1,000 how-to 
presentations have been given at DEF CON. More sensitive hacker information can 
be kept secret, physically transported on a miniscule hard drive, or sent encrypted 
across the Internet. A nuclear weapons program is difficult to hide;375 a cyber weap-
ons program is not. Cyber attacks can be tested discretely in a laboratory environ-
ment376 or live on the Internet, anonymously. Further, it appears increasingly com-
mon to outsource the illegal business of hacking to a commercial or criminal third 
party.377
A major challenge to cyber attack tool anti-proliferation is how to define malicious 
code. A legitimate path for remote system administration can also be used by a 
masquerading hacker to steal national secrets. Even published operating system 
and application code is difficult for experts to understand thoroughly, as there are 
simply too many lines of code to analyze.378 The dynamic and fast-evolving nature of 
cyber attack technology contrasts sharply with the fundamental design of nuclear 
warheads, which, with the exception of the neutron bomb, has not changed much 
since the late 1950s.379 In the single month of May 2009, Kaspersky Anti-Virus Lab 
372 The IAEA is the world’s nuclear inspectorate, with more than four decades of verification experience. 
Inspectors work to verify that safeguarded nuclear material and activities are not used for military 
purposes. The annual budget of IAEA is almost $500 million USD.

376 With nuclear weapons, a hard-to-conceal test is required to prove that a capability exists. If the goal 
were cyber attack tool anti-proliferation, it would seem difficult to know if or when success had been 
achieved.

gence” by a former intelligence agent and a for-hire computer hacker on behalf of some of France’s

reported that it had found 42,520 unique, suspicious programs on its clients’ com-
puters.
Finally, in nuclear warfare one of the most important considerations is the retention 
of a second-strike capability. Following a surprise attack, is it still possible for the 
victim to fight back? In nuclear and conventional warfare, this is a constant worry 
among strategic planners. In contrast, a unique characteristic of cyber attacks is 
their ability to be launched from anywhere in the world, at any time. During the 
cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007, most of the compromised and attacking comput-
ers were located in the United States.380 Cyber attacks can be set to launch under 
predetermined conditions or on a certain date in the future. Discovered attack tools 
can also be difficult to remove from a computer network completely, even by forensic 
experts. With cyber attack technology, it seems impossible to know for sure that all 
adversary attack options have been eliminated.
Denial: Communication
Cyber attacks now have the attention of the world’s national security planners. In 
the U.S., enhancing cyber security was one of the six “mission objectives” of the 
2009 Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) National Intelligence Strategy,381 and 
counteracting the cyber threat is currently the third-highest priority of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), after preventing terrorist attacks and thwarting for-
eign intelligence operations.
However, cyber warfare is a new phenomenon; national and international norms 
have yet to be established. Different approaches are under consideration. One is to 
broaden international law enforcement coordination, specifically via the Council of 
Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Objections to this strategy include the possible 
infringement of national sovereignty by foreign law enforcement agencies. Another 
approach is to prohibit the development of cyber weapons via international treaty,
