### Sun Tzu and the Virtue of Patience in Warfare

Sun Tzu emphasizes that avoiding a superior adversary is not an act of cowardice, but rather a sign of wisdom. Given the painstaking nature of objective calculations, patience is indeed a virtue. A victorious strategist seeks battle only after ensuring victory, whereas one destined for defeat fights first and then hopes for success. This principle is outlined in *The Art of War: IV. Tactical Dispositions*.

### Commanding a Cyber Corps

Leading a cyber corps requires a blend of admirable qualities. Cyberspace, as a battleground, offers both political and military leaders vast opportunities for success and failure. Behind its facade of global connectivity, the Internet's complex and vulnerable architecture makes it an ideal environment for conducting asymmetric and often anonymous military operations. Imagination and creativity are essential skills, as cyber warfare involves significant uncertainty. Even identifying an attack can be challenging, and the high tempo of Internet operations can lead to rapid burnout among personnel.

A cyber commander must possess a minimum level of subject matter expertise in IT, thoroughly understanding core concepts such as computing, networking, and data security. Effective communication is crucial; the leader must articulate the mission clearly so that all members of the organization understand and believe in it. Additionally, they must be able to communicate effectively with highly technical individuals, who have different needs compared to traditional military personnel.

### Coordinating Cyber and Non-Cyber Elements

In future conflicts, military leadership will face the challenge of coordinating and deconflicting the cyber and non-cyber elements of a battle plan. Sun Tzu praises the great tactician who, after assembling and concentrating forces, harmonizes the different elements before engaging in tactical maneuvers. As circumstances change, both tactics and strategy must be reevaluated and modified to fit the new environment. The ability to adapt tactics in response to the opponent is a hallmark of a skilled commander, as stated in *The Art of War: VI. Weak Points and Strong*.

The dynamic nature of the Internet and the speed of computer network operations necessitate faster decision cycles than a traditional chain-of-command can manage. A cyber commander must have the trust and authority from superiors to act quickly, creatively, and decisively.

### The Art of Cyber War: A New Framework

*The Art of War* is one of the most influential military treatises in human history, remaining relevant due to its flexible guidance. Strategists and tacticians have adapted its principles to new circumstances across many scientific revolutions. This chapter argues that cyber warfare practitioners should also use *The Art of War* as a guide to military strategy. However, cyberspace has unique characteristics that were unimaginable in ancient China. Here are ten distinctive aspects of the cyber battlefield:

1. **Artificial Environment**: The Internet can be shaped according to national security requirements.
2. **Rapid Proliferation**: The rapid development of Internet technologies, including hacker tools and tactics, makes it impossible for any organization to be familiar with all of them.
3. **Proximity Irrelevance**: Physical proximity loses relevance as cyber attacks can be launched regardless of terrestrial geography.
4. **Unpredictable Changes**: Frequent software updates and network reconfigurations change the Internet landscape unpredictably.
5. **Asymmetric Advantage**: The nature of cyber attacks favors the attacker.
6. **Flexibility**: Cyber attacks can be used for propaganda, espionage, and the destruction of critical infrastructure.
7. **Anonymity**: High degrees of anonymity make deterrence and retaliation strategies less credible.
8. **Covert Operations**: Lengthy and costly cyber wars can occur without public knowledge.
9. **Subjective Calculations**: The intangible nature of cyberspace complicates the calculation of victory, defeat, and battle damage.
10. **Moral Inhibitions**: There are few moral inhibitions to cyber warfare, as it primarily involves the use and exploitation of information.

These characteristics do not easily fit into Sun Tzuâ€™s paradigm. National security thinkers and military strategists must be aware of these differences as they develop concepts, strategies, and doctrines for cyber warfare.

### Deterrence in Cyber Attacks

National security planners are shifting from reactive, tactical cyber defense to proactive, strategic cyber defense, which may include international military deterrence. While cyber attacks do not compare to nuclear explosions, they pose a serious and increasing threat to international security. This chapter examines the two deterrence strategies (denial and punishment) and their three basic requirements (capability, communication, and credibility) in the context of cyber warfare. It also explores whether the challenges of attribution and asymmetry make cyber attack deterrence an impossible task.

#### Cyber Attacks and Deterrence Theory

The advent of nuclear weapons disrupted the historical logic of war, leading to the emergence of deterrence theory. The purpose of armies shifted from winning wars to preventing them. Although cyber attacks do not match the destructive power of a nuclear blast, they can achieve a wide range of political and military objectives, making proactive deterrence essential.

#### Challenges in Deterrence

**Denial by Denial**: This strategy aims to prevent adversaries from acquiring threatening technology. While effective in the nuclear sphere, it is difficult to apply to cyber attacks due to the ease of acquiring, deploying, and hiding cyber tools. Hacker training and conferences are abundant, and malicious code can be hidden and tested discretely.

**Communication**: Establishing clear norms and communication channels is crucial. International law enforcement coordination and treaties are being considered, but challenges such as national sovereignty and the fast-evolving nature of cyber threats complicate these efforts.

In conclusion, while *The Art of War* provides valuable insights, the unique characteristics of cyberspace require a new framework for effective cyber warfare and deterrence.
