Survey on resource usage of logging systems 
Dear colleagues, we are researchers from Microsoft Research. Currently, we are conducting research on improving logging systems in large-scale distributed systems, which aims to enable highly efficient and effective logging with negligible overhead. We are conducting this survey to gain better understanding of the characteristics of existing logging practice in different production systems, especially with respect to the resource consumption of logging systems and its solutions. We warmly welcome your participation and we highly appreciate your taking 10-15 minutes to give us valuable feedback!Note: This survey consists of 33 questions, which will take you about 10~15 minutes to finish.
