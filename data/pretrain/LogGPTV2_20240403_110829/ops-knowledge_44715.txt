User: I would like to write a script to automate a task which I do manually everyday. This task requires me to download some files from a UNIX server (Solaris) to my desktop (Windows XP) using WinSCP. Is there any way to copy/move the files from a path in the UNIX server to a path in my Windows XP PC using Python or shell script?
Assistant: Have you considered using Cygwin together with rsync? You could write a small bash script that uses rsync to fetch the files you need, and run this as a daily cron job.
