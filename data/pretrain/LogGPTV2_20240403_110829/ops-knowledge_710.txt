User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does Google log my activity on service A when logged in to service B or by IP address? Now that Google's new Privacy Policy will combine data from their various services...

Will Google associate me to my activity on one service even if I am not logged in to that service? Did they always do this?

With the new policy I suspect that if I am logged in and Google search for kittens I may get suggested even more kitten videos when I next visit YouTube. More importantly kitten related advertisements. But what if I was not logged in to search?

A specific example that comes to mind is, if I log in (YouTube/Gmail) at an IP address say at home (maybe on my phone, maybe the same PC) will Google now associate every Search I make to that account even though I am not logged in on that browser at that time?

Yes, Google will be able to log your activity mutually through services. You do not even need to be logged. For example I was searching on Google for "online kids game" for my little cousin to play, later that evening I was using Youtube as usual and I was shown Kids Toys Advertisment for the first time on Youtube, coincidence (I wasn't even logged)? I doubt it.

Check out my answer on this question, I also give deeper details and info on how to protect your identity. Does Google record search / source IP [/ user] pairs?
