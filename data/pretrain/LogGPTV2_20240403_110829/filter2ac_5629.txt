### Title: Blackhat US-22 Stalloris: RPKI Downgrade Attack

The recent hijacking of a Twitter prefix by RTCOMM highlighted the critical role of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in ensuring Internet routing security. RPKI filtering, also known as Route Origin Validation (ROV), implemented by major networks, significantly limited the propagation of the hijacked prefix. 

In this paper, we present the first known downgrade attacks against RPKI, which enable remote adversaries to disable RPKI validation, thereby exposing networks to prefix hijacks. Our attack involves a malicious RPKI publication point that stalls the relying party implementations, effectively disabling RPKI validation on those networks.

We demonstrate that all current RPKI relying party implementations are vulnerable to such attacks from a malicious publication point. This vulnerability affects 20.4% of the IPv4 address space. We provide recommendations for mitigating these downgrade attacks. However, addressing the fundamental issue is complex: if relying parties prioritize security over connectivity and insist on RPKI validation even when Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) cannot be retrieved, the victim Autonomous System (AS) may become disconnected from many more networks than just the one targeted by the adversary.

Our findings underscore the importance of RPKI publication points as a critical infrastructure for both Internet connectivity and security. Therefore, our primary recommendation is that these publication points should be hosted on robust platforms that ensure a high degree of connectivity and reliability.
