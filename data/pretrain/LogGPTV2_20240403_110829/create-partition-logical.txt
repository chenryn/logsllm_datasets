### Create Logical Partition

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
This command creates a logical partition within an existing extended partition on a Master Boot Record (MBR) disk. Once the partition is created, the focus automatically shifts to the new partition.

**Important Notes:**
- This command is applicable only to MBR disks.
- You must use the `select disk` command to select a basic MBR disk and shift the focus to it.
- An extended partition must be created before you can create logical drives.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
create partition logical [size=<size>] [offset=<offset>] [align=<alignment>] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **size=**  
  Specifies the size of the logical partition in megabytes (MB). The specified size must be smaller than the available space in the extended partition. If no size is provided, the partition will continue until there is no more free space in the extended partition.

- **offset=**  
  Specifies the offset in kilobytes (KB) at which the partition is created. The offset is rounded up to completely fill the cylinder size used. If no offset is given, the partition is placed in the first available disk extent that can accommodate it. The partition will be at least as long in bytes as the size specified. If a size is specified for the logical partition, it must be smaller than the extended partition.

- **align=**  
  Aligns all volume or partition extents to the closest alignment boundary, typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN) arrays to improve performance. The value is the number of kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest alignment boundary.

- **noerr**  
  For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**
To create a logical partition of 1000 megabytes in size within the extended partition of the selected disk, use the following command:
```plaintext
create partition logical size=1000
```

This command will create a logical partition of 1000 MB in the extended partition of the currently selected disk.
