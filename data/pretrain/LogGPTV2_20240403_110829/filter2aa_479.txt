About the Title
 From StartCom Critical Event Report

 Thanks to StartCom for quickly fixing 
the bug I found
 These guys care about PKI!

Intro – SSL vs SSL PKI
 SSL is a sound encryption protocol
 …implementation specific bugs, aside
 Debian PRNG
 Microsoft SSL PCT Overflow (2004)
 SSL PKI gives us third party trust
 Site validation
 Code signing
 Personal certificates

Intro – Why hack PKI?
 To exploit third-party trust
 Maybe you own the DNS
 Steal data with minimal residue
 Targeted Attacks
 SSL VPN
 If software vendors do their job, 
endpoints will be harder to attack
 It’s fun!

Intro – PKI’s Low Hanging Fruit
 Certification Authority Web Sites
 You pay money for private key access
 Private key access is controlled by web 
application logic
 Web Applications are hard to secure
 Oh, the irony!
 The companies that sell security are not 
secure themselves
 How can you secure the Internet, over 
the Internet?

Domain Validation
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
20
Domain Validation
 CAs need to make sure you are 
authorized to request certification
 A few different techniques
 Phone Authentication
 Email Authentication
 Both rely on secret codes
 Attacker requests a certificate
 CA sends secret to authorized contact
 Only those who know the secret can 
authorize the request
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
21
Domain Validation
 How does a CA determine who is an 
authorized contact?
 Out of band (but still on the Internet)
 Email address  and/or phone number from 
Domain Registration Records
 Certificate Requestor can pick from a list 
of approved aliases
 Webmaster, ssladmin, sslwebmaster, etc. 
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
22
Domain Validation
 Choosing the Authorized Contact
 Attack #1
 Take advantage of insecure protocols to 
alter domain registration data on the wire
 Controls relying on insecure protocols 
should not be considered out of band
 Attack #2
 Take advantage of poor application logic
 Controls cannot rely on user-supplied data
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
23
Domain Validation
 Delivery of the shared secret
 Over the phone
 ?
 Over email
 More reliance on insecure protocols
 Who determines what aliases are 
authorized to approve SSL certification?
 Multiple Opportunities for Attack
 Sniff email on the wire
 Break into an email account
 Free email providers

Certificate Provisioning Process
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
25
Certificate Provisioning Process
 CAs want to make money
 Automation lowers overhead and makes 
purchasing certificates easier for 
customers
 “Race to the Bottom”
 The easier it is to get a cert, the less we 
can trust them (Hello EV!)
 Automation makes life easier on 
attackers
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
26
Certificate Provisioning Process
 Case Study: Chosen Pre-Fix Collisions 
 Attack against a CA yields a rogue 
Certificate Authority
 Two weaknesses
 Use of MD5
 Researchers could control serial number 
and time stamp
 Web Site automation provided a reliable 
mechanism for generating predictable 
SSL certificates
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
27
Certificate Provisioning Process
 Case Study: Chosen Pre-Fix Collisions 
 These would have helped
 A strong CAPTCHA
 Introduce a human element to the process
 A random time delay
 Prevent the requestor from controlling the time 
the certificate is issued.
Intrepidus Group, Inc. © 2008
28
Certificate Provisioning Process
 Case Study: No Validation 
 Comodo COMPLETELY disabled validation 
 This happened for one reseller (that we 
know of)
 People who ordered certificates had them 
immediately issued
 Result: a rogue certificate was issued for 
mozilla.org
 Automation makes it easier to make $$$
 It also makes it easy screw things up

Certificate Provisioning Process
 The Black List
 CAs will use a black list to protect 
sensitive domains
 I know, for a fact, that Verisign.com is 
on some black lists 
 Issues
 Who is on the black list?
 How do you get on the black list?
 Good for PayPal.com
 Bad for vpn.governmentcontractor.com

 Insecure Direct Object Reference
 Used to by-pass StartCom Domain

 Most CAs that offer domain validation do 
so via email

 By-passed validation and received signed 
certificates for low-profile sites
 By-passed validation for high-profile 
sites PayPal and Verisign
 Certificates were not issued for PayPal & 
Verisign due to a BLACKLIST

 EV SSL & SSL Rebinding
 Mixed Content policies do not distinguish 
DV SSL from EV SSL
 SSL Rebinding attacks allow for EV MITM 
with only a valid DV certificate
 Browsers cannot handle CA’s “tiers of 
trust”
 How do we fix this going forward?
Client Side Countermeasures
 White Listing Pubic Keys
 Perspectives Plug-in
 Not perfect
 Client side proxies to handle white listing 
is a better option
