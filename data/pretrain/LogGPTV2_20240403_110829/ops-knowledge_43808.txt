The provided system log, spanning from July 30 to July 31, 2015, documents various activities and events related to a ZooKeeper server. Here is a step-by-step summary of the key points:

1. **Session Establishment and Connection Requests:**
   - A client at `/10.10.34.21:37904` attempts to establish a new session (July 30, 21:03:47).
   - The server establishes a session `0x14edfaa86f60013` with a timeout of 10,000ms for a client at `/10.10.34.27:44600` (July 31, 00:17:52).

2. **Socket Connections and Disconnections:**
   - A socket connection is closed for a client at `/10.10.34.17:51214` with session ID `0x14ede63a5a70053` (July 30, 23:03:42).
   - Another socket connection is closed for a client at `/10.10.34.13:54485` with session ID `0x14edfaa86f60021` (July 31, 11:01:40).
   - A new socket connection is accepted from a client at `/10.10.34.12:34568` (July 31, 11:01:54).

3. **Session Expiration:**
   - Sessions `0x34ede65503f005c` and `0x24ede63a01b0062` expire due to a timeout of 10,000ms (July 30, 23:03:52 and 23:03:54).

4. **Quorum and Election Issues:**
   - The server enters the `LOOKING` state, indicating it is trying to elect a leader (July 30, 23:43:23).
   - Multiple warnings are logged about the inability to open channels to election addresses `/10.10.34.12:3888` and `/10.10.34.13:3888` (July 30, 23:44:01, 23:44:04, and 23:44:58).
   - A warning is issued about interrupting a `SendWorker` (July 30, 23:49:40).
   - A notification timeout of 60,000ms is logged (July 30, 23:52:26).

5. **Connection Requests from Old Clients:**
   - Several warnings are logged about connection requests from old clients (`/10.10.34.40:40996`, `/10.10.34.16:39498`, `/10.10.34.25:58975`, and `/10.10.34.33:39730`). These connections will be dropped if the server is in read-only mode (July 31, 00:02:57, 00:19:37, 11:01:57, and 11:09:01).

6. **End of Stream Exceptions:**
   - Two `end of stream` exceptions are caught (July 31, 00:19:18 and 00:19:19).

In summary, the log indicates that the ZooKeeper server is managing session establishment, expiration, and socket connections, while also encountering issues with quorum and election processes, and handling connection requests from older clients.
