User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Problem with deploying django application on mod_wsgi I seem to have a problem deploying django with mod_wsgi. In the past I've used mod_python but I want to make the change. I have been using Graham Dumpleton notes here http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango1, but it still seem to not work. I get a Internal Server Error.

django.wsgi file:

import os
import sys

sys.path.append('/var/www/html')
sys.path.append('/var/www/html/c2duo_crm')

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'c2duo_crm.settings'
import django.core.handlers.wsgi
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/c2duo_crm/apache/django.wsgi


Apache httpd file:   

&lt;Directory /var/www/html/c2duo_crm/apache&gt;
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;


In my apache error log, it says I have this error This is not all of it, but I've got the most important part:

[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/.python-eggs'
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] The Python egg cache directory is currently set to:
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]   /.python-eggs
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  You can
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] change the cache directory by setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment
[Thu Mar 03 14:59:25 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] variable to point to an accessible directory.

Assistant: You can set the WSGI variable for this.  In your Apache config:

WSGIPythonEggs /var/tmp


This is the same as setting the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable which, as pointed out in topdog's answer, only works with mod_python.
