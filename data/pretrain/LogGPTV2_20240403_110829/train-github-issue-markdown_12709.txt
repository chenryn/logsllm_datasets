if you load a gltf model with some skinned animation and then try to clone
that mesh - you will find yourself in a bit of a pickle!
Skinned geometry loaded with GLTF has no "bones" property, which is expected
by "SkinnedMesh", see:  
three.js/src/objects/SkinnedMesh.js
Lines 38 to 47 in 17264b9
|  initBones: function () {  
---|---  
|  
|  var bones = [], bone, gbone;  
|  var i, il;  
|  
|  if ( this.geometry && this.geometry.bones !== undefined ) {  
|  
|  // first, create array of 'Bone' objects from geometry data  
|  
|  for ( i = 0, il = this.geometry.bones.length; i < il; i ++ ) {  
so you'll end up with a skinned mesh, alright, but your character will have no
spine! ..or any other bones for that matter. From my experience - the mesh
will not render at all as a result.
