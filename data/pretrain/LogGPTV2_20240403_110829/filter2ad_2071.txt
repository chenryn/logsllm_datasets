## Abstract
Prefix hijacking is a prevalent issue in the Internet, often leading to routing disruptions and financial losses. In this demonstration, we introduce ARTEMIS, a tool designed to enable network administrators to detect and mitigate prefix hijacking incidents targeting their own prefixes. ARTEMIS leverages real-time monitoring of BGP data and software-defined networking (SDN) principles to fully mitigate a prefix hijacking within a few minutes (e.g., 5-6 minutes in our experiments) after it has been initiated.

### CCS Concepts
- **Networks:** Network management, Network monitoring
- **Security and privacy:** Network security

## 1. Introduction
The Internet comprises thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes), with inter-domain traffic routed using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Due to BGP's distributed nature and lack of authorization, an AS can advertise illegitimate paths or prefixes owned by other ASes, resulting in prefix hijacking. This can cause significant routing issues and economic losses. For example, YouTube's prefixes were hijacked in 2008, disrupting its services for over two hours [1], and China Telecom hijacked 37,000 prefixes (about 10% of the BGP table) in 2010, causing widespread routing problems for several minutes [2].

Prefix hijacking, whether due to an attack or misconfiguration, is a common occurrence. Since prevention is not always feasible, mechanisms for detection and mitigation are essential. Several methodologies have been proposed for detecting prefix hijackings, such as [3, 4]. However, most existing solutions focus on alert systems that are not directly controlled by the AS itself [3, 4], and primarily aim to accurately detect BGP hijacks rather than to promptly detect and mitigate them. The current detection and mitigation cycle involves significant delays:
- Aggregated BGP data from sources like RouteViews [5] or RIPE RIS [6] is available every 2 hours (BGP full RIBs) or 15 minutes (BGP updates).
- Network administrators receiving notifications from third-party alert systems must manually verify if the notification indicates a hijacking or is a false alarm.
- For mitigation, administrators often need to manually reconfigure routers or contact other AS administrators to filter announcements. For instance, YouTube took about 80 minutes to respond to the hijacking of its prefixes.

These delays make existing mechanisms inefficient, especially for short-lived hijacking events (more than 20% of hijacks last less than 5 minutes, as observed in [3]). ARTEMIS addresses these issues by providing near real-time detection and automatic mitigation.

## 2. System Overview
ARTEMIS is designed to provide real-time detection and automatic mitigation of BGP prefix hijacking. The system consists of the following components:
- **Real-time BGP Monitoring:** ARTEMIS continuously monitors BGP data from multiple vantage points to detect any anomalies in prefix announcements.
- **Detection Algorithm:** A sophisticated algorithm analyzes BGP data to identify potential hijacking incidents. The detection is based on comparing the observed routes with the expected legitimate routes.
- **Automatic Mitigation:** Upon detecting a hijacking, ARTEMIS automatically triggers mitigation actions, such as updating BGP policies and filtering out the illegitimate routes. This process is facilitated by SDN principles, allowing for rapid and efficient mitigation.

## 3. Experimental Evaluation
We evaluated ARTEMIS using the PEERING testbed, which allows us to perform realistic hijacking experiments. Our experiments demonstrated that ARTEMIS can detect and mitigate prefix hijacking within a few minutes (e.g., 5-6 minutes in our tests). The detection is faster because it requires only one observation of the bogus route, while the mitigation is completed when all routers have updated to the legitimate route. This performance significantly outperforms existing methods, which often take much longer to complete the detection and mitigation cycle.

## 4. Demonstration
The goal of the demo is to showcase the real-time detection and mitigation capabilities of ARTEMIS on the actual Internet. We will use ARTEMIS over the PEERING testbed to conduct hijacking experiments. Using the monitoring service, we will visualize in real-time how the hijacking incident propagates across the Internet, affecting networks and redirecting traffic to the illegitimate AS. The effect of the mitigation will be demonstrated through a geographical visualization of vantage points around the globe, showing the transition from the illegitimate to the legitimate origin-AS.
