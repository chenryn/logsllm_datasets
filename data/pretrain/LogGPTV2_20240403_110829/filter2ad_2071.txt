ABSTRACT
Preﬁx hijacking is a common phenomenon in the Internet
that often causes routing problems and economic losses. In
this demo, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables net-
work administrators to detect and mitigate preﬁx hijacking
incidents, against their own preﬁxes. ARTEMIS is based
on the real-time monitoring of BGP data in the Internet,
and software-deﬁned networking (SDN) principles, and can
completely mitigate a preﬁx hijacking within a few minutes
(e.g., 5-6mins in our experiments) after it has been launched.
CCS Concepts
•Networks → Network management; Network monitor-
ing; •Security and privacy → Network security;

INTRODUCTION
The Internet is composed of thousands of Autonomous
Systems (ASes), whose inter-domain trafﬁc is routed with
the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Due to the distributed
nature and lack of authorization in BGP, an AS can adver-
tise illegitimate paths or preﬁxes owned by other ASes, i.e.,
hijacking their preﬁxes. Preﬁx hijacking can cause serious
routing problems and economic losses. For instance, YouTube’s
preﬁxes were hijacked in 2008 disrupting its services for
more than 2 hours [1], whereas China Telecom hijacked 37000
preﬁxes (about 10% of the BGP table) in 2010 causing rout-
ing problems in the whole Internet for several minutes [2].
Preﬁx hijacking (due to an attack or misconﬁguration) is
a common phenomenon in the Internet, and since its pre-
vention is not always possible, mechanisms for its detec-
tion and mitigation are needed. To this end, several method-
ologies for detecting preﬁx hijackings have been proposed,
e.g.,
[3, 4]. However, most previous works focus on alert
systems that are not controlled by the AS itself [3, 4], but

offer BGP preﬁx hijacking detection as a service to ASes.
In addition, previous research focuses primarily on accu-
rately detecting BGP hijacks, rather than timely detecting
and mitigating them. The whole detection/mitigation cy-
cle presently has signiﬁcant delay: (i) aggregated BGP data
from RouteViews [5] or RIPE RIS [6], which are commonly-
used for detection, become available approximately every 2
hours (BGP full RIBs) or 15mins (BGP updates); (ii) a net-
work administrator that receives a notiﬁcation from a third-
party alert system needs to manually process it to verify if
the notiﬁcation corresponds to a hijacking or is a false alarm;
and (iii) for mitigation, administrators often need to man-
ually reconﬁgure routers or contact administrators of other
ASes to ﬁlter announcements. YouTube, for example, re-
acted about 80min after the hijacking of its preﬁxes. These
problems render existing mechanisms inefﬁcient especially
for a large percentage of hijacking events that last only for a
short time (cf., more than 20% of hijacks last  80% of the hijacking cases
observed in [3]). The detection is faster because it needs at
least one observation of the bogus route, while the mitigation
is completed when every router has the legitimate route.
4. DEMO
The goal of the demo is to show that it possible to detect
and mitigate BGP preﬁx hijackings in near real-time on the
actual Internet. We will use ARTEMIS over the PEERING
testbed to perform hijacking experiments, like in Section 3.
Using the monitoring service of ARTEMIS, we will visual-
ize in real-time how the hijacking incident propagates in the
Internet, turning affected networks into the illegitimate AS.
This, as well as the effect of the mitigation, will be demon-
strated with a geographical visualization of vantage points
around the globe that select the (il-)legitimate origin-AS.
