ABSTRACT
Syntactic data anonymization strives to (i) ensure that an adversary
cannot identify an individual’s record from published attributes with
high probability, and (ii) provide high data utility. These mutu-
ally conﬂicting goals can be expressed as an optimization problem
with privacy as the constraint and utility as the objective function.
Conventional research using the k-anonymity model has resorted
to publishing data in homogeneous generalized groups. A recently
proposed alternative does not create such cliques; instead, it recasts
data values in a heterogeneous manner, aiming for higher utility.
Nevertheless, such works never deﬁned the problem in the most
general terms; thus, the utility gains they achieve are limited. In this
paper, we propose a methodology that achieves the full potential
of heterogeneity and gains higher utility while providing the same
privacy guarantee. We formulate the problem of maximal-utility k-
anonymization by freeform generalization as a network ﬂow prob-
lem. We develop an optimal solution therefor using Mixed Integer
Programming. Given the non-scalability of this solution, we de-
velop an O(kn2) Greedy algorithm that has no time-complexity
disadvantage vis-á-vis previous approaches, an O(kn2 log n) en-
hanced version thereof, and an O(kn3) adaptation of the Hungar-
ian algorithm; these algorithms build a set of k perfect matchings
from original to anonymized data, a novel approach to the problem.
Moreover, our techniques can resist adversaries who may know the
employed algorithms. Our experiments with real-world data ver-
ify that our schemes achieve near-optimal utility (with gains of up
to 41%), while they can exploit parallelism and data partitioning,
gaining an efﬁciency advantage over simpler methods.

INTRODUCTION
The imperative to protect the privacy of individuals [27] requires
that a certain privacy guarantee be observed when sharing data
among agents such as public organizations and private corpora-
tions, while disclosing as much information as possible. A popular
such guarantee is provided by the k-anonymity model, which re-
quires that the records in a released table should be recast, so that
any combination of values on a set of quasi-identifying attributes
(QI) can be indistinctly matched to at least k (or none) individuals

therein [24]. This model has been extended and specialized in sev-
eral forms [23, 20, 7, 6] and other alternatives have been suggested
[12, 8]; however, k-anonymity remains a fundamental prerequisite
of more advanced models and useful as a stand-alone device in
its own right. For example, microtargeted advertising systems in
online social networks, even while refraining from selling users’
personal information to advertisers, may still inadvertently reveal
a user’s personal information when an adversary targets an adver-
tisement to a particular user’s set of quasi-identiﬁer values [17].
A remedy for this problem requires privacy protections built in by
design. Such a protection would be to ensure that an advertiser’s
targeting criteria never ﬁt less than k user proﬁles, i.e., to apply the
advertising criteria on k-anonymized data indeed. Therefore, the
k-anonymity model remains topical and relevant in novel settings,
and preferable to noise addition techniques in many cases [21, 10].
Despite its usefulness in principle, a concern about the appli-
cability of k-anonymity in practice has been caused by a percep-
tion that the loss of data utility it engenders would be too large to
bear [5], an effect exacerbated as the number of dimensions (QI
attributes) grows [2]. However, such loss in utility does not nec-
essarily arise from an inherent drawback of the model itself, but
rather from the deﬁciencies of the algorithms used to implement the
model. Indeed, conventional microdata anonymization algorithms
have typically departed from the assumption that all recast records
whose QI values are meant to match the original values of a record
t must be assigned identical QI values to each other [24]; thereby,
sanitized records are clustered in disjoint homogeneous groups of
the same QI values, called equivalence classes [24]. Brickell and
Shmatikov ﬁrst discerned that “there is no privacy reason” for this
homogeneity requirement [5]; they speculated that a strategy using
directed acyclic graphs may fare better. In our view, the message
to be drawn from [2] and [5] is not a negative, pessimist view that
obtaining higher data utility under k-anonymity is impossible, but
rather a call for k-anonymization algorithms that do obtain higher
data utility by dropping the constraints of previous research. More-
over, we argue that such utility may also be gained at the expense
of runtime, if a tradeoff between the two emerges. As the anony-
mization process is an one-off process, some additional runtime is
always worth investing for the sake of obtaining higher utility.
This paper provides such algorithms. We observe that some at-
tempts already made in this direction [16, 28, 25, 29, 9] do not
deﬁne the problem in the most general terms; they introduce super-
ﬂuous constraints in their solutions or solve the problem by triv-
ially suppressing some values. We keep away from such super-
ﬂuities and explore the potential to obtain high data utility by value
generalization under the k-anonymity model. We deﬁne the prob-
lem of optimal-utility k-anonymization by value generalization as
a network ﬂow problem, a generalization of the assignment prob-

lem on a bipartite graph. To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to
formulate this problem in such terms. We develop an exact optimal
solution therefor using Mixed Integer Programming. As this so-
lution does not scale, we propose a scalable Greedy algorithm, an
enhanced version thereof, and a computationally more demanding
solution employing the Hungarian algorithm for the Assignment
Problem. We also examine whether an off-the-shelf algorithm for
the minimum-cost network ﬂow problem can provide a viable solu-
tion to our problem. Last, we demonstrate that our techniques can
gain an efﬁciency advantage over simpler methods, when applied
in a distributed environment, after partitioning the data.

Our approach differs from preceding research in the form of its
solutions, which provide better utility, while it provides the same
privacy guarantee and recasts data values in the same syntactic way
as previous research. A recasting of tuples can be represented by a
directed graph, the generalization graph [29], that shows how the
values of original records match those of anonymized ones. In the
bipartite view of the graph, an edge from the vertex standing for
an original record, ri, to the one standing for a recast record, r(cid:2)
j,
indicates that the QI values of ri are included in (match) those of
r(cid:2)
j. In the uniﬁed view, a single vertex represents both the original
record ri and its recast form r(cid:2)
i.
Figure 1(a) shows the kind of generalization graph constructed
by conventional k-anonymization algorithms obeying the homo-
geneity requirement [24, 19, 15]. In the bipartite view, the partition-
ing forms two disconnected complete subgraphs of four vertices
in each side (i.e., two K4,4 bicliques), hence obeys 4-anonymity.
These subgraphs correspond to the equivalence classes formed by
those methods; in the uniﬁed view, they appear as complete di-
graphs with self-loops. Previous works [28, 29] eschewed the re-
dundant homogeneity requirement so as to achieve higher utility;
still, they resorted to another superﬂuous requirement, namely that
the generalization graph be a ring: a cyclical order of vertices is de-
ﬁned, and each vertex matches its predecessors and/or successors
over this order. Figure 1(b) shows such a graph.
We propose that homogeneity be eschewed without introducing
any other constraint in its place. A corollary of homogeneity is reci-
procity [29]: when record ri matches the recast form r(cid:2)
j of another
record rj, then rj matches r(cid:2)
i too; thus, the generalization graph
is symmetric. To illustrate the distinction between the two, Figure
1(c) shows a generalization graph that is reciprocal (records match
each other mutually), but heterogenous (no record has the same
matchings as another). Going further, we can eschew reciprocity
too, and aim to construct an entirely unconstrained generalization
graph that maximizes utility by value generalization. To our knowl-
edge, our work is the ﬁrst to deﬁne this problem in such terms. A
freeform generalization is illustrated by the graph in Figure 1(d).
The advantages of our approach are illustrated by the example
in Table 1. The top table presents the values of eight tuples on QI
attributes Age and Salary. By our method, these tuples are anony-
mized as in the bottom left table; each tuple is recast to a range
of values, so as to be compatible with, or match, three original tu-
ples, and vice versa, as the bottom right table shows; this property
is called 3-regularity. This property and a randomization scheme
guarantee that each original tuple has three equiprobable identities
[28]; thus, k-regularity is a sufﬁcient condition for k-anonymity.
Figure 2(a) presents the data of Table 1 in a 2d coordinate system
where the x-axis stands for Age and the y-axis for Salary. Each tu-
ple ti is represented as a point ri in this coordinate system (shown
by a black circle in the ﬁgure). An arrow from ri to rj denotes
that ri matches the anonymized tuple for rj. The matching rela-
tionships in Table 1 are thus shown in Figure 2(a). For clarity, we
present the same matchings in pure (uniﬁed) graph form as well,
without positioning points by their coordinates, in Figure 2(b).
