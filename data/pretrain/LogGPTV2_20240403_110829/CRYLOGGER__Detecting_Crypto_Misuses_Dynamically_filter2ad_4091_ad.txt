(Part 1) Comparison of CRYLOGGER and CryptoGuard [6] on 150 Android apps. Each graph is an upset plot [53]. The horizontal bars indicate the

number of apps Ô¨Çagged as vulnerable by CryptoGuard and CRYLOGGER (that is run with 10k, 30k and 50k stimuli). The vertical bars indicate the number of
apps Ô¨Çagged as vulnerable by a possible intersection of the four approaches (the three largest, non-empty intersections are reported). For example, for R-02: 2
apps are considered vulnerable by all approaches, 14 apps are Ô¨Çagged as vulnerable by CryptoGuard, but not by CRYLOGGER, and Ô¨Ånally 7 apps are considered
vulnerable by CRYLOGGER only. The vertical bars distinguish the false positives (fp) obtained by reverse engineering and the true positives (tp) for CryptoGuard.
intersections of the sets of apps that are considered vulnerable
by each approach. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, each vertical bar indicates the
size of the intersection of the sets whose circles below the bar
are black. For example, for rule R-03: the 3 conÔ¨Ågurations of
CRYLOGGER identiÔ¨Åed 16 crypto misuses that were not found
by CryptoGuard; CryptoGuard detected 13 misuses that were
not found by the 3 conÔ¨Ågurations of CRYLOGGER, and Ô¨Ånally
all the approaches agree that 4 apps are vulnerable. The vertical
bars for CryptoGuard distinguish the false positives (fp) from
the true positives (tp), because CryptoGuard can produce false
positives. To make this distinction, we reverse engineered the
apps by using APKTool8 and veriÔ¨Åed if the API calls Ô¨Çagged as
vulnerable by CryptoGuard could actually be called at runtime.
We used a very conservative approach to determine the false
positives. Starting from the Ô¨Çagged API call, we recursively
built the sets of functions that call that API until we obtained a
Ô¨Åxed point. If a function that is part of the package of the app
is in the set, then we considered the API call a true positive
because there is the possibility that it could be called at runtime.
If none of the functions in the set is part of the package of the
app, then we considered the API call a false positive. If the app
was completely obfuscated with ProGuard9, thereby making it
impossible to determine its packages, then we assumed that the
vulnerability Ô¨Çagged by CryptoGuard was a true positive. In
our case 6 apps were completely obfuscated. This process does

not guarantee that all false positives are identiÔ¨Åed because some
paths in the code of the app could still be not executable (dead
code), but it helps to Ô¨Ånd the obvious sources of false positives.
For most of the rules, excluding some cases (R-01, R-18,
R-22, R-24, R-25 and R-26), we can observe the following:
(1) CryptoGuard detected some crypto misuses that were
not found by CRYLOGGER; (2) CRYLOGGER detected some
misuses that were not found by CryptoGuard; (3) the number of
misuses detected by CRYLOGGER is higher than CryptoGuard,
considering that the latter produces many false positives (we
discuss some examples of false positives in Section VIII-D). For
some rules (R-01, R-18) we can observe that all the misuses
detected by CryptoGuard were also discovered by CRYLOGGER.
For other rules (R-22, R-24, R-25 and R-26) we can observe
that CryptoGuard found more crypto misuses compared to
CRYLOGGER, but it produced a signiÔ¨Åcant number of false
positives (in some cases the false positive rate is > 50%). These
rules are related to SSL/TLS and they require to evaluate the
security of the actual implementation of some Java functions,
for example, the function verify in the case of rule R-24 or
the functions checkClientTrusted, checkServerTrusted
and getAcceptedIssuers in the case of rule R-25. These
tasks are better suited for static analysis because it is necessary to
prove that some parameters of the functions are never used or the
parameters of the functions do not inÔ¨Çuence the return value [6].
Overall, these results show that CRYLOGGER can complement
the results that are obtained through static analysis and it can
