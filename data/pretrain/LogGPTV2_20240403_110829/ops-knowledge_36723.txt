User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to restart apache2 server I'm unable to run sudo service apache2 restart on my sever. Inorder to troubleshoot this when I execute sudo systemctl status apache2.service and I get the following log.

   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/apache2.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

How can I resolve this issue ?

NOTE : the actual domain name is replaced with domainname.

Assistant: Some other process is already using port 80. To find out what process it is do a 

netstat -tulpen | grep 80


In the right column of the output you will see the name and id of the process blocking the port. In order to be able to start the apache2 service you have to stop (or kill) it.
