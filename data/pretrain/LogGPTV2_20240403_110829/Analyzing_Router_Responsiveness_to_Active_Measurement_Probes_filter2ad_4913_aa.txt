Abstract. Active probing has increasingly been used to collect informa-
tion about the topological and functional characteristics of the Internet.
Given the need for active probing and the lack of a widely accepted mech-
anism to minimize the overhead of such probes, the traﬃc and processing
overhead introduced on the routers are believed to become an important
issue for network operators. In this paper, we conduct an experimental
study to understand the responsiveness of routers to active probing both
from a historical perspective and current practices. One main ﬁnding is
that network operators are increasingly conﬁguring their devices not to
respond to active direct probes. In addition, ICMP based probes seem
to elicit most responses and UDP based probes elicit the least.
Keywords: Internet measurement, active measurements.
1 Introduction
Internet has become one of the largest man made systems with a signiﬁcant im-
pact in many aspects of our daily life. Due to the tremendous growth in its size
and importance, many groups, organizations, and governments have become in-
terested in understanding various characteristics of the Internet for commercial,
social, and technical reasons. In general, Internet measurement studies can be
divided into two as (1) active measurement and (2) passive measurement studies.
Active measurement studies can also be divided into two as (1) the ones that
require participation from the network devices (i.e., routers) and (2) the ones
that involve end systems only.
Active measurement studies that require router participation typically send
measurement probes to routers and expect to receive responses from them. Nat-
urally, such probes incur processing and traﬃc overhead on the routers. Upon
receiving a probe message, a router is expected to create response packet and
send it back to the probe originator. Most routers perform this processing on
the slow forwarding path. This introduces a signiﬁcant processing overhead as
compared to simple packet forwarding on the fast forwarding path at the routers.
In addition to network measurement studies, today many popular overlay and
peer-to-peer network applications utilize active measurements to optimize their
topology and/or routing performance.

In this paper, we conduct an investigation on the responsiveness of routers
to active network measurements. Our goal is to quantify the responsiveness to
measurement activities in two directions (1) historical perspective in terms of
router participation in supporting active measurements and (2) today’s best
practices employed by network providers in allowing diﬀerent types of network
measurements on their routers. For the historical study, we use router anonymity
as observed in traceroute outputs and for today’s best practices we use diﬀerent
types of active probes and observe the responsiveness of routers to them.
For the historical study, we use path traces collected by skitter [11] and utilize
one trace set for each year starting 1999. We look at the ratio of occurrences of
‘*’s in each path trace in data sets and use these occurrences to indicate router
anonymity, i.e., lack of router participation to active probing. We study the data
set both before and after processing the raw data to build the corresponding
sample topology map (i.e., before and after resolving IP aliases and anonymous
routers). Our results show that there has been an increase in the ratio of router
anonymity in time and especially after the year of 2004. Our results also show
some interesting trends on the locality of anonymous routers in path traces.
For the analysis of current best practices, we collected a set of IP addresses
(536K+ of them) from a recent skitter and iPlane [10] measurement studies.
These IP addresses are known to respond to indirect probes by skitter and
iPlane systems. An indirect probe has a diﬀerent destination than the routers
that it elicit responses whereas a direct probe has a destination IP address
of the intended router. In our work, we send diﬀerent types of direct probe
messages to each of these IP addresses and observed their responsiveness. One
main observation we have is that routers are most responsive to ICMP based
active probes. This is followed by TCP and then by UDP based probes. We
also classiﬁed the IP addresses based on their top-level domain extensions and
observed that routers in diﬀerent type of organizations (e.g., .net, .com, .edu,
.org, and .gov) present a similar behavior in response to direct active probes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the
related work. Section 3 classiﬁes anonymity types. Section 4 present our obser-
vations on the historical data set. Section 5 presents our observations on the
current data set. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Related Work
Active probing has increasingly been used in various contexts to observe diﬀer-
ent characteristics of the underlying network. As an example, several research
studies utilize active probing to monitor the routing and reachability behavior
of the Internet in the inter-domain scale [9,11,13]. On the other hand, many
overlay or peer to peer network applications depend on active probing to op-
timize the performance of their applications [12]. Based on the increasing need
for active measurements, the research community has developed several large
scale distributed measurement platforms (e.g., ark [1], Dimes [13], DipZoom [15],
iPlane [10], PlanetLab [2], skitter [11], rocketfuel [14] etc.) that are commonly
used to conduct various measurement activities that include active probing.

As the volume of active measurement practices increased, several researchers
pointed out the impact/overhead of active probing in the network and presented
approaches to reduce the volume of redundant active probes in measurement
studies. Nakao et al. pointed out the increase in active measurement traﬃc
and proposed a routing underlay to unify all measurement activities [12]. In
this approach, overlay networks query the routing underlay for measurement
information and the routing underlay extracts and aggregates topology infor-
mation from the underlying network and uses this information to answer the
queries.
Within the speciﬁc context of traceroute based topology measurement studies,
Donnet et al. presented one of the early work on minimizing the active probing
overhead in traceroute based topology discovery [4,5]. This work presented dou-
bletree, a mechanism to avoid unnecessary probing of the same set of routers
multiple times in a traceroute based topology discovery. A follow up work by
Donnet et al. presented a modiﬁed approach called windowed doubletree that
improves on doubletree by extracting missing links/nodes in discovering a tar-
geted network topology [3]. More recently, Jin et al. considered scalable discovery
of the underlying network topology among a group of nodes that participate in
an overlay network [8]. Their main idea is to utilize a network coordinate system
in identifying path traces to collect at each overlay node so as to discover the
underlying topology while issuing the minimum number of path traces.
In summary, most of the related work in the area has been on reducing
the unnecessary overhead in active probing based topology discovery studies.
The main goal of the work presented in this paper is to quantify the responsive-
ness of routers to active probing based network measurement practices. The
results presented in this paper provide a historical perspective and demon-
strate the current practices of network operators to accommodate active network
measurements.
3 Types of Router Anonymity
In our work, we measure router unresponsiveness (i.e., anonymity) to active
probes. Active probes are divided into two types (1) direct probes and (2) indirect
probes. A direct probe is the one where the destination IP address in the probe
packet is the intended destination as in ICMP ping. An indirect probe is the one
where the destination IP address in the probe packet is some other destination
as in traceroute when it probes an intermediate router during the trace.
In both direct and indirect probing, eliciting a packet from probed node indi-
cates the responsiveness of the node. On the other hand, not receiving a response
to an active probe packet may have diﬀerent interpretations. In the case of di-
rect probing, the lack of a response message may not necessarily indicate node
anonymity as it may be that the probed node may be unreachable; may be dis-
connected or turned oﬀ; or either probe or the response packet may be ﬁltered
out at some node in the network. In the case of indirect probing as in traceroute,
the lack of a response message, in general, indicates node anonymity especially
if another responsive node appears later on within the same trace output.

We deﬁne several anonymity types for nodes/routers that we observed in our
experiments. Note that, both Type 1 and Type 2 can be further classiﬁed into
two types. However, as an observer there is no diﬀerence between them.
Type 1: A router may be conﬁgured to ignore certain probe packets causing
it to be anonymous with such probing. In addition, a border router may be
conﬁgured to ﬁlter out (i) certain types of packets (e.g., unsolicited UDP
packets directed to a local host) or (ii) outgoing ICMP responses originating
from nodes within its local domain. Filtering at the border causes the internal
nodes to be seen as anonymous as well.
Type 2: A router may apply ICMP rate limiting and become anonymous if the
rate of the incoming probes exceed the preset limit. Similarly, a router may
ignore probe packets when it is congested but may respond to them when it
is not congested. In either case, the router has changing responsiveness.
Type 3: A router may have a private (publicly unroutable) IP address. Such
IP addresses cannot guarantee node uniqueness and hence their originators
need to be considered as anonymous.
Finally, as the above discussion suggests, the classiﬁcation presented in this
paper are approximate in their nature as it is diﬃcult to know the actual cause
of a lack of response for an active probe packet.
4 Historical Perspective
In this section, we use traceroute collected historical data sets to study router
reaction to indirect probe messages. We downloaded 10 sets of ICMP traceroute
path traces from CAIDA’s skitter web site which is the only source we are
aware of publicly providing periodic historical topology data. These data sets
were collected within the ﬁrst collection cycle in January of the each year by the
skitter system. The web site reports that they had several updates to destination
IP address lists. They also had a major change in their topology collection system
in mid 2004 where they utilized dynamic destination lists with increased probing
frequency at skitter monitors.
In the ﬁrst step, we look for a trend in the ratio of anonymous routers in the
collected data set. We do this before and after processing the raw path traces.
Our processing in this context includes IP alias resolution and anonymous router
resolution tasks. For IP alias resolution, we use an analytical inference approach
called AAR [6]. Note that due to the historic nature of the data (i.e., due to the
fact that the underlying topology might have changed substantially in time), a
probe based IP alias resolution approach is not considered. The implication of
this limitation is that the resulting topology map may have inaccuracies due to
the limitations in alias resolution. Especially, data sets in 2001-2003 had much
fewer aliases which we think is due to poor alias resolution. For anonymous router
resolution, we use a graph-based induction (GBI) approach [7]. Table 1 presents
the main characteristics of the results where “#Srcs” indicate the number of
vantage points; “Reached” gives the percentage of traces that reached the ﬁnal

destination; “# Nodes” gives the number of nodes within the data set before
processing (i.e., before IP alias and anonymous router resolutions); “Anonym”
gives the percentage of anonymous nodes in the original data set. The next
three columns give the classiﬁcation of anonymous nodes as percentage values.
The last two columns presents ﬁnal topology size and percentage of anonymous
routers after processing.
According to the table, the ratio of path traces reaching their ﬁnal destination
decreases in time. In addition, the ratio of anonymous nodes after processing
has a big increase after 2004 (see the last column). The table also shows some
increase in this ratio before processing but not as much. Another observation
from the column “Type 2” is that the ratio of routers employing rate limiting on
active probes has increased in time. These anonymous routers had IP addresses
aliased to anonymous nodes in diﬀerent path traces. On the other hand, “Type 3”
anonymity seem to reduce signiﬁcantly during the last two years increasing the
rate of “Type 1” anonymity. This might be due to recent practices of dropping
incoming packets with private source addresses. We also observed that in some
cases a trace source was behind a NAT and there was a high number of “Type
3” anonymity close to the probing source. Finally, for 2001-2003 data sets after
processing, the “# Nodes” is substantially larger than the other years. Our IP
alias resolution process returned relatively smaller number of alias pairs for these
data sets. The net aﬀect of this outcome is that most IP addresses observed in
the original data set appeared as unique nodes within the ﬁnal data set. This
then resulted in a ﬁnal topology with a large number of nodes.
In the second step, we are interested in the length distribution of path seg-
ments formed by one or more consecutive ‘*’s in path traces. Note that in this
analysis, we do not include Type 3 anonymity in order to observe behavior of
the routers to active probe messages only. We call a path segment in the form of
a (IP1,∗1,∗2, . . . ,∗l, IP2) a *-substring of length l. We are then interested in the
frequency distribution of *-substrings with respect to their length l. Although
a *-substring of length one may have diﬀerent interpretations about the cause
of router anonymity, the occurrences of *-substrings with large length values
may be an indication of ISP policy in preventing active probing in its network.
