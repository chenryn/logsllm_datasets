### Abstract
Active probing has become a prevalent method for collecting information about the topological and functional characteristics of the Internet. Given the increasing need for active probing and the lack of a widely accepted mechanism to minimize the overhead of such probes, the traffic and processing overhead introduced on routers is becoming a significant concern for network operators. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study to understand the responsiveness of routers to active probing from both a historical perspective and current practices. One key finding is that network operators are increasingly configuring their devices not to respond to direct active probes. Additionally, ICMP-based probes elicit the most responses, while UDP-based probes elicit the least.

**Keywords:** Internet measurement, active measurements, router responsiveness

### 1. Introduction
The Internet has evolved into one of the largest man-made systems, significantly impacting many aspects of our daily lives. Due to its substantial growth in size and importance, various groups, organizations, and governments have become interested in understanding different characteristics of the Internet for commercial, social, and technical reasons. Internet measurement studies can be broadly categorized into two types: (1) active measurement and (2) passive measurement. Active measurement studies can further be divided into those that require participation from network devices (i.e., routers) and those that involve only end systems.

Active measurement studies that require router participation typically send measurement probes to routers and expect to receive responses. These probes introduce processing and traffic overhead on the routers. Upon receiving a probe message, a router must create a response packet and send it back to the probe originator. Most routers perform this processing on the slow forwarding path, which introduces significant overhead compared to simple packet forwarding on the fast forwarding path. Additionally, many popular overlay and peer-to-peer network applications use active measurements to optimize their topology and routing performance.

In this paper, we investigate the responsiveness of routers to active network measurements. Our goal is to quantify the responsiveness in two directions: (1) a historical perspective on router participation in supporting active measurements and (2) current best practices employed by network providers in allowing different types of network measurements on their routers. For the historical study, we use router anonymity as observed in traceroute outputs, and for the current practices, we use different types of active probes and observe the responsiveness of routers to them.

### 2. Related Work
Active probing has been increasingly used in various contexts to observe different characteristics of the underlying network. Several research studies utilize active probing to monitor the routing and reachability behavior of the Internet at the inter-domain scale. Many overlay or peer-to-peer network applications also depend on active probing to optimize their performance. The research community has developed several large-scale distributed measurement platforms (e.g., Ark, Dimes, DipZoom, iPlane, PlanetLab, skitter, Rocketfuel) commonly used for various measurement activities, including active probing.

As the volume of active measurement practices has increased, several researchers have pointed out the impact and overhead of active probing in the network and proposed approaches to reduce the volume of redundant active probes. Nakao et al. proposed a routing underlay to unify all measurement activities, where overlay networks query the routing underlay for measurement information. Donnet et al. presented early work on minimizing the active probing overhead in traceroute-based topology discovery, introducing the doubletree mechanism to avoid unnecessary probing of the same set of routers multiple times. A follow-up work by Donnet et al. improved on doubletree with the windowed doubletree approach, which extracts missing links/nodes in discovering a targeted network topology. More recently, Jin et al. considered scalable discovery of the underlying network topology among a group of nodes participating in an overlay network, utilizing a network coordinate system to identify path traces to collect at each overlay node.

In summary, most related work in the area has focused on reducing the unnecessary overhead in active probing-based topology discovery studies. The main goal of this paper is to quantify the responsiveness of routers to active probing-based network measurement practices, providing a historical perspective and demonstrating current practices of network operators to accommodate active network measurements.

### 3. Types of Router Anonymity
In our work, we measure router unresponsiveness (i.e., anonymity) to active probes. Active probes are divided into two types: (1) direct probes and (2) indirect probes. A direct probe is one where the destination IP address in the probe packet is the intended destination, such as in ICMP ping. An indirect probe is one where the destination IP address in the probe packet is some other destination, such as in traceroute when it probes an intermediate router during the trace.

In both direct and indirect probing, eliciting a packet from the probed node indicates the responsiveness of the node. However, not receiving a response to an active probe packet may have different interpretations. In the case of direct probing, the lack of a response message may not necessarily indicate node anonymity, as the probed node may be unreachable, disconnected, or turned off, or either the probe or the response packet may be filtered out at some node in the network. In the case of indirect probing, the lack of a response message generally indicates node anonymity, especially if another responsive node appears later in the same trace output.

We define several types of anonymity for nodes/routers observed in our experiments:

- **Type 1:** A router may be configured to ignore certain probe packets, causing it to be anonymous with such probing. Additionally, a border router may be configured to filter out (i) certain types of packets (e.g., unsolicited UDP packets directed to a local host) or (ii) outgoing ICMP responses originating from nodes within its local domain. Filtering at the border causes internal nodes to be seen as anonymous as well.
- **Type 2:** A router may apply ICMP rate limiting and become anonymous if the rate of incoming probes exceeds the preset limit. Similarly, a router may ignore probe packets when it is congested but may respond to them when it is not congested. In either case, the router has changing responsiveness.
- **Type 3:** A router may have a private (publicly unroutable) IP address. Such IP addresses cannot guarantee node uniqueness, and hence their originators need to be considered as anonymous.

The classification presented in this paper is approximate, as it is difficult to determine the actual cause of a lack of response for an active probe packet.

### 4. Historical Perspective
In this section, we use traceroute-collected historical data sets to study router reaction to indirect probe messages. We downloaded 10 sets of ICMP traceroute path traces from CAIDA’s skitter website, which is the only source we are aware of that provides periodic historical topology data. These data sets were collected within the first collection cycle in January of each year by the skitter system. The website reports that they had several updates to destination IP address lists and a major change in their topology collection system in mid-2004, where they utilized dynamic destination lists with increased probing frequency at skitter monitors.

In the first step, we look for a trend in the ratio of anonymous routers in the collected data set. We do this before and after processing the raw path traces. Our processing includes IP alias resolution and anonymous router resolution tasks. For IP alias resolution, we use an analytical inference approach called AAR. Note that due to the historic nature of the data, a probe-based IP alias resolution approach is not considered. The implication of this limitation is that the resulting topology map may have inaccuracies due to limitations in alias resolution. Especially, data sets in 2001-2003 had fewer aliases, which we attribute to poor alias resolution. For anonymous router resolution, we use a graph-based induction (GBI) approach. Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the results, where “#Srcs” indicates the number of vantage points, “Reached” gives the percentage of traces that reached the final destination, “# Nodes” gives the number of nodes within the data set before processing, and “Anonym” gives the percentage of anonymous nodes in the original data set. The next three columns give the classification of anonymous nodes as percentage values. The last two columns present the final topology size and percentage of anonymous routers after processing.

According to the table, the ratio of path traces reaching their final destination decreases over time. Additionally, the ratio of anonymous nodes after processing has a significant increase after 2004. The table also shows some increase in this ratio before processing, but not as much. Another observation from the column “Type 2” is that the ratio of routers employing rate limiting on active probes has increased over time. These anonymous routers had IP addresses aliased to anonymous nodes in different path traces. On the other hand, “Type 3” anonymity seems to have reduced significantly during the last two years, increasing the rate of “Type 1” anonymity. This might be due to recent practices of dropping incoming packets with private source addresses. We also observed that in some cases, a trace source was behind a NAT, and there was a high number of “Type 3” anonymity close to the probing source. Finally, for 2001-2003 data sets after processing, the “# Nodes” is substantially larger than in other years. Our IP alias resolution process returned relatively smaller numbers of alias pairs for these data sets, resulting in a final topology with a large number of nodes.

In the second step, we analyze the length distribution of path segments formed by one or more consecutive ‘*’s in path traces. We exclude Type 3 anonymity to observe the behavior of routers to active probe messages only. We call a path segment in the form of (IP1, ∗1, ∗2, ..., ∗l, IP2) a *-substring of length l. We are then interested in the frequency distribution of *-substrings with respect to their length l. Although a *-substring of length one may have different interpretations about the cause of router anonymity, the occurrences of *-substrings with large length values may indicate ISP policy in preventing active probing in its network.

### 5. Current Practices
For the analysis of current best practices, we collected a set of IP addresses (over 536,000) from recent skitter and iPlane measurement studies. These IP addresses are known to respond to indirect probes by skitter and iPlane systems. An indirect probe has a different destination than the routers that it elicits responses, whereas a direct probe has a destination IP address of the intended router. In our work, we sent different types of direct probe messages to each of these IP addresses and observed their responsiveness. One key observation is that routers are most responsive to ICMP-based active probes, followed by TCP-based and then UDP-based probes. We also classified the IP addresses based on their top-level domain extensions and observed that routers in different types of organizations (e.g., .net, .com, .edu, .org, and .gov) exhibit similar behavior in response to direct active probes.

### 6. Conclusion
This paper presents an experimental study to understand the responsiveness of routers to active probing from both a historical perspective and current practices. Our findings indicate that network operators are increasingly configuring their devices not to respond to direct active probes. Additionally, ICMP-based probes elicit the most responses, while UDP-based probes elicit the least. These results provide valuable insights into the evolving practices of network operators and the challenges associated with active network measurements.
