### bitsadmin sethelpertokenflags

**Description:**
Sets the usage flags for a helper token that is associated with a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) transfer job. This command is not supported in BITS 3.0 and earlier versions.

**Syntax:**
```
bitsadmin /sethelpertokenflags <job> <flags>
```

**Parameters:**

- **job**: The display name or GUID of the BITS transfer job.
- **flags**: A combination of the following possible helper token values:
  - `0x0001`: Used to open the local file of an upload job, to create or rename the temporary file of a download job, or to create or rename the reply file of an upload-reply job.
  - `0x0002`: Used to open the remote file of a Server Message Block (SMB) upload or download job, or in response to an HTTP server or proxy challenge for implicit NTLM or Kerberos credentials. 

  **Note:** If you use `0x0002`, you must also call the `/setcredentials` command with the appropriate parameters to send the credentials over HTTP. For example:
  ```
  bitsadmin /setcredentials <job> <target_scheme> null null
  ```

**Example:**
To set the helper token flags for a job with the display name "MyJob" to include both `0x0001` and `0x0002`, you would use the following command:
```
bitsadmin /sethelpertokenflags MyJob 0x0003
```

This will enable both the local file operations and the remote file operations with implicit NTLM or Kerberos credentials.
