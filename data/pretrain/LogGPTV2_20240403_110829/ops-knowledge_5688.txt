User: If you have a Google App Engine project you can authenticate based on either a) anyone with a google account or b) a particular google app domain. Since you can connect these two entities I would assume there is some way to query the list of users that can be authenticated. The use case is outputting a roster of all members in an organization to a web page running on Google App Engine. Any thoughts?
Assistant: Yeah, there's no way to get information about people who haven't logged into your application.
