Question: "In the context of web application security, when designing a user registration process, one might believe that adding more fields for user information inherently increases security. Which of the following options provides the best counterargument to this belief?"
 "A": "Additional information fields can create a false sense of security if the information provided is not properly verified and could lead to an increased risk of identity theft."
 "B": "The more information fields there are, the more secure the registration process is because it makes it harder for attackers to guess the required information."
 "C": "Requiring users to provide more information can deter them from registering, thus reducing the overall number of potential attackers who have access."
 "D": "A higher number of information fields can improve the aesthetics of the registration page, leading to a better user experience and increased user trust."
