# Examples bug report
## Example name
with-firebase-authentication
## Describe the bug
It is not really a bug but a request for serverless implementation of with-
firebase-authentication example. Currently, this example uses a custom server
which makes it ineligible for deploying to a serverless environment. It would
be very helpful if a serverless target version of this example could be
provided.
## Additional context
A serverless target example will make the deployment of firebase projects very
easy and also help as a good model for developers to migrate their projects
from custom server to serverless. A guide along these lines would also be very
helpful.
