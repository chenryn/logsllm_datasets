User: Please provide an Ansible-based automated deployment solution for deploying a highly available web server cluster.
Assistant: The following is an Ansible-based automated deployment solution for deploying a highly available web server cluster. 1. Preparation - Install Ansible - Configure host information and configure SSH key authentication between hosts 2. Deploy HAProxy - Install HAProxy software package - Configure HAProxy load balancing strategy - Configure HAProxy status monitoring to ensure high availability 3. Deploy web server - install Nginx and PHP software packages - configure Nginx virtual host information - configure Nginx and PHP runtime environment 4. Deploy database server - install database software packages - configure database related users and permissions - configure master-slave replication Or cluster to ensure high availability 5. Deploy the monitoring system - install monitoring software packages, such as Zabbix, Nagios, etc. - configure the monitoring system, including monitoring items and alarm rules, etc. - integrate the monitoring system with the email or SMS notification system to prompt users to appear Fault 6. Deploy log system - Install log collection and analysis software, such as Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana, etc. - Configure log system, including log collection rules, analysis rules, etc. - Integrate log system and monitoring system to more comprehensively monitor and analyze the system Operation 7. Regular backup and testing - The regular backup system will keep at least three backups for easy recovery - Regularly test the backup to ensure the integrity and recoverability of the backup data In short, the above is an automated deployment solution based on Ansible, using It is used to deploy a cluster of web servers with high availability. Among them, HAProxy plays the role of load balancing, the database server ensures high availability of data, the monitoring system and log system provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis information, and backup and testing are important guarantees to ensure the operation of the entire system.
