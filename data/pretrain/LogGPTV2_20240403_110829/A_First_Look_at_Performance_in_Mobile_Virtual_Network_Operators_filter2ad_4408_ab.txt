Figure 3: Focusing on the key observed factors shows that gen-
erally speaking the MVNOs in family A with higher page load
times have higher RTT and the MVNOs in family B with higher
page load times tend to have high retransmission rates.

 30s) and shows that these TCP idle periods have
non-trivial inﬂuence on the page load times. This is speciﬁcally
true for B1 where the long page load times have about 80% idle
periods.
Further inspection reveals that many (but not all) of these idle pe-
riods are actually due to physical link being dormant, (as revealed
by the DATA_ACTIVITY_DORMANT ﬂag [1]). We suspect that
this is inﬂuenced by the RRC state machine at the radio layer as
deﬁned in the 3GPP standard [24], but we do not have visibility
to actual RRC states using the commodity Nexus 4 phone to ex-
amine this further. Prior work (e.g., [19, 34]) has also shown that
inappropriately tuned RRC states impact web access performance.
Overall, this suggests some potential misconﬁguration or service
differentiation at the radio layer for the MVNO B1 running over
carrier B. In contrast, TCP idle/dormancy issues are negligible for
MVNO family A and are not shown.
We also analyzed signal strengths, handoffs and the pool of cell-
ids that the carriers are associating with and found no signiﬁcant
differences between carriers within the same MVNO family. This
implies that these radio-layer aspects did not play a signiﬁcant role
in the performance difference observed between MVNOs. Some
prior work (e.g., [23, 29]) also noticed little correlation between
signal strengths and performance when analyzing their collected
measurements. This is likely due to the signal strengths usually
falling above a certain threshold.
Our investigation in this section also revealed interesting infor-
mation about the structural differences across the A and B MVNO
families. In MVNO family B, all web trafﬁc goes through an ex-
plicit proxy server that terminates TCP connections while MVNO
family A appears to use a transparent proxy that relays the connec-
tions to the webservers.3
3.2 Video Streaming
Setup: We choose a 3-minute YouTube video available in both
high/low quality and play it in a custom app. We use the Android
YouTube APIs [2] to extract player states (paused, playing, buffer-
ing) to compute the QoE metrics described below. Similar to the
web experiments, we run measurements for both the base carrier
and associated MVNOs, simultaneously, at multiple locations and
at different times of the day.
QoE metrics and Evaluation: The key video QoE metrics are:
(1) video resolution being delivered;4 (2) startup delay or the time
between the user clicking on the play button and the time the video
starts playing; (3) buffering ratio or the percentage of the session
duration spent in buffering state; and (4) load failures, where the
video fails to load. Figure 5 summarizes the distribution of these
metrics.
First, we observe that, with respect to resolution quality, carrier B
and its MVNOs always use the high-resolution version of the video.
On the other hand, carrier A and its MVNOs play a mix of resolu-
tions, except for A3 that always plays the lower resolution video.
Second, in terms of startup delay, MVNO family B overall shows a
higher startup delay than MVNO family A, for the higher-resolution
cases. Also, consistent with the web measurements, we ﬁnd that
in MVNO family B, the base carrier outperforms its MVNOs in
terms of startup delay, and amongst the MVNOs, B2 performs the
poorest with a median startup delay of 23 seconds. Third, we see
that MVNO family A outperforms MVNO family B in terms of
buffering ratio as well, and B2 again performs the worst amongst
the MVNOs in its family. Finally, we ﬁnd a non-trivial number of
video load failures for the MVNOs in the B family; e.g., B1 fails ≈
20% of the time.
Factor Analysis: As before, we use the correlation coefﬁcients to
zoom in on key network-level factors. The startup delay and buffer-
ing states are (unsurprisingly) mostly inﬂuenced by TCP through-
put. Figure 6 shows the difference in the measured TCP through-
put across the carriers and conﬁrms the earlier observations about
video QoE. Surprisingly, MVNO family B chooses the higher qual-
ity video even though it has lower TCP throughputs than MVNO
family A (and hence incurs more buffering). We suspect that this
is related to the explicit proxy described earlier; i.e., the bitrate ne-
gotiation at the beginning of the session is done by the proxy and
does not account for the actual “last hop” throughput achievable by
the client.
To further understand the load failures, we analyzed the packet-
level traces and ﬁnd two reasons behind these failures: (1) the
proxy blocks the video requested by the client by sending an HTTP
3We were able to detect the transparent proxy using Netalyzr which
showed HTTP header modiﬁcations [6].
4The YouTube API does not perform dynamic video resolution
adaption on mobile. It selects a resolution that it considers suit-
able for the current connection at the start and uses it for the entire
session.
