User: I have an HTTP server created by the Tornado framework. I need to update/reload this server without any connection lost and shutdown. 
I have no idea how to do it.
Could you get me any clue?
Assistant: Easy way, do it with nginx.

Start a latest tornado server.
Redirect all new connections to the new tornado server.(Change nginx configure file and reload with nginx -s reload)
Tell the old tornado server shutdown itself if all connections are closed.

Hard way
If you want to change your server on the fly, maybe you could find a way by reading nginx's source code, figure out how nginx -s reload works, but I think you need to do lots of work.
