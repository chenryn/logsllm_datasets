Abstract—Cardinality estimation has become an essential
building block of modern network monitoring systems due to
the increasing concerns of cyberattacks (e.g., Denial-of-Service,
worm, spammer, scanner, etc.). However, the ever-increasing at-
tack scale and the diversity of patterns (i.e., ﬂow size distribution)
will produce a biased estimation of existing solutions if apply a
monotonic hypothesis for network trafﬁc. The most representa-
tive solution is virtual HyperLogLog (vHLL), which extended the
proven HLL, a single element cardinality estimation solution, to
a multi-tenant version using a memory random sharing and noise
elimination approach. In this paper, we show that the assumption
made by vHLL’s does not work for large-scale network trafﬁc
with diverse ﬂow distributions. To resolve the issue, we propose
a novel noise elimination method, called Rank Recovery-based
Spread Estimator (RRSE), which is tolerant to both attack and
normal trafﬁc scenarios while using limited computation and
storage. We show that our recovery function is more reliable than
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we implemented RRSE in
a programmable switch to show the feasibility.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cardinality estimation is a crucial primitive of network
security functions to address various cyberattacks, including
Denial-of-Service (Dos), worm, spammer, scanner, among
others. The main challenge is to estimate a large number of
distinct elements under computation and storage constraints.
As of the second quarter of 2020, Internet users are 4.8 billion,
a 1,239% of growth from 2000 [1]. The massive user base not
only generates a massive amount of data with a high diversity
but also increases the complexity of the used network with
their devices. Moreover, the diverse network patterns (i.e.,
normal and attack trafﬁc) existing in the modern network
require cardinality estimation solutions to be adaptive and
efﬁcient in terms of memory management.
structures,
To address the aforementioned challenges, scalable and
memory-efﬁcient measurement data
such as
sketches were proposed. Unlike a multiplicity estimation that
counts the frequency of an identical element [2]–[9],
the
cardinality estimation sketches count the number of distinct
elements [10]–[25] and are classiﬁed into two types, bitmap-
based [12]–[24] and register-based approaches [10], [11].
The major drawback of most bitmap-based approaches is the
linearly increasing counting capacity, which motivated later
solutions like LogLog [10] and HyperLogLog to scale up

the counting range with adaptive bitmap [26]. Especially,
HyperLogLog (HLL) [11] is widely adopted in practice owing
to its solid estimation theory and scalability.
Driven by the applications’ increasing complexity, demands
for multi-tenant cardinality estimation (i.e., counting the num-
ber of distinct destination IP addresses for every source IP ad-
dress, spreader detection hereafter) are increasing. A straight-
forward solution to the multi-tenant cardinality estimation
problem is to use a dedicated HLL encoder for each spreader,
although that requires too much memory to be practical. For
memory efﬁciency, several sketch-based solutions that enable
multi-tenant counting with a memory sharing strategy were
proposed [9], [11], [16], [18], [19]. Namely, a HLL-based
solution of a virtual HLL (vHLL) [27] has been shown to
be more scalable and accurate than other approaches, such
as PCSA [19], PMC [9], MultiresolusionBitmap, [18], and
Compact Spread Estimator (CSE) [15]. vHLL follows HLL’s
theory to perform each spreader’s cardinality counting and
enables multi-tenant estimations by allowing spreaders to share
a universal memory space randomly. This design will naturally
introduce a noise issue that has to be handled carefully.
Our key observation is that vHLL applies a universal noise
(an identical value) for all different-sized spreaders, which
we found to be inaccurate in an attack trafﬁc scenario (see
section IV-D), where a massive number of medium and high
spreaders exist
in the network trafﬁc (i.e., abnormal ﬂow
distribution). Moreover, vHLL’s cardinality estimation in a
normal trafﬁc scenario can be improved due to the coarse noise
estimation strategy.
In this paper, we design a novel noise elimination algorithm
for HLL-based multi-tenant cardinality counting schemes,
called the Rank Recovery-based Spread Estimator (RRSE).
RRSE uses a global register array for estimating millions
of spreaders and applies a random register sharing tech-
nique that
is commonly adopted in multi-tenant counting
algorithms [2], [3], [15], [16], [27]–[29]. However, unlike
the previous approaches that remove a universal noise (i.e.,
global average) for different-sized ﬂows, RRSE focuses on
the precise noise estimation and elimination for every single
spreader with negligible overhead. More importantly, our new
concept of rank distribution recovery manipulates the recorded
intermediate values (i.e., rank values), which is fundamentally
different from state-of-the-art approaches that eliminate noise
after the intermediate value-based estimation [15], [16], [27],

[28]. To do so, we collect and recover a rank distribution of
the local registers—a register value distribution of a spreader—
by leveraging the distribution of global registers; a universal
random-sharing register array. Then, the recorded/tainted rank
distribution will be recovered at rank level (i.e., ﬁne-grained
recovering). Eventually, our estimator performs cardinality
estimation with the recovered rank distribution without con-
sidering the noise. Our experimental results show that RRSE
can achieve more precise estimation than vHLL and MCSE
with attack and normal trafﬁc scenarios while requiring a
negligible overhead by performing the recovery function using
a dynamic programming technique. We further show that our
RRSE can be embedded in a programmable switch to support
future network systems.
Contributions. In this paper, we make the following contri-
butions:
• We present a rank distribution recovery technique, a new
direction for noise elimination in multi-tenant spread
counting algorithms. Our technique carefully recovers
tainted intermediate data (i.e., recorded rank distribution)
independently for each spreader,
instead of the post-
hoc noise reduction approach adopting a coarse universal
noise for all spreaders.
• We provide an error bound analysis of our algorithm and
prove our rank distribution recovery is unbiased.
• We show comparatively trace-based simulation results
with two real-world datasets of different distributions to
demonstrate the unbiased estimation of our algorithm.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our ap-
proach provides a precise noise reduction for all ranges
of spreaders than state-of-the-art algorithms, regardless of
trafﬁc distributions.
• We designed and implemented a spreader detection
framework in a programmable switch (Toﬁno) to show
its feasibility. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of
resource consumption and latency is conducted.
II. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
In this section, we start with a background description,
namely HyperLogLog [11], which is a cardinality estimation
scheme that has been widely used for spread estimation. Then,
we explore advanced solutions that allow the multi-tenant
spread estimation demanded by modern network monitoring
systems. Next, we discuss the limitations of state-of-the-art
solutions. Lastly, we describe the inspirations behind our
approach. We note that our work focuses on not only achieving
better accuracy but also a tolerant estimation under different
network scenarios (i.e., normal and attack trafﬁc).
Cardinality estimation. HyperLogLog (HLL), as a logarithm-
based cardinality counting algorithm, has been proven to be
accurate and scalable in practice [30]. It uses multiple registers
