The Google Custom Search feature on http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/ currently returns results for both v1.0 and v1.1 documentation. Often, the v1.0 results are ranked higher than the v1.1 results. To address this, we should either:

1. Update the custom search configuration to only index the latest version of the documentation, or
2. Implement multiple custom searches, so that searching from the v1.0 documentation yields v1.0 results, and searching from the v1.1 documentation yields v1.1 results.

This will ensure that users receive the most relevant and up-to-date information based on the version they are viewing.
