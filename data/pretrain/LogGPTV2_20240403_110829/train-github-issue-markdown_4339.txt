The google custom search on http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/ gives results for both
v1.0 and v1.1, and the 1.0 results are often ranked higher than the 1.1
results. We should either update the custom search config to only crawl the
latest version of the docs, or create multiple custom searches so searching
from the 1.0 docs will give 1.0 results.
