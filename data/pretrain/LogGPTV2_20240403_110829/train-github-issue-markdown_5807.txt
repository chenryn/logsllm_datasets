If an async op is not listed in the `OP_DETAILS` map in `40_testing.js`, you
can get the following exception:
    TypeError: undefined is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))
        at asyncOpSanitizer (deno:runtime/js/40_testing.js:177:32)
        at async resourceSanitizer (deno:runtime/js/40_testing.js:369:7)
        at async Object.exitSanitizer [as fn] (deno:runtime/js/40_testing.js:426:9)
        at async runTest (deno:runtime/js/40_testing.js:786:7)
        at async Object.runTests (deno:runtime/js/40_testing.js:984:22)
Presumably some fallback message should show up in these cases, in case a new
op is mistakenly left out, and for ease of development.
Additionally, some async ops related to resources (`op_read`, `op_write`,
`op_shutdown`) and workers (`op_host_recv_ctrl`, `op_host_recv_message`) are
currently missing.
