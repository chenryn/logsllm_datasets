To set up an auto-scaling policy for AWS EC2 instances, follow these steps:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. **Open Auto Scaling Groups**: In the left navigation pane, select "Auto Scaling Groups."
3. **Create a New Auto Scaling Group**:
   - Click on "Create Auto Scaling group."
   - Provide a name for the group and specify the desired, minimum, and maximum instance counts.
4. **Choose a Launch Template or Configuration**:
   - Select an existing launch template or create a new one. This template will define the instance type, AMI, security groups, and other configuration details.
5. **Select VPC and Subnets**:
   - Choose the VPC and specific subnets where your instances will be launched.
6. **Configure Load Balancing (Optional)**:
   - If you are using a load balancer, associate it with the Auto Scaling group to distribute traffic across instances.
7. **Set Up Scaling Policies**:
   - Define scaling policies based on custom metrics or CloudWatch alarms. These policies will trigger the addition or removal of instances based on specified conditions.
8. **Review and Create**:
   - Review all settings and click "Create Auto Scaling group" to finalize the setup.

Once configured, your EC2 instances will automatically scale according to the defined policies. You can also manage and configure auto-scaling groups using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or Software Development Kits (SDKs) for more advanced automation and integration.
