### Anomaly Detection and Mitigation in IC-MANETs

#### Impact of Attacks on Delivery Ratio
When the anomaly detection mechanism is enabled, the Key Delivery Ratio (KDR) drops, but not as significantly as without the mechanism. After a certain period, the KDR stabilizes at values slightly below those observed in the absence of an attack. Figure 7 illustrates the impact of a transient grey hole attack, which, similar to the previous case, drastically decreases the delivery ratio. The detection and mitigation system responds effectively, facilitating a rapid recovery once the attack ceases. However, the detection delay varies among nodes, with nodes near the attackers experiencing delays ranging from 10 to 60 seconds for both continuous and transient attack modes.

It is important to note that mitigating this type of attack is challenging due to its contagious nature. Once the informed vector is sent, the attack can spread to other partitions before mitigation measures are fully activated, especially if the detection threshold is not uniformly strong across all nodes.

#### Evaluation of Anomaly Detection Performance
The results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully resists attacks that conform to the given threat model, despite the complexities introduced by intermittently connected mobile ad hoc networks (IC-MANETs).

#### Locality and Classic Metrics
Traditional metrics for evaluating anomaly detection performance include the Detection Rate (DR) and the False Positive Rate (FPR). In IC-MANETs, these metrics are less meaningful due to the unique characteristics of such networks. To apply these metrics, we need to determine whether a node was under attack during the alarm period. However, in intermittently connected networks, it is not straightforward to define when a node is under attack. Attacks do not always occur within a well-defined time interval or confined space, and nodes may be isolated from or too far from the attackers to be significantly affected.

To address this, we tag packets sent by the attacker and those sent in response to them. A node is considered under attack if it receives at least one tagged packet during an aggregation interval \( I_a \) (as described in Section 4.3).

- **Detection Rate (DR)**: \( \text{DR} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}} \), where TP stands for true positives and FN for false negatives.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: \( \text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FP} + \text{TN}} \), where TN stands for true negatives.

#### Results and Analysis
Figures 8 and 9 show the network-wide average results in terms of DR and FPR, using different values of \( T_2 \). These results are computed by averaging the performance of all 25 anomaly detectors over the entire test interval. The curves indicate that in highly partitioned networks with varying conditions, it is not feasible to analyze the detection mechanism's performance on an aggregate basis using these metrics. While earlier results were promising, these curves show more mediocre overall performance.

We observed that traffic flow, attack type, and the number of attackers in each partition significantly affect detection rates. The network topology in our disaster area consists of eight partitions, with moving nodes acting as "bridges" between them. Node-by-node analysis confirmed that the proximity of adversaries to fair nodes is the most influential parameter for detection performance. Table 1 summarizes the best, worst, and average DR and FPR for continuous draining and grey hole attacks, categorized by the number of adversaries in each partition. Each class (rows in Table 1) represents partitions with similar numbers of adversaries, with about one-third of the fair nodes in each class.

The results, calculated with an alert aggregation threshold \( T_2 \) of 5%, show that partitions with fewer adversaries (zero or one) have lower detection performance. This is because some attacks are still received through sporadic contacts with other partitions.

Additionally, we observed that in transient cases, the false positive rate is slightly lower than in continuous cases. This is because, although attacks are detected with a small delay, the alarm persists even after the attack has ended, leading to a higher FPR in continuous attack scenarios.

In summary, while the proposed approach shows promise, the complex and dynamic nature of IC-MANETs presents significant challenges for traditional anomaly detection metrics. Future work should focus on developing more context-aware and adaptive metrics for evaluating anomaly detection in such environments.
