In [14], Fortz, Rexford, and Thorup showed that OSPF weights de-
rived from one set of cut-points and slopes also tend to give good
performance for other sets of cut-points and slopes. Therefore the
above cost function is a general metric to consider.
For all three metrics, the lower values are preferred.
6. SELFISH SOURCE ROUTING
We ﬁrst investigate the performance of selﬁsh source routing; that
is, all the demands are inﬁnitesimal and the selﬁsh trafﬁc can use any
routes in the physical network. This is the type of selﬁsh routing
scheme analyzed in most theoretical studies. As shown in [30], the
worst-case latency degradation of selﬁsh source routing compared
with optimal routing can be unbounded due to lack of cooperation.
In this section, we seek answer to the following question: how does
selﬁsh routing perform in Internet-like environments?
6.1 Are Internet-like environments among
the worst cases?
Effects of network load: We begin our investigation of selﬁsh
routing by varying network load. Figure 2 shows the latency for
three representative topologies, as we vary the network load scale
factor from 0.2 to 2.
We make the following observations. First, under various loads,
selﬁsh routing yields lower latency than compliant routing, which is
based on optimized-compliant OSPF weights. This result comple-
ments the previous ﬁndings, such as Detour [33] and RON [5], and
shows that the performance beneﬁt of selﬁsh routing over compliant
routing exists even in a single AS network; moreover such beneﬁt
does not disappear even if all trafﬁc is selﬁsh (as opposed to just
having a small portion of selﬁsh trafﬁc in RON). It is not surprising
that compliant routing results in higher latency, because the OSPF
weights are optimized mainly to avoid link overloads rather than
minimize end-to-end user latency. As we will see later, the lower
latency of selﬁsh routing comes at the cost of increased congestion
on certain links.
Second, compared with optimal routing, selﬁsh routing yields
very similar average latency—the difference is close to 0 in most
cases and is always within 30%. In other words, unlike the theoreti-
cal worst cases, the price of anarchy in Internet-like environments is
close to 1. This is likely because under realistic network topologies
and trafﬁc demands, trafﬁc is spread across the network and only a
few links get congested even with selﬁsh routing. As a result, the
average latency under selﬁsh routing is similar to that of optimal
routing.
Effects of network topologies: Next we examine the effects of
network topologies on the latency of selﬁsh routing. Figure 3 com-
pares the latency of different routing schemes when the link latency
function is M/M/1, the load scale factor is 1.0, and the links’ band-
width is OC3.

Figure 3: User latency for all topologies with the M/M/1 latency
function and load scale factor 1. Selﬁsh stands for selﬁsh source
routing; optimal stands for optimal routing; compliant stands
for optimized-compliant OSPF routing. The other ﬁgures in this
section use the same notation.
As Figure 3 shows, network topologies have a pronounced ef-
fect on the relative performance of selﬁsh and compliant routing.
For example, in the Abovenet and power-law topologies, the latency
achieved by selﬁsh routing is less than half of that incurred by com-
pliant routing. A detailed look at these two topologies shows that
these two topologies have mesh-like connectivity; therefore, self-
ish routing is likely to ﬁnd more paths and therefore achieves much
lower latency. However, in all topologies, we observe that selﬁsh
routing consistently yields close to optimal latency.
Effects of latency functions: Finally, we study how different
latency functions affect the latency of selﬁsh routing. From Figure 4,
we observe similar latency across different latency functions. When
comparing the latency achieved by different routing schemes, we
see that the performance of selﬁsh routing is close to that of optimal
routing and noticeably better than that of compliant routing.

6.2 What is the system-wide cost for selﬁsh
source routing?
The previous subsection shows that unlike theoretical worst cases,
selﬁsh source routing in Internet-like environments incurs low la-
tency. A natural question is whether the low latency comes at the
expense of increased system-wide cost. We examine this issue by
comparing different routing schemes based on two metrics: (i) max-

imum link utilization and (ii) network cost, both deﬁned in Sec-
tion 5.4.
Effects of network load: We start by examining the impact of
network load. Figure 5 shows the maximum link utilization for the
same network conﬁgurations as those in Figure 2. From Figure 5,
we observe that in compliant routing, maximum link utilization in-
creases linearly with offered load. This is expected since we use the
same set of weights to scale the trafﬁc (see Section 5.2). In com-
parison, both optimal routing and selﬁsh routing can cause high link
utilization even when the overall offered load is low. For exam-
ple, in both ISP T opo and PowerD10 topologies, at a load factor
of 0.2, the maximum link utilization of optimal routing is close to
90% and that of selﬁsh routing is close to 100%. This result oc-
curs because both optimal routing and selﬁsh routing aim to choose
shortest paths; thus they are more likely to cause congestion there,
whereas compliant routing more uniformly spreads trafﬁc across the
entire network to avoid link overloads at the cost of longer end-to-
end paths. The high network utilization is undesirable, since many
backbone networks are kept at a load well below 50% so that there
are enough backup paths during link or router failures [20].
Effects of network topologies: Next we verify the above obser-
vations by varying the network topologies. As shown in Figure 6,
selﬁsh routing consistently yields the highest maximum link utiliza-
tion and network cost in all topologies. For example, in the Exodus
network, the maximum link utilization achieved by selﬁsh routing
is 40% higher than that of optimal routing and 80% higher than
that of compliant routing; for the same network, the network cost of
selﬁsh routing is over an order of magnitude higher than that of op-
timal routing or compliant routing. These results suggest that selﬁsh
routing may make a network much more vulnerable to overload, es-
pecially when failures occur.
Effects of latency functions: The results based on other latency
functions are qualitatively the same, as shown in Figure 7. Since
both latency and network cost/utilization are not very sensitive to
latency functions for the topologies that we consider, in the follow-
ing sections we focus on the M/M/1 latency function. Moreover, we
show only the maximum link utilization, since it is more intuitive
and it gives consistent results as network cost.
