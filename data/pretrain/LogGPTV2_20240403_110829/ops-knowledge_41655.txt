Assistant: Here's a checklist of best practices for securing your company's network and defending against attacks: 1. Make sure all software and operating systems are up to date and kept updated. 2. Use security software and antivirus software and keep them updated. 3. Establish a strong password policy, remind employees to change passwords regularly, and avoid common passwords that are easy to guess. 4. Use two or more authentication procedures, such as smart cards, fingerprint recognition, or security tokens. 5. Identify access and data permissions and assign them to employees. 6. Restrict employees' network access to only the resources they need. 7. Educate employees on cybersecurity awareness, including how to avoid phishing emails and unnecessary downloads. 8. To prevent internal data leakage, limit employees' permission to copy documents and access corporate data outside corporate equipment. 9. Establish a cybersecurity process and a emergency recovery plan (BPR), and provide training to employees. 10. Share security information with other companies and participate in cooperation against cyber threats. In conclusion, cybersecurity is one of the important factors for companies to maintain their business success, so it is necessary to ensure that they can respond and recover quickly after an attack occurs.
