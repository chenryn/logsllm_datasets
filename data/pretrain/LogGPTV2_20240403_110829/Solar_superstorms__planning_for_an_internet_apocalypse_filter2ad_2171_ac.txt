sists of 470 cables which interconnect 1241 landing points (nodes)
across the globe with latitude/longitude information of the landing
points. Each cable has multiple branches and thus interconnects
several cities. The longest cable has a length of 39, 000 km.

Intertubes dataset. We rely on the Intertubes [29] dataset
with the US long-haul ber endpoints for analysis of land transmis-
sion lines in the US.
4.1.3
ITU dataset. The TIES version of the ITU transmission
map consists of land and submarine communication network infor-
mation. This map is built using data from several sources ranging
from direct information obtained from operators to secondary maps
built by organizations for larger regions or countries. Since sub-
marine cables are considered as a separate dataset, we use only
land cables from ITU in our analysis. Moreover, while the original
dataset contains ber and microwave links, we restrict our analysis
to ber links. The ITU dataset contains both long-haul and short-
haul links. Note that we have not removed the Intertubes dataset
from the ITU dataset to prevent unnecessary network partitioning
in the bigger dataset. The ITU dataset contains 11, 737 network
links from across the globe that interconnect 11, 314 nodes. The

with respect to latitude.
(a) Long-Distance Cable endpoints
While smaller countries have limited exibility regarding the
location of their submarine endpoints due to their tight geograph-
ical boundaries, we observe that there is room for improvement,
particularly in larger nations like the US. While submarine cables
between the US and Asia are more uniformly distributed along the
west coast from Seattle to Southern California, there is a higher
concentration of cables between the North East and the northern
parts of Europe. There is only a single cable connecting Florida
with Portugal and Spain in southern Europe (below 40> #).
We analyze the location distribution of other components in
the Internet ecosystem (data centers, DNS root servers, IXPs) and
observe a similar pattern of higher density at higher latitudes. The
distribution of public data centers and colocation centers are shown
in Figure 2 which follows the same pattern. In Figure 4, we show
that 31% of submarine endpoints, 40% of Intertubes endpoints, 43%
of IXPs, 38% of Internet routers, and 39% of DNS root servers are
located above 40>. Moreover, another 14% of submarine endpoints
have a direct link to these nodes, putting these locations at risk
of GIC induced currents as well. However, only 16% of the world
population is in this region. 1 2
We also evaluate the average cable length in the US long-haul
ber network, the global ITU land ber network, and the global
submarine cable network. The US long-haul ber dataset [29] only
provides approximate node locations and link information. Since
these cables are known to be located adjacent to the US road sys-
tem [29], we estimate the link length as the driving distance between
the endpoints using Google maps API. From the publicly available
1Note that since the Internet user population in developing countries grew rapidly in
the past two decades and the Internet infrastructure deployment has not advanced at
the same pace, observations from past work such as the Internet infrastructure being
located predominantly where the users reside [44] are not valid today.
2While the Internet user distribution is not the same as the population distribution,
these are very similar, and our conclusion regarding the distribution of Internet infras-
tructure in relation to users holds. The dierence in percentage points between the
population of a continent and Internet users in a continent as a fraction of the world
is at most 5.5% [8]. For e.g., Asia has 55% of the world’s population and 52% of the
world’s Internet users (dierence of 3% in Asia, the largest dierence of 5.5% in Africa).
While Internet user statistics based on latitude are not available, using the highest
rate of Internet penetration above 40> and recent data on total Internet users [8], an
upper bound on the percentage of Internet users in this region is 24% of the world
population. In short, the large skew of Internet resources remains true even when we
restrict the comparison to Internet users and not the total population.

submarine dataset [15], we use 441 out of 470 cables for which
length information is available.
In Figure 5, we observe that cable lengths are an order of magni-
tude higher in the submarine network (775 km median, 28000 km
99C⌘ percentile, and 39000 km maximum). A large fraction of land
cables are not vulnerable to GIC since they are shorter than 150
km and hence, do not need repeaters. Due to the relatively large
link lengths and presence of repeaters, submarine cables are more
vulnerable to failures. They are also more dicult to repair [25].
4.3 Infrastructure Resilience
The impact of a solar event extends well beyond the event based
on the extent of damage caused and the time needed for recov-
ery. In this section, we report results on preliminary experiments
characterizing the vulnerability of long-haul networks.
4.3.1 Methodology. We evaluate the resilience of long-distance
cables using a broad range of repeater failure models. In practical de-
ployments, inter-repeater distance range from 50 to 150: and 60> (! > 60, 40  60, 40 < ! < 60, and ! < 40. Assigned failure probability
per repeater in (1 is [1, 0.1, 0.01] and in (2 is [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]
across the three levels respectively.

connectivity to Europe under this failure scenario, but Brazil does
not. This is because the Ellalink cable connecting Brazil to Portugal
is 6, 200 km, while the cable connecting Florida to Portugal is much
longer at 9, 833 km.
Across several countries, there are short cables interconnecting
nearby nodes. For example, cables interconnecting various islands
in Hawaii or that connecting two landing stations in Rhode Island.
Across both high- and low-latitude locations on all continents, such
cables are unaected even under high repeater failure rates.
4.4 Systems Resilience
In the previous section, we analyzed the impact on the physical
infrastructure. The impact on Internet users will, however, depend
on systems that run on this physical infrastructure. In this sec-
tion, we discuss our investigation on Autonomous Systems (ASes),
hyperscale data centers, and DNS servers.
