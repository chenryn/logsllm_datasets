roundings [15]. The other method is to apply line-filters to the
signal and power lines connected with MSoCs. The filters will re-
duce the leaked radiation because leakages are mainly radiated from
the external lines connected to MSoCs. Especially, if there exist the
long physical electrical lines within the product, special blocking
efforts should be focused so that there are no components to play
as a radiative antenna role. Nevertheless, the blocking techniques
may not be good solutions because they have a limited effect.
Avoidance of SWREG. As presented in Figure 9(b), SWREG
substantially increases the unwanted radiations. Therefore, em-
ploying LDO instead of SWREG in MSoC is a better choice from
a security perspective. However, as demonstrated in Table 1, LDO
is not as efficient as SWREG because it causes the fatal shortening
of battery life in battery-powered systems. We recommend that
MSoC manufacturers should not provide the mutually exclusive
regulator option, such as only SWREG or only LDO. According
to the experimental results, a mixed or cascaded structure may
give an alternative way to avoid single SWREG. That is, it is de-
sirable for customers to choose a proper power supply module in
consideration of the trade-off situation between SWREG and LDO.
Reduction of the SWREG Noise. One potential approach is
to reduce the switching noise in SWREG design stage. The rep-
resentative suggestion is the spur-free switching technique. The
basic idea of the technique is to change a switching parameter
over time not to accumulate the single frequency switching effect;
a typical changing parameter is the phases of the switching fre-
quencies [29, 45, 46]. In [29], the authors showed that the periodic
frequency spurs of SWREG could be fully eliminated regardless of
its operating condition or actual switching frequency.
Reduction of Substrate Coupling. Although this approach
is a long-term solution, it is the most effective way. It involves
circumventing this vulnerability by reducing the unintentional EM
emissions in the chip design stage. First, cautious signal design
techniques are required to reduce the coupling source such as the
clock and the SWREG noises [2, 5, 7, 27]. Second, a mixed-signal
circuit design technique (e.g., separation of the analog and digital
grounds, activation of guard-band filtering, or elimination of the
loop path) is needed to solve the noise coupling [2, 7]. Third, a
system in package (SiP) can be a good alternative solution of an
SoC. Even though the SoC size may be increased slightly, it may
considerably reduce the substrate coupling by separating digital,
analog, and power substrates in a package [7, 48].
8 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we demonstrated the new arising TEMPEST threat
based on the SWREG noise that emanates the strong unintentional
audio signals. We verified that the threat is realistic through exper-
iments for various recent commercial devices. The experimental
results showed that intelligible information can be successfully
reconstructed at a practical distance. In addition, we demonstrate
the feasibility of the attack on a digital I2C interface.
From the experimental results, we could see that the demon-
strated threat is more prominent than known threats due to the
following reasons: (a) higher attack availability: a large num-
ber of frequency resources from several MHz to over 1 GHz are
available and (b) lower attack difficulty: recently introduced SDR
platforms can be utilized as a low-cost and high-sensitivity receiver.
The experimental system setup of the study was composed of
readily available commercial devices and antenna. However, na-
tional intelligence agencies around the world may already possess
or be able to possess more sophisticated (i.e., higher sensitivity and
lower noise) receiver systems, which may naturally increase the
attack distance.

Session 4B: Physical Attacks CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA1098A EM WAVE RADIATION AND COUPLING MECHANISMS
A.1 Carrier Coupling [3, 31, 35].
EM emanations from electronic devices can be classified into “direct emission (DE)” and “carrier coupling emission (CCE).” Figure 17 shows the
time signal and the frequency spectrum of DE and CCE, respectively.
DE can be explained by Maxwell’s equations, as an EM wave is caused by the time-varying current flow of a circuit. DE is radiated at
a low-frequency band because the original signal is generated in the baseband; as a result, the detectable distance at a receiver is as far
as several centimeters. However, when a carrier signal with its frequency (𝑓𝑐), such as a clock, is coupled to the baseband signal, CCE is
radiated in the form of amplitude or angle modulation. In addition, the non-ideal and non-linear circuits generate harmonic components at
the 𝑛 × 𝑓𝑐 frequencies, where 𝑛 is an integer; however, the signal power decreases sharply as 𝑛 increases. As shown in Figure 17, the spectral
powers of CCE signals are generally stronger than that of DE, revealing that CCE signals are radiated over a longer distance, and the EM
attackers mostly use CCE channels.
A.2 Carrier Inter-modulation & Coupling [26].
If there are two strong carriers with different frequencies (𝑓𝑐1 and 𝑓𝑐2) where (𝑓𝑐1 > 𝑓𝑐2) in a circuit, the frequency spectrum of the signal
emission appears as shown in Figure 18. The radiated frequency (𝑓𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) can be expressed as:
𝑓𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑛 · 𝑓𝑐1 + 𝑚 · 𝑓𝑐2,
𝑛, 𝑚 = 0,±1,±2, ...
(1)
In cases of large 𝑛 and 𝑚 values, no emission may be observed, because the radiated power decreases under the noise floor. The carrier inter-
modulation and coupling are characterized by a plurality of emission signals over the wide-frequency band, depending on the frequencies of
the two carriers.
