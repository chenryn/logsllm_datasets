I came around this and this seemed related to #9595 but could also be a bug in
the above interacting with the CategoricalIndex. Using the same example as
#15470 with pandas 0.20.3:
#### Code Sample
        s = pd.Series([2, 1, 0], index=pd.CategoricalIndex([2, 1, 0]))
        s[2]  # works (interpreting as label)
        s.loc[2]  # fails with TypeError: cannot do label indexing on  with these indexers [2] of 
        # of course the below works!
        s = pd.Series([2, 1, 0], index=[2, 1, 0])
        s[2]  # works (interpreting as label)
        s.loc[2]  # works (interpreting as label)
#### Problem description
`s.loc[2]` shouldn't fail and should select the label '2'.  
Note this happens also with a pd.DataFrame.
