### Religious Affiliations of Respondents

The religious affiliations of the respondents, as shown in Figure 3, indicate that 74.4% of the elites and 77.4% of the public were Christians. In the total sample, 76.2% identified as Christian, while 23.8% identified as Muslim. This finding is somewhat surprising, given the general belief that there are more Muslims than Christians in Sierra Leone. The study's results may be influenced by the higher concentration of Christians in the capital compared to rural areas.

**Figure 3: Distribution of Respondents by Religious Affiliation (%)**

|   | Elites | Public | Total |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| Christians | 74.4 | 77.4 | 76.2 |
| Muslims | 25.6 | 22.6 | 23.8 |

### Educational Status of Respondents

Table 1 provides a breakdown of the educational status of the respondents. It shows that 84.6% of the elites had university education, while only 46.8% of the public had secondary school education. In the total sample, 43.6% had university education, and 33.7% had secondary education.

### Ethnic Composition of Respondents

Table 2 details the ethnic composition of the respondents. The data reveals that 22.1% were Mende, 14.7% each were Limba and Temne, and 10.5% were Creole. This result is noteworthy because the Temne are the second largest ethnic group in the country after the Mende. The ethnic sample reflects the diversity of Sierra Leone and provides a representative sample of the different ethnic groups.

### Awareness of the TRC

Broad awareness of the existence and activities of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is crucial for its success in promoting national reconciliation. Therefore, it was important to assess the level of awareness among the respondents.
