The religious affiliations of the respondents showed that 74.4% of the elites and 
77.4% of members of the public, were Christians. In the total sample 76.2% were 
Christians while 23.8% were Muslims (Figure 3). This is rather surprising because 
it is generally believed that there are more Muslims in Sierra Leone than Christians. 
The finding of the study may not be unconnected with the fact that there is a high 
concentration of Christians in the capital compared to the rural areas.
The educational status of the respondents shown in Table 1, revealed that 84.6% 
of the elites had university education, whereas only 46.8% of members of the public 
had secondary school education. In the total sample 43.6% had university educa-
tion while 33.7% had secondary education.

Table 2 represents the ethnic composition of the respondents, revealing that 22.1% 
were Mende, 14.7% each were Limba and Temne while 10.5 were Creole. This result 
is also quite revealing because the Temne constitute the second largest ethnic group in 
the country after the Mende. But then the ethnic sample also reflects the diversity of 
the country, and a sufficiently representative sample of the different ethnic groups.

Slightly above half of the respondents 50.5%, were employed and 49.5% were un-
employed, (Figure 4). More revealing is the fact that as many as 38.1% of the re-
spondents were unskilled workers, but 27.8 % were professionals, 15.5% were skilled 
while  11.3%  were  students  (Table  3).  Of  course,  that  they  have,  or  do  not  have 
skills, is not to suggest that most of the respondents are gainfully employed. Al-
though conclusive statistics are not available, it is generally acknowledged that the 
high unemployment rate among the youths, especially in Freetown, in particular 
and Sierra Leone in general, was an important factor in the ability of the RUF to 
easily recruit youths for the civil war.
9.1 awareness of the Trc
Broad awareness of the existence and activities of the TRC is important for its suc-
