Deferring a read-onlytransaction. To avoid situations when a read-only transac-
tioncancauseananomalythatcompromisesdataconsistency,Postgreoffers
an interesting solution: this transaction can be deferred until its execution be-
comes safe. It is the only case when a  statement can be blocked by row
updates.
