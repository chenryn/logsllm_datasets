I have to load the data to the cache, but I find that I didn't find such a
method that I want to find the cache source path by using the url, like this:
`File file = .get(url);`  
Only find that:
    future = Glide.with(mContext).downloadOnly().load(sticker.getPictureUrl()).submit();
    File cacheFile = future.get();
How i do it?
