User: Is there a way to modify the PATH environment variable in a platform independent way using python?
Something similar to os.path.join()?
Assistant: The caveat to be aware of with modifying environment variables in Python, is that there is no equivalent of the "export" shell command.  There is no way of injecting changes into the current process, only child processes.
