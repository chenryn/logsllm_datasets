  * Electron version: 1.7.x
  * Operating system: Windows 10
### Expected behavior
You should be able to share any screen connected on the computer, see the
content of the screen you selected locally, as well as the other participants.
### Actual behavior
Once you select the screen you want to share on a multi-screen computer
running Windows 10, you immediately get a black screen as the local stream
when you select some of the screens. The other participants also get a black
screen as the remote stream.
### How to reproduce
  1. On a Windows 10 computer or VM, with multiple screens connected, start sharing your screen with any Electron-based app. I reproduced the issue with the Symphony client, but also with this one which is fully open source:  
$ git clone https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron/  
$ npm install  
$ npm start
  2. Once you select the screen you want to share, you immediately get a black screen as the local stream. The other participants also get a black screen as the remote stream. The issue appears to affect the screens randomly, sometimes the impacted screens are the screens number 2, 4, 6, sometimes after a reboot, 4, 5, 6, etc...
### Root cause analysis
At the system level, the way Windows 10 enumerates the screens is slightly
different when a virtual video driver is involved.
On Electron, the picker window is managed by the DesktopCapturerSource object:
https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/structures/desktop-
capturer-source.md and the mapping relies on a naming rule
https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/atom_api_desktop_capturer.cc
that fails when a non-conventional video driver is involved.
At Symphony, we experienced the exact same issue with CEF/Paragon. This is how
we fixed the problem of the screen IDs enumeration: symphonyoss/SFE-
DesktopClient-pgx@`85f0d71`#diff-7e750064e4ad7245e99d95316f830119  
This fix also addresses a similar issue we had with one monitor, but with
Citrix XenDesktop installed (https://www.citrix.com/products/xenapp-
xendesktop/), which also alters how Windows enumerates the screens.  
FYI, this is how the WebRTC native code that does enumeration:
