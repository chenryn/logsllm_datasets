#### 1\. Background
Apache ActiveMQ is an open source Message-oriented middleware written in Java.
Eclipse Jetty is a Java HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container which
supports web containers such as JSP and servlet. ActiveMQ 5.0 and its later
versions have Jetty integrated by default. It provides a web application that
monitors ActiveMQ after startup.
On April 14, 2016, foreign security researcher Simon Zuckerbraun exposed
multiple security vulnerabilities in Apache ActiveMQ Fileserver, which could
allow remote attackers to replace web applications with malicious code and
execute remote code on affected systems (CVE-2016-3088) .
#### 2\. Principle Analysis
The FileServer service in ActiveMQ allows users to upload files to a specified
directory via the HTTP PUT method, and download [ActiveMQ 5.7.0
Source](http://archive.apache.org/dist/activemq/apache-activemq/5.7.0/activemq-parent-5.7.0-source-release.zip) . The key code for
background processing PUT is as follows.
Users can upload files to the specified directory. The path is defined in
`conf / jetty.xml`, as follows:
Interestingly, we forged a special upload path that can reveal the absolute
path.
Following the PUT method, you can see that the following function is called.
At the same time, the key code of the background processing MOVE is as
follows. You can see that the method does not restrict or filter the
destination path.
From this, we can construct a PUT request to upload webshell to the fileserver
directory, and then move it to the admin / directory with execute permissions
through the Move method.
#### 3\. Tips to the exploit
Based on the above vulnerability principle, we can think of various ways to
exploit.
(Note: The following results are reproduced in ActiveMQ 5.7.0, and the MOVE
method utilization is very unstable during the reproduction process.)
  * Upload Webshell
First PUT a Jsp Webshell to the fileserver directory
Webshell does not have execute permissions in the fileserver / directory
Burst the absolute path
Then use the MOVE method to move the Webshell into the admin / directory (you
can also use relative paths)
Visit , the command is successfully
executed
  * Upload SSH public key
Since any file can be uploaded and moved, we can use ssh public key to achieve
SSH login.
First generate a key pair. (Not required if it already exists)
Then upload, move to `/ root / .ssh /` and rename it to `authorized_keys`
Then log in.

#### 5\. Vulnerability protection scheme
  1. The function of ActiveMQ Fileserver has been removed in 5.14.0 and later versions. Users are recommended to upgrade to 5.14.0 and later.
2.Disable the ActiveMQ Fileserver function by removing the following
configuration of `conf \ jetty.xml`
