Question: "In the context of signature-based detection systems for computer viruses, what are the potential advantages and disadvantages of this method, considering the ongoing arms race with attackers?"
 "A": "Advantage: The system is effective against zero-day attacks. Disadvantage: Requires constant updates to maintain effectiveness."
 "B": "Advantage: Can quickly identify and isolate known viruses. Disadvantage: Struggles with polymorphic viruses that alter their appearance."
 "C": "Advantage: Does not require updates once set up. Disadvantage: May cause significant system performance degradation."
 "D": "Advantage: Can preemptively block viruses before they infect systems. Disadvantage: Attackers cannot anticipate and adapt to the detection methods."
Answer: B
