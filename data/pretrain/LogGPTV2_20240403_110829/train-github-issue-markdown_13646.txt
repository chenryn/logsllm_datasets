According to the documentation, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can automatically detect tasks from Gulp, Grunt, and Jake files. It would be beneficial to have an extension point that allows for the addition of support for other types of build files. While I have developed a plugin for FAKE (F# Make), a more general solution enabling users to extend the existing functionality, rather than duplicating it, would be preferable.
