According to documentation VS Code can autodetect tasks from within Gulp,
Grunt and Jake files.
It would be nice if there was extension point to add support also for other
type of build files - while I have created FAKE (F# Make) plugin I think it
would be better to have more general solution allowing us just to extend
existing functionality instead of duplicating it.
