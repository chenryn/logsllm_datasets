identification and classification activities need only assign new titles to an existing 
methodology; any new requirement set forth can simply be added to an already 
effective security plan.

4.4.2.1.   Electronic Security Perimeters (ESPs)  
ESPs will be used to segment the network and will be critical in planting security 
controls. All ESPs need to be inherently trusted zones. All access points, whether 
Ethernet, fiber, proprietary or any other physical or wireless connection to an ESP, 
must be identified and protected appropriately. It is extremely important, for an effective 
defense-in-depth approach that ESPs are defined in a layered or hierarchical approach. 
Generally, primary, secondary and tertiary ESPs will suffice.  
The primary ESP should comprehensively encompass the entire site, all ESPs, and 
thus, all trusted zones. All physical and wireless connections must be identified and 
documented. These connections to a primary ESP will be external connections, and 
are by far the most important to protect, obviously; they are, usually, the only access 
points available to a remote attacker. Access points to a primary ESP deserve 
somewhat excessive protection mechanisms, stronger authentication and strong 
encryption mechanisms. 
Connection points between discrete secondary ESPs of a given site will be internal 
access points for various network segments. A secondary ESP should never have any 
site external connections.  All external connections to a secondary ESP should pass 
directly through the primary ESP before communicating to the outside world. 
Connection points between discrete secondary ESPs deserve robust and effective 
controls, as discussed later. 
Often, sites do not protect tertiary ESPs or even define them, this is a mistake. 
Tertiary ESPs are the last line of defense for cyber devices. They deserve the same 
level of controls and protection as secondary ESPs, though somewhat more 
specialized and tailored to each discrete ESP individually. All highest risk critical cyber 
devices should be included in a Tertiary ESP. This layered approach is an effective 
defense in depth approach that facilitates isolation of one ESP from another during 
compromise. 
4.4.2.2.   Protection of ESP Access Points 
Defense-in-depth is a layered security strategy and tactic used to strengthen 
security controls at all levels. Defense-in-depth originated as a military strategy with a 
goal of delaying, rather than preventing the advance of an attacker by yielding space to 
buy sufficient time to respond effectively. An effective defense-in-depth strategy results 
in either an attack attempt of infeasible duration or an attack duration that buys enough 
time to detect and respond to an attack. Various methods and tools are discussed in 
the following section.   Always vary the use of tools and vendors across levels to make 
the network more resistant to compromise.

A. Limiting access to the Primary ESP via the DMZ 
The DMZ limits and controls all communication between trusted zones, which make 
up the area internal to the primary ESP, and un-trusted zones. Any individual device 
that connects to an un-trusted zone needs be included in the DMZ to maintain a true 
DMZ. Any device included in the DMZ would inherently be a level 1 Critical Cyber 
Asset by the previously developed classification and thereby all connections to the 
DMZ will have the highest levels of security. The DMZ is a bit special, and even this is 
too low of a classification; special considerations are required for this zone. Firewalls 
from two different manufacturers must bridge the trusted zone and un-trusted zone 
access points.  This prevents a vulnerability in one firewall from allowing access to the 
entire system.  In an ideal setup, there is only one connection between the DMZ and 
the untrusted zone and one connection between the DMZ and the trusted zone. If only 
unidirectional communication is required or the organization can operate with 
unidirectional communication, install a data diode; they serve their purpose well. Virtual 
Private Networks (VPNs) may prove to be an effective security control within the DMZ. 
Internet access should not be permitted directly through the DMZ, an ESP or a 
trusted zone. Internet access from the primary ESP may be obtained through the DMZ 
then through the business network, but even this is not good practice and should be 
avoided. All communication protocols associated with the Internet Protocol Suite (e.g. 
TCP/IP) should be routed through a stateful firewall.  
B. Limiting access between Secondary ESPs 
Secondary ESPs should only communicate with other secondary ESPs or access 
points to the primary ESP. Electronic access to any secondary ESP through any 
access point should only be permitted through a well managed and stateful firewall. 
Log all access events. Monitor, detect, and alarm all attempts and actual unauthorized 
access events continuously and electronically. Consider recording user activity in some 
manner. Provide session lock for inactive users and an effective method to terminate 
sessions. Protect redundant connections as well as primary connections.  All level 1, 2 
and 3 devices should be housed in a secondary or tertiary ESP. 
C. Limiting access between Devices and/or Tertiary ESPs 
Tertiary ESPs should only be defined for highest risk cyber devices and must be 
tailor to each system. 
D. Domain Controllers, Active Directory and Group Policy Objects (GPOs) 
In-depth discussion of domain controllers, active directory and GPOs are outside the 
scope of this paper, however, they are highly recommended. These controls provide 
ease and cost savings to security and user management and deeper insights into an 
operating system’s security configurations, if they are used properly. NIST Special

Publication 800-81, “Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide” is a 
recommended guide for installing domains at enterprise facilities. As of July 2010, an 
equivalent guide does not exist for generating facilities, but this is a good starting point. 
4.4.2.3.   Protection of cyber devices 
When determining how to protect cyber devices, classifications can play a key role, 
but only if they are design and implemented correctly; over fragmenting policies across 
too many levels of criticality or over applying too few policies across often too few 
devices are common mistakes. The classifications outlined in section  4.4.1 are 
intended for large industrial facilities.  When security controls are applied, apply them in 
a layered approach but try to maintain some continuity at each layer, unless 
excessively strong protection mechanisms are required, such as in the DMZ, where the 
appearance of disorder may be advantageous. 
A. Applying protections to devices 
The protections applied to various components in an industrial control system will 
vary greatly depending on many factors, but the following guidance should be helpful. 
The protections will generally vary by level of risk/criticality, but note that it is often 
more cost effective to apply one set of controls to all classes of devices rather than 
attempting to apply different sets of controls across the same class of devices; a 
balance needs to occur.  The below recommendations for applying controls to devices 
is meant to act as a list of minimum requirements.  Each hardening subject matter 
applied below is discussed in detail in section  4.4.2.3 B. 
PCs/Servers 
Age, Operating System (OS) and function of PCs/Servers throughout a plant 
tends to vary greatly. This needs to be a consideration while applying controls. 
Whenever possible, standardize on one operating system for a given plant. 
• Surface area reduction via baseline hardening - level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – level 1 and 2 devices 
and certain level 3 devices 
• Configuration and security settings – level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Protection software – level 1 and 2 as well as level 3 devices where yes was 
answered to Q5 (ease of attack). 
• Communications and Data hardening –level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – all device levels 
• Physical security hardening – levels 1, 2 and 3 devices

Network switches  
This refers mainly to managed switches here. Unmanaged switches, hubs and 
routers have limited security capabilities and should be avoided. 
• Surface area reduction  via baseline hardening - level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – level 1 and 2 and 
some level 3 devices 
• Configuration and security settings – level 1, 2 and certain 3 devices 
• Protection software – level 1 and 2 
• Communications and Data hardening –level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – all device levels 
• Physical security hardening – levels 1, 2 and 3 devices 
Printers 
Modern printers tend to come with operating systems, storage and Ethernet 
capabilities. They can be just as vulnerable as PCs, security controls may be 
limited. 
• Surface area reduction via baseline hardening - whenever feasible 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – whenever feasible 
• Configuration and security settings – all device levels 
• Protection software – Not directly applicable 
• Communications and Data hardening –level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – whenever feasible  
• Physical security hardening – whenever feasible on level 1 and 2 devices 
PLCs 
Many modern and all obsolete PLCs were not designed with security in mind.  As 
a result, inherent controls are currently limited and a dedicated add-on security 
device such as the Tofino Security Appliance is usually required. Whether or not a 
similar appliance is the housing device, the following controls should be applied. 
• Surface area reduction via baseline hardening – level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – level 1 and 2 devices 
• Configuration and security settings – all device levels 
• Protection software – Usually not directly applicable, but implement when 
feasible. 
• Communications and Data hardening –level 1 & 2 devices 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – all device levels 
• Physical security hardening –  all device levels

DCSs 
Until recently, DCSs have not accounted for much in the way of security. Modern 
DCS manufacturers claim to have built in “compliance” toolsets, which probably will 
be of some use when protecting these devices.  Applying security controls to a DCS 
may be difficult depending on the age of the device, and third party hardware may 
be required. 
• Surface area reduction via baseline hardening – level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – level 1, 2 and 3 
devices 
• Protection software – level 1 and 2 devices when feasible (third party devices 
will be required on older systems) 
• Communications and Data hardening –level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – all device levels 
• Physical security hardening –  all device levels 
Recorders, Relays and similar Ethernet devices 
Security, both physical and electronic, is limited for this class of devices, though 
controls are still often mandated by governances. If it is infeasible to implement the 
following controls, try using third party tools or, if possible, disabling the Ethernet 
capabilities of these devices until a solution is marketed. 
• Surface area reduction via baseline hardening – port closing only when 
feasible across levels 1, 2 and 3. 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – port closing only when 
feasible across level 1, 2 and 3 devices. 
• Protection software – level 1 and 2 devices when feasible using third party 
hardware 
• Communications and Data hardening –level 1, 2 and 3 devices 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – all device levels when feasible 
• Physical security hardening –  all device levels when feasible 
Devices used for access control and/or monitoring of ESPs & PSPs 
Deserve strong protection mechanisms; if an attack can gain control over a 
device of this class, the attacker can usually gain control over all communications 
running through the device. A device of this class will never be a level 4 device due 
to the content of Q4 (likeliness of attack). 
• Surface area reduction via baseline hardening – all device levels 
• Surface area reduction via device specific hardening – all device levels 
• Protection software – all device levels

• Communications and Data hardening – all device levels 
• Maintenance and hardware hardening – all device levels 
• Physical security hardening –  all device levels 
At this point it should be obvious that it is often more cost effective to apply one 
set of controls to all classes of devices rather than attempting to apply different sets 
of controls across the same class of devices. This may not always be feasible 
though, because different systems may have been installed at different times and by 
different people throughout the 50 year life of the plant.  A database that 
automatically assigns necessary controls based on criticality (which is based on 
user inputs to a discrete set of questions) is highly recommended for applying 
differing security controls across all devices and across individual classes of 
devices. 
B. Hardening 
The goal of hardening efforts on cyber machines is to ensure that only those 
ports, programs, and services required for normal and emergency operations are 
enabled, to ensure the security policies are met and to add or strengthen security 
mechanisms (e.g. virus protection) to result in a more secure system than initial 
examination revealed. This section is written from the standpoint of hardening 
mainly computers, but a number of the requirements herein may be applied to other 
devices as appropriate. 
A full hardening process should only be required on a single cyber device once, 
so long as no major changes have occurred.  If a major change has occurred, such 
as changing the purpose of the device, a full hardening process is required. Security 
policies should be sufficient to maintain an unchanged device’s hardened status. 
It is extremely critical that hardening be done using a systematic and software 
assisted technique. Generally, the first major step of any technique used should 
involve the development, implementation and testing of baseline hardening policies 
via objects in an active directory, security or administrative templates, or third party 
tools such an enterprise configuration manager. The second major step of any 
technique used should be to harden each specific cyber device against developed 
and tested device specific hardening policies. 
Extreme care must be taken during hardening efforts. Significant adverse effects 
can occur when a device is incorrectly hardened. Loss of functionally requiring a full 
system restoration is one possible result. All baseline or device specific hardening 
activities should not result in any unforeseen or unplanned changes. Hardening 
should not affect normal or emergency functionality in any way; for example, 
operator screens, logic and alarms should not be affected by hardening efforts.

Presented at DEFCON 18, July 29th through August 1st 2010, Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas NV 
A prerequisite of hardening is that configuration data about the devices being 
hardened must be obtained before hardening the device.  Attempting to harden 
cyber assets without complete and accurate information can result in dangerous, if 
not catastrophic, situations, especially when trying to harden devices associated 
with a running unit which should be avoided if possible. Software that makes use of 
databases and configuration and vulnerability scanners to provide a partly 
automated solution can be of significant assistance in managing configuration data. 
Security, Configuration and Asset Management 
There are only two effective tools that past experience has identified for 
managing security and configuration data in an automated fashion.  The first is 
Microsoft’s Management Console (MMC) operating in an active directory and 
domain environment.  This is the most common tool used, particularly in the IT 
realm. The second is Enterprise Configuration Manager (ECM), which also requires 
a domain.  ECM provides additional tools and graphics above and beyond MMC.  
Asset management is inherently ingrained in the software, though particular 
attention needs to be paid to disposal or redeployment of unused hardware (which 
is not covered in the software).  Antiquated, obsolete or non-vendor supported 
devices should be replaced as soon as possible. Patch management and virus 
signature file updates should be built into the software, no need for another tool if it 
can be avoided. Ideally, the system should be able to perform assessments of 
security vulnerabilities, audits against governing or custom standards and remotely 
initiated maintenance activities. Each organization will have to determine the best 
configuration management solution for themselves, hopefully with a formal software 
validation, verification and analysis program. Refer to NIST Special Publication 800-
40, “Creating a Patch and Vulnerability Management Program” for additional 
guidance on creating an effective patch management program to ensure all devices 
are patched to an adequate level. 
Whatever managing software an organization selects, there are established best 
practices to follow that will save time and money. All records of device 
configurations must be kept indefinitely on electronic media, stored by date, 
managed and well protected to provide evidence for auditors. New cyber devices 
must be hardened before they hit the network or are scanned for configuration data. 
Every change must be tested in lab, then implemented, then tested in the field.  
Changes can be grouped for a device or multiple devices, if the infrastructure is in 
place, to expedite this process. Tests must ensure no loss of normal or emergency 
functionality will or has occurred.  Rollbacks may be required and backups should 
be performed prior to implementation and after testing. Devices should also be 
rescanned for configuration data directly after successful field testing. 
Lastly, there are some tools designed specifically for auditing a computer. Some 
only have local capabilities; others can be run remotely, often in scheduled runs. 
Some gather highly useful raw configuration data and others simply output a list of

vulnerabilities. Manually gathering data locally is not recommended, though, 
Winaudit works well if it is necessary. Additional or similar tools that work well 
include Nmap, Zenmap, Nessus, HP Discovery, and a number of others. Well 
planned and thought out network scans performed during an outage are the 
preferred method of obtaining the data; though systems can be programmed to 
slowly and non-invasively gather data during operation. Also note that the level of 
data gathered is directly related to the level of privileges of the user’s account, 
logging in with higher account privileges before a scan will generally produce more
