### What problem does this feature solve?
I am trying to integrate Vue with Meteor Blaze and am working on rendering of
Vue components from Blaze templates. I would like to programmatically create
an Vue instance (`new Vue(...)`) and pass it props and args which would be
equivalent to doing ``. So an
object of key/values which would then be mapped to props, if keys are among
props, or be set as element attributes otherwise. But the important part is to
also be able to update all of them afterwards. So if any of the props or args
change, allowing to call a function to update them would be great.
### What does the proposed API look like?
I propose that `propData` could be a function. So that I could provide a
reactive function which would be used to populate both props and args (so any
keys returned from the function which are not props would become args).
Alternatively. we could have `vm.$propsUpdate` function which I could run to
update props and args in a more imperative way.
