I encountered an issue with the production build, where Next.js's Babel configuration failed to properly compile my source code. This resulted in an "unexpected token punc()" error, which suggests that the code was not being transpiled to ES5, a requirement for UglifyJS.

To resolve this, I attempted to extend the Babel configuration using `babel-preset-env` (with `targets.uglifyjs = true`) and also tried the `es-2015` presets, but neither approach worked.

Ultimately, I resolved the problem by extending the Webpack configuration to include the `BabiliPlugin` and removing UglifyJS. I believe UglifyJS should be deprecated if it does not support modern JavaScript syntax, as I need to be able to specify the browsers I support.

Additionally, I am having difficulty pinpointing the exact cause of the issue within my source code. 

I apologize if this issue has already been discussed. I have searched through the issues in this repository and believe this is not a duplicate.
