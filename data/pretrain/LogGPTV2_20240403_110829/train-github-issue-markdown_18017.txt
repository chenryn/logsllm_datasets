I have faced the issue with production build. I don't know why, but Next's
babel config didn't properly compile my source code, so I ended up with
"unexpected token punc()" which is most likely not compiled source to ES5
(which is needed for UglifyJS).
I have been searching for issues and also tried to extend babel config with
babel-preset-env (targets.uglifyjs = true), but actually it didn't work, nor
es-2015 presets.
I have fixed this issue by extending webpack config with `BabiliPlugin` and
removing UglifyJS. This is first issue I wanted to report... Moreover I think
uglify should be removed if it doesn't support new JS syntax. I want to be
able to specify what browsers I support.
I have also a problem to detect where and what caused the problem in my
source.
Sorry if this issue has been already discussed.
