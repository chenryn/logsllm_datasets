# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18362.207
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): Daily build from 7/4/2019
    Any other software?
# Steps to reproduce
Just run WindowsTerminal and make sure it is the active window. I also have
the dark theme configured on my system with a Blue accent color.
# Expected behavior
The window title bar area not covered by tabs should reflect my configured
accent color - Blue like this:

BTW the above is from the store version of WT so something has changed for the
worse.
# Actual behavior
The window title bar area not covered by tabs is black:

Also, not a fan on the rounded corners. Every other Window on my system uses
my accent color (and **not** rounded corners) e.g.:

You get the idea.
