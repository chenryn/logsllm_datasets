I got an unexpected exceptions "Explosion" when switching my android virtual
device from 4.7 WXGA to Nexus 6 (nothing fancy, just default configs). The
screen causing the crash had a Gridview widget with `gridDelegate
SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`, built with the `.builder()`
constructor, since I am building a calendar with markers inside and it comes
more handy to have a function creating the children.
From what I understood from the Exception Stacktrace it looks like a numeric
issue when computing the children sizes: 440.8163265306122 is very, very, very
close to 440.81632653061223, but yet bigger.

the code experiencing the bug looks like::
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return new Scaffold(
          body: new Scrollbar(
            child: new ListView(
              controller: _scrollController,
              shrinkWrap: true,
              children: [
                 ***
                new GridView.builder(
                  shrinkWrap: true,
                  controller: _scrollController,
                  itemCount: countDays(firstDay),
                  gridDelegate: new SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
                    crossAxisCount: 7,
                    childAspectRatio: 4 / 5,
                  ),
                  itemBuilder: calendarTileBuilder,
                ),
While changing childAspectRatio to 4.1/5 does not reproduce the bug.
