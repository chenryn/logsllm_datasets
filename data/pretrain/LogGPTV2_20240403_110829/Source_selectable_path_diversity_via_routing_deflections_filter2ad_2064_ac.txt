Figure 5: The number of deﬂection neighbors a router has per incoming interface per destination. Rule 2 and 3 produce more deﬂection neighbors
than Rule 1. (Note that the lines for these rules overlap in the left graph.) Larger networks produce more deﬂection neighbors in which the majority
of routers have a choice of neighbor and some routers have a large number of deﬂection choices.
passed by deﬂections. This looks at how diverse the different de-
ﬂection paths are in terms of their component links and nodes.
To measure the ability to route around faults, we consider in-
dividual links and nodes instead of source-destination pairs. We
compute the fraction of shortest paths that can be re-routed to by-
pass a faulty link or node. We then consider how many of these
paths will be found when the source uses simple strategies to set
tag values.
To measure the ability to switch peering points, we pick sets of
nodes to represent egress points, and compute how often a source
can arrive at an egress that is not its lowest-cost exit. In this setting,
the lowest-cost path is the shortest path to any egress point.
For each metric, larger is better. Some of the results also differ
across runs since they depend on the pseudo-random ordering of the
deﬂection neighbors. When this is the case, we present the average
of 10 runs. We omit the deviation across runs unless otherwise
noted because it is generally too small to be visible.
The sections below describe our results. We summarize the av-
erage metrics for all topologies in Table 1 and present the distri-
bution of the metrics for Abilene, Exodus and Sprint. These three
networks have 11, 79 and 315 nodes, respectively. They provide a
sample of the results that allow us to see how deﬂections change
with the scale of the network. We also ﬁnd that the results for ran-
domly generated networks are consistent with those for designed
ISP networks. This suggests that deﬂections are reasonably robust
to variations in topology.
6.2 Deﬂection Paths
The ﬁrst metric we consider is the number of neighbors in the
deﬂection set, K. This number is the function of the router, the de-
ﬂection rule, the destination, and the incoming interface of a packet.
We compute the value K for all legitimate combinations of router
interfaces and destinations.
(Rule 1 and Rule 3 do not allow all
combinations, since they will not use certain incoming interfaces
for a given destination.) Average results for all topologies are sum-
marized in the Deﬂection Nbr column of Table 1. Figure 5 shows
the cumulative distribution of K for Abilene, Exodus, and Sprint.
We make several observations. First, Rule 2 and Rule 3 are more
ﬂexible than Rule 1. They produce more deﬂection choices in all
simulated networks, usually by a substantial margin. Second, the
larger networks provide more opportunities to deﬂect, as measured
by the size of the deﬂection set. Third, a large fraction of the routers
can deﬂect off the shortest path with Rules 2 and Rule 3. More than
40% of routers have K > 1 in all simulated topologies, and the
fraction is considerably higher for larger networks.
Next, we measure the number of different deﬂection paths a
packet can take between any two nodes in a network. Roughly,
this shows how tags convert deﬂection opportunities at individual
routers into complete deﬂection paths. This measure also depends
on how a router maps a tag into a deﬂection neighbor and tends
to be larger for longer default paths. Again, average results for all
topologies are summarized in the Deﬂection Path column of Ta-
ble 1 and distributions are given for Abilene, Exodus and Sprint in
Figure 6.
As before, we see that Rule 2 and Rule 3 outperform Rule 1
by a wide margin. In this case they have more deﬂection paths.
Even for a small network such as Abilene, more than 80% of node
pairs have a deﬂection path that differs from the default shortest
path with Rule 2 or Rule 3. For larger networks, nearly all node
pairs have a deﬂection path. Moreover, in the case of Sprint we
see that many node pairs have close to the maximum number of
deﬂection paths, which is 210 − 1 for our ten bit tag. This suggests
that our tag mapping rule does a good job of mapping different
tags to different routes. We also simulated a different tag mapping
rule that does not use a pseudo-random modulo operation (Sec-
tion 4.4). The number of deﬂection paths (averaged over all rules
and all topologies) is nearly four times less than that produced by
our tag mapping rule. We also compared our deﬂection rules with
equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing. The average number of al-
ternative paths produced by ECMP on our input topologies ranges
from 0 to 1.4, much smaller than that produced by our deﬂection
rules (Table 1).
Finally, we measure how much the deﬂection paths differ from
the default shortest path. The more they differ, the more likely it is
that a source can bypass faulty nodes or links that lie on the default
routing path. We compute differences as the largest fraction of the
shortest path nodes and links, respectively, that can be bypassed
with a single deﬂection. Suppose Ps = (A, N1, N2, ..., Nn, B)
is the default shortest path routing between node A and B, Pd =
(A, M1, M2, ..., Mm, B) is a deﬂection path between A and B. If
Ni does not appear in Pd, then we count it as a node difference. If
there are a total of x node differences, the fraction of node differ-
ences is computed as x/n. For each node pair, we record the maxi-
mum node difference among all deﬂection paths. This corresponds
to the largest portion of the path that can be avoided. Similarly, we
also computed link difference. We omit results for link differences
to save space, since node differences provide the stricter test: a one
node difference requires at least two link differences.
We present summary results for each topology in the Node Dif-
ference column of Table 1 and distributions of node difference for
