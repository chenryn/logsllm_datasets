User: In the Linux system, how to realize the compression and decompression of files or directories?
Assistant: Common commands for compressing files or directories are "tar" and "gzip". The following are the specific operation steps: 1. Compress files or directories: tar -zcvf filename.tar.gz directory/filename Among them, "-z" means to use gzip to compress, "-c" means to create a compressed file, "- v" means to display the compression progress, and finally the directory or file name to be compressed. 2. Decompress a file or directory: tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz Among them, "-x" means to decompress, "-v" means to display the decompression progress, and the last is the name of the file to be decompressed. If you just use tar for compression and do not use gzip for compression, the command can be changed to: tar -cvf filename.tar The directory/file name decompression command is: tar -xvf filename.tar The compressed file has not been compressed by gzip, so the file The volume is not compressed to a minimum. But decompression will be faster.
