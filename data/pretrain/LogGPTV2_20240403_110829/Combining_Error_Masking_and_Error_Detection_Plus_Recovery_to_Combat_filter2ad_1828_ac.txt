of 1000 years. This MTBF of 1000 years is accept-
able to most commodity systems [17]. Now, the energy
consumed by the delay chain is only 50% of the origi-
nal conﬁguration. However, the soft error requirements
are still met. Alternatively, the delay chain can also be
shut off when it has been detected that the power con-
sumed by the chip exceeds the heat dissipation capa-
bility of the chip package. Thus, the soft error protec-
tion can be tailored according to power requirements
of the application.
3. Exploiting circuit timing dependence on in-
put vector
The SER reduction obtained from the error masking
technique can be improved further if the value of Smax in
eqn. 2 can be increased. This increases the width of the tran-
sient pulse and hence the particle charge required to cause
an error. To increase Smax, the sampling time t1 can be
shifted earlier than the worst case arrival time in a path.
This means that the probability of a correct output being
available at the sampled PO gate at time t1 (P(t1)), is less
than one. The sampling time t2, and t3 should be positioned
such that the probability of sampling a correct value in D2
and D3, P(t2) and P(t3), respectively, are one. The SER of a
gate with sensitized path to a ﬂip-ﬂop where t1 ≤ tpd,worst
is:
SERnew = P (t1) × (SER(w ≥ Snew/2) +
(1 − P (t1)) × SER(w ≥ tlw)
(7)
where SER(w ≥ Snew/2) gives the SER when the
transient pulse width required to cause an error is greater
than half of new slack obtained by shifting t1 and t2, and
SER(w ≥ tlw) gives the SER of the original latch with tlw
representing the latching window of the original latch. The
above equation represents the fact that when the ﬁrst sam-
ple D1 is wrong, SER of the circuit with error masking is
same as original circuit.
In order to reduce SER, compared to the case when error
masking was not applied:
SERnew  Qmin, then SER(w ≥ Snew/2)

We use SPICE simulation to ﬁnd the worst case width
of the transient pulse that reaches the PO for different
charges and for different logic gates. This is done by con-
necting the output capacitance extracted from the synthe-
sized netlist and a piecewise-linear current source approxi-
mating eqn. 10 to the output of a gate whose QCRIT is to be
measured. A path consisting of inverters with varying lev-
els was connected between the gate and the PO, such that
the best case width of the transient pulse reaches the PO.
A path with only inverters provides least pulse shrinking or
electrical masking and hence the transient pulse width that
