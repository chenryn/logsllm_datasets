https://discourse.julialang.org/t/suggestion-julia-version-header-in-jl-
files/16316
strongly suggest a header in .jl files that indicates the version under which
the file is running. issue a warning if this is not the first line in the .jl
file. I would suggest
    #!julia 1.0.0 1.0.1
where the first version on which this .jl was tested on is 1.0.0 and the last
version is 1.0.1.
In the distant future, such a requirement will help you by making it easier
for you to deprecate and break features without incurring the wrath of every
user who has ever written a julia program. I understand that packages have
some REQUIRE aspects already, but this is different. the shebang line should
be in every .jl file, user or packaged.
a secondary minor advantage is easier recognition for unix `file`.
