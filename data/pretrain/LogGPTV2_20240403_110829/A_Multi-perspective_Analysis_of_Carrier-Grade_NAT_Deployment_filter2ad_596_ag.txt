### UDP Mapping Timeouts of CPEs and CGNs

**Figure 12: UDP Mapping Timeouts of CPEs and CGNs**

- **CPE Devices (Right Boxplot):** The boxplot shows the timeout values for all recorded sessions. In NAT444 scenarios (non-cellular CGN), we report the timeout of CGNs rather than CPE NATs. To determine CGN mapping timeouts, we consider only sessions detected as CGN (ยง 4) and where our TTL-driven NAT enumeration identified the NAT at a distance of three or more hops from the client.
- **Observations:**
  - 74% of detected NATs expire idle UDP state after 1 minute or less.
  - Timeout values range from 10 seconds to 200 seconds.
  - Cellular CGNs exhibit a larger median mapping timeout (65 seconds) compared to non-cellular networks (35 seconds).
  - CPE NATs predominantly have a timeout of 65 seconds.
  - Non-cellular CGNs show higher variability and a lower median of timeout values compared to CPE NATs.
  - Low CGN timeout values can negatively affect the longevity of sparse UDP flows also exposed to CPE NATs.
  - While CGNs generally have lower timeout values than CPEs, this may not hold true for all CGNs, as our test cannot detect timeout values greater than 200 seconds.

### NAT Mapping Types

**Figure 13: STUN Results per AS**

- **CPE Routers (Figure 13a):** Shows the NAT mapping type observed for CPE routers.
- **CGN-positive ASes (Figure 13b):** Indicates the most permissive type of NAT mapping for our CGN-positive ASes.
- **STUN Behavior:** When multiple NAT devices are present, STUN reports the most restrictive behavior, which determines eventual NAT traversal. The most permissive STUN type provides a good approximation of CGN behavior.
- **Observations:**
  - Less than 2% of CPE NATs show very restrictive symmetric NATs.
  - 11% of non-cellular CGN ASes have a most permissive mapping type of symmetric NAT, including many popular large European ISPs.
  - Cellular networks show a bimodal distribution with a large fraction of both restrictive (40% symmetric) and permissive (20% full cone) NAT types.
  - Major cellular networks in the US deploy CGNs with symmetric mapping types.

### Implications

- **Widespread Deployment:** ISPs widely deploy CGN, with over 17% of eyeball ASes and over 90% of cellular ASes relying on CGNs. High deployment rates are seen in Asia and Europe due to IPv4 address scarcity.
- **IPv4 Address Space:** Adopting CGN extends the lifetime of IPv4 and fuels the demand for IPv4 address space, affecting market prices and potentially hindering IPv6 adoption.
- **Subscriber Impact:**
  - Limits available ephemeral port space.
  - Restricts the directionality of connections.
  - Limits connection lifetimes due to finite state-keeping budgets.
- **Configuration Variability:** A wide spectrum of configurations and degrees of address sharing is observed, with some ISPs allocating as little as 512 ephemeral ports per subscriber and multiplexing up to 128 subscribers per public IP address.
- **Restrictive Flow Mapping:** CGNs often use more restrictive flow mapping types compared to home CPE hardware, complicating modern protocols like WebRTC.
- **Lack of Guidelines:** The lack of guidelines and regulations for CGN deployment compounds the situation. While the IETF publishes best practices, dimensioning NATs at carrier-scale remains challenging.
- **Regulatory Considerations:** Our findings should interest regulators who impose service requirements on Internet performance. The presence and service levels of CGNs should be identifiable in ISPs' offerings, but most ISPs do not cover CGN deployment in their terms of service.
- **IP Address Reputation:** The meaningfulness of IP address reputation, address-based blacklisting, IP-to-user attribution, and geolocating end-users is eroded in the presence of CGN.

### Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and characteristics of CGN deployment in today's Internet. Our methods, based on harvesting the BitTorrent DHT and extensions to our Netalyzr active measurement framework, effectively uncover CGN deployments. We hope this study will stimulate discussions about best practices, guidelines, and regulation of CGN deployment.
