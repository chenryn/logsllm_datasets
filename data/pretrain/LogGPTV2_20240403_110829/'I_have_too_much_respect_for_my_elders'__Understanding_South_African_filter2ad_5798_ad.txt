a second or sometimes third Facebook account using differ-
ent surnames, such as their mothers to limit who could see
their content. One participant P24 talked about how she was
on their third Facebook account because the ﬁrst two had ‘a
lot of people I don’t want’ that they didn’t want to see their
content anymore. Participants had different stances on the
privacy settings of the two most frequently used social media
applications: Facebook and WhatsApp. Our participants who
knew about the many types of privacy settings that Facebook
offers, such as making one’s account private, tended to ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to use them, even though they use those features
on other social media sites. In multiple cases, when the in-
terviewer demonstrated to the participant how to navigate to
the privacy settings in the mobile application, the participant
was surprised that such a page existed. It appeared that partici-
pants either did not spend the time required to ﬁnd the privacy
settings, or did not have the extra data to spend on navigating
the nested pages on the application to ﬁnd privacy settings. A
few exceptions existed such as:
P13: Well Facebook, I mean that depends on what
your security settings is, and obviously each post, it
can share to a certain audience. In WhatsApp, you
can even set it there to [control] who can see your
proﬁle pic. So it’s all about settings. A lot of people
don’t know about these settings.
More participants appeared to know how to conﬁgure their
privacy settings on WhatsApp, such as being able to specify
who can view a speciﬁc status message or chat, than did for
other social media apps. Notably, participants did not mention
limiting who could see WhatsApp’s “Last Seen” feature.
P41: Okay, WhatsApp you can hide as much as you
can hide on the others, but you can hide who sees
your stuff like your status, your personal life status,
your proﬁle picture. All of that! You can manage
who sees all of that.
What became clear from the interviews is that many partic-
ipants simply leave their privacy settings on the default, not
knowing that they can even be changed. However, once users
were told by their peers about varying levels of privacy con-
trol, they tried to change their settings to adjust their privacy
accordingly, with data sometimes being the limiting factor.
Participants who did know about such settings, found Face-
book privacy settings more difﬁcult to use than WhatsApp.
4.2.2 Blocking Used Instead Of Other Privacy Settings
Participants who were concerned with their privacy most fre-
quently resorted to blocking people instead of using other
privacy settings within the applications. In Saudi Arabia,
WhatsApp users similarly used blocking to avoid unwanted
contact from known and unknown contacts [51]. At least 17
participants talked about seeing inappropriate content or re-
ceiving harassing messages from people they did not know.
Many participants mentioned that they received messages
from strangers asking for meetings or for them to share nude
photos or in some cases, pictures of genitalia from strangers.
For instance, one participant mentioned getting messages
from prisoners, another talked about getting messages from
males that she did not know. These participants lamented not
wanting this undesired contact from strangers but many did
not know how to limit their settings to friends only.
P14: Like in your inbox, other people add you on
Facebook and inbox that they love you. They don’t
know you, they just saw you on Facebook and they
calling you beautiful, trying to meet and call you.
Such things irritate me. Other people send you pic-
tures of their private parts or ask you to send pic-
tures of yours, see things like that.
Most participants in our study more commonly reported
using the blocking feature to block certain people from seeing
posts, with this over-reliance stemming from their lack of
knowledge of all available privacy settings. When asked if
they knew of any other privacy settings, for example, P6 stated
that blocking was the ‘only thing she could think of’ to prevent
others from seeing their content. For example, one participant
explicitly stated that the reason he preferred WhatsApp to
Facebook is because it is not possible to block people from
seeing posts on Facebook, whereas he can on WhatsApp.
USENIX Association
29th USENIX Security Symposium    1957
P18: That’s because I can block my mom and aunts
from seeing my WhatsApp status updates and I can-
not block them from seeing my posts on Facebook.
Our participants also did not fully grasp the granular nature
of privacy settings on Facebook and therefore, they acted in
an absolute manner of blocking people from everything.
4.2.3 Users Often Manage Privacy And Phone Sharing
The majority of the participants reported that their access to
social media was restricted by the ‘WiFi limit’ or their data
limit on their mobile devices, which others noted affects In-
ternet usage [40, 53]. Most of the participants interviewed
in the townships only used their mobile phones for social
media access or used free Internet at a library, some visited
Internet cafes, or went online by borrowing a friend or family
member’s phone or in a few cases, a laptop at work. Thus,
phone sharing, a common practice amongst individuals from
lower income backgrounds [48] was mentioned frequently.
Participants in our study, similar to those in a study conducted
in Bangladesh [4], commonly shared their phones with oth-
ers. Often, sharing occurred between parents and children or
signiﬁcant others. Participants also talked about borrowing
a friend’s phone or lending their phone to others whose data
had run out. Therefore, our participants expressed concerns
about privacy issues stemming from physical access of the
phone, such as people they know accessing their private social
media account information on their own or shared devices.
In our study, participants mentioned managing privacy by
deleting messages immediately after texting with someone,
or putting passwords on apps so that their children had to
ask for the password to access speciﬁc apps. This self curat-
ing behavior was also noted in South Asia by women who
felt they had few other ways to manage privacy, especially
on shared devices, and was also reﬂected in Indian privacy
attitudes [36, 57]. Regarding social media privacy and phone
sharing speciﬁcally, for many users, there was a concern about
saved/auto-login features, features that save passwords on ap-
plications, that assume that only a single user accesses the
system. One participant, when asked if she experienced a
privacy breach, explained how auto-login could be an issue:
P26: There was a time that I didn’t have a phone
and I used to login on other people’s phones. So
people [logged in as me and] started posting nasty
stuff and upset other people on my behalf.
At least 5 participants reported that they logged out of social
media when accessing it on other people’s devices because
they were afraid of other people going through their personal
proﬁles and messages. Even if the participant remembered to
logout from the application, access to the phone could still be
enough to “prove” that the person who is on the device trying
to log in is the same as the social media account holder.
P3: There was a time when, my girlfriend at the
time, she went onto my Facebook. I was logged off.
She clicked ‘forgot password’. And when you click
forgot password, it goes to your email which was
on my phone. And then, she changed my password.
I wasn’t even there, but that happened. She changed
the password, accessed my Facebook, and read my
messages.
One or two of the individuals we interviewed tried to use
a combination of settings and tools, such as password locks
on the applications themselves through the use of a third-
party app "App Locker" to prevent others from accessing their
accounts. This echoes ﬁndings from South Asia where women
would often use app locking applications to manage their
privacy on devices that they share, often with a signiﬁcant
other with a power dynamic dictating they offer full access to
their content [57]. However, those participants who knew of
such settings or tools to enhance their privacy often decided
not to use them, explaining that the privacy they gained was
not worth the inconvenience of having to spend extra time
logging in to each application.
4.3 Crime And Social Media Behaviors
Many of our participants shared that ofﬂine concerns heavily
inﬂuenced their online privacy practices and feelings of secu-
rity online and in person. That is, physical safety concerns led
them to change both how they viewed and used social media
and shaped their mental models of privacy on social media.
4.3.1 Physical Danger And Social Media Posts
A concerning trend mentioned by some participants was the
tendency of criminals in their area to track people’s where-
abouts through social media activity. In particular, participants
mentioned that via catﬁshing, the practice of creating a false
identity online to deceive others, and other forms of social
engineering, malicious actors were luring others to more pri-
vate locations and then either raping or kidnapping them. In a
typical quote about these scams online, participant P25 said:
P25: It’s the scams that people do on Facebook;
I’ve heard of people luring other people with fake
job opportunities and kidnapping or raping them.
Others discussed encountering fake job vacancies posted to
get people isolated where they could be robbed. Participants
mentioned many other instances of crime. For instance, one
participant in Khayalitsha told of how she had been robbed
at least 4 times at gunpoint, with the assailants shooting at
her and stealing her phone. Another participant talked about
her son being stabbed; others talked about looking for news
online about car hijackings in the area or using social media
to contact a cousin whose house, a ‘shipping container’, had
burned down. Another talked about leaving their phone at
home to avoid getting mugged on their way to school.
Owing to crime being part of daily life, many participants
gave examples of how it affected their social media behaviors.
One participant mentioned that she delayed posting pictures
1958    29th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
on social media until one or two days after they are taken
to ensure nobody learns where she is in real-time. Another
participant spoke about how some people take the precaution
of not posting pictures of their children’s school uniform, to
try to hide where his children went to school from potential
kidnappers. One of the other participants discussed ensuring
his location was always turned off on social media so that
robbers would not know when he was away from home. In
a few cases, participants mentioned how they shared their
passwords for their accounts with family members in case
something happened to them. For instance, one participant
told us how their father can access her Facebook account in
case of ‘kidnapping’ so that they could be tracked down:
P32: Even my email address my dad knows the
password and when I used to a have a phone my
dad used to log in on my WhatsApp. The reason
is that if something happens to me like suicide or
kidnapping, it will help with the investigation. As
in, maybe this is what caused her to commit suicide.
Maybe they will see if I was going to meet up with
someone when I was kidnapped.
In another case, a mom talked about sharing her passwords
with her children so they could still access the shared phone
if ‘something happens to me’. Participants also spoke of how
Facebook was useful in high-crime areas. For instance, for
helping to track missing persons and advocating for a cause.
One person used it to ﬁnd a cousin that had gone missing.
P15: For instance, at one time, my cousin just dis-
appeared and no one knew where she was was but
because I knew her surname, I searched for her
on Facebook and we could locate her whereabouts.
Also, when there’s a missing person you can post
their picture on Facebook and there are groups that
help in situations like that.
Participants clearly did not always want real-time posting
to avoid physical threats resulting from others seeing their
live information. Crime also affected how users used social
media and what compromises they made to allow others to
ﬁnd them in case something happened to them.
4.3.2 Frequent Account Hacking
At least 12 participants talked about their Facebook accounts
being hacked at some point, requiring them to change their
password. For example, two of the participants expressed
concern that by gaining access to their passwords, bad ac-
tors would be able to take over their social media accounts
and impersonate them. Participant accounts were hacked in
numerous ways. In some cases, participants talked about for-
getting to log out at Internet cafes and having their accounts
hacked. In other cases, participants found out about the hack-
ing by seeing activity on their accounts they did not engage
in as P1 summarizes:
P1: On Facebook there was this one time where
my friend’s proﬁle, sent me a link to a video of
myself. I opened the link, and then next thing I
knew, my Facebook proﬁle was commenting on
people’s photos. I have no clue how that happened,
but then I changed my password and it was ﬁne.
In other cases, participants were alerted to hacking by
friends as in the case of P39:
P39: My Facebook had this thing where I could
not log in and I did not know why. Then I got com-
plaints from my friends that someone is using my
Facebook and I wondered: how do these people get
onto other people’s Facebook accounts? And these
fake people are setting up in meetings asking my
friends to meet up somewhere. The thing is that per-
son [who was contacted] had called me because the
person that was using my Facebook had mentioned
a location that I’ve never been to, so that person
was wondering what [was] going on.
In another case, a participant told us how someone had set
up an account with her cousin’s pictures and how she had to
help her cousin report the fake account to Facebook, equating
the outcome as Facebook being able to ‘block the person’.
Sometimes even if participants tried to deal with the hacking,
data issues prevented them from doing so as P39 told us that
when he tried to report this incident to Facebook ‘There was
just a lot that I had to read there and my data was getting
ﬁnished so I decided to just log out’. They eventually gave up
and started a new account instead. Overall, participants often
had difﬁculties with rampant account hacking.
4.3.3 Frequent Encounters of Inappropriate Or Crime
Related Content
Interestingly, participants not knowing a lot about privacy
settings also were left exposed to inappropriate content more
often than desired. Over a third of participants told us of fre-
quently encountering inappropriate content on their social
media accounts including nudity, pornography, and posts with
physical violence. For instance, participants mentioned receiv-
ing pornographic messages and videos on WhatsApp groups
or on WhatsApp as well as seeing pornographic content on
Facebook. In one case, a participant joined a group ‘Looking
for love’ only to ﬁnd out that instead of being associated with
the radio show they loved, sexual content was being shared
so they had to leave ‘immediately’.
P50: People take advantage and post nonsense.
They don’t care what they post. Some of them even
post inappropriate private stuff. Things we should
not see about them.
I: Have you ever come across a content that you did
not want to seen on Facebook?
P50: Yes, porn videos and people post whatever
USENIX Association
29th USENIX Security Symposium    1959
they feel like posting. Some of the things they post
are just not appropriate for one to see.
typical example, one participant, P45, shared the following
reason about which pictures she posts on Instagram:
Often, participants did not know how to deal with these
encounters or how to avoid this content. Sometimes these
pictures were crime related, other times it was pictures of
injuries or other disturbing images. For instance, P15 told us
of seeing a picture of a woman who was brutally murdered by
her husband and how it was ‘seriously disturbing’ and P25
mentioned seeing posts of ‘people cutting children’s throats’.
In another example, P18 spoke of:
P18: I have seen a picture of a little baby in a plastic
bag before and a picture of a child who was burnt
very badly. The caption on the picture of the burnt
child was asking for donations and help, that post
left me very disturbed. On those type of posts, it
asks you if you want to see the post again and then
I normally click the no option.
These posts often scared participants and made them feel
bad after viewing the content. In some cases, they were false
alarms such as people posting fake content about others pass-
