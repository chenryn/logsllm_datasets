User: Is there any eclipse plugin for python dependency management? just like what M2Eclipse does for maven project? so I can resolve all the dependencies and get ride off all the errors when I develop python using pydev.
If there is no such plugin, how do I resolve the dependencies, do I have to install the dependency modules locally?
Assistant: The only one so far I found available is PyFlakes, it does some level of dependency check and import validations.
