We ﬁrst evaluate the accuracy of the SPMTU test and the Traceroute test against
TBT. We can apply TBT to an address pair if both addresses’ routers draw their
fragment IDs from sequential counters. For aliases found by the Traceroute and
SPMTU tests, we ﬁnd TBT-applicable pairs and run TBT on them. Table 1
compares the accuracy of our tests against TBT.

Traceroute test: Using the Traceroute test, we ﬁnd 11,128 alias pairs from
21,854 UAv6-applicable preﬁxes. Of them, 2810 pairs (25.3 %) are TBT-
applicable. All but 4 of these pairs (0.14 %) are veriﬁed by TBT. We manu-
ally inspected these pairs and found that, although TBT indicates they have
non-sequential fragment IDs, all 4 pairs are veriﬁed by the address-based tech-
nique. In future work, we plan to examine in greater depth why these established
techniques contradict each other in some cases.
Recall that our central assumption is that if Y is the source of an AU response
to a packet for X0 or X3, then Y is directly connected to the preﬁx containing
X1 and X2. The Traceroute test provides us with some instances where this
assumption is violated. For example, in 527 cases (2.41 %), Y appears on the
paths to both X1 and X2. In 55 other cases (0.25 %), Y is more than one hop
away from X1 or X2, which indicates that Y is not directly connected to the
preﬁx. We detect these cases and discard them.
SPMTU test: The SPMTU test ﬁnds 8422 alias pairs. For the 1263 (15.0 %)
alias pairs where TBT could be applied, TBT veriﬁed all the alias pairs found by
SPMTU except one. We manually inspected this case and found that SPMTU no
longer identiﬁed the pair as aliases. We recovered the fragment IDs that we had
UAv6: Alias Resolution in IPv6 Using Unused Addresses
145
obtained when we ﬁrst ran SPMTU upon them, and found that the fragment
IDs for both addresses in that run had been sequential. We believe that one of
the addresses from the pair was reassigned to another router in the sub-24 h gap
between our SPMTU run and our TBT run, causing the results to conﬂict.
Comparison between disambiguation tests: We now compare the aliases
found by our disambiguation tests against each other. The union of alias pairs
found by the SPMTU and Traceroute tests contains 15,260 pairs, and the inter-
section has 4289 pairs. There is one alias pair where the two tests conﬂict.
The alias pair chosen by the traceroute test was conﬁrmed by the address-based
method, whereas the pair chosen by SPMTU was conﬁrmed by TBT. We believe
that this behavior is caused by a misconﬁgured router responding to probes not
addressed to it.
UAv6 is complementary to TBT: We observe that 11,721 (76.8 %) alias
pairs found by UAv6 are not TBT-applicable, demonstrating that UAv6 is a
complementary technique to TBT. For aliases found by the Traceroute test, we
ﬁnd that 74.7 % are not TBT-applicable. 54 % of these alias pairs do not respond
with fragments after a PTB message and 46 % respond with random fragments.
Like TBT, the SPMTU test also relies upon fragments received from the
addresses. Yet SPMTU diﬀers from TBT in that it relies upon shared PMTU
caches in routers while TBT relies upon shared sequential counters from which
the fragment ID is drawn. The majority of aliases found by the SPMTU test
(85.0 %) are not TBT-applicable. This implies that at least one of the addresses
in the pair returned fragments not derived from a sequential counter. How-
ever, Speedtrap [12] had found in their tests that all routers which implemented
shared PMTU caches also used sequential counters. We believe that at least
one main router manufacturer is now implementing shared PMTU caches and
non-sequential counters on its routers.
5.3.2 Comparison with Ground Truth
We next study UAv6’s accuracy using ground truth data from the Internet2
network [10]. We obtained ground truth aliases from Internet2 routers’ conﬁg-
uration ﬁles. We believe these aliases to be correct, although we omitted some
interfaces that are not physical interfaces. The Internet2 topology consists of
579 interface addresses on 11 routers. We obtain the /126 preﬁx of each inter-
face address and run the harvest phase upon the preﬁx. Of the 500 /126 preﬁxes
from the Internet2 dataset, we ﬁnd 62 (12.4 %) candidate alias pair sets. The
number is small since many preﬁxes in Internet2 did not respond in the harvest
phase.
For each candidate alias pair set, we apply the disambiguation phase and
show the results in Table 2. Not all aliases found by the tests could be veriﬁed:
some aliases are aliases of routers connected to Internet2 routers, but not of the
Internet2 routers themselves. For these aliases, we do not have ground truth,
and thus cannot verify them. The Traceroute test found 31 such aliases and the
SPMTU test found 22 of them. The Traceroute test found 6 alias pairs that
146

belonged to Internet2 routers, and the SPMTU test found 15 such pairs. All of
these aliases were veriﬁed by ground truth, demonstrating UAv6’s accuracy.

5.4 Alias Resolution with UAv6 and the Address-Based Method
We close this section by investigating how many aliases each technique ﬁnds
within the 68,474 router interface addresses extracted from the Ark project in
July 2014 [4]. For this comparison, we use the number of aliases that each tech-
nique ﬁnds instead of comparing the number of alias pairs, because a router
alias pairs, but only n− 1 aliases. We believe this is an
with n interfaces has
unbiased way of measuring the completeness of an alias resolution technique.

(cid:2)
We combine the alias pairs we found using UAv6 and the address-based
technique and show the results in Table 3. Though UAv6 found only 67 % more
alias pairs than the address-based technique, it found nearly double the aliases
within the addresses already discovered by Ark. Of course, both UAv6 and
address-based methods may discover new addresses that were not present in
a traceroute measurement. Resolving aliases of interfaces already discovered by
traceroute contributes accuracy to an inferred router-level map, while discover-
ing new addresses yields additional detail. However, there were 1407 aliases that
the address-based technique alone resolved. Combining the approaches yielded
34 % more aliases than the use of UAv6 alone.

6 Conclusions
IPv6 deployment is on the rise and alias resolution techniques are vital in map-
ping its topology. In this work, we augmented existing alias resolution methods
with UAv6: a new technique that uses partially used IPv6 preﬁxes to ﬁnd aliases.
We found potential alias pairs by probing /126 preﬁxes and introduced two tests
UAv6: Alias Resolution in IPv6 Using Unused Addresses
147
to disambiguate potential alias pairs. Existing alias resolution techniques and
ground truth from the Internet2 topology conﬁrmed UAv6’s accuracy. UAv6 is
complementary to the address-based technique and to TBT, ﬁnding alias pairs
that other techniques do not.
The disambiguation tests we employ in this work helped UAv6 recover aliases
from 70 % of applicable preﬁxes, and we believe this can be increased further.
For instance, one area of future work is to employ other disambiguation tests,
such as the Hop Limit on received packets, to ﬁnd more aliases. Additionally,
we believe that, through the use of multiple vantage points, UAv6 can harvest
more applicable preﬁxes.
