around 15%. Moreover, the attackers can use context infor-
mation to improve the detection accuracy because the usage
patterns of such appliances are related to the context. For
example, there is a high probability that the air conditioner is
working on a hot summer day. The refrigerator is more likely
to be working at high power level on weekends because people
usually do grocery shopping on weekends. Based on infor-
mation like this (obtained from weather history), probability-
based attacks can be applied to further improve the detection
accuracy.
Even without considering these context
information, as
shown in Table II, the good performance of our attack demon-
strates that reactive power alone can reveal user privacy and
new defense techniques are needed.
V. REACTIVE POWER OBFUSCATION
In this section, we ﬁrst present the design of RPO and then
evaluate its performance.
A. System Model and Basic Idea
Fig. 12 shows the system model of RPO, which mainly
consists of a smart meter, home appliances, a controllable
capacitor with relatively large capacitance, and a control
circuit. The general idea is as follows. The control circuit
controls the capacitor to provide or store reactive power so
that the reactive power ﬂuctuations caused by appliances (net
demand) will be smoothed out, and will not be shown in
the smart meter. By reducing the power ﬂuctuations measured
by the smart meter, less appliance usage information can be
inferred by the attackers. Thus, RPO aims to reduce the power
ﬂuctuations by maintaining the reactive power at a target value.
Since the power usage of households may change dramatically

and there are some physical limitations in the electric systems,
RPO has to address many technical challenges.
B. Design of RPO
To prevent the leakage of appliance ON/OFF information
from reactive power data, RPO aims to keep the reactive power
around a target value. To achieve this goal, RPO has three
processes: initialization, maintaining, and adjusting, which are
introduced below using notations in Table III.
• Initialization Process: RPO initializes the target reactive
power Rc based on the household’s power usage history
and the capacitance of the capacitor.
• Maintaining Process: For any given time t, RPO controls
the capacitor to store and provide reactive power based
on the relationship between the net demand r(t) and
the target demand Rc. When r(t) rises beyond Rc,
the capacitor should start providing reactive power to
compensate for the extra load. When r(t) drops below
Rc, the capacitor should start storing reactive power to
consume extra power supply.
• Adjusting Process: When the capacitor is not able to
maintain the current target demand, RPO adjusts Rc to a
new value.
1) Initialization Process: The target reactive power Rc
affects the performance. If Rc is not properly chosen, it will
have to be frequently adjusted. When selecting the initial value
of Rc, the capacitor should have enough capacitance to keep
the reactive power demand maintained at Rc based on the
given usage history. Also, the capacitor should not exceed its
breakdown voltage Vbd. According to the principles of electric

circuits, the above conditions can be written as follows:
r(t) + c(t) = Rc and |c(t)|  0 :
≤ 0 :
start providing reactive power;
start storing reactive power.
r(t) − Rc serves as the control signal for the Storing/ Pro-
viding module. When r(t) − Rc is positive, it signals the
Storing/Providing module to start providing reactive power;
when r(t) − Rc is negative, it signals the Storing/Providing
module to start storing reactive power.
Storing/Providing Module The storing and providing mod-
ule directs the ﬂow of the reactive power from/to the capacitor.
There are various methods to charge/discharge the capacitor.
Since our goal is to maintain the reactive power of the house-
hold at a stable level, we choose the constant current/constant
voltage (CICV) method. At the beginning of the charge cycle,
our storing and providing module should operate in constant
current mode. In this way, a constant current is provided to
the capacitor such that its voltage increases linearly. When the
capacitor is charged to a target voltage, the our module should
enter a constant voltage loop and accurately controls the
capacitor charge level to be constant to avoid over charging.
To control the capacitor in the above way, the control circuit
we design must satisfy the following:
Fig. 14: Combining the three modules with a negative feed-
back ampliﬁer
• The control circuit can operate at two regulation modes:
constant current and constant voltage.
• Transitions between different regulation modes should be
automatic.
• The control circuit should have an accurate current sense
ampliﬁer that can operate at supply voltage of the system.
To achieve this goal, we use the Intersil’s ISL78268 controller
[33], which consist of MOSFET driver, ampliﬁers, didoes
and ﬂip-ﬂops, as shown in Fig. 13. ISL78268 is used as
the controller for the large capacitance capacitor (red in the
ﬁgure). Other components in the ﬁgure are used to connect
the controller with the capacitor so that the capacitor can
store reactive power or provide reactive power as needed. The
maximum current allowed in ISL78268 is 3 A, which means
that there will be an upper-bound of the reactive power stored
in the capacitor. If more reactive power needs to be reserved,
a group of ISL78268 controllers can be combined in parallel
to achieve larger capacity.
In order for RPO to work as designed, the two modules
should be combined functionally so that the reactive power
from the capacitor can offset the reactive power of the home
appliances. In other words, we need to add the providing
amount to the net demand or subtract the storing amount from
the net demand. To achieve this goal, an ampliﬁer is used as
shown in Fig. 14. In the ﬁgure, the two resistance Rin and
Rf and the ampliﬁer form a negative feedback circuit so that
reactive power can be added to or subtracted from the net
demand according to the relationship between r(t) and Rc.
According to the principles of electric circuits:
(cid:8)
r(t) − Rc
> 0 : u(t) = r(t) − Rin/Rf · |c(t)|
≤ 0 : u(t) = r(t) + Rin/Rf · |c(t)|
If Rc and the capacitor are chosen properly, the obfuscated
reactive load u(t) will not change much when the states of
appliances are changed.
3) Adjusting Process: The initialization of Rc is based on
the usage history. It is possible that some time later, the power
consumption of the appliances r(t) changes dramatically com-
pared to historic data and the capacitor fails to maintain u(t)
at Rc. There are two failure cases:
• High Demand: When the current reactive power demand
of appliances is very high, even if the capacitor releases
20
all the stored power, the obfuscated reactive power de-
mand still rises beyond the target level.
• Low Demand: When the current reactive power demand
of appliances is very low, even when the capacitor is full,
the obfuscated reactive power demand still falls below the
target level.
When such failures occur, the reactive power load captured
by the smart meter will change as the appliance usage pattern
changes. In order to preserve privacy after such failures, Rc
needs to be adjusted.
If a failure is caused by low demand, the capacitor is already
fully charged but the overall reactive power demand u(t) is
still not enough (below Rc). Rc should be adjusted to a lower
value. If a failure is caused by high demand, the capacitor has
already released all its stored reactive power but u(t) is still
too high (above Rc). Rc should be adjusted to a higher value.
In RPO, Rc is adjusted according to Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 Adjustment of Rc
1: Suppose at time tf , a failure occurs and the maximum
reactive power can be stored by the capacitor is rmax
Rc = u(tf ) + CR · rmax
2: if u(tf ) > Rc then
3:
4: end if
5: if u(tf )  u(tf ) − rmax. The high demand failure only
occurs when the capacitor is providing all its reactive power.
Thus, u(tf ) > rmax and Rc is assured to be positive.
4) Cost and Usability: The cost of RPO is a very important
factor that should be considered since it will affect whether
RPO can be deployed in practice. We evaluate the cost of
RPO in two aspects: the power consumption of RPO and the
monetary cost of its components.
The resistors used in RPO will consume energy (active
power). According to the concept of active power and Ohm’s
law, we have:
P =
1
T
(1 − cos 2ωt)dt = U I = I
2
R =
U I
t
U 2
R
where U is the average voltage over the resistor, I is the
average current through the resistor, and R is the resistance.
For those resistors that are connected to the circuit in series,
small resistance (e.g., 0.05 ohm) should be chosen; for those
resistors that are connected to the circuit in parallel, large
resistance (e.g., 100k ohm) should be chosen. In this way,
the active power consumed by each resistor is very small.
In US, the average voltage in residential power supply is
110 V . The maximum current allowed by ISL78268 is 3 A.
Thus, the upper bound for U is 110 V and the upper bound
for I is 3 A. We can calculate the maximum possible power
(cid:2) T
0
consumed by the resistors:
For parallel resistors: 1102
For serial resistors: 3
105 = 0.121W ;
2 · 0.05 = 0.45W.
In our RPO design, we use 10 resistors connected in parallel
and 5 resistors connected in serial. Thus, the maximum power
consumption of RPO should be 10∗0.121+5∗0.45 = 3.46 W ,
which is less than 5 W . Since the power consumption of RPO
is small, it will not introduce noticeable changes to the smart
meter readings. With RPO deployed, the smart meter data can
still perform its functions as desired.
RPO uses an ISL78268 controller, a supercapacitor with
large capacitance and other small components such as re-
sistors, ampliﬁers, inductors and diodes. The unit price for
the ISL78268 controller is less than $10. The super-capacitor
needed for a household is about $50-$100. The unit price for
other small components is at cent level (they usually sell in
bulks) and the total cost should be less that $5. Thus, the
overall cost of RPO is less that $150, which is acceptable,
and can be largely deployed.
C. Compatibility of RPO
RPO focuses on addressing the privacy leakage caused by
reactive power. Although it is not designed to address active
power-based privacy attacks, it is compatible with existing
battery-based approaches [34], [14], [15] which can mask
active power usage from the smart meter.
As mentioned in Section III-B, active power and reactive
power are orthogonal in the vector space and they do not
interfere with each other. Thus, RPO can be combined with
battery-based approaches to deal with privacy leakage from
smart metering data; i.e., capacitor is used to store and provide
reactive power data to mask reactive power usage while battery
is used to mask the active power usage.
VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
In this section, we ﬁrst present the metrics used in the
evaluation, and then present the evaluation results using these
metrics.
A. Metrics
1) Vulnerability Factor: The attacker infers appliance usage
information from the changes in the waveform, and better pri-
vacy can be achieved if fewer changes exist in the obfuscated
waveform. To measure the maximum information leakage
before and after RPO is implemented, we deﬁne vulnerability
factor as the entropy of a reactive power waveform. In
information theory, the entropy for signal X with probability
mass function P is deﬁned as:
H(X) = − n(cid:9)
P(xi) logb P(xi),
i=1
In this paper, b = 2 is used as the standard base. The
probability mass function P for the load proﬁle is deﬁned

where I() is an indicator function calculated as

Here, X is the reactive power load waveform and xi is the
reactive power load at time slot i. The entropy H(X) can
be interpreted as an upper bound on the information (the
number of bits) that the attacker can extract from the reactive
power waveform. A smaller vulnerability factor means less
information leakage and better privacy.
2) Obfuscation Factor: The vulnerability factor measures
to what degree the load proﬁle can leak user privacy (i.e.,
user’s appliance usage information). It shows the upper bound
of the amount of information that can be inferred from the
load proﬁle. To further quantify how much privacy RPO can
provide, it is desirable to show how different the obfuscated
