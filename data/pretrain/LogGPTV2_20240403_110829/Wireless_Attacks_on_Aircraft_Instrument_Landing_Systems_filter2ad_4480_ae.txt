sues in the aviation industry can be ﬁxed by implementing
some sort of cryptographic authentication, they are ineffective
against the ILS attacks demonstrated in this paper.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we presented a ﬁrst security evaluation of aircraft
instrument landing system against wireless attacks. Through
both simulations and experiments using aviation grade com-
mercial ILS receivers and FAA recommended ﬂight simulator,
we showed that an attacker can precisely control the approach
path of an aircraft without alerting the pilots, especially during
low-visibility conditions. We discussed potential countermea-
sures including failsafe systems such as GPS and showed that
these systems do not provide sufﬁcient security guarantees
and there are unique challenges to realizing a scalable and
secure aircraft landing system.
