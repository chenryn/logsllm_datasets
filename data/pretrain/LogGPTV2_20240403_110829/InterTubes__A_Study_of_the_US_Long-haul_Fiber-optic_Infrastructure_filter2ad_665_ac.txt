for an individual ISP) with standard error bars, 25th and 75th
percentile are shown in Figure 6. The average values are
plotted in a sorted fashion, resulting in an increasing level
of infrastructure sharing when reading the plot from left to
right.
From this plot we observe that Suddenlink has the small-
est average number of ISPs that share the conduits used in
its network, which can be explained by its diverse geograph-
ical deployments. It is followed by EarthLink and Level 3.
Deutsche Telekom, NTT and XO, on the other hand, use
conduits that are, on average, shared by a large number of
other ISPs.
Implication: Non-US service providers (e.g., Deutsche
Telekom, NTT, Tata, etc.) use policies like dig once [25]
and open trench [55], and/or lease dark ﬁbers to expand
their presence in the US. Such policies may save deployment

costs, but appear to be counter-productive as far as overall
network resilience is concerned.
How similar are ISP risk proﬁles? Using the risk matrix
we calculate the Hamming [39] distance similarity metric
among ISPs, i.e., by comparing every row in the risk matrix
to every other row to assess their similarity. Our intuition for
using such a metric is that if two ISPs are physically similar
(in terms of ﬁber deployments and the level of infrastructure
sharing), their risk proﬁles are also similar.
Figure 8 shows a heat map generated by computing the
Hamming distance metric for every pair of ISPs considered
in the construction of our physical map. For this metric, the
smaller the number, the greater the shared risk between the
corresponding (two) ISPs. We observe in the plot that Earth-
Link and Level 3 exhibit fairly low risk proﬁles among the
ISPs we considered, similar to results described above when
we consider the average number of ISPs sharing conduits
used in these networks. These two ISPs are followed by Cox,
Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which likely exhibit lower
risk according to the Hamming distance metric due to their
rich ﬁber connectivity in the US.

ming distance.
Somewhat surprisingly, although the average number of
ISPs that share conduits in Suddenlink’s network is, on aver-
age, low, the Hamming distance metric suggests that it is ex-
posed to risks due to its geographically diverse deployments.
While Level 3 and EarthLink also have geographically di-
verse deployments, they also have diverse paths that can
be used to reach various destinations without using highly-

On the other hand, Suddenlink has few
alternate physical paths, thus they must depend on certain
highly-shared conduits to reach certain locations. TATA,
TeliaSonera, Deutsche Telekom, NTT and XO each use con-
duits that are very highly shared, thus they have similar risk
proﬁles according to the Hamming distance metric.
Implication: Multiple metrics are required to precisely char-
acterize and capture the level of infrastructure sharing by
service providers. Geographically diverse deployment may
reduce the risk only when the ISP has diverse paths to avoid
the critical choke points to reach different destinations.
4.3 Risk Metric: Connectivity + Trafﬁc
In this section, we follow the method of [99] and use the
popularity of different routes on the Internet as measured
through traceroute probes as a way to infer relative volumes
of trafﬁc on those routes. We use traceroute data from the
Edgescope [80] project and restrict our analysis to a period
of 3 months, from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2014. These
data consisted of 4,908,223 individual traceroutes by clients
in diverse locations. By using geolocation information and
naming hints in the traceroute data [78, 92], we are able to
overlay individual layer 3 links onto our underlying physi-
cal map of Internet infrastructure. As a result, we are able
to identify those components of the long-haul ﬁber-optic in-
frastructure which experience high levels of infrastructure
sharing as well as high volumes of trafﬁc.
The prevalent use of MPLS tunnels in the Internet [101]
poses one potential pitfall with overlaying observed layer 3
routes onto our physical map. While we certainly do see seg-
ments along individual traceroutes that likely pass through
MPLS tunnels, we observe the frequency of these segments
to be relatively low. Thus, we believe that their impact on
the results we describe below is limited.
Ranking by frequency. Table 2 and Table 3 show the top
20 conduits for west-origin east-bound and east-origin west-
bound probes7 ranked based on frequency.
Interestingly,
for these tables we observe high volumes of trafﬁc ﬂow-
ing through certain cities (e.g., Dallas, TX, Salt Lake City,
UT) in either direction, and that while many of the conduit
endpoints are major population centers, there are a number
of endpoint cities that are simply popular waypoints (e.g.,
Casper, WY and Billings, MT in the East to West direction).
Additional ISPs. Figure 9 compares the CDF of the number
of ISPs sharing a conduit with a CDF of conduit frequencies
observed through the traceroute data.
In the plot, we ob-
serve that the conduits identiﬁed in our physical map appear
on large numbers of paths in the traceroute data, and that
when we consider trafﬁc characteristics, the shared risk of
certain conduits is only greater. Through analysis of nam-
ing conventions in the traceroute data, we infer that there are
even larger numbers of ISPs that share the conduits identi-
ﬁed in our physical map, thus the potential risks due to in-
frastructure sharing are magniﬁed when considering trafﬁc
characteristics. For example, our physical map establishes
that the conduit between Portland, OR and Seattle, WA is

inferred the presence of an additional 13 ISPs that also share
that conduit.

Distribution of trafﬁc. We also ranked the ISPs based on
the number of conduits used to carry trafﬁc. Table 4 lists
the top 10 ISPs in terms of number of conduits observed to
carry traceroute trafﬁc. We see that Level 3’s infrastructure
is the most widely used. Using the traceroute frequencies as
a proxy, we also infer that Level 3 carries the most trafﬁc.
In fact, it has a signiﬁcantly higher number of conduits used
compared to the next few “top” ISPs. Interestingly, although
XO is also considered to be a Tier-1 provider, it carries ap-
proximately 25% of the volume that Level 3 carries, at least
inferred through these data.

the difference in the number of ISPs sharing the conduit on
the original path versus the optimized path.
Figure 10 shows the PI and SRR results for optimizing
the 12 highly-shared links, for all ISPs considered in our
study. Overall, these plots show that, on average, an addition
of between one and two conduits that were not previously
used by a particular ISP results in a signiﬁcant reduction in
shared risk across all networks. We observe that nearly all
the beneﬁt of shared risk reduction is obtained through these
modest additions.
Apart from ﬁnding optimal paths with minimum shared
risk, the robustness suggestion optimization framework can
also be used to infer additional peering (hops) that can im-
prove the overall robustness of the network. Table 5 shows
the top three beneﬁcial peering additions based on minimiz-
ing shared risk in the network for the twelve most highly-
shared links. Level 3 is predominantly the best peer that any
ISP could add to improve robustness, largely due to their
already-robust infrastructure. AT&T and CenturyLink are
also prominent peers to add, mainly due to the diversity in
geographic paths that border on the 12 highly-shared links.

5 Mitigating Risks
In this section we describe two optimization analyses in
which we examine how best to improve the existing physical
infrastructure to either increase the robustness of long-haul
infrastructure to ﬁber cuts, or to minimize propagation delay
between pairs of cities.
5.1
Increasing Network Robustness (I)
We ﬁrst examine the possibility of improving the long-
haul infrastructure’s robustness (i.e., to reduce the impact of
ﬁber cuts by reducing the level of conduit sharing among
ISPs8) by either (1) utilizing existing conduits that are not
currently part of that ISPs physical footprint, or (2) care-
fully choosing ISPs to peer with at particular locations such
that the addition of the peer adds diversity in terms of phys-
ical conduits utilized. In either case, we rely on the exist-
ing physical infrastructure and the careful choice of conduits
rather than introduce any new links.
We call the optimization framework used in this ﬁrst anal-
ysis a robustness suggestion, as it is designed to ﬁnd a set
of links or set of ISPs to peer with at different points in the
network such that global shared risk (i.e., shared risk across
all ISPs) is minimized. We refer to this set of additional
