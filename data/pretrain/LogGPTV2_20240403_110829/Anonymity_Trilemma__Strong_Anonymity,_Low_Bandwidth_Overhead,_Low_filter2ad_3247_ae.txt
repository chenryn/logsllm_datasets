non-negligible, and hence
though c has a small value, (cid:4) is also small. Hence, it is unlikely
that the challenge message will mix with a message from
u1−b at some honest node. Thus, strong anonymity cannot
be achieved.

Pr [Y ] ≤ E + (1 − E) 1 ≤ 1 ≤ 1 − (1 − E) (1 − 2fp((cid:4))).
Thus, δ ≥ 1− Pr [Y ] ≥ (1− E) (1 − 2fp((cid:4))) . We now use
Markov’s Inequality on X and derive E = Pr [X ≥ 2μ] ≤ 1
2,
which means, δ ≥ 1
Note that in the proof of Theorem 6, in case p is a constant and
N is a very high value, then E goes towards zero and instead
of using Markov’s inequality, we can derive δ ≥ 1 − 2fp((cid:4)).
B. Impossibility for Strong Anonymity
Theorem 7. For user distribution UP and p > 0, no protocol
Π ∈ M can achieve strong anonymity if 2(cid:4)p  1− neg(η), but still no protocol
can achieve strong anonymity.
Interesting Cases. Now we are going to discuss a few
interesting cases for different values of (cid:4), p, and N.

2 − fp((cid:4)) = 0. Since p(cid:4) = 1, in (cid:4) rounds the

protocol has 1 message per user on an average. So, the protocol
has a high chance of winning. Whereas in Section V-B, we
saw that Πideal can win with absolute certainty in this case.
2τ , (cid:4) = τ, τ is a positive integer: even for τ > 2,
fp((cid:3)) = 1−(1 − p)(cid:3)  0.05. Even
though 2(cid:4)p = 1, strong anonymity can not be achieved. In an
expected scenario, in a slice of (cid:4) rounds only p(cid:4) = 1

the total users send messages, and hence there is a signiﬁcant
chance that u1−b is in the other half. Note that this is different
2) p = 1
9, (cid:4) = 3: Here, fp((cid:3)) = 1−(1 − p)(cid:3) = 1−(cid:5)
from the scenario with synchronized users where Πideal could
achieve strong anonymity in this case (c.f. Section V-B).
3) p = 1
 0.21; because of low values of both p
and (cid:4) only a few users send messages within the interval of
(cid:4) rounds, and hence the protocol has a small chance to win.
As in Section V-B, Πideal can not achieve strong anonymity
in this case, since the necessary constraints are not satisﬁed.

We derive the bound in Theorem 8 by combining the
techniques presented in Section VI and Section VII. Since
the proof does not introduce novel techniques, we omit it and
instead refer the interested reader to Appendix B for the proof.

both conditions are necessary to achieve strong anonymity.

To make δ negligible, it sufﬁces that F1 or F2 become
negligible. Unlike Section VI, here fp((cid:4) − c) and fp(c) are
independent, which allows us to analyze F1 and F2 inde-
pendently. First, F1 is similar to the δ-bound in Section VII,
except that we consider fp((cid:4) − c) instead of fp((cid:4)). Hence,
the analysis of F1 is analogous to Section VII-B. Second,

F2 is negligible if both [1 − 1/
