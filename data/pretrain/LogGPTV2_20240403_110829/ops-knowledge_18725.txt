Assistant: This log chunk shows a series of errors and resets related to the switch_module. It begins with a log entry from 2006-04-02 indicating fan speeds, followed by four more entries from the same day with the same fan speeds. The next entry is from 2005-03-26 and indicates a command has been aborted. The following entries are from 2004 and indicate power/control problems, link errors, and a link in reset. The log ends with an entry from 2006-03-18 indicating a link error on a broadcast tree.
