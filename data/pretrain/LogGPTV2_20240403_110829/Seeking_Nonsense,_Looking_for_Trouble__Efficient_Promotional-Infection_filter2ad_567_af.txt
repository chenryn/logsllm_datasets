### Further Analysis and Findings

#### Application Beyond sTLDs
Even for generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs), which typically have diverse and less specific semantics, the malicious content uploaded to these domains often does not align with the compromised websites' themes. This suggests that our approach can be extended beyond sponsored Top-Level Domains (sTLDs). Below, we present our findings.

#### sTLDs as Soft Targets
To understand the importance of sTLDs to adversaries, we compared compromised sTLD sites with those under gTLDs within the same attack campaign. A campaign in this context includes a set of websites infected to promote unauthorized or malicious content, sharing common features such as pointing to the same target site, having similar malicious URLs (e.g., the same affiliate ID as a URL parameter), and sharing the same redirection chain. In our research, we identified campaigns through the "link-farm" structure, where a compromised site points to another. By following the links on compromised sTLD sites, we reached a set of infected gTLD sites, primarily under .com. We then compared the features of these sites with sTLD domains in terms of Alexa rank, PageRank (PR), and lifetime, to determine which TLD domains are more valuable for promotional infections.

**Table IV: Top 3 Link-Farm Campaigns with Most Injected sTLD Domains**

| Name          | # sTLD Domains | # gTLD Domains | # Countries | Promotion Content |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Campaign 1    | 872            | 3,426          | 12          | Gambling          |
| Campaign 2    | 148            | 5,210          | 7           | Cheating          |
| Campaign 3    | 60             | 5,198          | 15          | Drug              |

**Figure 9:**
- **(a)** Cumulative distribution of Alexa global ranks per site in three campaigns.
- **(b)** Cumulative distribution of Alexa bounce rate per site in three campaigns.
- **(c)** Distribution of infection duration for injected pages in sTLD and gTLD sites.
- **(d)** Cumulative distribution of semantic distance per monitored site.

From the figures, 50%-75% of sTLD sites are ranked within the Alexa top 1M, while only 10%-30% of gTLD sites achieve this. Over 40% of gTLD sites have an Alexa rank outside the top 5M, whereas less than 20% of sTLDs fall into this category. In terms of PageRank, over 30% of sTLD sites have a PR from 4 to 6, while fewer than 5% of gTLD sites have a PR in this range. More than half of gTLD sites have a PR of 0, indicating weaker SEO effectiveness compared to high-PR sites. This suggests that sTLD sites generally have a stronger impact on promoting content than low-PR gTLD sites.

We also compared the infection durations for these two types of domains. We continuously crawled the compromised pages (identified between August and September 2015) every two days from September to November 2015 to check if the infections persisted. As shown in Figure 9(c), gTLD sites were cleaned up more quickly than sTLD sites. Over 25% of gTLD sites were cleaned within 10 days, while only 12% of sTLD sites were cleaned in the same period.

Our study demonstrates that sTLDs are higher-ranked and more effective in elevating the ranks of promoted content, making them more valuable for promotional infections. Additionally, they are less protected than gTLDs, with infections persisting for longer periods once compromised. This indicates that sTLDs are indeed valuable assets to adversaries, and effective protection, as provided by SEISE, can significantly reduce the effectiveness of promotional attacks.

#### Extension to gTLDs
Compared to sTLDs, gTLDs (e.g., .com, .net, .org) do not have fixed semantic meanings. However, we found that the malicious content injected into gTLDs often remains semantically inconsistent with the site's content, which can be detected by search engine results. For example, the injected page on iceriversprings.com, a bottled water brand, promotes "payday loans," which is semantically inconsistent.

We measured the semantic inconsistency on 3,000 randomly sampled gTLD sites from the aforementioned campaigns using the Context Analyzer component in SEISE. The Context Analyzer calculates the semantic distance between the generic content of known injected sites (the reference, e.g., the search result of the query `site:iceriversprings.com`) and the results of querying IBTs on these sites, which mostly contain injected malicious content (e.g., `site:iceriversprings.com "payday loan"`).

However, some compromised gTLD sites showed semantic consistency with the promotional content. For instance, the online drug library `druglibrary.org` (in Campaign 3) was injected to promote "cheap xanax." To identify suspicious sites before using the Context Analyzer, we utilized the similarsites website query API to fetch site tags (e.g., "recycling" and "water" for `site:iceriversprings.com`) to determine a gTLD site's semantics. Only gTLD sites showing semantic inconsistency with the IBT (i.e., the site's tags are semantically distant from the IBT) were considered as suspicious candidates for the Context Analyzer.

This filtering step, built as the Semantic Comparator, accepts a threshold for the IBT semantic distance and outputs candidate gTLD sites with significant semantic distances from the IBT. For example, `iceriversprings.com`, which has site tags "recycling" and "water," shows semantic inconsistency with the IBT "payday loan" and is flagged as a suspicious FQDN.

**Figure 10: Example of Search Engine Results for an Injected gTLD Site (`iceriversprings.com`)**

**Figure 9(d):** Shows the semantic distances between the reference and the search results of querying an IBT with and without the Semantic Comparator. The Context Analyzer can still identify semantic inconsistencies, particularly with the help of the Semantic Comparator. 97% of the injected sites have a semantic distance greater than 0.8 when the Semantic Comparator threshold is set to 0.9, compared to 85% without the comparator.

We also measured the semantic inconsistency of unknown injected gTLD sites. This is nontrivial because searching for `site:.com "payday loan"` returns mostly legitimate results. High-PR gTLD sites tend to appear at the top of search results, making them less likely to be compromised. To address this, we used long IBTs (word length > 4) to find lower-PR sites more likely to be compromised. For example, searching for "payday loan no credit check" under .com returned `iceriversprings.com` and `carolinaatm.com` among the top-10 results.

In our experiments, we used 1,000 long IBTs in 10 categories, collecting 23,098 gTLD FQDNs for semantic inconsistency analysis. With the Context Analyzer threshold set to 0.9, 7,430 gTLD FQDNs were reported to have promotional infections. We manually checked 400 results (200 injected and 200 not-injected) and confirmed 182 infections and 196 non-infections, giving us a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 9% and a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 8.4%.

#### Case Studies

**Exploit Kit Discovered:**
We found an exploit toolkit, called xise, used in multiple gambling campaigns, such as Campaign 1. xise, discovered on a cloud drive, has functionalities for automatic site collection, shell acquisition, customized injected page generation, and evasion techniques like redirection cloaking and code obfuscation. It automatically discovers high-profile websites from Google and scans for vulnerabilities in components like phpMyAdmin, KindEditor, UEditor, Alipay, and FCKeditor. The tool generates and injects pages along specific paths and uploads a configuration file to perform redirection cloaking. It also ensures the malicious content is indexed by search engines. We generated signatures for xise, and 1,037 sTLD sites related to xise had an average semantic distance of 0.87.

**Academic Cheating Infections:**
Our research also uncovered many infections promoting academic cheating sites, providing services for preparing homework and taking online tests for students. These attacks primarily targeted .edu domains, with effective IBTs including "free essay" and "cheap term paper." SEISE detected 428 compromised sites, including high-profile .edu domains like mit.edu, princeton.edu, and harvard.edu. Table VI compares the compromised .edu sites in different keyword categories, showing that such malicious activities have become a global industry, with 119 education TLDs in 109 countries having 428 infected domains. The top 3 education TLDs with the most infected sites are .edu (23%), .edu.mn (11%), and .edu.cn (7%).

| Category         | # FQDN | # Domains | Performance (term query per site) |
|------------------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Academic Cheating | 470    | 428       | 2.2                              |
| Gambling         | 589    | 367       | 2.8                              |

| Financial        | 401    | 327       | 3.0                              |
| Adult            | 260    | 214       | 3.2                              |

### Discussion

Our research demonstrates that semantic inconsistency search is highly effective against promotional infections. However, adversaries may attempt to evade detection by setting robots.txt to prevent content from being scanned. Such evasion techniques, however, would defeat the purpose of promotional infections, which rely on search engine exposure. Future research should focus on developing new techniques to further reduce FDR and improve coverage, and on automatically discovering query terms for detection.
