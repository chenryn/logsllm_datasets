With the support now for .tsx and .ts files, it is possible to have multiple
input files with the same root name in a compilation (i.e. `file1.ts` and
`file1.tsx`). Both of these may try to generate the same output file on
compilation (i.e. `file1.js`), and only one will win. If/when more extensions
for input (or output) files are added, this will exacerbate the problem.
TypeScript should detect collisions on emitted files and error. (Ideally for
resilience and future proofing, it should also detect if an emitted file would
overwrite one of the input files).
