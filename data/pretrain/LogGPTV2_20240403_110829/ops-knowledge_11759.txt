User: Currently running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 , and it has python2.7 as default. In the terminal, i type 'python' and it automatically pulls up python2.7. I don't want that. 
from terminal I have to instead type 'python3.2' if i want to use python3.2. 
How do i change that?
Assistant: You could edit the default python path and point it to python3.2
Open up ~/.bash_profile in an editor and edit it so it looks like
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH
