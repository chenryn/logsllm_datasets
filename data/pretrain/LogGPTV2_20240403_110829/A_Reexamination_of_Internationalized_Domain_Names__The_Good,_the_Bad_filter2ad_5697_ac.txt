that malicious IDNs tend to have longer active time, which
are even close to non-IDNs (legitimate for most of them).
Finding 6. IDNs are visited less frequently than non-
IDNs, except for malicious IDNs. Illustrated in Figure 3,
query volume differs signiﬁcantly between IDNs and non-
IDNs: 88% com IDNs were queried less than 100 times, the
rate being 74% for non-IDNs under com. Again, malicious
IDNs witnessed larger trafﬁc volume, even more than non-
IDNs in average.
The observations on malicious IDNs indicate attackers
are effective in trapping visitors. As an example, we found
(xn--0wwy37b.com), an illegal Chinese gambling site
ﬂagged as malicious, received 3, 858, 932 queries, the largest
among all IDNs, and stayed active for 118 days. Meanwhile,
malicious parties often choose to register IDNs which are
highly deceptive to attract visitors. By contrast, benign IDNs
are struggling to attract visits.
Finding 7. IP addresses of IDNs are concentrated.
106, 021 IP addresses are identiﬁed from passive DNS, which
are further mapped to 43, 535 /24 network segments. We
Fig. 2: ECDF of domain active time
Fig. 3: ECDF of domain query volume
computed ECDF of IDNs over segments, as illustrated in
Figure 4, and found that 80% IDNs are hosted by servers
in 1, 000 /24 network segments. Among the top 10 network
segments hosting 24.8% IDNs, four belong to web hosting
services (e.g., Linode), four belong to parking services (e.g.,
GoDaddy parking), one belongs to Akamai and the remaining
one is a private network segment.
D. Content and Intention
To understand the motivation of registration, we performed
content analysis on IDNs, using the homepages fetched by
our web crawlers. As accurate content-based classiﬁcation
is challenging for a large volume of websites, we chose to
sample a number of IDNs (500) and manually examine their
content. We divided them into 7 general categories, as listed
in Table V. In addition, we sampled the websites of non-IDNs
and performed the same classiﬁcation.
Finding 8. Visiting an IDN leads to meaningless content
and resolving errors with much higher probabilities. We
found that over 45% of the sampled IDNs are not resolved,
while only 19% are running meaningful websites. The ratios
for non-IDNs are 15.2% and 33.6% respectively. To notice, all

IDNs in zone ﬁles have associated NS records so all resolution
errors come from name servers (e.g., DNS REFUSED error).
The large volume of resolution errors on IDNs means their
owners are not even making the right DNS conﬁguration.
When a domain is not in active use, its owner can park the
domains and gain earnings from advertisements. However, it
turns out IDN owners prefer to leave it without any mone-
tization intention. Among the IDNs with meaningful content,
most are in Japanese and Korean, implying registrants in these
countries are more serious in IDN registration and use IDN to
deliver language-speciﬁc content.
E. SSL Certiﬁcate
HTTPS is the key to secure today’s Internet trafﬁc between
users and web sites, and to mitigate the threats from eaves-
droppers. Recent study shows the adoption of HTTPS grows
steadily among reputable sites. We are interested in the trend of
HTTPS adoption in IDN domains and whether SSL certiﬁcates
are installed in the correct way. To this end, we queried for
SSL certiﬁcates from 737, 269 IDNs (50.06%) and 816, 882
non-IDNs (68.07%) which can be resolved, and downloaded
67,087 (4.55%) and 35, 028 (2.92%) certiﬁcates from IDNs
and non-IDNs for further analysis.
Finding 9. The management of SSL certiﬁcates is very
problematic among IDNs and more than 97% of them
have security issues. Considering most IDNs are inactive,
the result on SSL certiﬁcates is actually not as negative as the
ratio depicts. However, a close look at the conﬁgurations of
certiﬁcates revealed that they are oftentimes poorly installed.
In fact, 12.54%, 18.14% and 67.28% certiﬁcates are expired,
self signed and shared in an invalid way as shown in Table VI.
The analysis on non-IDNs revealed the similar issue, but the
ratio of expired certiﬁcates is higher and there are less shared
certiﬁcates. Though surprising, we found that our results in
fact resemble the prior studies in HTTPS measurement. Liang
et al. [39] studied 10,721 DNS-CDN-Enabled sites and found
68.8% websites were using invalid SSL certiﬁcates mainly
offered by CDN service providers. For the HTTPS ecosystem,
Durumeric et al. [15] showed 4.6% of all domains had in-
valid certiﬁcates. We found 4.5% (65, 713) invalid certiﬁcates
among all 1.4M IDNs. Since most of our studied IDNs and
non-IDNs are less known, this ﬁnding indicates there is still
a long way ahead for deploying SSL certiﬁcates correctly in
long-tail websites.
Next, we elaborate our observations around certiﬁcate shar-
ing. In this case, a number of websites deploy the same
SSL certiﬁcate whose owner ﬁeld is inconsistent with the

domain names of websites. This security issue broadly exists
for both IDNs (67.28%) and non-IDNs (45.47%). Table VII
presents the Common Names of top 10 certiﬁcates shared
among IDNs, and we found that most of shared certiﬁcates
belonged to domain parking and hosting services. When a
domain is parked, parking service modiﬁes the DNS response
IP to one under itself [54]. Most owners have no motivation to
do advanced conﬁguration on parked domains, like installing
their owned SSL certiﬁcates (if any), resulting in certiﬁcate
sharing. Similarly, several hosting service providers are pro-
viding shared SSL certiﬁcates, such as cafe24.com based in
Korea, which are also extensively used. Domains associated
with identical IPs are more likely to share certiﬁcates.
V. AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF IDN ABUSE
IDN abuse has been brought to discussion since the begin-
ning of IDN implementation. However, only a few incidents,
i.e., homograph attacks, have been reported so far [23, 36].
Little has been done to fully understand adversaries, including
their registration patterns and intentions behind IDN abuse. In
addition, a comprehensive analysis regarding how applications
(e.g., browsers) handle IDN abuse is also missing. We aim to
ﬁll these missing pieces in this study.
By matching 1.4 million IDNs with blacklists, we identiﬁed
6, 241 malicious IDNs. While homograph attack is a natural
way to abuse IDN and many domains in our dataset are under
this category, we discovered another category of abuse, which
exploits the semantic similarity between IDNs and brand
domains. These two attack categories are described below.
Homograph attack. Homograph attack exploits the visual
resemblance of different characters,
i.e., homoglyphs. Our
dataset of malicious IDNs contains a large number of homo-
graphic IDNs and we select 12 malicious IDNs impersonating
facebook.com as examples to highlight attackers’ registration
patterns (listed in Table VIII). In these cases, attackers replace
1 to 3 ASCII letters with characters of similar shapes from
Vietnamese, Arabic, Icelandic and Yoruba.
Semantic attack. Besides homographic domains, there are
malicious IDNs attempting to fool users using semantic sim-

TABLE VIII: Examples of malicious homographic IDNs
TABLE IX: Examples of Type-1 semantic abuse
ilarity. Such semantic-based abuse has never been reported
before. We divide IDNs of this category into two types.
In Type-1 attack, adversaries combine brand domain names
with keywords from another language to create IDNs. For
to impersonate
example, adversaries may register
Apple’s customer services. A user could be fooled when she
forgets to check SSL certiﬁcates or owner information of
the domain. In Table IX we list four other malicious IDNs
attacking Apple and iCloud. This attack vector is similar
to combosquatting attacks which combine brand names with
English keywords [30].
In Type-2 attack, IDNs are created by translating English
brand names to other languages. An example we discovered
was an IDN defrauding a Chinese company, Gree Air Condi-
tioner. Though the company has registered the English domain
name gree.com.cn long time ago, its Chinese version
was registered by attackers. Table X lists several such IDNs.
Conﬁrming whether domains are Type-2 abuse is challeng-
ing, as mapping a potential Type-2 abuse to its targeted brand
is not always feasible. In this work, we focus on homograph
attack and Type-1 attack.
VI. HOMOGRAPH ATTACK
In this section, we ﬁrst examine how latest browsers tackle
homograph attacks. Then, we propose a method to detect reg-
istered homographic IDNs and estimate their scale (including
unregistered ones).
A. Browsers
Following the homograph attack this year [23, 36], many
browsers have upgraded their policies of IDN display. As an
example, in Firefox, if all characters within one IDN label
belong to a single character set,
the IDN is displayed in
Unicode characters [42]; Chrome adopts a similar policy with
more restrictions [9]. As such, many of the homographic do-
mains we found (see Table VIII) will be rendered in Punycode
form, because each domain contains characters from at least
two character sets. Alternatively, showing Punycode under all
TABLE X: Examples of Type-2 semantic abuse
circumstances should mitigate the issue entirely, which is in
fact the default option of some browsers. Nevertheless, this
policy runs opposite to the IETF requirements [16] and we
do not recommend this solution. In the end, we want
to
understand how IDN policies are enforced by browsers and
how far it is till solving the entire problem. As such, we carried
out a survey study of a set of browsers.
Speciﬁcally, we manually tested ten widely-used browsers
on three different platforms (PC, iOS and Android). We in-
putted Unicode characters of homographic SLDs and checked
how they are displayed in regions like address bar, status
bar and title bar. Besides, we tested how IDNs under iTLDs
are supported in the same experiment settings (e.g. testing
, xn--wss800gp5g.xn--ﬁqs8s).
Our survey result is shown in Table XI. We found that
browsers treat IDNs differently. Our ﬁrst observation is that
except one browser (Sogou PC), all others could address
certain homograph attacks (examples in Table VIII). However,
their security policies are not consistent. As an example,
soso.com (all characters are from Cyrillic, with punycode
being xn--n1aa1eb.com, mimicking soso.com which ranks 96
in Alexa) bypasses the policy of Firefox as all characters are
in the same set. In the end, we found ﬁve browsers on PC
and one on Android are vulnerable. Moreover, some mobile
browsers (ﬁve browsers on iOS and three on Android) choose
to display webpage titles in address bars when visiting IDNs.
This setting is quite problematic, as adversaries can use a title
which is identical to a brand domain’s. Among all browsers,
QQ browser is particularly interesting as it redirects user
to about:blank for some IDNs (and displays Punycode for
others). The reason behind this design is unclear.
Regarding iTLD IDNs, browser policies also differ. Firefox
treats an iTLD IDN as a valid domain only if a protocol preﬁx
(e.g., http://) is present. Though a browser should handle both
Unicode and Punycode TLD based on standard, we found that
three browsers on iOS and two on Android only recognize
Unicode iTLDs. We speculate the TLD lists used by these
browsers only contain the Unicode version of iTLDs. On the
other hand, one Android browser only supports Punycode
iTLDs. Surprisingly, Baidu browser on Android does not
support iTLD at all, regardless of the format.
B. Detecting Homographic IDN
We identiﬁed some homographic IDNs and their targeted
brands through manual analysis. This approach cannot scale
on the blacklisted IDNs, not to mention the entire IDN dataset
(1.4 million). To address this problem, we developed an
approach to automatically detect homographic IDNs given a
set of brand names.
In essence, our approach leveraged the visual resemblance
between brand and homographic domain names. We ﬁrst ren-
dered the image of every IDN (1.4 million) and brand domain
(Alexa Top 1k SLDs), and then measured their pair-wise visual
resemblance. To calculate similarity between domains, we
adopted a metric called Structural Similarity (SSIM) Index,
which compares luminance, contrast and structure between
