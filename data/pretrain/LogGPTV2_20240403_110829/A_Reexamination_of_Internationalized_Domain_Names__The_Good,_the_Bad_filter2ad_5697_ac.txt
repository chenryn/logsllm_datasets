### Observations on Malicious IDNs and Their Characteristics

**Finding 6: Activity and Query Volume of IDNs**
- **Activity Duration:** Malicious IDNs tend to have a longer active time, often comparable to non-IDNs, which are mostly legitimate.
- **Query Frequency:** IDNs, in general, are visited less frequently than non-IDNs. However, malicious IDNs exhibit higher query volumes, sometimes even surpassing those of non-IDNs. As illustrated in Figure 3, 88% of .com IDNs were queried fewer than 100 times, compared to 74% for non-IDNs under the same TLD. Malicious IDNs, such as `xn--0wwy37b.com` (an illegal Chinese gambling site), received a significant number of queries (3,858,932) and remained active for 118 days.

**Finding 7: Concentration of IP Addresses**
- **IP Address Distribution:** The IP addresses associated with IDNs are highly concentrated. Out of 106,021 identified IP addresses, 43,535 /24 network segments were mapped. As shown in Figure 4, 80% of IDNs are hosted by servers within 1,000 /24 network segments. The top 10 network segments, hosting 24.8% of IDNs, include web hosting services (e.g., Linode) and parking services (e.g., GoDaddy).

### Content and Intention Analysis

**Content Analysis:**
- **Methodology:** To understand the motivations behind IDN registration, we conducted a content analysis using homepages fetched by our web crawlers. We manually examined a sample of 500 IDNs and categorized them into 7 general categories, as listed in Table V. A similar classification was performed for non-IDNs.
- **Findings:**
  - **Resolution Errors:** Over 45% of sampled IDNs were not resolved, while only 19% hosted meaningful content. For non-IDNs, these figures were 15.2% and 33.6%, respectively.
  - **Empty or Parked Domains:** Many IDNs were either empty, parked, or redirected, indicating that their owners did not intend to monetize them. Among the IDNs with meaningful content, most were in Japanese and Korean, suggesting that registrants from these countries are more serious about IDN use.

### SSL Certificate Management

**HTTPS Adoption and SSL Certificates:**
- **Adoption Rates:** We queried SSL certificates from 737,269 IDNs (50.06%) and 816,882 non-IDNs (68.07%) that could be resolved, and downloaded 67,087 (4.55%) and 35,028 (2.92%) certificates for further analysis.
- **Security Issues:**
  - **Certificate Management:** More than 97% of IDNs had security issues with their SSL certificates. Specifically, 12.54% were expired, 18.14% were self-signed, and 67.28% were shared in an invalid way (Table VI).
  - **Comparison with Non-IDNs:** Non-IDNs also exhibited similar issues, but with a higher ratio of expired certificates and fewer shared certificates. Our findings align with prior studies, such as Liang et al. [39] and Durumeric et al. [15], which highlight the challenges in deploying valid SSL certificates, especially for long-tail websites.

**Certificate Sharing:**
- **Common Names:** The Common Names of the top 10 shared certificates among IDNs (Table VII) indicate that most shared certificates belong to domain parking and hosting services. This is due to the lack of motivation among domain owners to perform advanced configurations on parked domains, leading to certificate sharing.

### Empirical Analysis of IDN Abuse

**IDN Abuse:**
- **Homograph Attacks:** These attacks exploit the visual resemblance of different characters. Our dataset includes numerous homographic IDNs, with examples impersonating `facebook.com` (Table VIII).
- **Semantic Attacks:** These attacks use semantic similarity to fool users. Type-1 attacks combine brand names with keywords from another language, while Type-2 attacks involve translating English brand names into other languages (Tables IX and X).

### Browser Handling of Homograph Attacks

**Browser Policies:**
- **Display Policies:** Most browsers have updated their policies to mitigate homograph attacks. For example, Firefox displays IDNs in Unicode if all characters belong to a single character set. However, some browsers, like Sogou PC, remain vulnerable to certain homograph attacks (Table XI).
- **iTLD Support:** Browsers differ in their support for internationalized TLDs (iTLDs). Firefox requires a protocol prefix for iTLDs, while some iOS and Android browsers only recognize Unicode iTLDs.

### Detecting Homographic IDNs

**Automated Detection:**
- **Methodology:** To scale the detection of homographic IDNs, we developed an approach that leverages visual resemblance between brand and homographic domain names. We rendered images of 1.4 million IDNs and Alexa Top 1k SLDs, then measured their pairwise visual similarity using the Structural Similarity (SSIM) Index.
