User: In case both options available: to call a command line tool with subprocess (say, hg) or to make use of native python API (say, mercurial API), is there a case where it's more favorable to use the former?
Assistant: The only way that i see myself using subprocess instead of a native python api is if some option of the program is not provided in the api.
