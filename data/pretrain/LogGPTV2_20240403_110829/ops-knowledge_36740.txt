User: How to configure network interface in Linux system?
Assistant: In the Linux system, there are many ways to configure the network interface, the most commonly used of which is to use the command line tools ifconfig and ip. 1. ifconfig command The ifconfig command is used to set or display the configuration information of the network interface, which can be used to configure IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, MAC address, etc. Example: Set IP address: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 Set subnet mask: ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0 Set MAC address: ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 Enable network interface: ifconfig eth0 up disable Network interface: ifconfig eth0 down 2. ip command The ip command is also a command line tool for configuring network interfaces, and its function is more powerful than ifconfig. Example: Set IP address: ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0 Set default gateway: ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 Set DNS server: echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf Enable network interface: ip link set eth0 up Disable the network interface: ip link set eth0 down 3. Configuration file In addition to the command line tool, you can also configure the network interface by modifying the configuration file. Commonly used configuration files are: /etc/network/interfaces /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network Different Linux distributions may use different configuration file paths and formats, which need to be determined according to specific conditions configuration.
