### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
npm overrides that work fine with npm 8.5.5, are causing an error during `npm
ci` as of npm 8.6:
    npm ERR! `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync. Please update your lock file with `npm install` before continuing.
    npm ERR! 
    npm ERR! Missing: trim-newlines@1.0.0 from lock file
After running `npm install` again (as suggested by the error message) `npm ci`
is working again, but the transient `trim-newlines` dependency version is no
longer overridden in package-lock.json.
### Expected Behavior
`npm install` with `overrides` configuration should produce a package-
lock.json that can be processed by `npm ci` and contains overridden versions.
### Steps To Reproduce
On a local development machine, create a blank project with defaults and add a
dependency with vulnerable transient dependency:
    mkdir npm-overrides-issue
    cd npm-overrides-issue
    npm init
    npm i svg2sprite-cli
-> 3 high severity vulnerabilities
add overrides configuration to mitigate transient vulnerability
      "overrides": {
        "trim-newlines": "^3.0.1"
      }
then
    npm i
    npm ci
-> still 3 high severity vulnerabilities, `ci` still works
force update of package-lock.json
    rm -rf package-lock.json node_modules
    npm i
    npm ci
-> found 0 vulnerabilities, `ci` fails with the following error
    npm ERR! `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync. Please update your lock file with `npm install` before continuing.
    npm ERR! 
    npm ERR! Missing: trim-newlines@1.0.0 from lock file
in order to check that it actually works with previous npm versions:
    npm i -g npm@8.5.5
    rm -rf package-lock.json node_modules
    npm i
    npm ci
-> found 0 vulnerabilities, `ci` works as expected
