User: You need to configure failover for a group of virtual servers to ensure business continuity. Please provide a solution based on Pacemaker and Corosync.
Assistant: The failover solution based on Pacemaker and Corosync is as follows: 1. First, install and configure Pacemaker and Corosync on each virtual server. 2. Create a virtual IP address and assign it to the master server. 3. Configure Corosync to listen to the status and IP address of each server and ensure their status is in sync. 4. Use Pacemaker to configure resources: including virtual IP addresses, data files and services. 5. Set up the monitoring node method and define the classification and level of resource faults. 6. If there is a problem with the primary server, Pacemaker will detect it and assign a virtual IP address to the backup server so that the service can be restored. 7. When the main server is available again, Pacemaker will restore the virtual IP address to the main server. This Pacemaker- and Corosync-based approach can help ensure virtual servers keep running in the event of a master server failure or other issues. This enables business continuity to be maintained and system availability to be maximized.
