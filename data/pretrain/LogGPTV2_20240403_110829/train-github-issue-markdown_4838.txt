## Summary
It would be great to have a simple way to change the field names for the
output.
## Motivation
When we define an item class we usually use Python variables for the names of
the fields.  
However in the output files we'd rather have correctly spelled headers.  
But if we use the current approach, we only have the variables names as
headers by default:

## Describe alternatives you've considered
I wondered if using an **init** function for the item class would be the
recommended way.  
Or are there other options?
