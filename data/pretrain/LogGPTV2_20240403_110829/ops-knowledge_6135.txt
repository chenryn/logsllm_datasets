User: Is there official documentation on the Python website somewhere, on how to install and run multiple versions of Python on the same machine on Linux?
I can find gazillions of blog posts and answers, but I want to know if there is a "standard" official way of doing this?
Or is this all dependent on OS?
Assistant: I think it is totally independent. Just install them, then you have the commands e.g. /usr/bin/python2.5 and /usr/bin/python2.6. Link /usr/bin/python to the one you want to use as default. 
All the libraries are in separate folders (named after the version) anyway.
If you want to compile the versions manually, this is from the readme file of the Python source code:

Installing multiple versions
On Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python
  using the same installation prefix (--prefix argument to the configure
  script) you must take care that your primary python executable is not
  overwritten by the installation of a different version.  All files and
  directories installed using "make altinstall" contain the major and minor
  version and can thus live side-by-side.  "make install" also creates
  ${prefix}/bin/python3 which refers to ${prefix}/bin/pythonX.Y.  If you intend
  to install multiple versions using the same prefix you must decide which
  version (if any) is your "primary" version.  Install that version using
  "make install".  Install all other versions using "make altinstall".
For example, if you want to install Python 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0 with 2.6 being
  the primary version, you would execute "make install" in your 2.6 build
  directory and "make altinstall" in the others.
