### 1. Introduction
#### Topics for Discussion
- **Brief Coverage of Non-RAID Systems**: Understanding the basics of non-RAID configurations.
- **Introduction to RAID**: An overview of Redundant Array of Inexpensive (or Independent) Disks.
- **RAID 0 and RAID 5**: Detailed explanations and recovery techniques.

### 2. RAID Configurations
#### RAID 0
- **Overview**: RAID 0 is a configuration that stripes data across multiple drives for improved performance but offers no redundancy.
- **How It Works**:
  - RAID 0 does not provide data protection. If one drive fails, the entire array is lost.
  - It is used primarily for speed and performance, spreading read and write cycles over two or more drives.
  - The stripe size and location can vary based on the controller and manufacturer.
  - For arrays with more than two drives, determining the correct order of drives can be challenging due to the lack of sequencing numbers.

#### RAID 5
- **Overview**: RAID 5 provides data redundancy by distributing parity data across all drives, allowing the system to continue running even if one drive fails.
- **How It Works**:
  - Parity is a formula that calculates error correction data.
  - By distributing parity across all drives, RAID 5 creates a safety net for data when a drive fails.
  - Two types of controllers are used: Host-Based (uses the computer's processor) and Discrete (has its own processor).
  - If two drives fail, the array goes down, and it becomes crucial to identify which drive to repair first.

### 3. Recovery Process
#### Assumptions
- We assume you have already repaired the damaged drive and have imaged it in some fashion. This image will be used for reassembly.

#### Steps to Rebuild RAID Arrays
1. **Repair All Necessary Bad Drives**: Ensure all drives are functional.
2. **Image the Damaged Drive(s)**: Recover as many sectors as possible.
3. **Image All Good Drives**: Create images of all functioning drives.
4. **Analyze and Re-Weave Images**: Use software to virtually reassemble the images. Test the data.
5. **Write the New Image**: Write the newly weaved image back to a hard drive to start the logical recovery process.

### 4. Special Cases
#### JBOD Drives
- **Overview**: JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks) refers to drives that are logically linked end-to-end.
- **Characteristics**:
  - No redundancy, often get very hot, and may have melted cables.
  - Some recoveries can be successful by placing the drives in a G5 and booting from a Mac external disk, even if the LaCie board is burnt out.

#### LaCie and Other JBOD Drives
- **LaCie NAS Boxes**: Specific considerations and recovery techniques for LaCie Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices.

#### Dynamic Disks
- **Overview**: Dynamic disks do not use partition tables; instead, they use LDM (Logical Disk Manager) at the end of the disk.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Uses one single partition occupying the entire disk minus one cylinder.
  - Partition table is not updated when volumes are added or deleted.
  - Recognized by data recovery software like R-Studio.

### 5. Recovery Tools and Techniques
#### RAID 0: Practical Tips
- **Identify the First Drive**: Determine the first drive in the array by checking the slice size. If the slice size is larger than 32k, the active boot partition is usually at sector 63.
- **Set Slice Size**: Set the slice size to your best guess (commonly 64k).
- **Scan for Files**: Scan for recognizable file types (JPG, JPEG, GIF, MP3s) and extract them to verify the order.

#### RAID 5: Practical Tips
- **Controller Types**: Understand the difference between Host-Based and Discrete controllers.
- **Parity Calculation**: Parity is calculated using XOR operations on the data slices.
- **Arrangements**: Different arrangements (Left Async, Left Sync, Right Async, Right Sync) affect the way data is distributed.
