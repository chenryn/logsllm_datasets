Assumptions 
•  We are assuming you have already 
done what I previously described in 
previous videos and classes to 
repair the damaged drive. 
•  You now have a running drive and 
have imaged it in some fashion and 
will use that for reassembly.

RAID Array’s 
•  Redundant  Array of (Inexpensive 
or Independent) Disks. 
•  Some arrays are not “Redundant” 
•  Different types of arrays may need 
different numbers of drives in the 
array and may give you different 
results in free space available by 
how they are setup.

JBOD Drives 
•  Means “Just a Bunch of Disks” and they are just 
linked logically together end to end. 
•  These drives usually have no fan, get very hot and 
contain several drives. Sometimes the cables are 
melted together. 
•  I have found that some recoveries that are using 
these JBOD will work once repaired, even if the 
Lacie board is burnt out, just by placing them in a 
G5 and connecting them and booting on a Mac 
external disk. This is great for when you cannot 
repair the Lacie board or power supply.

Dynamic Disks 
•  Dynamic disks do not use partition tables, 
they use LDM which is at the end of the disk 
and needs to be done backwards. It uses 
one single partition occupying the entire 
disk minus one cylinder. When volumes are 
added or deleted the partition table is not 
updated.  
•  This will be noticed right away by some 
data recovery software like R-Studio.

RAID 0: How it works 
•  RAID 0 has no redundancy for protecting 
data and if one drive fails you loose the array. 
•  IN short RAID 0 should be called AIDS.

RAID 0: How it works 
•  RAID 0 is a very simple type of raid that is 
used mainly to gain speed and performance 
by spreading your reads and write cycles over 
two drives. 
•  RAID 0 can, depending on the controller and 
the choice of the manufacture, vary the size 
and location of the strip and it is helpful to 
know the brand and type of controller.

RAID 0 strips with  
only two drives

15 
RAID 0 Two Drives + 
•  There are RAID 0 arrays with more than two 
drives, however there is no sequencing numbers 
and the order of the array is determined by the 
data’s location there is no way to determine the 
order of the drives in the array. 
•  With two drives, the array is either stored in one 
order, or the other, but if there are 4 drives in 
the array, there are at least 72 different 
combinations and no indication of what way is 
correct. This will make recovery exponentially 
difficult and in many cases a disaster. 
Forensic Data Recovery – MyHardDriveDied.com © 2009 
16 
RAID 0 
•  In most cases you can determine 
the first drive in the array, 
depending on the slice size.  
•  How? 
•  If the slice size is larger than 32k, 
at sector 63 you will see the active 
boot partition, in most cases…

RAID 0 
•  Put the first drive in the first slot of 
whatever software you are using.. 
•  Put the other drives in their slots 
•  Set your size of your slice to your 
guess…. Usually 64 is the defaults 
(unless some tech messed with it) 
•  Scan for Pictures (JPG,JPEG,GIF) or MP3s. 
•  Stop, extract, view, listen…

What to Extract 
•  Extract between the boundaries of 
the controller…if you don’t know, 
usually guess: 
» 32k 
» 64k 
» 128k 
» 256k 
» 512k 
» 1024k

RAID 5

RAID 5: How it works 
•  RAID 5 Array protects the server from “down 
time.” It will allow for a drive to fail and your 
system to continue running without the result of 
lost data.  
•  RAID 5 does this by storing parity data on all the 
hard drives. Parity is a formula that calculates error 
correction data.  
•  By distributing parity across all drives it creates a 
safety net for the data when a drive fails.

RAID 5: Controllers 
•  There are two kinds of controllers for RAID, Host 
Based and Discrete controllers. 
•  Host controllers us the processor power in your 
computer to process the calculations for the 
array. 
•  Discrete controllers have a processor that will do 
the mathematics for calculating the array values. 
A discrete controller is much faster and leaves 
your processor to do other tasks, however, they 
are much more expensive. 
•  You are going to try to do this in software!

RAID 5: How it works 
•  There have also been times where RAID 5 
arrays have failed a single drive, but no one 
noticed before a second one failed. 
•  If two drives fail and the array goes down, 
which drive do you need to repair???

RAID 5 Simplist Sample 
Forensic Data Recovery – MyHardDriveDied.com © 2009 
38 
RAID5 For Real?? 
•  Parity is calculated by XORing the 
data with the number of slices in 
the row -1. For 4 drives it looks like 
this: 
SliceA xor SliceB xor SliceC xor SliceD = Parity

Steps to rebuild RAID 5 array 
1. Repair all necessary BAD drives. 
2. Image the damaged drive(s) and recover as 
many sectors as possible. 
3. Image all the good drives. 
4. Use software to analyses and re-weave the 
images back together virtually. Test data! 
5. Write the newly weaved image back to a hard 
drive to start the logical recovery (follow the 
logical recovery section for the type of 
format).

•  Put the first drive in the first slot of 
whatever software you are using.. 
•  Put the other drives in their slots 
•  Set your size of your slice to your 
guess…. And your ARRANGMENT to 
the order.  
•  Scan for Pictures (JPG,JPEG,GIF) or MP3s. 
•  Stop, extract, view, listen…
