User: How to achieve high concurrent web application deployment?
Assistant: To achieve high-concurrency web application deployment, the following points need to be considered: 1. Horizontal expansion and vertical expansion Horizontal expansion is to add more servers to process requests, and the distribution of requests can be realized through load balancing; vertical expansion is to increase the number of servers Processing power, such as increasing CPU, memory, etc. The comprehensive use of horizontal expansion and vertical expansion can better achieve high concurrency. 2. Caching technology Using caching technology can reduce database load and improve response speed. You can use cache servers such as Redis, Memcached, etc. 3. The distributed architecture splits the application into multiple subsystems, which run on different servers. Communicate through technologies such as message queues to achieve the effect of peak shaving and valley filling. 4. Static resource deployment Static resources such as pictures, CSS, JS files, etc. can be distributed and deployed through CDN to reduce server load. 5. Containerized deployment Using containerized deployment can facilitate application deployment and expansion. Containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes can achieve high fault tolerance and high availability. 6. Database optimization The database is the bottleneck of the entire web application, using technologies such as database clustering, sub-database and sub-table can effectively improve database performance. At the same time, you can use database caching technology such as Redis to cache some data. 7. Reverse proxy Using a reverse proxy server such as Nginx can undertake a large number of static file requests and reduce the pressure on the application server. Combining the above points, high-concurrency web application deployment can be achieved.
