### Title: Black Hat EU-19: Implementing Bring Your Own Token (BYOT) to Replace Traditional Smartcards for Strong Authentication and Signing

#### Abstract
Smartcards have long been a reliable method for enabling strong authentication to enterprise networks and applications. They provide identification, authentication, and the ability to store cryptographic key information using an embedded microchip and memory. Enterprises can provision these smartcards with a digital identity, typically in the form of an X509 certificate, uniquely associated with each user. This allows for secure logon to servers and Mutual TLS Authentication to services. Traditionally, hybrid cards that combine proximity and smartcard functionalities are used, allowing users to access both physical facilities and IT resources with a single card.

However, there are several limitations and challenges associated with using a single card for both proximity and smartcard functions. Proximity cards can be pre-provisioned in bulk, as the association of user identity to the proximity ID can be done after the card is assigned. In contrast, smartcards require the X509 certificates to contain user-specific information at the time of provisioning, which can slow down the process. Additionally, issuing replacement or temporary cards for lost or misplaced cards presents further logistical challenges.

This whitepaper details the solution implemented at Cisco to address these limitations by replacing traditional hybrid smartcards with a Bring Your Own Token (BYOT) model. The BYOT solution allows users to bring their own USB tokens, compatible with Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and Chip Card Interface Device (CCID) standards, and self-provision the necessary digital identities for strong authentication, signing, and other cryptographic functions.

#### Introduction
Smartcards have been a cornerstone of enterprise security, providing robust authentication and cryptographic capabilities. However, the traditional approach of using hybrid cards for both physical access and IT authentication has several drawbacks. These include slower provisioning processes due to the need for user-specific information on smartcards and the logistical complexity of managing lost or misplaced cards.

#### The BYOT Solution
To overcome these challenges, Cisco has developed a Bring Your Own Token (BYOT) model. This innovative approach leverages USB tokens that meet PIV and CCID standards. Users can bring their own compatible tokens and self-provision the required digital identities, enabling strong authentication, signing, and other cryptographic functions.

#### Key Benefits
- **Faster Provisioning**: By allowing users to self-provide their tokens, the provisioning process is significantly streamlined.
- **Enhanced Security**: The use of personal, user-managed tokens reduces the risk of unauthorized access and simplifies the management of lost or misplaced cards.
- **Flexibility and Convenience**: Users can choose from a variety of compatible USB tokens, enhancing convenience and reducing the burden on IT support.

#### Conclusion
The implementation of the BYOT model at Cisco represents a significant advancement in enterprise security. By addressing the limitations of traditional hybrid smartcards, this solution offers a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly approach to strong authentication and cryptographic functions.
