User: How to monitor the data flow in the network? Please give examples of commonly used traffic monitoring tools.
Assistant: Network data traffic monitoring involves the following aspects: 1. Real-time monitoring of network bandwidth usage and traffic statistics (displaying data through charts, etc.). 2. Monitor the usage of various network protocols and the behavior of network applications, analyze protocols and analyze application performance. 3. Discover network problems, including network delay, packet loss and faults, etc., diagnose problems and research solutions. Some commonly used traffic monitoring tools include: 1. Wireshark: A commonly used open source network analysis tool that can capture network packets and provide in-depth analysis. 2. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol, Simple Network Management Protocol): A protocol for monitoring and managing network devices, which can obtain information about network devices and generate reports. 3. NetFlow: A traffic analysis technology that allows users to understand in real time who is connecting to and using the network and how to use the network in network traffic segmentation. 4. PRTG Network Monitor: used for real-time monitoring of network bandwidth usage, hardware device status, service environment, etc. 5. Ntop: Used to analyze network traffic and flow direction, and provide real-time monitoring of network traffic. These traffic monitoring tools can help network administrators and operation and maintenance personnel understand network performance and problems, so as to better optimize network operations and improve network reliability and security.
