User: I am making a survay website on google app engine using Python. For saving the survey form data i am using NDB Datastore. After the survey I have to import it as spreadsheet or CSV. How can i do that.
Thanks.
Assistant: You need to take a look at the google spreadsheets api, google it, try it, come back when something specific doesnt work.
Also consider using google forms instead which already do what you want (save responses to a spreadsheet)
