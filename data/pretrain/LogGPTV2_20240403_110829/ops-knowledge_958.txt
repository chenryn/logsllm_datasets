User: Configure high-availability solutions for the company's business-critical applications to ensure system reliability and stability. You need to consider multiple availability techniques such as load balancing, failover, hot backup, data replication, etc.
Assistant: First, configure load balancers for business-critical applications to ensure that requests can be distributed to different servers in the event of traffic surges, avoiding server overload, and ensuring application availability and stability. Secondly, configure the failover mechanism. When a server fails, the traffic will be automatically transferred to another standby server to ensure the continuity and availability of the system. At the same time, the hot backup technology is enabled to back up the data on the primary server to the standby server in real time to ensure data security and integrity while reducing the risk of data loss. Finally, data replication technology can be configured to store data in multiple copies on different servers to ensure system reliability and stability and avoid single point failures from affecting the entire system.
