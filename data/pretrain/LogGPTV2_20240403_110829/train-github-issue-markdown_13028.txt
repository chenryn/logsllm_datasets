  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
Eventually this is related to #9433 , but i'm not sure.
## Expected Behavior
Snapshots should succeed when nothing was changed.
## Current Behavior
Whenever introducing a new withStyles() Component or simply updating material-
ui to the latest beta our jest test fails due to things like:
    -          className="MuiTypography-root-104 MuiTypography-body1-113"
    +          className="MuiTypography-root-111 MuiTypography-body1-120"
    // or
    -        className="MuiExpansionPanelSummary-content-169"
    +        className="MuiExpansionPanelSummary-content-176"
basically the appended number changes.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Sorry I think there is no easy sandbox reproduction possible.
## Context
We switched to material-ui from our existing global-css/deterministic
className solution where we were able to easily snapshot components and check
if they were altered. Now it seems like we have to adjust our setup, but I
don't now how.
## Your Environment
Tech | Version  
---|---  
Material-UI | basically all the v1 beta branches since we started using it
(~8+)  
React | 16
