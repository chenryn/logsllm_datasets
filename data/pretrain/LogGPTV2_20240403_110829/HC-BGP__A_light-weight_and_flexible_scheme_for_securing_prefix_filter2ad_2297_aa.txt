**Abstract:**
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a fundamental component of the Internet infrastructure. However, due to the implicit trust assumption among networks, Internet routing remains vulnerable to various types of misconfigurations and attacks. One such misbehavior is prefix hijacking, where an attacker Autonomous System (AS) injects false routes into the Internet routing system, misleading the victim's traffic to the attacker AS. Previous secure routing proposals, such as S-BGP, have relied on a global public key infrastructure (PKI), which creates significant deployment burdens.

In this paper, we propose an efficient cryptographic mechanism, HC-BGP, using hash chains and regular public/private key pairs to ensure prefix ownership certificates. HC-BGP is computationally more efficient than previously proposed secure routing schemes and is also more flexible in supporting various traffic engineering goals. Our scheme can efficiently prevent common prefix hijacking attacks, including both prefix and sub-prefix hijacking attacks.

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid growth of critical applications deployed on the Internet today, including financial transactions and voice over IP, Internet security has become increasingly important. The interdomain routing protocol, BGP, plays a crucial role in the Internet infrastructure. However, due to the lack of security guarantees in its original design, BGP is vulnerable to various types of misconfigurations and attacks [5, 13].

One type of routing protocol attack with severe impact is the prefix hijacking attack, which injects and propagates false routes to the Internet, potentially causing traffic to be redirected to the attacker's networks. There are two general types of prefix hijacks [18, 4, 10]: injecting a bogus route with a false origin AS (i.e., origin AS attacks) and injecting an incorrect route with a false AS path segment but a legitimate origin AS. There has been much evidence of the former attack [6, 12], which has caused serious damage to network availability but is relatively easy to detect. However, a special type of origin AS attack, i.e., sub-prefix attack, is more difficult to detect and prevent. In such an attack, the attacker announces a more specific prefix than the original prefix, and the route to the sub-prefix is likely used by all routers due to longest prefix matching. The recent incident of YouTube's sub-prefix hijacking [16] serves as a real-world example of the severity of such attacks.

A fundamental reason for all these real-world prefix hijacking attacks is that the current BGP system lacks any secure binding between a prefix and its owner. Many secure BGP protocols have been proposed, such as S-BGP [19], SPV [11], and KC-BGP [23]. However, none of these protocols have been widely deployed, primarily due to two deployment obstacles: the lack of a global PKI infrastructure and the high computational overhead of processing BGP updates.

The seminal work in this area, S-BGP, requires two PKIs: one for address ownership attestation and one for route announcement attestation. In S-BGP, the prefix owner has an asymmetric private key for each prefix, generated by a global trust entity. Each AS along the path will verify that the prefix actually belongs to the AS with the corresponding public key. To ensure that the route cannot be tampered with by malicious ASes, each AS signs the update with its private key.

Other secure BGP works, such as SPV [11], KC-BGP [23], and path stability-based improvements [7], have focused on the performance improvement of the second phase—generating/verifying route attestation. S-BGP reduces overhead by only providing ownership authentication with a private key Authorization Certificate assigned by a global PKI.

To our best knowledge, no existing work has attempted to improve the efficiency and flexibility of the first phase—certifying prefix origin/ownership, which is also critical to the efficient operation of any secure BGP protocol. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme based on hash chains and regular public/private key pairs of neighboring routers, overcoming deployment hurdles in providing prefix origin/ownership attestation. HC-BGP is a complementary effort to all above proposals in the second phase.

The key idea of HC-BGP is inspired by an empirical study we conducted to understand the most common routing dynamics. By analyzing three months of routing updates archived in RouteViews from 21 vantage points, we observed that most routing updates do not involve origin AS changes. To optimize for the common case, we propose to use the one-way hash chain mechanism to secure the prefix ownership in a lightweight fashion. HC-BGP guarantees that the permission to announce any sub-prefix is granted by the owner of the cover-prefix. Thus, our scheme not only secures the relevant prefix but also secures its sub-prefix space, effectively defending against stealthy sub-prefix hijacking attacks.
