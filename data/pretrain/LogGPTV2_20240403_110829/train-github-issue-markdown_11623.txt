I'm currently using **babelify** to transform my source code + global shimming
**babel-core/browser-polyfill.js** through a vendor file.
I noticed redefinitions of _createClass [et al] and the docs mentioned to use
`{ optional: 'runtime' }`, but this has the unfortunate side effect of also
including **regenerator/core-js** , extending the dev build time.
It would be nice if I can define `{ optional: 'runtime.helpers' }` and have it
include only the helpers.
