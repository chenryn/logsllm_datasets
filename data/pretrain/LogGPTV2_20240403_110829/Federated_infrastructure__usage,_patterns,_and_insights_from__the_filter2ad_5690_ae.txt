Figure 12e shows the final result of this model. The green re-
gions come from the revised convex hull model. The yellow areas
come from the added radial coverage. The almost-invisible red trim
around the yellow regions comes from the RSSI coverage. Zoomed
out, it is difficult to see the impact of RSSI coverage. Figure 14 shows
the distribution of RSSIs reported by witnesses from 2021-05-18 to
2021-05-22. At the median -108 dBm, the RSSI step adds only an
additional 20 m of coverage range. With this coverage model, the
network achieves 3.3032% coverage of the contiguous US.
8.2.2 Measured Coverage. We run two real-world experiments,
with results shown in Figure 15a and Figure 15b, to observe the em-
pirical coverage of hotspots. we plan neighborhood walks through
areas with varying hotspot density. While walking, we carry an
edge device running the counter app described previously. We add
GPS coordinates and a timestamp to the app payload. Packets are
also logged to an SD card when sent, to create a record which we
can compare to what was received by the cloud. Overall, these walks
have a Packet Reception Rate (PRR) of 72.9% and 77.6% respectively.
We investigate whether the HIP 15 promise holds and explains
when and where losses occur. Predicting reception when within
300 m of a hotspot is accurate 55.5% of the time, while predicting
no reception outside of the radius is accurate for 79.6% of packets.
The LoRa protocol includes an acknowledgment mechanism,
where an edge device can request an ACK response from its owning
router. At the edge device, failure to receive an ACK is recorded as
a NACK. Note that the LoRa PHY is asymmetric; said simply, uplink
(edge→gateway) is easier than downlink (gateway→edge) [21].
This means the cloud may record data which the edge device thinks
it needs to retransmit. We run statistics regarding ACK and NACK

9 DISCUSSION
9.1 Legal Considerations
Several of the challenges faced by Helium, such as the high pro-
portion of relayed nodes and the unreliability of hotspot network
connections likely stem from hotspots using residential ISPs for
backhaul. However, many of these same ISPs are also looking into,
or actively rolling out, competing IoT networks [3, 22]. Helium
hotspots may not even be permitted on these networks. For in-
stance, Spectrum, the top Helium ISP, may not allow users to host
hotspots according to its terms of service:
Because the Service is for residential use only, any use of the
service for non-residential purposes is not permitted and may result
in reduction in service, suspension, or termination at the sole
discretion of Spectrum. Non-residential purposes include, without
limitation, the following: l. Running any type of server on the
system that is not consistent with personal, residential use. This
includes but is not limited to FTP, IRC, SMTP, POP, HTTP, SOCS, SQUID,
NTP, DNS or any multi-user forums.
Helium hotspots are not hard to detect. They attempt to use a
unique port, 44158, and report their IPs to a public database. If
Spectrum were to flip the switch and enforce these provisions, at
least 17% of the US hotspots would fall offline.
9.2 Looking Beyond LoRa
The initial Helium network targets an unfilled, emerging niche,
namely low-power IoT devices. These devices are particularly well-
suited to Helium’s micro-transaction model, which enables sig-
nificantly lower barrier to entry than offerings from traditional
service providers. The notion of using residential Internet infras-
tructure to provide coverage is not new: many service providers
today use home routers as APs for wide-area WiFi coverage for
their subscribers. MachineQ proposes putting LoRa radios in Com-
cast Customer Premises Equipment to provide coverage (although
without paying home users for this geospatial access privilege).
Early on, when competing only in the nascent IoT space, Helium
was perhaps not yet a threat. Now, Helium has announced intent
to compete in more traditional communication markets, namely
5G. It will be interesting to see how Helium’s meta-infrastructure
suppliers respond to this potential business threat and how con-
sumers respond to the opportunity provided by Helium to partake
in the profits of the wireless infrastructure ecosystem.
10 CONCLUSION
The Helium network continues to expand rapidly to provide broad
connectivity for commodity edge devices. The growth of the net-
work is in part because Helium is providing well-designed infras-
tructure and incentives. Many individuals are readily purchasing
and deploying hotspots to mine HNT—the Helium cryptocurrency—
and the incentives drive deployment of base stations that can pro-
vide new coverage. While the uncontrolled and unplanned deploy-
ment of hotspots allows for efficient growth, it does not necessarily
ensure reliable or predictable coverage. Helium continues to pro-
pose new policies that attempt to improve coverage and implicitly
improve reliability. However, Helium must enforce these policies
to ensure network robustness. Also, while Helium network has
grown, it still mostly relies on a small number of residential ISPs
to backhaul traffic. If those ISPs disallow Helium hotspots on their
network, Helium’s viability will be in question.

validity as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. We found that there were
no false ACK messages and many false NACK messages—packets
received on the cloud but recorded as NACKs by the edge device.
There are many factors unknown to us regarding the reliability
and coverage of the Helium network. We have only conducted a
basic experiment to explore network reliability. Future analyses
should deploy their own routers, own more gateways to monitor
traffic, and extract more diagnostics from the edge device LoRa
stack to enable rich root cause analysis.

may be attempting to manipulate or cheat the network, we do not
engage in any of these activities ourselves.
All of the analysis in this paper is performed on publicly acces-
sible data. That said, many users and hotspot operators may not
be directly aware of the volume or level of detail that is publicly
available. We attempt to minimize explicit identification of any
individual users in a way that may publicly identify them, or make
them easily and immediately available to undue public scrutiny,
with the exception of companies who have explicitly and publicly
announced their relationship with the Helium corporation and/or
Helium network. Where we do perform explicit analysis of public
entities, we attempt to show how such mapping of user or operator
identity to blockchain transactions might be done by a technically
competent user without providing a step-by-step guide.
The nature of the Helium design is such that hotspot owners
reveal their location, very often personal residences, to within a
few meters. While hotspot owners implicitly consent to the sharing
of this information by asserting the hotspot location on the public
blockchain, it is unlikely that any one user expects to be singled
out in a case study. For this reason, where we do discuss individual
device owners, we either omit identifying details unnecessary to
the analysis at hand or make use of an appropriate pseudonym.

The research group has purchased, deployed, and operates two
Helium hotspots. The first hotspot was deployed in winter of 2020,
and as a consequence, the research group has acquired several
thousand HNT through normal hotspot operations. These tokens
have only been used to purchase DC in support of other research
activities.

Figure 16: Annotated view of the Helium Explorer (https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots/hex/8829a41a95fffff). The sensor trans-
mitting packets for the second experiment in Section 8.1 is located at the red dot. The sensor is unencumbered, outdoors, and placed near
no metal on a plastic, elevated platform at approximately head-height on a second story balcony in a mixed residential neighborhood
immediately surrounded by two-story structures but with three- to five-story structures on the block. The clearest line-of-sight is to the
north and east where the balcony faces alleys. Spot-checks on the diagnostics available in the Helium Console reveal that at least six different
hotspots ferry data from this sensor over the course of the experiment. Receiving hotspots report an RSSI ranging from -120 to -55 (n.b. the
-55 is our owned hotspot, located in the same structure as the sensor; remarkably, it is rarely chosen by the Console, perhaps because this
hotspot is on a NAT’d residential connection and is relayed). The best third-party hotspot reports RSSI values around -90.
