User: I am on a Raspberry Pi, and by default the following symbolic links were created in /usr/bin:

/usr/bin/python -> /usr/bin/python2.7
/usr/bin/python2 -> /usr/bin/python2.7
/usr/bin/python3 -> /usr/bin/python3.2

Most of my work is done in Python 3, so I decided to recreate /usr/bin/python to point to /usr/bin/python3.2 instead. Does this have any negative consequences when I install packages or run pip? Are there utilities that depend on the alias python in the search path and end up doing the wrong things?
Assistant: Yes, there are many applications and scripts that is written for python 2, and they usually come pre-installed in your linux distribution. Those applications expect python binary to be version 2. And they will most likely break if you force them to run on python 3.
