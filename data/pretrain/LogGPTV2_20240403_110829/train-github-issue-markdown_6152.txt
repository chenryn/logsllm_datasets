Requiring the user to ensure that only one instance of celerybeat exists
across their cluster creates a substantial implementation burden (either
creating a single point-of-failure or encouraging users to roll their own
distributed mutex).
celerybeat should either provide a mechanism to prevent inadvertent
concurrency, or the documentation should suggest a best-practice approach.
