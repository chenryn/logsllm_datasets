services for electronic commerce and electronic business. WSDL does not, how-
ever, support the specification of processes composed of basic Web services nor
it envision the use of semantics.

Allinall,thereare few commercial products availablethat havesuccessfully
implemented a semantic layer alongside robust a Web services infrastructure,
this despite significant industrial support which exists for standards such as
WSDL, BPEL, and UDDI. As has been mentioned, there are two primary con-
siderations for semantics with Web services - the process layer and the data
layer. Most enterprisevendorshaveindeedrecognizedtheimportanceandvalue
of semantic metadata for each area, but tend to implement solutions in propri-
etary and brittle ways; using their own metadata formats for internal semantic
reconciliation.
With regard to the process and orchestration semantics, many vendors seem
to be taking a "wait-and-see" approach while the emerging standards converge.
OWL-S, SWWS/WSML, and BPEL each have important strengths to add to
anoverarchingsemanticWebservicescapability.LeadershipfromDERIandthe
W3C have each expressed a strong interest in converging the best of each spec-
ification - vendors will no doubt wait for this alignment prior to implementing
either on their own.
The hesitation shared by most commercial vendors will not be shared by
many industrial research groups - IBM, HP, France Telecom, and Fujitsu have
all applied semantics to Web services for innovative, discovery-driven use cases.
Incontrastto"negotiation-style"semanticWebservices,thereareotherswho
take a "query-driven" approach. In fact, some commercial vendors have begun
implementingsemanticlayersontopofWebservicesasawaytoissuequeriesto
them instead of writing more brittle contracts. Annotating Web services using
the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) can make it simpler evolve services
in dynamic businesses. To do this, modeling tools map ontologies to Web ser-
vice WSDL interfaces and a runtime inference engine issues query plans to the
underlyingservices.Thisstyleofsemanticqueryisclearlydistinctfromprocess-
centric approaches, but both approaches help automate meaningful access to
overly abundant corporate information.
4 Common Ground for Future Work
For Web services to become a platform for semantic service oriented comput-
ing, academic and industrial researchers will need to create terminologies, tech-
nologies, and products that enable sophisticated solution for the advertisement,
discovery, selection, composition, and execution of Web services.
Recently, the Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI), an initiative of aca-
demic and industrial researchers has been composed to create infrastructure
that combines Semantic Web and Web services to enable the automation in all
aspects of Web services. In addition to providing further evolution of OWL-S,
SWSI will also be a forum for working towards convergence of OWL-S with the

products of the SWWS/WSMO [25]/WSML [24]/WSMX [26] research effort,
whichsuppliesWebserviceproviderswithacoresetofconstructsfordescribing
thepropertiesoftheirWebservicesincomputer-interpretableform.OWL-Swill
facilitatetheautomationofWebservicetasks,includingautomatedWebservice
discovery, composition, and execution. The current version of OWL-S builds on
the Ontology Web Language (OWL) recommendation produced by the Web-
Ontology Working Group at the World Wide Web Consortium. OWL-S is the
first well-researched Web Services Ontology, and has numerous users from the
academia.
WSMO is a complete ontology for the definition of Semantic Web Services.
It follows the WSMF as a vision of Semantic Web Services. WSMO itself is
definedusinganontologylanguagebasedonF-Logic[12].Itcontainsallconcepts
required for Semantic Web Services: Ontology, Mediator, Goal, Web Service
Interface. The WSML is a family of languages that allow Semantic Web service
designers to define Semantic Web services in a formal language. The WSMX
provides a standard architecture for the execution of Semantic Web services.
Itsarchitectureiscomponent-basedandonepossibleimplementationofService-
oriented Architectures. WSMX itself has execution semantics.
The largest patch of common research ground that industry and academia
havetoshareissimple,orrather,makingsemanticWebservicessimpler.Aswith

good tools. One day analysts will be dragging-and-dropping process diagrams
and point-and-clicking ontology mappings. Until then, researchers in industry
and academia would be well served to examine modeling heuristics to lower
barriers for widespread adoption.
The more likely path of common ground will likely be to reach agreement
on ontologies for service descriptions, processes, and security. At an even more
fundamentallevel,researcherswillhavetomeasurethestrengthsandlimitations

the infusion of semantics will alter today’s conceptions of the service-oriented
architecture paradigm.
5 Summary
Many believe that a new Web will emerge in the next few years, based on the
large-scale research and development ongoing on the Semantic Web and Web
services. The intersection of these two, Semantic Web services, may prove to be
even more significant. Academia has mainly approached this area from the Se-
manticWebside,whileindustryisbeginningtoconsideritsimportancefromthe
Webservicesside.Academiastarteddevelopingsemantic-basedWebserviceslan-
guages,suchasDAML-S(nowOWL-S),toenrichthedescriptionofWebservices
to facilitate greater automation. The idea was to make explicit the representa-
tion of the semantics underlying data, services, and other resources, providing

frastructure that could allow software applications to be accessed and executed
via the Web based on the idea of Web services. Their efforts resulted in impor-

(Fig. 1). This paper has highlighted some of the contributions of both industry
and academia and discussed recent cooperative efforts such as SWSI. Seman-
tic Web Service technology’s potential impact makes it essential for further and
expanding cooperative efforts to be pursued in the future.
