**Title: Black Hat USA 2018: Lessons and Lulz - The 4th Annual Black Hat USA NOC Report**

The Black Hat Network Operations Center (NOC) team is back with another year of insightful and often surprising statistics. We will be sharing the data that continues to both baffle and entertain us year after year. In this report, we will detail the tools and techniques we use to set up, stabilize, and secure the network, as well as the improvements and changes we have implemented over the past year to enhance our operations.

Additionally, we will highlight some of the more humorous and peculiar network activities observed during the event. These anecdotes not only provide a lighter side to our work but also offer valuable insights into the behavior of security professionals on an open WiFi network. Spoiler alert: Our conduct, even as security experts, often leaves much to be desired.
