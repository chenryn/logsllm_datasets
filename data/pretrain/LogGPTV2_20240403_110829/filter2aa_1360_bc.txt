The results identify over twenty websites that include these terms. Within those sites are dozens of archived 
copies of each. This data represents decades of content at your fingertips. Much of it is offline and unavailable 
on the current public internet. Many domains have completely shut down. Furthermore, websites that I own 
appear within the results, even though I have specifically blocked archiving them through a configuration file 
on my server. You would not find these by searching the domains direcdy through the Wayback Machine. This 
is a reminder that we should check all available resources before completing our investigations.
Google and Bing tend to have very recent results which often appear identical to the live view. However, the 
Yandex option from a week prior is more likely to contain modified content. You can often locate a cached 
version of a page that is older than the Yandex version on Baidu.

Finally, it is important to acknowledge that these resources can be beneficial when everything on a website 
appears to be present and unaltered. While caches work well on websites that have been removed and are 
completely empty, they also can tell a different story about websites that appear normal. Any time that I find a 
website, profile, or blog of interest, I immediately look at caches hoping to identify changes in content. These 
minor alterations can be ven' important. They highlight information that was meant to be deleted forever. These 
details can be the vital piece of your investigation puzzle. Most people have no idea that this technique exists.
Not ever}’ piece of information that will be useful to you will be obtained by standard searches within English 
websites. Your target may either be from another country or have associates and affiliations in another country. 
While Google and Bing try to pick up on this, the technolog}’ is not perfect. Google has a search site and 
algorithm that change by location. For example, google.fr presents the French search page for Google. While 
this may produce the same overall results, they are usually in a different order than on google.com. Google no 
longer maintains a page with links to each international version of its search, but I have a preferred method.

This site can also be helpful when demonstrating to someone the importance of searching targets through 
multiple countries.
I am often asked during training which of the sendees I use during investigations. My answer is all of them. This 
is important for two reasons. The obvious benefit is that you will receive four unique translations that will be 
very similar. The minor variations may be important, especially when translating Tweets and other shortened 
messages that may not be grammatically correct in any language. The second reason is to show due diligence 
during my investigation. 1 always want to go above and beyond what is required. Translating a foreign web page 
through four different services emphasizes my desire to conduct an unbiased investigation.
There are dozens of additional online translation tools available. Almost all of them allow translation of a small 
amount of text at a time. Some use either the Google or Bing translation service. One last online translation tool 
worth mentioning is PROMT Online Translator. It is unique from the dozens of other options in that it allows 
translation of entire websites similar to Google and Bing. This service provides an independent translation and 
can be considered a third source.
There is one last feature regarding foreign language searching that 1 have found useful. Google's Input Tools 
allow you to type in any language you choose. Upon navigating to the above website, choose the language of 
your target search. In Figure 9.09,1 have chosen Arabic as the language and typed "Online Investigation" on a 
standard English keyboard. The result is how that text might appear in traditional Arabic letters. I have had die 
most success with this technique on Twitter. When supplying any search term on Twitter, the results are filtered 
by the presence of the keywords entered and only in the language provided. Searching "Online Investigation" 
on Twitter only provides results that have that exact spelling in English characters. However, searching the 
Arabic output provides Tweets that include the Arabic spelling of the selected words. This technique is extremely
While smaller than Google or Bing, this may be the most accurate translator service I have found. The pag 
appears and functions identical to the previous options, but the results may be substantially different
A few years after Google introduced free translation services, Bing created their own product. At first glance, it 
looks like a replica of Google's offering. However, Bing's translations are usually slightly different than Google's 
results. Similar to Google, you can also type or paste an entire foreign website to conduct a translation o^ 
everything on the target page.
Many websites exist in non-English languages. As internet enthusiasts, we tend to focus on sites within our 
home area. There is a wealth of information out there on sites hosted in other countries which are presented in 
oilier languages. Google Translator will take text from any site or document and translate the text to a variety 
of languages. Usually, the service will automatically identify the language of the copied and pasted text Selecting 
the desired output will provide the translation. Alternatively, you can translate an entire website in one click 
which will give a native view of the layout of the site. Instead of copying individual text to the search box, type 
or paste in the exact URL (address) of the website you want translated. Clicking the "Translate" button will load 
a new page of the site, which will be translated to English. This translation is rarely, if ever, perfect. However, it 
should give you an idea of the content presented on the page. This will also work on social network sites such 
as Twitter and Instagram.

This paid service provides the world's largest collection of newspaper archives. The high-resolution PDF scans 
of entire daily newspapers range in date from die 1800's until present. The first four editions of this book 
explained a method of using the Google Site operator and cached results to obtain practically any page of this 
newspaper collection without paying or subscribing. These vulnerabilities have all been patched and none of 
those techniques work today. Fortunately, Newspaper Archive still offers a 14-day free trial with unlimited access 
to every’ archive. While multiple trials can be obtained, each require a unique credit card number and email 
address. Many libraries have asked this sendee to scan their entire microfilm archives and make them freely 
available online. You will not find any mention of this free alternative on their home page, but a bit of searching 
will guide you to the right place. The following search on Google identifies hundreds of public libraries that pay 
for your access to their archives.
On 12/13/2017,1 navigated to ncw’spaperarchive.com/advancedsearch/ and conducted an advanced search for 
anyone named Michael Williams from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Newspaper Archive presented several results from 
the Cedar Rapids Gazette. Clicking on any of these results prompted me to create an account and forced me to
This can be an amazing resource of information about a target. In the past, if someone relocated to a new 
geographical area, he or she could leave the past behind and start over. Today, that is difficult. Google's News 
Archive is continually adding content from both online archives and digitized content from their News Archive 
Partner Program. Sources include newspapers from large cities, small towns, and anything in between. The link 
referenced above will allow for a detailed search of a target's name with filters including dates, language, and 
specific publication. In order to display this menu, click on the down arrow to the right of the search box. This 
can quickly identify’ some history of a target such as previous living locations, family members through obituaries, 
and associates through events, awards, or organizations.
The first part of the search tells Google to only look at the website newspaperarchive.com. The second part 
mandates that the exact phrase "This archive is hosted by" appears in the result. The final piece isolates only the 
newspaper collections that are available for free and without a credit card. This identifies the landing pages of 
the various libraries that have made their collections freely available. While you will still be required to register 
through the service, payment is not required for these collections. Consider the following usage that will likely 
present you with free views of Newspaper Archive whenever you need them.
The previous option focused solely on digital content, such as your local newspaper website. Google's 
Newspaper archive possesses content from printed newspapers. A.11 results on this site consist of high-resolution 
scanned newspaper pages. In my experience, this collection is not as extensive as the next option discussed. 
However, it is definitely worth a look, and will likely continue to grow.

enter a valid credit card number to proceed. I could not create an account from any of the pages without 
providing payment. Instead, I conducted the following Google search.
The first result was a direct connection to crpubliclibrary.newspaperarchivc.com. Clicking this link presented a 
page dedicated to searching over 40 newspapers within the Cedar Rapids and Des Moines areas. In the upper 
right corner was a link tided "Create Free Account". I clicked this link and provided generic details and a 
throwaway email address. The membership choices now include a completely free option, which will only allow 
access to the Iowa newspapers. After creating my free online account, I returned to the portal at 
crpubliclibraty.newspaperarchive.com and repeated the search of my target. Every link allowed me full 
unrestricted access to the high-resolution images.
If the search operators discussed in this chapter seem too technical, Google offers an advanced search page that 
simplifies the process. Navigating to the above website will present the same options in a web page that are 
possible by typing out the operators. This will help you get familiar with the options, but it will be beneficial to 
understand the operators for later use. The Advanced Search page will allow you to specify a phrase for which 
you are searching, just like the quotes in a search will allow. The site and filetype operators used earlier can be 
achieved by entering the desired filters on this page. It should be noted that the file type option on this page is 
limited to popular file types, where the filetype operator can handle many other file extensions.

Note that the search features on all of these options are mediochre at best. Always consider a Google search, 
such as siteistparchive "michael bazzell".
While still logged in to this account, I navigated to delawarecolib.newspaperarchive.com, the direct page 
associated with the Delaware County Library (which I found through the original Google search in this section). 
I was not authorized to view this newspaper collection. However, after clicking "Create Free Account" on this 
page, 1 entered the same data as previously provided to the Iowa newspaper. After verifying my email address, 
1 was allowed immediate access to this series of newspapers.
This technique will not obtain access to every collection on Newspaper Archive. However, it will provide a 
surprising amount of free access to huge collections internationally. During an hour of downtime, I created a 
free account on every library collection I could locate, using the same credentials on each. I can now log in to 
my single Newspaper Archive account and navigate the site from any page. When I reach a newspaper of interest 
after a search, I will be given full access if it is within a free collection. This is all thanks to the local libraries that 
have paid this site to give free access to the public. If the free trial of Newspaper Archive or the free library 
collections do not offer enough content, consider the following options.

Google isolates some search results into specialized smaller search engines. Each of these focuses on a unique 
type of internet search. The following engines will likely give you results that you will not find during a standard 
Google or Bing search. While some results from these unique searches will appear within standard Google 
results, the majority will be hidden from the main page.
Google Blogs (google.com)
Keyword Tool displays autocomplete data from Google, Bing, YouTube, and the App Store. You have likely 
noticed that Google quickly offers suggestions as you type in your search. This is called autocomplete. If I were 
to type "macb" into Google, it would prompt me to choose from the most popular searches when people typed 
those letters. This information may lead you to new terms to search in reference to your investigation. The 
advantage of Keyword Tool over Google is that Google only provides the five most popular entries. Keyword 
Tool provides the ten most popular entries. Additionally, you can choose different countries to isolate popular 
terms. You can also see results from similar searches that Google does not display.
Bing does not technically provide an advanced search page similar to Google's. However, since Yahoo uses 
Bing's search, you can use Yahoo's advanced search page as a replacement This page will allow you to easily 
create a search that filters by individual terms, exact phrases, omitted terms, specific domains, file formats, and 
languages.

Real World Application: 1 have successfully used this technique during the investigation of many businesses. 
I was once asked by a medium-sized business to investigate reports of a faulty product that they had recently 
recalled. They wanted to see customer complaints. After searching the typical review websites, I conducted a 
search with Keyword Tool. 1 discovered that the 9th most popular search involving this specific product name 
included a term that was a misspelling of the product name. It was different enough in spelling that my searches 
were missing this content. Knowing this information, I was able to locate more relevant data for the client

This is considered a meta-crawler, as it presents results from Google, Bing, and others. It often gets dismissed 
as another comparison search site, but there are many other advantages to using this service. First, conducting 
a search will provide results from the main search engines, but will remove duplicate entries. This alone is a 
quick way to conduct your due-diligence by checking Google and Bing. Next, the top row of options will allow 
you to repeat this redundancy-reducing option by checking results on Images, News, and Videos sections. Next 
to each result on any search page is a "cached” link. Instead of opening the Google or Bing cache, clicking this 
will open the cached page of the target website through the Wayback Machine. Finally, a "proxied" option next 
to each result will connect you to the target website through a proxy sendee provided by Searx. This is basically 
a layer of privacy preventing the website owner from collecting data about you, such as your IP address. 
Technically, Searx.me opened the target site, and their data would be tracked instead of yours. There are ways 
for adversaries to bypass this "anonymity", but it is decent protection for most sites.
Google and Bing are great, but they do not do it all. There will always be a nc
