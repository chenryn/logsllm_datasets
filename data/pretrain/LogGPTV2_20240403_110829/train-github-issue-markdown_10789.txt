A recent change to the DateTimeToStringTransformer (`b20c5ca`) now causes time
values with AM/PM timestamps (H:i A) to fail in validation This is because the
change now expects all time values to be in H:i:s datetime format whereas
previously the system was more compatible with different formats.
Works: 14:03:07
Fails: 02:03:07 PM
This specifically causes errors when using a datetime entity type.
It seems that there are two possible ways to fix this issue. The first is to
allow the DateTimeType to take in format as an option so users can specify
different time formats instead of defaulting to H:i:s in all cases. The other
would be to modify the DateTimeToStringTransformer so it is more resistant to
failures like this, but could possibly cause the initial fix to break.
Is there any other way to bypass this issue?
