### Bug report
**Bug summary**
Definitely a low-priority bug, but at some figure sizes, there seems to be an
issue with the colorbar not being drawn at the correct position in some
backends (seems like PDF and SVG are affected, but not Agg).
The colorbar "fill" (the actual colored bit) will not line up with the box
that contains it (the black marker edge that makes the rectangle that is
filled by the color bar, see below). Seems like some sort of rounding issue.
I have a more "dramatic" example, but still need to distill it to a minimum
working example, as it is a plot of proprietary data.
**Code for reproduction**
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.cm
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(2, 1.5))
    plt.plot()
    sm = matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable()
    sm.set_array([])
    plt.colorbar(sm)
    plt.savefig('/home/bbeltr1/Downloads/test.svg')
    plt.savefig('/home/bbeltr1/Downloads/test.pdf')
    plt.savefig('/home/bbeltr1/Downloads/test.png', dpi=800)
**Actual outcome**
