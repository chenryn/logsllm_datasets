**Abstract:**
Despite nearly two decades of IPv6 development and significant efforts to promote its adoption, the global share of IPv6 traffic remains low. The research community has focused on characterizing IPv6 adoption, particularly whether ISPs and content providers enable IPv6 connectivity. However, little is known about the actual usage of available IPv6 connectivity and the factors that determine whether data is exchanged over IPv4 or IPv6. To address this, we leverage a vantage point within a dual-stack residential broadband network to study interactions between applications, devices, equipment, and services, and how these interactions influence the IPv6 traffic share. We also discuss potential scenarios that dual-stack ISPs and content providers may face during the transition to IPv6.

## 1. Introduction

The widely deployed version 4 of the Internet Protocol (IPv4) faces a fundamental resource scarcity problem: the exhaustion of globally unique IP address space. This scarcity has forced some ISPs to use Network Address Translation (NAT) for large customer segments or to purchase remaining free IPv4 address blocks on the market. IPv6, with its vastly larger address space, was intended to replace IPv4 before the scarcity issue became critical. Despite initiatives by Internet governing bodies to promote IPv6 deployment, the transition has been slow and challenging in production environments. There is no clear consensus on when IPv6 will become the preferred interconnectivity option on the Internet. While Google reports an IPv6 connectivity adoption rate of up to 16% for end hosts as of January 2017, the IPv6 traffic share at major Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) remains between 1-2%. This disparity between connectivity and traffic share is not only a cause for concern but also indicates a different interconnection structure among ISPs. The provider hierarchy in the IPv6 Internet shows distinct properties compared to that of IPv4, with one ISP offering free IPv6 tunnels having the largest customer cone in the IPv6 Internet, while Tier-1 ISPs with worldwide backbones are less prominent.

We argue that increasing IPv6 traffic shares will provide incentives for ISPs to provision proper IPv6 infrastructure, establish genuine interconnectivity, and ultimately make IPv6 the primary protocol on the Internet. For data to be exchanged over IPv6, all components along the path from source to destination must fully support IPv6. This includes:
- End-user devices and operating systems supporting IPv6.
- Applications making proper use of available connectivity options.
- Customer premises equipment (CPEs) supporting and providing IPv6 to the home network.
- ISPs assigning IPv6 to subscribers' CPEs.
- Content providers enabling their services over IPv6.

Even if all components support IPv6, modern applications use "happy eyeballs" to choose between IPv4 and IPv6 based on current network conditions. To investigate the reasons for the limited increase in IPv6 traffic, we study this problem from the perspective of 12,900 subscribers of a dual-stack ISP. This vantage point allows us to analyze the interactions between applications, devices, equipment, and services, and how they influence the share of IPv6 traffic. Our main findings are:
- Many subscribers cannot use IPv6 due to limitations in CPEs, even though the ISP supports IPv6 connectivity.
- IPv6-ready services often exchange significant traffic over IPv4 due to fallback mechanisms and IPv4-only devices.
- Dual-stack networks could see a rapid increase in IPv6 traffic if a few major service providers enable IPv6 for high-traffic domains.

## 2. Related Work

The research community has called for data to track the evolution of IPv6. Studies have reported the IPv6 traffic share at various vantage points in the Internet. In 2008, most IPv6 traffic at a tier-1 ISP in the US was DNS and ICMP. Initiatives like the "World IPv6 Day" in 2011 increased IPv6 traffic, but by 2013, the share of IPv6 traffic at European IXPs and 260 network providers was still below 1%. Despite this, IPv6 traffic experiences a many-fold increase each year. This has led to studies on dual-stack networking performance, active measurements of the Internet's IPv6 infrastructure, and analyses of the AS-level topology. A large body of literature has focused on measuring IPv6 adoption among ISPs and service providers. Some works seek to understand the root causes of slow IPv6 adoption, finding slower adoption at the edge compared to core networks and poor IPv6 quality in the early days. Today, the IPv6 control and data planes are almost on par with IPv4, and both control planes show signs of convergence. Standardization bodies have addressed IPv6-related aspects, including fallback mechanisms for dual-stack applications (e.g., "happy eyeballs"). We complement this work with a passive measurement study at a dual-stack ISP to shed light on why some data exchanges occur over IPv4 instead of IPv6.

## 3. Methodology

Our study focuses on the traffic in a residential broadband network of a dual-stack ISP, where IPv4 and IPv6 traffic coexist. We first need to discover the connectivity options of the subscribers (client side) and the service providers (server side). With this information, we can study which traffic is exchanged over which protocol and why.

### 3.1 Measuring IPv6 Connectivity

#### Subscribers (Client Side)
Broadband network providers typically use Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) to assign IP addresses to subscribers. RADIUS supports the delegation of IPv6 addresses to subscribers. If the CPE receives an IPv6 prefix assignment, the subscriber has IPv6 connectivity from the ISP. Traffic statistics later tell us whether the subscriber's devices actually use the assigned IPv6 prefix.

Not all devices within home networks support IPv6, so raw traffic statistics are necessary but not sufficient to infer IPv6 capability. We use AAAA DNS requests as an indicator for the presence of IPv6-speaking devices. Most dual-stack applications follow the "happy-eyeballs" standard, issuing A and AAAA DNS requests. If the service is available over IPv6, the device attempts to connect simultaneously to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. Some implementations introduce a preference towards IPv6, such as Apple devices, which issue an IPv6 connection immediately after a successful AAAA request if the A response did not arrive or if historical RTT data suggests a difference > 25 ms. Given that most DNS clients issue AAAA requests first, some dual-stack devices do not always attempt a connection over both IPv4 and IPv6, even if they issue requests for both RRs.

Many resolver libraries avoid suppressing AAAA requests if there is no global IPv6 connectivity but just link-local, i.e., within the home network. This information helps identify CPEs that offer link-local IPv6 connectivity even if the ISP does not provide IPv6 connectivity to them.

#### Services (Server Side)
In this paper, we use the term "service" to refer to content and functionality available on the Internet via a Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). If the network infrastructure hosting a service supports IPv6, a service provider can make its services available over IPv6 by updating the corresponding DNS AAAA and PTR resource records. We analyze DNS traffic to infer if a service is IPv6-ready by looking for non-empty AAAA responses in our traces. We complement passive data with active measurements, i.e., we actively request AAAA records for FQDNs found in our trace.

### 3.2 From IPv6 Connectivity to IPv6 Usage

With the connectivity options of subscribers and services (IPv4 and/or IPv6) known, we proceed to study the exchanged traffic. We first need to annotate each flow in our trace with the respective subscriber and service.

#### Matching Flows to Names
One of the building blocks for our methodology is the ability to associate DNS requests issued by an IP address with the network flows it generates, i.e., reproducing the mapping between FQDNs and server IPs for each subscriber. For dual-stack networks, the IP addresses of the flows and those of the DNS traffic are not necessarily the same. Therefore, we keep track of the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to each subscriber. We update this mapping according to the TTL values of the DNS response RRs, using a conservative approach and strictly adhering to the TTL expiration values. We do not consider negatively cached responses, as some resolvers do not respect the SOA record, which can lead to mis-attributions.

#### Annotating Flows
We annotate each flow with the following information:
- Whether the ISP has delegated an IPv6 prefix to the subscriber's CPE.
- The FQDN associated with the flow, where possible.
- If the subscriber issued A and/or AAAA DNS requests.
- After collecting the trace, we extend this annotation with:
  - Whether the subscriber makes use of the assigned IPv6 prefix.
  - The connectivity options for the FQDN, i.e., whether the service is available over IPv4 and/or IPv6.
