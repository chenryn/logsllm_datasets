User:  company has multiple offices, each with its own network. In order to improve the company's information security, it is necessary to isolate the networks of each office so that direct communication between different networks cannot be performed. Please provide a network isolation solution suitable for this scenario.
Assistant: A network isolation solution suitable for this scenario is to use virtual local area network (VLAN) technology to create an independent VLAN for each office, and configure corresponding ports on the switch to connect the devices in each office to their respective VLANs . In addition, security devices such as firewalls can be used to implement isolation at the network level and limit communication between different VLANs. Through this solution, the isolation between office networks can be realized and the company's information security can be improved.
