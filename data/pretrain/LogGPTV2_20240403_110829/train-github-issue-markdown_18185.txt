Having animated route transitions would be nice, as this is one of the many
benefits through client-side routing. Doing so should be left up to the user
in my opinion (some people prefer CSS transitions over more fine-grained
control with `react-motion` etc). As I understand it, one would need to modify
the top-level App component.
The client entry file seems to look for a globally assigned
`__NEXT_DATA__.app` variable but I can't find any documentation on that.
