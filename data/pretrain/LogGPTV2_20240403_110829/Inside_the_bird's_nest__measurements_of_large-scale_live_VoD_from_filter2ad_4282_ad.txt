### Correlation Analysis of Top-10 Videos During Rush Hours

To investigate whether the top-5 videos for a specific event were correlated, we extended our analysis to other rush hour periods. We selected the top-10 most accessed videos during each rush hour and checked if they were related. For this, we defined a "related" video as one that pertains to the same sporting event, including the actual competition, prize ceremony, reports, and interviews. This definition might underestimate the correlation as it does not account for latent semantic relationships.

- **Correlation Set (CS(v))**: The set of related videos for video \( v \) in the top-10 set.
- **\(\hat{v}\)**: The video with the largest correlation set in the rush hour.
- **RelCS max**: The relative size of the largest correlation set, calculated as \( \frac{CS(\hat{v})}{10} \).
- **RelAcc max**: The relative contribution of accesses from the largest correlation set, calculated as \( \frac{\sum_{v \in CS(\hat{v})} Acc(v)}{\sum_{v \in Top10} Acc(v)} \), where \( Acc(v) \) is the number of accesses for video \( v \) during the rush hour.

**Figures 16(a) and 16(b)** show the RelCS max and RelAcc max for Soc and Oﬀ respectively. On August 13 (Soc) and August 8, 9, 13, 16 (Oﬀ), all top-10 videos in each rush hour were correlated, confirming these events as flash crowds. For Oﬀ, 11 out of 17 days had RelCS max greater than 50%, and 7 out of 17 days had RelAcc max greater than 70%. Similarly, for Soc, 8 out of 17 days had RelCS max greater than 50%, and 7 out of 17 days had RelAcc max greater than 70%.

### Example: Men’s 100m Final

The men’s 100m final on August 16 (Soc) was a significant event, with Usain Bolt setting a new world record. This event triggered a large number of accesses for the preliminary rounds, which had been published over 24 hours earlier. These videos also attracted flash crowds, as shown in **Figure 17**.

### Impact of Publish Time

We analyzed the press conference following Liu Xiang's withdrawal on August 18 (Oﬀ). Even as the press conference was ongoing, videos were being created and published. The earliest video, released at 12:35:44 pm, had the highest peak access rate (over 200 accesses per minute). Subsequent videos, released later, had lower peak access rates. This suggests that early release attracts more traffic, making it prudent for VoD systems to defer releasing new content during overload situations.

### Implications of Flash Crowd Analysis

1. **High Volume of Requests**: Flash crowds bring a large volume of requests, which are hard to forecast. Content providers can satisfy users by pushing related content to different edge servers.
2. **Early Release Attracts More Traffic**: Early release of content during live events attracts more traffic, indicating the importance of timely content delivery.

### Impact of Presentation Models

#### Access Concentration

- **Time-to-Peak**: The time elapsed between the first access and the peak access rate.
- **80% Percentile Period**: The time taken for a video to reach 80% of its total accesses.

**Table 5** compares these values for different flash-crowd phenomena. Soc brings faster access and more concentrated accesses compared to Oﬀ, as shown in **Figure 19**.

#### Video Popularity

Soc has a more skewed distribution, with the top-5 videos contributing 29% of accesses on average compared to 18% for Oﬀ, as shown in **Figure 20**.

#### Effect of Pre-Video Advertisements

Pre-video advertisements did not significantly affect user interest in Oﬀ and Soc, but had a non-trivial impact on Synd, with 2.5% of users leaving within 1 second, as shown in **Figure 21**.

### Summary

- **Flash Crowds**: Bring high volumes of requests and are best managed by providing related content.
- **Publish Time**: Early release of content attracts more traffic.
- **Presentation Models**: Soc brings more concentrated and popular content, while pre-video advertisements have a minimal impact on user interest in Oﬀ and Soc but a significant impact on Synd.
