Table 4: Speciﬁc events in the Olympics that triggered large ﬂash crowds
Intrigued by the fact that the top-5 videos for this par-
ticular event were correlated, we proceed to see if similar
correlations appeared in the remaining rush hour periods as
well. We pick out the top-10 videos with the most accesses
in each rush hour and check if these were related as well.
To deﬁne if two videos are “related” we need to understand
hidden semantic relationships between videos. We make a
simplifying assumption and deﬁne a narrower relationship.
Videos that pertained to the same “sporting event” in some
way: the actual competition event, prize ceremony, reports,
and interviews are labeled as “related”. (This could be un-
derestimating the correlation since we do not look for latent
semantic relationships. We present a case study on semantic
relationships later.) We identify such correlations by manu-
ally inspecting the videos in these top-10 sets.
We take the top-10 videos for the rush hour. For each
video, we ﬁnd other videos in this set that are related (as de-
ﬁned above). Let CS (v) denote the correlation set for video
v in the top-10 set. Let ˆv denote the video with the largest
correlation set in this rush hour. To understand how corre-
lated the top-10 videos are, we look at two measures: (1) The
relative size of the largest correlation set, RelCS max = CS (ˆv)
(cid:80)
10 ,
(cid:80)
and (2) The relative contribution of accesses from this
v∈CS(ˆv) Acc(v)
largest correlation set RelAccmax =
v∈Top10 Acc(v) , where
Acc(v) is the number of accesses for video v during the rush
hour.
Figure 16(a) and Figure 16(b) show the RelCS max and
RelAccmax for Soc and Oﬀ respectively. We see that on Aug
13 (Soc) and Aug 8, 9, 13, 16 (Oﬀ ) the top 10 videos of each
rush hour are all correlated. This further corroborates that
these events were ﬂash crowds – a large number of accesses
are triggered by the same event. For Oﬀ , 11 out of 17
days exhibits strong correlation at rush hour with RelCS max
greater than 50%. Similarly, 8 out of 17 days for Soc have
RelCS max greater than 50%. In other words, the set of top-
10 videos were strongly related. Further, in both Oﬀ and
Soc, 7 out of 17 days have RelAccmax greater than 70%; i.e.,
the accesses contributed by the correlated set dominate the
total number of accesses.
As mentioned earlier, our deﬁnition of “related” videos is
quite narrow. However, we do observe some cases where
the ﬂash crowd had other semantically related videos. (Un-
fortunately, these are harder to quantify.) However, as an
example, we consider the rush hour with second largest pro-
portion of accesses in Soc (22:00 on August 16, in Table 4).
This event was the ﬁnal of the men’s 100 meters (in which
Usain Bolt set a new world record, and needless to say, won
in style with a fair distance to spare!). This event triggered
a large number of accesses for the preliminary rounds of the
100m event that occurred earlier. The access patterns for
these videos is shown in Figure 17. Videos 1 and 2 are for the
qualifying stage and had been published over 24 hours ear-
lier. However these videos also attracted ﬂash crowds along
with the ﬂash crowd for video 3 (the actual ﬁnal race).
5.3 Does Publish Time Matter?
Given the real-time, event-driven nature of live VoD, we
want to understand if the access pattern has any relationship
with the publish time. To examine this relation, we analyze
the rush hour with the most number of accesses in Oﬀ . This
event was the press conference held after Liu Xiang withdrew
from the games. Even as the press conference was going on,
videos were being created and published. We select four
videos from this rush hour which pertain to the same event.
Figure 18 shows the number of accesses per minute as a
function of time (speciﬁed relative to the ﬁrst access time).
The earliest video was ﬁrst accessed at 12:35:44 pm that day.
At the time this video was released, the press conference
had not ended. The number of accesses increases sharply as
soon as the video was released. Among the four videos, this
earliest video has the largest peak access rate (more than
200 accesses per minute). Compared to other videos, the
ﬁrst video also has the sharpest increase, i.e., for the access
rate to reach the peak value. We refer the time duration
between the ﬁrst access to the time when the access rate
reaches the maximum as the time-to-peak. The next two
videos have their ﬁrst access at 12:55:49 pm and 13:04:36.
The peak access rates of these two videos are 50% lower
than the earliest video. The last video is ﬁrst accessed at
14:24:24. Although it is actually the most complete version
compared to the others, its peak access rate is the lowest.
Note that this series of videos is slightly diﬀerent from
the last section. In the previous set, the key event was video
3, when the Chinese gymnasts won the gold medal – this
was the video with the largest volume in the ﬂash crowd.
However, in the case of the press conference, the actual event
(Liu Xiang’s withdrawal) occurred much earlier, so the start
of the press conference (video 1) was the key event in the
series.
In both cases, the appearance of a ﬂash crowd is
directly related to the release time of the most anticipated
video. Further, in this case, the sooner a video was released,
its chances of resulting in a ﬂash crowd were greater.

5.4 Implications of Flash Crowd Analysis
1. It is clear that ﬂash crowds bring a huge volume of re-
quests. On one hand, such events are hard to forecast,
and it is diﬃcult for service providers to anticipate
them. On the other hand, since these ﬂash crowds in-
volve several related videos, users can be satisﬁed by
providing related videos – either earlier time segments
of the same event or other semantically linked videos –
even if the newest video is not immediately accessible.
Thus, a content provider can push such related content
to diﬀerent edge servers during such ﬂash crowds.
2. The live, real-time nature of the event suggests that
early release attracts more traﬃc. Thus, it might be
prudent for the VoD system to defer releasing new
content during overload situations.

IMPACT OF PRESENTATION MODELS
In this section, we analyze the impact of diﬀerent presen-
tation models. Speciﬁcally, we try to understand if there
were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the three presentation
models in terms of content popularity, ﬂash-crowd behav-
iors, and access patterns. We also measure the impact of
pre-video advertisements on user interest.

for the press conference videos following Liu Xiang’s
withdrawal on Aug 18
6.1 Access Concentration
We deﬁne the time-to-peak for a ﬂash crowd as the time
elapsed between the time a video was ﬁrst accessed to
the time the access rate (measured in number of accesses
per minute) reaches its peak value. Table 5 compares the
time-to-peak values for the diﬀerent ﬂash-crowd phenomena
shown in Table 4. We see that Soc brings much faster ac-
cess (i.e., shorter time-to-peak) value. Reﬂecting back on
the rush hour graph (Figure 9), we see that the rush hour
for Oﬀ typically lags Soc by one hour – this is a result of
the faster accesses brought by Soc.
We also compare the 80% percentile period. This is de-
ﬁned as the length of the time taken for a video to reach
80% of its total accesses. Figure 19 shows the CDF of 80%
percentile period for Soc and Oﬀ for the 200 most popular
videos. It takes around 8,000 minutes for 80% of videos to
reach their 80% percentile in Oﬀ , while it takes only 1,200
minutes in Soc.
In other words, Soc brings more concen-
trated accesses to its videos.

6.2 Video Popularity
We already saw that video popularity exhibits a Pareto-
like principle. To understand if there is a signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence between presentation models, we analyze the contri-
bution of the top-5 videos per day to the total number of
accesses. Figure 20 shows that overall Soc has a more skewed
distribution – the top-5 videos contribute 29% of accesses on
average compared to 18% for Oﬀ . We also see similar eﬀects
for the top-10% and top-20% videos (Figure 10).
6.3 Effect of Pre-Video Advertisements
To examine if pre-video advertisements aﬀected user in-
terest, we identify connections that last less than 30s for
Soc, Oﬀ , and Synd . (Oﬀ and Synd used two advertisement
segments per video which were either 5 seconds or 15 sec-
onds. Soc used no embedded advertising.) Figure 21 shows
the fraction of connections as a function of how long the
users’ stayed online. A very small time (less than 5 sec-
onds) indicates that the user lost interest and quit viewing
the video. Even though Oﬀ used embedded advertisements,
these do not aﬀect user interest signiﬁcantly and the behav-
ior is similar to Soc which had no advertisements. However,
the advertisements have a non-trivial impact on Synd ; 2.5%
of users leave within 1 second and average user attrition rate
is 1% (up from 0.5% for Oﬀ and Soc). Oﬀ and Soc both
delivered popular videos in near real-time. User interest in
