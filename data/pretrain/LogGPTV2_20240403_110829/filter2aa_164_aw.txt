### Establishing a Secure Connection with Your Raspberry Pi and Hamachi VPN

#### Introduction
When you use a public, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, your device (laptop, smartphone, or any other internet-connected device) is vulnerable to security risks. This setup often involves connecting to the internet over an insecure medium, which can expose your data to potential threats.

#### Securing Your Internet Access
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Imagine that the icon represents your target website. You may be concerned about sending login credentials over an unsecured network, or you might face restrictions from your internet service provider (ISP) that block access to certain sites.
   
2. **The Solution:**
   - To address these concerns, connect your device to both a configured Hamachi Virtual Private Network (VPN) and a Raspberry Pi proxy server. The Raspberry Pi, being a member of your internal Local Area Network (LAN) and the Hamachi VPN, provides secure remote access to internal network resources. Additionally, it masks your point of origin on the internet, making it appear as if you are connecting to your Raspberry Pi rather than the target website.

### Building Your Raspberry Pi VPN Gateway

#### Getting Started
- **Good News:** LogMeIn offers Hamachi for free for up to five hosts. For this configuration, you need two members: your Raspberry Pi and your desktop computer.
- **Step 1: Register for Hamachi:**
  - Visit the Hamachi website and register a free user account: [http://is.gd/Njxokw](http://is.gd/Njxokw). Your credentials will consist of an email address and a password.
  - **Note:** Hamachi not only serves as a platform for web proxy services but also allows you to securely connect to your home network from anywhere in the world. All VPN traffic is tunneled over standard web ports, eliminating the need for firewall exceptions or other internet access filters.

- **Step 2: Download and Install the Hamachi Client:**
  - Visit [http://is.gd/ruIvfl](http://is.gd/ruIvfl) to download the Hamachi client. LogMeIn supports major platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android.
  - **Tip:** While you can create and manage VPNs using the Hamachi desktop client, the web portal offers more flexibility.

#### Creating Your Hamachi VPN
1. **Log In to the Web Portal:**
   - Go to [https://secure.logmein.com](https://secure.logmein.com) and log in with your account email and password.
   
2. **Create a New Network:**
   - From the left-hand navigation menu, click "Networks."
   - Click "Add Network" and provide a name and optional description for your new VPN.
   - Select the Mesh network type, which allows you to connect and interact with all devices on your home or personal network.
   - For more details, refer to the Hamachi user guide available at [http://is.gd/tbNsMs](http://is.gd/tbNsMs).

3. **Configure Security Options:**
   - Leave the default settings, which require administrative approval for new join requests. Optionally, add a password for enhanced security.
   - Proceed with the Free subscription level and click "Continue."

4. **View Your New Network:**
   - In the LogMeIn web console, navigate to the "My Networks" node to see all details of your new private network.

#### Connecting to Your Hamachi VPN from Your Desktop Computer
1. **Start the Hamachi Client:**
   - Launch the Hamachi client and click the "Power On" button.
   - Provide a meaningful name (Hamachi ID) for your client computer.

2. **Join the Existing Network:**
   - Enter the nine-digit Network ID and optional password. You can find the Network ID in the web portal.
   - Submit a request for membership, and log in to the web portal to approve the request.

3. **Control Access:**
   - Right-click the network name in the Hamachi client and select "Go Offline" or "Go Online" as needed.

#### Installing the Hamachi Client on Your Raspberry Pi
1. **Establish an SSH Session:**
   - Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH and run the Bash shell as root:
     ```bash
     sudo bash
     ```

2. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - Install the Linux Standard Base (LSB) core libraries:
     ```bash
     apt-get install -y --fix-missing lsb-core
     ```

3. **Install the Hamachi Client:**
   - Download and install the latest version of the Hamachi client for ARM:
     ```bash
     wget https://secure.logmein.com/labs/logmein-hamachi-2.1.0.101-armel.tgz
     tar -zxvf logmein-hamachi-2.1.0.101-armel.tgz
     cd logmein-hamachi-2.1.0.101-armel
     ./install.sh
     ```

4. **Start the Hamachi Service:**
   - Start the Hamachi daemon:
     ```bash
     /etc/init.d/logmein-hamachi start
     ```

5. **Configure the Raspberry Pi:**
   - Log in to the Hamachi network, bind it to your LogMeIn account, and set a nickname:
     ```bash
     hamachi login
     hamachi attach
     hamachi set-nick raspi-proxy
     ```

6. **Approve the Join Request:**
   - From your desktop workstation, approve the network join request from the web console.

7. **Add the Raspberry Pi to the Hamachi VPN:**
   - Navigate to the "My Networks" page and add your Raspberry Pi to the Hamachi VPN you created earlier.

### Building Your Raspberry Pi Proxy Server

#### Introduction
A proxy server acts as an intermediary for web requests, providing confidentiality and potentially boosting browsing speed through caching. In this chapter, we use Privoxy, a fast, easy-to-configure, and flexible non-caching HTTP proxy.

#### Installing and Configuring Privoxy on Your Raspberry Pi
1. **Establish an SSH Session:**
   - Connect to your Raspberry Pi and switch to the root user context:
     ```bash
     sudo bash
     ```

2. **Install Privoxy:**
   - Download and install Privoxy from the default repositories:
     ```bash
     apt-get install -y privoxy
     ```

3. **Edit the Configuration File:**
   - Open the Privoxy configuration file:
     ```bash
     nano /etc/privoxy/config
     ```
   - Search for `listen-address` and edit the line to include your Raspberry Pi’s Hamachi IP address:
     ```plaintext
     listen-address 25.x.y.z:8118
     ```
   - Save the file and restart the Privoxy service:
     ```bash
     service privoxy restart
     ```

### Testing the Configuration
1. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Ensure your Hamachi network is active and your Raspberry Pi is visible in the Hamachi Control Panel.
   - Open your web browser and navigate to [http://privoxy.org/config](http://privoxy.org/config). The page should indicate that Privoxy is not being used.

2. **Check Your Public IP Address:**
   - Visit [http://is.gd/23sxDf](http://is.gd/23sxDf) to verify your system’s public IP address and geolocation.

3. **Configure Your Browser to Use the Proxy:**
   - Follow the instructions for your specific browser to configure it to use the Raspberry Pi’s Hamachi IP address and port 8118 as the proxy server.

4. **Recheck Your IP Address:**
   - After configuring the proxy, revisit the IP Info DB website. Your IP address and geolocation should now reflect your home network where the Raspberry Pi is located.

### Building a Raspberry Pi Tor Proxy
- **Introduction to Tor:**
  - The Tor network provides excellent privacy by routing traffic through a series of distributed routers, none of which has knowledge of the complete end-to-end path.
  - The exit node is the most vulnerable point, but with proper configuration and good web browsing hygiene, your data remains secure.

- **Advantages of Using Tor:**
  - Your source IP address and geolocation are obfuscated.
  - All data transmitted within the Tor network is encrypted, though unencrypted data entering the network remains so upon exiting.

By following these steps, you can establish a secure and private connection to the internet using your Raspberry Pi and Hamachi VPN.
