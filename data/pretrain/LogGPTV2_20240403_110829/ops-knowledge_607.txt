User: How to set up the time synchronization service of the Linux system and perform test verification? Please provide configuration method and verification steps.
Assistant: 1. Configure the time synchronization service of the Linux system Step 1: Install the NTP (Network Time Protocol) service In the Linux system, the NTP service is the most commonly used time synchronization service, which can be used to synchronize the system time with the standard time on the Internet. Before installing the NTP service, make sure the system is connected to the Internet. Enter the following command in the terminal to install the NTP service: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ntp Step 2: Configure the NTP service After the installation is complete, you need to configure the NTP service. Edit the /etc/ntp.conf file and add the following to the end of the file: server ntp.ubuntu.com server pool.ntp.org iburst driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift Among them, server specifies the time to be synchronized The server address, driftfile specifies a file used to store the precision of the system clock. After saving the file, restart the NTP service: sudo service ntp restart 2. Perform test verification Step 1: Check the system time Enter the following command in the terminal to view the current system time: date If the system time has been synchronized, the correct date and time will be displayed . Step 2: Synchronize the time manually You can manually synchronize the time to verify whether the time synchronization service is working properly. Enter the following command in the terminal to manually synchronize the time: sudo ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org After executing this command, the system time will be automatically adjusted. If the command is executed successfully, a successful synchronization message will be displayed in the terminal. Step 3: Regularly check the time synchronization service The NTP service will perform time synchronization at regular intervals by default. You can use the following command to verify whether the NTP service is working properly: sudo ntpq -p If the command is executed successfully, an output similar to the following format will be displayed: remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter =========================================== ================================= *time.nist.gov .ACTS. 1 u 2 64 37 0.544 -0.014 0.179 +ntp1 .jst.mfeed 133.243.238.164 2 u 4 64 37 39.124 1.307 0.227 -ntp2.jst.mfeed 133.243.238.243 2 u 3 64 37 39.109 -0.562 0.249 -ntp3.jst.m feed 133.243.238.253 2 u 2 64 37 38.960 6.494 0.186 +jp.ntp.t.winse 64.71.153.3 3 u 1 64 37 71.678 4.165 0.391 Among them, remote specifies the address of the time server, and refid specifies the source of the time server. When the offset and jitter values are both 0, it means time synchronization The service works fine. The above is the configuration method and test verification steps of the Linux system time synchronization service.
