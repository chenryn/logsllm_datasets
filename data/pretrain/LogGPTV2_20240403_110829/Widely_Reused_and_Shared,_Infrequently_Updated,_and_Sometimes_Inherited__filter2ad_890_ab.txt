explorations. First, users may not be attentive to how
their PIN management behaviour varies across di(cid:29)erent
assets. Therefore, we chose to conduct semi-structured
interviews, which allowed participants to speak openly
about their PIN management experiences. This format also
provides us with quantitative data, as well as enabled us
to ask clarifying and follow-up questions in cases where
more detail is needed for qualitative analysis.
Second, collecting user-selected PINs, as used to access
a wide range of assets, can quickly become impractical due
to the many-to-many mapping between PINs that users em-
ploy and the di(cid:29)erent asset categories. Such a study, while
valuable, would be incredibly time consuming and perhaps
an error-prone task. Using semi-structured interviews al-
lows us to perform exploratory analysis on the topic with
respect to the types of assets protected by PINs and to in-
vestigate usage strategies. The (cid:27)ndings would provide a
greater awareness of exact PINs used in each asset class.
In developing our survey instrument, we initially con-
ducted a pilot study (n = 4) with participants from the (cid:27)rst
author’s department. These participants were invited to a
lab where they undertook a structured survey containing
questions related to their demographics, their self-reported
pro(cid:27)ciency with technology and computer security, and
whom they lived with (see Appendix A.1 for details). We
then asked participants to enumerate all the PINs that they
use, and then for each PIN, we inquired about selection
(when and how they went about choosing it), resources
it protects and the perceived sensitivity of each resource.
We then asked about the frequency of PIN entry, others
whom they shared that PIN with, and the perceived trust
in those individuals. We also asked about any attacks
that had been encountered and their recourse. Finally, we
asked participants questions applicable to all categories,
including sharing across categories, and PIN management
after they moved on from a relationship where they had
shared a PIN with another individual.
During the pilot, participants had to respond to the same
set of questions for up to seven PINs. As a result, they found
the survey instrument to be cumbersome, as some of the
questions felt unnecessarily repetitive. We addressed this
by redesigning our survey across four sections: a section
that contained questions that were independent of any as-
set category or were pertaining to all asset categories; and
three sections that contained the same set of questions for
each of the three asset categories. This enabled us to collect
qualitative data e(cid:29)ectively for each PIN category without
fatiguing the participants.
From the pilot study, we also noted that users were using
multiple PINs in each category (e.g., multiple PINs for
multiple banking cards). In the updated survey, while we
collected information on how many PINs participants used
for each category and across how many assets, we asked
participants to respond to our category-speci(cid:27)c questions
(i.e., PIN choice sharing, reuse, and security-related as-
pects) for the most used PIN in each category. While this
design choice may have resulted in losing some valuable
information, it also supported our objective of collecting
high-quality data without losing participants’ interest due
to unnecessary repetition.
The redesigned survey was conducted with a new group

of pilot participants (n = 4). All participants completed the
surveys within an hour, a more acceptable time frame. The
researchers examined the data and found that the catego-
rization of questions across di(cid:29)erent categories provided
more meaningful insights into participants’ behaviour re-
garding the PIN lifecycle. Therefore, this improved survey
was employed for our main study (also provided in Ap-
pendix A.2).
Methodology We received approval from our ethics
board for this study. We recruited participants from a local
classi(cid:27)ed ad portal, (cid:30)yers posted around the local area, and
word-of-mouth advertising. Participants were o(cid:29)ered $25
for their participation in an hour-long study conducted on
campus at the University of Guelph. They were informed
prior to participating in the interview, that they must not
reveal their actual PINs to the researchers.
Before the interview, we described digital asset PINs as
the PINs that are used to unlock digital devices or authenti-
cate to mobile and web apps. Digital assets enumerated to
participants included smartphones, laptops, personal com-
puters, online accounts, voicemail, gaming consoles, apps,
smart watches, thermostats, and other smart home devices.
While PINs to digital home locks or banking web or mobile
apps could be classi(cid:27)ed as digital PINs, we asked partici-
pants to categorize those as physical or (cid:27)nancial PINs, re-
spectively. Financial asset PINs were described as the PINs
that controlled access to (cid:27)nancial assets, including ATM
cards, loyalty cards, and banking websites or apps. Phys-
ical asset PINs were described as the PINs that controlled
access to physical assets, including electronic home locks,
home security systems, garage door openers, cars, and bike
or gym locks.

During the semi-structured interview, the researcher
(cid:27)rst asked about the number of PINs participants used and
the assets protected by these PINs. The researcher also
reminded participants about several assets that could be
PIN protected to ensure that participants did not forget
any PINs. The researcher then explained each of the three
categories of PINs, and provided examples of assets for
each category. The researcher then asked category-speci(cid:27)c
and category-independent semi-structured interview ques-
tions.

4 Results
We now present our (cid:27)ndings. For test statistics, a Pearson’s
Chi-Squared test was used to compare categorical data, and
a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to
compare Likert scale responses between asset groups [30].
For all tests, a <0.05 critical value was used for statisti-
category, we applied Bonferroni correction to-values and
set the signi(cid:27)cance cut-o(cid:29) at/, where is the number
cal signi(cid:27)cance. For multiple comparisons of the same data
of multiple comparisons [24]. When reporting quotes from
participants to represent a theme, we identify the number
of participants who expressed that code and provide a rep-
resentative quote.

4.1 PIN Usage
In total, 140 PINs were reportedly being used by our
participants, and per participant, the average number of
PINs in use is 4, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of
15. These PINs are used to control access to 231 assets. As
presented in Table 2, 94 (41%) assets are digital, 84 (36%)
are (cid:27)nancial, and 53 (23%) are physical.
Among the digital assets, participants primarily reported
PINs for securing their smartphones, voicemail accounts,
and laptops/PCs (32, 22, and 17 digital assets, respectively).
For (cid:27)nancial assets, participants reported using PINs for
banking (debit or credit cards) and other loyalty cards (66
and 16 (cid:27)nancial assets, respectively). Among physical as-
sets, participants reported using PINs for keypad entry sys-
tems for home (or security systems), garage doors, and dial
locks for bikes/gym lockers (17, 19, and 11, respectively).
Participants were asked to rate how important the se-
curity of their assets is to them on a scale of 1–5 (5 being
the most important) for each of the asset types. The me-
dian response was 5 all asset types. The mean responses
were 4.31, 4.71 and 4.23 for digital, (cid:27)nancial and physical
assets, respectively. A Kruskal-Wallis test indicated no sig-
ni(cid:27)cant di(cid:29)erences between asset groups for the security
rating ((2)=4.98,=0.08).
The self-reported daily usage of PINs across each cate-
gory is provided in Table 3. Participants authenticated to
their digital assets more frequently than (cid:27)nancial or physi-
cal assets, 30/32 (94%) “Daily” or “Multiple times a day” vs.
14/34 (41%) and 12/25 (48%, respectively. While more partic-
ipants were using their PIN-protected (cid:27)nancial assets (e.g.,
bank cards) daily, they reported using more usable methods
of payment, such as NFC-based tap-to-pay.
We asked participants to report the current PIN that they
have been using for the longest period of time within each
category. Figure 1 shows the responses from all participants
as well as responses grouped into two age groups—18–35
years (n = 16) and 36+ years (n = 19). For all participants,
the median age of PINs for digital, (cid:27)nancial, and physical
assets was 5, 8.5, and 4.5 years, respectively. Six partici-
pants reported never changing a PIN across any category
since con(cid:27)guring those. As the sampled PIN ages were not
distributed normally, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-
way analysis of variance test was used to compare PIN ages
between groups. However, this test provided no evidence

6.58,<0.05).
Table 4 shows that 9/49 (18%) PIN updates across asset
types were due to the compromise of PINs. In Section 4.6,
we report our (cid:27)ndings that the majority of PIN compro-
mises do not result in a PIN update. Another 15/49 (31%)
PIN updates were performed as a preventive security
measure. The reasons for the update were similar to the
following:
“Yes, changed it because felt it was good to change. Because
its more secure to change it from time to time.” (P16)
Five of the seven participants who updated PINs of their
(cid:27)nancial asset did so to change the default PIN that was
set by the bank for security reasons.
12/49 (24%) of PIN updates were due to memorabil-
ity reasons—either motivated by participants’ decision to
choose easy to remember PINs or as a result of forgetting a
PIN.
“I have been using this PIN for various things for 30 years.
[I] set my devices to the same PIN when I get them.” (P31)
For digital assets, 7/22 (32%) PIN updates were a result of a
device (smartphone) upgrade. The reason for PIN updates
due to device upgrades are explored below. Other less com-
mon reasons included policy requirements and impulsive
updates.
Participants were asked to describe the strategy they
used to pick the new PIN for each of the PIN update
events, and we furthered queried participants about di(cid:29)er-
ent events that led to PIN updates. The codi(cid:27)ed responses
are reported in Figure 3, which shows that the most popular
strategies for selecting a new PIN are choosing an easy to
remember number or a signi(cid:27)cant number, such as a date.
Other popular strategies included using numbers that rep-
resented a word or using a pattern on the keypad. 17/49
(35%) PIN update strategies were simply reported as an easy
to remember PIN. Since patterns or reused PINs are easy to
remember, it is not clear how many of these participants
were choosing patterns or reusing other PINs. We discov-
ered this confound during our analysis; therefore, for digi-
tal assets, we were unable to collect data on what prompted
participants to update PINs when they acquired a new de-
vice. However, the update strategies show that users em-
ployed approaches that result in better memorability (easy
to remember or represents a signi(cid:27)cant number or word).
The two cases for physical asset upgrades are reported for
situations when participants moved to a new place and up-
dated PINs for digital locks.
It is interesting to note that signi(cid:27)cant numbers and key-
pad patterns were popular PIN update strategies despite
the reason for update—whether it was security or memo-
rability. Insecure PIN selection strategies were prevalent in
high-risk scenarios:
“Yes, suspect my ex-girlfriend had it. I think she saw me
enter it in and I changed it after that. I added two digits to
