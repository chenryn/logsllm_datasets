Abstract
Wireless networks are being integrated into the modern
automobile. The security and privacy implications of
such in-car networks, however, have are not well under-
stood as their transmissions propagate beyond the con-
(cid:2)nes of a car’s body. To understand the risks associated
with these wireless systems, this paper presents a privacy
and security evaluation of wireless Tire Pressure Moni-
toring Systems using both laboratory experiments with
isolated tire pressure sensor modules and experiments
with a complete vehicle system. We show that eaves-
dropping is easily possible at a distance of roughly 40m
from a passing vehicle. Further, reverse-engineering of
the underlying protocols revealed static 32 bit identi-
(cid:2)ers and that messages can be easily triggered remotely,
which raises privacy concerns as vehicles can be tracked
through these identi(cid:2)ers. Further, current protocols do
not employ authentication and vehicle implementations
do not perform basic input validation, thereby allowing
for remote spoo(cid:2)ng of sensor messages. We validated
this experimentally by triggering tire pressure warning
messages in a moving vehicle from a customized soft-
ware radio attack platform located in a nearby vehicle.
Finally, the paper concludes with a set of recommenda-
tions for improving the privacy and security of tire pres-
sure monitoring systems and other forthcoming in-car
wireless sensor networks.
1 Introduction
The quest for increased safety and ef(cid:2)ciency of au-
tomotive transportation system is leading car makers
to integrate wireless communication systems into au-
tomobiles. While vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-
infrastructure systems [22] have received much attention,
the (cid:2)rst wireless network installed in every new vehicle
(cid:3)This study was supported in part by the US National Science Foun-
dation under grant CNS-0845896, CNS-0845671, and Army Research

is actually an in-vehicle sensor network: the tire pres-
sure monitoring system (TPMS). The wide deployment
of TPMSs in the United States is an outgrowth of the
TREAD Act [35] resulting from the Ford-Firestone tire
failure controversy [17]. Beyond preventing tire fail-
ure, alerting drivers about underin(cid:3)ated tires promises
to increase overall road safety and fuel economy because
proper tire in(cid:3)ation improves traction, braking distances,
and tire rolling resistance. These bene(cid:2)ts have recently
led to similar legislation in the European Union [7] which
mandates TPMSs on all new vehicles starting in 2012.
Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems continuously mea-
sure air pressure inside all tires of passenger cars, trucks,
and multipurpose passenger vehicles, and alert drivers if
any tire is signi(cid:2)cantly underin(cid:3)ated. While both direct
and indirect measurement technologies exist, only direct
measurement has the measurement sensitivity required
by the TREAD Act and is thus the only one in produc-
tion. A direct measurement system uses battery-powered
pressure sensors inside each tire to measure tire pres-
sure and can typically detect any loss greater than 1.45
psi [40]. Since a wired connection from a rotating tire
to the vehicle’s electronic control unit is dif(cid:2)cult to im-
plement, the sensor module communicates its data via a
radio frequency (RF) transmitter. The receiving tire pres-
sure control unit, in turn, analyzes the data and can send
results or commands to the central car computer over
the Controller-area Network (CAN) to trigger a warning
message on the vehicle dashboard, for example. Indirect
measurement systems infer pressure differences between
tires from differences in the rotational speed, which can
be measured using the anti-lock braking system (ABS)
sensors. A lower-pressure tire has to rotate faster to travel
the same distance as a higher-pressure tire. The disad-
vantages of this approach are that it is less accurate, re-
quires calibration by the driver, and cannot detect the si-
multaneous loss of pressure from all tires (for example,
due to temperature changes). While initial versions of the
TREAD Act allowed indirect technology, updated rul-
ings by the United States National Highway Transporta-
tion Safety Administration (NHTSA) have required all
new cars sold or manufactured after 2008 in the United
States to be equipped with direct TPMS [35] due to these
disadvantages.
1.1 Security and Privacy Risks
Security and privacy aspects of vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure communication have received
signi(cid:2)cant consideration by both practitioners and re-
searchers [3, 36]. However, the already deployed in-car
sensor communication systems have received little at-
tention, because (i) the short communication range and
metal vehicle body may render eavesdropping and spoof-
ing attacks dif(cid:2)cult and (ii) tire pressure information ap-
pears to be relatively innocuous. While we agree that
the safety-critical application scenarios for vehicle-to-
vehicle communications face higher security and privacy
risks, we believe that even current tire pressure measure-
ment systems present potential for misuse.
First, wireless devices are known to present tracking
risks through explicit identi(cid:2)ers in protocols [20] or iden-
ti(cid:2)able patterns in waveforms [10]. Since automobiles
have become an essential element of our social fabric (cid:151)
they allow us to commute to and from work; they help us
take care of errands like shopping and taking our children
to day care (cid:151) tracking automobiles presents substantial
risks to location privacy. There is signi(cid:2)cant interest in
wireless tracking of cars, at least for traf(cid:2)c monitoring
purposes. Several entities are using mobile toll tag read-
ers [4] to monitor traf(cid:2)c (cid:3)ows. Tracking through the
TPMS system, if possible, would raise greater concerns
because the use of TPMS is not voluntary and they are
hard to deactivate.
Second, wireless is easier to jam or spoof because no
physical connection is necessary. While spoo(cid:2)ng a low
tire pressure readings does not appear to be critical at
(cid:2)rst, it will lead to a dashboard warning and will likely
cause the driver to pull over and inspect the tire. This
presents ample opportunities for mischief and criminal
activities, if past experience is any indication. Drivers
have been willing to tinker with traf(cid:2)c light timing to re-
duce their commute time [6]. It has also been reported
that highway robbers make drivers pull over by punc-
turing the car tires [23] or by simply signaling a driver
that a tire problem exists. If nothing else, repeated false
alarms will undermine drivers’ faith in the system and
lead them to ignore subsequent TPMS-related warnings,
thereby making the TMPS system ineffective.
To what extent these risks apply to TPMS and more
generally to in-car sensor systems remains unknown. A
key question to judge these risks is whether the range
at which messages can be overheard or spoofed is large
enough to make such attacks feasible from outside the
vehicle. While similar range questions have recently
been investigated for RFID devices [27], the radio prop-
agation environment within an automobile is different
enough to warrant study because the metal body of a car
could shield RF from escaping or entering a car. It is also
unclear whether the TPMS message rate is high enough
to make tracking vehicles feasible. This paper aims to
(cid:2)ll this void, and presents a security and privacy analysis
of state-of-the art commercial tire pressure monitoring
systems, as well as detailed measurements for the com-
munication range for in-car sensor transmissions.
1.2 Contributions
Following our experimental analysis of two popular
TPMSs used in a large fraction of vehicles in the United
States, this paper presents the following contributions:
Lack of security measures. TPMS
communications
are based on standard modulation schemes and
simple protocols. Since the protocols do not rely
on cryptographic mechanisms,
the communica-
tion can be reverse-engineered, as we did using
GNU Radio [2] in conjunction with the Universal
Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) [1], a low-cost
public software radio platform. Moreover,
the
implementation of the in-car system appears to
fully trust all received messages. We found no
evidence of basic security practices, such as input
validation, being followed. Therefore, spoo(cid:2)ng
attacks and battery drain attacks are made possible
and can cause TPMS to malfunction.
Signi(cid:2)cant communication range. While the vehicle’s
metal body does shield the signal, we found a larger
than expected eavesdropping range. TPMS mes-
sages can be correctly received up to 10m from the
car with a cheap antenna and up to 40m with a ba-
sic low noise ampli(cid:2)er. This means an adversary
can overhear or spoof transmissions from the road-
side or possibly from a nearby vehicle, and thus the
transmission powers being used are not low enough
to justify the lack of other security measures.
Vehicle tracking. Each in-tire sensor module contains a
32-bit immutable identi(cid:2)er in every message. The
length of the identi(cid:2)er (cid:2)eld renders tire sensor mod-
ule IDs suf(cid:2)ciently unique to track cars. Although
tracking vehicles is possible through vision-based
automatic license plate identi(cid:2)cation, or through
toll tag or other wireless car components, track-
ing through TPMS identi(cid:2)ers raises new concerns,
because these transmitters are dif(cid:2)cult for drivers
to deactivate as they are available in all new cars
2
and because wireless tracking is a low-cost solution
compared to employing vision technology.
Defenses. We discuss security mechanisms that are ap-
plicable to this low-power in-car sensor scenario
without taking away the ease of operation when in-
stalling a new tire. The mechanisms include rela-
tively straightforward design changes in addition to
recommendations for cryptographic protocols that
will signi(cid:2)cantly mitigate TMPS security risks.
The insights obtained can bene(cid:2)t the design of other
emerging wireless in-car sensing systems. Modern au-
tomobiles contain roughly three miles of wire [31], and
this will only increase as we make our motor vehicles
more intelligent through more on-board electronic com-
ponents, ranging from navigation systems to entertain-
ment systems to in-car sensors. Increasing the amount
of wires directly affects car weight and wire complex-
ity, which decreases fuel economy [13] and imposes dif-
(cid:2)culties on fault diagnosis [31]. For this reason, wire-
less technologies will increasingly be used in and around
the car to collect control/status data of the car’s electron-
ics [16,33]. Thus, understanding and addressing the vul-
nerabilities associated with internal automotive commu-
nications, and TPMS in particular, is essential to ensur-
ing that the new wave of intelligent automotive applica-
tions will be safely deployed within our cars.
1.3 Outline
We begin in Section 2 by presenting an overview of
TPMS and raising related security and privacy con-
cerns. Although the speci(cid:2)cs of the TPMS communi-
cation protocols are proprietary, we present our reverse-
engineering effort that reveals the details of the protocols
in Section 3. Then, we discuss our study on the sus-
ceptibility of TPMS to eavesdropping in Section 4 and
message spoo(cid:2)ng attacks in Section 5. After complet-
ing our security and privacy analysis, we recommend de-
fense mechanisms to secure TPMS in Section 6. Finally,
we wrap up our paper by presenting related work in Sec-
tion 7 before concluding in Section 8.
2 TPMS Overview and Goals
TPMS architecture. A typical direct TPMS contains
the following components: TPM sensors (cid:2)tted into the
back of the valve stem of each tire, a TPM electric con-
trol unit (ECU), a receiving unit (either integrated with
the ECU or stand-alone), a dashboard TPM warning
light, and one or four antennas connected to the receiving
unit. The TPM sensors periodically broadcast the pres-
sure and temperature measurements together with their

identi(cid:2)ers. The TPM ECU/receiver receives the pack-
ets and performs the following operations before send-
ing messages to the TPM warning light. First, since it
can receive packets from sensors belonging to neighbor-
ing cars, it (cid:2)lters out those packets. Second, it performs
temperature compensation, where it normalizes the pres-
sure readings and evaluates tire pressure changes. The
exact design of the system differs across suppliers, par-
ticularly in terms of antenna con(cid:2)guration and commu-
nication protocols. A four-antenna con(cid:2)guration is nor-
mally used in high-end car models, whereby an antenna
is mounted in each wheel housing behind the wheel arch
shell and connected to a receiving unit through high fre-
quency antenna cables, as depicted in Figure 1. The four-
antenna system prolongs sensor battery life, since the an-
tennas are mounted close to the TPM sensors which re-
duces the required sensor transmission power. However,
to reduce automobile cost, the majority of car manufac-
tories use one antenna, which is typically mounted on the
rear window [11, 39].
Communication protocols. The communications pro-
tocols used between sensors and TPM ECUs are propri-
etary. From supplier websites and marketing materials,
however, one learns that TPMS data transmissions com-
monly use the 315 MHz or 433 MHz bands (UHF) and
ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying) or FSK (Frequency Shift
Keying) modulation. Each tire pressure sensor carries an
identi(cid:2)er (ID). Before the TPMS ECU can accept data
reported by tire pressure sensors, IDs of the sensor and
the position of the wheel that it is mounted on have to be
entered to the TPMS ECU either manually in most cars
or automatically in some high-end cars. This is typically
done during tire installation. Afterwards, the ID of the
sensor becomes the key information that assists the ECU
in determining the origin of the data packet and (cid:2)ltering
out packets transmitted by other vehicles.
To prolong battery life, tire pressure sensors are de-
signed to sleep most of the time and wake up in two sce-
narios: (1) when the car starts to travel at high speeds
(over 40 km/h), the sensors are required to monitor tire
3
pressures; (2) during diagnosis and the initial sensor
ID binding phases, the sensors are required to transmit
their IDs or other information to facilitate the procedures.
Thus, the tire pressure sensors will wake up in response
to two triggering mechanisms: a speed higher than 40
km/h detected by an on-board accelerometer or an RF
activation signal.
The RF activation signals operate at 125 kHz in the
low frequency (LF) radio frequency band and can only
wake up sensors within a short range, due to the gener-
ally poor characteristics of RF antennas at that low fre-
quency. According to manuals from different tire sen-
sor manufacturers, the activation signal can be either a
tone or a modulated signal.
In either case, the LF re-
ceiver on the tire sensor (cid:2)lters the incoming activation
signal and wakes up the sensor only when a matching
signal is recognized. Activation signals are mainly used
by car dealers to install and diagnose tire sensors, and are
manufacturer-speci(cid:2)c.
2.1 Security and Privacy Analysis Goals
Our analysis will concentrate on tracking risks through
eavesdropping on sensor identi(cid:2)ers and on message
spoo(cid:2)ng risks to insert forged data in the vehicle ECU.
The presence of an identi(cid:2)er raises the specter of lo-
cation privacy concerns.
If the sensor IDs were cap-
tured at roadside tracking points and stored in databases,
third parties could infer or prove that the driver has vis-
ited potentially sensitive locations such as medical clin-
ics, political meetings, or nightclubs. A similar example
is seen with electronic toll records that are captured at
highway entry and exit points by private entities for traf-
(cid:2)c monitoring purposes. In some states, these records
are frequently subpoenaed for civil lawsuits. If tracking
through the tire pressure monitoring system were pos-
sible, this would create additional concerns, particularly
because the system will soon be present in all cars and
cannot easily be deactivated by a driver.
Besides these privacy risks, we will consider attacks
where an adversary interferes with the normal operations
of TPMS by actively injecting forged messages. For in-
stance, an adversary could attempt to send a low pressure
packet to trigger a low pressure warning. Alternatively,
the adversary could cycle through a few forged low pres-
sure packets and a few normal pressure packets, causing
the low pressure warning lights to turn on and off. Such
attacks, if possible, could undermine drivers’ faith in the
system and potentially lead them to ignore TPMS-related
warnings completely. Last but not least, since the TPM
sensors always respond to the corresponding activation
signal, an adversary that continuously transmits activa-
tion signals can force the tire sensors to send packets
constantly, greatly reducing the lifetime of TPMS.
To evaluate the privacy and security risks of such a
system, we will address the issues listed below in the
following sections.
Dif(cid:2)culty of reverse engineering. Many potential at-
tackers are unlikely to have access to insider in-
formation and must therefore reconstruct the proto-
cols, both to be able to extract IDs to track vehicles
and to spoof messages. The level of information
necessary differs among attacks; replays for exam-
ple might only require knowledge of the frequency
band but more sophisticated spoo(cid:2)ng requires pro-
tocol details. For spoo(cid:2)ng attacks we also consider
