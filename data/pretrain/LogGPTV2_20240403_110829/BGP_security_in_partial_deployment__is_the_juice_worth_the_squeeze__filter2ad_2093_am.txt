security 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respectively. We note, however,
that CP destinations have a higher fraction of happy sources
than other destinations on average, (see Figure 4).
5.2.3 Different destinations see different beneﬁts.
Thus far, we have looked at the impact of S*BGP in ag-
gregate across all destinations d ∈ V (or d ∈ CP ). Because
secure routes can only exist to secure destinations, we now
look at the impact of S*BGP on individual secure destina-
tions d ∈ S, by considering HM(cid:48),d(S).
Figure 7(b). We plot the upper and lower bounds on the
change in the metric, i.e., HM(cid:48),d(S) − HM(cid:48),d(∅), averaged
across secure destinations only, i.e., d ∈ S. As expected,
we ﬁnd large improvements when security is 1st, and small
improvements when security is 3rd. Interestingly, however,
when security is 2nd the metric does increase by 13 − 20%
by the last step in the rollout; while this is still signiﬁcantly
smaller than what is possible when security is 1st, it does
suggest that at least some secure destinations beneﬁt more
when security is 2nd, rather than 3rd.
For more insight, we zoom in on this last step in our rollout:
Figure 9.
For the last step in our rollout, we plot up-
per and lower bounds on the change in the metric, i.e.,
HM(cid:48),d(S) − HM(cid:48),d(∅), for each individual secure destination
d ∈ S. For each of our three models, the lower bound for
each d ∈ S is plotted as a non-decreasing sequence; these are
the three “smooth” lines. The corresponding upper bound
for each d ∈ S was plotted as well. For security 1st, the up-
per and lower bounds are almost identical, and for security
2nd and 3rd, the upper bounds are the “clouds” that hover
over the lower bounds. A few observations:
Security 1st provides excellent protection. We ﬁnd
that when security is 1st, a secure destination can reap the

full beneﬁts of S*BGP even in (a large) partial deployment.
To see this, we computed the true value of HM(cid:48),d(S) for all
secure destinations d ∈ S, and found that it was between
96.8 − 97.9% on average (across all d ∈ S).
Security 2nd and 3rd are similar for many destina-
tions. Figure 9 also reveals that many destinations obtain
roughly the same beneﬁts from S*BGP when security is 2nd
as when security is 3rd. Indeed, 93% of 7500 secure destina-
tions that see  40%)
increases in their security metric HM(cid:48),d(S) (relative to the
baseline setting HM(cid:48),d(∅)) include: (a) all 13 Tier 1s, and
(b) ≥ 99% of “Tier 1 stub” destinations (i.e., stub ASes such
that all their providers are Tier 1 ASes). On the other hand,
these same destinations experience the worst improvements
when security is 2nd or 3rd (i.e., a lower bound of < 3%).
To explain this, recall from Section 4.6 that when secu-
rity is 2nd or 3rd, most source ASes that want to reach a
Tier 1 destination are doomed, because of protocol down-
grade attacks like the one shown in Figure 2. This explains
the meagre beneﬁts these destinations obtain when security
is 2nd or 3rd. On the other hand, protocol downgrade at-
tacks fail when security is 1st. Therefore, in the security
1st model, the Tier 1 destinations (and by extension, Tier 1
stub destinations) obtain excellent security when S*BGP is
partially deployed; moreover, they see most signiﬁcant gains
simply because they were so highly vulnerable to attacks in
the absence of S*BGP (Figure 4, Section 4.6).
Security 2nd helps some secure destinations. Finally,
when security is 2nd, about half of the secure destinations
d ∈ S see beneﬁts that are discernibly better than what is
possible when security is 3rd, though not quite as impressive
