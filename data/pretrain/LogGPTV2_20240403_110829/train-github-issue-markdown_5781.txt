It would be neat if you could just `import { Component } from
'https://unpkg.com/react?module'` in browsers like Safari (and soon Chrome).
As far as I understand the problem, we'd just need to export an ES6 build
target from Rollup.
I use "just" lightly. Hopefully it's that simple; it's probably more
complicated. In any case, now we have an issue for it!
