**Subject: Creating a Fully Standalone .exe from a Python Script**

Hi,

I am looking for a way to create a fully standalone .exe file from a Python script. Executables generated with `py2exe` still require the `pythonXX.dll` file, which means the Python runtime library needs to be installed on the target machine.

My goal is to produce a completely self-contained .exe that does not require any additional installations. It seems like this might be a linking issue, and I am considering using a static library instead of a dynamic one. Additionally, it would be beneficial to strip out unused symbols to reduce the size of the final executable.

Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations on how to achieve this?

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Alessandro

**Subject: Re: Creating a Fully Standalone .exe from a Python Script**

Hi Alessandro,

While using an SFX (Self-Extracting) archive with both the .exe and .dll files inside and setting it to execute the .exe when double-clicked is a possible solution, it may not be the most elegant or user-friendly approach.

A better alternative is to use tools specifically designed to create fully standalone executables from Python scripts. Here are a few options you can consider:

1. **PyInstaller**: PyInstaller can bundle your Python script along with all its dependencies into a single executable. It supports various options for customizing the build process, including stripping out unused symbols.
   - Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
   - Create the standalone .exe: `pyinstaller --onefile your_script.py`

2. **Nuitka**: Nuitka is a Python-to-C++ compiler that can also generate standalone executables. It offers more advanced features and can potentially produce more optimized executables.
   - Install Nuitka: `pip install nuitka`
   - Create the standalone .exe: `nuitka --standalone --onefile your_script.py`

3. **cx_Freeze**: Another tool that can create standalone executables, though it may still require some additional configuration to ensure all dependencies are included.
   - Install cx_Freeze: `pip install cx_Freeze`
   - Create the standalone .exe: `cxfreeze your_script.py --target-dir dist --base-name=Win32GUI`

These tools should help you achieve your goal of creating a fully standalone .exe without requiring the Python runtime to be installed on the target machine.

I hope this helps!

Best regards,
