User: is there a way to create a standalone .exe from a python script.
Executables generated with py2exe can run only with pythonXX.dll.
I'd like to obtain a fully standalone .exe which does not require to install the python runtime library.
It looks like a linking problem but using static library instead the dynamic one and it would be also useful to apply a strip in order to remove the unused symbols.
Any idea ?
Thanks.
Alessandro
Assistant: This is not the best way to do it, but you might consider using executable SFX Archive with both the .exe and .dll files inside, and setting it to execute your .exe file when it's double clicked.
