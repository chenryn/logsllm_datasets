# Specifications of Message Formats and Protocols

The OWL-S Editor plug-in provides an excellent overview of the relationships between different OWL-S ontologies. These relationships are displayed in an intuitive manner through the Graphic User Interface (GUI) and can also be visualized as a graph.

## OntoEdit

### Overview
OntoEdit, developed by the Knowledge Management Group at the AIFB Institute of the University of Karlsruhe, is an ontology engineering environment designed for creating, browsing, maintaining, and managing ontologies. The tool supports collaborative development through a client/server architecture, where ontologies are managed on a central server and can be accessed and modified by multiple clients. Currently, the successor to OntoEdit is OntoStudio, a commercial product based on IBM’s Eclipse development environment. OntoStudio can be downloaded for a three-month free evaluation period.

### Features
- **Language Independence**: OntoEdit was designed to be independent and neutral of any specific representation language.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a powerful GUI for representing concept hierarchies, relations, domains, ranges, instances, and axioms.
- **Multilingual Support**: Each concept or relation name can be specified in multiple languages, making it useful for international teams.
- **Internal Data Model**: Uses OXML 2.0, a frame-based data model defined in XML using XML-Schema.
- **Export and Import Capabilities**: Supports exporting to DAML+OIL, F-Logic, RDF(S), and OXML, and importing from DAML+OIL, Excel, F-Logic, RDF(S), and OXML.
- **API and Inference Engine**: Provides an API for object-oriented access to ontologies and uses the OntoBroker inference engine, which supports expressive rules in F-Logic.
- **Plug-in Architecture**: Allows users to extend functionality with third-party plug-ins, such as the Sesame plug-in for storing and querying RDF and RDF Schema.

## DOE (Differential Ontology Editor)

### Overview
DOE, developed by the Institut National de l’Audiovisuel (INA) in France, is a simple ontology editor that follows the methodology proposed by Bruno Bachimont. It is designed to complement other ontology editors rather than compete with them.

### Features
- **Formal Specification Process**: Guides users through the process of structuring ontologies with a focus on linguistic techniques.
- **Differential Semantics**: Users build taxonomies of concepts and relations, justifying each notion's position in the hierarchy based on four principles: Similarity with Parent, Similarity with Siblings, Difference with Sibling, and Difference with Parent.
- **Referential Ontology**: Allows users to disambiguate notions and clarify their meanings for domain-specific applications.
- **Export Mechanism**: Translates taxonomies into exchange languages like OWL.
- **Import/Export Formats**: Supports RDFS and OWL formats for import and CGXML, DAML+OIL, OIL, RDFS, RDF/XML, and OWL for export.
- **Interoperability**: Uses XSLT for transforming XML documents, promoting interoperability with other tools.

### Installation
DOE is available for Windows and requires Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Version 1.3 or later. The installation process is straightforward, and the tool can be downloaded from the INA website after filling out a form.

## IsaViz

### Overview
IsaViz, developed by Emmanuel Pietriga and offered by the W3C Consortium, is a visual environment for browsing and authoring RDF models as graphs. It is built on ZVTM (Zoomable Visual Transformation Machine) and includes contributions from various research institutions.

### Features
- **Graphical Representation**: Displays RDF models as 2D graphs with smooth zooming capabilities.
- **Multiple View Modes**: Offers Graph View, Radar View, and Property Browser for different perspectives on the RDF model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a palette of tools, a Definitions window with tabs for namespaces, property types, and stylesheets, and an Attribute window for editing attributes.
- **Rendering and Styling**: Uses GSS (a stylesheet language derived from CSS and SVG) to style RDF models.
- **Import/Export Formats**: Supports importing RDF/XML and N-Triples, and exporting RDF/XML, N-Triples, PNG, and SVG.
- **Support and Documentation**: Provides a user manual, installation instructions, a mailing list, and a list of common problems.

### Installation
IsaViz is implemented in Java and requires a JVM 1.3.x. The current stable version is 2.1 (October 2004), with an alpha version 3.0 (December 2005) in development.
