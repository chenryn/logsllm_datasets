In straight MVC (no WebFlow), there is a referenceData method that gets  
called when hitting a SimpleFormController in GET mode. This is very useful  
for things like pulldown contents on a search form, etc.
However, this method does not get called in POST mode. When your success page
is different than  
the search page this presents no problem. However, if you want the search
results to  
show up in a table below the search form, for example, the onSubmit method  
would need to do some duplicate calls for that pulldown data, as the form only
knows which value in the  
pulldown was submitted. We could just have referenceData and onSubmit both
delegate  
to the same helper method, and then onSubmit would manually add the pulldown  
contents to the returned model. What would be really nice would to be able to  
control whether or not referenceData was needed in POST mode.
