I would like to bring to your attention an observation I made while using the beta version. During server-side rendering, specifically when utilizing custom routing and `renderToHTML`, there are certain server-side dependencies that I need to incorporate. For example, I require a method for injecting requests directly into my Hapi application, so that the server-side data fetching process bypasses the network interface. Additionally, in some cases, I need to seed an initial Redux store based on the request.

Currently, I am achieving this by attaching custom properties to the Node `Request` object, which is then passed into the context. While this approach works, it can be somewhat cumbersome. I wanted to highlight this in case you consider enhancing the ease of adding server-specific properties to the `getInitialProps` context.
