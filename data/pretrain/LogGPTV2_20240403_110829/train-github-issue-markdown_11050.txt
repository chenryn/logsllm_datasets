Just wanted to raise something that I’ve noticed using the beta.
During server-side rendering (using the custom routing and `renderToHTML`),
there are some server-side dependencies I want to make available (for example,
a means of injecting requests directly into my Hapi app so that the server-
side data fetching doesn’t go through a network interface). In some cases I
also have data to seed an initial Redux store based on the request.
Currently I’m getting this data in by attaching custom properties to the Node
`Request` object that’s passed in to the context.
This is fine, though a little awkward. I was raising this up in case you want
to make it easier to add server-specific properties to the `getInitialProps`
context.
