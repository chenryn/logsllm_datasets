User: How to install Docker on Ubuntu server and deploy a containerized application?
Assistant: Here are the steps to install Docker on an Ubuntu server and deploy a containerized application: 1. Update apt-get ```bash sudo apt-get update ``` 2. Install dependencies ```bash sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common ``` 3. Add Docker warehouse GPG key ```bash curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt -key add - ``` 4. Add Docker repository On Ubuntu 18.04: ```bash sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable" ``` On Ubuntu 20.04: ```bash sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" ``` 5. Update apt-get ```bash sudo apt-get update ``` 6. Install Docker ```bash sudo apt-get install docker-ce ``` 7. Verify that Docker is installed correctly ```bash sudo docker run hello-world `` ` 8. Deploy containerized applications For example, we can use Docker Compose to deploy a simple Node.js application. First, we need to create a docker-compose.yaml file: ```yaml version: "3" services: web: build: . ports: - "3000:3000" ``` Next, we need to create a file containing our Node A Docker image for the .js application. We can create a Dockerfile in our application root directory: ```dockerfile FROM node:8 WORKDIR /app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 3000 CMD [ "npm", "start" ] ``` Run the following command in our application root directory to build the image using Docker: ```bash sudo docker build -t my-node-app . ``` Finally, run the following command in the application root directory To deploy the application using Docker Compose: ```bash sudo docker-compose up -d ``` Now, our containerized application should be running successfully on the Ubuntu server.
