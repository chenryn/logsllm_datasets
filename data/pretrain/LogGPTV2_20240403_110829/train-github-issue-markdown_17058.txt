  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
Celery versions affected: 4.2.0rc4, 4.2.0rc2  
Last working version: 4.1.1
## Steps to reproduce
  1. Start up a worker with gevent pool
  2. send celery control cancel_consumer remote comand
  3. Send celery control add_consumer remote command
## Expected behavior
Cancel consumer should remove all the workers consuming from the given queue  
Add consumer should add a specified consumer to the given queue
## Actual behavior
Cancel consumer removes the workers from the queue as expected  
Add consumer throws the following exception and the worker dies
