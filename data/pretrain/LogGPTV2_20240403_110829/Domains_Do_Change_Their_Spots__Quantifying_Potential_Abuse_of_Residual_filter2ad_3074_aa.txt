## Abstract
When domains expire and are released to the public, adversaries can re-register them to exploit residual trust from clients unaware of the change in ownership. Domain name resolution is integral to the web, making potential clients range from human users to automated processes like system updates. This provides adversaries with an attack vector that can affect a wide array of systems and devices. We hypothesize that some domains, while valuable for security, may not be considered valuable by dropcatchers, allowing adversaries to re-register them without engaging in competitive auctions.

In this paper, we investigate this attack vector using a top-down, opportunistic approach. Over a one-month re-registration period, we identified potentially valuable dropped domains using a threshold of passive DNS resolutions, re-registered, and deployed them with basic honeypot services. Our honeypot services recorded over 650 million requests from 5.5 million unique IP addresses across 22,744 autonomous systems to the 201 re-registered domains. While many of these domains may not pose significant security risks, we focus on unusual domains that receive significantly more traffic and different types of traffic. These include domains previously used as torrent trackers, APIs for university computer lab usage statistics, Android haptics libraries, security company DNS sinkhole servers, Internet radio stations, command-and-control servers for malware, and email trackers.

Our findings demonstrate that expired domains pose a real threat to the security of the Internet ecosystem, and adversaries with modest budgets can compromise a wide range of systems and services by re-registering previously popular domains that were allowed to expire.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the distributed phone book of the Internet, translating human-readable domain names into their corresponding IP addresses. DNS queries are essential for web functionality but are abstracted from the user experience. Queries are handled by optimized, local, and dedicated DNS resolvers, which resolve domain names to IP addresses in milliseconds.

A critical yet often overlooked detail is that domains can expire and change ownership without users' knowledge. If a domain expires and changes hands, its residual trust—the historical reputation—is implicitly transferred to the new owners. There are no built-in mechanisms to warn clients when a domain's ownership has changed, creating an attack surface that exploits prior trust. This is a subset of the broader problem of integrity verification on the web.

If a malicious actor re-registers an expired domain with residual trust, they can exploit all residual trust traffic. Clients that depend on domain name resolution, including end users, JavaScript libraries, and system updates, are susceptible to contributing to this traffic. The rise of the dropcatch ecosystem, where companies build infrastructure to re-register valuable expired domains, has been studied [2], [3], [4]. The value of such domains is typically derived from characteristics like string length, previous traffic, popularity rankings, and past search engine indexing.

Academic interest has focused on how expired domains can enable attacks on otherwise secure systems. For example, Lever et al. found instances of residual-trust issues in browser extensions [1] and malware [5]. Alowaisheq et al. discovered that even dangerous domains sinkholed by security researchers and governments can be re-registered and used to revive dormant botnets [6]. Other researchers have shown that expired domains can be abused to inject malicious JavaScript [7] and evade secure Content Security Policies (CSPs) [8].

Prior academic work has taken a bottom-up approach, starting with specific systems and then quantifying how expired domains can compromise them. In contrast, we present a top-down approach, re-registering domains in a target-agnostic manner to detect and quantify potential abuse of residual trust. Our approach mimics that of an opportunistic attacker who re-registers expired domains and discovers that some still receive traffic due to residual trust.

Using our top-down approach, we find that not only are the specific concerns described by bottom-up studies likely to occur, but they are also not financially difficult to execute. Our study aims to understand and quantify the feasibility of valuable domains slipping through the dropcatch industry and being obtained by lower-budget registrants. With the increasing number of domain registrations and expirations, a better understanding of this attack vector is necessary to ensure the security of both end users and dependent systems.

We summarize our contributions as follows:
- **Large-scale analysis and profiling:** We conducted a four-month analysis of residual trust traffic to 201 domains, demonstrating that new owners can identify the type of service previously offered on a domain using traffic logs, third-party references, and historical archives. We categorized 128 domains and found that residual trust traffic does not necessarily decay over time.
- **Infrastructure design and evaluation:** We designed and implemented an infrastructure to identify domains with exploitable residual trust traffic, including automated pipelines for selection, re-registration, and deployment of expired domain candidates, and detection of residual trust traffic.
- **Evidence of widespread impact:** We provide evidence that residual trust abuse can affect millions of IP addresses across tens of thousands of autonomous systems, even with a simple domain selection strategy. We spent $1,464.64 to re-register 201 domains and found that some would enable an adversary to gather, manipulate, and compromise unaware clients and systems.

## 2. Residual Trust in DNS
Domain information is managed by registrars and registries following standardized processes created by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The processes vary depending on the top-level domain (TLD) and the managing entity. For example, country-code TLDs are managed by their respective countries, while generic TLDs are managed by ICANN.

Domains are generally registered for several years and must be renewed upon expiration. Generic TLDs follow ICANN’s Expired Registration Recovery Policy (ERRP), which grants expiring domain owners buffer time to renew their domain before it is released to the public. The ERRP mandates that domain registrars notify domain owners twice (up to one month) before expiration and once (within five days) after expiration. After the registrar deletes a domain, it enters the Redemption Grace Period, during which the expired domain owner can still renew the domain, usually at a higher price. The domain becomes publicly available for re-registration five days after the grace period ends.

Since there is no inherent mechanism to warn of changes in domain ownership, unaware clients may continue to contact domains after expiration and deletion. If a deleted domain is re-registered and receives residual traffic, the new owner will have access to all incoming communications. Traditional techniques like HTTPS will not maintain confidentiality if the receiver is operated by the re-registrant. Only obscure or non-standard communication methods might remain opaque to the re-registrant.

Remote identity verification mechanisms, such as HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP), have been proposed but are now deprecated due to usability and security issues. Even if HPKP were enabled, it would be difficult to determine whether a pinning violation was caused by a misconfiguration or an attack, and whether the new domain owner is malicious or benign.

As the new owner has access to all communication to their domain, they can identify the type of service previously offered and build specific infrastructure to gather more information from client interactions. Depending on the nature of the previous services, the new owner can gain varying levels of personally identifiable information, including IP addresses, geolocation, device fingerprints, and user credentials.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a top-down approach to investigate the feasibility of residual trust abuse. We designed and implemented pipelines to automatically identify potentially valuable expired domains and quantify the potential for abuse.
