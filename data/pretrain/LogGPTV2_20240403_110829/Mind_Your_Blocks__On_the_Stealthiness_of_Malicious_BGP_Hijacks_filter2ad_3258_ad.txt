These few publications show the existence and the reality
of BGP hijacks in the wild but the scarcity of the attacks ob-
served since 2006 give the impression that this threat remains
highly anecdotal and that no infrastructure seems to have been
put in place by hackers to automatize efﬁciently, systemati-
cally, the launching of BGP hijacks. The results we present
here after will portray a very different situation in which,
every day, several BGP hijacks are taking place. Furthermore,
we show that this is by no means a new phenomenon. Our
data highlight that this has taken place for 18 months, without
anyone noticing it apparently.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We have set up a comprehensive experimental environ-
ment
to study the BGP hijacking spammers phenomenon.
The complete setup is depicted in Figure 1. Our goal here
is to A collect routing data related to spam networks, B
extract from this data IP address blocks exhibiting an abnormal
routing behavior and retain the ones most likely indicating they
might result from a BGP hijack, C manually (in)validate each
candidate hijack by taking advantage of external data sources,
and ﬁnally D investigate the root cause behind some validated
malicious BGP hijacks to obtain new insights into hijacking
spammers behavior.
Our experimental setup builds upon SPAMTRACER [47],
a system designed for the collection and analysis of routing
data related to spam networks. The assumption behind this

from six RouteViews BGP collectors distributed worldwide.
Additionally, we map every IP-level hop in traceroutes to the
AS announcing it and further enrich the path with geolocation
information [3] and the registered holder [11] of each IP- and
AS-level hop traversed by a traceroute.
To summarize, every spam IP address block monitored over
7 consecutive days is associated with:
•
•
•
a set of daily IP/AS traceroute paths from our vantage
point to the network;
a set of daily BGP AS paths from the six Routeviews
BGP collectors to the network;
additional information on the geolocation and owner
of each intermediate IP- and AS-level hop in tracer-
outes.
B. Multi-stage scoring and data ﬁltering
As the amount of IP address blocks to monitor increased
signiﬁcantly over time, we needed a mechanism to automat-
ically investigate them. This is why we designed a multi-
stage scoring and ﬁltering system that analyzes the raw data,
identiﬁes abnormal routing events, assigns individual scores
based on a consistent set of criteria, and then aggregates all
scores to eventually highlight IP blocks most likely indicating
possible BGP hijacks. We describe here the main components
of this multi-stage scoring and ﬁltering system.
1) Traceroute and BGP anomaly scoring:
In [47] we
introduced a set of heuristics that proved to be effective at
identifying BGP and Traceroute anomalies. With the limited
data we had at our disposal at that time (April-Sep 2011),
this approach had only unveiled a limited number of cases
involving a few IP blocks being hijacked. In this paper, we
apply it to a much larger dataset and reveal a signiﬁcantly
larger amount of successful hijacks.
