User: Please list several different design patterns and briefly describe their applications.
Assistant: 1. Factory pattern: The factory pattern is a creative design pattern, the purpose is to separate the creation and use of objects. This pattern uses a factory method to implement object creation, rather than instantiating objects directly by using the new operator. The factory pattern can provide better flexibility and make the code easier to maintain and expand. Commonly used factory patterns include simple factory, factory method and abstract factory. 2. Singleton mode: Singleton mode is a creative design pattern, its purpose is to ensure that only one object of a class is created and provide a global access point. This pattern is very suitable for classes that need to implement some global state or logic, such as configuration managers, loggers, etc. 3. Observer mode: The observer mode is a behavioral design mode, which defines a one-to-many dependency relationship, allowing multiple observer objects to monitor a certain subject object at the same time. When a subject object changes, all observers that depend on it are notified and automatically updated. Observer pattern is very common in event-driven programming, such as GUI applications, web applications, etc. 4. Proxy mode: Proxy mode is a structural design mode, which provides a proxy object to an object to control access to the object. The proxy object has the same interface as the proxy object, and the client can directly interact with the proxy object without knowing the existence of the proxy object. Proxy mode is often used in logging, access control, remote calling and other scenarios. 5. Strategy pattern: The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a set of interchangeable algorithms that allow the algorithm to change independently of the client using the algorithm. The strategy mode enables the client to choose and replace the algorithm more flexibly by encapsulating the algorithm into an independent policy object. Common strategy patterns include sorting algorithms, encryption algorithms, caching algorithms, etc.
