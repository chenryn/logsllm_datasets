User:  Use the shell language to write commands to start multiple dockers
Assistant: The following is a simple example to start multiple docker containers with a shell script: ``` #!/bin/bash # Define a list of docker containers that need to be started declare -a containers=("container1" "container2" "container3") # Traverse container list for container in "${containers[@]}" do echo "Starting $container" docker run -d --name $container image_name done ``` This script first defines an array of docker containers that need to be started , and then iterate over this array, executing the docker run command for each element to start the container. Here image_name should be replaced with the name of the docker image you need to start. Note that this is just a simple example, actual scripts may require more complex logic, such as checking to see if the container is already running, and if so, you may need to stop the container and restart it, or skip already running containers. You may also need to add more options to the docker run command, such as port mapping, mounting volumes, etc.
