When I ran the command `pip install scrapy`, I encountered the following error:

Upon further investigation, I discovered that the issue was related to the `cryptography` package. To resolve this, I followed the steps outlined in a helpful guide: [Install Cryptography using your own OpenSSL on macOS](https://example.com/install-cryptography-macos).

Here are the commands I executed:

```sh
$ brew install openssl
$ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" pip install cryptography
$ pip install scrapy
```

After running these commands, I was able to successfully install Scrapy.

I am unsure if this is a common issue for macOS users. If it is, I suggest that the installation guide could be more specific and include these steps for macOS users.
