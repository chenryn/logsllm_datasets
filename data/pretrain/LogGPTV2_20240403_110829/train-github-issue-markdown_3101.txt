I run `pip install scrapy`, and it only gives me the error:

then I realized there is something wrong with `cryptography`, then I found
this would be helpful: Install Cryptography using your own openssl on os x
Accroding to the link above, I run the following command:
    $ brew install openssl
    $ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" pip install cryptography
    $ pip install scrapy
Then I successfully installed scrapy.  
I don't know whether it's common for OS X users, if so, I think maybe the
installation guide could be more specific for OS X.
System: OS X Yosemite 10.10.2  
Python : 2.7.9
