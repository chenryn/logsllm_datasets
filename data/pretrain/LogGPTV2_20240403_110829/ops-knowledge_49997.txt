Question: "In a case study of a web service that aggregates user data, it has been proposed to mitigate the exposure of sensitive information through data queries by employing 'k-anonymity' models. What is the most compelling counterargument to this proposal?"
 "A": "'K-anonymity' models can still be susceptible to linking attacks when the attacker possesses auxiliary information."
 "B": "'K-anonymity' models will significantly improve the performance of the web service by reducing the data processing needs."
 "C": "Implementing 'k-anonymity' will make the data completely secure and immune to any form of statistical inference."
 "D": "The use of 'k-anonymity' is not necessary since users are already aware that their data can be used for statistical purposes."
Answer: A
