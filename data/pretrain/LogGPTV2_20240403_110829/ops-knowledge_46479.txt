User: So I have uTorrent set up to run a Python script when a torrent's state is changed so it can sort it. It all works fine except it takes focus from whatever I'm doing and it's crazy annoying.
I run it using sorter.py <arguments>. I'm on Windows 10. What can I do, if anything, to get this to run in the background and not take focus from what I'm doing?
I'm also sorry if this has already been answered but I couldn't find anything that worked.
Assistant: Running with pythonw (or changing extension to .pyw which is the same) may help.
pythonw.exe doesn't create a console window but I dunno about focus. It doesn't create any windows by default, either, so it shouldn't steal it.
