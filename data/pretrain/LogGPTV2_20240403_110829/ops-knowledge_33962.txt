User: I'm using this javascript library (http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) to upload file to a tornado web server, but I don't know how to get the file content. The javascript library is uploading using XHR, so I assume I have to read the raw post data to get the file content. But I don't know how to do it with Tornado. Their documentation doesn't help with this, as usual :(
In php they have something like this:
$input = fopen("php://input", "r");
so what's the equivalence in tornado?
Assistant: I got the answer.
I need to use self.request.body to get the raw post data.
I also need to pass in the correct _xsrf token, otherwise tornado will fire a 403 exception.
So that's about it.
