User: I am trying to start some background processing through rabbitmq, but when I send the request, I get the below error in the rabbitmq log. But, I think I am providing the right credentials, as my celery works are able to connect to rabbitmq server using the same username/password combination.

=ERROR REPORT==== 12-Jun-2012::20:50:29 ===
exception on TCP connection  from 127.0.0.1:41708
{channel0_error,starting,
                {amqp_error,access_refused,
                            "AMQPLAIN login refused: user 'guest' - invalid credentials",
                            'connection.start_ok'}}
Assistant: To get resolve connection with rabbitmq need to inspect below points:

Connectivity from client machine to rabbitmq server machine [in case if client and server are running on separate machine], need to check
along with port as well.
Credential (username and password), a user must be onboarded into RabbitMQ which will be used to connect with RabbitMQ
Permission to User must be given (permission may be attached to VHOST as well so need to provide permission carefully)
