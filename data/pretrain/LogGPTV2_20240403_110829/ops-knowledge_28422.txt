I am attempting to initiate some background processing through RabbitMQ, but I encounter the following error in the RabbitMQ log when I send the request. I believe I am providing the correct credentials, as my Celery workers are able to connect to the RabbitMQ server using the same username and password combination.

**Error Report:**
```
=ERROR REPORT==== 12-Jun-2012::20:50:29 ===
exception on TCP connection from 127.0.0.1:41708
{channel0_error,starting,
                {amqp_error,access_refused,
                            "AMQPLAIN login refused: user 'guest' - invalid credentials",
                            'connection.start_ok'}}
```

To resolve the connection issue with RabbitMQ, please inspect the following points:

1. **Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that there is proper network connectivity between the client machine and the RabbitMQ server machine, especially if they are running on separate machines.
   - Verify that the necessary ports are open and accessible.

2. **Credentials:**
   - Confirm that the username and password provided are correct and match the ones configured in RabbitMQ.
   - Ensure that the user has been properly onboarded into RabbitMQ and is set up to use the specified credentials.

3. **Permissions:**
   - Check that the user has the appropriate permissions to access the RabbitMQ resources.
   - If virtual hosts (vhosts) are in use, ensure that the user has the necessary permissions for the specific vhost.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the connection issue and successfully start the background processing.
