### Configuring CERs with Data Classes

CERs can be configured to use four data classes in 16 (2^4) possible ways, which we refer to as combinations. Each combination corresponds to whether a particular data class is present or not. For example, one combination might include both C1 and C4, while another might include only C1 or only C4.

### Diversity of CoS Configuration in Enterprises

Figure 11 examines the diversity of CoS configurations across CERs within an enterprise. The X-axis represents the number of combinations present in an enterprise, and the Y-axis shows the fraction of enterprises that contain fewer than a specific number of combinations. We observe that 60% of enterprises are homogeneous, using just one single combination (i.e., the same set of classes are configured in all CERs). However, other enterprises exhibit more diversity, with some having up to seven different combinations. This heterogeneity may arise from variations in bandwidth capacity provisioned across sites and the unique CoS requirements of each site. For instance, a site hosting a VoIP customer service center may need only a high-priority real-time class, while a site with multiple applications may require a mix of voice and data classes. Additionally, data centers and headquarters often have higher capacity to the provider backbone compared to peripheral locations.

### Usage of Possible Combinations

Figure 12 investigates whether all, or only a subset, of the 16 possible combinations are actually configured. Each combination is considered, and the number of enterprises with at least one CER using the combination is counted. It is notable that all possible combinations are configured in some VPNs. Moreover, some combinations are more popular than others; eight combinations (combinations 9 to 16) are each present in over 10 enterprises. These combinations correspond to different arrangements involving the class C3 (i.e., C3 alone, or C3 plus a subset of other classes), with the most common being the use of C3 alone, present in 100 enterprises. Further discussion with the designer indicates that C3 is the recommended default class for customers. Even among homogeneous enterprises, 11 combinations are used, indicating significant diversity in CoS usage across enterprises.

Overall, these results show that:
1. CoS usage is prevalent in enterprise VPNs.
2. There is significant diversity in CoS usage across enterprises.
3. There is a large degree of heterogeneity in how routers within an enterprise are configured.

These findings support the need for formal modeling of CoS policies.

### Tracing End-to-End CoS Design Patterns

One application of our tool is to identify all possible treatments a flowset may receive on an end-to-end path. This helps operators analyze the design patterns used in CoS design and identify potentially anomalous patterns.

Figure 13 illustrates the output obtained with our tool when run on the end-to-end path between two CERs (CER1-PER1-PER2-CER2) in ENT6. The left side of the figure shows three policies within CER1, the central portion shows the marking policy at the ingress interface of PER1, and the right side shows the queuing policy at the egress interface of PER2.

At CER1, traffic from the customer site (denoted by S) can be marked using markers M2, M3, or M4, as belonging to C2, C3, or C4. Traffic corresponding to each of these classes is policed according to different parameters (dictated by policers P2, P3, and P4), and compliant/non-compliant traffic of different classes is then queued in separate queues Q2, Q3, and Q4. Some interesting aspects of the design include:
1. A subset of traffic marked as belonging to each of these classes is simply transmitted (denoted by a policing rule Tx) without compliance checks and is queued based on markings obtained at the input interface. This traffic corresponds to SLA probe traffic, which may be injected to help determine if the traffic meets performance metrics specified in the SLAs.
2. A subset of traffic marked as belonging to C2, C3, and C4 in the input interface is overridden and re-marked as network management traffic by the policer Pm. This traffic typically includes SNMP query traffic and BGP routing update traffic, which must be treated separately from data classes and is queued separately in Qm.

Customer traffic leaving CER1 enters the ingress interface of PER1. Based on the ToS byte of each packet, PER1 changes the EXP field in its MPLS label. Network management traffic has the EXP value set unconditionally, while the EXP value of data traffic is changed conditionally based on compliance with preset traffic parameters. Interestingly, traffic corresponding to C2 and C3 is provided with an identical EXP value, indicating that while differentiation occurs at the enterprise edge, the traffic is treated identically in the MPLS core. However, C4 traffic continues to be treated at a lower priority level inside the core.

Finally, the right side of the figure shows how traffic is treated as it comes out of PER2 and before entering CER2. C3 and C4 traffic enter separate queues, while the same queue is used for C1, C2, and network management (NM) traffic. Note that the treatment for these three traffic classes can still differ (e.g., with different drop probabilities during congestion).

This example highlights the power of our model in automatically extracting the patterns used by the designer in identifying treatment for various flows. It also underscores the need for a systematic model given the significant complexity of possible treatments received by a flowset.

### Detecting Shadowed Policy Configurations

Our model can help highlight shadowed policies. For instance, a CER may have a queuing policy for four different classes, but no traffic is ever classified as belonging to one of the classes, making that portion of the policy unused.

In identifying shadowed policy configurations within a CER, we consider two types of shadowing:
1. **Universal Shadowing**: Classes are shadowed when the universal set of flows (see ยง5 and Table 1) are fed through a CER, indicating that a portion of the policy configuration is never utilized regardless of the traffic.
2. **Address Space Shadowing**: Shadowing occurs only when the input flow contains a source address in the address space of the CER, indicating that a portion of the policy configuration is not utilized given the current address space assignments but might be used later when the address space changes.

Figure 14 shows the prevalence of shadowed policies in 150 enterprises. The number of CERs with a particular type of shadowing is computed for each enterprise, and a CDF is plotted. Approximately 35% of the enterprises have some CERs with shadowed classes, and 5% have more than five routers shadowed. While the presence of shadowing might indicate an inadvertent error, it may also be due to legacy configuration lines or actual design intent. For example, in enterprise ENT139, 36 CERs have universal shadowing of class C4 in the policing and queuing policy configurations. A potential benign explanation is that this was a deliberate design intent to remove class C4 from these routers. The operators may have modified the marking policy to no longer mark flows as C4 but did not remove the existing policing and queuing rules. Our tool can bring such examples to the operators' attention for further evaluation.

### Mapping Network-Wide CoS Designs

Using our tool, one can obtain network-wide views of CoS designs. We introduce a simple abstraction called a CoS matrix, which models how various traffic classes can be exchanged between two CERs (see Figure 15(a) for an example). A CoS matrix can be visualized with a directed graph where each node represents a CER annotated with a set of configured classes (denoted d:) and active classes (denoted a:), taking shadowing into account. A bidirectional link between two nodes indicates symmetric communication using a particular set of traffic classes.

We have generated such graphs for all enterprises in our dataset and discuss some interesting examples below.

**Figure 15(a)** illustrates the CoS matrix for ENT1, a simple VPN with two CERs. The annotations on each CER indicate that policies for C1, C3, and C4 are defined, but only C1 traffic may exit the router once shadowed policies are considered. The two routers have a link annotated with C1, indicating that C1 traffic can be exchanged in either direction.

**Figure 15(b)** depicts the CoS matrix for ENT20, which has three CERs. In this case, traffic corresponding to C2 and C3 may exit each router, consistent with the operator's configuration. However, considering the address spaces, each router pair can only exchange C3 traffic. These examples highlight the value of our model in reasoning about effective traffic exchange between two VPN sites.

**Figure 16** considers ENT83, a more complex VPN with nine CERs. Four routers (CER3, CER4, CER5, and CER6) form a clique and exchange C1 and C3 traffic, as shown by the dotted lines. Two other routers (CER1 and CER2) are exclusively configured with C1 and can only exchange C1 traffic with other sites, possibly corresponding to voice call centers. CER1 and CER2 are co-located with backup routers (CER1b and CER2b), forming a primary-backup arrangement. CER3, another primary-backup arrangement, has a default route back to itself, indicating it is a gateway site for all internet traffic. Such redundant arrangements are mainly employed for critical sites.
