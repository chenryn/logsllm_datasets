## Bug Report

### Issue
I am attempting to build PyTorch 1.2.0 from source. The CMake phase completes successfully, but the build process fails.

### Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:
1. Run the build command:
   ```sh
   $ python setup.py build
   ```

### Error Output
The build process fails with the following error messages:
```
