Adversaries may compromise third-party servers to support their operations during both the targeting and post-compromise phases. These compromised servers can be used for various malicious activities, such as staging, launching, and executing attacks. Additionally, adversaries may leverage these servers for Command and Control (C2) communications. By compromising existing third-party servers, adversaries can avoid the costs and potential scrutiny associated with purchasing or renting a new server or virtual private server (VPS).
