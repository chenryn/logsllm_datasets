User: I want to add a scheduled task to fetch a URL via cron job using google app engine. I am continuously getting a failure. I am just fetching www.google.com. Why is the url fetch failing? Am I missing something?
Assistant: "fetch" your OWN url (on appspot.com probably, but, who cares -- use a relative url anywau1-), not google.com, the homepage of the search engine -- what's that got to do w/your app anyway?!-)...
