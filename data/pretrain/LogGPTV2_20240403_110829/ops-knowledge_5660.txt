User: I have Python code that works on a 32bit intel machine running Ubuntu, and I need to run this code on Raspberry Pi. Would I need some sort of cross compiling? I have 32bit .so files included in python.
Assistant: Python is an interpreted bytecode language, so the actual python code does not need to be cross compiled in any way;
Your shared libraries, files ending in .so are not python, however.  You will need to obtain versions of those compiled for the correct architecture.  It might well be that those are ordinary C extensions for python, which can be built via setuptools or other means, which works equally well on ARM as it does on i386.
