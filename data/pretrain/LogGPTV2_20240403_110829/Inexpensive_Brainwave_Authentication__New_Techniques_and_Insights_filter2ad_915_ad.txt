Table 4: Overall comparison of authentication protocols
on enjoyability and required attention, as well as the lower
design effort with respect to the N400:Sentences. The P300
category of protocols showed the worst accuracy. In this case,
usability improves when users select their own secret image.
This preference on active selection was also observed by
Chuang et al. [20] in protocols where users either had to
chose or were imposed a mental task for authentication. The
most positive of P300 protocols is that they are the easiest to
implement.
In summary, N400:Faces was the most accurate task and the
best ranked by users, outperforming the rest of the protocols in
all dimensions. Nevertheless, performance needs to be further
improved for its application in real scenarios.
7.2 Security
In this paper we covered a zero effort attacker model, but,
like in other biometric methods, adversaries can also attack
brainwave authentication by compromising different parts of
the system [8]. The most applicable attack vector that tar-
gets speciﬁc users is arguably the replay attack, where the
adversary injects a previously recorded sample of the bio-
metric. Furthermore, with the current advance of machine
learning techniques, it is also possible to generate fake brain-
wave data using Generative Adversarial Networks [59]. In
this regard, if the authentication stimuli vary for each authen-
tication attempt (order, type), the elicited brain responses will
vary accordingly, but still provide the required user-speciﬁc
features. This type of challenge-response protocol, implies
that the attacker should be able to output results interactively
in real-time, as the stimuli are not known in advance, which
makes the attack harder to implement. Furthermore, an at-
tacker observing a user while authenticating learns nothing
about the brainwaves. Mimicry attacks, which are feasible for
other biometrics (voice, gait), are not applicable because the
adversary can not imitate non-volitional user responses.

The acquisition of EEG signals also raises privacy issues
because brainwaves correlate e.g., with our mental states, cog-
nitive abilities, and medical conditions [69]. An adversary
that controls the authentication stimuli, such as an honest-
but-curious authentication provider, could manipulate them
to infer private data. Martinovic et al. [44] demonstrated the
feasibility of this type of attacks. They successfully proved
that, by manipulating visual stimuli, EEG signals could re-
veal users’ private information about their bank cards, PIN
numbers, area of living, and if they knew a particular person.
Frank et al. [27] go even further, showing that it is possible
to extract private data from EEG recordings using subliminal
stimuli (short duration images embedded in visual content)
that cannot even be consciously detected by users.
With the potential wide adoption of BCI applications in our
everyday lives, security and privacy concerns are rising [9,13].
Our user study and other previous research [45] show that
users are concerned about ‘mind reading’, but some people are
already giving their brainwaves to third parties that offer brain-
controlled games or relaxation applications. It is therefore
paramount to research the security and privacy implications
of using brainwaves in computer systems and work to design
appropriate countermeasures before mainstream adoption.
7.3 Practical Implementation Aspects
Time to authenticate. A prototype implementation based on
the N400:Faces brainwave authentication algorithm would
require an initial enrollment phase. This means approximately
1 minute of brain data recording while the user looks at im-
ages in their PC. This phase could be extended to collect a
higher amount of samples for training the system and broken
into several shorter sessions for user convenience. It would
be useful to implement a sample quality detector to adapt the
duration of the enrollment process, similar to how ﬁngerprint
systems ask the user to place the ﬁnger in different angles
until enough data is gathered for successful operation. Next,
the authentication phase would require a minimum of 6 sec-
onds to authenticate the user, though this time will vary due
to the FRR. Fallback mechanisms should be implemented in
case the authentication does not succeed in a reasonable time.
Based on previous empirical research [75], the average time
to authenticate with 8-character random passwords is around
7.5 seconds (12.8-13.2 seconds in tablet/smartphones [75]).
Therefore, brainwave authentication is better in a best-case
execution. But even if it takes longer, it has to be considered
that usability perceptions can deviate from objective perfor-
mance measures. For example, research shows evidence that
graphical authentication schemes are perceived as more joy-
ful than passwords even if the login time may exceed that of
passwords [42,76]. In this sense, the N400:Faces is promising
given the positive ratings on enjoyability obtained in the user
study.
Extended Comparison. We use the framework of Bon-
neau et al. [14] to compare brainwave authentication against
passwords (the most common solution) and ﬁngerprint (the
most used biometric). Table 5 summarizes this comparison ac-
cording to the 25 criteria provided by the framework, grouped
in usability, deployability, and security beneﬁts. It can be seen
that brainwave authentication provides better usability than
passwords, and it could be comparable to that of ﬁngerprints
when FRR improves. On the security criteria, brainwaves
bring additional beneﬁts because they are not observable
and can not be mimicked. Targeted impersonation attacks
with synthetic or replayed data can be countered using the
challenge(stimulus)-response nature of the brainwave authen-
tication protocol. This allows the system to check response
freshness and whether reactions correspond to stimuli that are
meaningful for the legitimate user. Furthermore, as the adver-
sary would need to interact with a legitimate authentication
provider to obtain those per-user stimuli, we get resilience
to phishing. The main security challenge is to reduce the
FAR. Besides, brainwaves have the worst deployability ac-
cording to the framework criteria, though these criteria focus
on applicability to web authentication. Aspects like browser
compatibility could be addressed by implementing brainwave
authentication as part of the FIDO/WebAuthn protocols [77],
currently supported in modern browsers. Additionally, there
are other domains and use-cases outside the web realm where
brainwaves could become practical.
Use-cases. The proposed brainwave authentication system
was initially conceptualized for accessing PC applications,
but the visual stimuli can be easily adapted to other devices
and scenarios. Furthermore, once authenticated with the brain-
wave protocol, the user continues to have measurable brain
activity, which can be leveraged for continuous authentica-
tion while wearing the headset. Brainwaves can be practical
when users already wear an EEG reader for another applica-
tion and a keyboard is inconvenient/unavailable. For example,
authentication in Virtual Reality (VR) applications is still
challenging as passwords are clearly unpractical. But modern
VR headsets are introducing EEG sensors, making them a
perfect scenario to apply our mechanisms. Additionally, with
the ongoing miniaturization and integration of EEG sensors
in devices that people commonly use (e.g., earbuds), having
to carry them can be less problematic . Moreover, brainwaves
could be augmented with other sensors that collect implicit
biometrics (e.g., eye gaze) to improve authentication accuracy
and, therefore, increase security.
7.4 Limitations
We acquired brainwaves in a lab environment and during a
single recording session but we do not evaluate reliability and
robustness with regard to noise or changing conditions. Nev-
ertheless, based on previous research, we expect our system
