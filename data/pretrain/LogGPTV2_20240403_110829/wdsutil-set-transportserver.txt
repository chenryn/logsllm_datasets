Parameters
Parameter
Description
[/Server:]
Specifies the name of the Transport Server. This can be the NetBIOS name or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). If no Transport Server name is specified, the local server is used.
[/ObtainIpv4From:{Dhcp | Range}]
Sets the source of the IPv4 addresses as follows:-   [/start: ]  Sets the start of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/End: ]  Sets the end of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/startPort: ]  Sets the start of the port range.-   [/EndPort: ]  Sets the end of the port range.
[/ObtainIpv6From:Range]
Specifies the source of IPv6 addresses. This option only applies to Windows Server 2008 R2 and the only supported value is Range.-   [/start: ]  Sets the start of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/End: ]  Sets the end of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/startPort: ]  Sets the start of the port range.-   [/EndPort: ]  Sets the end of the port range.
[/Profile: {10Mbps | 100Mbps | 1Gbps | Custom}]
Specifies the network profile to be used. This option is only available for servers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003.
[/MulticastSessionPolicy]
Configures the transfer settings for multicast transmissions. This command is only available for Windows Server 2008 R2.-   [/Policy:{None | AutoDisconnect | Multistream}]  Determines how to handle slow clients. None means to keep all clients in one session at the same speed. AutoDisconnect means that any clients that drop below the specified /Threshold are disconnected. Multistream means clients will be separated into multiple sessions as specified by /StreamCount.-   [/Threshold:]  Sets the minimum transfer rate in KBps for /Policy:AutoDisconnect. Clients that drop below this rate are disconnected from multicast transmissions.-   [/StreamCount:{2 | 3}] [/Fallback:{Yes | No}]  Determines the number of sessions for /Policy:Multistream. 2 means two sessions (fast and slow), and 3 means three sessions (slow, medium, fast).-   [/Fallback:{Yes | No}]  Determines whether clients tha are disconnected will continue the transfer by using another method (if supported by the client). If you are using the WDS client, the computer will fall back to unicasting. Wdsmcast.exe does not support a fallback mechanism. This option also applies to clients that do not support Multistream. In that case, the computer will fall back to another method instead of moving to a slower transfer session.
-   [/start: ]  Sets the start of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/End: ]  Sets the end of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/startPort: ]  Sets the start of the port range.-   [/EndPort: ]  Sets the end of the port range.
-   [/start: ]  Sets the start of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/End: ]  Sets the end of the IP address range. This is required and valid only if this option is set to Range.-   [/startPort: ]  Sets the start of the port range.-   [/EndPort: ]  Sets the end of the port range.
-   [/Policy:{None | AutoDisconnect | Multistream}]  Determines how to handle slow clients. None means to keep all clients in one session at the same speed. AutoDisconnect means that any clients that drop below the specified /Threshold are disconnected. Multistream means clients will be separated into multiple sessions as specified by /StreamCount.-   [/Threshold:]  Sets the minimum transfer rate in KBps for /Policy:AutoDisconnect. Clients that drop below this rate are disconnected from multicast transmissions.-   [/StreamCount:{2 | 3}] [/Fallback:{Yes | No}]  Determines the number of sessions for /Policy:Multistream. 2 means two sessions (fast and slow), and 3 means three sessions (slow, medium, fast).-   [/Fallback:{Yes | No}]  Determines whether clients tha are disconnected will continue the transfer by using another method (if supported by the client). If you are using the WDS client, the computer will fall back to unicasting. Wdsmcast.exe does not support a fallback mechanism. This option also applies to clients that do not support Multistream.

Examples
To set the IPv4 address range for the server, type:
wdsutil /Set-TransportServer /ObtainIpv4From:Range /start:239.0.0.1 /End:239.0.0.100
To set the IPv4 address range, port range, and profile for the server, type:
wdsutil /Set-TransportServer /Server:MyWDSServer /ObtainIpv4From:Range /start:239.0.0.1 /End:239.0.0.100 /startPort:12000 /EndPort:50000 /Profile:10mbps
