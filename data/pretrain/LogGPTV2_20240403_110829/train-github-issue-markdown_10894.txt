Previously reported in #8855. Re-opening with reproducible example.
## Expected Behavior
Selecting MenuItem in Select component connected to redux-form sets redux-form
field value to MenuItem value.
## Current Behavior
Redux-form field value is briefly set to MenuItem value, but then is re-set to
`0`. I suspect the root cause is related to Select component's onBlur
propagating an `event.value.taget` of value `0` to the redux-form reducer.
Overriding onBlur in Select component results in expected behavior. The
current behavior appears to have been introduced in 1.0.0-beta.18.
