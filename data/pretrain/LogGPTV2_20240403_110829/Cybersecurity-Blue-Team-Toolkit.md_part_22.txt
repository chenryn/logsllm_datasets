school, we learned about Peter and the wolf. He was the little boy who
enjoyed the attention he received when he alerted everyone to a wolf
outside the village when one wasn\'t really there. After a while, no one
would pay attention to him. Eventually, he did have a confrontation with
the wolf and got eaten. Logs can have the same effect with their
alerting. If you have system administrators who are constantly bombarded
with a large number of alarms and alerts, they do become desensitized,
which can lead to longer response times or missing something important.
Lastly, consider having a roundtable discussion with all the
stakeholders in this process. Include your network administrators as
well as your security team. Decide what your retention policy should be,
whether it\'s dictated to you by an auditor because of your compliance
needs or your industry best practices. Retention policies that you put
in place will ensure that these messages will be there when you need
them. Utilize the scheduling tool inside Kiwi Syslog Server to take
advantage of automation. We are all busy with a focus on securing our
infrastructure, and forgetting to back up our files can have severe
consequences.

Software is developed to be the solution for a problem. Metasploit
Framework was developed by HD Moore in 2003 when he was only 22 years
old. Originally written in Perl with a total of 11 exploits, Metasploit
Framework was the answer to a problem he was having. He was spending
most of his time validating and sanitizing exploit code. I imagine that
for someone as brilliant as HD, this was redundant and boring. He knew
there must be an easier way. He couldn\'t get the project he had in mind
approved by the organization he worked for, so he decided to develop it
in his free time. Today, we use Metasploit Framework as a platform for
creating security tools and exploits, and there is a huge open‐source
community that supports the effort. In 2009, Rapid7 acquired the
project, and HD Moore joined the team as chief security officer.
Now Metasploit Framework is written in Ruby with many, many exploits. In
fact, at the time of this publishing, there are more than 3,700.
Metasploit Framework is the penetration testing tool of choice of blue
teamers and red teamers alike. Blue teamers are the good guys defending
the network against malicious intent. Red teamers are the malicious
intent. Red teamers are often called *penetration testers*, and they
enjoy proving where there are vulnerabilities that can be exploited. For
clarification, red teamers are very different than the
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_126 .pagebreak title="126"
role="doc-pagebreak"}criminals who use this tool for profit or
hacktivism. It is all about intent. In fact, as cybersecurity has
matured, there are some people, like me, who consider themselves to be
purple. A blend of red and blue, I can defend a network and then
periodically hack it as necessary to use this compromised viewpoint of
your network as a bad actor would.
Metasploit Framework is not a destination but a journey. That journey
begins before you even install the software. Before you get started, you
must know that the tools in this chapter are for your personal use on
your personal devices. These tools can be used in your business
environment only if you have secured permission to do so. Using any of
these tools to compromise machines that you do not own is illegal. You
must have documentation scoping the range of your penetration test
signed by the appropriate entities. This is not the type of scenario
where you pass your manager in the hallway and tell him you\'re about to
start this process. If something goes wrong and he doesn\'t remember the
conversation, it could be time to update your résumé and start looking
for a new job.
The U.S. federal government has some of the oldest and sometimes
problematic cybersecurity laws around the globe. The purpose of
cybersecurity regulation is to force companies to protect their systems
from cyberattacks like the ones you can create and distribute in
Metasploit Framework. Unless you have explicit and written permission to
access a computer network or system, do not do it. You must make sure
your documentation is correct and signed by the proper authority.
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes it illegal to intentionally
access a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization.
The original law was passed in 1984 as a reaction to a 1983 movie
starring Matthew Broderick called *War Games*. However, the law does not
define "without authorization" or "exceeds authorized access," which
makes it easy to prosecute and sometimes difficult to defend. The law
was crafted to crack down on hacking, and the repercussions can be
harsh. First‐time offenses of one singular incident of insufficient
authorization can result in 5 years in prison and fines.
One of my favorite organizations I have been lucky enough to work with
and take classes from is SANS. SANS is an organization of the
best‐of‐the‐best instructors teaching a variety of technical and
sometimes nontechnical classes. If you search for SANS documentation to
use as a template for your penetration test, you\'ll find a resources
download page that has everything from a Metasploit Framework cheat
sheet to a rules of engagement worksheet. Inside the scoping worksheet,
you will be asked to define security concerns, the scope of what should
be tested and not tested, and some type of escalation process should you
break something or find evidence of a prior exploit or a currently
active compromise.[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_127 .pagebreak title="127"

## Reconnaissance {#c10.xhtml#head-2-69}
Before you start this Metasploit journey, you have to do your homework.
After you have gained permission to legally explore a network, you need
to gain as much information about that network. This includes
information such as DNS, domains, ports, and services. Start a physical
or digital folder for this process. It makes life so much easier when
you have to create a report. It also works as a great resource when you
start expanding your reach deeper into a network. I use Microsoft
OneNote because it is so versatile and keeps everything together in a
single location.
Reconnaissance is gathering intelligence about an organization and can
take two forms: passive and active. Passive reconnaissance is done to
gather as much information as possible without any type of active
engagement. The information you gather will be used to attempt
successful exploitation of targets. The more information you learn, the
better crafted the attacks will be. Passive reconnaissance is completely
and totally legal. You can browse the company website just like you were
a typical user.
It amazes me how much information is shared on social media websites.
Professional social media websites are excellent places to discover
employees' names and possibly email structures. If you do decide to
conduct a social engineering campaign, it is helpful to know if the
employees email accounts are set up using a
`PI:EMAIL` structure.
You can visit the websites that most companies use to advertise the jobs
they currently have available. When you go to the technical positions
section, if organizations are looking for an Active Directory
administrator, you can surmise they are using Microsoft infrastructure.
If they are looking for someone with a CCNA certification, they are
using Cisco network devices. Sometimes organizations will get very
specific in their advertisements, and as a red teamer, if I know you\'re
looking for a DBA with Microsoft SQL experience, I know exactly what
exploit I will be using against you as soon as I get a foothold in your
environment. I mention this since I am making the assumption we are all
the good guys or "blue team"--- you can work with your human resources
department in crafting technical position listings as generically as
possible without compromising any company information.
The groundwork you lay when using all the passive reconnaissance will
make your penetration test that much smoother and give you strategic
options. Nothing you do in passive recon shows up in a security log or
an alert, and it cannot be traced back to your IP address. It is
completely legal and done every single day by good guys and bad guys
alike.
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_128 .pagebreak title="128"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Active reconnaissance involves doing something that
can be seen in a security log or an alert, and it can possibly be traced
back to you. This is why written permission (or a "Get Out of Jail Free
card" as it is sometimes called) is so incredibly important. You start
edging close to violating terms of service or even breaking the law when
you run a port scan or launch a vulnerability scan on assets you do not
personally own. Your goal with active reconnaissance is to build a
robust four‐dimensional picture of the environment you are concerned
with protecting. With active recon, if you can establish a possible a
point of entry and gain access, you know where to point your exploits
and establish persistence.

## Installation {#c10.xhtml#head-2-70}
You have many options when it comes to installing Metasploit. There is
the Metasploit Framework Open Source, the Framework for Linux or
Windows, Metasploit Community, and Metasploit Pro. When you navigate to
`www.metasploit.com`, there is a link on this Rapid7 site to
`github.com` where you can download either the Linux/Mac OS version or
the Windows 32‐bit version. These installers are rebuilt every single
night. These installers also include the dependent software needed like
Ruby and the PostgreSQL database that will manage all the information
you collect during a penetration test. It will integrate seamlessly with
the package manager, so they are easy to update on Linux.
Another option is to download a new operating system called Kali Linux.
Kali is an evolution of Debian Linux that is designed and maintained by
an organization called Offensive Security. Kali has more than 600
penetration testing programs, including Metasploit Framework as well as
some I have already covered in this book, such as Nmap and Wireshark. It
also has some tools yet to be covered in this book (like Burp, which is
covered in [Chapter 11](../Text/c11.xhtml)). Kali can run on bare metal
as an operating system on a hard drive, or you can boot from it on a USB
drive. The most popular way of running Kali is in a virtual environment.
I have done all of these, and my personal favorite is running it in a
virtual environment. The benefit of deploying Kali in a virtual machine
is the ability to take a snapshot. A snapshot is when you preserve the
state of a machine at a specific moment in time. It is cyber time travel
and a safeguard should you make a mistake. You are able to return to
that specific moment in time over and over again.
I covered Nmap in [Chapter 3](../Text/c03.xhtml), "Nmap: The Network
Mapper," and the Nexpose Community as a vulnerability scanner in
[Chapter 4](../Text/c04.xhtml), "OpenVAS: Vulnerability Management."
Both of these products give you data that can be imported into
Metasploit. In this chapter, I cover installing Metasploit Community on
a bare‐metal Windows machine. The two reasons we are going to be using
Metasploit Community are it is free and this is the GUI version.
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_129 .pagebreak title="129" role="doc-pagebreak"}As
security practitioners, we know that practice makes perfect. Once you
have Metasploit installed, you have an option of downloading vulnerable
systems from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) or Rapid7
to practice different types of exploitation. The Open Web Application
Security Project is a not‐for‐profit organization that focuses on
improving security in software. It has many different vulnerable machine
downloads so that you can explore exploiting different types of web
applications. In future labs and examples in this book, I will be using
a vulnerable system called Metasploitable2. Metasploitable2 was
purposefully crafted for training Metasploit and has many
vulnerabilities to experiment with.
In [Lab 10.1](#c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0001){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fea-0001},
you\'ll install Metasploit Community on a Windows system.

    are pen testing with Metasploit, it is best practice to use a
    dedicated asset if at all possible. Do not put Metasploit on a
    system that you use for personal email, social media, or any
    financial accounting. It is a bad idea to put QuickBooks financials
    on a machine you are hacking with. I mention this because I\'ve seen
    it.[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_130 .pagebreak title="130"
