## Abstract
The increasing popularity of online social networks (OSNs) has raised new security and privacy concerns. Most OSNs currently offer rudimentary access control mechanisms based on static access control lists (ACLs) or policies. However, as the number of social connections grows, these static approaches become ineffective and unappealing to users. There is a growing need for more sophisticated access control that considers the context (e.g., event, location, and participants) associated with the shared data, rather than just ownership and social connections.

Additionally, surveillance by service providers, who may scrutinize user data for targeted advertisements, corporate partnerships, or legal compliance, is another critical concern. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of context-based access control in OSNs, where users can access shared data only if they have knowledge of the associated context. We propose two constructions for context-based access control: one based on Shamir’s secret sharing scheme and the other using attribute-based encryption. We analyze the security properties of both constructions, implement proof-of-concept applications for Facebook, and empirically evaluate their functionality and performance. Our results show that the proposed constructions execute efficiently on standard computing hardware and portable mobile devices.

## I. Introduction

Online social networking (OSN) services are popular tools for users to connect with real-life acquaintances or individuals with similar interests. For instance, Facebook's user base had grown to one billion by the end of 2012 [1]. OSNs allow users to maintain profiles, update personal information, and share content such as pictures, posts, activities, events, and interests with others in their network. The privacy of this personal and shared information is a significant concern for OSN users [2].

To address privacy concerns, OSNs enforce access control policies on shared data, allowing only specific sets of users, as dictated by the policy, to view the information. Existing mechanisms are either based on static policies (e.g., all friends can view posted images by default) or fine-grained ACLs, where specific groups within a user's social network have access to certain categories of information [3]. These mechanisms are typically user-centric rather than data-centric.

A recent study [4] found that while most users take steps to mitigate privacy concerns from non-friends, 16.5% of participants had at least one post they were uncomfortable sharing with a specific friend, and 37% expressed general concerns about sharing content with friends. This suggests that current access control mechanisms, while effective against non-friends, are inadequate for addressing insider threats, where friends may become inappropriate audiences based on the context of a post.

We propose a new paradigm of dynamic access control in OSNs, called "social puzzles," which performs access control based on the context related to the shared data. Nearly all content on OSNs is associated with past, present, or future events, each with a unique context involving location, time, activities, participants, and preferences. Individuals involved in an event are presumed to have knowledge of the related context, making it suitable for context-based data sharing. This concept can also be applied to other data-sharing services like microblogging, photo sharing, and file storage.

Our goal is to design context-based access control mechanisms for OSNs that integrate seamlessly with existing platforms and provide resistance against surveillance by service providers. These mechanisms will complement existing static policies, offering users more flexibility and improving the privacy of shared data without compromising the utility of the OSN service. One advantage is that they simplify access control in undirected OSNs like Facebook and Google+, reducing the need for complex and constantly evolving ACLs. Additionally, directed OSNs with minimalistic access control, such as Twitter, will benefit from an added layer of privacy protection.

Access control in OSNs is often performed by the service provider or a trusted third-party, giving them access to the shared data and policies. This is undesirable for users who do not trust the service provider. Our proposed mechanism trusts the service provider only to execute the access control protocol honestly, without knowledge of the data or context. This surveillance-resistance property prevents service providers from mining user data for corporate gain or sharing it with other entities without user consent.

Another advantage is improved content relevance. With a large number of social contacts, users often receive irrelevant or sparsely relevant information. Good access control inherently leads to better content relevance. Context-based social routing [8] is another approach, where users specify their interests through keywords, and the data routing algorithm routes relevant content. Our mechanism ensures that users can only access content with familiar contexts, enforcing content relevance.

Finally, any new access control mechanism should be easy to use. A trivial context-aware access control scheme could involve generating a symmetric encryption key using the context, but this is impractical as receivers often lack full context knowledge. Our mechanisms are more flexible, allowing the sharer to specify a threshold of context knowledge required for access. Receivers can access data by proving partial context knowledge. Our goal is to design and implement mechanisms that incur low performance overhead, require minimal maintenance, and can be easily integrated with popular services like Facebook.

## Key Contributions
- **Proposed Constructions:** We propose two novel constructions for context-based access control to enable private data sharing among OSN users.
- **Feasibility Demonstration:** We demonstrate the feasibility of our constructions by developing a publicly-available proof-of-concept implementation for Facebook, including a security analysis under various adversarial scenarios.
- **Empirical Evaluation:** We empirically evaluate the functionality and performance of our implementation for a variety of operational parameters.

## II. Related Work
Different OSNs address data privacy and access control differently. Facebook, for example, provides customized ACLs, but these are not scalable for large, dynamic friend lists. Twitter, by contrast, has no privacy constraints, and all tweets are public by default. Some researchers have explored role-based and attribute-based access control in OSNs, but these require additional infrastructure and support from the OSN provider, making them less practical.

Our proposed mechanisms can be hosted by the OSN provider or a third-party, with much of the access control functionality performed locally on the client, making them more efficient. Many OSN providers have a "default open" policy, where sensitive information is easily accessible to other users. Security and privacy in OSNs have been extensively studied, but remain an open problem [13], [6], [14], [15], [16]. Research efforts have focused on decentralized OSNs, dedicated infrastructure, trusted third-party access control, and secure data sharing using public-key cryptography.

Yeung et al. [13] propose a decentralized approach where each user has a trusted server for data storage and access control. Diaspora and Vegas [10] are other decentralized OSNs, but they require dedicated infrastructure. Jagtap et al. [9] propose a data-on-demand list-based method, while Carminati et al. [17] suggest a semi-decentralized architecture. Our context-based access control mechanisms work with existing OSNs without additional hardware and are ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.

Some schemes use a trusted third-party for access control, but this still requires the third-party to have access to user data and policies. To ensure confidentiality, Beato et al. [14] use OpenPGP, but their scheme suffers from usability issues due to public-key management. FaceCloak [6] secures Facebook data using symmetric-key encryption, while Scramble! [15] uses asymmetric encryption and anonymizes user information. Both are not very user-friendly, requiring frequent key exchanges. Our mechanisms do not require periodic key exchanges and focus on access control based on context, not social connections. They are implemented in JavaScript, requiring only a standard web browser.

## III. Basics and Background
Before delving into the details, we briefly outline the cryptographic constructions used in our proposals. Our first construction employs Shamir’s secret sharing scheme, and the second uses an attribute-based encryption scheme like CP-ABE. Understanding bilinear maps and pairings is essential for CP-ABE.

### A. Bilinear Maps and Bilinear Pairing
Let \( G_0 \), \( G_1 \), and \( G_2 \) be multiplicative cyclic groups of prime order \( p \). Let \( g_0 \) and \( g_1 \) be generators of \( G_0 \) and \( G_1 \), respectively. Let \( e \) be a bilinear map from \( G_0 \times G_1 \) to \( G_2 \), i.e., \( e : G_0 \times G_1 \to G_2 \), such that for all \( u \in G_0 \), \( v \in G_1 \), and \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_p \), \( e(u^a, v^b) = e(u, v)^{ab} \) (bilinearity property) and \( e(g_0, g_1) \neq 1 \) (non-degeneracy property). If \( G_0 = G_1 \), the pairing \( e \) is symmetric because \( e(g_0^a, g_0^b) = e(g_0, g_0)^{ab} \).

### B. Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme
In Shamir’s \((k, n)\) threshold secret sharing scheme [18], a secret is divided into \( n \) shares, with each participant receiving a unique share. The secret can be reconstructed from any \( k \) shares. Suppose we want to share a secret \( s \) among \( n \) participants. We construct a polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree \( k-1 \) such that \( f(0) = s \). Each participant \( i \) receives \( f(i) \) as their share. The secret \( s \) can be reconstructed using Lagrange interpolation from any \( k \) shares.
