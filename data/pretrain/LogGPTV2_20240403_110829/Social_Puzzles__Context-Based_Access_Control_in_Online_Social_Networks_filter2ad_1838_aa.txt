Abstract—The increasing popularity of online social net-
works (OSNs) is spawning new security and privacy concerns.
Currently, a majority of OSNs offer very naive access control
mechanisms that are primarily based on static access control
lists (ACL) or policies. But as the number of social connections
grow, static ACL based approaches become ineffective and
unappealing to OSN users. There is an increased need in social-
networking and data-sharing applications to control access
to data based on the associated context (e.g., event, location,
and users involved), rather than solely on data ownership and
social connections. Surveillance is another critical concern for
OSN users, as the service provider may further scrutinize data
posted or shared by users for personal gains (e.g., targeted
advertisements), for use by corporate partners or to comply
with legal orders. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm
of context-based access control in OSNs, where users are able
to access the shared data only if they have knowledge of the
context associated with it. We propose two constructions for
context-based access control in OSNs: the ﬁrst is based on a
novel application of Shamir’s secret sharing scheme, whereas
the second makes use of an attribute-based encryption scheme.
For both constructions, we analyze their security properties,
implement proof-of-concept applications for Facebook and
empirically evaluate their functionality and performance. Our
empirical measurements show that the proposed constructions
execute efﬁciently on standard computing hardware, as well
as, on portable mobile devices.

I. INTRODUCTION
An online social networking (OSN) service is a popular
tool for online users to connect with other users who are
either real-life acquaintances or have similar interests and
background. The Wall Street Journal reported that Face-
book’s1 user base had increased to one billion users at the
end of 2012 [1]. OSN services allow its users to maintain
a proﬁle, update personal information and share pictures,
posts, activities, events, and interests with other users in
their social network. The privacy of personal and shared
information, with respect to the service provider and other
users, is of paramount importance to OSN users [2].
In order to provide privacy with respect to other users,
OSNs enforce access control policies on the data being
shared, wherein, only a speciﬁc set of receivers dictated by
the policy can get access to a user’s personal and shared
information. Existing OSN access control mechanisms are
1Facebook, https://www.facebook.com
based on either static policies (for example, by default all
users in the friend list are allowed to view all posted images)
or ﬁne-grained ACLs where speciﬁc groups within a user’s
social network are allowed access to speciﬁc categories of
the user’s information [3]. These access control mechanisms
are mostly user-centric, rather than information or data-
centric. In a recent study [4] of over 250 users, it was found
that while strangers or non-friends are the most concerning
audience when it comes to sharing data on Facebook, most
users take appropriate steps to mitigate those concerns.
However, 16.5% of the participants had at least one post
that they were uncomfortable sharing with a speciﬁc friend
- someone who likely already had the ability to view it - and
37% raised more general concerns with sharing their content
with friends. The study concludes that, although Facebook
privacy controls are effective against threat from non-friends,
they are unsuitable for the insider threat (i.e., from friends)
who dynamically become inappropriate audiences based on
the context of a post. Thus, there appears to be a need in
OSNs to dynamically share data based on the knowledge (or
context) related to the data being shared.
We envision a new paradigm of dynamic access control in
OSNs, called social puzzles, which performs access control
based on the knowledge of the shared data and the context
related to it. Nearly all content shared on OSNs is related to
past, present or future events, where each event is associated
with a unique context involving location, time, activities,
participants and preferences. Individuals involved in an event
are presumed to have gained knowledge of the related
context and some of this context may remain the same for
future similar events. This makes sharing data related to
events, of which the associated context is presumed to be
known by the intended audience, a suitable proposition. An
example of this includes sharing messages or pictures of
a past social gathering involving the target audience (who
are also friends on an OSN). The idea of context-based
data sharing is not only restricted to OSNs, but can also be
applied to other data sharing services such as microblogging
services (e.g., Tumblr), photo sharing services (e.g., Picasa
and Instagram) and ﬁle storage and sharing services (e.g.,
Dropbox and OneDrive). Other customized applications can
also be envisioned, e.g., data management in a corporate net-
work, where only employees knowing certain work-related
context can get access to certain conﬁdential documents.
Our goal in this work is to design access control mech-

anisms for OSNs using dynamic context-based policies,
which not only seamlessly integrate with existing OSNs,
but also provide resistance against surveillance by service
providers. These new access control mechanisms will com-
plement existing static policies on OSNs, thus providing
users with additional ﬂexibility while sharing data, and will
improve privacy of the shared data without compromising
the utility of the OSN service. One advantage of our
proposed mechanisms is that it will simplify the access
control process in undirected OSNs such as Facebook and
Google+2, especially when access control is required to be
based on the knowledge of the context surrounding the data.
In order to provide such an access control, service provider
and users will no longer be required to maintain complex
and constantly mutating and expanding access control lists
(ACL). Moreover, OSNs with directed social connections
and the ones that provide only very minimalistic access
control mechanisms (e.g., Twitter3) will beneﬁt even more
because the context-based access mechanism will add a layer
of privacy protection.
As access control in OSNs is currently either performed
by the service provider itself, or in some cases by a trusted
third-party [5], [6], [7], they typically have access to the
data being shared or the access control policy used to share
the data. This is not a desirable situation for users who do
not trust the service provider (or third-parties) and want
security against release of data or access control policies
to these parties. Our proposed access control mechanism
only trusts the service provider to execute the access control
protocol honestly; the service provider is able to perform
access control operations without
the knowledge of the
data being shared or the context based on which access
control
is done. Such a surveillance-resistance property
can prevent service providers from mining user data for
gaining corporate advantage (e.g., targeted advertisements)
or sharing it with other entities (e.g., government monitoring
programs and corporate partners) without user consent.
Another advantage of the proposed context-based access
control mechanisms is improved content-relevance. With an
increasingly large number of online social contacts, OSN
users typically ﬁnd themselves bombarded with or buried
under a large amount of irrelevant or sparsely relevant
information from their contacts. Good access control in-
herently leads to better content-relevance for OSN users.
Context-based social routing [8] is another effort in this
direction, where each user speciﬁes their interests through
a set of keywords and the data routing algorithm routes
shared objects with relevant context attributes to the users.
We argue that our context-based access control mechanism
will inevitably enforce relevant content being read, because
users cannot access contents with unfamiliar contexts.
Finally, we anticipate that any new access control mech-
anism should be easy to use, else users may continue to
settle for inferior privacy settings. A trivial context-aware
access control scheme can be constructed as follows: sharer
generates a symmetric encryption key (and then encrypts
data) by using all the context associated with the data, while
the receiver regenerates the key (to decrypt the data) by
proving knowledge of the entire context. However, such
a trivial scheme is not useful because most of the times
receivers will not be aware of the entire context related to
the shared data. The proposed mechanisms are much more
ﬂexible and allow the sharer to specify a threshold on the
number or amount of context required to be known by the
receivers before they can access the data. Thus, receivers can
access data by proving only partial knowledge of the related
context. We realize that when it comes to usability, systems
that require complex setup and regular maintenance [9], [10]
are not convenient and/or popular. Thus, our goal is to design
and implement mechanisms that
incur low performance
overhead, require little or no maintenance and can be easily
integrated with popular services such as Facebook.
The key contributions of this paper are as follows:
• We propose two novel constructions for context-based
access control to enable private data sharing among
OSN users.
• We demonstrate the feasibility of our constructions by
developing a publicly-available4 proof-of-concept im-
plementation for Facebook. A careful security analysis
under various adversarial scenarios is also performed.
• We empirically evaluate the functionality and perfor-
mance of our implementation for a variety of opera-
tional parameters.
II. RELATED WORK
Each OSN service addresses the problem of data privacy
and access control differently. Facebook, for example, pro-
vides customized ACLs where access to a particular data
object is restricted to only those social contacts that are
present in a user’s ACL. One shortcoming of ACLs is that
they are not very scalable. Increasingly large, and highly
dynamic, list of friends or social contacts can lead to a
burdensome maintenance of such access lists. In Twitter, on
the contrary, there are no privacy constraints and all tweets
are public (by default). Few other researchers have studied
the possibility of role-based [11] and attribute-based [12]
access control in OSNs. But both these schemes require
additional infrastructure and support from the OSN provider,
thus making them less likely to be adopted in practice.
Contrary to these, our proposed access control mechanisms
can be hosted either by the OSN provider or by some other
third-party provider. In our schemes, much of the access

control functionality is performed locally on the client on
an on-demand basis, which is more efﬁcient.
A majority of the OSN providers have a “default open”
policy, wherein a lot of sensitive and personal information
about subscribers is available or easily accessible by all other
subscribed users. Security and privacy of user data in OSNs
has received signiﬁcant attention in the literature, but it still
remains an open problem [13], [6], [14], [15], [16]. Existing
research efforts have primarily focused on: (a) decentralized
OSNs, (b) dedicated infrastructure at the end-user, (c) access
control by trusted third-party, and (d) secure data sharing
using public-key cryptography.
Yeung et al. [13] propose a decentralized approach to
online social networking where each user possesses a trusted
server which stores user-data and enforces pre-deﬁned ac-
cess control policies. Anyone trying to access a user’s
personal data is redirected to the trusted server which ﬁrst
makes an access control decision. Similarly, in order to view
protected shared objects in Diaspora5, friends would need to
access the user’s personal web server or start using the Dias-
pora service. D¨urr et al. [10] propose another decentralized
OSN, called Vegas, which allows secure information sharing
with nearby users. In another related effort, Jagtap et al.
[9] propose a data-on-demand list-based social networking
methodology which abstracts sensor data of mobile devices
by using a “Privacy Control Module” located on the user’s
device. Decentralized mechanisms, however, are not compat-
ible with existing OSN services and they require individual
users to possess dedicated infrastructure for data storage
and access control. Alternatively, a semi-decentralized ar-
chitecture proposed by Carminati et al. [17] reduces client-
side workload and infrastructure requirement, but it needs to
be continuously available. Compared to these, our context-
based access control mechanisms are designed to work
with existing OSN services, without requiring additional
hardware infrastructure and with limited resources (ideal
for resource-constrained mobile devices). To eliminate the
dependence on client-side infrastructure for access control, a
few of the above schemes propose the use of a trusted third-
party. Although the third-party can be trusted to perform
access control correctly, it still needs access to user’s policies
and data, which could open door to surveillance. In our
proposal, we also require a third-party (or OSN) to host the
context-based access control service, but our schemes are
resistant to surveillance by these providers or third-parties.
to guarantee conﬁdentiality against service
providers, data has to be encrypted at the client-side (by the
sharer) such that only the intended receiver(s) are able to
decrypt it. Beato et al. [14] achieve this by using OpenPGP.
The authors propose a scheme that is hybrid between the
trusted server and the decentralized approaches. Although
their implementation integrates well with existing OSNs,

the usability of their scheme suffers due to the required
public-key management operations. FaceCloak [6] secures
Facebook proﬁle data and messages by using symmetric-
key encryption and storing them on a separate server, while
posting fake information on the actual Facebook proﬁles.
Contrary to this, the scheme by Beato et al. [16] achieves
privacy by using asymmetric encryption and by anonymizing
user information from the shared data objects. Earlier, Beato
et al. [15] proposed a service provider-independent scheme,
called Scramble!, to assure conﬁdentiality and integrity of
OSN user data. The authors implement a browser extension
that allows users to enforce access control over their data,
as well as, protect it against surveillance and modiﬁcation
from service providers. Both FaceCloak and Scramble! are
not very easy to use because every friend has to actively
exchange and maintain a set of valid encryption/decryption
keys. In contrast, our mechanisms do not require periodic
and expensive key exchanges. Moreover, we address the
problem of access control based on the knowledge of the
shared data, and not based on the users in the social network.
Most importantly, due to its JavaScript-based implementa-
tion, only a standard web browser (without any additional
installation/conﬁguration) is required for using our scheme.
III. BASICS AND BACKGROUND
Before going into the details,
let us brieﬂy outline a
few well-known cryptographic constructions that we use
in our proposals. Our ﬁrst construction employs Shamir’s
secret sharing scheme (section III-B), whereas our second
construction uses an attributed-based encryption scheme
such as CP-ABE (section III-C). The mathematical notions
of bilinear maps and pairings (section III-A) are useful for
understanding CP-ABE.
A. Bilinear Maps and Bilinear Pairing
Let G0, G1 and G2 be multiplicative cyclic groups of
prime order p. Let g0 and g1 be generators of G0 and G1,
respectively. Let e be a bilinear map from G0 × G1 to G2,
i.e., e is a function e : G0 × G1 → G2, such that for all u ∈
G0, v ∈ G1 and a, b ∈ Zp, e(ua, vb) = e(u, v)ab (bilinearity
property) and e(g0, g1) (cid:4)= 1 (non-degeneracy property). If
G0 = G1, then the pairing e is symmetric. This is because,
e(ga
0) = e(g0, g0)a,b = e(gb
0 , gb
0, ga
0 ).
B. Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme
In Shamir’s (k, n) threshold secret sharing scheme [18],
a secret is shared among a set of, say n, participants by
dividing it into parts (or shares) such that each participant
possesses a unique share. The secret can then be recon-
structed from a threshold, say k, number of shares obtained
from the participants. Let’s assume that we want to share a
