### Analysis of Ring Sizes and Containment Effectiveness

Table 2 presents the sizes of rings at various depths around different wardens, along with the fraction of ASes external to each warden that are not reachable via at least one clean path. A ring at a depth of one is the smallest effective ring, comprising 161 ASes. The next ring, at a depth of two, increases in size by more than a factor of 23, making it impractically large. The ring at a depth of three is smaller due to the definition of ring membership by minimum depth. However, if containment is not achieved at a depth of two, the majority of the Internet becomes reachable.

While the depth one ring may seem promising, it is important to note that it consists of ASes that have chosen to directly conduct business with the warden. Providing sufficient economic incentives for these ASes to act against their customers' wishes can be challenging, especially since the warden can also offer incentives to avoid deploying decoy routers.

A depth one ring is difficult to implement for economic reasons, and a depth three ring does not provide adequate containment. Therefore, a depth two ring appears to be the only feasible option. However, the depth two ring around China, for example, includes 3,806 ASes, which is too large for a successful deployment. Even the smallest depth two ring, around Syria, contains 751 ASes.

### Fractional Deployment to Depth Two Rings

We used our previous simulator to explore the success of a fractional deployment to the depth two rings. The results, shown in Figure 10, indicate that to cut off Egypt, Iran, and Syria from half of the Internet, more than 70% of the depth two ring needs to deploy decoy routers. For China, this figure exceeds 80%.

### Alternative Strategies: Ringing Popular Destinations and Geographic Locations

An alternative strategy would be to ring popular destinations, such as those listed in the Alexa top 100. This approach faces similar challenges as the depth one ring: it requires directly incentivizing entities to act against their economic interests. Content providers and ISPs have little to gain and much to lose by participating in such a scheme, making it economically unviable.

Another alternative is to ring a geographic location with decoy routers. If connectivity to this region is critical, this can be defeated by tunneling TLS traffic. The warden can rent or construct a small data center inside the ringed location, where all TLS connections bound for the region are placed in an IPsec tunnel. This method thwarts decoy routing systems by adding an additional layer of encryption to the packets.

### Timing and Traffic Shaping

To prevent traffic analysis, Wustrow et al. [27] suggest using traffic shaping to mimic the characteristics of a TLS connection. While this may prevent traditional traffic analysis, it is less effective against timing analysis. Discrepancies in network latencies, caused by differences in AS-level paths, make it difficult for decoy routers to mask the latency. The only way to hide this side channel is to ensure that the overt and covert destinations have statistically similar latencies.

However, this introduces additional problems. First, clients need to broadcast to many different overt destinations to increase the likelihood of crossing a decoy router, which can be problematic. Second, linking the choice of overt destination to the covert destination reduces the anonymity of the covert destination. Finally, for many covert destinations, there may not be any appropriate overt destination within the same distance from a decoy router, making such destinations effectively unreachable.

### Related Work

Previous studies have explored the impact of ISP-type adversaries on anonymity schemes. Feamster and Dingledine [12] analyzed the diversity of AS-level paths in anonymity networks and showed how path asymmetry can lead to poor location independence. Edman and Syverson [11] demonstrated that even with the growth of the Tor network, AS path diversity remains a challenge. Murdoch et al. [21] highlighted that even with high AS-level diversity, many packets travel through a single physical Internet exchange, allowing a single entity to perform traffic analysis.

Research on timing attacks has shown that traffic analysis techniques, particularly latency measurements, can be used to fingerprint nodes in the network [5]. Hopper et al. [17] provided a formal framework for how an adversary can use latency measurements in the Tor network to reduce client anonymity. Several papers [22, 16, 10, 15] have shown that more sophisticated fingerprinting methods can be used to identify the end server in the Tor network, potentially combined with timing attacks for more accurate identification.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced a new adversary model for decoy routing, the routing-capable adversary, and explored the implications for decoy routing. We showed how wardens can enumerate deployed decoy routers and route around them, and we analyzed the effects of different deployment strategies. We also demonstrated how wardens can use confirmation attacks to detect client participation and fingerprinting techniques to expose the identity of covert destinations. These results indicate that small deployments can be easily defeated, requiring larger deployments for decoy routing to be successful. However, some confirmation attacks still work against large deployments, suggesting that new ideas are needed for secure and cost-effective decoy routing.
