Question: "In reviewing the security posture of a web application, you are evaluating the use of logging as an intrusion detection mechanism. Which of the following points would you raise as potential weaknesses in relying solely on logging?"
 "A": "Logging ensures the immediate blocking of suspicious activities, thereby preventing potential damage."
 "B": "Logs may not capture the full scope of an attack if the attacker uses evasion techniques that are not accounted for in the logging system."
 "C": "Logging cannot provide insights into the system's behavior before or during an attack as it only records events after they have occurred."
 "D": "The implementation of logging significantly reduces the web server's performance due to the high computational overhead."
Answer: BC
