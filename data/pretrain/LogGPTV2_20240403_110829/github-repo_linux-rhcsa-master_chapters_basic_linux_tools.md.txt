## Basic Linux Tools
#### SSH
We can ssh from another Linux system with the hostname or IP address with either of:
```bash
ssh -l user1 {ip address}
ssh user1@{ip address}
```
#### Documentation
We can see the usage of a command in a number of ways:
```bash
# see the man pages for a command 
man mkdir
# search the installed manual pages 
man -k password
# if new packages are install update the man pages using
mandb
# see a short description of the specific command
whatis ls
# search man pages and key words
apropos log
```
The `/usr/share/doc` directory stores documentation for all installed packages under sub-directories. This has a lot of information about the packages.
```bash
ll -d /usr/share/doc/sudo*
```
#### Directories
```bash
# list files and directories
ls
# ll is an alias of ls -l
type ll
#ll is aliased to `ls -l --color=auto'
# shows the working directory
pwd
# change directory
cd 
# make a directory
mkdir -v new1
# go up a directory to the parent
cd ..
```
#### Users
```bash
# Display the terminal name we are logged on to
tty
# list the users currently logged into the system
who
# list the information for only the user running the command
who am i
# the what command gives more information than the who command
w
# show the systems current time and low long it has been up for
uptime
# name of the real use who logged into the system
logname
# display user and gruop name information for the user
id
# list all the groups a user is a member of 
groups
# view successful login attemps
last
# view history of failed user login attemps
lastb
# see recent user logings
lastlog
```
#### System Information
```bash
# see basic info about the system & kernel
uname -a
# see DMI table contents
dmidecode > /root/dmidecode.txt
# view the hostname 
hostnamectl
# change hostname
hostnamectl set-hostname host1.example.com 
# display and set system date and time
timedatectl
timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Dublin
# set the date
date --set "2019-11-01 12:00:00"
# see the path the command will execute if run with absolute path
which cat
# count number lines, words and characters
wc /etc/profile
# see information about PCI buses and devices connected
lspci -m 
# see information about USB buses and devices connected
lsusb
# see info about the processor
lscpu
# see the calendar
cal 2020
# see the difference between two files
diff /etc/passwd /root/passwd1
```
#### Compression Tools
Compression tools are used to save space, encoding the information in fewer bit than the original information.
```bash
# gzip creates a compressed file of each of the files
gzip /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
# unzip the file
gunzip /root/anaconda-ks.cfg 
# bzip2 & bunzip2 can also be used
bzip2 file.things
# combine find to compress files
nohup find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +30 -iname "*[0-9]*" -exec gzip {} \; &
```
Zip is another format for archiva/compression. Mostly used for files that need to be managed on windows/Linux. 
```bash
zip -r archivenamne /home
unzip archivename
```
An archive is a file that is a collection of a number of files/directories that can be sorted easiers than its components.
Archiving tools include tar and star which have the ability to preserve general file attributes (ownership, group membership). Tar stands for an was originally used for "Tape Archive".
```bash
# Create a tarball of the entire /home directory
tar cvf /tmp/home.tar /home
# to restore /home from home.tar
tar xvf /tmp/home.tar
# copy mutiple files
tar cvf /tmp/files.tar file1 file2
# see contents of tar
tar tvf files.tar
# restore the files
tar xvf files.tar
# make a tar and compress with gzip
tar cvzf files.tar.gz /vagrant/
# also preserve selinux and attributes and compress with bzip2
tar cvj --selinux --xattrs -f /tmp/file.tar.bz2 /home
```
The star command is an enhanced version of tar. 
```bash
# create a tarball containing entire /etc directory with all extended file attributes and SELinux file context
star cvf /tmp/etc.tar -xattr -H=exustar /etc
```
Copy files from another server:
```bash
# tar files 
sudo tar cvzf ~luke.morson/kafka01.tar.gz $(ls -1)
# check contents
tar tvf kafka01.tar.gz
# chown ownership
sudo chown luke.morson:
scp kafka01:/home/luke.morson ~/Desktop/kafka01
```
#### vi
The vi editor is a text editing tool that allows you to create and modify text files. There's a multitude of options with vi to explore.
```bash
# create a new file using vi
vi new_file
# exit and save using 
esc + :wq
# write changes into a new file called file2
:w file2
# exit if modifications were made, but we do not wish to save them
:q!
```
#### Shutdown
```bash
# shutdown the system in 10 minutes and notify users
shutdown +10 {message}
# reboot the machine 
shutdown -r now
systemctl reboot
# ways to shutdown the machine
shutdown +0
init 0
systemctl halt
systemctl poweroff
```
#### Cockpit
Cockpit is a web-based interface for administering servers.
```bash
sudo yum install cockpit cockpit-dashboard
# allow connections if needed
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9090/tcp
# enable cockpit
systemctl enable cockpit.socket --now
# navigate to the following URL in the browser
localhost:9090
```
