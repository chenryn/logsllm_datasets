### Distinguishing Between Different IoT Products

We can distinguish between different products from a single manufacturer, such as Samsung TVs and Amazon Echo devices. For product-level detection, side information about the purpose of the associated domains is crucial. This information enhances our classification accuracy. For example, for Alexa-enabled devices, the domain `avs-alexa.*.amazon.com` is essential, as it serves as the base URL for the Alexa Voice Service API [13] (see Figure 8, labeled as `amazon domain23`). Similarly, Samsung devices use the domain `samsungotn.net` to check for firmware updates [25].

Additionally, advanced services often require additional backend support from manufacturers, leading to contact with more specific domains. By considering these specialized features, we can better distinguish between products. For instance, Amazon Fire TV contacts significantly more domains than other Amazon products like the Echo Dot.

### Generation of Detection Rules

For each level of detection—platform, manufacturer, and product—we require that a subscriber contacts at least one IP/port combination associated with a primary domain of the IoT service. However, if multiple domains are involved, relying on a single activity may not provide sufficient evidence. For example, monitoring a single domain can detect all Alexa-enabled devices, but this service can also be integrated into third-party hardware. Therefore, to specifically detect Amazon-manufactured products like the Amazon Echo, it is necessary to monitor additional domains.

To address this, we introduce a detection threshold \( D \). If an IoT service has \( N \) IoT-specific domains, we require observing traffic involving \( k \) IP/port combinations associated with \( \max(1, \lfloor D \times N \rfloor) \) of the \( N \) domains. The appropriate value for this threshold is determined using our ground truth dataset, as described in Section 5.

### Testbed and Device Deployment

Our testbed initially includes 96 devices, with multiple copies of the same device deployed across different continents. This reduces the set to 56 unique products. Many of these devices are from the same manufacturer, such as Xiaomi rice cookers, plugs, and light bulbs. Since these devices often share the same backend infrastructure, their list of domains overlaps significantly or even completely.

Using our methodology, we can detect three different IoT platforms at the coarsest level, as four of our products rely on them. We have generated rules for detecting 29 IoT devices at the manufacturer level. Our testbed includes a diverse range of products from Amazon and Samsung, allowing for in-depth analysis and cross-examination of the domains contacted by different products.

For Alexa-enabled devices and Samsung IoT devices, we can detect the former at the platform level and the latter at the manufacturer level. By comparing the domains across different devices and using side information about their purposes, we further divide these into two subclasses at finer-grained levels. For example, under Alexa-enabled devices, we define a hierarchy: Amazon products (detected at the manufacturer level) and Fire TV (detected at the product level). We identified 33 additional domains, besides the Alexa voice service domain, contacted by Amazon products. Fire TV contacts up to 67 domains, which allows us to establish it as a subclass at the product level under Amazon products.

For Samsung IoT devices, we monitor 14 domains in total, but only one domain is critical for detecting Samsung firmware. Samsung TVs contact 16 additional domains not used by other Samsung devices in our testbed.

### Detection Rule Generation

Using the above methodology, we generated detection rules at different levels for our testbed devices. We generated rules for 20 manufacturers and 11 products, covering 77% of the manufacturers in our testbed. We also generated rules for 4 unique IoT platforms by monitoring 1 to 4 domains. For 11 products, we consider between 1 to 67 domains. See Figure 10 for a detailed breakdown of the number of domains per IoT device.

### Methodology: Crosscheck

We use our ground truth dataset to evaluate how long it takes for our methodology to detect the presence of IoT devices in both active and idle modes. On average, by requiring evidence of at least 40% of the domains, we can detect 72/93/96% of IoT devices at the manufacturer or product level within 1/24/72 hours in active mode. In idle mode, the percentages are 40/73/76% within the same time frames. For devices detectable only at the product level, we detected 63/81/90% within 1/24/72 hours, respectively, in active mode.

Popular products like Amazon Echo Dot and Echo Spot can be almost instantly detected. This finding highlights the potential of using sampled flow data within an ISP to accurately detect the presence of specific IoT products, despite differences in activity and IP churn due to operational requirements.

### Ethical Considerations and Privacy Implications

Applying our methodology to traffic data from ISPs and IXPs raises ethical concerns, as it involves analyzing customer activities. However, our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and mapping IoT device usage, not to trace individual activities. The raw data is anonymized, and we do not analyze any data unrelated to IoT detection, such as DNS queries or non-IoT-related flows, to avoid user web visit profiling.

### Vantage Point: ISP

Figure 11 shows the number of ISP subscriber lines where we detect IoT-related activity. The ISP does not operate a carrier-grade NAT, so even if multiple IoT devices are hosted at a subscriber, we count the hosting subscriber only once. Thus, the number of subscribers hosting a given IoT device is a lower bound for the number of that device in the premises of ISP subscribers.

Figures 11(a) and 11(b) focus on hourly and daily summaries. The top IoT devices detected are Alexa-enabled and Samsung IoT devices. We see IoT-related activity for roughly 20% of the subscriber lines. Our results show a significant penetration of Alexa-enabled devices, around 14%, slightly higher than national survey estimates of 12% as of June 2019 [27–29]. These reports cannot capture active use, unlike our study.

### Daily Patterns of IoT-Related Activity

The hourly plots in Figure 11(a) show significant daily patterns for Alexa-enabled and Samsung IoT devices. We do not see diurnal patterns for the other 32 IoT device types. Diurnal patterns are correlated with human activities, with network activity increasing during the day and decreasing at night. The patterns for Alexa-enabled devices are similar to those for Samsung IoT devices, likely because they are used for entertainment, with activity peaking in the evenings. Samsung IoT devices show a small spike in the mornings before reaching a peak around 18:00 (ISP timezone).

For a detailed drill-down of Samsung IoT devices, see Figure 12. Despite diurnal variations, there is a significant baseline of activity during the night, as IoT devices often generate traffic even when idle. The low variance in the observed number of subscriber lines for Alexa-enabled devices reflects the relatively low diurnal variation compared to typical network activity driven by human activity.
