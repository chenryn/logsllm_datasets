cases where we had exactly 3 tweets, it was important to
set a very high threshold. So, we set a threshold of 100%,
implying all 3 source tweets had to have the keyword in
question. For proﬁles with more than three but less than
10 tweets, we required that at least 50% of the tweets had
to have the keyword. Further, for cases when we had more
than 10 but less than 20 tweets, we relaxed the threshold to
40%. Finally, when more than 20 tweets were available, we
required that at least 30% should have the keyword.
Of the 2,969 spam proﬁles that used reply tweets, 2,419
(81.4%) had at least three reply tweets each. Of these, 1,004
(41.5%) passed the heuristic to ﬁt this strategy. Further,
710 of these proﬁles had at least 10 tweets with links and
at least 80% of their links were going to a single domain,
implying that these spam proﬁles were likely running cam-
paigns. The most popular domain was jbet.info, which in-
volved 173 proﬁles that were promoting this health-related
website using keywords “breakfast”, “lunch”, and “dinner” to
locate targets. The next most popular, hellojb.info, was
also caught in Section 4.2 since the spammer was targeting
the followers of celebrity Justin Bieber. It was caught here
due to the presence of keyword “justinbieber” in the tweets
of targets and the proﬁles involved in both cases were the
same set. Finally, the Amazon aﬃliate marketing campaign
featured prominently in this category as well. We saw six dif-
ferent campaigns using a diverse range of keywords, ranging
from “buy”, “iPhone”, “weight”, “aging”, and “jailbreak” (see
Table 5). The largest two campaigns involving 73 and 19
spam proﬁles respectively, had three and one proﬁles com-
mon with Amazon campaigns found in Section 4.2. Also,
campaign 4, involving three spam proﬁles, shared a proﬁle
with Section 4.2. A closer inspection of the common proﬁles
suggests that the spammers simply targeted keywords and
got followers of speciﬁc popular proﬁles as a result.

Spam Proﬁles Binned
4.3.1
A total of 1,004 spam proﬁles were binned under this strat-
egy. Of these, only one was found in Section 4.1 while 210
proﬁles were found in Section 4.2. Of the latter, 150 were
simply due to the hellojb.info campaign discussed earlier.
Overall, thus far, we have binned 8,274 (58.1%) of the 14,230
proﬁles of successful spammers.
4.4 Trending Topics Hijacking
Twitter users can tag their tweets with a topic by using
a keyword after the symbol ’#’. This keyword is referred
to as a hashtag in Twitter parlance. Popular hashtags be-
come trending topics, which attract visibility. Spammers
have been known to hijack trending topics to increase the
visibility of their spam campaigns [16]. Here, we examine
how many of the successful spammers in our data set are
exploiting this strategy. Note that spammers can make use
of this strategy in conjunction with other spamming strate-
gies, such as spamming their own followers or followers of
popular proﬁles.
A spammer using this strategy may use any of the various
types of tweets, regular, mentions, or replies so long as the
tweet contains a hashtag. We analyzed the 4,327 spam pro-
ﬁles in our data set that had at least one hashtag in their
tweets. In order to identify spammers who tried to hijack
trending topics, we pre-calculated a set of 200 most popular
hashtags out of the total 466,597 hashtags present in the
tweets in our data set. Next, just like in Section 4.3, we re-
quired that each spammer proﬁle have a minimum of three
tweets with hashtags. This ruled out 824 proﬁles leaving
us with 3,503 (81%) proﬁles to examine. On each proﬁle,
we applied the same slabs as we applied to determine key-
words in Section 4.3 to determine whether or not it abused
a popular hashtag for spam distribution.
Our heuristic concluded that 1,043 spam proﬁles hijacked
trending topics. Of these, 174 likely ran a campaign since
they led their targets to a speciﬁc domain as they had at
least 10 hashtag tweets with links and 80% of their tweets
pointed to a particular domain. The top campaigns used
fewer proﬁles and proportionally fewer tweets compared to
those found in Section 4.3 and were promoting politically-
oriented, gaming-related and various kinds of unsavory web-
sites. Two domains in these campaigns were the most in-
teresting. The ﬁrst was the Amazon aﬃliate ID campaign,
which was found in all previous sections. Here, we found
ﬁve spam campaigns (shown in Table 6). All but one cam-
paign were already identiﬁed in Section 4.1, indicating that
spammers simply tried to cast their net wide. The second
interesting domain was adf.ly, where 19 spam proﬁles were
hijacking trending topics to advertise this ad-based short-
ener. Such shorteners were observed by Thomas et al. also.
The revenue model for these shorteners is to show advertise-
ments before leading the visitor to the destination link.

Spam Proﬁles Binned
4.4.1
Given that this strategy merely requires the addition of
an extra hashtag to a spam tweet, it can be easily combined
with other strategies. Hence, we see signiﬁcant commonal-
ity between proﬁles binned under this strategy and others
discussed before. Speciﬁcally, we found that 523 of the 1,044
proﬁles binned under this strategy were using regular tweets
to spam their followers (discussed in 4.1). Another 14 pro-
ﬁles were common with Section 4.2. Finally, three proﬁles
394
were common with those in Section 4.3. Overall, this strat-
egy binned 503 new spam proﬁles not binned through pre-
vious strategies, bringing the total binned proﬁles to 8,777
(61.7%) of the 14,230 proﬁles of successful spammers.
4.5 Targeting Own Followers by Retweets
We saw in Section 4.1 that regular tweets are a popular
way for spammers to target their followers. Retweets can
be used as an alternative because they also reach ones fol-
lowers, except that they are restrictive because the tweet
content has to be borrowed verbatim from another tweet
and cannot be modiﬁed. However, according to the Twee-
tAttacks software, retweets have a higher click rate than
normal tweets, which may make spammers prefer them. In
fact, TweetAttacks referred to the strategy of using retweets
as “retweet attacks”.
Retweets were the least popular among spammers as well
as other users, with successful spammers using them even
lesser than others (see Table 1). 1,230 successful spam pro-
ﬁles used retweets at all. Of these, only 70 had greater than
10 retweets with links and only 28 had 80% of their links
pointing to a single domain, suggesting that they were run-
ning campaigns. Incidentally, each of these 28 were using
retweets exclusively. 26 of them were retweeting content
from a Twitter proﬁle called omgwire. The proﬁle seemed
to be promoting a celebrity gossip website, omgwire.com,
so the retweets were tailored to that promotion. The other
two domains were also retweeting content from two separate
Twitter proﬁles and promoting a website each.
4.5.1
This strategy only helped bin 28 additional spam proﬁles
but none were common with those found under previous
strategies. Overall, we have thus far binned 8,805 (61.9%)
spam proﬁles of the total 14,230 proﬁles of successful spam-
mers.

5. POSTING METHODOLOGY
Figure 4: Examining the “via” ﬁeld at the bottom
of a tweet helps determine how it was posted
395
Twitter allows posting tweets using a variety of method-
ologies, including their Web interface and various Twitter-
provided and third party clients which post through the
Twitter API. Examples of such clients include Tweet But-
ton, Twitter’s mobile interface, and specialized applications
for various smartphone platforms, such as BlackBerry, iPhone,
and Android. Additionally, there are RSS-to-tweet services
such as twitterfeed,dlvr.it and Google’s client for the users
of their blog service,blogspot.com that automatically post a
link to Twitter account each time a new content is published
on a blog.
Twitter facilitates knowing how a tweet was posted. For
example, the bottom of the tweet shown in Figure 4, which
is one of the spam tweets from the Amazon campaign dis-
cussed throughout Section 4, shows that it was posted via
Twitterfeed, a third-party client.
Looking into how successful and unsuccessful spam pro-
ﬁles diﬀer in their posting behavior versus other users helped
draw interesting conclusions which we present next. Ta-
ble 7 shows the top six most popular ways of posting, based
on the number of tweets posted and the number of proﬁles
that make use of it. We ﬁnd that Twitterfeed is the most
popular among spam proﬁles, with successful ones exploit-
ing it for 2/3rd of their tweets. The Web is popular among
all three groups, with close to 40% of the proﬁles in each
group posting via the Web. Note that popular software, such
as TweetAdder and TweetAttacks, automate their posts so
they appear to have been posted via the Twitter Web inter-
face. Twitter’s mobile Web interface, which is the version
of Twitter.com for mobile devices, is popular among unsuc-
cessful spammers but not among successful spammers and
other users.
Also, there is evidence of spammers using fewer dedicated
apps when compared to other users as shown in Table 8.
The average suggests that the organic proﬁles use several
diﬀerent apps, where as spammers (successful or unsuccess-
ful) have fewer dedicated apps.These ﬁndings indicate that
the method of posting tweets itself could be used to predict
if a tweet is more likely to be spam versus good.

6. DISCUSSION
In the previous sections, we discussed how successful spam
proﬁles ﬁnd their targets and what tools are often associ-
ated with spam accounts.
In this section, we discuss two
additional aspects of our study. First, we look at the set
of successful spam accounts which were not accounted for
in any of the strategies described in Section 4. We discuss
what strategies may have been missed and oﬀer explanations
based on limitations in our dataset to discover such proﬁles.
Next, we discuss the concept of gathering followers. As was
shown in 4.1, a large number of successful spammers have a
signiﬁcant number of followers. We brieﬂy investigate what
methods are used by spam accounts to gather followers and
remark upon two major types of follower gathering schemes.
