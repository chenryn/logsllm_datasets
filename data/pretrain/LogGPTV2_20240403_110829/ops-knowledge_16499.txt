User: Is there a way to call allureCLI from Python? I would like to use python instead than shell scripting to run multiple reports.
I could use Popen but I am having so many issues with it, that I would rather avoid it unless there is no other way around
Assistant: Since the Allure CLI script calls a java application makes it a Python to Java problem. There are a few solutions like Py4J that can help you with that. Keep in mind that most solutions rely on the Java app already running inside the secondary application before being called from Python.
