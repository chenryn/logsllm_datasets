Assistant: This log chunk shows the system running tasks 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 0.0 in stage 9.0. It also shows the system reading broadcast variable 18, storing blocks in memory, and calculating times for the PythonRunner. Finally, it shows that task 0.0 has been completed and the result sent to the driver.
