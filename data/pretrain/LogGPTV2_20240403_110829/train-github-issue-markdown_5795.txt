 **Glide Version** : 3.8.0-SNAPSHOT
**Device/Android Version** : Nexus 5, 5.0.1
I'm using a `PaletteBitmapTranscoder` to generate a palette, as demonstrated
in the Custom targets section of the Glide wiki.
However, when using `.thumbnail()` in cases where the thumbnail request
finishes after the full request, it ends up using the palette that was
generated for the thumbnail instead of the full image.
Since `Palette` generates very different color swatches as an image is
resized, this can affect the results.
In my test, the thumbnail palette always gets used the first time the image is
loaded, but the full image's palette is used for all subsequent loads. (I
think that if the full request is in the cache, the thumbnail does not get
generated?)
Is there a way to prevent transcoding of the thumbnail when using a transcoder
for the full image request?
I've tried changing the order of where `.thumbnail()` is called when building
the request, but didn't have any luck with that approach. Most of those
attempts wouldn't compile because of type incompatibility, e.g. not having a
compatible `TranscodeType` with the full request.
I also tried using an explicit thumbnail request with its own settings but
that didn't work; the full request's resource transcoder still gets called for
the thumbnail. Giving the thumbnail its own `PalletteBitmapNullTranscoder`
that doesn't generate a palette didn't work either; it just resulted in
additional `transcode()` calls (and additional `DecodeJobs` in the log
output). The additional `transcode()` calls did what I wanted (namely, not
generating a palette) but it didn't replace the original thumbnail
`transcode()` call that I was trying to override.
At this point I've disabled thumbnail generation when using a
PaletteBitmapTranscoder, but I'm still new to Glide so I wonder if there might
be something obvious that I might be missing.
For instance, is there any way to create a thumbnail request that uses a
different `TranscodeType`, or a different `ModelType` for that matter?
Or is there some way within a `ResourceTranscoder` to know whether
`transcode()` is being called for the full request or the thumbnail request?
