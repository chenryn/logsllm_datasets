ABSTRACT
Critical infrastructure such as the power grid has become increas-
ingly complex. The addition of computing elements to traditional
physical components increases complexity and hampers insight
into how elements in the system interact with each other. The re-
sult is an infrastructure where operational mistakes, some of which
cannot be distinguished from attacks, are more difﬁcult to prevent
and have greater potential impact, such as leaking sensitive infor-
mation to the operator or attacker. In this paper, we present CPAC,
a cyber-physical access control solution to manage complexity and
mitigate threats in cyber-physical environments, with a focus on
the electrical smart grid. CPAC uses information ﬂow analysis
based on mathematical models of the physical grid to generate poli-
cies enforced through veriﬁable logic. At the device side, CPAC
combines symbolic execution with lightweight dynamic execution
monitoring to allow non-intrusive taint analysis on programmable
logic controllers in realtime. These components work together to
provide a realtime view of all system elements, and allow for more
robust and ﬁner-grained protections than any previous solution to
securing the grid. We implement a prototype of CPAC using Bach-
mann PLCs and evaluate several real-world incidents that demon-
strate its scalability and effectiveness. The policy checking for a
nation-wide grid is less than 150 ms, faster than existing solutions.
We additionally show that CPAC can analyze potential component
failures for arbitrary component failures, far beyond the capabili-
ties of currently deployed systems. CPAC thus provides a solution
to secure the modern smart grid from operator mistakes or insider
attacks, maintain operational privacy, and support N−x contingen-
cies.
INTRODUCTION
1.
Critical national infrastructure has become increasingly com-
plex. For decades, systems such as the power grid were com-
prised solely of physical, mechanical components that could be
reasoned about using classical physics. However, as computing has
become increasingly miniaturized and ubiquitous, adding computa-
tional resources into these environments becomes not just feasible,
but practical and beneﬁcial. In the case of the power grid, adding
computing elements allows for essential capabilities such as state
estimation (i.e., understanding where the power in a grid is ﬂow-

ing at any given time) and contingency analysis (i.e., determining
whether the grid is resilient to the failure of components within it).
The grid exempliﬁes a cyber-physical infrastructure, with data col-
lected from its physical components and processed by algorithms
running on computers to provide for accurate and safe monitoring
and control. To realize this, modern smart grids make heavy use
of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) which act as dedicated
embedded systems that change actuators based off of sensor values
in a continuous feedback loop.
Malware-based attacks against these infrastructures, such as
Stuxnet [30], Havex [51], and Dragonﬂy [12], have been well stud-
ied, and different solutions have been proposed [25, 45]. However,
erroneous activity by human operators, whether intentionally or by
mistake can have even more due consequences than existing mal-
ware attacks. The lack of protections against system misconﬁgura-
tions can lead to severe consequences. In 2011, a lack of real-time
situational awareness and limit protections on transmission lines
resulted in a cascading series of power outages, affecting large por-
tions of Arizona, southern California, and northern Mexico, caus-
ing 1.5 million customers in these areas to lose power for up to 12
hours [10]. Even worse, malicious activities can also seem to be
operation mistakes, such as the coordinated attack on the Ukranian
power grid [17]. Moreover, an operator once logged in, usually
has a complete view of the whole system, even if the operator is
only in charge of a sub area of the system. This unlimited access
to system variables and the simple static policy controls for opera-
tors demonstrate that cyber-physical infrastructures are unprepared
to maintain their safe and secure operation in the face of human
mistakes, leaving alone malicious adversaries.
The key takeaway from these episodes is that insufﬁcient access
control coupled with an insufﬁcient understanding of the relation-
ship between the control infrastructure and the underlying phys-
ical system leads to vulnerabilities, which can be turned into at-
tacks either by careless operators or malicious adversaries. While
past approaches attempt to use information ﬂow analysis for sys-
tem modeling, have tended to ignore the physical world and miss
important inter-dependencies. Moreover, traditional discretionary
and mandatory access control mechanisms are often based on
manually-generated policy rule sets that do not consider the un-
derlying physics of the grid, and its complexity precludes attempts
at formal analysis.
In this paper, we present CPAC, a cyber-physical access con-
trol framework that enables ﬁne-grained enforcement of context-
aware policies in a real-time control system environment. CPAC
takes a comprehensive view of both the computing and physical
elements comprising the control system, and simultaneously incor-
porates both continuous physical dynamics i.e mathematical mod-
els and discrete computing i.e administrator speciﬁed policies into
its security monitoring and control calculations. In doing so, we
can accept high-level requirements such as “Alice should not [di-
rectly or indirectly] manipulate the [power output] for the gener-
ator Gi” or “Bob should not know about power transformer Tj’s
failure,” and have them enforced as low-level policies that ensure
control system constraints are maintained. To generate secure poli-
cies for access requests, CPAC implements a layered ensemble
of lightweight information ﬂow analysis mechanisms. On the de-
vice side, we mark variables within PLC devices to determine data
ﬂow, and we infer information ﬂows through the grid using physics-
based, inter-component dependencies. Information is visible to op-
erators whose access to read and modify variables is tailored to
their particular roles (static polices) and depending on the infor-
mation ﬂow analysis (dynamic polices). Combining the physics
model, information ﬂow analysis on PLCs, and logic-based policy
control, we are able to provide ﬁner-grained access control and bet-
ter situational awareness of the power grid than previous solutions,
securing the grid from human mistakes (or insider attacks), main-
taining the operation privacy, and supporting N − x contingencies.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• Physics-based engine: We demonstrate that by leveraging
the underlying mathematical model within a power system,
we can analyze information ﬂow by the physics equations
and restrict operations that would violate system safety.
• Information ﬂow analysis: We introduce a lightweight
taint-tracking mechanism into PLCs. The lightweight code
instrumentation reports the dynamic control ﬂow used in
conjunction with symbolic execution of the PLC code to
determine variable taints. This symbolic execution is per-
formed ofﬂine ensure minimal performance overhead during
PLC code execution.
• Logic-based policy control: We introduce a new context-
aware policy control using Prolog, where policies are written
in logic statements and the querying the permissibility of an
operation in the Prolog engine. Combined with the physics
engine and information ﬂow analysis, a context-aware policy
is able to guarantee the safety and privacy of an operation.
• Scalability and performance in real-world scenarios: We
model the Polish power grid, consisting of over 2,700 buses,
and model three past blackout events within this real-world
system setting, demonstrating that CPAC would detect and
mitigate all of these problems. CPAC’s analysis and policy
evaluation can be performed in under 150 ms, fast enough
that large-scale outages can be prevented. Because CPAC
maintains system context, it can manage not only N − 2 con-
tingency analysis (simultaneous failure of two nodes), but
N−x analysis, which is infeasible with existing energy man-
agement system (EMS) solutions. CPAC thus provides an
effective new means of maintaining robust operation in the
face of coordinated cyber attacks.
Section 2 reviews existing EMS solutions and how they fail to
withstand operation mistakes or even attacks. Section 3 overviews
CPAC’s high-level architecture and components, describing its op-
eration within a simple control system. Section 4 explains the phys-
ical side information ﬂow analysis. Section 5 describes policy en-
forcement and Section 6 describes device-level information ﬂow
tracking in CPAC. Section 7 describes CPAC’s real-world imple-
mentations and extensive experimental results. Section 8 reviews
related work and Section 9 concludes.
2. ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
An EMS1 is a collection of computer-aided tools used by oper-
ators of electric utility grids to monitor, control, and optimize the
performance of generation and transmission systems. As shown in
1We discuss the conﬁguration of existing energy management sys-
tems (EMS) used to control the power grid infrastructure. We also
discuss their corresponding limitations and vulnerabilities (Sec-
tion 2.1). Our discussion is necessarily abbreviated; a comprehen-
sive overview of these issues is presented by Sridhar et al. [56].

Figure 1: Existing Energy Management Systems
Figure 1, an EMS contains supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) functionality, comprising a suite of applications. These
include:
1. A power system topology processor [15] that continuously
retains and updates electrical system topology such as branch
impedance, loading, connectivity, and circuit breaker status
information, with topology details used as input to the state
estimation process (detailed below);
2. A data historian (database) [33] that stores sensor measure-
ments and system asset conﬁguration information for later
grid analysis and billing;
3. A state estimation system [15] that receives plant sensor mea-
surements and the power system’s current topology, and dy-
namically calculates accurate state of the power system, i.e.,
voltage, magnitude, and phase angle on each power system
bus;
4. Contingency analysis software [6] that performs what-if risk
analysis of potential component failures given the power sys-
tem’s current state;
5. Optimal power ﬂow control analysis [6] to calculate optimal
feasible power system conﬁguration and actuation parame-
ters for load generation balance (i.e., the generated power
should equal the end-users’ electricity consumption); and
6. A human-machine interface (HMI) that includes visualiza-
tion of system parameters for the operators to monitor and
modify.
2.1 Existing EMS Solutions
Current EMS solutions [59, 16, 19] are designed to protect smart
power grids against accidental component failures, but are limited
in the protections they offer. For example, data historians enable
local data storage and coarse-grained sharing of bulk system infor-
