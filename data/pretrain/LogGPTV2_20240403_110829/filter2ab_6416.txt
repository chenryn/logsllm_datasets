**ATT&CK ID:** T1124  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Time Discovery

An adversary may attempt to gather the system time and/or time zone from a local or remote system. In a Windows environment, the system time is managed and maintained by the Windows Time Service. This service ensures time synchronization across systems and services within an enterprise network, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of time-sensitive operations and logs. By discovering the system time, an adversary can potentially use this information to align their activities with specific time windows or to manipulate timestamps in logs and other records.
