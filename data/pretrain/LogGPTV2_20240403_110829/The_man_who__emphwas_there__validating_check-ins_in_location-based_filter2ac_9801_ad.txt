### Normal Check-in Process and Security Measures

During the standard check-in process, the information sent to Foursquare includes a timestamp encrypted using the venue’s private key. This ensures that even with access to old check-in data, a user cannot create a valid new check-in.

### Wormhole Attacks

**Scenario:** An attacker at a venue exchanges information with an accomplice to perform a check-in. The NFC server only completes the protocol if the user responds within an acceptable time window. However, the nonce (a number used once) is unpredictable, and the challenge cannot be relayed in time. 

**Alternative Attack:** The attacker might use a device mimicking an NFC server to attempt a check-in at a different venue (Venue X). The NFC server at Venue X will not receive the challenge in time, thwarting the attack.

### Eavesdropping Attacks

An eavesdropper passively monitors the communication between users and the NFC server to discover the users’ identities. However, they can only acquire the publicly known VenueID, as the UserID is encrypted with Foursquare’s public key.

### System-wide Sybil Attacks

**Objective:** The attacker aims to disrupt the system by acquiring mayorship of all (or most) venues using multiple accounts. With existing defense mechanisms, this can be achieved with minimal resources. 

**Countermeasure:** Our NFC server imposes physical constraints on the check-in process, requiring attackers to physically visit each venue, which is practically impossible.

### Targeted Sybil Attacks

**Objective:** The attacker targets specific venues offering deals after a certain number of check-ins, using multiple accounts to collect offers. 

**Countermeasure:** Even with our countermeasures, such attacks are still possible but significantly mitigated. The attacker would need to stay near the NFC server for an unnatural amount of time to check in multiple accounts, making the attack impractical.

### Performance Analysis

**Encryption Time:**
- **Arduino:** Performs poorly due to limited computational capabilities and RAM size.
- **Raspberry Pi:** Efficient, even with 2,048-bit keys, encryption takes only 5 ms.
- **Galaxy Smartphone:** Also performs well, with encryption times comparable to the Raspberry Pi.

**Table 2: Average Encryption Time (ms) for Different RSA Key Sizes (bits)**

| Keysize | Arduino | Rasp.Pi | Galaxy |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 512     | 25,056  | 2.745   | 2.265  |
| 1,024   | 224,279 | 3.228   | 2.834  |
| 2,048   | 1,587,550 | 5.130  | 5.042  |
| 4,096   | NA      | 12.150  | 12.501 |

**Check-in Process:**
- **Current Limitation:** Android requires the user to tap the screen for authorization before sending data over NFC. Multiple messages can only be sent in batches.
- **Solution:** We implemented a version that uses NFC to pair devices and sends protocol data over Bluetooth, requiring only one tap to initiate pairing. This version has a total check-in process time of 105 ms (average over 100 runs).

**LBS Workload:**
- **Public-key Cryptography:** Computationally expensive but manageable with modern hardware acceleration. For example, Sun’s UltraSPARC T1 performed 20,425 signature verifications per second with a 2,048-bit key.

**Cost:**
- **Components:** Retail price is $75, but bulk purchases can significantly reduce costs, making it feasible for LBS to provide validated check-ins at a low cost.

### Related Work

**Joining LBS:**
- **User Motives:** Researchers have found that a significant portion of users join systems like Foursquare for discounts and special offers. Cramer et al. also noted that both the “gaming” aspect and venue offers are significant incentives.

**Attacking LBS:**
- **Fake-Location Attacks:** He et al. raised awareness about fake-location attacks. Our work systematically identifies thresholds for detection heuristics and demonstrates the true extent of potential attacks.

**Validating User Location:**
- **Carbunar et al. (2012):** Proposed mechanisms for private badges in geosocial networks, but their solution is susceptible to wormhole attacks.
- **Echo Protocol (2003):** Securely verifies location claims using a time-of-flight approach but requires specialized devices. Our solution leverages NFC capabilities in modern smartphones.

### Conclusion

Using a black-box testing approach, we revealed the server-side heuristics employed by Foursquare and Places for detecting fake-location attacks and discovered their thresholds. We also presented an algorithm for maintaining mayorship and implemented Validated Check-in, an NFC server that eliminates system-wide threats. Our research aims to highlight the vulnerability of LBS and the impact of fake-location attacks, and to design and implement effective countermeasures.
