User: How to add HTTPS certificate in Nginx?
Assistant: To add an HTTPS certificate in Nginx, the following steps need to be completed: 1. Obtain an SSL certificate: You need to either create an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) or yourself. Note that in order for your site to be secure, a valid SSL certificate must be used. If you use a self-signed certificate, you may get a "Website is not secure" warning. 2. Create the SSL certificate file: You need to convert the certificate to PEM format. Also, you will need to create a PEM file in which to store the SSL private key. 3. Configure the Nginx server: You need to edit the configuration file of the Nginx server to configure the server with an SSL certificate. In Nginx, you need to add the following configuration: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; # Specify the SSL port server_name example.com; # Specify the website domain name ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt; # Specify the SSL certificate file path ssl_certificate_key / path/to/private.key; # Specify the SSL private key file path... } ``` Please note that you need to replace "/path/to/certificate.crt" and "/path/to/private.key" is the actual path to your certificate and private key. 4. Restart the Nginx server: Finally, you need to restart the Nginx server to apply the changes. After completing the above steps, your website will provide a secure connection through the HTTPS protocol.
