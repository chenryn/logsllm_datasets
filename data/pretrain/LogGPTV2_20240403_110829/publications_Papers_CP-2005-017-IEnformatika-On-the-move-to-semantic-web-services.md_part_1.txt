I. MOTIVATION FOR THE SEMANTIC WEB
C URRENTLY, the World Wide Web is primarily
composed of documents written in HTML (Hyper Text
Markup Language), a language that is useful for visual
presentation. HTML is a set of “markup” symbols contained
in a Web page intended for display on a Web browser. Most
of the information on the Web is designed only for human
consumption. Humans can read Web pages and understand
them, but their inherent meaning is not shown in a way that
allows their interpretation by computers.
The information on the Web can be defined in such a way
that it can be used by computers not only for display purposes,
but also for interoperability and integration between systems
and applications. One way to enable machine-to-machine
exchange and automated processing is to provide the
information in such a way that computers can understand it.

This is precisely the objective of the semantic Web – to make
possible the processing of Web information by computers.

rules for the syntax and semantics of programs. Semiotics is
composed of three fundamental components: syntax,
semantics, and pragmatics.
• Syntax deals with the formal or structural relations
between signs (or tokens) and the production of new
ones. For example, grammatical syntax is the study in
which sequences of symbols are well formed according to
the recursive rules of grammar. In computer science, if a
program is syntactically correct according to its rules of
syntax, then the compiler will validate the syntax and will
not generate error messages. This however does not
ensure that the program is semantically correct.
• Semantics is the study of relations between the system of
