 **TypeScript Version:**
nightly (1.9.0-dev.20160429)
**Code**
    for (let num of [ 1, 2, 3 ]) {
      num.toString();
    }
**Expected behavior:**  
There should be no error; `num` should be reported as just a `number`.
**Actual behavior:**  
`num` has type `number | undefined`, so compiler complains with `Object is
possibly 'undefined'`.
