 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.2
**Problem**
I've found that somewhere between typescript 1.6.2 and 1.8.2, it started
printing relative file names in error messages instead of absolute file names.
This makes it harder for us to find the right (generated) input file, since we
have to know what the paths are relative to. Was this change on purpose, or
accidental? It's not listed in the change log.
