**ATT&CK ID:** T1055.014  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** VDSO Hijacking

Adversaries may use VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) hijacking to inject malicious code into the address space of a live process, thereby evading process-based defenses and potentially elevating their privileges. VDSO hijacking is a technique that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of another running process. This method can be particularly effective in bypassing security measures that monitor and restrict the creation and execution of new processes.
