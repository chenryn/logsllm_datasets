the figure shows the modelâ€™s top-1 token prediction right next
to the masked input log paragraph. The label column is theground truth for the log paragraph, the prediction column is
the prediction (0 or 1) based on whether the top-k prediction
accuracy is above (prediction: 0) or below (prediction: 1) the
threshold (0.9).
a) Centroid Distance Minimisation: 	The LogBERT
model uses the centroid distance minimisation training
objective to supplement masked log key prediction during
training and evaluation. To study the effect of centroid distanceminimisation on model performance, a version of LogFiT was
