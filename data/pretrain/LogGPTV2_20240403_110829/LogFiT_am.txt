The figure illustrates the model's top-1 token prediction adjacent to the masked input log paragraph. The "Label" column represents the ground truth for the log paragraph, while the "Prediction" column indicates the model's prediction (0 or 1). The prediction is determined based on whether the top-k prediction accuracy is above (prediction: 0) or below (prediction: 1) a specified threshold of 0.9.

**Centroid Distance Minimisation:**
The LogBERT model incorporates centroid distance minimization as an additional training objective, which complements the masked log key prediction during both training and evaluation. To examine the impact of centroid distance minimization on the model's performance, a version of LogFiT was utilized.
