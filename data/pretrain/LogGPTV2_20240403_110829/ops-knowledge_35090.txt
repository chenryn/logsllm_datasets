User: How to configure Zabbix to monitor the performance indicators of a group of servers?
Assistant: First, you need to create a hostgroup in Zabbix's web console. After opening the console, select "Configuration" > "Host Groups" and click the "Create Host Group" button. Enter a name, display name, and description for the host group, then click the Add button. Next, create a host in Zabbix's web console. Choose Configure > Devices, and click the Create Device button. Enter a name, visible name, and description for the host, and select the host group it belongs to. Then, enable Zabbix agent on the server to be monitored. Zabbix agent is an independent program that collects data of the target host and sends it to Zabbix server. You can install the Zabbix agent on each target host and start it by running the following commands on the target host: sudo apt-get install zabbix-agent sudo service zabbix-agent start sudo chkconfig zabbix-agent on Create monitoring items in the web console. Select "Configuration" > "Items" and click the "Create Item" button. Enter the name, key and type of the monitoring item, and select the target host group and target host. Then, you can create triggers to set trigger conditions. Choose Configure > Triggers, and click the Create Trigger button. Enter the trigger name, description, and trigger expression, and select the monitoring item to monitor. Finally, you can create alert rules to set alert actions. Choose Configure > Alerts, then click the Create Alert button. Enter a name, description, and action for the alert rule, and select the triggers to monitor. After completing the above steps, Zabbix will start monitoring the performance indicators of the target host and send an alarm when the trigger is triggered. You can view monitoring data and alarm history through the web interface.
