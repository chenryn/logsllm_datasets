Abstract. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a fundamental com-
ponent of the current Internet infrastructure. Due to the inherent trust
relationship between peers, control of a BGP router could enable an at-
tacker to redirect traﬃc allowing man-in-the-middle attacks or to launch
a large-scale denial of service. It is known that BGP has weaknesses that
are fundamental to the protocol design. Many solutions to these weak-
nesses have been proposed, but most require resource intensive crypto-
graphic operations and modiﬁcations to the existing protocol and router
software. For this reason, none of them have been widely adopted. How-
ever, the threat necessitates an eﬀective, immediate solution.
We propose a system that is capable of detecting malicious inter-domain
routing update messages through passive monitoring of BGP traﬃc. This
approach requires no protocol modiﬁcations and utilizes existing moni-
toring infrastructure. The technique relies on a model of the autonomous
system connectivity to verify that route advertisements are consistent
with the network topology. By identifying anomalous update messages,
we prevent routers from accepting invalid routes. Utilizing data provided
by the Route Views project, we demonstrate the ability of our system to
distinguish between legitimate and potentially malicious traﬃc.

1 Introduction
Research in network security is mainly focused on the security of end hosts. Little
attention has been paid to the underlying devices and protocols of the network
itself. This has changed with the emergence of successful attacks against the
infrastructure of the global Internet that resulted in major service interruptions.
The services to handle the translation between domain names and IP addresses
(such as the Domain Name System) and protocols to facilitate the exchange
of reachability information (such as routing protocols) have been recognized as
essential to correct network operation.
The Internet can be described as an interconnected collection of autonomous
domains or local networks, each of which is subject to the administrative and
technical policy of a single organization. There exist two types of routing proto-
cols: intra-domain and inter-domain routing protocols. The task of intra-domain

routing protocols is to ensure that hosts inside a single domain or local network
can exchange traﬃc. The goal of inter-domain routing protocols, on the other
hand, is to exchange reachability information between such domains. This en-
ables hosts to communicate with peers that are located in diﬀerent networks.
There are several diﬀerent intra-domain protocols used today (e.g., RIP [19],
OSPF [22]), while the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto standard
for inter-domain routing.
Version 4 of the Border Gateway Protocol was introduced in RFC 1771 [28].
It speciﬁes an inter-autonomous system routing protocol for IP networks. The
deﬁnition given for an autonomous system (AS) is “a set of routers under a
single technical administration, using an interior gateway protocol and common
metrics to route packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol
to route packets to other ASes”.
The basic function of BGP is to enable autonomous systems to exchange
reachability information that allows so-called BGP speakers to build an internal
model of AS connectivity. This model is used to forward IP packets that are
destined for receivers located in other ASes. The protocol includes information
with each reachability message that speciﬁes the autonomous systems along each
advertised path, allowing implementations to prune routing loops. In addition,
BGP supports the aggregation of path information (or routes) and utilizes CIDR
(classless inter-domain routing) to decrease the size of the routing tables.
The protocol operates by having BGP speakers, usually routers, in diﬀerent
ASes exchange routing information with their BGP peers in the neighboring
ASes. In addition to announcing its own routes, a BGP speaker also relays rout-
ing information received from its peers. By doing this, routing information is
propagated to all BGP speakers throughout the Internet. The two basic opera-
tions of the BGP protocol are the announcement and the withdrawal of a route.
The routing data itself is exchanged in UPDATE messages. Although BGP deﬁnes
three other message types, none of these are directly related to the routing pro-
cess. A route consists of a set of IP preﬁxes (stored in the NLRI – network layer
reachability information – ﬁeld of an UPDATE message), together with a set of
attributes. When a route is announced, the sending BGP speaker informs the
receiver that the IP preﬁxes speciﬁed in the NLRI ﬁeld are reachable through
the sending AS. The withdrawal process revokes a previous announcement and
declares certain IP preﬁxes as no longer reachable via the AS. The most impor-
tant attribute of an announcement is the AS PATH. It speciﬁes the path (i.e., the
sequence of autonomous systems) that the route announcement has previously
traversed before reaching that AS. Other attributes give information about the
origin of a route or indicate whether routes have been aggregated at a previous
AS.
Recently, a security analysis of BGP [23] and related threat models [5] pointed
out two major areas of vulnerabilities of the inter-domain routing process.
One area includes threats that emanate from outsiders. Outsiders can disrupt
established BGP peer connections and thereby launch denial of service attacks.
They do not have privileges to inﬂuence the routing infrastructure directly, but

can attempt to gain access to (break into) a legitimate router or impersonate a
trusted BGP peer. Threats at this level usually do not aim at the routing protocol
design but at the implementation level, in which bugs or vulnerabilities in routing
software can be exploited to crash a machine or to elevate one’s privileges. It
might also be possible to bypass the authentication scheme to impersonate a
legitimate BGP peer.
When an outsider is successful in compromising a trusted machine or an
attacker already is in legitimate control of such a router, the focus shifts to direct
threats from BGP peers. This area includes problems that occur when routers
that legitimately participate in the routing infrastructure maliciously (or by
accident) insert incorrect routing information. This can be the announcement of
false IP address origins or invalid AS paths. Attacks at this level primarily focus
on vulnerabilities in the routing protocol design and exploit the fact that there
exists a signiﬁcant level of trust between BGP peering partners. Invalid updates
can propagate despite message ﬁltering performed by many ASes, because it is
often impossible to evaluate the validity of an update message given only local
information. This might lead to worst-case scenarios where a single malicious or
misconﬁgured router inﬂuences the routing state of the whole Internet.
We propose a technique that is capable of detecting malicious BGP updates
utilizing geographical location data from the whois database and the topolog-
ical information of an AS connectivity graph. By passively monitoring UPDATE
messages, the connectivity graph is constructed by connecting two autonomous
systems if traﬃc can be directly exchanged between them. Using this graph,
we classify all autonomous system nodes as either core or periphery nodes. In
general, core nodes represent the autonomous systems of the Internet backbone
(such as large ISPs) while periphery nodes correspond to local providers, compa-
nies or universities. An important observation is that periphery AS nodes that
are directly connected to each other are also close in terms of geographic dis-
tance. In most cases, peripheral autonomous systems have at most a few links
to core nodes to obtain connectivity to distant networks and additionally peer
only with partners in their geographic neighborhood. This observation leads to
the determination that a valid AS PATH contains at most a single sequence of
core nodes, which must appear consecutively. That is, a path that has traversed
core nodes and enters a periphery node never returns to the core of the graph.
By checking the AS PATH attribute of update messages, we can determine if the
sequence of autonomous systems satisﬁes the constraints dictated by our obser-
vations and detect violations.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents related research
in the area of routing security. Section 3 introduces the underlying threat model
and discusses the attacks the system is designed to detect. Section 4 and Sec-
tion 5 explain our proposed detection techniques. Section 6 provides experimen-
tal validation of important assumptions and reports on the results of our system.
Section 7 outlines future work and Section 8 brieﬂy concludes.

2 Related Work
Much research eﬀort has focused on the security issues of intra-domain routing
protocols [4, 24, 27, 30] and systems that perform intrusion detection for RIP [12,
21] as well as for OSPF [12, 26] have been proposed.
In contrast to intra-domain protocols, research on inter-domain protocols
has concentrated on BGP, and its apparent weaknesses. Several authors have
proposed extensions to the BGP protocol [14, 30] that attempt to authenticate
routing information by means of cryptography. These modiﬁcations aim at coun-
tering threats from BGP peers that inject bogus information into the routing
process, exploiting the fact that this information cannot be veriﬁed and, there-
fore, has to be trusted.
The most well-known approach is called the Secure Border Gateway Protocol
(S-BGP) [13, 14] and operates as follows. During the propagation of an UPDATE
message from AS to AS, each member on the path appends its information to
the message and cryptographically signs the result before passing it along. This
allows everyone in the chain to verify that the NLRI information is correct and
that the update has actually traversed the autonomous systems that appear
in the AS PATH attribute. Unfortunately, this solution requires a public key in-
frastructure in place that assigns public keys to all participating autonomous
systems. Because it cannot be expected that S-BGP will be adopted by all ASes
simultaneously, it is necessary to be backward compatible with BGP. Hence,
during the transition phase, an attacker might send information using the old
protocol. In case of plain BGP updates, the level of trust in the included routing
information is set by the site policy. The obvious risk is that such policies will
often default to accepting the normal BGP update, especially in the beginning
of the change-over.
A major drawback of S-BGP and related schemes is the requirement to ap-
ply changes to the existing protocol. Such changes not only imply a huge cost as
hardware devices need to be upgraded, but there is also a reluctance to switch
to designs that are not proven to work eﬀectively on a large scale. Currently,
it is not clear whether S-BGP will eventually take hold or how long the nec-
essary transition phase will last. In [9], Goodell et al. highlight the fact that
existing BGP security approaches have not been widely deployed. The authors
consider the protocols’ limited ability to be incrementally deployed, the high
computational costs and the infeasibility of modifying the vast installed base
of BGP software as the main contributors to the slow rate of adoption. Recog-
nizing these limits, a protocol (ASRAP – autonomous system routing authority
protocol) that can be incrementally deployed in parallel to the existing routing
infrastructure is proposed. Similar to S-BGP, this protocol allows autonomous
systems to verify routing updates. Unlike S-BGP, however, the UPDATE messages
themselves are not modiﬁed. Instead, each participating AS has to provide an
ASRAP service that can be queried by others to verify transmitted routing up-
dates. The authors themselves realize that the success of their solution requires
AS administrators to install such services and maintain an additional database,
initially without receiving any obvious beneﬁt. Even if such a solution is even-
Topology-Based Detection of Anomalous BGP Messages

tually realized, it would take a considerable amount of time until a majority of
ASes support ASRAP. In the meantime, however, there is a need to provide a
mechanism that can help routers to decide whether information received in up-
date messages appears suspicious or not. This functionality is provided by our
techniques to verify route updates.
3 Threats from BGP Peers
Threats from BGP peers have their origin in the trust a router has to place
in the information it receives from its peers. The protocol standard does not
include or suggest any mechanism to verify this information – that is, the routing
data. Therefore, a malicious or misconﬁgured router can propagate invalid route
advertisements or route withdrawals virtually without restrictions.
The most important information in a routing UPDATE message consists of
the reachability information in the NLRI ﬁeld and the AS PATH attribute. The
NLRI ﬁeld speciﬁes the IP address blocks that are either announced as reachable
through a route or that are withdrawn as unreachable at this point in time. The
AS PATH attribute enumerates the autonomous systems that have to be traversed
to reach the announced address blocks. This is needed to prevent routing loops
but can also be used to make routing decisions based on policy or performance
metrics. For example, when receiving a route to the same target IP address via
multiple routes, the shorter one (as represented by less intermediate entries in
the AS PATH attribute) can be chosen.
As neither the reachability information nor the path attribute can be vali-
dated by a BGP peer receiving an UPDATE message, a malicious router is able
to
1. specify an invalid AS path to an IP block so that the path includes the
malicious AS itself (i.e., invalid AS path announcement).
2. announce that it controls an IP block that it has no authority over (i.e., IP
Address ownership violation).
Such malicious injections can cause traﬃc to be routed to the malicious AS
while legitimate sites become unreachable. This enables the attacker to perform
man-in-the-middle attacks or to launch a large-scale denial of service.
Although many ISPs employ ﬁlters to discard invalid route updates, these
mechanisms do not provide suﬃcient protection. This is conﬁrmed by the con-
tinuous occurrences of incidents [7, 15, 16, 18] where invalid BGP updates are
accepted, leading to large scale loss of connectivity. The following two sections
describe detection techniques that are capable of identifying updates that are
suspicious in the two ways enumerated above.
4 Detection of Invalid AS Path Announcements
An invalid AS path is an AS PATH entry in an UPDATE message that announces
a potential route to a certain IP address range, although the route does not
22

exist. The AS path speciﬁes the sequence of autonomous systems that a route
announcement has previously traversed and describes a potential route to the
destination IP addresses in the NLRI ﬁeld. When a malicious AS crafts an update
message with an invalid AS path, it oﬀers a route to the advertised IP desti-
nations that does not exist. Such update messages mislead other ASes, causing
them to send traﬃc to the malicious AS and enabling the aforementioned man-
in-the-middle and denial of service attacks.
It is infeasible to determine the validity of an AS path that has not been
observed before by solely analyzing single BGP update messages. Consider a
malicious AS that advertises a direct route through itself to the address block
that it intends to hijack. The update message is crafted such that it appears to
originate from the victim AS and an AS that receives such a message cannot tell
whether a new, legitimate connection has been established or whether the route
is invalid.
4.1 AS Connectivity Graph
The required additional information that enables us to analyze AS PATH entries
is obtained from the topology of the AS connectivity graph. This graph is only
based on autonomous systems and the links between them. We do not consider
single routers. We observe that each AS, in addition to having authority over
a set of IP address blocks, is connected to a set of neighboring autonomous
systems. The idea is that these inter-AS connections can be extracted or, to be
more precise, suﬃciently well approximated from processing UPDATE messages.
The AS connectivity graph is a graph G that consists of a set of n vertices
