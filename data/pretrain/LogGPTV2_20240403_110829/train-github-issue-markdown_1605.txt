## Expected Behavior
When I'm using some dynamic component with SSR: false that is crashing I
expect it to see the error somehow.
## Current Behavior
Аpp is just stuck in "loading..." page state: no page error, no console
output, no term output.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
    // pages/index.js
    import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
    const TestLoader = dynamic(import('../components/Test'), { ssr: false})
    export default () => 
    // components/Test.js
    throw new Error('test')
    export default () => hello
## Context
Some 3rd-party libs are validating the initial options by throwing an error
(e.g. Auth0); it makes nearly impossible to debug them
