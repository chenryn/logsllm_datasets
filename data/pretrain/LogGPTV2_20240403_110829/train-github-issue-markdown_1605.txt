#### Expected Behavior
When using a dynamic component with `SSR: false` that crashes, I expect to see an error message or some form of feedback indicating the issue.

#### Current Behavior
The application gets stuck in a "loading..." state. There are no page errors, no console output, and no terminal output, making it difficult to diagnose the problem.

#### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. **File:** `pages/index.js`
   ```javascript
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
   const TestLoader = dynamic(() => import('../components/Test'), { ssr: false });

   export default () => <TestLoader />;
   ```

2. **File:** `components/Test.js`
   ```javascript
   throw new Error('test');
   export default () => 'hello';
   ```

#### Context
Some third-party libraries validate initial options by throwing errors (e.g., Auth0). This makes it nearly impossible to debug them when they fail silently in a Next.js application with `SSR: false`.

#### Your Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 3.2.1
- **Node.js Version:** 8.4.0
- **Operating System:** macOS 10.12
- **Browser:** Chrome
