Question: In the context of TLS, which of the following statements are true regarding the prevention of replay attacks?
"A": "Utilizing a counter or timestamp in messages helps prevent an attacker from replaying a message within the same connection.",
"B": "Fixed values of R_B and R_S during the handshake would prevent replay attacks by ensuring consistent generation of the same symmetric keys.",
"C": "Randomly generated values R_B and R_S for each connection thwart replay attacks by producing a different set of symmetric keys.",
"D": "Replay attacks can be fully prevented by only using symmetric encryption throughout the entire TLS connection."
Answer: AC
