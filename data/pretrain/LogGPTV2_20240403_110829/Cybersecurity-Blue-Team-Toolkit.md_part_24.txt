exploited vulnerabilities found during the discovery scan that are
considered low‐hanging fruit that can be easily exploited. The
Applicable Modules tab lists the Metasploit modules that are possible
avenues of exploitation. Captured data will help you build a report on
what was found in the environment during the discovery and future scans
of the selected IP address range. With the paid version, Network
Topology will draw a picture of the environment like Zenmap. Zenmap is
the GUI Nmap tool that was used in [Chapter 3](../Text/c03.xhtml).
Now that you have all this information about the network, the big
question is, "What\'s next?" If you are interested in pursuing a
client‐side or remote exploit, you will have to investigate which module
is best for you to attempt. This is the stage of a penetration test
where patience is a virtue. Go to the Modules tab at the top of your
project and go down to the Search field.
From the Search Modules dialog box, it is easy to query the operating
system or ports. The exploits that have been written for specific
vulnerabilities will be ranked by which has the best chance of working.
For example, as you see in [Figure
10.11](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0011){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0011}, in my
environment, I have added an old legacy laser jet printer on my home
network that has port 23 open. Port 23 is telnet. Telnet is a network
protocol that allows you to log into another device if it is on the same
network. []{#c10.xhtml#Page_137 .pagebreak title="137"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Telnet is hardly used anymore since it is totally
lacking in security, but it can still be used if you want to send your
credentials in clear text. In my opinion, it\'s a vulnerability, and
it\'s only on my network temporarily so that I can show you how this
works.
![[**[Figure 10.11](#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0011){#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0011
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Finding open ports in the
network](Images/c10f011.jpg){.center width="751" height="215"}
It may take a little research on Metasploit forums, but you can look for
a Metasploit module that may work well to compromise port 23 on a laser
printer. This is how you start building your repertoire with this tool.
As you can see in [Figure
10.12](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0012){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0012}, I have
searched for ***laser jet***. I could have easily searched for
***telnet*** or ***port 23*** to see a list of possible options. After I
searched for a specific topic, I used the Module Ranking column to sort
the modules that have a higher ranking, as shown in [Figure
10.12](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0012). Now the process of using different
modules against different vulnerabilities becomes trial and error.
![[**[Figure 10.12](#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0012){#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0012
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} List of possible exploits to be
launched sorted by starred rankings](Images/c10f012.jpg){.center
width="751" height="458"}
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_138 .pagebreak title="138" role="doc-pagebreak"}My
personal strategy is to open the higher ranking modules---because at
this point, I\'m just trying to gain access or get a foothold in the
network. By opening the link to the module, you get a detailed
description of exactly what the exploit will be doing and possible
options to configure the module. These modules were created by
subject‐matter experts and configured for general best practice. I will
try them out of the box first, and then if I have an idea for
reconfiguring, I will try different parameters. As you see in [Figure
10.13](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0013){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0013}, there is an
HP LaserJet Printer SNMP Enumeration module that allows you to possibly
enumerate previously printed files. I know that the asset in my
environment IP address is 192.168.1.93.

auxiliary module for possible exploitation against a

As you can see in [Figure
10.14](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0014){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0014}, in less than
5 seconds, the connection was refused and forcibly closed. It\'s time to
move to the next most applicable module.

module](Images/c10f014.jpg){.center width="751" height="162"}
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_139 .pagebreak title="139"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Another strategy is to search for operating systems
you know exist on your network and, rather than sort by ranking, sort
them by date. What are the odds that everything in your network has the
newest patches delivered to it on a schedule? Here you are counting on
security administrators being incredibly busy and not getting the newest
and latest upgrades and patches on their machines in a timely way.
Another strategy is to search the web for the best, most frequently used
Metasploit modules. In [Figure
10.15](#c10.xhtml#c10-fig-0015){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fig-0015}, you see the
exploits displayed by date when searched for a specific platform.

## Metasploitable2 {#c10.xhtml#head-2-75}
The initial scan that you conducted in [Lab
10.3](#c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0003) was on your personal assets. One of the
best ways to experience Metasploit in a vulnerable environment is to use
Metasploitable2 in a virtual machine. Metasploitable2 is an Ubuntu 8.04
server that runs on a VMware image. The Metasploitable virtual machine
contains a number of purposeful vulnerable services, including the
following:
-   [FTP]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0030}
-   [Secure Shell]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0031}
-   [Telnet]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0032}
-   [DNS]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0033}
-   [Apache]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0034}

-   [MySQL]{#c10.xhtml#c10-li-0036}
[]{#c10.xhtml#Page_140 .pagebreak title="140" role="doc-pagebreak"}To
use VMware as your virtual environment, you can get the perpetually free
VMware player or the VMware Workstation Pro hypervisor that is fully
functional for 30 days. I am using VMware of Workstation Pro on this
workstation to create the Metasploitable2 instance. If you prefer
VirtualBox, you are more than welcome to use a different virtual host.
If you already have VMware Workstation installed, you can skip [Lab
10.4](#c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0004){#c10.xhtml#R_c10-fea-0004}.
In [Lab 10.4](#c10.xhtml#c10-fea-0004) and [Lab
