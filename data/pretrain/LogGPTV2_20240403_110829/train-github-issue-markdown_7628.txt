### Description
I find the connections view often leads to confusion because connections
defined as environment variables and in a secrets backend are not displayed.
This is not stated clearly.
I suggest to:
  1. Display connections set via environment variables (and hide the edit controls for those connections). This could also help debugging a URI string if you could see the URI components broken down in the connection view.
  2. Display an info message in the connections view in case a secrets backend is configured stating that those connections are not visible in the webserver.
### Use case/motivation
Motivation: having to explain over and over that _only_ connections defined in
the Airflow metastore are visible in the webserver.
