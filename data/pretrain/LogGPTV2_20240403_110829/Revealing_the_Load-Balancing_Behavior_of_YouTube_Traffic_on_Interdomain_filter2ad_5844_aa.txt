### Abstract:
For over a decade, YouTube has been a dominant source of traffic on the Internet. To enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) for users, broadband access providers and Google employ load-balancing techniques to manage the high volume of web requests and traffic. This study uses traceroute-based measurements to infer these load-balancing techniques, focusing on the assignment of YouTube requests to specific Google video content caches and the interconnection links between access providers and Google. We analyze a year's worth of data (mid-2016 to mid-2017) collected from SamKnows probes hosted by broadband customers across a major ISP in the U.S. and three ISPs in Europe. We investigate two potential factors influencing different interdomain link usage: geographic location and time of day. Our findings indicate that geographic location influences interdomain link assignment for Comcast users, and a German ISP (Kabel Deutschland) exhibits different link usage during peak and off-peak hours. We also compare the YouTube video cache hostnames and IPs observed by the probes and find that the selection of video cache has little impact on BGP selection of interdomain links.

### 1. Introduction
Google’s YouTube is the most popular video streaming service, with over a billion users collectively watching billions of hours of videos daily. The growth in user base and video content has driven the development and improvement of broadband infrastructure worldwide. Many consumers have shifted from cable television to internet-based media services like YouTube or Netflix, expecting streaming quality comparable to traditional cable TV. Advances in video technologies, such as 8K resolution, 60 fps, and High Dynamic Range (HDR), have increased bandwidth requirements, challenging network provisioning economics.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can coordinate with Google to install Google Global Caches (GGCs) within their networks or rely on peering relationships to connect users to Google/YouTube front-end servers and video caches inside Google’s Points of Presence (PoPs). Despite the significant capacity of these interdomain links, they can still experience congestion during peak hours, leading to inflated round-trip delays and packet losses, degrading user QoE.

This study combines interdomain topology measurement and YouTube-specific probing to investigate the performance-relevant traffic dynamics of ISPs that do not deploy GGCs. We inferred interdomain router-level topology using the bdrmap tool on approximately 50 CAIDA’s Archipelago (Ark) probes. We used a recently developed end-to-end YouTube performance test that streams a video clip and reports information including the hostname and IP address of the YouTube video cache. The test ran on about 100 SamKnows probes for a year (May 2016 to July 2017). We selected probes connected to ISPs without internal GGCs but whose interdomain topology to Google was captured by our bdrmap measurements, limiting our study to 15 SamKnows probes connected to four major ISPs: one in the U.S. and three in Europe.

Our study had two main goals: 
1. Investigate factors influencing ISP strategies for distributing YouTube traffic across different interdomain links.
2. Study whether YouTube’s cache selection approach determines the choice of interdomain links due to the topological location of the cache.

### 2. Related Work
Previous studies have evaluated YouTube's architecture and characteristics by actively sending video requests. Pytomo [22] crawled YouTube video clips from residential broadband hosts, finding that cache selection depends on the user's ISP rather than geographical proximity. Adhikari et al. [2] dissected YouTube's architecture by requesting video clips from PlanetLab nodes, using geographically distributed public DNS servers to trigger DNS-based redirection. Recent studies [8, 10] used the EDNS extension to geolocate Google’s CDN infrastructure. Windisch [24] deployed monitors in a German ISP to analyze video cache selection. These studies did not investigate interdomain link structure, which can impact latency and streaming performance. Our study fills this gap by integrating interdomain topology and end-to-end measurement to understand the ISP's role in load balancing YouTube traffic.

Other studies have used passive measurement to analyze YouTube traffic, including video flow characteristics [12, 13] and cache selection mechanisms [23]. Casas et al. [9] used a 90-hour Tstat trace to contrast YouTube traffic between fixed-line and mobile users. YouLighter [14] used passive monitoring to learn the structure of YouTube’s CDN and detect changes. Passive measurement, however, is challenging for longitudinal studies as it relies on user traffic.

### 3. Methodology
We deployed the YouTube test on approximately 100 SamKnows probes connected to dual-stacked networks representing 66 different origin ASes. The probes were primarily in the RIPE (60 probes) and ARIN (29) regions, hosted in home networks (78). The YouTube test ran once per hour for both IPv4 and IPv6, streaming a popular video and reporting streaming information and performance, including start-up delay, YouTube cache hostname, and IP. We then used paris-traceroute with scamper to obtain forward path and latency measurements. Details of the YouTube tests and SamKnows probe measurements are provided in [3] and [5], respectively.

To identify interdomain links, we compiled the set of interdomain interconnections of the access network visible from a vantage point (VP) in that network using bdrmap. Bdrmap infers interdomain interconnections by issuing traceroutes from the VP toward every routed BGP prefix and performing alias resolution on IP addresses seen in these traceroutes. In the analysis phase, bdrmap uses the collected topology data, AS-relationship inferences, and a list of address blocks belonging to IXPs to infer interdomain links at the router level. We used bdrmap results from Ark VPs located in the same ASes as the SamKnows probes.

#### 3.1 Identifying Interdomain Links from YouTube Dataset
We extracted all interdomain links to Google ASes (AS 15169/AS 36040) observed by Ark VPs, represented by pairs of IP addresses indicating the interfaces of the near and far side routers. We matched these pairs with consecutive hops in the traceroutes to YouTube video caches. This approach avoids false inference but may miss some links with the same far side IP but a different near side IP. Section 4.1 discusses the coverage of interdomain links.

We aggregated pairs with the same far side IP to account for different paths taken by different VPs before exiting via the same interdomain link. We conducted additional IP alias resolution with MIDAR on these far side IPs. Table 1 shows the number of identified interconnection links at each stage.

| Stages | Number of Links |
| --- | --- |
| Interdomain links to Google inferred by bdrmap | 1,268 |
| Links identified in YouTube traceroutes | 468 |
| Aggregated with far side IPs | 61 |
| IP alias resolution with MIDAR | 45 |

#### 3.2 Descriptive Statistics
We analyzed data from May 17, 2016, to July 4, 2017, including a gap from January 4, 2017, to February 15, 2017, due to technical issues. The dataset includes more than 74,000 experiment sessions/traceroute records from 15 SamKnows probes connected to four broadband ISPs in the U.S. and Europe. The YouTube test collected more than 3,000 distinct video cache hostnames and IPs. Table 2 summarizes the combined dataset.

| ISP | Country | No. of SamKnows Probes | No. of Interdomain Links with Google | No. of Observed Video Caches by Hostname | No. of Observed Video Caches by IP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Comcast | US | 12 | 26 | 2,918 | 303 |
| Kabel Deutschland | DE | 1 | 10 | 2,983 | 300 |
| Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A. | IT | 1 | 4 | 183 | 185 |
| Free | FR | 1 | 4 | 183 | 185 |

### 4. Results
We analyzed load balancing behavior on both the ISP and server side by characterizing the use of interdomain links and video cache assignment. These choices are interdependent, as ISPs route YouTube requests based on the IP address of the video cache assigned by YouTube. We attempted to isolate these behaviors and investigate them separately, focusing on geographic location and time of day. We also used hostnames and IP addresses of YouTube caches to estimate the influence of YouTube’s video cache selection mechanism on interdomain paths traversed by YouTube requests.

#### 4.1 Interconnection Between ISPs and Google
Consistent with public data, we observed multiple interdomain links connecting ISPs to Google in various locations. Figures 1(a) and (b) show heatmaps of the interdomain links used by probes in Comcast and the three European ISPs. Each row represents a SamKnows probe, with changing colors indicating changing interdomain links. The YouTube tests and traceroutes execute once per hour, so the time resolution of each cell in a row is 1 hour. Gray color indicates no data available, while white color indicates the probe was online but no interdomain link was identified.

For Comcast, which hosts multiple Ark VPs, we identified an interdomain link in 83.4% of traceroutes. For ISP Free (#71) and Telecom Italia (#43), we identified an interdomain link in only 40.2% and 77.7% of traceroutes, respectively. The large white portion in #02 after February 2017 was caused by the relocation of the probe from a Kabel user to an M-net user, where Ark did not have any VP.

Each probe used at least two interdomain links throughout the measurement period, with some probes observing more than six links. Load balancing among links was frequent, reflected by changes in color over time. Some monitors ceased using a link that other monitors continued to use, suggesting reasons other than a link outage. We observed only one link (light blue color) captured by five monitors (#27, #67, #44, #60, #32) that switched entirely to another link (darker blue) after mid-February 2017. The set of links used by different monitors varied widely, even within the same ISP.

We systematically studied the assignment of interdomain links to probes by computing the probability of observing each link. We define the link usage probability, \( P_{l}^{b} \), as:

\[
P_{l}^{b} = \frac{n_{l}^{b}}{\sum_{i \in L} n_{i}^{b}}
\]

where \( L \) is the set of all 45 interdomain links observed in our data, and \( n_{l}^{b} \) is the number of observations of link \( l \) by probe \( b \). Higher values indicate a higher probability for the probe to use that link.

Due to space limitations, we show results for six representative probes (including 38 links and all 4 ISPs) in Figure 2. The x-axis shows different interdomain links, while the y-axis indicates the link usage probability (log scale). Different color bars distinguish results for the six probes. The gray dotted vertical lines separate links of different ISPs. Four probes in Comcast (#61, #38, #78, #44) showed slight overlap in interdomain link use, while three probes in Comcast (#38, #78, #44) showed comparable probability of using at least two links, indicating load balancing behavior. Probes #02, #43, and #71 distributed requests to at most ten links. To demystify the assignment of links, we examined two possible factors: geographical location and time of day.

### Conclusion
Our study provides insights into the load-balancing behavior of YouTube traffic on interdomain links. Geographic location appears to influence interdomain link assignment for Comcast users, and a German ISP (Kabel Deutschland) exhibits different link usage during peak and off-peak hours. The selection of video cache has little impact on BGP selection of interdomain links. Future work will focus on further refining the understanding of these dynamics and their implications for network performance and user QoE.
