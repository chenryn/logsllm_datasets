## Expected Behavior
When a INPUT or SELECT components are inside of GRID component, they should
follow the layout established by the GRID component.
## Current Behavior
Right now 
            current behavior: the input do not fill the space assigend by the grid
                  {factor.editLabel}
            {"expected behavior: the input field (and selects) should fill all the space assigned to it by the "}
                  {factor.editLabel}
        );
      }
      handleChange(event) {
        alert(event.target.value);
      }
    }
    export default withRoot(Index);
  1. An example is in: https://codesandbox.io/s/24zr5plwwy
## Context
I believe this is a problem because <INPUT and <SELECT are not following the
space assignation rules of the <GRID component, making the <GRID component not
so useful to build forms.
