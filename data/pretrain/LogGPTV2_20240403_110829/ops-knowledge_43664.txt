User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows7 - “The specified network password is not correct.” when the password is in fact correct I have a samba server setup for some time now. It is a Hardware NAS - which unfortunately does not provide access to the Samba logs. (the exact model of the NAS is called Addonics NAS Adapter )

I also have a Windows Vista and a Windows XP machine - from both I am able to map \\192.168.0.20\Smd with no errors ( net use l: \\192.168.0.20\Smd works, after asking for my username and password).

I also bought a brand new computer, with Windows 7, and when I try to execute the same exact net use command on it - using the exact same username/password pair, I get a "The specified network password is not correct." message. I also tried mapping from the Windows explorer menu, and got the same error.

I synchronized the clocks of the two machines, tried again... and yet the same error persists.

So what is really surprising here is that mapping works from WindowXP and Windows Vista machines, but fails from a Windows7 machine using the exact same command and username/password - Anyone has any idea of what could be causing this or how to solve the problem? Thanks

Assistant: Dominic D's explanation of what is going on is correct: Vista, Windows7, and Windows2008 r2 use NTLMv2 by default. Older implementations of Samba don't support this and will return a password failure.  Fortunately you can tell Vista and Windows 7 (and I presume Server 2k8) to use the v1 protocol if the v2 is not available.

These are my notes for Vista, they worked for Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.


Start -> run -> secpol.msc
Local Policies -> Security Options -> Network Security: LAN Manager Authentication
Change NTVLM2 responses only to LM and NTLM - use NTLMV2 session
security if negotiated


If you are stuck with a Vista Home, there is no secpol.msc. Instead:


Start -> Run -> regedit
navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
for LmCompatibilityLevel, change the '3' to a '1'
Rebooting might be necessary at this point.
