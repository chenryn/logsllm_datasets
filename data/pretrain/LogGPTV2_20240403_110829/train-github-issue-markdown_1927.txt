When we use complex arguments, in telnet mode , we need use jsonArray to
parse.  
But in our code ,someone try to resolve an overwrite problem ,so make an issue
#257  
then @beiwei30 try to fix this issue use this code below `27917f2`
The code will make the default method not take effect.
The code before like this
     private static Method findMethod(Exporter exporter, String method, List args) {
            Invoker invoker = exporter.getInvoker();
            Method[] methods = invoker.getInterface().getMethods();
            Method invokeMethod = null;
            for (Method m : methods) {
                if (m.getName().equals(method) && m.getParameterTypes().length == args.size()) {
                    if (invokeMethod != null) { // 重载
                        if (isMatch(invokeMethod.getParameterTypes(), args)) {
                            invokeMethod = m;
                            break;
                        }
                    } else {
                        invokeMethod = m;
                    }
                    invoker = exporter.getInvoker();
                }
            }
            return invokeMethod;
We can have a default method with the the methodName and the same length
arguments.  
But after the code change , it must provides the correct arguments type. We
should know  
json parse cannot give the corrent type. It maybe JsonObject or even HashMap.  
So someone points out this problem #2766.  
In my opinion ,we should not define the same name method. Such as retry or
timeout , these configs may just take effect in method or service or provider
.In these cases ,methodName can stands for method. That is to say ,a lot of
configs just consider the method name .  
In dubbo 2.7.x, for this issue ,dubbo provides a new telnet command called
select.  
So ,We should consider which is better.
