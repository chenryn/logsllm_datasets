# count() (aggregation function)
Counts the number of records per summarization group, or total if summarization is done without grouping.
[!INCLUDE [ignore-nulls](../../includes/ignore-nulls.md)]
To only count records for which a predicate returns `true`, use [countif()](countif-aggregation-function.md).
[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note](../../includes/data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note.md)]
## Syntax
`count()`
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
