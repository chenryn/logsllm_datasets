### Dynamic Packaging and Interoperability in the Tourism Industry

Dynamic packaging allows consumers to create a reservation package that is managed as a single transaction, requiring only one payment. This process conceals the individual pricing of each component within the package.

Current dynamic packaging solutions are developed using a hard-coded approach to integrate various systems, enabling interoperability among decentralized, autonomous, and heterogeneous tourism information systems. However, this method does not align with the highly dynamic and decentralized nature of the tourism industry. Many players in the industry, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have information systems with varying scopes, technologies, architectures, and structures. This diversity complicates interoperability and poses a significant barrier for emerging e-marketplaces and dynamic packaging applications, especially for smaller entities (Fodor and Werthner 2004-5).

Two emerging technologies, Web services and semantics, can facilitate a more integrated solution for dynamic packaging (Cardoso 2005). Unlike the hard-coded approach, Web services adopt a loosely coupled software component model, which can be dynamically located and integrated on the web. This flexibility enables the design of processes that model dynamic packaging applications. Semantics are crucial because they provide a shared and common understanding of data and services, enhancing the interoperability and integration of inter- and intra-company travel information systems.

**Figure 1-9** illustrates the integration of various tourism information systems to support dynamic packaging. It shows how new communication links are established among different participants in the distribution model to integrate tourism products.

### Open Specifications and XML in the Travel Industry

The travel industry has focused on developing open specification messages based on XML to ensure seamless communication between industry segments. For example, the OpenTravel Alliance (OTA 2004) is an organization that develops and uses specifications to support e-business across all segments of the travel industry. It has produced over 140 XML-based specifications (Cardoso 2004).

However, these XML-based specifications, such as OTA schema, are not sufficiently expressive to guarantee automatic exchange and processing of information for dynamic applications. A more suitable solution is the development of ontologies specific to the tourism industry. These ontologies serve as a common language for tourism-related terminology and promote seamless information exchange across all travel industry segments. Ontologies enable the shift from purely syntactic to semantic interoperability by providing explicit, formal descriptions of concepts and their relationships, along with a shared vocabulary.

### Semantic Digital Libraries

Libraries are essential components of the information infrastructure, indispensable for education and research. Metadata has been used in libraries for centuries, with the most common classification systems being the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification (LCC). In the United States, the DDC is used in 95% of public and K-12 school libraries, 25% of college and university libraries, and 20% of special libraries. The DDC system has 10 major subjects, each with 10 secondary subjects (DDC 2005). The LCC system uses letters to organize materials into 21 general branches of knowledge, further divided into more specific subject areas (LCCS 2005).

As traditional libraries transition to digital libraries, new requirements have emerged. One key feature is the efficient browsing of electronic catalogues, which requires the use of common metadata and controlled vocabularies. Semantic annotation of digital library content goes beyond controlled vocabularies, thesauri, or taxonomies, allowing for meaningful retrieval of records using full text and bibliographic descriptions.

Semantic Web technologies like RDF and OWL can be used as a common interchange format for catalogue metadata and shared vocabulary, simplifying the task of implementers when interoperating with other digital library systems.

### Semantic Grid

The concept of the Grid has been proposed as a fundamental computing infrastructure to support e-Science. The Grid is a service for sharing computer power and data storage capacity over the Internet, providing functionalities for rapid assembly and disassembly of services into temporary groups. The Semantic Grid extends the current Grid by using semantic Web technologies to describe information, computing resources, and services in standard ways that can be processed by computers. This two-step access to resources involves searching metadata catalogues to find the required data or service and then accessing or invoking it.

### Semantic Enterprise Information Integration

Enterprise information integration faces challenges related to diverse content formats, disparate content nature, and the need to derive intelligence from this content. Current tools leveraging syntactic search and metadata are insufficient. Semantic metadata, which annotates documents with contextual meaning, enables software programs to understand and make correct decisions about document usage.

Semantic technology is a key enabler for deriving business value via enterprise information integration and can enhance the next generation of information integration and analysis software in several areas (Sheth 2003):
- Extract, organize, and standardize information from disparate and heterogeneous sources.
- Identify relevant knowledge from various sources and formats.
- Analyze and correlate extracted information to discover non-obvious relationships.
- Automate the processes of extraction, normalization, and maintenance of knowledge and content.
- Provide tools for fast and high-quality querying, browsing, and analysis of relevant and actionable information.

### Semantic Web Search

Swoogle is a crawler-based indexing and retrieval system for the semantic Web, built on top of the Google API. Developed by the ebiquity research group at the University of Maryland, Swoogle indexes Semantic Web Documents (SWD) written in RDF and OWL, rather than plain HTML documents. It extracts metadata for each discovered document and computes relationships among them. Swoogle also defines an ontology ranking property similar to Google's pageRank and sorts search results accordingly.

Swoogle supports software agents, programs via service interfaces, and researchers via the Web interface. It stores metadata about the documents, terms, and individuals they define and use. Currently, the database contains information on over 275,000 semantic Web documents, including more than 40 million triples, 90,000 classes, 50,000 properties, and 6 million individuals.

### Semantic Web and AI

The semantic Web and Artificial Intelligence (AI) differ in their focus. AI aims to develop complex programs that can understand data, while the semantic Web focuses on making data "smart" and machine-readable. The semantic Web requires inference mechanisms to handle large numbers of assertions, which has attracted the attention of the AI community. Description Logic, a common knowledge representation language, forms the basis of many semantic Web languages.

### Semantic Web and Databases

Although an ontology schema may resemble a database schema, the fundamental difference is that ontologies capture real-world or domain semantics and represent ontological commitments. Despite this, many database researchers express reservations about the semantic Web, citing concerns about the scalability of creating and maintaining large ontologies, semantic annotation, and inference mechanisms.

### Bioinformatics Ontologies

In bioinformatics, the integration of information sources is a significant challenge. The Gene Ontology (GO) is a notable achievement, providing a mechanism for consistent descriptions of gene products in different databases. GO is becoming a de facto standard in gene and gene product annotations. It includes over 17,000 terms organized into three hierarchies: molecular functions, cellular components, and biological processes (Bodenreider, Aubry et al. 2005).

This comprehensive overview highlights the importance of semantic technologies in various domains, from the tourism industry to bioinformatics, and underscores the need for continued development and integration of these technologies.
