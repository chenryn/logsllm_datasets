**Issue with `onBeforeRequest` and `set-cookie` in Electron**

I am using the `onBeforeRequest` event to intercept HTTP requests and redirect them to a custom protocol, "app". However, when I make a request using `http.request` in Node.js (which includes a `set-cookie` header in the response), the `registerStreamProtocol` callback processes the response. As a result, the `set-cookie` header is lost.

How can I retain the `set-cookie` header in this scenario?

**Environment:**
- Electron: 9.3.1
