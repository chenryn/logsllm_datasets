### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
every call that I make with `npm ...` e.g. calling a script `npm run connect`,
there is this weird looking log that makes no sense in this context:
    (⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂⠂) ⠇ : timing config:load:flatten Completed in 2ms
E.g. I have `npm run connect` setup where it connects to a preconfigured
server, but this annoying log doesn't allow me to read the buffer.  
This happens across different workspaces with different npm package.json files
too!
### Expected Behavior
log should not appear
### Steps To Reproduce
I'm not sure how this came to be...
