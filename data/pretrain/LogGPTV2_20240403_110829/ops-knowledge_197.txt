User: How to use the Linux command line tool traceroute to check the reachability and delay of network links?
Assistant: The traceroute command is used to trace the path of network data packets transmitted in the Internet, and can detect the reachability and delay of network links. The following is an example of using the traceroute command in the Linux system: 1. Open the terminal and enter the following command: traceroute www.google.com 2. The terminal will output a series of trace results, showing the number of routers, IP addresses and delay times that the data packets pass through , for example: traceroute to www.google.com (216.58.200.68), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 1.685 ms 2.710 ms 3.696 ms 2 10.249.1.1 (10.24 9.1.1) 8.585 ms 9.600 ms 10.582 ms 3 118.123.240.1 (118.123.240.1) 26.560 ms 31.128 ms 35.670 ms 4 219.158.3.85 (219.158.3.85) 67.955 ms 70.661 ms 73.39 4 ms 5 219.158.113.158 (219.158.113.158) 78.207 ms 76.899 ms 75.695 ms 6 219.158 .25.70 (219.158.25.70) 75.293 ms 73.838 ms 72.680 ms 7 203.208.157.21 (203.208.157.21) 70.833 ms 65.297 ms 60.683 ms 8 209.85.241 .211 (209.85.241.211) 58.130 ms 53.602 ms 49.424 ms 9 72.14.233.188 (72.14. 233.188) 49.192 ms 46.045 ms 43.042 ms 10 72.14.238.98 (72.14.238.98) 41.953 ms 39.232 ms 36.228 ms 11 108.170.246.129 (108.170.2 46.129) 37.071 ms 34.261 ms 31.810 ms 12 72.14.233.239 (72.14.233.239) 29.109 ms 26.205 ms 23.692 ms 13 209.85.252.105 (209.85.252.105) 22.245 ms 20.131 ms 18.949 ms 14 72.14.239.119 (72.14.239.119) 17.072 ms 16.830 ms 14.983ms 15 216.58.200.68 (216.58.200.68) 13.602ms 13.067ms 12.160ms 3. In the above results, the first column is the number of hops elapsed, the second column is the IP address for each hop, and the third column is the latency for each hop. If a hop returns an error or times out, the node is unreachable or the latency is too high. 4. Different options can be used to modify the behavior of traceroute. For example, use the "-I" option to use ICMP packets for tracing, and the "-t" option to specify the maximum number of hops. Use the "man traceroute" command to see all available options and their purpose. NOTE: In some cases, network administrators may block certain traceroute features. If you are unable to complete the tracking, please contact them for assistance.
