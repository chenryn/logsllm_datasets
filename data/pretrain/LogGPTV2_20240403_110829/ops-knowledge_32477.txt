User: I am developing an app in GAE. Application provides different view depending upon whether logged-in user is admin or normal user. I want to use 'Google Apps domain' as Authentication Type. So that all user of my domain can login into the application and use it.
Here, application can't differentiate a logged-in as admin or normal user. Somehow I should make an user as admin and as soon as that user logs in, application should use admin view for that user. Is there any way to tell application that a particular user is admin? 
If we have our own USER table, we can mark any user as admin. Whenever a user logs into the app, app can consult USER table to check if user is admin or not? But in my scenario, it is not possible.
Assistant: Why is what you describe not possible? The object representing the logged-in user is an instance of google.appengine.api.users.User. That object has a user_id property. You can use that ID as a field in your own user model, to which you can add a field determining whether or not they are an admin.
