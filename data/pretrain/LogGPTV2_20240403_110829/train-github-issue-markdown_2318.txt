After i integrated `console.command` tags into Shopware shopware5/shopware#559
we hade a discussion about
`Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\DependencyInjection\Compiler\AddConsoleCommandPass`
and its FrameworkBundle dependency.
A project with `symfony/console` and `symfony/dependency-injection` need to
copy this CompilerPass. @bcremer and @xabbuh had some ideas to move this
class.
Maybe we can optimize command registration over dic somehow.
