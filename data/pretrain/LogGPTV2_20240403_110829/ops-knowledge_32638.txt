User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to deny certain groups from logging in on Win7 domain PC I have a Windows 7 Enterprise PC joined to a domain. Without using any domain level security, how can restrict a certain group of users (students) from logging in, but allow another group (staff) to?

Assistant: I don't know what you mean by that "domain-level security" bit... But the correct way to do it is to put the Win 7 PC into its own OU in Active Directory and apply a Group Policy to that OU. In the Group Policy object editor, head to:

Computer Config -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policy -> User Rights Assignment and find the policy setting called "Deny Log on Locally." Add the Students to this group and they will be prevented from logging into the computer(s) to which the policy applies.
