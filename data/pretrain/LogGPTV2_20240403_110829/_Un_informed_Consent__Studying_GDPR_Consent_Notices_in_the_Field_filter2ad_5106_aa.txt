ABSTRACT
Since the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
in May 2018 more than 60 % of popular websites in Europe display
cookie consent notices to their visitors. This has quickly led to users
becoming fatigued with privacy notifications and contributed to
the rise of both browser extensions that block these banners and de-
mands for a solution that bundles consent across multiple websites
or in the browser. In this work, we identify common properties of
the graphical user interface of consent notices and conduct three
experiments with more than 80,000 unique users on a German web-
site to investigate the influence of notice position, type of choice,
and content framing on consent. We find that users are more likely
to interact with a notice shown in the lower (left) part of the screen.
Given a binary choice, more users are willing to accept tracking
compared to mechanisms that require them to allow cookie use for
each category or company individually. We also show that the wide-
spread practice of nudging has a large effect on the choices users
make. Our experiments show that seemingly small implementation
decisions can substantially impact whether and how people inter-
act with consent notices. Our findings demonstrate the importance
for regulation to not just require consent, but also provide clear
requirements or guidance for how this consent has to be obtained
in order to ensure that users can make free and informed choices.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, we have seen worldwide efforts to create or update
privacy laws that address the challenges posed by pervasive com-
puting and the “data economy”. Examples include the European
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [46], which
went into effect on May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer Pri-
vacy Act (CCPA) [42], which becomes effective on January 1, 2020.
These laws uphold informational self-determination by increasing
transparency requirements for companies’ data collection practices
and strengthening individuals’ rights regarding their personal data.
The GDPR’s impact was twofold. While the number of third-
party services on European websites barely changed [41], websites
now ask users for consent prior to setting cookies. In mid-2018,
about 62 % of popular websites in the EU were found to display
a (cookie) consent notice, often referred to as “cookie banner,” and
in some countries an increase of up to 45 percentage points since
January 2018 was observed [12]. The design and complexity of
such consent notices greatly vary: Some merely state that the web-
site uses cookies without providing any details or options, while
others allow visitors to individually (de)select each third-party ser-
vice used by the website. Paired with the fact that consent notices
often cover parts of the website’s main content, this high preva-
lence has led website visitors to become fatigued with consent
mechanisms [8]. Consequently, tools have emerged that provide
pragmatic workarounds — one example is the “I don’t care about
cookies” browser extension [21]. But oftentimes this only leads to
data collection taking place without consent since the default on
many websites is to employ user tracking unless the visitor has
opted out [17], and 80 % of popular EU websites do not offer any
type of opt-out at all [12].
Instead of adopting opt-in solutions or enforcing the existing Do-
Not-Track standard, the online advertising industry has developed
a consent framework [14] to reduce the number of consent requests.
Notices using this framework ask website visitors if they consent to
data collection for different purposes by up to 400 listed third-party
advertisers. Information about their consent decision is then passed
down the online advertising supply chain.
Overall, consent notices have become ubiquitous but most pro-
vide too few or too many options, leaving people with the impres-
sion that their choices are not meaningful and fueling the habit
to click any interaction element that causes the notice to go away
instead of actively engaging with it and making an informed choice.
Most notice designs only partially use the available design space
for consent notices. But we have also seen notices that, e. g., do not
force users to accept cookies, ask for consent without hidden pre-
selections, or provide visitors with granular yet easy-to-grasp mech-
anisms to control the website’s data processing practices. Hence,
we expect that how a consent notice asks for consent has a large
impact on how website visitors interact with it, and we are positive
that there are design decisions that better motivate people to inter-
act with consent notices in a meaningful way instead of annoying
them.
In this paper, we systematically study design properties of ex-
isting consent notices and their effects on consent behavior. We
systematize consent notices using a sample of 1,000 notices col-
lected from live websites and identify common variables of their
user interfaces. Our research goal is to explore the design space
for consent notices to learn how to encourage website visitors to
interact with a notice and make an active, meaningful choice. Over
the course of four months, we conduct a between-subjects study
with 82,890 real website visitors of a German e-commerce website
and investigate their (non-)interaction with variants of consent
notices. We collect passive clickstream data to determine how users
interact with consent notices and invite them to participate in a
voluntary follow-up online survey to obtain qualitative feedback.
The study comprises three distinct field experiments to answer the
following research questions:
In a short follow-up survey answered by more than 100 partici-
pants, we ask website visitors to voluntarily report the motivation
for their selection, how they perceive the notice they have seen,
and how they expect consent notices to function in general.
We find that visitors are most likely to interact with consent
notices placed at the bottom (left) position in the browser window
while bars at the top of the screen yielded the lowest interaction
rates. This is mainly due to the (un)importance of the website con-
tent obstructed by the notices and suggests taking into account
characteristics of the individual website to identify the notice po-
sition most likely to encourage user interaction. Interaction rates
were higher with notices that provided at most two options com-
pared to those that let users (de)activate data collection for different
purposes or third parties individually, even though those notices do
not allow visitors to express consent freely. We also show that the
(1) Does the position of a cookie consent notice on a website
influence visitors’ consent decisions? (Experiment 1, n =
14,135)
(2) Do the number of choices and nudging via emphasis / pre-
selection influence users’ decisions when facing cookie con-
sent notices? (Experiment 2, n = 36,530)
(3) Does the presence of a privacy policy link or the use of tech-
nical / non-technical language (“this website uses cookies”
vs. “this website collects your data”) influence users’ consent
decisions? (Experiment 3, n = 32,225)
more choices are offered in a notice, the more likely visitors were
to decline the use of cookies. This underlines the importance of
finding the right balance between providing enough detail to make
people aware of a website’s data collection practices and not over-
whelming them with too many options. At the same time, nudging
visitors to accept privacy-invasive defaults leads more visitors to
accept cookies, whereas in a privacy-by-default (opt-in) setting,
less than 0.1 % of visitors allow cookies to be set for all purposes.
This suggests that the current data-driven business models of many
webservices, who often employ dark patterns to make people con-
sent to data collection, may no longer be sustainable if the GDPR’s
data protection by default principle is enforced. Technical language
(“This site uses cookies” instead of “This site collects your data”)
appears to yield higher interaction rates with the consent notice
but decreases the chance that users allow cookie use. We find that
the presence of a link to the site’s privacy policy does not increase
user interaction, underlining the importance of making information
immediately actionable rather than pointing to further resources.
Survey feedback indicates that users favor category-based choices
over a vendor-based approach, and they expressed a desire for a
transparent mechanism. A common motivation to give consent is
the assumption that the website cannot be accessed otherwise.
Based on the results of our field study, we conclude that opt-out
consent banners are unlikely to produce intentional/meaningful
consent expression. We therefore recommend that websites offer
opt-in notices based on categories of purposes. Above all, we ob-
served that the majority of website visitors does not accept cookies
for all purposes, and feedback from our survey suggests that a uni-
fied solution that does not interfere with every single website yet
provides more control than a simple yes–no decision would best fit
users’ needs.
2 CONSENT NOTICES
We first describe the legal background of consent notices and cur-
rent challenges for their practical implementation. Then we identify
and analyze variables of the user interface of commonly used types
of consent notices.
2.1 Background
Cookie consent notices emerged in the wake of the European
Union’s Directive 2009/136/EC [45]. The directive changed Article
5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) [44] to require that data
is stored on users’ devices only after having obtained user consent
based on “clear and comprehensive information [...] about the pur-
poses of the processing.” An exemption to this consent requirement
is storing of information that is “strictly necessary,” such as session
or authentication cookies.
On May 25, 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR; Regulation (EU) 2016/679) went into effect. Its
Article 6 contains six legal bases for the processing of personal
data of European residents, including that “the data subject has
given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one
or more specific purposes”. Recital 32 of the GDPR and guidelines
published by EU data protection authorities [6] require for valid
consent “a clear affirmative act” that is a “freely given, [purpose-]
specific, informed and unambiguous indication of [...] agreement to
2
the processing of personal data.” Another document clarifies the
relationship between the ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) and the
GDPR for the use of cookies: Article 5(3) of the directive governs
access to non-necessary cookies in the user’s browser, whether it
contains personal data or not, while the GDPR applies to subsequent
processing of personal data retrieved via cookies [15].
Degeling et al. found that after the GDPR went into effect 62.1 %
of 6,579 popular websites in Europe displayed cookie consent no-
tices, compared to 46.1 % in January 2018 [12].
This high prevalence has sparked efforts to reduce the number
of consents required. The most widely used solution, supported
by the online advertising industry, is the Transparency & Consent
Framework by IAB Europe [14]. This framework has been criti-
cized for its bundling of purposes [36] and a lack of transparency
regarding the parties the website visitor’s personal data could be
shared with [12, 36]. An October 2018 decision by the French data
protection authority CNIL [11] pointed out a lack of consent ver-
ification in the framework, and in April 2019 a formal complaint
was filed against the IAB for showing a consent notice on its own
website that forces visitors to consent if they want to access the
website [37], which is not allowed under GDPR.
Another suggestion to decrease the number of consent prompts
is to move consent decisions to the browser and let users locally
specify their data collection preferences [31]. The browser then
sends adequate signals to the websites requesting data collection.
This would require websites to respect the opt-out signals requested
by the browser — something that has not worked out in the past
with the Do-Not-Track standard [29].
2.2 Properties of Consent Notices
Consent notices currently found on websites vary both in terms of
their user interface and their underlying functionality. Regarding
the latter, Degeling et al. identified distinct groups within existing
implementations of consent notices [12]. Some are only capable
of displaying a notification that the website uses cookies or col-
lects user data without providing any functionality to make the
website comply with the visitor’s choice. In contrast, other cookie
notices are provided by third-party services that offer complex
opt-in choices and block cookies until the user consents explicitly.
Our study focuses on the user interface of consent notices, a
topic which has not been systematically studied before. In order
to identify common properties of consent notices currently used
on websites, we analyze a random sample of 1,000 notices drawn
from a set of 5,087 we collected in a previous study [12]. To obtain
that set, the following steps were taken: First we created a list of
websites containing the 500 most popular websites for each member
state of the European Union as identified by the ranking service
Alexa [4]. This yielded a list of more than 6,000 unique domains.
Using a Selenium-based automated browser setup, we visited all of
them in an automated way in August 2018 from an IP address within
the EU and took screenshots of each website’s home page. We then
manually inspected these screenshots if they contained a consent
notice. In our previous study, we identified six distinct types of
choices consent notices offer to website visitors, as described below.
In this work, we extend our prior analysis to other variables of the
user interface of consent notices. For this, we took the 5,087 consent
3
notices collected previously, drew a random sample of 1,000 notices,
and manually inspected how they differed in their user interface.
We identified the following eight variables, whose possible values,
along with their frequency in our random sample, are listed in
Table 1:
Size. The size of the consent notice as displayed in the browser.
We found the value of this variable to vary widely depending on
the implementation of the notice, from small boxes that only cover
a fraction of the viewport to notices taking up the whole screen.
Responsive web design may result in the same notice using up
different shares of the viewport, depending on the screen size and
orientation of the device used to view the website. Typically notices
take up a larger percentage of the viewport on smartphones than
on desktop computers and tablets. The size of a consent notice may
also be fixed by design, i. e., to cover the whole viewport of any
device.
Position. We observed the consent notices in our dataset to be
displayed in seven distinct positions: in one of the four corners
of the viewport (dialog style; 6.9 %), at the top (27.0 %) or bottom
(57.9 %) like a website header or footer (bar style), and vertically
and horizontally centered in the middle of the viewport (7.8 %)).
On smartphones in portrait mode, the limited space reduces the
number of options to the top, bottom, and middle of the screen.
Blocking. Some consent notices (7.0 %) prevent visitors from in-
teracting with the underlying website before a decision is made [39].
The site’s content may also be blurred out or dimmed [17]. All con-
sent notices shown in the center position were blocking. We also
observed some blocking consent notices at the top or bottom posi-
tion.
cline the use of all cookies on the website.
Choices. Consent notices offer website visitors different choice
options. We identified the following mechanisms for user interac-
tion [12]:
• No option notices simply inform the user that the website
uses cookies without any option for interaction. The user
continuing to use the website is interpreted as agreement to
the notice.
• Confirmation-only banners feature a button with an affir-
mative text such as “OK” or “I agree”, clicking on which is
interpreted as an expression of user consent.
• Binary notices provide two buttons to either accept or de-
• Category-based notices group the website’s cookies into
a varying number of categories. Visitors can allow or dis-
allow cookies for each category individually, typically by
(un)checking a checkbox or toggling a switch. For trans-
parency reasons, the category of “strictly necessary” cookies
(whose use does not require consent according to Article 5(3)
of Directive 2002/28/EC) is often also listed but the switch to
deactivate it is greyed out. Some notices use a slider: Instead
of (de)selecting categories individually the user can move a
