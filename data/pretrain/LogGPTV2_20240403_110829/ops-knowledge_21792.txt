User: what happens to my script in python that does not run through crontab every minute.
My script has execute permissions and then calls two other scripts in python.

This is the content of my crontab (#crontab -l):
*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/rsm/samplesMonitor.py

Thank you guys.
Assistant: I believe it should be */1, not *\1.
