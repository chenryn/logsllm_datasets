There are several issues currently with the mailing list on librelist:
  1. The website (http://librelist.com/) is currently down. This might be transient, or this might be because the service has been slowly decaying over the last months.
  2. The synchro to http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/archive/ is broken since 2012/10/29.
  3. I've been unsubscribed a few months ago due to transient a problem with my DNS. I have since tried many times to subscribe again with the same address, with no success. This may be a very specific problem, or this may be a manifestation of more general issues with the mailing list management system.
  4. I have also tried registering with gmail adresses created just for the purpose of reading the Flask mailing list. I've had mixed successes, and I've also noticed that some of the emails I could see on the librelist.com archives were not delivered to my account(s).
  5. AFAICT, traffic to the mailing list has been going down over approximately the last 2-3 months. This might be because interest in Flask is slowly fading away (if true, bad news for us Flask users), or this might be because of some of the technical issues I've mentioned above (or others), in which case proactive actions should be taken to keep users engaged.
For these reasons, I'm wondering if moving to another mailing list management
platform would not be appropriate.
