Hello, we're working on some tooling to ensure none of our dependencies are
GPL. To do this, we have a maven plugin that walks through projects and looks
at the  block of the projects to ensure they're whitelisted.
Many projects don't have  blocks, but they're super quick to add.
Estimate assumes doing all poms in bulk manually and waiting for a CI to push
out a new snapshot.
