We observed that the duration of jobs is not correlated with the inter-arrival classes (correlation ≈ 0.003). As a result, we decided to model job duration independently from the workload classes, resulting in three distinct distributions, one for each scheduling queue, as detailed in Table VI. A similar analysis was conducted to characterize the number of tasks composing a job for each queue, with each task running on a different node.

For the subsystem models, we adopted different assumptions for the two case studies. In Case Study 1, we generated logs for systems ranging from 512 to 32768 nodes. We assumed only exponential failure inter-arrivals and activated only the processor and memory subsystem models. Additionally, we did not enable propagations and considered only a light workload with CPU-bound jobs.

In Case Study 2, we examined systems ranging from 1024 to 32768 nodes, opting for a more realistic configuration to facilitate discussions regarding actual system settings. The failure inter-arrival processes were configured using Exponential, Lognormal, and Weibull distributions. The parameters for these distributions, as reported in Table VII, were selected based on published results for similar systems [10], [18]–[22], and empirical analysis of the administrator failure reports from SCOPE. It is clear that a practitioner focused solely on validating coalescence algorithms can choose different distributions. Furthermore, we considered propagations between subsystems and nodes, and we included both light and stressful workloads, activated across all three modeled queues.

In both case studies, we parameterized the workload distributions evaluated for SCOPE to the size of the system under analysis using maximum likelihood estimation [20]. Table VIII presents synthetic statistics on the MTBF and the number of failures, broken down by subsystems, for the two case studies.

### D. Case Study 1: Simplistic Assumptions

Figure 6 illustrates the results obtained for the first case study. The plots show the error caused by the coalescence techniques on the MTBF (Figure 6(a)), on the MTTR (Figure 6(d)), the percentage of truncations (Figure 6(b)), and collisions (Figure 6(e)). Additionally, a sensitivity analysis for SC07 is presented in Figures 6(c) and 6(f).

From the plots, it is evident that both tsao and sliding window (W = 20 min) overestimate the MTBF when increasing the system size, due to an increased number of collisions (Figure 6(e)) and no truncations (Figure 6(b)). The absence of truncations is attributed to the large size of the window.
