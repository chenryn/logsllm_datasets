noticed that the duration of jobs is not correlated to the job
inter-arrival classes (correlation ‚âà 0.003). Consequently we
opted to model job duration independently from the classes of
workload, achieving 3 distributions, one for each scheduling
queue, reported in Table VI. A similar analysis has been
performed to characterize the number of tasks composing a
job for each queue, being each task run on a different node.
Considering the parameters for subsystem models, we fol-
low different assumptions for the two case studies. Concerning
case study 1, we produced logs for systems ranging from 512
up to 32768 nodes. Only exponential failure inter-arrivals are
assumed, by activating only processor and memory subsystem
models. In addition, we do not enable propagations, and we
consider only a light workload with CPU bound jobs.
Concerning case study 2, we considered systems ranging
from 1024 up to 32768 nodes. We opted for a more realistic
conÔ¨Åguration, in order to discuss the Ô¨Åndings with respect to
actual system settings. Failure inter-arrival processes have been
conÔ¨Ågured by means of Exponential, Lognormal and Weibull
distributions. Values for their parameters, reported in Table
VII, have been selected according to results published for
similar systems [10], [18]‚Äì[22] as well as by empirical analysis
performed on the administrator failure reports of SCOPE.
It is obvious that a practitioner aiming only at validating
coalescence algorithms can choose different distributions.
In addition, we consider propagations between subsystems

and nodes, and we consider both the light and stressful
workload, activated on all the three modeled queues.
In all the case studies, we parametrize the workload dis-
tributions evaluated for SCOPE to the size of the system to
analyze, using a maximum likelihood estimation [20].
Table VIII reports synthetic statistics on the MTBF and the
number of failures, split by subsystems, generated for the two
case studies.
D. Case Study 1: Simplistic Assumptions
Figure 6 shows the results obtained for the Ô¨Årst case study.
Plots report the error caused by the considered coalescence
techniques on the MTBF (Figure 6.(a)), on the MTTR (Figure
6.(d)), the percentage of truncations (Figure 6.(b)) and colli-
sions (Figure 6.(e)), and a sensitivity analysis conducted for
SC07 (Figures 6.(c) and 6.(f)).
From the plots we can observe that both tsao and sliding
with W = 20min. overestimate the MTBF when increasing
the size of the system, since they tend to produce more
collisions (Figure 6.(e)) and no truncations (Figure 6.(b)); the
absence of truncations is due to the large size of the window
