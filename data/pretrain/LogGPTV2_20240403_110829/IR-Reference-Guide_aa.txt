KEY TAKEAWAYS
Preparation pays off – Preparing for a major incident can reduce damage to the organization, as well as reduce incident cost and management difficulty.Operationalize your incident management processes – Managing major cybersecurity incidents must be part of standard business risk management processes.
Coordination is critical – Effective cybersecurity incident 
management requires collaboration and coordination of technical, operations, communications, legal, and governance functions.
Stay calm and do no harm in an incident –Overreacting can be asdamaging as underreacting.

Overview
Unfortunately, most organizations are likely to experience one or more major incidents in which an attacker has administrative control over the IT systems that enable your business processes and store your critical business data. 
This is a “first aid” style of guidance for cybersecurity to help you:
1.Prepare for a Crisis– Reduce risk to your organization with key preparations.2. In a Crisis– Immediately limit potential damage to your organization. 
This includes tips and guidance for technical, operational, legal, and communications aspects of a major cybersecurity incident. 
While these top-level tips and practices may be valuable in managing a crisis, each incident is unique and complex. This first aid kit is not designed to provide complete and response and recovery guidance. There are no guarantees, expressed or implied, in this document. For comprehensive guidance and specialized advice, we recommend the following:•  You should consider engaging professional assistance	 for an active major incident.
•  You should review NIST Special Publication 800-184 “Guide for 
TARGET AUDIENCE
This guidance is primarily targeted at individuals in the roles of Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO), General Counsel, Communications/PR Lead, and Chief Information Officer (CIO) and immediate colleagues, though many other roles and stakeholders will also find this information valuable.4

This document is designed to help you better manage these challenges, improve your 
program with the benefit of our experience, and instill confidence in your ability to manage a major incident. This is based on our collective experiences across a wide range of Fortune 1000® companies and government agencies.Given the recent spike in cybersecurity threats and the difficulty of defending against them, organizations must focus on how to get the most return on their security investments. The greatest security return on investment will come from prioritizing your security efforts and budget to increase an 
attacker’s cost, as this will deter opportunistic threats and slow (or ideally stop) determined adversaries.|  | X

Major Cybersecurity Incidents
A security incident is an event that affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information resources and assets in the organization. An incident could range from low impact to a major incident where administrative access to enterprise IT systems is compromised (as happens in targeted attacks that are frequently reported in the press).A security incident frequently results in a breach of sensitive information, but it sometimes results in operational/data destruction instead. A breach of personal information has specific legal requirements in many jurisdictions. 
These types of incidents can become very challenging to deal with for organizations that are not equipped or trained to deal with managing a major crisis operation.Our teams have observed significantly better experiences with managing a major cybersecurity incident for organizations that integrate with existing disaster recovery plans/exercises and use of crisis management mechanisms like the Incident Command System (ICS). 
This guidance is focused primarily on the 
Respond and Recover phases defined in the NIST cybersecurity framework. For guidance on ajor incidents, see8

Preparation
This section is designed to help you think through and plan key aspects of building or updating your enterprise breach response plan across these key functions: 
• Technology
• Operations
• Legal
• Communication
Many organizations are more likely to face disaster related to cyber attacks than to fire, earthquake or flooding.Good preparation for responding to a cybersecurity attack can significantly reduce the business risk of an attack and the difficulty of managing the response and recovery. 
This section provides what preparation elements have the greatest impact on responding to a cybersecurity attack, based on experience.

Technology
The preparation for response and recovery of a major cybersecurity incident should include steps to protect against, detect, and respond to an incident. 
For Protect and Detect preparation, we recommend you follow the Microsoft 
securing privileged access (SPA) roadmap of technical controls focused on common jor incidents at 
To prepare to respond, we recommend the following:GENERAL PREPARATIONS
Identify High-Value Assets (HVAs) – You need to identify the critically important business assets and their technical composition (servers, applications, data files, etc.). This 
inventory of HVA components is critical for recovery plans to rapidly assess, contain/isolate, and recover these critical assets during an incident that spreads through the production environment. This identification will also be useful forprioritizing protective and detective controls for these assets and identifying threats to them. 
Confirm Reliable Software Deployment – Validate that you can rapidly execute scripts/installers on all endpoints. In our experience, incomplete or unreliable software deployment systems can significantly hamper recovery efforts.

INVESTIGATION PREPARATIONS11
INVESTIGATION PREPARATIONS
Threat detection and monitoring capabilities – Confirm that you have access to tools and skills that allow you to detect advanced attackers in your environment. These capabilities are constantly evolving, but an advanced program currently would include:
• Event correlation and analysis
• Integrated threat intelligence
• User and Entity Behavioral Analytics• User and Entity Behavioral Analytics 
• Ability to detect with both Indicators of Compromise for historical patterns 	and Indicators of Attack for evolving techniques
• Machine learning analytics
The most critical basic detection capabilities are called specifically in the SPA road map (above).Investigation and Forensic capabilities – Confirm that you have access to advanced tools and skills to investigate targeted attacks that include malware analysis and attack activity analysis that can produce a 
comprehensive attack timeline. You can get access to these capabilities by purchasing tools and hiring analysts or you can retain access via external entities or professional services.Track and analyze response costs – To enable better risk management, you should keep a record of the costs involved in responding to the incident. This should include both direct costs (external services, credit reporting for customers, etc.) and the cost of the time your team spends on investigation and recovery, as well as the negative impact on your organization’s business and mission.RECOVERY PREPARATIONS 
Validated backup and recovery capability for critical data – For example, preparing for a destructive attack that deletes or encrypts data (such as ransomware) requires that you have validated your ability to recover critical data using an offline and/or ransomware resistant backup capability (such as Microsoft Azure Backup).
1212
Create technical documentation/automation – Write and validate technical documentation (and/or automation) for procedures that are frequently required during a security incident, including:
Compromised account recovery proceduresthat include consideration of
• Levels of confidence on account compromise (active attacker use, account credentials exposed on known compromised host, suspicious account behavior, etc.)• How to validate whether accounts were tampered with using offline 	backups, change logs, or other systems of record
• Whether to reset password or rapidly recreate account 
• How to handle potential conflicts/integration with the Identity 	Management system during any account recreation
