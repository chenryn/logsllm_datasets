## Key Takeaways
- **Preparation Pays Off:** Preparing for a major incident can reduce damage to the organization and lower incident costs and management difficulty.
- **Operationalize Incident Management:** Managing major cybersecurity incidents should be part of standard business risk management processes.
- **Coordination is Critical:** Effective cybersecurity incident management requires collaboration and coordination among technical, operations, communications, legal, and governance functions.
- **Stay Calm and Do No Harm:** Overreacting can be as damaging as underreacting.

## Introduction
Unfortunately, most organizations are likely to experience one or more major incidents where an attacker gains administrative control over IT systems that enable business processes and store critical data. This "first-aid" style guide aims to help you:
1. **Prepare for a Crisis:** Reduce risk to your organization with key preparations.
2. **In a Crisis:** Immediately limit potential damage to your organization.

While these top-level tips and practices may be valuable in managing a crisis, each incident is unique and complex. For comprehensive guidance and specialized advice, consider engaging professional assistance and reviewing NIST Special Publication 800-184, "Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery."

## Target Audience
This guidance is primarily targeted at Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), General Counsels, Communications/PR Leads, and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and their immediate colleagues. However, many other roles and stakeholders will also find this information valuable.

## Major Cybersecurity Incidents
A security incident affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information resources and assets. An incident can range from low impact to a major incident where administrative access to enterprise IT systems is compromised. Such incidents often result in a breach of sensitive information or operational/data destruction. A breach of personal information has specific legal requirements in many jurisdictions.

Organizations that integrate with existing disaster recovery plans and use crisis management mechanisms like the Incident Command System (ICS) tend to manage major cybersecurity incidents better. This guidance focuses on the Respond and Recover phases defined in the NIST cybersecurity framework.

## Preparation
### Technology
#### General Preparations
- **Identify High-Value Assets (HVAs):** Identify critically important business assets and their technical composition (servers, applications, data files, etc.). This inventory is crucial for rapid assessment, containment, and recovery during an incident.
- **Confirm Reliable Software Deployment:** Ensure you can rapidly execute scripts/installers on all endpoints. Incomplete or unreliable software deployment systems can significantly hamper recovery efforts.

#### Investigation Preparations
- **Threat Detection and Monitoring Capabilities:**
  - Event correlation and analysis
  - Integrated threat intelligence
  - User and Entity Behavioral Analytics
  - Indicators of Compromise and Indicators of Attack
  - Machine learning analytics
- **Investigation and Forensic Capabilities:** Ensure access to advanced tools and skills for investigating targeted attacks, including malware analysis and attack activity analysis.

#### Recovery Preparations
- **Validated Backup and Recovery Capability:** Prepare for destructive attacks by validating your ability to recover critical data using offline and/or ransomware-resistant backup capabilities.
- **Create Technical Documentation/Automation:** Write and validate technical documentation (and/or automation) for frequently required procedures during a security incident, such as compromised account recovery procedures.

By following these guidelines, organizations can better prepare for and manage major cybersecurity incidents, reducing the potential for damage and ensuring a more effective response.
