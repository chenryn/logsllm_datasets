Assistant: Seems there's a problem with your pip installation. I have two options for you. 
1) Edit file /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packaging/requirements.py and replace line 
MARKER_EXPR = originalTextFor(MARKER_EXPR())("marker") 
with
MARKER_EXPR = originalTextFor(MARKER_EXPR)("marker")
OR
2) Try and upgrade your pip installation with 
pip install -U pip setuptools
