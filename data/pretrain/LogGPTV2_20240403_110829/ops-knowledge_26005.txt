It appears that you are encountering an issue while attempting to install Scrapy using `pip` on Python 2.7. The error message indicates a problem with the `pkg_resources` module, which is part of the `setuptools` package.

Here is a more structured and professional way to address this issue:

### Problem Description
When trying to install Scrapy using `pip` in Python 2.7, you encounter the following error:

```
Exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip/basecommand.py", line 215, in main
    status = self.run(options, args)
  ...
  File "/root/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 72, in <module>
    import packaging.requirements
  File "/root/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packaging/requirements.py", line 59, in <module>
    MARKER_EXPR = originalTextFor(MARKER_EXPR())("marker")
TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
```

### Solution

There are two potential solutions to resolve this issue:

#### Option 1: Modify the `requirements.py` File
You can manually edit the `requirements.py` file to fix the error. Here are the steps:

1. Open the `requirements.py` file located at `/root/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packaging/requirements.py`.
2. Find the line:
   ```python
   MARKER_EXPR = originalTextFor(MARKER_EXPR())("marker")
   ```
3. Replace it with:
   ```python
   MARKER_EXPR = originalTextFor(MARKER_EXPR)("marker")
   ```

#### Option 2: Upgrade `pip` and `setuptools`
Alternatively, you can try upgrading `pip` and `setuptools` to their latest versions compatible with Python 2.7. Run the following commands:

```sh
pip install -U pip setuptools
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Python 2.7 EOL**: Python 2.7 has reached its end-of-life (EOL) as of January 1, 2020. It is highly recommended to upgrade to a more recent version of Python (e.g., Python 3.6 or later) for better security, performance, and support.
- **Scrapy Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of Scrapy you are trying to install is compatible with Python 2.7. Some newer versions of Scrapy may require Python 3.
