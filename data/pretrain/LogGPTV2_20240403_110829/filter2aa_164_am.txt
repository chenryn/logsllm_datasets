engineering by the inventor Thomas Edison, who wrote in an 1878 letter, “It has been just
so in all of my inventions. The first step is an intuition, and comes with a burst, then
difficulties arise—this thing gives out and [it is] then that ‘Bugs’—as such little faults and
difficulties are called—show themselves and months of intense watching, study and labor
are requisite before commercial success or failure is certainly reached.”
 You can enable Single Stepping mode. In Scratch, click Edit, Set Single Stepping. You’ll be
presented with a list of speeds, from Turbo on one extreme to Flash blocks (slow) on the other.
Single Stepping gives you the ability to slow down the execution of your Scratch game so
you can better see code stacks and individual blocks firing. This makes it easier to see if, when,
where, and why your program does not behave the way you want it to.
After you choose your Single Stepping mode, click Edit > Start Single Stepping to begin your
debugging session. Be sure to click Edit > Stop Single Stepping when you are finished to return
Scratch to its “factory default” behavior.
 Get block-level help. Try right-clicking a block that’s in your project and selecting Help from
the shortcut menu. You will see a nifty Help window that graphically shows you how the
selected block functions in the context of a practical example (see Figure 9.9). I personally
find this flavor of online help to be invaluable because sometimes I discover the perfect block
that I previously overlooked, which solves my current troubleshooting or debugging problem.
FIGURE 9.9 Scratch is a beautifully documented coding environment.
 Consider documenting your code. Right-click near a block in your Scripts area and select
Add Comment from the shortcut menu. Documentation is one of the most important best
practices in all of computer programming.
These comments can be intended simply to remind you to fix something a little bit down the
road. You can also use comments to explain your rationale in doing something in your program
(see Figure 9.10); this can be helpful in a year or so when you re-open the project and think to
yourself, “What in the world was I thinking when I wrote that?!”
FIGURE 9.10 Commenting your code is a programming best practice.
Finally, adding comments to your code helps make your code more understandable to fellow
Scratchers who download and inspect your project. Note that you can link a comment to a block
by dragging the comment in the proximity of said block. The little disclosure arrow enables you
to shrink or expand any comment.
Uploading Your Project
Now that you’ve completed your project, it is time to share your work with the Scratch community.
Why do this? Here are a few good reasons:
 You’re proud of your work. You just invested time and effort in creating your Scratch game.
Thus, you want to get the application in front of as many sets of eyeballs as possible. This is a
natural and honorable motive of any self-respecting software developer.
 Share and share alike. The spirit of open source software is to share your work with other
developers to solicit their feedback. By contrast, you are expected to offer constructive
criticism of other peoples’ Scratch projects. That’s how we all learn!
Task: Share Your Scratch Project
Sharing your Scratch project with other Scratch users around the world is the best way
to get your game (and underlying code) in front of as many eyes as possible. You’ll be able
to garner feedback from other Scratchers, and the sense of accomplishment you’ll feel when
other users create remixes of your work is indescribable.
1. With your project open in Scratch, click Share, Share This Project Online or click the
Share This Project button on the main toolbar. The interface is shown in Figure 9.11.
FIGURE 9.11 You can upload your Scratch project to the Projects website directly from
within the Scratch application.
2. Fill in the fields in the Upload to Scratch Server (scratch.mit.edu) dialog box as
completely as possible. Let me help you understand what’s involved:
 Your Scratch website login name and Password: As with most things Scratch-related,
you must have a free Scratch account to upload a project. Click Create account to, well,
create a new user account.
 Project name and Project notes: These fields are automatically populated based on the
.sb project file name and any project notes you added. I highly recommend you add
project notes (welcome message, instructions, and so on) to help people understand and
use your Scratch app more efficiently and effectively. You can add your project notes
either in this dialog box or by clicking File, Project Notes in Scratch.
 Tags; More tags: Tags are keywords that make it easier for Scratchers to find projects
on the Scratch website. You can select any of the six prebuilt tags and/or define your own.
 Compress sounds and images: This option is a good idea because it makes your Scratch
program smaller. A smaller .sb file means that the app runs faster in the web browser and
takes less time for your users to download from the Scratch website.
As you saw in Figure 9.2, the MIT Media Lab developers give you a dedicated web page for each
app you upload. Be sure to check out the page and perform the following actions on a regular basis:
 Read comments left by other Scratchers and take their criticism constructively.
 Proofread and potentially edit your project notes. You can do this directly from within the web
browser, provided you are logged into the site with your Scratch account.
 Consider adding additional tags as they occur to you. There is no upper limit on how many tags
a Scratch project can have associated with it. To that point, other Scratchers can tag your
project as well.
Remixing
Sometimes you’ll come across a Scratch project that is so good it leads you to think, “I’ll bet I can
make this good app great!” This notion is perfectly legal as well as in keeping with the open source
community spirit shared by Scratch and other public domain frameworks.
 In Scratch nomenclature, a remix is a Scratch project that is based on somebody else’s Scratch
project. When you publish a remix, a link to your remix is accessible on the original app’s home
page. By contrast, viewers of your app can click a link that takes them back to the original app’s home
page at scratch.mit.edu.
 Remember that the name of this program, Scratch, derives from the disc jockey (DJ) term of moving
vinyl records back and forth to create rhythmic sounds. Similarly the term remix refers to the method
by which musical artists re-record their songs by using the same melody but changing the style.
Note: About Licenses...
Scratch apps fall under not the traditional GPL license like Raspberry Pi does, but
instead under the related Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license. You can
read the user-friendly license details at the Creative Commons website at
http://is.gd/FAsiS7).
Task: Create a Remix
1. Download another Scratcher’s project from the Scratch Projects website.
2. Modify the project as needed.
3. Upload the project using the method described earlier in the task, “Share Your Scratch
Project.” The bi-directional linking and notifications between the original author’s
project and your remixed project happens automatically, or as my old friend Jeff Kane
used to say, “automagically.”
Chapter 10. Programming Raspberry Pi with Python—Beginnings
If you emerged from Chapters 7 and 8 relatively unscathed, you are ready to embark on a more
comprehensive programming adventure.
 Scratch is a lot of fun to program, but the environment hides all of the programming complexity; this is
by design, as previously discussed. Many educators consider Python to be an ideal first “true”
programming language for the following reasons:
 Python’s syntax and data typing are relatively intuitive and fairly forgiving of rookie mistakes.
 Python is heavily documented; you can find easy-to-follow tutorials just about anywhere.
 Python’s interactive interpreter makes learning new stuff fast and fun.
 Python offers an amazing number of importable code libraries that give beginning programmers
tools to build any kind of application.
 Python is called a “general-purpose, high-level programming language” whose overarching design
principle is code readability. In fact, you would be well-advised to read what Python fans consider to
be their fundamental, guiding principles: the Zen of Python (http://is.gd/sXV6IU). Let me share with
you my favorite entries from the Zen document:
 Explicit is better than implicit.
 Simple is better than complex.
 Readability counts.
 For three simple sentences, that’s quite a bit of wisdom, right? As a programmer, you are much better
off writing code that is as straightforward as possible and documented in such a way that any other
Python programmer can read your code and instantly understand how your program works. To be
sure, if you’ve been practicing with Scratch, you already understand how important community
support is when you’re developing software projects.
 Python’s focus on clarity and readability probably weighed heavily into the Raspberry Pi
Foundation’s decision to build the Raspberry Pi development platform around Python. If you ever
saw C or C++ code, you will instantly appreciate how much more approachable Python is on almost
every level.
Note: Where It Began
Just a tad bit of history before we dive in: The Python programming language was
invented by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. Rossum needed a
fast, intuitive scripting language to help him automate administrative tasks, and he wasn’t
getting very far with the tools he had in front of him at the time. Thus, Guido adapted the
ABC programming language that was popular in the Netherlands at that time to a new
language that focused on simplicity and readability without sacrificing power—enter
Python!
What’s so cool about Python is its flexibility—some call Python a scripting language because you can
write and test code quickly without the need for binary compilation. On the other hand, because
Python has grown into a robust language that supports enterprise-level concepts such as object
orientation, the term high-level programming language seems more appropriate for Python.
 The way I want to teach you Python in this chapter and the next one (itself a hugely daunting task), is
to jump right in and get your hands dirty with the environment. At the end of this chapter I give you
some hand-selected online and print resources with which you can take the next steps in your
development as a Python programmer.
 To that point, however, I strongly encourage you to pick up Sams Teach Yourself Python
Programming for Raspberry Pi, written by my Pearson colleagues Richard Blum and Christine
Bresnahan. Their book touches briefly on the material we deep-dive into (the innards of the Pi), while
my book does the same thing with regard to Python programming. I think that Richard and Christine’s
book and my book complement each other quite nicely, thank you very much!
 Let’s get to work.
Checking Out the Python Environment
Boot up your Pi and fire up a Terminal prompt. It doesn’t matter whether you are in LXDE or not at
this point, although you’ll need LXDE in time when we discuss IDLE.
 As it happens, there are two versions of Python currently in use today, and both of them are included
in the Raspbian Linux distribution. In this book I choose to stick with Python 3, the current version,
because it is a nice improvement over Python 2 (for those interested in an exhaustive comparison,
visit the Python website at http://is.gd/kYsc97).
 Try out the following commands, pressing Enter in between:
python -V
python3 -V
What you just did was to check the currently installed versions of Python 2 (the executable program
file is python) and Python 3 (executable program file name of python3). As with all things in Linux,
case is sensitive, so you need to supply the -V parameter and not -v to see the Python version.
 Later in the book, you’ll find a lot of the code you need to undertake certain Raspberry Pi projects
was written in Python 2. Don’t be alarmed! For our purposes, the differences between Python 3 and
Python 2 are under the hood and everything you learn in this chapter and the next one is directly
applicable to the Python 2 work you’ll do later on.
 Now pop into LXDE and look at the two icons labeled IDLE and IDLE 3. These are shortcuts tha
open the Integrated DeveLopment Environment, or IDLE (pronounced eye-duhl), for Python 2 and
Python 3, respectively. Try double-clicking IDLE 3; the interface can be found in Figure 10.1.
FIGURE 10.1 The IDLE development environment for Python 3.
What’s cool about IDLE, also called the Python Shell, is that it is itself a Python application that
leveraged the Tkinter (pronounced tee kay inter) GUI toolkit. Tkinter and packages like it enable you
to build graphical Python applications that leverage windows, colors, icons, buttons, and mouse
navigation. That said, we’re focusing on console (command-line) applications in this book because
Python graphical programming is an advanced topic and warrants its own chapter if not its own book.
 An Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, is useful to a programmer because most IDEs offer
time-shaving functionality such as the following:
 Interactive help with programming language syntax
 The ability to step into programs and stop/restart at predefined points
 Detailed insight into design-time and run-time errors
 IDLE offers all of this and more. It’s definitely not the most robust (or even stable) IDE, but I use it
here because it comes standard with Python, and it’s already loaded in Raspbian.
Note: Python IDE Alternatives
If you discover that you love Python and want to try out alternatives to IDLE, be sure to
check out some of the open source and commercial code editors and full-fledged IDEs that
are out there. Some notable examples include Eclipse IDE (http://is.gd/fGo9FH) with the
PyDev extension (http://is.gd/yDXZ8m), Komodo IDE (http://is.gd/bIPFT9), and WingIDE
(http://is.gd/jyg8ig).
Enough about IDLE. The whole of Chapter 11, “Programming Raspberry Pi with Python—Next
Steps,” is dedicated to building Python programs using IDLE. For the remainder of this chapter, we’ll
stay in the Terminal environment to interact with Python 3.
Interacting with the Python 3 Interpreter
Open up a Terminal session on your Pi and try out the following procedure. Be sure to press Enter
after issuing each command.
python3
print("Hello world!")
In the first line of code, you invoked the Python 3 interpreter. This means that until you either close
the Terminal window or issue the exit() command, everything you type is sent directly to Python on
your Pi.
 In other words, when you send a Python statement to the interpreter, Python parses, or interprets, that
line of code, performs the instruction(s) contained in the code, and presents the results as appropriate
on the screen.
 Thus, Python is called an interpreted programming language because it takes your plaintext code input
and processes it directly into machine language. (Technically, Python busts the plaintext code into an
intermediate state called byte code, but we don’t need to get too picky about it at this point.)
 Other popular interpreted programming languages include Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.
However, programming with these languages on the Raspberry Pi is likely to be an exercise in futility
because (a) you have to install quite a bit of extra software to get those environments functional; and
(b) as you know by now, the Raspberry Pi is not exactly a processing workhorse. Java in particular is
known for the impact it can have on resource-constrained computer systems. Therefore, the
Foundation’s decision to standardize on Python is very wise because Python is a low-overhead,
flexible, and powerful programming environment.
 By contrast, compiled programming languages such as C and Microsoft .NET must be converted into
executable binary machine language prior to their being run. Therefore, developing compiled-
language projects takes much longer than creating interpreted-language ones because the compilation
process can sometimes be tedious and time-intensive.
 As I said earlier in this chapter, interpreted programming languages are oftentimes called scripting
languages because of their agility and speed at which they can go from design time to run time.
Exiting the Interpreter
 You can tell at a glance that you are inside the Python interactive interpreter because the command
prompt displays as three right angle brackets (>>>). If you need to exit the interpreter to return to the
command prompt, issue the following command:
exit()
To return to the interpreter, you know the drill: Type python3 and press Enter.
Getting Online Help
 The help system that is built into the Python interpreter is, well, passable, although in my opinion you
can’t beat the Python Documentation website (http://is.gd/SGejBj; keep it bookmarked!).
Nevertheless, to access the online help, issue the following command from within the Python
interactive interpreter:
help()
To get a list of help topics, type topics. If you want a list of Python keywords, type keywords (see
Figure 10.2).
FIGURE 10.2 The Python interpreter online help is decent enough.
You can get help regarding a particular keyword by typing that keyword (try print, for instance) from
within the online help system. Alternatively, you can jump directly to a specific help page by issuing
help(‘print’) from outside the help system but inside the Python interpreter.
 Either way, after you are inside a help page and are ready to exit, type q (no, this is not intuitive). To
add insult to injury, you must remember to press Ctrl+D to exit the online help system and return to
the interpreter. Now who said that Python was intuitive again?
Writing Your First Python Program
The traditional first example when a student learns a new programming language is to have the
program print “Hello World” on the screen. The remainder of this chapter is in keeping with that
tradition.
 From the Python interactive interpreter, issue the following command:
print("Hello,World!")
Congratulations on creating your first Python program! What you did in a single line of code is to
instruct Python to output the string “Hello,World!” to the screen. Specifically, print is what’s called a
function—a function is a named object that performs some action when the function is invoked.
 Functions typically take one or more input parameters; these are fed to the function inside of
parenthesis. Hence, in our Hello World example, Python fed our “Hello, World!” string as an input
parameter to the print function, which in turn was written to echo its parameter to whatever output you
specify (the screen, also called standard output or stdout, is used in the absence of a specific output
value).
 Issuing Python statements from the interactive interpreter is all well and good, but it is not sustainable
for anything outside of the smallest of tasks and for testing/diagnostic purposes. To preserve your
hard development work, you need to save your Python source code in a script file.
 Historically, Python script files use the file extension .py. Under the hood, however, these are
plaintext files that are creatable and readable in any text editor. Today we’ll use (you guessed
it)...nano.
Task: Creating Your First Python Script
1. From a Terminal session, ensure that your present working directory is your home
directory:
cd ~
2. Create a new, blank text file in your home directory using nano as your editor:
nano firstscript.py
3. Add the following code (which you can also see in Figure 10.3):
Click here to view code image
1: #!/usr/bin/env python
2: fn = input("What is your first name? ")
3: print("Hi there," , fn, "\n”)
FIGURE 10.3 Your first Python script.
Let’s cover what each line in the script means:
 1: This is called the shebang line, and it simply instructs Linux as to where to find the
Python executable program file. This is useful so you can invoke the Python interpreter
from whatever present working directory you may be in at a given time.
 2: This creates a variable named fn that stores the user’s response to the question string
“What is your first name?” A variable is simply a temporary, in-memory placeholder
for data. Because Python is a dynamically typed language, you don’t have to specify the
data type for our new variable; the interpreter sees that you are obtaining string data and
formats the variable accordingly.
The input function is used to solicit feedback from the user. The input parameter is
simply the prompt string. Notice that I added an extra space after the question mark and
before the closing quotes—this is to make the question and the user’s response more
legible.
 3: This command invokes the print function to present a dynamic string to the user. Use the
comma inside the print function arguments to concatenate, or combine, multiple strings.
Note that in this example the line concatenates three discrete elements:
 The static string “Hi there,”
 The current value of the fn variable
 A newline character
Escape sequences are used in Python to send internal commands to the Python
interpreter. The \n escape character (all escape characters begin with the backslash, by the
way) tells Python to insert a new line at that point.
