selected CAPTCHAs of the late 2009 variant. We scored
the answers returned using the same algorithm that re-
Captcha uses by default. reCaptcha images consist of
two words, a control word for which the correct solu-
tion is known, and the other a word for which the solu-
tion is unknown (the service is used to opportunistically
implement human-based OCR functionality for difﬁcult
words). By default reCaptcha will mark a solution as cor-
rect if it is within an edit distance of one of the control
word. However, while we know the ground truth for both
words in our tests, we do not know which was the control
word. Thus, we credited the solver with half a correct so-
lution for each word it solved correctly in the CAPTCHA,
reasoning that there was a 50% chance of each word be-
ing the control word.
We observed an accuracy of 30% for the 2008-era test
set and 18% for the 2009-era test set using the default
setting of 613 iterations,4 far lower than the average hu-
man accuracy for the same challenges (75–90% in our
experiments).
Finally, we measured the overhead of reCaptchaOCR.
On a laptop using a 2.13-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo each so-
lution required an average of 105 seconds. By reducing
the number of iterations to 75 we could reduce the solv-
ing time to 12 seconds per CAPTCHA, which is in line
with the response time for a human solver. At this num-
ber of iterations, reCaptchaOCR still achieved similar ac-
curacies: 29% for the 2008-era CAPTCHAs and 17% for
the 2009-era CAPTCHAs.
3.2 Economics
Both of these examples illustrate the inherent challenges
in ﬁelding commercial CAPTCHA-solving software.
While the CAPTCHA problem is often portrayed in
academia as a technical competition between CAPTCHA
designers and computer vision experts, this perspective
does not capture the business realities of the CAPTCHA-
solving ecosystem. Arms races in computer security
(e.g., anti-virus, anti-spam, etc.) traditionally favor the
adversary, largely because the attacker’s role is to gen-
erate new instances while the defender must recognize
them—and the recognition problem is almost always
much harder. However, CAPTCHAs reverse these roles
since Web sites can be agile in their use of new CAPTCHA
types, while attackers own the more challenging recog-
nition problem. Thus, the economics of automated solv-
ing are driven by several factors: the cost to develop new
solvers, the accuracy of these solvers and the responsive-
ness of the sites whose CAPTCHAs are attacked.
While it is difﬁcult to precisely quantify the develop-
ment cost for new solvers, it is clear that highly skilled
labor is required and such developers must charge com-
mensurate fees to recoup their time investment. Anecdo-
tally, we contacted one such developer who was offering
an automated solving library for the current reCaptcha
CAPTCHA. He was charging $6,500 on a non-exclusive
basis, and we did not pay to test this solver.
At the same time, as we saw with reCaptchaOCR, it
can be particularly difﬁcult to produce automated solvers
that can deliver human-comparable accuracy (especially
for “high-value” CAPTCHAs). While it seems that accu-
racy should be a minor factor since the cost of attempt-
ing a CAPTCHA is all but “free”, in reality low success
rates limit both the utility of a solver and its useful life-
time. In particular, over short time scales, many forums
will blacklist an IP address after 5–7 failed attempts.
More importantly, should a solver be put into wide use,
changes in the gross CAPTCHA success rate over longer
periods (e.g., days) is a strong indicator that a software
solver is in use—a signature savvy sites use to revise
their CAPTCHAs in turn.5
Thus, for a software solver to be proﬁtable, its price
must be less than the total value that can be extracted
4The solver performs multiple iterations and uses the majority so-
lution to improve its accuracy.
5We are aware that some well-managed sites already have alterna-
tive CAPTCHAs ready for swift deployment in just such a situation.

in the useful lifetime before the solver is detected and
the CAPTCHA changed. Moreover, for this approach to
be attractive, it must also cost less than the alterna-
tive: using a human CAPTCHA-solving service. To make
this tradeoff concrete, consider the scenario in which a
CAPTCHA-solving service provider must choose between
commissioning a new software solver (e.g., for a variant
of a popular CAPTCHA) or simply outsourcing recogni-
tion piecemeal to human laborers. If we suppose that it
costs $10,000 to implement a solver for a new CAPTCHA
type with a 30% accuracy (like reCaptchaOCR), then it
would need to be used over 65 million times (20 mil-
lion successful) before it was a better strategy than sim-
ply hiring labor at $0.5/1,000.6 However, the evidence
from reCaptcha’s response to reCaptchaOCR suggests
that CAPTCHA providers are well able to respond before
such amortization is successful. Indeed, in our interview,
MR. E said that he had dabbled with automated solving
but that new solvers stopped working too quickly. In his
own words, “It is a big waste of time.”
For these reasons, software solvers appear to have
been relegated to a niche status
in the solving
ecosystem—focusing on those CAPTCHAs that are static
or change slowly in response to pressure. While a tech-
nological breakthrough could reverse this state of affairs,
for now it appears that human-based solving has come to
dominate the commercial market for service.
4 Human Solver Services
Since CAPTCHAs are only intended to obstruct au-
tomated solvers,
their design point can be entirely
sidestepped by outsourcing the task to human labor
pools, either opportunistically or on a “for hire” basis. In
this section, we review the evolution of this labor market,
its basic economics and some of the underlying ethical
issues that informed our subsequent measurement study.
4.1 Opportunistic Solving
Opportunistic human solving relies on convincing an in-
dividual to solve a CAPTCHA as part of some other un-
related task. For example, an adversary controlling ac-
cess to a popular Web site might use its visitors to op-
6Moreover, human labor is highly ﬂexible and can be used for the
wide variety of CAPTCHAs demanded by customers, while a software
solver inevitably is specialized to one particular CAPTCHA type.

portunistically solving third-party CAPTCHAs by offer-
ing these challenges as its own [1, 8]. A modern vari-
ant of this approach has recently been employed by the
Koobface botnet, which asks infected users to solve a
CAPTCHA (under the guise of a Microsoft system man-
agement task) [13]. However, we believe that retention
of these unwitting solvers will be difﬁcult due to the high
proﬁle nature and annoyance of such a strategy, and we
do not believe that opportunistic solving plays a major
role in the market today.
4.2 Paid Solving
Our focus is instead on paid labor, which we believe now
represents the core of the CAPTCHA-solving ecosystem,
and the business model that has emerged around it. Fig-
ure 3 illustrates a typical workﬂow and the business rela-
tionships involved.
The premise underlying this approach is that there ex-
ists a pool of workers who are willing to interactively
solve CAPTCHAs in exchange for less money than the
solutions are worth to the client paying for their services.
The earliest description we have found for such a re-
lationship is in a Symantec Blog post from September
2006 that documents an advertisement for a full-time
CAPTCHA solver [20]. The author estimates that the re-
sulting bids were equivalent to roughly one cent per
CAPTCHA solved, or $10/1,000 (solving prices are com-
monly expressed in units of 1,000 CAPTCHAs solved).
Starting from this date, one can ﬁnd increasing num-
bers of such advertisements on “work-for-hire” sites such
as getafreelancer.com, freelancejobsearch.com, and mis-
tersoft.com. Shortly thereafter, retail CAPTCHA-solving
services began to surface to resell such capabilities to a
broad range of customers.
Moreover, a fairly standard business model has
emerged in which such retailers aggregate the demand
for CAPTCHA-solving services via a public Web site
and open API. The example in Figure 3 shows the
DeCaptcher service performing this role in steps 
and . In addition, these retailers aggregate the sup-
ply of CAPTCHA-solving labor by actively recruiting
individuals to participate in both public and private
Web-based “job sites” that provide online payments for
CAPTCHAs solved. PixProﬁt, a worker aggregator for the
DeCaptcher service, performs this role in steps – in
the example.
Figure 3: CAPTCHA-solving market workﬂow:  GYC Automator attempts to register a Gmail account and is challenged with a
Google CAPTCHA.  GYC uses the DeCaptcher plug-in to solve the CAPTCHA at $2/1,000.  DeCaptcher queues the CAPTCHA

PixProﬁt, which  returns it to the plug-in.  GYC then enters the solution for the CAPTCHA to Gmail to register the account.
4.3 Economics
While the market for CAPTCHA-solving services has
expanded,
the wages of workers solving CAPTCHAs
have been declining. A cursory examination of histori-
cal advertisements on getafreelancer.com shows that, in
2007, CAPTCHA solving routinely commanded wages as
high as $10/1,000, but by mid-2008 a typical offer had
sunk to $1.5/1,000, $1/1,000 by mid-2009, and today
$0.75/1,000 is common, with some workers earning as
little as $0.5/1,000.
This downward price pressure reﬂects the commodity
nature of CAPTCHA solving. Since solving is an unskilled
activity, it can easily be sourced, via the Internet, from
the most advantageous labor market—namely the one
with the lowest labor cost. We see anecdotal evidence of
precisely this pattern as advertisers switched from pur-
suing laborers in Eastern Europe to those in Bangladesh,
China, India and Vietnam (observations further corrobo-
rated by our own experimental results later).
Moreover, competition on the retail side exerts
pressure for all such employers to reduce their wages
in turn. For example, here is an excerpt from a recent
announcement at typethat.biz, the “worker side” of one
such CAPTCHA-solving service:
009-12-14 13:54 Admin post
Hello, as you could see, server was unstable
last days. We can’t get more captchas
because of too high prices in comparison
with other services. To solve this problem,
unfortunately we have to change the rate,
on Tuesday it will be reduced.
6
Shortly thereafter, typethat.biz reduced their offered
rate from $1/1,000 to $0.75/1,000 to stay competitive.
These changes reﬂect similar decreases on the re-
tail side: the customer cost to have 1,000 CAPTCHAs
solved is now commonly $2/1,000 and can be as low as
$1/1,000. To protect prices, a number of retailers have
tried to tie their services to third-party products with
varying degrees of success. For example, GYC Automa-
tor is a popular “black hat” bulk account creator for
Gmail, Yahoo and Craigslist; Figure 3 shows GYC’s
role in the CAPTCHA ecosystem, with the tool scrap-
ing a CAPTCHA in step  and supplying a CAPTCHA
solution in step . GYC has a relationship with the
CAPTCHA-solving service Image2Type (not to be con-
fused with ImageToType). Similarly, SENuke is a blog
and forum spamming product that has integral sup-
port for two “up-market” providers, BypassCaptcha and
BeatCaptchas. In both cases, this relationship allows
the CAPTCHA-solving services to charge higher rates:
roughly $7/1,000 for BypassCaptcha and BeatCaptchas,
and over $20/1,000 for Image2Type. It also provides an
ongoing revenue source for the software developer. For
his service, MR. E conﬁrms that software partners bring
in many customers (indeed, they are the majority revenue
source) and that he offers a variety of revenue sharing op-
tions to attract such partners.
However, such large price differences encourage arbi-
trage, and in some cases third-party developers have cre-
ated plug-ins to allow the use of cheaper services on such
packages. Indeed, in the case of GYC Automator, an in-
dependent developer built a DeCaptcher plug-in which
DeCaptcher (Customer Front End)PixProfit (Worker Back End)demenoba17236demenoba54reduced the solving cost by over an order of magnitude.
This development has created an ongoing conﬂict be-
tween the seller of GYC Automator and the distributor of
the DeCaptcher plug-in. Other software developers have
chosen to forgo large margin revenue sharing in favor of
service diversity. For example, modern versions of the
Xrumer package can use multiple price-leading services
(Antigate and CaptchaBot).
Finally, while it is challenging to measure proﬁtability
directly, we have one anecdotal data point. In our discus-
sions with MR. E, whose service is in the middle of the
price spectrum, he indicated that routinely 50% of his
revenue is proﬁt, roughly 10% is for servers and band-
width, and the remainder is split between solving labor
and incentives for partners.
4.4 Active Measurement Issues
The remainder of our paper focuses on active measure-
ment of such services, both by paying for solutions and
by participating in the role of a CAPTCHA-solving la-
borer. The security community has become increasingly
aware of the need to consider the legal and ethical context
of its actions, particularly for such active involvement,
and we brieﬂy consider each in turn for this project.
In the United States (we restrict our brief discussion to
U.S. law since that is where we operate), there are sev-
eral bodies of law that may impinge on CAPTCHA solv-
ing. First, even though the services being protected are
themselves “free”, it can be argued that CAPTCHAs are
an access control mechanism and thus evading them ex-
ceeds the authorization granted by the site owner, in po-
tential violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
(and certainly of their terms of service). While this in-
terpretation is debatable, it is a moot point for our study
since we never make use of solved CAPTCHAs and thus
never access any of the sites in question. A trickier issue
is raised by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s anti-
circumvention clause. While there are arguments that
CAPTCHA solvers provide a real use outside circumven-
tion of copyright controls (e.g., as aids for the visually
impaired) it is not clear—especially in light of increas-
ingly common audio CAPTCHA options—that such a de-
fense is sufﬁcient to protect infringers. Indeed, Ticket-
master recently won a default judgment against RMG
Technologies (who sold automated software to bypass
the Ticketmaster CAPTCHA) using just such an argu-
ment [2]. That said, while one could certainly apply the
DMCA against those offering a service for CAPTCHA-
solving purposes, it seems a stretch to include individual
human workers as violators since any such “circumven-
tion” would include innate human visual processes.
Aside from potential legal restrictions, there are also
related ethical concerns; one can do harm without such
actions being illegal. In considering these questions, we
use a consequentialist approach – comparing the con-
sequences of our intervention to an alternate world in
which we took no action — and evaluate the outcome
for its cost-beneﬁt tradeoff.
On the purchasing side, we impart no direct impact
since we do not actually use the solutions on their respec-
tive sites. We do have an indirect impact however since,
through purchasing services, we are providing support
to both workers and service providers. In weighing this
risk, we concluded that the indirect harm of our relatively
small investment was outweighed by the beneﬁts that
come from better understanding the nature of the threat.
On the solving side, the ethical questions are murkier
since we understand that solutions to such CAPTCHAs
