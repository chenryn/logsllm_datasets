## Introduction to Crisis Response Management Operations

Crisis situations can arise unexpectedly—a critical supply chain partner may suddenly cease operations, an earthquake might hit your primary operational hub, or breaking news about your organization could go viral on social media. How you handle these crises will significantly impact the perception of your brand among current and potential customers.

The reality is that another crisis or existential threat is always looming. Without a well-established Crisis Response process and dedicated team, your organization is at high risk of failure. Even if you have a process and team in place, continuous improvement and iteration are essential to avoid mistakes that could cause irreparable damage to your brand.
