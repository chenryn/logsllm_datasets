Figure 10: Encryption performance metrics for 10 second trials of 32 bytes messages in the
WAN setting (shared send+receive 40Mbps, 80ms RTT) with various number of parties n
and threshold t.
Throughput. Figure 9 shows the throughput and latency of our protocols under a variety of
conﬁgurations in the LAN setting. Throughput measures the maximum number of operations
that can be performed given that each party has a single core. Throughput is an important
metric for many tasks such as a key/token server or per row database decryption.
The ΓAES protocol is the fastest by a large margin for all n ≤ 24 despite having exponential
overhead in the number of parties. For instance, encrypting 32 bytes with n = 6 and t = 4,
ΓAES achieves 1 million encryption per second while ΓDDH, the next fastest, is 2000× slower
Increasing the parameters to n = 24, t = 16, ΓAES achieves 902
with 556 encryptions.

encryptions per second while ΓDDH is still 5× slower with 173 encryptions. The protocol
DDH which achieves strong correctness incurs a 2 to 5× overhead compared to the weaker
ΓS
ΓDDH while the publicly veriﬁable variant ΓPV
DDH has, on average, 25% lower throughput.
Latency. Another important metric is latency. That is, the time from the start of an
encryption/decryption until the result is ready. Due to various system level optimization
for improved latency, the throughput and latency results shown in Figure 9 are for diﬀerent
conﬁgurations of the protocol, e.g.
less vectorization which improves latency at the cost of
a smaller throughput. ΓAES achieves sub-millisecond latency for most conﬁgurations. On
the other hand, ΓPV
DDH with its strong security guarantees achieves a latency between 10 and
100ms.
Communication.
In addition to achieving the best throughput and latency, the ΓAES
protocol has the smallest communication overhead of 32(t − 1) bytes per encryption. The
ΓDDH incurs slightly more communication with 49(t − 1) bytes per encryption while ΓS
DDH have the most communication with 148(t − 1) bytes. However, despite having
and ΓPV
comparable communication overheads, the pure symmetric-key ΓAES protocol is signiﬁcantly
faster for small n due to the use of much more eﬃcient AES operations (in contrast to
exponentiations).
DDH
Key Size. The primary advantage of the DDH-based protocols ΓDDH, ΓS
DDH is
that the key size is either constant (33 bytes) or linear in the threshold (33t bytes). The
ΓAES protocol, on the other hand, requires that each party hold roughly(cid:0)n
DDH and ΓPV
(cid:1) ≈ O(nmin(t,n−t))
keys. As such, the single benchmark machine sharing 256GB of RAM was not able to handle
signiﬁcantly more than 24 parties. For instance, with n = 6, t = 4 each party must hold 80
bytes of key while the case of n = 24, t = 16 requires each party to hold a 8MB key. In
the worst case of t = n/2 with n = 24, the key size increases to 22MB per party. However,
despite this exponential blowup, the ΓAES can gracefully handle cases where n is small or the
threshold t is near 2 or n as shown in the bottom half of Figure 9.
t
WAN Performance. To measure the performance of the protocols over the Internet, we
benchmark on a (simulated) network with a shared bandwidth of 40 Mbps and an 80ms
round-trip time.
As shown in Figure 10, the bandwidth restriction limits the throughput of the ΓAES proto-
col due to it easily saturating the network. With n = 6, t = 2, we observe that the throughput
drops 7× to 153,332 encryption per second. However, this is near optimal given that sim-
ply communicating κ bits requires 37 out of the 40Mbps bandwidth limit. Additionally, the
latency of the ΓAES is near the optimal of 80ms in most cases. The ΓDDH protocol require
slightly more time of roughly 90ms in most cases while the strongly-correct ΓPV
protocols require between 95 and 170ms.
