### Signal Quality and Phase Measurements
When the signal drops below 3 dB, phase measurements become significantly less reliable. To maintain high localization accuracy at greater distances, RFly can either use a more sensitive receiver or design a relay with enhanced isolation.

### Related Work
A natural question is whether other approaches can address the challenges of long-range communication and localization for battery-free networks. Previous literature has explored relay designs, long-range backscatter communication, and localization. However, unlike RFly, these proposals do not solve these problems for today's commercial passive RFID tags, leaving out the billions of RFID tags already in use. Below, we describe how RFly relates to past research in each of these areas.

#### Relay Designs
Relays, often called signal boosters or repeaters, have traditionally been designed to increase communication range or throughput between a client and an access point or cellular base station [15, 21, 29, 36, 52]. Unlike previous relay designs, RFly introduces the first phase-preserving and bidirectionally full-duplex relay. The loss of phase and timing information is acceptable for existing relays, as they are intended solely for communication. For RFly, preserving phase and timing information is crucial for accurate localization.

Past full-duplex relay proposals fall into two categories: analog and digital [29]. Analog designs simply amplify and transmit packets [39], but they suffer from self-interference and require large physical separation (and often occlusions like walls) between antennas to overcome this interference [18, 39]. In contrast, RFly’s intelligent filtering and mirrored architecture allow us to embed the entire design on a miniature circuit, which can be mounted on a drone. Digital full-duplex relays, which involve some form of digital processing of packet symbols [15, 21, 38], result in the loss of phase and timing information. RFly’s relay, however, preserves phase and timing information on both uplink and downlink channels, enabling it to localize RFID tags through the relay.

#### RF-Based Localization
RF-based localization is a well-studied area in wireless networking, with over two decades of academic research [10, 14, 24, 45, 46, 48]. Past proposals have demonstrated the ability to localize active transmitters (such as WiFi [24, 44, 48] or active tags [27]) and battery-free nodes (such as RFID tags [45, 46]). Active transmitters can operate over longer ranges, while passive RFID tags, lacking batteries, have a limited communication range of a few centimeters to a few meters. RFly’s relay design and localization algorithm enable localization at distances 10 times longer than state-of-the-art RFID localization proposals.

Algorithmically, RFly is inspired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) [17, 28, 45]. Specifically, we leverage the drone’s motion to emulate an antenna array. We introduce two primary innovations over past systems: a new relay design that enables a reader to capture the phase of the signal, and a new localization algorithm that can operate on RF signals obtained through the relay by intelligently disentangling phase measurements, as described in §5.1.

#### Longer-Range Backscatter Communication
RFly is also related to non-localization systems that enable backscatter devices to communicate over long ranges. These proposals either require bulky and expensive battery-powered RFID tags [35, 51] or new backscatter hardware. In contrast, our system operates with passive off-the-shelf RFID tags, which cost a few cents and are widely deployed and adopted by the industry [33]. This is possible because our relay is designed to act as a transparent intermediary for RFID communications.

#### Drone Solutions
Recently, startups have proposed using drones for warehouse inventory control [7, 16, 20]. By mounting a barcode reader or camera on a drone, these proposals aim to catalog items in a warehouse. The key challenge for vision-based techniques is that they only work in line-of-sight environments, missing most objects in tightly packed warehouses. RFly, by relying on RF signals, can localize objects even if they are occluded from its field of view.

Another body of work has experimented with mounting an entire RFID reader on a drone and flying it in outdoor fields to detect RFID tags within its radio range [7, 30, 40]. However, due to the weight of RFID readers and their large antennas, these proposals require larger, powerful drones, which are unsafe to operate near humans. RFly differs from these systems in both technology and capability. Technologically, it introduces a low-power, low-weight relay design that can be mounted on small, light drones. In terms of capability, it not only detects RFID tags within its radio range but also accurately localizes them to within tens of centimeters.

### Discussion and Limitations
RFly demonstrates new possibilities for bringing ubiquitous connectivity and localization to battery-free networks. However, our current prototype has several limitations that need to be addressed in future work:

- **Reliance on Vision-Based Systems:** Our current evaluation relies on vision-based systems for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and stability. Future research could leverage RF for drone self-localization and apply SAR equations on the channel of the reader-relay half-link, as described in §5.2. It would also be interesting to explore using RF signals for imaging indoor environments and aiding in obstacle avoidance.
- **Operation Range:** The system’s range is currently limited to 55 meters due to self-interference cancellation. To cover a larger area, one could improve the design of cancellation circuits and algorithms by building on past work in full-duplex designs [15, 38] or MIMO techniques [11].
- **Swarm Extension:** RFly currently operates with a single drone. Future research could explore designs that daisy-chain drone-based relays to extend the range of operation. The phase-preserving characteristics may also be leveraged by the drones to localize other drones in cluttered environments.

Despite these limitations, RFly marks an important step toward enabling long-range communication and localization in battery-free networks. It motivates new directions in networking research that combine the agility of drones with the sensing capability of RF signals and inspires new relay designs that enable communication, sensing, and localization beyond the realm of battery-free networks.
