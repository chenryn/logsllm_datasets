drops below 3dB, making the phase measurements significantly less
reliable. Thus, by using a more sensitive receiver or designing a
relay with more isolation, RFly would be able to maintain its high
localization accuracy at further distances.
8 RELATED WORK
A natural question is whether there are other approaches that can
solve the problems of long-range communication and localization for
battery-free networks? Past literature has explored the topics of relay
designs, long-range backscatter communication, and localization.
However, in contrast to RFly, none of the past proposals can solve
these problems for today’s commercial passive RFIDs, leaving out
the billions of RFIDs already produced and deployed. Below, we
described how RFly relates to past literature in each of these areas.
Relay designs. Relays (often called signal boosters or repeaters)
have been traditionally designed to increase communication range
or throughput between a client and an access point or cellular base

stations [15, 21, 29, 36, 52]. In contrast to all past relay designs,
RFly introduces the first phase-preserving and bidirectionally full-
duplex relay. Note that the loss of phase and timing information
is benign for existing relays since they were intended purely for
communication purposes rather than for localization. However, it is
critical for RFly’s relay to preserve phase and timing information in
order to localize the RFIDs.
Past full-duplex relay proposals fall into two categories: ana-
log and digital [29]. Analog designs simply amplify and transmit
the packets [39]. As such, they suffer from the problem of self-
interference and they require large physical separation (and often
occlusions like walls) between the antennas to overcome that in-
terference [18, 39].8 In contrast to these designs, RFly’s intelligent
filtering and mirrored architecture allow us to embed the entire de-
sign on a miniature circuit, which we can mount on a drone. The
second category of full-duplex relays are digital – i.e., require some
form of digital processing of the packet symbols [15, 21, 38], which
results in the loss of phase and timing information. In contrast to
these past proposals, RFly’s relay preserves phase and timing in-
formation on both the uplink and downlink channels, enabling it to
localize RFIDs through the relay.
RF-based localization is a classical area of research in wireless
networking spanning over two decades of academic research [10, 14,
24, 45, 46, 48]. Past proposals have demonstrated the ability to local-
ize active transmitters (such as WiFi [24, 44, 48] or active tags [27])
and battery-free nodes (such as RFIDs [45, 46]). In contrast to active
transmitters which can operate over a longer range, passive RFIDs
have no batteries; hence, their communication range is limited to
within few centimeters to few meters. RFly’s relay design and local-
ization algorithm enable localization at distances 10× longer than
past state-of-the-art RFID localization proposals.
Algorithmically, RFly is inspired by past proposals in synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) [17, 28, 45]. Specifically, we leverage the
drone’s motion and exploit the fact that the drone’s trajectory emu-
lates an antenna array. We introduce two primary innovations over all
past systems. First, since indoor drones cannot carry an RFID reader,
we introduce a new relay design that enables a reader to capture
the phase of the signal. And second, we develop a new localization
algorithm that can operate on RF signals obtained through the relay
by intelligently disentangling the phase measurements as described
in §5.1.
Longer-Range backscatter communication. RFly is also related
to non-localization systems that enable backscatter devices to com-
municate over a long range. These proposals either require bulky and
expensive battery-powered RFIDs,9 or they require designing new
backscatter hardware [35, 51]. In contrast, our system operates with
passive off-the-shelf RFIDs which cost few cents and are widely
deployed and adopted by the industry [33]. This is possible since our
relay is designed to operate as transparent intermediary for RFID
communications.
Drone Solutions. Recently, few startups have proposed leveraging
drones in warehouse inventory control [7, 16, 20]. By mounting a
barcode reader or a camera on a drone, these proposals aim to fly
8Without such separation, these proposals cannot amplify too much.
9Active RFIDs cost 100 − 1000× more than passive RFIDs [13].
a drone around a warehouse to catalog the various items. The key
challenge facing these vision-based techniques is that they can only
work in line-of-sight environments; hence, they would miss most
objects in a warehouse since items are tightly packed together. In
contrast, by relying on RF signals, RFly can localize objects even if
they are occluded from its field of view.
Another body of work has experimented with mounting an entire
RFID reader on a drones and flying in outdoor fields to detect the
RFIDs within its radio range [7, 30, 40]. However, because RFID
readers and their large antennas are heavy, these proposals require
larger, powerful drones (similar to delivery drones), which are unsafe
to operate near humans. As such, these proposals have either been
deployed in outdoor yards [7] or have been tested in safeguarded
environments with no humans around. RFly differs from these past
systems in technology and capability. Technologically, it introduces
a new relay design that is low-power and low-weight and can be
mounted on small, light drones. In terms of capability, it not only
detects RFIDs within its radio range but accurately localizes them to
within tens of centimeters.
9 DISCUSSION & LIMITATIONS
RFly demonstrates new possibilities for bringing ubiquitous connec-
tivity and localization to battery-free networks. However, our current
prototype still has few limitations that are left for future work:
• Reliance on vision-based systems: Our current evaluation
relies on vision-based systems for navigation, obstacle avoid-
ance, and stability. In particular, we place infrared-reflective
markers on the drone and require it to remain within the field
of view of the OptiTrack’s infrared cameras; hence, the drone
would need to fly high enough to remain within the cameras’
field of view. However, it is desirable to enable the drone to
operate in more challenging environments. Future research
could leverage RF for drone self-localization and apply the
SAR equations on the channel of reader-relay half-link as de-
scribed in §5.2. Moreover, it would be interesting to explore
using RF signals for imaging indoor environments and aiding
in obstacle avoidance.
• Operation Range: The system’s range is limited to 55 m
due to the extent of self-interference cancellation. To cover
a larger area, one could improve the design of cancellation
circuits and algorithms by building on past work in full-duplex
designs [15, 38] or MIMO techniques [11].
• Swarm Extension: RFly currently operates with a single drone.
It is desirable to extend the system’s operation to swarms
of drones. Future research could explore designs that daisy-
chain the drone-based relays (as discussed in §4) to extend
the range of operation. The phase-preserving characteristics
may also be leveraged by the drones to localize other drones
in cluttered environments.
Despite these limitations, RFly marks an important step toward
enabling long-range communication and localization in battery-free
networks. More importantly, it motivates new directions in network-
ing research that combine the agility of drones with the sensing
capability of RF signals. It also motivates new relay designs that
enable communication, sensing, and localization beyond the realm
of battery-free networks.
