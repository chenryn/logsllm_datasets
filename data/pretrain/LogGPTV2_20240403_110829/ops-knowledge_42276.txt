User: I'd like to write a script (preferably in python, but other languages is not a problem), that can parse what you type into a google search. Suppose I search 'cats', then I'd like to be able to parse the string cats and, for example, append it to a .txt file on my computer. 
So if my searches were 'cats', 'dogs', 'cows' then I could have a .txt file like so,
cats
dogs
cows
Anyone know any APIs that can parse the search bar and return the string inputted? Or some object that I can cast into a string? 
EDIT: I don't want to make a chrome extension or anything, but preferably a python (or bash or ruby) script I can run in terminal that can do this. 
Thanks
Assistant: A few options you might consider, with their advantages and disadvantages:

URL: 

advantage: as Chris mentioned, accessing the URL and manually changing it is an option. It should be easy to write a script for this, and I can send you my perl script if you want
disadvantage: I am not sure if you can do it. I made a perl script for that before, but it didn't work because Google states that you can't use its services outside the Google interface. You might face the same problem

Google's search API:

advantage: popular choice. Good documentation. It should be a safe choice
disadvantage: Google's restrictions.

Research other search engines:

advantage: they might not have the same restrictions as Google. You might find some search engines that let you play around more and have more freedom in general.
disadvantage: you're not going to get results that are as good as Google's
