## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
Perhaps this is already available, but I've not been able to find it.
I love the new feature that allows me to hold `Shift` \+ `Ctrl` to snap a
window to multiple zones, but what would make it perfect is if we didn't have
to use the mouse. Is there a modifier key we can use while snapping windows
with `Win` \+ `Arrow` that will allow us to expand the window to cover the
next zone? Something like `Win` \+ `Shift` \+ `Arrow` would be fairly
intuitive.
A simple example:  
[A][B][ ]
If I have a window `B` in the middle zone selected, and I press `Win` \+
`Shift` \+ `Right`, I would end up with this:  
[A][B][B]  
Where window `B` expands to fill the next zone.
