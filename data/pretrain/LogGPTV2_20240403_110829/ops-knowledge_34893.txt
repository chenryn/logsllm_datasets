I recently installed Django and followed the basic tutorial to create a project and an app. Since the default Python version on CentOS is 2.4.3, I created a virtual environment (virtualenv) to use a more recent version. Additionally, I set up a subdomain for development purposes. However, when I attempt to access `dev.domain.com/admin/` or `dev.domain.com/`, I receive a 404 error, indicating that Django might not be running properly.

When I run the Django development server using the command:

```bash
(python2.7env)-bash-3.2# python manage.py runserver
```

I see the following output, which appears to be normal:

```plaintext
Validating models...
0 errors found
February 22, 2014 - 23:54:07
Django version 1.6.2, using settings 'ct_project.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

However, when I try to access the server via the subdomain, my browser hangs. I then used an online port scanner and discovered that port 8000 is not responding. 

**Edit:** After starting the server with the correct IP address, I encountered the same issue. The browser continued to hang, and the port scanner confirmed that port 8000 was still not responding. 

**Resolution:** The problem was resolved by contacting the support service and requesting that they open port 8000 for me.
