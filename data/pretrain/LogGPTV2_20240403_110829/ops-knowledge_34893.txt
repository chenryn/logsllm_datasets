User: I just installed Django and create a project and an app following the basic tutorial part 1, I created a virtualenv since centOS default python version is 2.4.3, I also created a subdomain to work on this for the development phase. when I try to access like dev.domain.com/admin/ or dev.domain.com/ I get a 404 error, it's like django is not even there. When I run the server I get a normal response:
(python2.7env)-bash-3.2# python manage.py runserver
Validating models...
0 errors found

Django version 1.6.2, using settings 'ct_project.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Any ideas what I'm missing? 
EDIT:after starting the server correctly(with the right ip) I tried again and as a result I got the browser hanging. Then I went to tried an online port scanner and found out that the port 8000 is not responding, any ideas what I can try next?
Thanks
Assistant: The issue was solved by contacting the support service and asking them to open the port 8000 for me.
