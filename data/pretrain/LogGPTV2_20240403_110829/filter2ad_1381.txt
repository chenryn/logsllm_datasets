## Abstract
Markov chains are widely used for modeling the behavior of computer and communication systems. A common goal of such modeling is to estimate performance and dependability measures, such as throughput, buffer occupancy, or mean time to failure. Model checking offers a different approach: instead of deriving these measures through analysis, it allows the specification and automatic verification of system requirements using temporal logic. This paper introduces the Erlangen-Twente Markov Chain Checker (ETMCC), a software tool that supports the automatic checking of performability properties specified in Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) or action-based CSL (aCSL). The tool is designed to handle finite continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) labeled with atomic propositions and/or transition names.

## Introduction
Model checking of stochastic systems has become an active area of research. The logic PCTL, an extension of Computation Tree Logic (CTL), and its associated model checking algorithms, enable the specification and verification of properties of discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) and Markov decision processes. For continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), the logic Continuous Stochastic Logic (CSL) [1, 2] has been developed. While PCTL and CSL rely on state labels with atomic properties, the logic aCSL [3] uses action-labeled transitions, which is advantageous when working with formalisms like stochastic process algebras, where the basic unit of behavior is a named action.

The Erlangen-Twente Markov Chain Checker (ETMCC) is a software tool that supports the automatic verification of performability properties expressed in CSL or aCSL. The model to be checked is a finite CTMC labeled with atomic propositions and/or transition names.

## Tool Architecture
ETMCC is implemented in Java, ensuring platform independence. It consists of several key components:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** 
   - Enables users to load, modify, and save verification projects.
   - Includes a "Property Manager" for constructing and editing properties.
   - Allows setting verification parameters and logging levels.

2. **Tool Driver:**
   - Controls the model checking procedure.
   - Generates the parse tree for the property and invokes the appropriate verification objects.

3. **Verification Objects:**
   - Encapsulate the verification algorithms.
   - Use the analysis and numerical engines to perform the necessary computations.

4. **Analysis Engine:**
   - Supports standard model checking algorithms for CTL-style until-formulas.
   - Provides graph algorithms for tasks such as computing strongly connected components.
   - Used in pre-processing for probabilistic until-formulas and for calculating steady-state properties.

5. **Numerical Engine:**
   - Offers methods for numerical analysis of CTMCs, including linear solvers and numerical integration.
   - Solves systems of linear or integral equations.

6. **State Space Manager:**
   - Represents the model in sparse matrix format.
   - Maintains information about the validity of atomic propositions and sub-formulas for each state.

## Status and Availability
ETMCC has been successfully applied in several non-trivial case studies, such as a cyclic server polling system and a multiprocessor mainframe with software failures. Its efficient numerical analysis methods enable the verification of performability properties for models with up to several million states. The tool is available free of charge for academic use at [http://www7.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/etmcc/](http://www7.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/etmcc/). The current version is 1.4. A detailed description of ETMCC can be found in [4].
