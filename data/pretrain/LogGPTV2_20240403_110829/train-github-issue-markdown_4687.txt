When working with CSV files that have irregular spacing, such as the following example:

```csv
    name,    amount
    Alice,100
    Bob,200
```

the resulting DataFrame may contain column names with leading or trailing whitespace. For instance, when loading the data using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('foo.csv')

# Display the column names
print(df.columns)
```

The output might look like this:

```python
Index(['name', '    amount'], dtype='object')
```

In such cases, it is often desirable to strip the leading and trailing whitespace from the column names. Should this be done by default, or should it be an explicit step in the data cleaning process?
