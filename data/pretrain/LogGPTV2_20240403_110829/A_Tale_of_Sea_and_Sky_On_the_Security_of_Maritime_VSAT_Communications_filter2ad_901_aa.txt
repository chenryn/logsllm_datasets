Abstract—Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) have revo-
lutionized maritime operations. However, the security dimensions
of maritime VSAT services are not well understood. Historically,
high equipment costs have acted as a barrier to entry for both
researchers and attackers. In this paper we demonstrate a sub-
stantial change in threat model, proving practical attacks against
maritime VSAT networks with less than $400 of widely-available
television equipment. This is achieved through GSExtract, a
purpose-built forensic tool which enables the extraction of IP
trafﬁc from highly corrupted VSAT data streams.
The implications of this threat are assessed experimentally
through the analysis of more than 1.3TB of real-world maritime
VSAT recordings encompassing 26 million square kilometers of
coverage area. The underlying network platform employed in
these systems is representative of more than 60% of the global
maritime VSAT services market. We ﬁnd that sensitive data
belonging to some of the world’s largest maritime companies is
regularly leaked over VSAT ship-to-shore communications. This
threat is contextualized through illustrative case studies ranging
from the interception and alteration of navigational charts to theft
of passport and credit card details. Beyond this, we demonstrate
the ability to arbitrarily intercept and modify TCP sessions under
certain network conﬁgurations, enabling man-in-the-middle and
denial of service attacks against ships at sea. The paper concludes
with a brief discussion of the unique requirements and challenges
for encryption in VSAT environments.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The maritime transportation industry has trended towards
ever-larger vessels operated by ever-smaller crews, a change
driven by the increasing digitization of modern ships. In
December, 2015 the CMA CCM Benjamin Franklin, with a
crew of merely 27 members, brought more than $985 million
worth of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles in a single visit [9],
[10]. Ships such as this have leveraged digitization to make
the maritime industry a keystone sector in the global econ-
omy, transporting more than 80% of the word’s trade goods
annually [45]. Moreover, the use of computing technology for
marine operations is expected to grow for the foreseeable fu-
ture; perhaps even progressing to fully autonomous vessels [5].
One of the critical drivers of this digitization revolution has
been improvements in ship-to-shore communications. Through
terrestrial and space-based radio transmissions, landside op-
erations centers remain connected to vessels traversing the
remotest parts of the globe. However, despite the vitality of
these connections, little research has been conducted on their
security properties. This paper makes an initial contribution
towards understanding and securing these increasingly critical
linkages.
Speciﬁcally, the paper focuses on one major ship-to-shore
communications technology: maritime Very Small Aperture
Terminal (VSAT) satellite broadband. We demonstrate that
an attacker can intercept and even modify maritime VSAT
connections using standard satellite television equipment cost-
ing less than 1% of state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, we
present a purpose built forensic tool GSExtract designed
to recover sensitive IP trafﬁc from even highly corrupted
maritime VSAT feeds collected on consumer-grade equipment.
GSExtract is used to conduct an experimental analysis
of two major maritime VSAT providers offering services to
Europe and the North Atlantic and encompassing a service
area of more than 26 million square kilometers. These two
providers rely on an underlying networking platform with more
than 60% share of the global maritime VSAT market.
We ﬁnd that status quo maritime VSAT communications
raise serious security and privacy concerns. From more than
1.3TB of real-world satellite radio recordings, we select a
series of demonstrative case studies highlighting unique threats
to maritime navigation, passenger and crew privacy, and vessel
safety. Our contributions suggest that several of the world’s
largest shipping, freight, and fossil fuel companies rely on
vulnerable VSAT networks which may be abused for the
purposes of crime, piracy, and terrorism. The paper concludes
with a brief discussion of both immediate and long-term
technical improvements which may address these issues.
II. RELATED WORK
While,
to the best of our knowledge, no experimental
analysis of maritime VSAT radio signals has been conducted
to date, a broader literature base on maritime cybersecurity
has begun to emerge. This sub-ﬁeld is well characterized by
DiRenzo et al. who synthesize a number of academic and
governmental reports and outline theoretical attacks against
several marine navigational technologies, including: Global
Positional Systems (GPS), Automatic Identiﬁcation System
(AIS), and Electronic Chart Display and Navigational System
(ECDIS) [12]. In a broad sense, the focus has primarily been on
modern nation states have the motivation to harm commercial
maritime vessels [42], [28]. Moreover, given that no state has
claimed responsibility for the act, the plausible deniability and
covert nature of cyber-operations may be particularly desirable
to state actors.
Within the maritime industry, organizations appear gener-
ally conﬁdent in their ability to defend against cyber-attacks.
A recent survey of maritime executives and cyber-security
decision-makers found that almost 70% felt that the industry
was “prepared in cybersecurity” [29]. Moreover, 100% of
representatives from large maritime companies (those with
more than 400 employees) felt that their company was already
“prepared to prevent a data breach” [29].
Very little research exists speciﬁcally concerning the se-
curity properties of maritime VSAT. Most prominent are two
conference presentations by a private security researcher from
the ﬁrm IOActive at DEFCON and Blackhat which disclosed
serious ﬁrmware vulnerabilities in the software of many widely
used VSAT routers [38], [39]. However, the research did not
extend to the radio signals transmitted to and from these
devices and did not consider the capabilities of a terrestrial
eavesdropper. Peripherally relevant research into the general
security of satellite broadband exists as well. However, this
research focuses on the MPEG-TS encoding method widely
used for terrestrial satellite broadband services and not on the
newer standards which tend to be used in specialized marine
systems [1], [35]. Given that signiﬁcant security issues have
been found in specialized multi-purpose data links in other
transportation sectors such as aviation a closer look at VSAT
radio signals is likely warranted [41].
The relative lack of research on maritime VSAT security
may arise in part because the dominant service providers tend
to leverage more complex transmission modes (e.g. 16 or
32APSK modulation) and more recent protocols (e.g. Generic
Stream Encapsulation or GSE) compared to traditional satellite
broadband [16]. While many open source and freely avail-
able tools exist for interpreting MPEG-TS recordings, to our
knowledge no comparable software exists for GSE [11], [8].
Additionally, the equipment sold to maritime VSAT customers
to receive and interpret these signals (such as the system in
Figure 1) can cost upwards of $50,000 [21]. These high costs
act as a signiﬁcant barrier to entry for researchers.
III. BACKGROUND
A. Uses for Maritime VSAT
By enabling ships to remain connected to terrestrial com-
puter networks, wherever they may be, VSAT has been a
key driver of digitization. The speciﬁc utility of VSAT de-
pends highly on the purpose of a given ship. For example, a
cruise operator might use VSAT to provide broadband internet
connectivity to their passengers whilst a ﬁshing vessel might
leverage cloud-based analysis of ﬁshing yield data [47], [31].
There are, however, several common use cases for VSAT
connectivity with broad applicability [21]. For example, marine
transportation is highly regulated and VSAT services allow
ships across sectors to communicate with port authorities, and
land-based regulatory experts, far in advance of arrival. More-

the impact of system compromise rather than the mechanism
by which that compromise might occur.
Some practical consideration of attack vectors can be found
in literature relating to GPS security. For example, in 2013
researchers at the University of Texas, Austin demonstrated
the ability to spoof GPS position readings aboard the White
Rose of Drax, a luxury yacht [3]. They further suggested that
attackers might take advantage of GPS subsystems to alter
ship coordinates and even hijack vessels. Reports of GNSS
spooﬁng by Russian authorities in the Black Sea suggest that
such attacks have been put into practice [6]. Beyond maritime,
a much wider body of research surrounding the general topic
of GPS spooﬁng and countermeasures exists [40].
With regards to AIS, a near-universally deployed maritime
location reporting and collision prevention system, there is
signiﬁcant interest both within academic and hobbyist circles.
Radio communities have emerged using software-deﬁned ra-
dios to record AIS signals and develop open source maps
tracking maritime trafﬁc [33], [30]. Moreover, security-focused
research has identiﬁed a number of vulnerabilities in AIS
environments
including the ability to create non-existent
vessels or false collision incidents [2].
In a less technical context, some work has been done
to identify threat actors with motivation to harm maritime
targets via cyber-mediated attacks. For example, Jones et al.
contend that terrorist organizations might view a disabled or
impaired oil tanker as a powerful weapon [27]. Furthermore,
given the high value of typical cargo payloads (on the scale
hundreds of millions of dollars), information systems aboard
ever more automated freight vessels may become targets of
pirates [26], [20]. The recent kinetic attacks against Japanese
and Norwegian oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, almost univer-
sally attributed to state-sponsored adversaries, demonstrate that

enable maritime companies to maintain situational awareness
as to the state of their ﬂeet, provide remote expert support, and
optimize fuel efﬁciency and scheduling in response to weather
changes [44], [21]. Finally, VSAT connectivity enables critical
safety and navigational aids ranging from remote medical
support to up-to-date navigational charts [21].
B. VSAT Network Architectures
To some extent, the term “VSAT” is a misnomer. While
the acronym suggests “very small” terminals, products ex-
ceeding the size of automobiles are regularly sold as VSAT
hardware [23]. Moreover, from a communications protocol
perspective, the VSAT designation means very little. VSAT
service operators use a wide range of protocols, many propri-
etary and undocumented, and generalizations applicable to the
entire VSAT industry are difﬁcult if not impossible.
Within the maritime context, however, VSAT services are
more standardized due to the global nature of the shipping
industry. Satellite service operators in one region of the world
will enter into sub-licensing agreements with operators in other
regions to provide global coverage and this requires the use of
inter-operable protocols. For example, both of the providers
considered in this paper rely on an underlying networking
technology stack used in more than 1,200 VSAT networks
globally and with more than 60% market share in the maritime
domain [22].
In this paper, we focus on satellite networks operating
from geostationary earth orbit (GEO). When contrasted with
low earth orbit (LEO), geostationary networks offer two main
advantages for maritime VSAT. First, because the satellites
appear stationary relative to a ﬁxed point on the earth’s surface,
receiving a signal is simpler than in LEO networks where
satellites frequently pass over the horizon. Moreover, GEO
satellites operate from an altitude of more than 30,000 km
which enables vast coverage areas measuring millions of
square kilometers from a single satellite. These wide coverage
footprints are particularly attractive to maritime customers
operating in remote ocean waters. The principal disadvantage
of GEO networks is that the long distances involved create
speed-of-light delays that increase network latency.

network. The attacker in the diagram can eavesdrop on trafﬁc
from step 6 but has limited visibility into trafﬁc at all other
stages.
A maritime VSAT network is not signiﬁcantly different
from other satellite networking environments with respect to
its basic architecture. As outlined in Figure 2, the customer

sends web requests up to their provider’s satellite which then
relays those requests on a different frequency to a large
ground-station. This ground-station then forwards customer
requests across the open internet, receives the responses, and
relays those responses back up to the satellite which then
forwards those same responses back down to the customer.
From geostationary orbit, speed of light signal propagation
means that this process takes around 500ms in ideal conditions.
One unique aspect of eavesdropping in satellite networks
that does not hold for most other wireless networks is that
the geographic location of an attacker within the coverage
area can have signiﬁcant impacts on their ability to observe
certain signals. For example, the attacker depicted in Figure 2
can easily observe responses from the satellite internet service
provider (ISP) to the customer but would have a much more
difﬁcult time intercepting the focused uplink requests transmit-
ted by the customer. This means in our experimental analysis,
the recorded trafﬁc generally only contained “forward-link”
packets received by satellite customers but not the “reverse-
link” packets sent by customers to their ISPs. In theory, an
eavesdropper physically located near a satellite ISP could
intercept such packets, but the beams used to transmit this
portion of the connection are much narrower and have smaller
footprints than general broadcast signals. Additionally,
the
satellite to ground-station link may operate over frequencies
for which hardware is less widely available.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
A. Equipment, Targets and Recording
In order to assess the status quo state of maritime VSAT
communications privacy, we developed an experiment to col-
lect and analyze representative maritime VSAT emissions from
two major service providers one which provides maritime
services to shipping routes in the North Atlantic and one which
provides regional services in Nordic and Mediterranean waters.
An approximate map of the signal footprints involved in our
research can be seen in Figure 3.
As mentioned in section II, commercial maritime VSAT
systems are expensive. Even if an attacker had sufﬁcient funds
Attacker123456VSATCustomerInternetGround-Stationto procure an installation, these systems are not generally
sold direct to consumers but rather according a business-to-
business or “VSAT as a service” model (generally in the form
of annual contracts costing thousands of dollars monthly). As
such, an attacker might prefer to employ widely available and
inexpensive satellite television equipment.
The use of a standard home-television satellite dish and
inexpensive hobbyist satellite tuner gives rise to several issues.
Consumer grade equipment is likely both smaller and less
accurately targeted than maritime VSAT systems. This results
in lower antenna gain and lower singal-to-noise ratios. The
effect is that many frames will be lost in the signal processing
stages. Moreover, the tuner hardware itself normally an FPGA
or ASIC based demodulator may fail to maintain an acceptable
rate of throughput when interpreting more complicated mod-
ulations. In maritime VSAT, 16 and 32-APSK modulations
are widely employed for high-bandwidth connections. This
contrasts with simpler QPSK and 8PSK modulations dominant
in the terrestrial ecosystem and consumer-grade hardware.
Despite these issues, we hypothesize that a resource-poor
attacker may nevertheless be able to intercept, demodulate,
and interpret maritime VSAT streams. This is because an
eavesdropper does not necessarily need 100% reliability to
pose a threat, even if an eavesdropper misses half of all
packets, the small portion which they do intercept may contain
sensitive information. In order to test this theory, we restricted
our experimental equipment
to widely-available consumer-
grade products with a total cost of less than $400 (Table I).
