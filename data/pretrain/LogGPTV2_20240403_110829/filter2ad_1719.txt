## Abstract
This study investigates how users interact with and respond to various internet threats, including exploit links, risky files, and malware. By examining user behavior, we aim to understand the "human aspect" of cybersecurity and provide insights into how users evaluate and assess risks.

## Problem
Internet attacks often involve:
- Exploit links
- Risky files
- Malware
- Warning messages

User interactions can include:
- Clicking on links
- Downloading files
- Running executable files
- Dismissing warnings

## Previous Work
Previous research has explored:
- How attackers trick users
- The techniques used by attackers
- The success rates of these attacks

Notable studies include:
- Dhamija, CHI '06
- Sunshine, SSYM '09
- Egelman, CHI '08
- Friedman, CHI '02
- And many more

Additionally, there is a focus on the usability of security solutions.

## Our Questions
- How do users react to current threats such as XSS, session fixation, exploit links, file-sharing scams, and malicious trick banners?
- How do users evaluate the security implications of their actions?
- How do users assess the risk associated with these threats?

## Experiment
We conducted an online test system with 44 security-related scenarios divided into three suites:
- Web attacks
- Email attacks
- File-sharing attacks

## Contributions
- 164 participants
- The largest study to date on prevalent attacks
- Insights into user perception and security
- Understanding of decision-making cues
- Identification of common attack vectors

## Experiment Design
- **Perception Score:** "How dangerous or safe do you think clicking on this link is?"
- **Security Score:** "Would you click on this link?"
- Participants were asked to explain their reasoning.

## Web Attacks
- Scenarios included XSS, session fixation, and link manipulation tricks.
- Examples of benign URLs, raw IP addresses, and TinyURLs were provided.

## Email Attacks
- Scenarios involved .exe attachments, phishing, 419 scams, prize giveaways, newsletters, and banking emails.

## File-Sharing Attacks
- Scenarios included BitTorrent and other file-sharing platforms like The Pirate Bay, Torrentz, and Megaupload.
- Cues considered: filename, download contents, size, date, uploader, comments, extensions, etc.

## Trick Banners
- Scenarios involving deceptive advertisements and pop-ups.

## Participants
- 164 participants recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and personal contacts.
- Age range: 19 to 69 (Mean: 26.5)
- 17 nationalities
- Educational backgrounds: CS, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Geology, etc.
- Educational levels: PhD, Master, Bachelor, High School

## Participant Demographics
- **Experts:** 38%
- **Non-techies:** 43%
- **Techies:** 19%

## Total Scores
- **Perception Score:** Experts > Techies > Non-techies
- **Security Score:** Experts > Techies > Non-techies
- Statistical analysis: Kruskal-Wallis and Multiple comparison post-hoc tests
- H = 37.36, df = 2, p < 0.001

### Detailed Analysis
- **Web Attacks Suite:** Experts > Non-techies
- No significant difference between Experts and Non-techies in Email and File-Sharing security scenarios

## Correlation Analysis
- **Non-techies:** ρ = 0.50
- **Rest:** ρ = 0.70
- Spearman’s Rank Correlation

## Perception & Security
- Non-techies have poor perception but still manage to avert attacks.
- Exposure:
  - Spam: 95.7%
  - Email attacks subverted: 97.1% by intuition
  - Can this be applied to more complex attacks? (Web attacks: 48.9%)

## Misleading Cues
- **URL length & complexity:**
  - “Too long and complicated”
  - “Many funny letters”
  - “Has a long name and unknown code in it”
- **www.paypal.hostding.com:**
  - “Easy to read”
  - “Clear obvious link”
  - “[Amazon link] was not like this”

- **File size:**
  - Movie.rar cannot be 700MB
  - 700KB movie from 1922: legit
- Informed decisions are not possible; users rely on misleading cues.

## Shortened URL & IP Address
- Verify destination: Not familiar
- TinyURL: 35.7%
- IP address: 28.6%
- Examples: YouTube video, index of photographs, blog article, printer interface, proxy code, router configuration

## Conclusions
- Online test system with 44 scenarios
- 164 participants, the largest study to date
- Perception ≠ Security
- Size and length are poor indicators of security
- Shortened URLs: Tools exist, but awareness is low
- Trick banners: A serious concern
