Previous Work 
•  How do attackers trick users? 
•  What techniques do they use? 
•  How successful are they? 
–  [Dhamija, CHI ‘06]  
–  [Sunshine, SSYM ’09] 
–  [Egelman, CHI’ 08] 
–  [Friedman, CHI ‘02] 
–  ….and many more 
•  Usability of security solutions…

Our Questions 
•  How do users react to current threats? 
–  XSS, session fixation, exploit links,  
   file-sharing scams, malicious trick banners 
•  …evaluate security implications of actions? 
•  …assess the risk?

Experiment 
•  Online test system 
•  44 security-related scenarios in 3 suites 
–  Web attacks 
–  Email attacks 
–  File-sharing attacks

Contributions 
•  164 participants 
•  Largest study on prevalent attacks 
•  Gain insights into ‘Perception’ & ‘Security’ 
•  Understand decision-making cues 
•  Identify attack vectors

Experiment Design 
•  Perception Score 
–  “How dangerous or safe do you think clicking on 
this link is?” 
•  Security Score 
–  “Would you click on this link?” 
•  “Please explain your reasoning.”

Perception & Security 
•  Non-techies have bad perception 
•  …but still avert attacks! 
•  Exposure? 
–  Spam: 95.7% 
–  Email attacks subverted: 97.1% by intuition 
–  Can this be applied to more complex attacks? 
 Web attacks: 48.9%

Misleading Cues 
•  URL length & complexity: 
–  “Too long and complicated” 
–  “Many  funny letters” 
–  “Has a long name and unknown code in it” 
•  www.paypal.hostding.com: 
–  “Easy to read” 
–  “Clear obvious link” 
–  “[Amazon link] was not like this”

Misleading Cues 
•  File size: 
–  Movie.rar cannot be 700MB 
–  700KB movie from 1922: legit 
•  Informed decisions not possible 
 Rely on misleading cues

Conclusions 
•  Online test system, prevalent attacks 
•  164 participants, largest study to date 
•  Perception ≠ Security 
•  Size and length: bad cues 
•  Shortened URLs: Tools, but no awareness 
•  Trick banners: Serious business
