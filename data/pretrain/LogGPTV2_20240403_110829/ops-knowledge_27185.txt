User: I am trying to use PyPy on a Windows 7 x64 machine but do not find any way to do it.
Apparently there is a win32 binary, but no x64 binary or installation guide.
I am currently using Python 2.7.2 win64 (Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 14:24:46) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32).
Installation from sources raised the following error:

[translation:ERROR]  WindowsError: [Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application

Does anyone have a guide/hint to use PyPy on a win64?
Or is it just not possible?
Assistant: Just an update on this issue if anyone read it nowadays: PyPy seems to have solved their issues with Windows x64, you can download the 32-bit version of PyPy and it will work flawlessly under Windows 7 x64 (I even have a 64-bit python install beside, and pypy is working nicely along, I just have to specify the full path to pypy to use it for the scripts I need).
