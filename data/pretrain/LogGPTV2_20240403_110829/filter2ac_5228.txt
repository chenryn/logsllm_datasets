### Title: Black Hat US-19: All 4G Modules Are Vulnerable to Hacking

In recent years, 4G modules have become increasingly integrated into a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including vending machines, car entertainment systems, laptops, advertising displays, and urban surveillance cameras. Despite their widespread use, there has been a lack of comprehensive security research on these 4G modules. To address this gap, we conducted an in-depth study, testing over 15 different types of 4G modules from major brands available in the market.

Our findings reveal that all tested 4G modules share common vulnerabilities, such as:

- **Remote Access with Weak Passwords:** Default or easily guessable passwords allow unauthorized access.
- **Command Injection via AT Commands and Listening Services:** Malicious commands can be injected through AT command interfaces.
- **OTA Upgrade Spoofing:** Over-the-air (OTA) updates can be intercepted and replaced with malicious firmware.
- **Command Injection via SMS:** Attackers can inject commands through SMS messages.
- **Web Vulnerabilities:** Web interfaces of these modules are susceptible to various web-based attacks.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we were able to gain shell access to the devices. In addition to traditional methods like WiFi, we developed a novel attack vector using a fake base station system. This approach leverages the cellular network's intranet, enabling remote command execution without any prerequisites.

In our presentation, we will:

1. **Provide an Overview of the Hardware Structure:** We will discuss the architecture and components of 4G modules.
2. **Present Our Vulnerability Probing Methods:** We will detail the specific techniques and tools used to identify and exploit the vulnerabilities.
3. **Demonstrate Exploitation Techniques:** We will showcase how these vulnerabilities can be used to attack car entertainment systems, allowing for remote control of vehicles.

This talk aims to raise awareness about the security risks associated with 4G modules and highlight the need for more robust security measures in IoT devices.
