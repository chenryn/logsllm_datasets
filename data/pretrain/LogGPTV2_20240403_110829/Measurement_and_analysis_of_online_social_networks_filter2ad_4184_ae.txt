Group Size
Figure 10: Plot of group size and average group clus-
tering coeﬃcient. Many small groups are almost
cliques.
Finally, Figure 11 shows how user participation in groups
varies with outdegree. Low-degree nodes tend to be part of
very few communities, while high-degree nodes tend to be
members of multiple groups. This implies a correlation be-
tween the link creation activity and the group participation.
There is a sharp decline in group participation for Orkut
users with over 500 links, which is inconsistent with the be-
havior of the other networks. This result may be an artifact
of our partial crawl of the Orkut network and the resulting
biased user sample.
In general, our observations suggest a global social net-
work structure that is comprised of a large number of small,
tightly clustered local user communities held together by
nodes of high degree. This structure is likely to signiﬁcantly
impact techniques, algorithms and applications of social net-
works.
5.9 Summary
We end this section with a brief summary of important struc-
tural properties of social networks which we observed in our
data.

power-law, and the power-law coeﬃcients for both in-

Outdegree

degree and outdegree are similar. Nodes with high
indegree also tend to have high outdegree.
• Social networks appear to be composed of a large num-
ber of highly connected clusters consisting of relatively
low-degree nodes. These clusters connect to each other
via a relatively small number of high-degree nodes. As
a consequence, the clustering coeﬃcient is inversely
proportional to node degree.
• The networks each contain a large, densely connected
core. Overall, the network is held together by about
10% of the nodes with highest degree. As a result,
path lengths are short, but almost all shortest paths
of suﬃcient length traverse the highly connected core.
6. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss some implications of our ﬁndings.
Our measurements indicate that online social networks have
a high degree of reciprocity, a tight core that consists of high-
degree nodes, and a strong positive correlation in link de-
grees for connected users. What do these ﬁndings mean for
developers? Alternately, how should applications for social
networks be designed to take advantage of these properties?
Do these properties reveal straightforward attacks on the
social structure? Finally, does it make sense to “optimize”
algorithms and applications based upon our ﬁndings, since
these networks are still growing rapidly and any property
we assert now may soon change?
While our ﬁndings are likely applicable to many diﬀerent
applications, we concentrate on their eﬀect on information
dissemination, search, and trust inference.
6.1 Information dissemination and search
Social networks are already used as a means for rapidly dis-
seminating information, as witnessed by the popularity of
“hot” videos on YouTube. The existence of a small, well-
connected core implies that information seeded via a core
node will rapidly spread through the entire network. This
is both a strength and a weakness, as spam or viruses could
be disseminated this way, as well as important information.
Similarly, searches that proceed along social network links
will quickly reach the core. This suggests that simple un-
structured search algorithms could be designed if the core
users were to store some state about other users. In eﬀect,
the users in the core represent “supernodes” in a two-level hi-
erarchy, similar to existing search protocols for unstructured
networks, such as Gnutella.
6.2 Trust
Social networking sites are the portals of entry into the In-
ternet for many millions of users, and they are being used
both for advertisement as well as for the ensuing commerce.
Many of these applications, ranging from mail to auctions,
implicitly rely on some form of trust. For example, when
a user accepts email from an unknown user, she is trusting
the other party not to send spam. When a user selects a
winning bidder in an auction, she is trusting the other party
to pay the winning amount, and the winning user is trusting
the seller to produce the auctioned item.
In a social network, the underlying user graph can po-
tentially be used as a means to infer some level of trust in
an unknown user [28], to check the validity of a public key
certiﬁcate [38], and to classify potential spam [17]. In all of
these, trust is computed as a function of the path between
the source and target user.
Our ﬁndings have interesting implications for trust infer-
ence algorithms. The tight core coupled with link reciprocity
implies that users in the core appear on a large number
of short paths. Thus, if malicious users are able to pene-
trate the core, they can skew many trust paths (or appear
highly trustworthy to a large fraction of the network). How-
ever, these two properties also lead to small path lengths
and many disjoint paths, so the trust inference algorithms
should be adjusted to account for this observation. In par-
ticular, given our data, an unknown user should be highly
trusted only if multiple short disjoint paths to the user can
be discovered.
The correlation in link degrees implies that users in the
fringe will not be highly trusted unless they form direct links
to other users. The “social” aspect of these networks is self-
reinforcing:
in order to be trusted, one must make many
“friends”, and create many links that will slowly pull the
user into the core.
6.3 Temporal invariance
One possible criticism of our study is the snapshot character
of our data, which does not account for change over time. To
explore this, we repeated the entire crawl for both Flickr and
YouTube on May 7th, 2007, and recomputed the complete
statistics on the new data set. Both of the networks showed
rapid growth over this ﬁve month time period, with Flickr
growing by 38% and YouTube by 83%.
However, the salient observations in our original data are
still valid; for Flickr, most of the updated results are indis-
tinguishable from the results presented. YouTube showed a
diﬀerence due to a policy change between our original and
new crawls: YouTube switched from directed links to a two-
phase symmetric link creation process. Thus, in the new
YouTube crawl, we observe a much higher level of symme-
try and a correspondingly larger SCC. However, many of
the other metrics, such as the assortativity, clustering coef-
ﬁcient, and average path length are similar.
This experiment gives us some assurance that our struc-
tural observations are not incidental to the stage of growth
at which we sampled the network. Our data indicates that,
even though the networks are growing rapidly, their basic
structure is not changing drastically.
7. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented an analysis of the structural properties
of online social networks using data sets collected from four
popular sites. Our data shows that social networks are struc-
turally diﬀerent from previously studied networks, in partic-
ular the Web. Social networks have a much higher fraction
of symmetric links and also exhibit much higher levels of lo-
cal clustering. We have outlined how these properties may
aﬀect algorithms and applications designed for social net-
works.
Much work still remains. We have focused exclusively
on the user graph of social networking sites; many of these
sites allow users to host content, which in turn can be linked
to other users and content. Establishing the structure and
dynamics of the content graph is an open problem, the so-
lution to which will enable us to understand how content is
introduced in these systems, how data gains popularity, how
users interact with popular versus personal data, and so on.
