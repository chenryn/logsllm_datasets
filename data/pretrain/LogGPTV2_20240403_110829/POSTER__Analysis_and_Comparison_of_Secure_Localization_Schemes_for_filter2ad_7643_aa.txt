### Introduction
**Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)** is a broad and evolving field, with various components often overlapping or converging. For instance, transport and travel information can be part of a Smart Cities agenda, while "connected cars" are an example of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The GSMA believes that mobile technology is the only solution that provides the agile, robust, and secure communications required to mobilize ITS solutions. Additionally, mobile operators offer many capabilities beyond connectivity, making them attractive business partners for transport system operators.

This paper aims to provide a clear definition of the components that make up ITS and highlight the role that mobile operators can play in the strategy, design, implementation, and operation of various ITS solutions.

#### A Brief History of ITS
Research on the application of control and information technologies to surface transportation began in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, including automatic vehicle control and electronic route guidance. In the late 1980s, a coalition of private, public, and academic organizations convinced Congress to support a comprehensive program in Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (renamed Intelligent Transportation Systems or ITS in 1994) to encompass all aspects of public transportation and intermodal connections.

#### ITS Market Trends
- **Market Size**: Over 3,000 companies and 445,000 jobs in the end-use market.
- **Telematics Growth**: Solutions like Apple’s CarPlay are expected to drive growth, promoting in-vehicle apps and app integration through standardized approaches like MirrorLink.
- **Market Revenues**: ITS revenues have exceeded those for electronic computers, motion picture, video products, and internet advertising.
- **Electronic Toll Collection System**: Expected to reach $9.5 billion by 2020.
- **Key Drivers**: Optimizing fuel consumption and reducing emissions.
- **High Growth Markets**: India and China are expected to see significant growth.

#### Self-Driving Cars
Self-driving cars (autonomous vehicles) are a new "hot topic," still in the research stage but with sales forecasted to explode over the next decade. Companies like Audi, Daimler, and Google are actively developing these vehicles.

- **Market Forecast**: The global connected car market is expected to reach USD 131.9 billion by 2019, growing at 34.7% per year from 2013 to 2019.
- **Technology**: 4G/LTE is positioned to supply the necessary connectivity due to its lower operating costs, high data transmission volumes, and inherent security.

#### Public Policy
- **eCall**: An EC initiative to bring help to motorists involved in collisions by automatically sending a "Minimum Set of Data" to the nearest emergency center via the cellular network.
- **EU Action Plan**: Aims to make road transport more environmentally friendly, efficient, safer, and more secure, with coordinated deployment and standardization.

### 1. Enabling Technology and Standards in ITS

#### 1.1 Cellular Radio
Cellular radio, in its various forms (2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G), is a key enabler of new developments in ITS. 

- **Global Usage**: Almost half the world's population uses mobile communications, with 3.4 billion users by the end of 2013, expected to pass 4 billion by 2018.
- **Network Growth**: Two-thirds of subscribers will be on 3G and 4G networks by 2020, with strong M2M connections growth.
- **Connected Cars**: Penetration will increase globally from 11% in 2012 to 60% in 2017, with even higher rates in the US and Western Europe.
- **Benefits**: Real-time information, remote monitoring, improved driving experience, and automated payment systems.

#### 1.2 Embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card (eUICC)
A new type of mobile network user will emerge, with M2M communication becoming standard, primarily using mobile networks.

- **SIM Card Issue**: Traditional SIM cards are impractical for M2M applications due to accessibility and durability concerns.
- **eUICC Solution**: The eUICC (embedded SIM) allows for remote management of M2M connections, enabling over-the-air provisioning and operator changes while maintaining the same level of service.
