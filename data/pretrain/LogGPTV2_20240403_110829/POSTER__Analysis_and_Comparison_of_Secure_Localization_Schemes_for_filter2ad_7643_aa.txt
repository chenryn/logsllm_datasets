Introduction 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is an expanding and 
diverse subject, with some of its constituent parts overlapping 
or converging. For example, transport and travel information 
might been viewed under a Smart Cities agenda, and similarly 
“connected cars” are a manifestation of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) 
communications and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
The GSMA believe that mobile is the only solution that offers the 
agile, robust and secure communications required to mobilise ITS 
solutions. In addition, mobile operators have many capabilities, 
beyond connectivity, that make them attractive business partners for 
transport system operators. 
This paper seeks to provide a clear definition of the component parts 
that make up ITS and highlight the role that mobile operators can 
play in the strategy, design, implementation and operation of various 
ITS solutions. 
A brief history of ITS
Research on the application of control and information 
technologies to surface transportation began in the 1950s 
and 1960s in the United States, including automatic control 
of the automobile and electronic route guidance. In the late 
1980s a coalition of private, public and academic organisations 
convinced Congress to legislate support for a comprehensive 
program in Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (renamed 
Intelligent Transportation Systems or ITS in 1994) to reflect a 
broader mission, including all parts of public transportation and 
intermodal connections.

A new “hot topic” is “self-driving cars” (aka autonomous vehicles), still in the research stage but sales are forecast to explode over the 
next decade. Automotive and other companies are racing to develop them, including Audi, Daimler, Google. 
■■ According to an October 2013 market report from Transparency Market Research “Connected Car Market 
-Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2013- 2019,” the global connected 
car market will reach USD 131.9 billion by 2019, growing 34.7% per year from 2013 to 2019. 4G/long-
term evolution (LTE) technology is in a commanding position to supply this connectivity due to its lower 
operating costs,high data transmission volumes and inherent security compared to other technologies. 
Public Policy
eCall 
eCall is an EC initiative aiming to bring help to motorists 
involved in a collision anywhere in the European Union.  An 
eCall-equipped vehicle can respond to events such as a driver 
signaling for help or an airbag deployment by automatically 
sending a “Minimum Set of Data” including the location of the 
crash, to the nearest emergency centre via the cellular network, 
permitting a rapid and potentially life-saving response by the 
emergency services. An “in-band modem” is used to send data 
over the voice channel, compliant with the 3GPP specification 
TS 26.267: “eCall Data Transfer; In-band modem solution; 
General Description http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/
ecall-time-saved-lives-saved
The European Commission’s ‘Action plan for the deployment 
of intelligent transport systems in Europe’ aims to make road 
transport, and its interfaces with other transport modes, 
more environmentally friendly, more efficient, safer and more 
secure. Deployment of ITS in Europe will be accelerated in a 
coordinated way and European standards, for example for the 
exchange of data, are being set. 
The EU wants to encourage ‘co-modality’ (the efficient use 
of different transport modes together and separately), to cut 
congestion, reduce the number of road traffic accidents, reduce 
energy consumption, cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce 
dependence on fossil fuel. Optimal use of road, traffic and 
travel data;
■■ Continuity of traffic and freight management ITS 
services;
■■ Road safety and security applications;
■■ Linking the vehicle with the transport 
infrastructure.

1  Enabling Technology and  
  Standards in ITS
Cellular radio and smart-phone development are enabling the agile 
and secure expansion of many areas of ITS. 
Cellular networks are constantly evolving, enabling a growing 
range of applications including vehicle communication. The 3rd 
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently study the 
possibility to utilise LTE mobile networks to ensure connectivity 
between vehicles, roadside infrastructure and the people inside 
and around the connected car. 3GPP is currently analyzing 
several use cases (see 3GPP TR 22885), including emergency 
vehicle warning, co-operative adaptive cruise control. The current 
study will be concluded in 3GPP Release 13 and the actual 
standardisation of the features and adaptation needed in LTE will 
take place in 3GPP Release 14. 
There are several benefits that can be identified in using LTE for 
ITS applications:
■■ Fast rollout, deployment of ITS systems by 
leveraging already existing MNO’s infrastructure
■■ Assurance of a global coverage and 
interoperability
■■ Lower cost for car OEMs, one chipset for all 
applications (e.g. infotainment, telematics)
■■ Ability to extend the communication to other 
users, like pedestrians
ETSI are urrently working on common standards for ITS: http://
www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/intelligent-
transport and it is important to note that there are many 
standards relating to ITS in general and to communications in 
ITS in particular – see for example “D3.5b – Standardisation 
Handbook” (Evensen & Schmitting, 2014).
1.1 Cellular radio
Cellular radio in all its incarnations (2G (GSM, GPRS, EDGE), 3G 
(UMTS, HSPA, HSPA+), 4G (LTE) and in the not too distant future 
5G) is an enabler of many new developments in ITS. 
Almost half the world’s population now uses mobile 
communications - 3.4 billion by the end of 2013, and expected to 
pass 4 billion in 2018, with strongest growth in Asia-Pacific. Two 
thirds of subscribers will be on 3G and 4G networks by 2020.
Total connections will grow at 9% -10% p.a. due to strong 
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) connections growth - 1.2 billion 
connected devices by 2017 (GSMA 2013b). Much of this will be in 
the automotive and ITS sectors.  
“Connected car” penetration will increase globally from 11% in 
2012 to 60% in 2017 (and to more than 80% in the United States 
and Western Europe). Mobile technology can revolutionise the 
way we use cars, saving lives, improving the driving experience 
through access to real-time information, allowing remote 
monitoring of performance and location for more effective 
preventative maintenance measures, delivery networks and 
public transport travel information (GSMA 2013b).  Payment 
systems will be facilitated and part or even all of the driving task 
will be automated. 
The GSMA has set up the Automotive Special Interest Group/
Connected Car Forum to enable dialogue between mobile 
operators and vehicle manufacturers. By working together, 
manufacturers and mobile operators can share information, 
resolve barriers to connected car deployment and accelerate 
the adoption of telematics and infotainment services. The ASIG 
has set targets for connectivity solutions to be embedded in 
over 20% of global vehicle sales, and over 50% of cars to be 
connected, by 2015 – as outlined in the Mission Statement;  it 
hopes to have every car multiply connected by 2025 (GSMA 
2013b).  See http://www.gsma.com/connectedliving/events/

1.2 The embedded Universal Integrated Circuit 
Card - eUICC 
A new type of mobile network user will emerge; automobile, 
consumer electronics, energy companies and others will see their 
devices used by millions world-wide. M2M communication will 
become standard, primarily using mobile networks. 
However, there is an issue with the SIM card in these M2M 
applications. One of the benefits of the SIM is that customers can 
easily change the SIM and network operator if they wish. But for 
M2M applications a change of SIM is impractical for a number of 
reasons; it may be inaccessible, or soldered in to prevent fraud 
and damage from vibrations. Operators recognised this and 
developed “GSMA Embedded SIM” technology to allow change 
of operator, subject to any contractual conditions, if required. 
The eUICC is an embedded SIM. The GSMA has produced an 
embedded SIM Specification to accelerate growth in M2M (GSMA 
2014e). The specification provides a standard mechanism for 
remote management of M2M connections, allowing “over the air” 
provisioning of an initial operator subscription, and a change to 
other operators subsequently, while maintaining the same level
