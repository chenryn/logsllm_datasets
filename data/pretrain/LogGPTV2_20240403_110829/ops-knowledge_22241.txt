User: I know you can remove the dock icon for an app by setting LSUIELEMENT = 1. I have an executable created by cx_freeze, which bundles a set of Python scripts into a single executable. How can I remove the dock icon, with or without using AppleScript?
Assistant: Ordinary executables (i.e. command line tools) do not show up in the dock.
