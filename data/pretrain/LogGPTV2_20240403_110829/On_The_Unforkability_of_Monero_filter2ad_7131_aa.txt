## Abstract
Monero, a leading privacy-preserving cryptocurrency by market capitalization, introduced semi-annual hard forks in 2018. Although hard forks are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency industry, the two hard forks in 2018 exposed an anonymity risk due to key reuse, making transactions traceable. This issue arose from the existence of multiple copies of the same coin on different blockchain branches, allowing users to spend the same coins multiple times. We investigate these hard fork events by analyzing transaction data across three different branches of the Monero blockchain. Our findings reveal a small but significant portion of traceable inputs, and we show that the scale of this problem is influenced by external factors such as market price and availability. We propose a cost-effective and easily implementable strategy to prevent key reuse in future strong Monero forks.

## 1. Introduction
Cryptocurrency has become a global phenomenon, with Bitcoin being the first of its kind, launched in January 2009 as a peer-to-peer payment system using a shared ledger called the blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, described it as anonymous, with no information linking public keys to the real identities of their owners. However, the transparency of the blockchain and the development of analysis methods have revealed user behaviors and compromised privacy.

To address these privacy concerns, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies like Monero have been developed. Monero, based on the CryptoNote protocol, uses cryptographic techniques such as Linkable Ring Signatures (LRS) and one-time public keys (OTPK) to enhance anonymity. Despite these measures, research has shown that Monero transactions can still be traced due to zero mixin transactions.

In the context of blockchains, a fork is an event where the protocol changes. Zamyatin et al. [40] classified these changes into protocol expansion, reduction, conflicting (bilateral), and conditionally reduction (velvet). Hard forks, which result in a chain split, and soft forks, which do not, are common in the cryptocurrency industry.

Blockchain forks often benefit users financially. For example, during the Bitcoin Cash fork, users received additional coins, increasing their total value. Monero, aiming to stay updated and ASIC-proof, implemented a regular semi-annual hard fork. The hard fork in April 2018, aimed at improving privacy and rendering existing ASICs ineffective, resulted in the creation of new Monero forks, including Monero Original (XMO), Monero 0 (ZMR), and Monero Classic (XMC).

While these forks doubled the users' Monero coins, they also introduced a key reuse problem, potentially compromising transaction anonymity. We investigate the impact of these hard forks, analyze the traceable inputs, and propose a mitigation strategy.

### Contributions
- **Impact Analysis:** We investigate the impact of two Monero hard forks in 2018, collecting and cross-referencing transaction data to identify over 55K distinct traceable inputs. Approximately 19% of all inputs in Monero version six of our dataset are traceable, though the percentage is insignificant in Monero version seven.
- **Correlation Analysis:** We analyze the correlation between traceable inputs and market prices using statistical methods, finding a strong correlation in Monero6 and a weak correlation in MoneroV. These results suggest that the scalability of the key reuse problem depends on external factors.
- **Mitigation Strategy:** We propose a cost-effective and easily implementable strategy using Scalable Bloom Filters to check for existing key images and mixins, maintaining transaction anonymity. A new service node, the joint node, is proposed to deploy this strategy without significant changes to the current Monero protocol.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Linkable Ring Signature (LRS)
Linkable Ring Signature (LRS) is an extension of the Ring Signature (RS) technique. LRS allows users to maintain anonymity while preventing double-spending. In RS, a signer cannot be identified among a set of potential signers. LRS, however, limits the number of signatures a signer can create with the same private key to maintain anonymity. A tagging system in LRS links signatures created with the same private key, preventing double-spending and double-voting.

### 2.2 Monero Transaction Structure and Protocol
A Monero transaction includes a ring signature R, which uses an output set O of size r. The output set contains the actual output to be spent and r-1 decoys. Decoys are chosen randomly from the public blockchain to make it difficult to guess the real output. Monero transactions can produce zero or more new outputs, which are added to the blockchain and can be used in future transactions.
