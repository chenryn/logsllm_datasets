## Abstract
Cellular networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and overcrowded, leading to significant delays, jitter, and throughput degradation in end-to-end network flows. We propose fine-grained, mobile endpoint-based wireless measurements to inform a precise congestion control algorithm through a well-defined API to the mobile's cellular physical layer. Our proposed congestion control algorithm, PBE-CC (Physical-Layer Bandwidth Estimation at the Endpoint), leverages these measurements to capture the latest 5G New Radio innovations, which increase wireless capacity but also cause abrupt changes in available bandwidth. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the PBE measurement module on software-defined radios and the PBE sender and receiver in C. Extensive performance evaluations show that PBE-CC outperforms existing congestion control protocols, achieving 6.3% higher average throughput than BBR while reducing the 95th percentile delay by 1.8×.

## 1. Introduction
Most modern downlink end-to-end data flows terminate at a cellular last hop, where they experience significant delays, variations in delay, packet loss, and bandwidth limitations. Given the increasing sophistication of cellular networks, this paper argues that mobile endpoints are best positioned to measure the congestion state of an end-to-end connection. The physical layer of the mobile endpoint should measure the congestion state of the wireless last hop and feed these fine-grained measurements to the transport layer and applications through a well-defined API. This approach addresses three key challenges in today's wireless networks:

1. **Shared Medium:** Wireless is a shared medium, so when a user's flow starts or ends, other users in the same cell experience abrupt changes in available capacity, which take time to be reflected in the flow of acknowledgments.
2. **Abrupt Capacity Changes:** Recent advancements in cellular standards, such as LTE-Advanced and 5G New Radio, use carrier aggregation to increase wireless capacity. This can cause abrupt changes in available capacity, which neither the sender nor the cell tower may directly observe.
3. **Dynamic Channel Quality:** Wireless channel quality is highly dynamic due to factors like user mobility, multipath propagation, and interference from neighboring cell towers. These factors change the supported data rate over a timescale known as the wireless channel coherence time, which can be as short as milliseconds.

These factors interact, exacerbating their effects. For example, due to carrier aggregation, an end-to-end connection experiences fluctuations due to the dynamics of all its aggregated cells, typically fewer (two to four) than can offer a smoothing of capacity through statistical multiplexing.

While both the base station and the mobile endpoint can observe these fluctuations, only the latter has fully up-to-date state on the wireless connection to each base station. However, in the current design of the cellular physical layer, mobile users decode only their own channel allocation messages and cannot track other users' channel usage.

This paper introduces PBE-CC, a new congestion control algorithm based on Physical-Layer Bandwidth measurements taken at the mobile endpoint. PBE-CC consists of two modules: an end-to-end congestion control algorithm loosely based on TCP BBR, and a wireless physical-layer capacity measurement module for mobile devices. The key innovation is enabling highly accurate capacity measurements of the wireless cellular link, which track its variations at millisecond-timescale granularity. This allows PBE-CC to rapidly respond to changes in wireless capacity, either increasing or decreasing the sending rate accordingly.

Our evaluation shows that the cellular link is often the bottleneck in the end-to-end path. PBE-CC leverages this assumption to more accurately control the sender's pacing, taking into account the number of users sharing the wireless link to ensure fair distribution of capacity. If PBE-CC detects an increase in one-way delay not anticipated by its capacity forecasts, it triggers a BBR-like mechanism to probe the bottleneck rate.

We have implemented the PBE-CC congestion control module in 814 lines of C++ code. The physical-layer wireless capacity measurement module requires decoding specific frequency bands, which we emulate using USRP software-defined radio in our 3,317-LoC C implementation.

Our performance evaluation uses Pantheon to test PBE-CC against leading congestion control algorithms, including BBR and CUBIC, as well as recent algorithms for cellular networks and other recently proposed algorithms like Copa, PCC, and PCC-Vivace. Experiments include stationary and mobile user-device conditions, both indoors and outdoors, during busy and quiet hours. We also evaluate controlled and uncontrolled competition for wireless network capacity. Table 1 summarizes our performance results: on average, PBE-CC achieves 6.3% higher average throughput than BBR, while reducing the 95th percentile delay by 1.8× and average delay by 1.6×. Against Verus, PBE-CC achieves significant gains in both throughput and delay reduction, and against Copa, PBE-CC achieves an approximate 11× throughput improvement with a 20% latency penalty. We also evaluate multi-user fairness, RTT fairness, and TCP friendliness of PBE-CC.

### End-to-end Congestion Control
Loss-based algorithms [15, 19, 23, 39] achieve high throughput but often introduce excessive delay, while delay-based algorithms [6, 8, 41] are prone to ACK delay, ACK compression, or network jitter, leading to under-utilization of network capacity. These methods also perform poorly when competing with concurrent loss-based algorithms [6, 39]. Other proposals use learned algorithms to optimize specific objective functions, generating better congestion control actions than human-crafted rules [5, 11, 12, 38, 42]. Online learning often converges to solutions that result in significant network under-utilization. BBR [10] targets convergence to Kleinrock’s optimal operating point, simultaneously maximizing throughput and minimizing delay based on estimates of bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propagation time. BBR performs the best among the algorithms we tested but still under-utilizes the network and introduces excessive delay due to coarse-grained capacity estimates.

### End-to-end Congestion Control for Cellular Networks
Some prior work treats the cellular link as a black box and infers link capacity using throughput, packet delay, and loss statistics [21]. Raven [29] reduces interactive video latency by sending redundant data over multiple paths (Wi-Fi and cellular) using Multipath TCP [44]. PROTEUS [47] collects current throughput, loss, and delay statistics to adaptively adjust the sending rate.
