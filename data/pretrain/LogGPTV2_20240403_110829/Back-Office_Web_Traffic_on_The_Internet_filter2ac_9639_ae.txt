trates that a signiﬁcant part of the back-ofﬁce trafﬁc is not trig-
gered by end users. We see that besides the expected players such
as CDNs, search-engines and advertisement companies, cloud ser-
vice providers and Web hosting providers are also responsible for
a large fraction of back-ofﬁce Web trafﬁc.
Indeed, they play an
important role since they provide the resources necessary to build
back-ofﬁce infrastructure. Thus, back-ofﬁce trafﬁc is present in
multiple links on the AS-level, revealing a complex ecosystem of
players in support of the Web.
7. BACK-OFFICE: CHARACTERISTICS
Next, we examine some of the temporal and spatial characteris-
tics of the different types of back-ofﬁce Web trafﬁc. In this section,
we focus exclusively on back-ofﬁce trafﬁc caused by hosts that we
manually identiﬁed to be CDPs, crawlers, auctioneers, or bidders.
7.1 Temporal behavior
To illustrate the temporal characteristics of some of the key play-
ers in the Web back-ofﬁce, Figure 6 provides a time series plot of
the number of requests seen at L-IXP and issued by content deliv-
ery proxies (CDPs), auctioneers, and crawlers, where we normalize
the number of issued requests by the average number of crawler re-
quests.
On the one hand, crawlers display rather constant activity through-
out the week, which is the reason we use them for normalization.
This constancy is to be expected because the request activity is not
triggered by humans. The request patterns of the CDPs and auc-
tioneers, on the other hand, display a diurnal pattern due to their
connection to end-user activity. Interestingly, the rate of decrease
between peak and off hours is larger for the auctioneers than for
the CDPs. A possible explanation for the larger decrease is that the
bidding process is a multiplicative factor of the end-user activity,
i.e., one page visit triggers an auction involving multiple bidders.
In terms of trafﬁc volume (not shown), both CDPs and auction-
eers exhibit typical diurnal variation while crawlers do not. While
crawlers and CDPs dominate in terms of trafﬁc contribution, auc-
tioneers only contribute a tiny share of trafﬁc. This is expected, as
the bidding process involves numerous, but small, transactions.
7.2 Spatial behavior: Request forwarding
Noticing that many HTTP requests include the Via header, we
next take a closer look at Web request forwarding. There are two
HTTP header ﬁelds that are especially relevant for proxies: Via
and X-Forwarded-For. The former indicates if a request has
been forwarded through a proxy or a gateway; multiple Via ﬁeld

values represent each host that forwarded the HTTP request. The
X-Forwarded-For ﬁeld contains the IP address of the original
client, followed by the IP addresses of the proxies on the path to the
server. Thus, if present and correctly set, this header includes the
original client IP as well as all proxy IPs that forwarded the request.
This allows us to elucidate the complexity of the back-ofﬁce by
showing how far requests are forwarded and via how many Web
proxies.
Inspecting these headers requires the ability to inspect the com-
plete payload of a packet. We have full payloads for the BBone-1
and BBone-2 traces, and we extract from them the requests accord-
ing to the previous IPs-CDN+IPs-DPI+Manual classiﬁcation. Re-
call that a signiﬁcant fraction of the requests in these traces are
issued by IPs in IPs-CDN. Thus, the following analysis may be bi-
ased by the behavior of this particular CDN.
The Via header ﬁeld indicates that while 12% of the requests
traversed one proxy, another 77% traversed two proxies. We even
observed a few requests that traversed seven proxies. With the
X-Forwarded-For header ﬁeld we now reconstruct the paths
of the requests, i.e., for each request we extract the list of proxy
IPs and append the destination IP at the end. Perhaps surpris-
ingly, we ﬁnd many private IP addresses among the IPs in the
X-Forwarded-For headers, suggesting that either (a) end users
use proxies on their premises and/or (b) proxies are located within
data-center networks, where private IP address space is used. We
argue that the second case dominates as the ﬁrst IP in the list is
typically publicly routable, e.g., belonging to an end user.
Out of the 1M requests we consider, we ﬁnd 766K different
client IPs appearing in the ﬁrst position of the reconstructed paths.

Figure 7: IP characteristics: Content delivery proxies (CDPs), crawlers (CRA), auctioneers (AUC), and bidders (BID) — L-IXP.
These IPs map to 7.9K different ASes, and around 94% of these
IPs appear only once. The last IP in a reconstructed path may be
an origin server or another proxy. We observe 5.9K different IPs
appearing in this position, and they map to 350 ASes. Note that an
observed request may be further forwarded. Finally, for the subset
of IPs that do not appear at the beginning or end of a path (i.e., for-
warding proxies), we ﬁnd 16.5K different IPs scattered across 885
ASes. Notably, around 2.7K of the IPs are not publicly routable,
yet they sum up to 40% of the occurrences.
To conclude this section, we take a look at the geographical char-
acteristics of request forwarding. For this exercise we focus on the
subset of requests detected via the IP-CDNs set. We then use vali-
dated information about the geographical coordinates of these CDN
servers and rely on this CDN’s commercial geolocation product to
geolocate end users. We observe the following typical scenario for
CDN activity, as seen from these backbone links: an end user is-
sues a request to a front-end server (at 10 to 1000 km distance),
this front-end contacts a back-ofﬁce server within a CDN cluster (0
km distance). This back-ofﬁce server in turn forwards the request
to another back-ofﬁce server that is still on the same continent (10-
1000 km). Then, this proxy forwards the request to an origin server
or to another back-ofﬁce proxy across the Atlantic.
7.3 Communication patterns
Next, we return to examine the activity of the IPs in the L-
IXP trace. Figure 7(a) shows, for the crawlers, auctioneers, bid-
ders, and CDPs, a box plot of the number of sampled back-ofﬁce
HTTP/HTTPS requests we observed. Note that we only analyze
back-ofﬁce trafﬁc characteristics here, and do not, for example,
consider any requests related to the front-ofﬁce activity of CDPs.
We separate sent and received requests on the left and right sides of
the plot. Accordingly, Figure 7(b) shows the observed fan-out (i.e.,
to how many different hosts were requests sent) and fan-in (i.e.,
from how many hosts were requests received). Figure 7(c) shows
the number of sampled bytes received/sent.
Auctioneers and bidders: Auctioneers are the most active in
terms of number of requests sent. From our sampled data we esti-
mate that the average number of bid requests/hour issued by these
IPs is roughly 232 million. This estimate implies that an average
auctioneer IP issues more than 700K bid requests/hour. Overall,
auctioneers also contribute signiﬁcant numbers of bytes in both di-
rections. Indeed, as Figure 7(c) shows, the number of bytes sent
and received are of the same order of magnitude. This balance is
reasonable given the underlying bidding protocol (e.g., [1]). Note,
that the auctioneers only contact a limited set of servers, as high-
lighted in Figure 7(b). Correspondingly, the bidders are also con-
tacted only by a limited set of auctioneers. However, in terms of re-
ceived requests, not all bidder IPs are equally active – some of them
receive just a few bidding requests while others see more than 450K
sampled requests. Indeed, many bidders receive requests from dif-
ferent organizations simultaneously. Given the sampling ratio of
this vantage point, we estimate that the most active bidders receive
more than 42 million requests for bids per hour!
Crawlers: Crawler IPs are the second most active group of IPs
