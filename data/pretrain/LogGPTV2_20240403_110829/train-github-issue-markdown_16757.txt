im using glide:3.7.0.  
i want to create one folder of cache up to 150mb for specific purpose,and
other folder will be for general purposes. ( prefer not to download files to
storage on my own unless i have to)  
what i actually want to achieve is that specific images must be available
offline and their size should not be more than 150 mb.  
thanks.
