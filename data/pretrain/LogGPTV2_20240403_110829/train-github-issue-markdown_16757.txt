I am currently using Glide version 3.7.0. My goal is to create two separate cache folders: one dedicated for a specific purpose with a size limit of 150 MB, and another for general use. I prefer not to handle file downloads and storage manually unless absolutely necessary.

Specifically, I want to ensure that certain images are available offline, but the total size of these images should not exceed 150 MB.

Thank you.
