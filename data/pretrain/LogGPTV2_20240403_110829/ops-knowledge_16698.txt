User: What is container technology? How to use Docker for containerized deployment?
Assistant: Container technology is a virtualization technology that can package applications and their dependencies into a portable container so that applications can run consistently in different environments. Docker is an open source project that provides a container-based virtualization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a single image, and then deploy this image to different hosts. The following are the steps for containerized deployment using Docker: 1. Install Docker Engine and start the daemon process 2. Write a Dockerfile to define the content and construction method of the image 3. Use the Docker command to build a container image 4. Run the container image using docker run Command to start the container 5. Expose the application to the external network, use the docker port and docker network commands to configure the network 6. Install the required applications and services in the container, use the docker exec command to enter the container and execute the command in the container using Docker When deploying, you need to pay attention to the following points: 1. Choose an appropriate basic image and minimize the size of the image. 2. Upload the image to a mirror warehouse such as Docker Hub, which can be easily deployed on different hosts. 3. Configure the container network. Consider security and performance issues 4. The image and its dependencies need to be regularly maintained and updated.
