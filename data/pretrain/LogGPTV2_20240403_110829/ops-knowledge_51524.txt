To run a Jupyter Notebook on your Ubuntu VM, which you have set up using Vagrant, and to access it from your host machine (Windows), you need to bind the Jupyter server to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

### Step 1: Generate Jupyter Configuration File
First, generate the Jupyter configuration file by running the following command in your VM:

```bash
jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

This will create a configuration file named `jupyter_notebook_config.py` in the `.jupyter` directory within your home directory.

### Step 2: Edit the Configuration File
Next, open the `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file in a text editor and modify the following lines:

```python
c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
c.NotebookApp.port = 8004  # You can change the port if needed
```

These settings will:
- Bind the Jupyter server to `0.0.0.0`, making it accessible from any network interface.
- Prevent the browser from opening automatically.
- Set the port to `8004` (or another port if you prefer).

### Step 3: Start Jupyter Notebook
Now, start the Jupyter Notebook server with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 4: Access Jupyter Notebook from Host Machine
To access the Jupyter Notebook from your Windows host machine, you need to know the IP address of your VM. You can find this IP address by running the following command in your VM:

```bash
ifconfig
```

Look for the IP address associated with the network interface that is connected to your host machine. It might be something like `192.168.33.10`.

Once you have the IP address, open a web browser on your Windows host machine and navigate to:

```
http://<VM_IP_ADDRESS>:8004
```

For example, if your VM's IP address is `192.168.33.10`, you would go to:

```
http://192.168.33.10:8004
```

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that the firewall on your VM allows incoming connections on the specified port (e.g., `8004`).
- If you are using Vagrant, you can also configure port forwarding in your `Vagrantfile` to map a port on your host machine to the Jupyter port on your VM. For example:

```ruby
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8004, host: 8004
```

After adding this line to your `Vagrantfile`, you can access the Jupyter Notebook at `http://localhost:8004` on your host machine.

By following these steps, you should be able to run and access your Jupyter Notebook from your Windows host machine.
