User: I want to run jupyter notebook running on my ubuntu vm which i fired using vagrant. 

$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8004
[I 18:26:10.152 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/vagrant/path/to/jupyter/notebook/directory
[I 18:26:10.153 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 18:26:10.154 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8004/
[I 18:26:10.154 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

Jupyter notebook starts in localhost. But to access the notebook from my host machine I need to start the notebook in 0.0.0.0. How to bind the ip 0.0.0.0 so that it routes to 127.0.0.1 in the vm?
My host machine is windows and vm is ubuntu 14.04.4
Assistant: Looks like that in newer versions of Jupyter the changes that should be done in the configuration is a little different from the above answers (otherwise you can get error "'' does not appear to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address").
The entire solution:
Run:

jupyter notebook --generate-config

Change in the config the bellow:

c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False

Now you can run Jupyter simply:

jupyter notebook
