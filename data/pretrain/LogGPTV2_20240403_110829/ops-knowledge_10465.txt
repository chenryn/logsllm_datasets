User: We are running multiple Docker containers on a virtual machine, how to achieve network communication between them?
Assistant: When running multiple Docker containers on a virtual machine, you can use Docker networking to implement network communication between them. Docker networks can be divided into three types: bridge networks, host networks, and custom networks. Bridge networking is the most commonly used type of network, and it allows containers to communicate with the host and with other containers. Docker will automatically assign an IP address to each container and connect them to the same network segment. In this network mode, you can use the name of the container to access, or you can use the IP address of the container. The host network means that the container and the host share the same network namespace, and can directly use the host's IP address to communicate. This network mode is not recommended for production environments because of poor isolation between containers. A custom network is a network mode of a custom network namespace, which can be created through the Docker network creator. It can assign static IP addresses to containers and allow containers to communicate with each other. Custom networks provide better container isolation and security than bridged networks. In practical applications, different network types can be selected according to different requirements to realize network communication between Docker containers.
