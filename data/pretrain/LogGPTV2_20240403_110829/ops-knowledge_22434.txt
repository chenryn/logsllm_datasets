User: I am getting the following error when I launched my build script from   jenkins
os.rename(str1,str)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
I am able to rename the file manually.I have rwx permissions on that file.But I could not do the same thing when python script launched from jenkins.Any ideas ?
Assistant: I think you're using relative path names. In that case it will default to the current working directory, which works when you run it manually, but may fail when Jenkins runs your code using a different working directory. The solution is to make sure that both the src and dst args to os.rename() are absolute paths, or alternatively to chdir() to the correct directory first.
