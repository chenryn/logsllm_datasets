Hello everyone,
I am having a problem with joblib.load("filename.pkl") returning the error:  
ValueError: "Did not recognize loaded array layout"
I've looked for information on this error but have found non. Could someone
assist?
Further information  
I've installed sklearn through pythonxy, on a windows 7 machine, version 15.2
of sklearn. I've trained a large over a large amount of data, about 30
thousand samples, using the random forest classifier. I dump my classifier
using joblib.dump then try to reloaded it using joblib and receive the error
message above.
I've tried the same code on my mac(this was not through pythonxy) and do not
receive an error. I then uninstalled my pythonxy to install the newest version
but I receive the same error.
Full error:
