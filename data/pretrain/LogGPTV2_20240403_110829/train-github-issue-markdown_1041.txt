Hello everyone,

I am encountering an issue with `joblib.load("filename.pkl")` that returns the following error:
```
ValueError: "Did not recognize loaded array layout"
```

Despite searching for information on this error, I have not found any relevant solutions. Could someone please assist me?

### Additional Information
- **Environment:**
  - Operating System: Windows 7
  - Python Distribution: PythonXY
  - scikit-learn Version: 15.2
  - Python Version: 2.7

- **Problem Description:**
  - I trained a Random Forest classifier on a large dataset consisting of approximately 30,000 samples.
  - The model was saved using `joblib.dump`.
  - When attempting to load the model using `joblib.load`, I encounter the above-mentioned error.

- **Reproduction:**
  - The same code runs without errors on my Mac (not using PythonXY).
  - I uninstalled and reinstalled the latest version of PythonXY, but the error persists.

### Full Error Traceback
