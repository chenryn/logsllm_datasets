Question: "A system administrator is configuring a Windows Server that acts as a domain controller. They aim to improve security by mitigating the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks on LDAP traffic. Which policy setting should the administrator enforce to ensure LDAP clients must negotiate data signing, while also considering the potential impact on clients that do not support LDAP signing?"
 "A": "Set the Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements policy to None, as it supports data signing requests from clients."
 "B": "Set the Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements policy to Require signature, to enforce LDAP data-signing negotiation."
 "C": "Set the Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements policy to Not defined, to allow the system to use default settings for flexibility."
 "D": "Implement IPsec Authentication Header mode without changing the LDAP server signing requirements, as it alone sufficiently counters man-in-the-middle attacks."
Answer: B
