### Title: Measuring the Speed of the Red Queen's Race: Adaptation and Evasion in Malware

**Abstract:**

The field of cybersecurity is a perpetual cat-and-mouse game, with security practitioners striving to detect novel malware while attackers continuously adapt to evade detection. The integration of machine learning (ML) techniques into this dynamic landscape has opened up new avenues for analysis. One intriguing question that arises is: how rapidly do malware authors update their code in response to the evolving defenses deployed by security professionals?

In this study, we leverage ML models, which are well-known for their effectiveness in detecting malware, to introduce a novel method for measuring "concept drift" in malware samples over time. Concept drift refers to the changes in the underlying patterns of data, such as the retirement of old campaigns, the introduction of new ones, and the modification of existing campaigns. By employing both simple distance-based metrics and Fisher Information measures, we analyze the evolution of the threat landscape.

Our findings reveal some unexpected trends in the way malware evolves. To complement this research, we will release our PyTorch-based tools, enabling attendees to explore concept drift within their own datasets. This work not only provides insights into the speed and nature of malware adaptation but also equips the cybersecurity community with practical tools to stay ahead in the ongoing arms race.
