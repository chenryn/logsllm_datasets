## Abstract
In this work, we introduce Shoofly (S), a network design tool that minimizes the hardware costs of provisioning long-haul capacity by optically bypassing unnecessary and uneconomical network hops. Leveraging optical signal quality and traffic demand telemetry from a large commercial cloud provider, S identifies optical bypasses in the cloud WAN, reducing the hardware cost of long-haul capacity by 40%. A key challenge is that optical bypasses can increase the distance signals travel before regeneration, potentially reducing link capacities and resilience to failures. Despite these challenges, S provisions topologies that can meet 8X the current demands using existing network hardware, saving 32% of the cost of long-haul capacity while maintaining resilience to both stochastic and deterministic link failure scenarios.

## 1 Introduction
Traffic demands on cloud wide area networks (WANs) are growing rapidly, driven by new workloads such as real-time video and cloud gaming. Cloud providers respond to increased traffic demands by provisioning additional WAN capacity. However, long-haul network capacity is expensive; the median annual cost of 100 Gbps of long-haul capacity in North America exceeds $100,000, according to TeleGeography [32]. Fiber, routers, and equipment in the optical line system (OLS) [19] are the primary contributors to the cost of capacity in the cloud WAN (Figure 1).

Large cloud providers have existing fiber deployments, acquired through purchase or long-term leases. Thus, the marginal cost of provisioning capacity in the cloud is dominated by the additional hardware resources used, such as router and optical ports.

Cloud providers operate point-to-point inter-regional networks, where optical signals are converted to electrical signals and back at every geographical region [12]. This means that inter-regional traffic undergoes optical-to-electrical-to-optical (OEO) conversion at all intermediate regions on its path. For example, in Figure 3, wavelength _1 originates at US-East, terminates at US-West, but undergoes an OEO conversion at US-Central. Once the signals are converted from the optical to the electrical domain, centralized traffic engineering systems take control of routing them [18, 20].

This design provides control and flexibility at the network layer, keeping the optical layer simple and easy to manage. However, it does not consider the nature of traffic demands and the corresponding traffic flow imposed by them. Our analysis of inter-regional traffic patterns in the backbone of a large commercial cloud provider shows that 60% of traffic traversing 30% of geographical regions in the WAN is passing through, neither originating nor terminating at the region. This pass-through or transit traffic undergoes wasteful OEO conversions at all intermediate regions, occupying scarce optical line and router ports, which contribute significantly to the cost of provisioning capacity in cloud networks with existing fiber deployments (Figure 2).

## 2 Quantifying the Opportunity
Cloud providers lease or purchase optical fiber across the world to provision their WAN. This fiber is connected to optical equipment, including optical terminals and amplifiers, to transmit optical signals over hundreds of kilometers. Signals can originate, terminate, or pass through an optical terminal. Terminating signals undergo a conversion from the optical to the electrical domain, and the corresponding electrical signals are de-multiplexed onto router or switch ports. Conversely, electrical signals from router ports are converted to optical signals and multiplexed onto wavelengths of light that traverse the fiber. Pass-through signals do not originate or terminate at an optical terminal and are said to optically bypass a router (e.g., US-Central is bypassed by wavelength _2 in Figure 3).

### 2.1 Point-to-Point Regional Backbones
The commercial cloud provider we studied has provisioned their wide-area backbone in a point-to-point regional topology. In this design, optical signals undergo regeneration at all regional hops. This design offers two main benefits:
1. **Fine-grained control via Layer-3 traffic engineering:** Optical signals are converted to the electrical domain at all regional hops, allowing Layer-3 traffic engineering algorithms to make hop-by-hop decisions based on fine-grained, cross-layer telemetry.
2. **Flexibility to meet new demands:** Wavelengths undergo conversion to electrical signals at every region, allowing traffic from one region to be IP-routed to any other region without changes to the optical backbone.

Despite these benefits, we propose rethinking this design in the context of traffic flow patterns. Our analysis shows that the nature of inter-regional traffic flow enables significant potential for cost savings in point-to-point backbones.

### 2.2 Wasteful OEO Conversions
We study the traffic flow between geographical regions of a large commercial cloud provider. The cloud provider has data centers in approximately 100 geographical regions, connected by a dedicated optical backbone. Demands between regions are routed through a centralized software-defined traffic engineering (TE) controller [18, 20]. The TE controller solves a k-shortest path formulation of the multi-commodity flow problem [1]. We measure hourly demands between regions and the corresponding paths over which they are routed from August 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.

All traffic transits at least one geographical region. For each demand source and destination pair, we measure the fraction of traffic that passes through intermediate regions. Our analysis shows that 60% of traffic traversing 30% of geographical regions in the WAN is pass-through traffic, undergoing wasteful OEO conversions at all intermediate regions.

## 3 Optical Bypass with Shoofly
We leverage insights from inter-regional traffic patterns to enable optical bypass in the network, aiming to reduce the cost of long-haul capacity by preventing wasteful OEO conversions while using existing network hardware and software.

### 3.1 Physical Constraints on Optical Bypass
Optical bypass forces signals to travel longer distances on fiber before they can be regenerated, leading to more attenuation and lower optical signal quality. Signal quality, measured by optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), determines the data rate of the optical signal. State-of-the-art optical transponders support three data rates per wavelength: 200 Gbps, 150 Gbps, and 100 Gbps, using 16-QAM, 8-QAM, and QPSK modulation formats, respectively. Thus, optical bypass can lower the achievable data rates due to increased transmission distance.

Table 1 shows the relationship between modulation formats, their OSNR thresholds, and data rates.

## 4 Key Contributions
- **Optimal Optical Bypass in Cloud WANs:** We develop Shoofly, an optical backbone design tool that identifies optical bypass opportunities to minimize the hardware costs of long-haul capacity. Shoofly-proposed topologies can reduce the hardware cost of long-haul capacity by 40% while meeting up to 8X the current demands using existing hardware and fiber deployments.
- **Failure Resilience with Optical Bypass:** We extend Shoofly to incorporate failure resilience while identifying bypass opportunities. Shoofly can provision topologies resilient to both stochastic and deterministic link failures, sacrificing at most 20% of hardware cost savings.
- **Low Logistical Burden of Enabling Optical Bypass:** We quantify the logistical burden of provisioning Shoofly-proposed bypasses. The bypass-enabled topology can keep up with demand growth, up to 8X the current demands. Implementing bypasses requires modifications to physical connections, but a small number of changes achieve 80% of the cost savings.

## 5 Conclusion
The design of optical networks has been well-studied by service and content providers. Cloud WANs with centralized software-defined traffic engineering present a unique opportunity to rethink conventional backbone designs due to the predictability of intra-WAN traffic. This work does not raise any ethical issues.
