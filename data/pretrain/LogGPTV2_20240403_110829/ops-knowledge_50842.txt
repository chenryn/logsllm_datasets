User: Please explain what "containerization" technology is, and explain its difference and connection with virtualization.
Assistant: Containerization technology is a technology for application development and deployment that packages the application and all its dependencies into a container so that the application can run across platforms without being affected by the underlying environment. Specifically, containerization technology can package an application's code, libraries, configuration files, and other dependencies together to form a portable environment, ready to be deployed to a different computer or cloud platform. The difference between containerization technology and virtualization method is that virtualization method simulates hardware to create a complete virtual operating system, and then runs applications in it. The containerization technology uses the kernel of the host operating system to realize the isolation and resource management of the application program by isolating the application process. Relatively speaking, containerization technology is faster, starts faster, and consumes fewer resources. The connection between containerization technology and virtualization approach is that both can achieve application isolation and resource management. However, their implementation methods and application scenarios are different. Virtualization is mainly used for infrastructure such as virtualized servers, while containerization technology is more suitable for application development, testing, deployment, and operation and maintenance. At the same time, containerization technology can also be combined with virtualization to run containerized applications on virtualized infrastructure to further improve resource utilization and flexibility.
