User: My machine is OsX 10.10.2 and I have Python 2 installed.
It is possible to create a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper command mkvirtualenv to run on Python 3?
I am reluctant to install Python3 in my system as the last time I did that, python on the whole stopped working. Not sure why, I am a new. May I screwed up. I am looking for the command to run.
Assistant: You can use the -p arg like so -- virtualenv -p $(which python3)
