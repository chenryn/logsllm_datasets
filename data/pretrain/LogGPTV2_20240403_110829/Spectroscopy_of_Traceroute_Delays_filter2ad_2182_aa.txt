## Abstract
This study analyzes the delays of traceroute probes, which are packets that elicit ICMP TimeExceeded messages, for a full range of probe sizes up to 9000 bytes as observed on unloaded high-end routers. Our primary motivation is to use traceroute Round-Trip Times (RTTs) for Internet mapping at the router and Point-of-Presence (PoP) level, including the potential extraction of information on equipment models, link technologies, capacities, latencies, and spatial positions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the detailed statistics of ICMP response generation in a reliable testbed setting.

We find that two fundamental assumptions about ICMP often do not hold in modern routers: that ICMP delays are a linear function of packet size and that the ICMP generation rate equals the capacity of the interface on which probes are received. The primary causes of these violations appear to be optimizations that suppress size dependence, such as buffer carving, and rate-limiting of internal ICMP packet and bit rates. Our results suggest that the linear model of packet delay as a function of packet size merits revisiting, especially for packets over 1500 bytes. Our findings also suggest possibilities for developing new techniques for bandwidth estimation and router fingerprinting.

## 1. Introduction
Remote network mapping typically relies on active measurement. A measurement host sends packets that trigger ICMP replies from routers, and the reply information is integrated into a map. Commonly elicited ICMP responses include Time Exceeded, Echo Reply, and Port Unreachable.

An ICMP reply carries binary ("host is alive"), discrete ("9 hops away"), and temporal ("replied in 15 ms") data. The per-hop delay (in the form of RTT) is potentially the richest source of information about a router. However, extracting useful components from a delay value is challenging, as the delay summands, their statistics, and their dependencies on other factors are often unknown.

In the common linear model, packet delay is split into three summands, with one being proportional to packet size. Specifically, the delay \( d \) is modeled as:
\[ d = ax + b + \xi \]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive real constants, \( x \) is the size of the packet or frame, and \( \xi \) is a positive random variable ("residual delay") that can be arbitrarily close to 0. This representation implies that \( d = ax + b \) is a tight lower bound for all observed delays. Most network spectroscopy and bandwidth estimation experts assume that delay is a linear function of packet size.

Our main goal in this study is to test the validity of this linear model, at least with respect to delays seen in ICMP responses. Our underlying motivation is to find ways of using traceroute RTTs to:
- Construct router and PoP-level Internet maps
- Obtain metric maps with link latencies and capacities
- Enable user-level path diagnosis
- Improve the integrity of variable-size bitrate estimation tools
- Fingerprint routers

For example, one approach to identifying a PoP would be to look at traceroute paths that branch between backbone and access routers. Given that routing to external destinations is common among all routers within a PoP, return paths to the monitor will be the same. One could thus use the topological closeness of forward paths together with the numeric closeness of RTTs to identify interfaces that belong to the same PoP. This aggregation technique requires precise knowledge of typical latencies across a PoP, as well as how often and for how long ICMP TimeExceeded generation can be delayed.

A typical traceroute covers 14-20 hops, and during a traceroute, all but the last hop responds with an ICMP TimeExceeded packet. The last hop responds with an ICMP EchoReply or ICMP PortUnreachable. We will discuss properties of delays obtained from TimeExceeded packets in detail. Future work will focus on destination-based (EchoReply, PortUnreachable) ICMP delays.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews previous work, Section 3 describes our testbed and experiment design, Section 4 presents our results, and Section 5 contains discussion and conclusions.

## 2. Previous Work
Although the need for precise and detailed measurement of packet delays is recognized by the networking community, equipment constraints make it challenging, and the literature on this topic is limited. Few researchers have access to high-precision (sub-microsecond precision) capture cards or high-performance routers representative of those deployed in Tier-1 ISP backbones.

Most previous work does not focus on ICMP delays but rather on separating forwarding (router transit) delays from queueing delays or delays caused by network distance. For example, Bovy et al. estimated the forwarding delay of three office-class routers to be 224 µs per 100-byte packet per hop. A wide variety of work in bandwidth estimation, much of it surveyed in [11] and [12], also assumes that delays are amenable to linear modeling.

Researchers from Sprint’s Advanced Technology Laboratory (ATL) conducted several studies of instrumented operational routers in a setup similar to ours, supporting the claim that queueing delay in a well-provisioned network is small enough to effectively allow VOIP deployment. A Light Reading test of Cisco, Juniper, and Foundry measured forwarding delays at line rate (100% load).

Govindan and Paxson, and Anagnostakis et al. also studied ICMP generation times, concluding that ICMP-based RTTs do not tend to include excessive (slow path) delays. Timing jitter in the network around routers complicates the attribution of these delays, but their values (0.1–0.3 ms) are comparable to those in [10] and to ours.

The goal of [18] is to infer link latencies and queueing from ICMP timestamp differences at both ends of a link. The authors found routers (5 out of 20 studied) with 95th percentiles of ICMP Timestamp delay around 10 ms; 2 had 95th percentiles at 80 ms. Remote link estimation is quite daunting in the face of such high uncertainty. For comparison, more than 99.6% of our TimeExceeded delays up to 9000 bytes are under 1 ms, except a few (0.4%) that are rate-limited by Juniper routers to incur approximately 10 ms delays.

Donnelly and Mochalski et al. demonstrated a piecewise linear size dependence for router/switch transit times, showing a noticeable rate change at 512 bytes. This phenomenon is similar to our ICMP delay rate discontinuities occurring around 1500 bytes.

To the best of our knowledge, precision timestamping matching modern router speeds is available only with Dag cards from the Waikato group and Endace. The latest models (4.xx) can reach sub-microsecond accuracy when synchronized to GPS or CDMA. Some of the available studies use the older model (3.xx) of Dag cards, with 5–6 µs precision and 53-byte uncertainty. Despite these limitations, the results obtained in [9], [13], and [14] have served as inspiration for this work.

## 3. Data Collection
We collected our measurements in CAIDA’s high-speed testbed, which includes:
- Two IBM eServers (running FreeBSD 4.8)
- A Dell Gigabit Ethernet switch
- Juniper, Cisco, and Foundry routers
- An OC48 link between the Juniper and Cisco
- Gigabit Ethernet links between all other devices

The testbed’s path MTU is 9000 bytes. We tap both links at the Cisco router (OC48 and gigE) using NetOptics splitters and capture packets with Dag cards. The Foundry router doubles as a 16-port switch that connects all equipment in the lab to the Internet and to CAIDA’s production network via 100 M Ethernet.

We perform traceroutes on herald or post, and use CoralReef utilities to capture, process, and extract delays from packets. A command line on herald of:
```bash
traceroute -q 4 -M 2 -m 3 -w 2 -P udp -t 64 post 214
```
specifies a series of 4 probes to hops 2 through 3, using a timeout of 2 seconds, UDP, TOS of 64, and packet size of 214 bytes. Its output looks like (numbers from real data):
```
2 cisco-oc48 0.221 ms 0.154 ms 0.254 ms 0.168 ms
3 foundry 0.217 ms 0.226 ms 0.230 ms 0.227 ms
```

Our experiments combine UDP and ICMP traceroutes with 9 TOS values (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128) and sizes 64-9000 bytes, for a total of 160866 (2*9*8937) traceroutes, each probing 2 hops with 4 packets at each hop. The router configuration ensures that the return path for an ICMP packet is symmetric with the forward path.

Traceroute dynamics determine the intervals between probes in our experiments. We call the time lag between two successive packets targeting the same interface an interprobe gap (IPG). When traceroute probes one hop, it sends the next packet immediately after receiving an ICMP TimeExceeded for the previous packet. These probes succeed each other within a few hundred microseconds (under 1 ms). The next traceroute command will probe the same hop after an OS scheduling quantum (10 ms) and after probing a subsequent hop (several milliseconds); in that case, the probes are separated by 10-20 ms. When a TimeExceeded is not generated or is lost before the source host receives it (the loss is very rare in our experiments), the traceroute script waits for a 2-second timeout. This gap can affect the delay of the packet that follows, e.g., through route cache latency if the address has been flushed from the cache.

**Parameter Scan:**
We walk the experiment design space (NS packet sizes, NP protocols, ND destinations, NT TOSes, etc.) using a pseudo-random scan. Scanning of other parameters (hop number, packets/hop) is part of typical traceroute operation. We take the product of dimensions \( m = NS \times NP \times ND \times NT \ldots \) and find a prime \( p > m \). Then we find a primitive root \( r \mod p \) near \( \sqrt{p} \), and try all combinations of parameter values as follows. For experiment \( k \), \( 1 \leq k \leq m \), we use \( a_k = r^k \mod p \) in mixed-radix notation to get indices S (index for size), P (index for protocol), D (index for destination):
\[ S = a_k \mod NS, \quad P = \left\lfloor \frac{a_k}{NS} \right\rfloor \mod NP, \quad D = \left\lfloor \frac{a_k}{(NS \times NP)} \right\rfloor \mod ND, \ldots \]

**Example:**
For two packet sizes (NS = 2) and two protocols (NP = 2), \( m = NS \times NP = 4 \) and \( p = 5 \); \( r = 3 \) is a possible choice of a primitive root. Combinations of packet size (e.g., (40, 1500) indexed by (0,1)) and protocol ((UDP, ICMP) indexed by (0,1)) follow each other in sequence:
\[ (3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4) \mod 5 = (3, 4, 2, 1) = (11, 00, 10, 01)_2, \]
where 11 corresponds to (ICMP, 1500), and so on.

This approach, inspired by turbo codes and Monte-Carlo integration techniques, is robust against outages, whether at the beginning (Dag cards warming up) or at the end (too small capture interval, disk space). All parameter values appear close to the start of the experiment (as opposed to with a lexicographic scan), which allows us to debug problems with each dimension or value, e.g., too high chance of a timeout.

The longer duration of the second (PCJ) experiment is due to a higher level of ICMP non-generation on Juniper (12140 or 2% of all probes), resulting in more occurrences of the 2-second timeouts. This extra 10K (12140-2310) of timeouts increases the experiment duration by about 5.5 hours. Additionally, Juniper’s generation bitrate of TimeExceeded (at 8 ns/bit) is the slowest of all three routers. ICMP bitrate limiting causes many packets in the 7000-9000 byte range (73K or 11%) to arrive more than 1 ms later than the previous probe. This lag applies to packets 2-4. Packet 1 is always delayed by an OS scheduling quantum of 10 ms, which explains the large number of packets (about 25% of the total) in the 10-100 ms bin. The drop rate (non-generation) for the Foundry is under 0.4%, and the Cisco returns all 643464 probes, i.e., has a 0% drop rate.

## 4. Results
**Table 2: Lower Bound for Size Dependence Parameters**

We provide a lower bound for size dependence parameters from the equation \( d = ax + b \): \( a \) (slope) and \( b \) (intercept) of TimeExceeded delay. We apply the O(N) linear programming (LP) algorithm of [28] to delays observed at the Cisco and Juniper OC48 interfaces for all packet sizes, and to those at the Cisco and Foundry gigE interfaces separately for ranges ≤ 1500 and > 1500. This latter choice is based on the fact that:
