User: I cannot get jupyter running from my Command line using:
jupyter notebook

jupyter is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file'

But I can get it running from pycharm (slick but with issues). When I take the kernel's IP and Port from pycharm and paste it into my browser I can get it running from there. 
I cannot use anaconda because of Arcpy, and I have dug around the jupyter files for some hints.
I'm assuming I need to add something to my path?
Assistant: To add Jupyter as the windows CLI Command.
You need to add the "C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\Scripts" into your environment path. This was to solve for me.
