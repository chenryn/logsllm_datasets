### Detailed Description
When using OpenCV version 4.5.3 to call the `stitch` method on iOS, I encounter an error that prevents me from debugging. The issue appears to be intermittent, and it is particularly common when transmitting iPad screenshots to the stitching function.

The following image shows the error stack:

Here is the relevant code snippet:
```cpp
Ptr<Stitcher> stitcher = Stitcher::create(cv::Stitcher::SCANS);
Stitcher::Status status = stitcher->stitch(imgs, pano);
```

I am unable to determine the root cause of this error. Could you please assist in identifying and resolving this issue?
