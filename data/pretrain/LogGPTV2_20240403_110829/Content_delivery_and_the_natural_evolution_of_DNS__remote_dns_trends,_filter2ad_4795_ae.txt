5.4.2 Performance comparison utility
namehelp also includes a DNS benchmarking tool based
on namebench [18]. To compare DNS services, we adopt
namebench’s approach, which makes queries to both public
and ISP DNS servers for a set of domain names. By default,
a list of popular sites from Alexa.com is used, but users
can use their web browser history to personalize the results.
Using the results of these tests, it ranks DNS servers by mean
response time and shows potential server-speciﬁc issues to
the user (e.g. NXDOMAIN hijacking [31]).
namehelp benchmarking service extends the functionality
of namebench to evaluate CDN performance via diﬀerent

DNS services. Tests can be run against a list of popular
websites, or tailored with a user’s browsing history.
In
addition, the tool also probes DNS services to test for
edns-client-subnet support, given its potential performance
beneﬁts when available (§4.3).
To evaluate end-to-end CDN performance provided by
a DNS service, namehelp benchmarking downloads the se-
lected web pages and their linked objects (i.e. images, scripts
and stylesheets) using the given DNS service to resolve
domain names. We determine end-to-end latency using
the methodology from §3.3. We adopt a single-threaded
architecture for downloading web objects for simplicity.
Although optimizations for downloading web objects (e.g.
parallel connections and HTTP pipelining) could change the
overall time necessary to download a web page, our approach
yields comparable results of end-to-end performance between
public DNS services. Caching of DNS lookups and HTTP
objects when possible minimizes the test’s run time and the
bandwidth consumed.
The results of these tests are presented to the user,
enabling her to make an informed decision regarding which
DNS service to use based not only on DNS performance (as
namebench) but also including the resulting CDN perfor-
mance.
6. RELATED WORK
Our work builds upon and signiﬁcantly extends a number
of past studies on DNS, CDNs and their interaction.
Johnson et al.
CDNs. In an early study by Krishnamurthy et al. [13],
the authors evaluate characterize the beneﬁts of CDNs from
the client perspective.
[10] studied the
redirection performance of CDNs and conclude that they
succeed not by selecting optimal servers, but rather by
avoiding making bad decisions. Wang et al. [33] analyze
methods of maximizing CDN’s objectives of
improving
response time and system throughput under a wide range
of loads. Nygren et al. [19] describe several aspects of the
Akamai’s network, and Triukose et al. [29] studies Akamai’s
performance. WhyHigh [14] is a tool used by Google to iden-
tify and diagnose client performance issues from the CDN’s
perspective. Although a detailed view of a CDN’s network
is a valuable perspective for evaluating a CDN, a persistent
challenge is accurately capturing the end-user’s perceived
performance under the range of alternative settings. In this
work, we capture this end user’s perspective to accurately
characterize the end-to-end performance impact of remote
DNS usage.
DNS and CDNs. DNS is a critical component of
the Internet infrastructure and, since Mockapetris and
Dunlap’s [17] retrospective study, has been the subject of
several measurement analysis (e.g. [1, 11, 15, 16, 22, 25]) and
proposed design alternatives (including [23, 24]). A number
of studies [1, 9, 12, 16, 25] have evaluated diﬀerent aspects
of DNS-based redirections and CDNs. Mao et al.
[16]
determine that this is suﬃcient for coarse-grained (e.g. AS-
level) server selection, but not as precise at the granularity
of BGP preﬁxes. Shaikh et al. [25] ﬁnd the ping time to a
client’s DNS server is a poor predictor of ping time to the
actual client. The recent growth in usage of remote DNS
services, such as OpenDNS [20, 21] and Google DNS [6], has
motivated studies on the implications of remote DNS and
its interactions with CDN redirections.
In a preliminary
study of DNS resolvers by Ager et al. [1], the authors report
534that typically-employed load balancing techniques have a
detrimental eﬀect on the eﬃcacy of DNS caching and that
public DNS-based redirection is less likely to point users
to an available copy of content within their own network.
Huang et al. [9] documented that a user’s nearest public DNS
server is considerably farther away than that user’s ISP-
provided DNS server, and that using a more-distant public
DNS server resulted in redirections to edge servers that were
farther away. Our work builds on and extends these studies
by evaluating the end-to-end performance impact of remote
DNS on CDNs and conducting an extensive diagnosis of the
results.
Several
Solutions. Several approaches have been proposed to
address the poor interaction between remote DNS and CDN
redirections. Khosla et al.
[12] studied the interaction
between “cloud-based” remote DNS and Akamai redirections
and discussed several possible approaches to mitigate the
performance penalty. Huang et al. proposed an application-
level solution to address the mismatch between client and
local DNS resolvers [8].
industry players have
formed the “Global Internet Speedup” [28] collaboration.
This group advocates for the adoption of the proposed
edns-client-subnet DNS extension [3], which passes along
part of a client’s IP address to CDNs to improve DNS-
based server selection decisions. Our work presents the ﬁrst
evaluation of the performance beneﬁts and adoption of this
DNS extension.
In addition, we are the ﬁrst to propose
and evaluate a general client-based solution that allows
unmodiﬁed applications to enjoy the beneﬁts of improved
redirections. We present Direct Resolution, an alternative
end-host approach to the industry proposed DNS extension,
describe namehelp, an implementation of the DR approach
and evaluate its performance beneﬁts.
7. CONCLUSION
We explored the end-to-end impact of using remote
DNS services on CDN performance and presented the ﬁrst
evaluation of an industry-proposed solution to the problem.
We showed that remote DNS usage can indeed signiﬁcantly
impact client’s web performance and that the proposed
solution, if available, can eﬀectively address the problem for
most clients. Considering the performance cost of remote
DNS usage and the limited adoption base of the industry-
proposed solution, we present and evaluate Direct Resolu-
tion, an alternative approach to readily obtain comparable
performance improvements without requiring CDN or DNS
participation. We have implemented our approach as part
of namehelp, a DNS proxy running on the client local host.
namehelp also provides a benchmark service, comparing the
impact of alternative DNS services on CDN performance.
We have made namehelp publicly available. We continue
to monitor the adoption of the edns-client-subnet DNS
extension by DNS services and CDNs. We are also studying
approaches for evaluating the potential performance beneﬁts
of this extension when providing partial client location
information, while investigating alternative heuristics to
improve namehelp’s performance.
