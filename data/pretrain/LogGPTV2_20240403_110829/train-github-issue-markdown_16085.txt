# Bug report
## Describe the bug
If we use `next/dynamic` to import components in several files, we experience
a flashing "loading..." text when the client mounts.
If we only import one place, it works fine.  
It also works fine in development.
## To Reproduce
Codesandbox example below shows that the `One` component flashes with
"loading" text since it is imported twice, while the `Two` component does not
flash, because it is only imported once.

## Expected behavior
I expect the dynamic import to behave the same in development and production,
as well as it not causing a flash when the client mounts.
