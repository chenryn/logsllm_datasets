User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Create non-root user and disable root SSH in Ansible I'm trying to write an Ansible playbook to bootstrap my servers. By default on Linode I can only login as root with a password, so my playbook logs in as root, creates a non-root user with an SSH key, and disables root and password SSH.

This is a problem because I now can't run that playbook again since root login is disabled! I would like the playbook to be idempotent and not have to add and remove hosts after bootstrapping them.

Assistant: I like to do it this way:

- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Check ansible user
      command: ssh -q -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=3 ansible@{{ inventory_hostname }} "echo OK"
      delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false
      register: check_ansible_user
    - block:
      - name: Create Ansible user
        user:
          name: ansible
          comment: "Ansible user"
          password: $6$u3GdHI6FzXL01U9q$LENkJYHcA/NbnXAoJ1jzj.n3a7X6W35rj2TU1kSx4cDtgOEV9S6UboZ4BQ414UDjVvpaQhTt8sXVtkPvOuNt.0
          shell: /bin/bash
      - name: Add authorized key
        authorized_key:
          user: ansible
          key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
          exclusive: yes
      - name: Allow sudo for ansible
        copy:
          content: ansible ALL=(ALL) ALL
          dest: /etc/sudoers.d/ansible
          mode: 0600
      when: check_ansible_user | failed


I try to connect to the remote host with my ansible user. If this is impossible (on the first run), I connect as root and create the ansible user along with its authorized_keys file and sudo rights.

On subsequent runs, connecting as ansible user works, so the block of tasks can be skipped. 

Once the remote host is bootstrapped, I can go on with the ansible user and become:

- hosts: all
  remote_user: ansible
  become: yes
  roles:
    - ...
