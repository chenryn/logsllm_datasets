User: I'm looking at implementing a fuzzy logic controller based on either PyFuzzy (Python) or FFLL (C++) libraries.
I'd prefer to work with python but am unsure if the performance will be acceptable in the embedded environment it will work in (either ARM or embedded x86 proc both ~64Mbs of RAM). 
The main concern is that response times are as fast as possible (an update rate of 5hz+ would be ideal >2Hz is required).  The system would be reading from multiple (probably 5) sensors from an RS232 port and provide 2/3 outputs based on the results of the fuzzy evaluation.
Should I be concerned that Python will be too slow for this task?
Assistant: I never really measured the performance of pyfuzzy's examples, but as the new version 0.1.0 can read FCL files as FFLL does. Just describe your fuzzy system in this format, write some wrappers, and check the performance of both variants.
For reading FCL with pyfuzzy you need the antlr python runtime, but after reading you should be able to pickle the read object, so you don't need the antlr overhead on the target.
