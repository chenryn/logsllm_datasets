I am currently working on an application that I would like to run locally using Google App Engine. However, I'm encountering an issue with importing the `requests` module. The log console is displaying an error message stating, "no such module exists."

To resolve this, I have already installed the `requests` module via pip, both globally and in my project directory. When I attempt to install it again in the project directory, the terminal responds with: 

"Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): requests in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages"

Despite these efforts, Google App Engine still indicates that the `requests` module is not present. I suspect this might be a path-related issue, but I am only able to locate the App Engine launcher on my Mac.

**Solution:**

In order to use the `requests` module (or any other external libraries) in your Google App Engine application, you need to include the `requests` package directly within your project's directory. Specifically, ensure that the `requests` package, including its `__init__.py` file, is located at the following path relative to your script: `./requests/__init__.py`.

This method applies to all third-party modules you wish to incorporate into your Google App Engine application. If the `__init__.py` file is not found directly under the specified location, the module will not function correctly.

Additionally, there is no need to explicitly add the `requests` module to your `app.yaml` configuration file.
