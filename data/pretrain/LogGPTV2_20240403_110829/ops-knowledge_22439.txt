User: I'm trying to import the requests module for my app which I want to view locally on Google App Engine. I am getting a log console error telling me that "no such module exists".
I've installed it in the command line (using pip) and even tried to install it in my project directory. When I do that the shell tells me:

"Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): requests in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages".

App Engine is telling me that the module doesn't exist and the shell says it's already installed it. 
I don't know if this is a path problem. If so, the only App Engine related application I can find in my mac is the launcher?
Assistant: You need to add the requests/requests sub-folder to your project. From your script's location (.), you should see a file at ./requests/__init__.py.
This applies to all modules you include for Google App Engine. If it doesn't have a __init__.py directly under that location, it will not work.
You do not need to add the module to app.yaml.
