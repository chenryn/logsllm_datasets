Question: Select the roles and security measures that are correctly associated with the Secure Enclave and the Secure Neural Engine in Apple devices.
"A": "The Secure Enclave uses a Secure Storage Component to provide anti-replay security for events such as a Passcode change or adding a new Apple Pay card.",
"B": "The Secure Neural Engine on A11 to A13 SoCs is a separate processor with its own monitoring circuits to detect illegal operating points.",
"C": "The Secure Enclave includes power and clock monitors that stop the clocks automatically if an illegal operating point is detected, preventing restart until the next SoC reset.",
"D": "Starting with the A14 and M1 family, the Secure Neural Engine uses a dedicated hardware security controller to switch between tasks, ensuring the isolation of Face ID data."
