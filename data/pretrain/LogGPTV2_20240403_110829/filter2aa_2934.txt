**Abstract:**
WPA2 is widely regarded as the most secure configuration for WiFi networks, used extensively in both enterprise and private settings. It is also employed to secure guest, municipal, and public WiFi networks. This paper identifies a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol that can be exploited by malicious users to attack and compromise legitimate users. We also propose several mitigation techniques to protect genuine WiFi users.

**1. Introduction**
The 802.11i standard [1] specifies security protocols for WiFi networks. One of the security configurations available in 802.11i is Robust Security Network (RSN), commonly known as WPA2. WPA2 supports two types of authentication: Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and IEEE 802.1x. For data encryption, WPA2 primarily uses AES, although it also supports TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol). TKIP is a legacy protocol used by older devices that are compliant with WEP encryption. Most modern WiFi devices support AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

Several vulnerabilities in WPA/WPA2 have been documented:

- **PSK Vulnerability [2]:** PSK is susceptible to eavesdropping and dictionary attacks. To mitigate this, it is recommended to use IEEE 802.1x-based authentication.
- **PEAP Vulnerability [3]:** A configuration-related vulnerability in WiFi clients was identified in 2008. This can be avoided by following best practices and not ignoring certificate validation checks in client wireless configurations.
- **TKIP Vulnerability [4]:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to guess the IP address of the subnet and inject small frames, causing network disruption. Fast re-keying or switching to AES can address this issue.

In the following sections, we describe a new vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol, discuss its implications, and propose solutions to mitigate these attacks.

**2. GTK Vulnerability**
In WPA2, two types of keys are used for data encryption: PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) and GTK (Group Temporal Key). PTK is used to encrypt unicast data traffic, while GTK is used to encrypt group-addressed data traffic. PTK is derived on a per-association basis, whereas GTK is randomly generated by the Access Point (AP) and distributed to all associated clients. GTK is a shared key known to all clients in the network.

**Figure 1: All clients have the same copy of GTK "K1"**

GTK is intended for use as an encryption key by the AP and as a decryption key by the clients. However, a malicious client can alter its behavior to use GTK to encrypt and send group-addressed data frames to all associated clients. By doing so, the malicious client can inject any type of packet, enabling various attacks in a WLAN, such as ARP cache poisoning.

**Possible Attacks:**

- **Attack 1: Stealth ARP Cache Poisoning/Spoofing Attack**
  - **Step 1:** The attacker injects a fake ARP packet to poison the client's cache for the gateway.
  - **Step 2:** The victim's ARP cache is poisoned, leading the victim to send all traffic to the attacker's machine.
  - **Step 3:** The attacker can either drop the traffic or forward it to the actual gateway, potentially launching a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

**Figure 2: Stealth ARP Poisoning**

**Difference between Normal and Stealth Mode ARP Poisoning:**
- **Normal ARP Poisoning [9]:** Injected frames may appear on the wire via the AP, making detection by wired monitoring tools highly likely.
- **Stealth Mode ARP Poisoning:** Injected frames are invisible to the AP and do not go on the wire, making them undetectable by network-based ARP cache monitoring tools.

- **Attack 2: IP Layer Targeted Attack**
  - The attacker encapsulates an IP packet in a group-addressed data frame. Only the client whose IP address matches the destination IP in the packet will accept it, while others will reject it. This technique can be used to launch various TCP and application layer attacks, such as TCP reset, DNS manipulation, port scanning, malware injection, and privilege escalation.

- **Replay Attack Detection in WPA2:**
  - Replay attacks are detected using a 48-bit packet number (PN) present in all CCMP-encrypted data frames. If a frame with a lower PN is received, it is discarded.

- **Attack 3: Wireless DoS Attack**
  - The GTK vulnerability can be exploited to launch a DoS attack. The attacker injects a forged group-addressed data frame with a large PN. Clients update their locally cached PN with the large value. When the AP sends subsequent group-addressed data frames with lower PNs, they are dropped by the clients, disrupting communication.

**3. Attack Mitigation Techniques**

- **a. Client IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**
  - Client-side IDS tools like DecaffeinatID [11] or Snort [12] can detect ARP cache poisoning, inbound connections, and malware injection.
  - **Limitations:** These tools are typically available for Windows or Linux laptops, but many WPA2 networks are accessed by a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.

- **b. PSPF (Peer-to-Peer Blocking) or Client Isolation [5][6]**
  - This feature restricts peer-to-peer communication by blocking traffic between WiFi clients.
  - **Limitations:** Not all controllers or standalone APs support PSPF or client isolation. Additionally, it does not work across multiple access points or controllers.

- **c. Software-Based Solution: Deprecate GTK**
  - The vulnerability can be mitigated by deprecating the use of GTK. For backward compatibility, the AP should send different, randomly generated GTKs to each client, ensuring that all clients have unique copies of GTK at all times.
  - **Limitations:**
    - Reduces network throughput.
    - Requires AP software upgrades.

**4. Conclusion**
WPA2 is vulnerable to insider attacks, and WPA, introduced as a replacement for WEP, is similarly vulnerable due to the same handling of group-addressed data. This limitation, though known to the designers, is not well understood by WiFi users. Our findings show that these exploits can be carried out using off-the-shelf tools with minor modifications. Legitimate WiFi users connecting to WPA or WPA2-enabled WLANs are vulnerable, regardless of the authentication or encryption method used. Several solutions have been proposed to defend against these insider attacks, but a permanent fix is required at the protocol level. In the interim, wireless monitoring devices like WIPS sensors can be used to detect anomalies in wireless traffic.
