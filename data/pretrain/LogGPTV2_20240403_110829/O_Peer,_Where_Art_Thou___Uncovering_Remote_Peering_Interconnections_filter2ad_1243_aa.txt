ABSTRACT
Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are Internet hubs that mainly pro-
vide the switching infrastructure to interconnect networks and
exchange traffic. While the initial goal of IXPs was to bring to-
gether networks residing in the same city or country, and thus keep
local traffic local, this model is gradually shifting. Many networks
connect to IXPs without having physical presence at their switching
infrastructure. This practice, called Remote Peering, is changing the
Internet topology and economy, and has become the subject of a
contentious debate within the network operators’ community. How-
ever, despite the increasing attention it attracts, the understanding
of the characteristics and impact of remote peering is limited. In
this work, we introduce and validate a heuristic methodology for
discovering remote peers at IXPs. We (i) identify critical remote
peering inference challenges, (ii) infer remote peers with high ac-
curacy (>95%) and coverage (93%) per IXP, and (iii) characterize
different aspects of the remote peering ecosystem by applying our
methodology to 30 large IXPs. We observe that remote peering is a
significantly common practice in all the studied IXPs; for the largest
IXPs, remote peers account for 40% of their member base. We also
show that today, IXP growth is mainly driven by remote peering,
which contributes two times more than local peering.

1 INTRODUCTION
Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) are crucial components of today’s
Internet ecosystem [25, 29, 37, 38], that provide infrastructure for
the direct interconnection (peering) of Autonomous Systems (ASes).
Currently, there exist more than 700 IXPs around the world, with
more than 11K member networks (i.e., peers); these correspond to
approximately 20% of the total number of ASes [11, 15, 16]. The
largest IXPs host more than 800 networks each [1, 7], and handle
aggregate traffic that peaks at or exceeds 6 Tbps [3, 8].
IXPs were originally created to locally interconnect ASes at
layer-2 (L2), and keep local traffic local [39]. Under this model, net-
works peer at IXPs to directly connect with each other and avoid
connections through third parties, and thus reduce costs, improve
performance (e.g., lower latency), and better control the exchanged
traffic [26, 67]. However, the ever-increasing traffic flowing at the
edge of the Internet, creates pressure for denser and more diverse
peering that challenges the traditional IXP model. As a result, the
IXP ecosystem is undergoing a fundamental shift in peering prac-
tices to respond to these requirements: networks may establish
peering connections at IXPs from remote locations, to broaden the
set of networks they reach within one AS-hop [41, 69], either over
a (owned or rented) “long cable” or over resellers that provide ports
on the IXP and L2 access through their own network [13, 18]. This
practice contradicts the traditional view of IXPs as local hubs of
direct peering and is commonly referred to as Remote Peering [67]
by IXP operators, where “remote” denotes a distant and/or indirect
IXP connection:
Definition 1. Remote Peering (RP) is when a network peers at
an IXP without having physical presence in the IXP’s infrastructure
and/or through a reseller.
While RP has been actively advertised by IXPs, it has also fired
up a heated debate within the operators’ community [23, 67]. The
proponents of RP highlight the benefits in connectivity and cost re-
duction for the IXP members, whereas the opponents emphasize on
the risks and implications for network performance and resilience.
Irrespective of which side in this debate one stands for, the reality
is that RP is fundamentally changing the IXP peering landscape,
with unclear effects on Internet economics and performance. Today
we lack the tools and techniques to answer even simple questions,
such as “Which peers of an IXP are remote and which are local?”.
The answer to this question could significantly benefit Internet
operations and drive routing policies and peering decisions (e.g.,
eyeballs or content providers that seem local at an IXP may not be
local). Such knowledge is therefore important both for IXP opera-
tors to understand the characteristics of their member base, and IXP
members to perform e.g., traffic engineering (TE) based on peering
policies. Moreover, it enables researchers to explore different facets
of RP ecosystems.
In this paper, we propose a methodology to infer RP, and an-
alyze its main characteristics. Our primary objective is to enable
transparency, a property which is desired by all stakeholders, re-
gardless of which side they pick in the RP debate. We first provide
the necessary background on this debate as well as related work in
Section 2. After presenting our measurement datasets (Section 3),
we make the following contributions:
Identify inference challenges (Section 4). We first identify the
difficulties of inferring RP, by collecting and analyzing a best-effort
validation dataset of remote/local peers in 15 large IXPs. We show
that inference based exclusively on latency measurements, as pro-
posed by Castro et al. [36], is not capable of accurately inferring RP
at scale.
Infer remote peers (Section 5). We design a novel methodology
to infer whether a peer is remote or local to an IXP. Due to the
involved complexity and challenges, we take into account multiple
dimensions of peering, such as latency, colocation and IXP facility
information, IXP port capacity and router connectivity, and combine
them to achieve an accurate inference. Comparing our inferences
against validation data shows that our approach achieves a 95%
accuracy and 93% coverage, while the corresponding percentages
of the state-of-the-art [36] are 77% and 84%, respectively.
Characterize remote peering (Section 6). We apply our method-
ology to 30 large IXPs, and analyze characteristics of RP. While an
extensive evaluation of RP characteristics and implications is out-
side the scope of this work, we consider use cases that exhibit the
applicability of our inference approach. We find that RP is prevalent
today, with 28% of the peers being remote. Our results also show
that today, IXP growth is mainly driven by remote peering, which
contributes two times more than local peering with respect to the
number of new IXP members.
We further discuss relevant insights which arise from our study,
including potential implications of RP (Section 7). Finally, we de-
scribe follow-up research directions, such as traffic analysis and a
large-scale longitudinal study (Section 8).
2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
Peering at IXPs. ASes connect and exchange traffic (i.e., peer) with
each other via bi- or multi-lateral setups at IXPs, which operate
L2 switching platforms. Typically, ASes become members of an
IXP by connecting to its infrastructure through their own router(s),
colocated at the facility where the IXP has presence. This enables
them to peer with other IXP members.
Remote peering at IXPs. Remote peering does not require physi-
cal presence of networks’ routing equipment in the IXP fabric [63].
The connection is performed through: (i) resellers [71] of IXP ports
that connect the remote peer’s router(s) to the IXP switches, (ii) L2
connections (“long cables”) to the IXP facility (with ports bought
by the peer itself), either with privately owned cables or by using
a carrier, and (iii) IXP federations [4, 9], i.e., IXPs belonging to the
same organization (like DE-CIX Frankfurt and DE-CIX New York),
which are interconnected so that local peers of one IXP are remote
to the other and vice versa1.

ically distributed entities, possessing switching infrastructure in

multiple facilities in different metropolitan areas2/countries. We call
such cases, where the IXP’s L2 network spans large geographical
areas, wide-area IXPs. An example of a wide-area IXP is NL-IX [14],
spanning the European continent3. The members of a wide-area IXP
are local peers, as long as they are directly patched to the switching
infrastructure of at least one facility of the IXP (see Definition 1);
otherwise they are remote. Note that such IXP setups can heavily
complicate remote peering inferences (see Section 4.2).
The remote peering debate. The increasing attention that remote
peering is drawing has also given rise to a recent debate within the
networking community [23], placing emphasis on the impact of
remote peering on Internet routing and economics.
Remote peering is good! There are several advantages and new
possibilities for networks peering remotely:
• Monetary savings. CAPEX is reduced since there is no need
for additional routing equipment, or colocation and installation
fees [67, 68]. Remote peering can also be an option for offloading
transit traffic [36].
• Increased connectivity. Networks can easily establish direct con-
nections with more peers (e.g., content providers present at re-
mote IXPs), and have better control over traffic routed from /
towards them.
For the IXP, remote peering leads to:
• More members/customers. IXPs can attract members which are
present in different cities or countries, and thus, increase their
market share. IXPs with many members are more visible and
appealing to potential customers.
• Reseller ecosystem. The IXP can benefit from reseller organiza-
tions, which handle new IXP memberships at scale, and therefore
the setup and billing of new members is simplified.
Remote peering is bad! On the other hand, some network and
IXP operators claim that remote peering is a disservice to the Inter-
net [23, 67]. IXPs have been originally created as peering hubs to
keep “local traffic local” [39]. Changing this trend might lead to:
• Degradation of performance. Links over IXPs involving peers at
distant locations from IXPs are expected to have larger latency
(RTTs) than links between local peers. Hence, direct peering
connections on IXPs might not necessarily lead to improved
quality in communication. Additionally, resellers usually offer
low capacity IXP ports (e.g., 100Mbps; see Section 5.1.1), which
can cause congestion [43].
• Loss of resilience. While a network might have separate L3 con-
nections with its peers on an IXP, in the case of remote peering
some of these connections might share a common port (e.g., re-
sellers sell fractions of the same physical IXP port to multiple
remote peers). A single outage on this port can thus affect (a)
multiple connections, and (b) networks hundreds or thousands
of kilometers away from the IXP. As a result, neither traffic nor
outages “stay local”.
2We consider as metropolitan area a disk with diameter 100 km.
3While IXPs such as DE-CIX may have presence in multiple cities (e.g., Frankfurt,
New York), they are not considered as wide-area IXPs, since they operate an indepen-
dent/separate IXP at each city. In contrast, NL-IX is a sole IXP entity with a network
distributed among multiple countries/cities.

Need for transparency. While there is no consensus on whether
remote peering is a good or bad practice, both its proponents and
opponents acknowledge the necessity for understanding the char-
acteristics of remote peering. Network operators want to know
which peers are local or remote, where they are located, and the
implications on the communication (e.g., latency, bandwidth, re-
silience) among peers. This knowledge is critical since it can guide
traffic engineering and peering policies.
Related work. Prior works on IXPs explore various aspects of the
IXP ecosystem and show its impact on the Internet’s hierarchical
topology [25, 29], traffic exchange economics [40, 57], and content
delivery [30, 39, 73]. Others discuss multilateral peering over IXPs
at scale [49] and show that interconnection strategies, such as RP,
and extensive colocation practices [48], create unexpected interde-
pendencies among peering infrastructures [46]. Other work inves-
tigates the impact of RP [50] on the topology or the performance
of continental peering ecosystems, such as Africa [43]. Castro et
al. [36] aimed to explore the traffic offloading capabilities of RP and
provided a simple RTT-based approach for inferring RP.
