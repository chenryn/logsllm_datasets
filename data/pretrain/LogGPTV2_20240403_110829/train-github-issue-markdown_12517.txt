The solution suggested in #6382 doesn't work as expected. It creates false
`define()` statements in the JavaScript file:

I believe the TypeScript compiler doesn't react correctly in regard to bundled
files.
IMHO, `import { module1.Identifier2, module2.Identifier1 module3.Identifier1 }
from "./moduleFile"` should be the only valid syntax here.
That syntax should result in loading the bundle file and import all the
required modules (which I suppose should become `namespace`s in the generated,
_i.e. referenced, bundled,_ JavaScript file) and identifiers from there.
