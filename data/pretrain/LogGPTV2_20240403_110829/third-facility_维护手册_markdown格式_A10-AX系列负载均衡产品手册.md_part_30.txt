A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Field Description
Session Inserted Number of times the ACOS device received a new fragment that did not match
any existing session (based on source IP, destination ID, and fragment ID).
A fragment session represents multiple fragments that should be reassembled
together into a single logical packet.
Session Expired Number of times a fragment session timed out before all the fragments for the
packet were received.
ICMP Received Number of ICMP fragments received.
ICMPv6 Received Number of ICMPv6 fragments received.
UDP Received Number of UDP fragments received.
TCP Received Number of TCP fragments received.
IP-in-IP Received Number of IP-in-IP fragments received.
IPv6-in-IP Received Number of IPv6-in-IP fragments received.
Other Received Number of other types of fragments received.
ICMP Dropped Number of ICMP fragments that were dropped. This counter and the other
“Dropped” counters below are incremented when a fragment is dropped for
any of the following reasons:
• Invalid length
• Overlap with other fragments
• Exceeded fragmentation session threshold
ICMPv6 Dropped Number of ICMPv6 fragments that were dropped.
UDP Dropped Number of UDP fragments that were dropped.
TCP Dropped Number of TCP fragments that were dropped.
IP-in-IP Dropped Number of IP-in-IP fragments that were dropped.
IPv6-in-IP Dropped Number of IPv6-in-IP fragments that were dropped.
Other Dropped Number of other types of fragments that were dropped.
Overlapping Fragment Drop Number of fragments dropped because the data in the fragment overlapped
with data in another fragment already received by the ACOS device.
Bad IP Length This counter includes both of the following:
• Number of IPv4 packets for which the total length was invalid.
• Number of IPv6 packets for which the payload length was invalid.
Fragment Too Small Drop Number of fragments in which the length of the data was too short. IP frag-
mentation requires at least 8 bytes of data in all except the last fragment.
First TCP Fragment Too Small Drop Number of fragmented TCP packets that did not contain the entire Layer 4
header in the first fragment.
First L4 Fragment Too Small Drop Number of fragmented packets other than TCP packets that did not contain
the entire Layer 4 header in the first fragment.
Total Sessions Exceeded Drop Number of times a fragment was dropped because the maximum number of
concurrent fragment sessions were already in use.
Out of Session Memory Number of times the ACOS device ran out of memory for fragment sessions.
page 293 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Field Description
Fragmentation Fast Aging Set Number of times the ACOS device sped up aging of existing fragment sessions
in order to accommodate new sessions.
Fragmentation Fast Aging Unset Number of times the ACOS device returned to normal aging for fragment ses-
sions.
Fragment Queue Success Number of times a new fragment session was created, or a new fragment was
added to an existing session.
Payload Length Unaligned Number of fragments whose length did not consist of a multiple of 8 bytes.
Note: This counter does not apply to the final fragments of fragmented pack-
ets. The final fragment of a packet is not required to have a length that is a mul-
tiple of 8.
Payload Length Out of Bounds Number of times a fragmented packet’s data length exceeded what should
have been the end of the reassembled packet.
Duplicate First Fragment Number of times a duplicate first fragment was received for the same packet.
Duplicate Last Fragment Number of times a duplicate last fragment was received for the same packet.
Total Queued Fragments Exceeded Number of times the maximum number of concurrent fragmented packets
supported by the ACOS device was exceeded.
Fragment Queue Failure Total number of times a fragmented packet could not be queued to a session,
due to any of the errors listed separately by the following counters:
• Duplicate First Fragment
• Duplicate Last Fragment
• Payload Length Out of Bounds
• Payload Length Unaligned
Fragment Reassembly Success Number of times all fragments for a packet were reassembled successfully.
Fragment Max Data Length Exceeded Number of times the total length of all reassembled fragments for a packet
exceeded 65535. This type of error can indicate an attack such as a ping-of-
death attack.
Fragment Reassembly Failure Total number of fragment reassembly errors, including errors due to unlikely
causes such as memory corruption.
MTU Exceeded Policy Drop Number of packets dropped due to an MTU exceeded policy.
Fragment Processing Drop Number of packets dropped due to errors during fragment processing.
Too Many Packets Per Reassembly Number of packets dropped because too many fragments were received for
Drop the packet.
Session Max Packets Exceeded Number of times the limit for fragmented packets has been reached.
IPv4-in-IPv6 Fragmentation Statistics These are the same as the counters described above, but they apply to packets
fragmented into IPv4 fragments before being sent in the IPv6 tunnel. For exam-
(Not shown in the example above.)
ple, these counters can apply to fragmented DS-Lite traffic.
These counters are displayed if you use the ipv6 option instead of the ip
option.

show ip helper-address
Description Display DHCP relay information.
Syntax show ip helper-address [detail]
Mode All
Example The following command shows summary DHCP relay information:
ACOS(config)#show ip helper-address
Interface Helper-Address RX TX No-Relay Drops
--------- -------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------
eth1 100.100.100.1 0 0 0 0

The following table describes the fields in the command output.
Field Description
Interface ACOS interface. Interfaces appear in the output in either of the fol-
lowing cases:
• A helper address is configured on the interface.
• DHCP packets are sent or received on the interface.
Helper-Address Helper address configured on the interface.
RX Number of DHCP packets received on the interface.
TX Number of DHCP packets sent on the interface.
No-Relay Number of packets that were examined for DHCP relay but were not
relayed, and instead received regular Layer 2/3 processing.
Generally, this counter increments in the following cases:
• DHCP packets are received on an interface that does not have a
helper address and the packets are not destined to the relay.
• DHCP packets are received on an interface that does have a helper
address, but the packets are unicast directly from the client to the
server and do not need relay intervention.
Drops Number of packets that were ineligible for relay and were dropped.
Example The following command shows detailed DHCP relay information:
ACOS#show ip helper-address detail
IP Interface: eth1

Field Description
No-Relay Number of packets that were examined for DHCP relay but were not
relayed, and instead received regular Layer 2/3 processing.
Generally, this counter increments in the following cases:
• DHCP packets are received on an interface that does not have a
helper address and the packets are not destined to the relay.
• DHCP packets are received on an interface that does have a helper
address, but the packets are unicast directly from the client to the
server and do not need relay intervention.
Drops Lists the following counters for packets dropped on the interface:
• Invalid BOOTP Port – Number of packets dropped because they had
UDP destination port 68 (BOOTPC).
• Invalid IP/UDP Len – Number of packets dropped because the IP or
UDP length of the packet was shorter than the minimum required
length for DHCP headers.
• Invalid DHCP Oper – Number of packets dropped because the Op
field in the packet header did not contain BOOTREQUEST or BOOT-
REPLY.
• Exceeded DHCP Hops – Number of packets dropped because the
number in the Hops field was higher than 16.
• Invalid Dest IP – Number of packets dropped because the destina-
tion was invalid for relay.
• Exceeded TTL – Number of packets dropped because the TTL value
was too low (less than or equal to 1).
• No Route to Dest – Number of packets dropped because the relay
agent (ACOS device) did not have a valid forwarding entry towards
the destination.
• Dest Processing Err – Number of packets dropped because the relay
agent experienced an error in sending the packet towards the desti-
