User: I have Python 2.6.1 which came on the Mac I have, but I'd recently downloaded and installed the disk image of 3.1.3 and I'd like to have it available in Terminal, how can I do this?  For instance when I do $ python -V in Terminal I get 2.6.1.
Thanks for any help.
Assistant: The default Python version in Mac OS X needs to stay the default Python version, or things will break. You want to install it alongside with Python 2. This is most likely exactly what happened, but you start Python 3 with python3.
