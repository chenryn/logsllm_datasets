I am currently using Vagrant to create a virtual machine (VM) for running the Google App Engine (GAE) development server, `dev_appserver.py`. The synchronized folder is functioning correctly, and I can view all the files within it. However, after starting the `dev_appserver.py`, any changes made to Python files on the host machine are not dynamically reflected in the VM. To see these updates, I need to restart the `dev_appserver.py` inside the VM.

Additionally, I have Grunt tasks set up to watch HTML and CSS files. These also do not synchronize properly when edited outside the VM. I suspect that the issue might be related to how Vagrant handles file synchronization between the host and the guest machines.

Has anyone encountered this problem and found a solution?

**Solution:**

After some investigation, I discovered a solution. In the latest version of Google App Engine, there is a new parameter available for `dev_appserver.py`: `--use_mtime_file_watcher=True`.

Using this flag, the development server now detects changes to the Python files, although with a slight delay of 1-2 seconds. This allows for a more efficient development workflow without the need to restart the server each time a change is made.

Here's the command to use:

```bash
dev_appserver.py --use_mtime_file_watcher=True
```

This should help in achieving better synchronization and dynamic updates for your development environment.
