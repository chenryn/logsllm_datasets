### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:08:32 to 18:08:37 on October 18, documents a series of connection and lease renewal attempts in an Apache Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Connection Attempts to Resource Manager (RM):**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` component is attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - Each connection attempt is logged with the retry policy: `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`.
   - Multiple `INFO` logs indicate that the system is retrying the connection, each time noting that it has already tried 0 times.
   - Corresponding `ERROR` logs from `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator` indicate that the attempts to contact the RM are failing.

2. **Address Change Detection:**
   - There are several `WARN` logs from `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` indicating address changes for both the RM server (`msra-sa-41:8030`) and the LeaseRenewer (`msra-sa-41:9000`).
   - The old address for the RM server is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The old address for the LeaseRenewer is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000`.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - `WARN` logs from `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer` indicate that the lease renewal is failing, with the duration of failure increasing by one second in each subsequent log entry (from 215 seconds to 219 seconds).
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

### Conclusion
The log entries suggest that there are ongoing issues with connecting to the Resource Manager and renewing the lease for a specific DFS client. The system is detecting address changes and attempting to retry the operations, but the attempts are failing. This could indicate network instability or configuration issues that need to be addressed.
