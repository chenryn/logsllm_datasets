User: Hi My app had visitors and I like to analyze the log file. Can I run a log analyzer program on the log file that google app engine allows us to download? Are third-party programs such as webalizer and visitors compatible? 
Thank you
Assistant: I suggest you use Google Analytics on your web app.  If you want to do some sort of server-side visitor analaytics (instead of the client-side Javascript that Google Analytics uses), you'd have to store something in a database (BigTable on GAE) and run your own analytics.
