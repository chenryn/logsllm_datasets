### Third Party Consent: U.S. v. Andrus, 483 F.3d 711 (10th Cir. D. Kan. April 25, 2007)

#### Background
- **Dr. Andrus' Interaction with Officers:**
  - Dr. Andrus, aged 91, answered the door in his pajamas.
  - He invited the officers into his home and informed them that his son, Ray, lived in the center bedroom to care for his elderly parents.
  - The bedroom door was open, and Dr. Andrus stated that he had access to the room and felt free to enter when the door was open, though he would knock if it was closed.

- **Consent to Search:**
  - Dr. Andrus gave consent to the officers to search the house and the computers within it.

#### District Court Ruling
- **Voluntary Consent but Lack of Authority:**
  - The District Court determined that Dr. Andrus' consent was voluntary but lacked actual authority to consent to a computer search.
  - Dr. Andrus did not know how to use the computer, had never used it, and did not know the username required to access it.

- **Apparent Authority:**
  - The court considered whether Dr. Andrus had apparent authority to consent to the search:
    1. An email address associated with Dr. Andrus was used to register with Regpay and procure child pornography.
    2. Dr. Andrus paid the household’s internet access bill.
    3. Agents knew several individuals lived in the household.
    4. The bedroom door was not locked, leading a reasonable officer to believe other members of the household could have had access to it.
    5. The computer was in plain view and appeared available for anyone’s use.
  - The court concluded that it was a "close call" but found that Dr. Andrus had apparent authority to consent to the search.

#### Appellate Level
- **Expectation of Privacy:**
  - The 10th Circuit noted that items such as valises, suitcases, footlockers, and strong boxes are associated with a high expectation of privacy.
  - The court likened an individual's expectation of privacy in computers to that of a suitcase or briefcase, citing U.S. v. Aaron, 2002 WL 511557 (6th Cir. April 3, 2002).
  - Password-protected files were compared to locked footlockers, as in Trulock v. Freeh, 275 F.3d 391 (4th Cir. 2001).

- **Reasonable Officer Standard:**
  - The court acknowledged that EnCase software allows user profiles and passwords to be bypassed but did not address the issue of identifying passwords.
  - The critical issue was whether law enforcement knew or reasonably suspected the computer was password-protected.
  - The court held that officers are not obligated to ask questions unless circumstances are ambiguous and that password protection is not so pervasive that officers should assume it is likely.

- **Ray Andrus' Subsequent Consent:**
  - Ray Andrus later provided voluntary consent to the search.

### Revoking Consent

#### United States v. Ward, 576 F.2d 243 (9th Cir. 1978) and Mason v. Pulliam, 557 F.2d 426 (5th Cir. 1977)
- **Revocation of Consent:**
  - Both cases dealt with the revocation of consent concerning financial documents provided to the IRS.
  - Taxpayers revoked consent to search financial documents, and the courts suppressed evidence taken after consent was withdrawn but not before.

#### Jones v. Berry, 722 F.2d 443 (9th Cir. 1983)
- **IRS Seizure:**
  - IRS agents seized sixteen boxes of documents with permission. The defendant later revoked consent and demanded the return of the documents.
  - The Ninth Circuit held that documents seized prior to the revocation of consent were not taken in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

#### U.S. v. Andracek, 2007 WL 1575355 (E.D.Wis., May 30, 2007)
- **Threat of Warrant:**
  - The defendant did not revoke consent in light of a threat to subsequently obtain a warrant.
  - The court held that obtaining a warrant is adherence to the Constitution and cannot be considered a threat.

### Searches- Consent

#### U.S. v. Stierhoff, --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2007 WL 763984 (D. R.I. March 13, 2007)
- **Exceeding Scope of Consent:**
  - The government exceeded the scope of consent to a computer search when they opened an "offshore" file without a warrant, discovering evidence of tax evasion.

#### U.S. v. Dehghani, 2007 WL 710184 (W.D. Mo. March 06, 2007)
- **Child Pornography Allegation:**
  - Police requested consent to search a computer based on allegations of child pornography.
  - The defendant argued that the police did not have a warrant and failed to seize CDs and search another computer in the home.
  - The court held that the defendant’s express voluntary consent to search the computer for child pornography was valid.

### Special Needs

#### United States v. Heckenkamp, --- F.3d ----, 2007 WL 1051579 (9th Cir. N.D. Cal. Apr 05, 2007)
- **Special Needs Exception:**
  - A limited warrantless remote search of the defendant’s personal computer was justified under the "special needs" exception to the warrant requirement.
  - A subsequent search of the dorm room was justified based on information obtained independently.

### Searches- Methods

#### U.S. v. Vilar, 2007 WL 1075041 (S.D.N.Y., Apr 04, 2007)
- **Warrant Requirements:**
  - A warrant must state what materials are to be seized from a computer but need not specify the search methodology.
  - The Supreme Court has held that the details of how best to proceed with a search authorized by a warrant are generally left to the discretion of the executing officers.

### Work Place

#### U.S. v. Barrows, --- F.3d ----, 2007 WL 970165 (10th Cir. W.D. Okla. Apr 03, 2007)
- **Expectation of Privacy:**
  - The court considered whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a personal computer brought to work and connected to the city network.
  - Factors included the employee's relationship to the item, control over the item, and actions to maintain privacy.
  - The court found no reasonable expectation of privacy due to the lack of a password, the open area placement, and the connection to the network.

### Private Search/Agent of Law Enforcement

#### U.S. v. Anderson, 2007 WL 1121319 (N.D. Ind., Apr 16, 2007)
- **Private Search:**
  - A computer repair shop observed child pornography images while fixing a computer.
  - The employees were not agents of law enforcement, and their actions were part of normal repair procedures.
  - The court held that the Fourth Amendment is violated if the government's search exceeds the scope of the private search.

### Web Pages & ISP

#### Doe v. Mark Bates and Yahoo, Slip Copy, 2006 WL 3813758 (E.D.Tex. Dec. 27, 2006)
- **Section 230 Immunity:**
  - Yahoo was not liable in a civil case for hosting a child pornography online group set up and moderated by a user.
  - The court ruled that Section 230 immunity applies, even if Yahoo allegedly broke the law by hosting child pornography.
  - Allowing such suits would have a chilling effect on online speech.

### Copyright – The Complaint

#### Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, LLC and Google, Inc., Civil Action No. 07 CV 2103 (S.D.N.Y. March 13, 2007)
- **Infringement Allegations:**
  - Viacom alleged that YouTube willfully infringed copyrights on a large scale.
  - YouTube was accused of building a library of infringing works to draw traffic to its site.
  - The complaint highlighted that YouTube profits from the availability of popular infringing works and shifts the burden onto copyright owners to monitor and remove infringing content.
  - YouTube’s features, such as "embed," "share," and "friends," allow users to make hidden videos available to others.
