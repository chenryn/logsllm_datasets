2007)

 Informs officers Ray lives in center bedroom; did not pay rent; 
living here to care for his elderly parents

Third Party Consent
 U.S. v. Andrus, 483 F.3d 711 (10th Cir. D. Kan. 
April 25, 2007)
 District Court determined Dr. Andrus’ consent was 
voluntary, but lacked actual authority to consent to a 
computer search. Dr. Andrus did not know how to use the 
computer, had never used the computer, and did not know 
the user name that would have allowed him to access the 
computer. The district court then proceeded to consider 
apparent authority. It indicated the resolution of the 
apparent authority claim in favor of the government was a 
“close call.”
 Dr. Andrus authority to consent to a search of the computer 
reasonable until learned only one computer. Because 
Cheatham instructed Kanatzar to suspend search no 
Fourth Amendment violation.

Third Party Consent
 U.S. v. Andrus, 483 F.3d 711 (10th Cir. D. Kan. April 
25, 2007)
 District Court, Apparent authority because:
 (1) Email address PI:EMAIL associated with Dr. 
Bailey Andrus, used to register with Regpay and procure child 
pornography; 
 (2) Dr. Andrus told the agents he paid the household’s internet 
access bill; 
 (3) Agents knew several individuals lived in the household; 
 (4) Bedroom door not locked, leading a reasonable officer to 
believe other members of the household could have had 
access to it; 
 (5) Computer in plain view of anyone who entered the room 
and appeared available for anyone’s use. Implicit in the district 
court’s analysis assumption that officers could reasonably 
believe Dr. Andrus accessed the internet through computer in  
bedroom, giving Dr. Andrus the authority to consent to a 
search of the computer.

 At Appellate level
 Objects associated with high expectation of privacy include 
valises, suitcases, footlockers, and strong boxes.
 Case of first impression for 10th Circuit.  Court notes 
individual’s expectation of privacy in computers has been 
likened to a suitcase or briefcase. U.S. v. Aaron, 2002 WL 
511557 (6th Cir. April 3, 2002) 
 Password protected files compared to locked footlockers. 
Trulock v. Freeh, 275 F.3d 391 (4th Cir. 2001)
 For most people, their computers are their most private 
spaces. People commonly talk about the bedroom as a very 
private space, yet when they have parties, all the guests—
including perfect strangers —are invited to toss their coats on 
the bed. But if one of those guests is caught exploring the 
host’s computer, that will be his last invitation. United States v. 
Gourde, 440 F.3d 1065, 1077 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc)(Kleinfeld, 
J., dissenting).

 U.S. v. Andrus, 483 F.3d 711 (10th Cir. D. Kan. April 
25, 2007)
 Looking good for home team and locked computer 
files, then-
 Reasonable officer and knowing or seeing the a 
computer or file is locked, visual inspection, not 
apparent
 Password or locked may only be discovered by starting 
up the machine or attempting access to file
 Court acknowledges the EnCase allows user profiles 
and passwords to be by passed.  Court fails to 
acknowledge that it can also be set up to identify 
passwords
 Critical issue- whether LEA knows or reasonably 
suspects computer is password protected

Third Party Consent
 U.S. v. Andrus, 483 F.3d 711 (10th Cir. D. Kan. April 
25, 2007)
 Critical issue- whether LEA knows or reasonably suspects 
computer is password protected
 Computer in bedroom occupied by 51 year old son
 Dr unlimited or at will access to room (Court forgets when 
door closed Dr knocks and doesn’t simply go in)
 No specific questions to this 91 year old about his use of PC 
but Dr said nothing indicating need for such questions (shift 
of burden here??)
 Dr owned house and internet bill in his name (okay)
 Email address his initials bandrus (iffy at best)
 Defendant argument- PC locked cops would have known 
if they asked.
 Court reply- officers are not obligated to ask questions unless 
circumstances are ambiguous.
 Court doesn’t feel password protection so pervasive that 
officers ought to know password protection likely.  Comments 
that dissent wants to take judicial notice of this fact.

 And lastly, being a former Gov’t Hack. . . 
 The “seen” lock argument.  Pretty damn good cops that

 EnCase easily configured to first check for users and

Revoking Consent
United States v. Ward, 576 F.2d 243 (9th Cir. 1978); Mason v. Pulliam, 
557 F.2d 426 (5th Cir. 1977). 
Both dealt with the revocation of consent concerning financial documents provided to the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS). In both cases, the taxpayers revoked consent to search financial 
documents and the courts suppressed evidence taken from the records after consent had been 
withdrawn. While these courts suppressed certain documents seized after consent was revoked, 
neither court suppressed incriminating evidence discovered prior to the revocation. 
Jones v. Berry, 722 F.2d 443 (9th Cir. 1983)
IRS agents received permission to search a residence and seized sixteen boxes of documents. On 
that same day, after documents seized, defendant revoked consent and demanded the return of the 
documents. The IRS refused to return the documents. 
Ninth Circuit held documents properly seized prior to the revocation of consent were not taken in 
violation of the fourth amendment. The holding requires only the suppression of evidence 
discovered after the consent had been revoked. 
No claim can be made that items seized in the course of a consent search, if found, must be 
returned when consent is revoked. Such a rule would lead to the implausible result that 
incriminating evidence seized in the course of a consent search could be retrieved by a revocation 
of consent.
U.S. v. Andracek, 2007 WL 1575355 (E.D.Wis., May 30, 2007)
 Defendant does not revoke consent in light of threat to subsequently 
obtain a warrant.  Still voluntary.
As for the agents' statements indicating that they would be requesting a warrant if 
Andracek did not consent to the seizure of his computer, this can hardly be considered a 
threat. This was a logical alternative if Andracek did not consent to the seizure of his 
computer. Obtaining a warrant is adherence to the text of the Constitution, and in particular, 
the Fourth Amendment. Under the attendant circumstances, the agent's statement to abide 
by the Constitution and seek a warrant cannot be considered a threat.
Searches- Consent
 U.S. v. Stierhoff, --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2007 WL 763984 
(D. R.I. March 13, 2007)
 Government exceeded scope of consent to 
computer search, given by defendant arrested for 
stalking, when conducting authorized search of 
"creative writing" file authorities saw reference to 
"offshore" file, which they opened without 
warrant, discovering evidence of tax evasion.
 Defendant a stalker
 Consents to search of computer and instructs police 
officers that files are located D:Drive MyFiles directory 
Creative Writing folder.
 $100,000+ in plain view, defendant admits he hasn’t paid 
taxes in a while
 Offshore folder on computer, officer looks at it
 Search as to Offshore folder and derivative evidence 
exceeded scope of consent
Searches- Consent
 U.S. v. Dehghani, 2007 WL 710184 (W.D. Mo. March 06, 
2007)
 Police to defendants based upon allegation of child pornography 
and associated screen name to residence.
 Request for consent to search computer 
 On-Site attempt to analyze fails
 Permission to take off-site granted
 Off-site forensics reveals evidence
 Defendant argues that the police had no search warrant, they did
not specifically state that his computer would be searched or 
seized, they failed to seize the 25-30 CD's lying next to the 
computer, failed to search another computer in the home.
 It appears he may have believed the police would not have access
to the pornography on the computer because they did not have 
defendant's passwords. However, defendant has offered no legal 
authority for how his assumption, if indeed it existed, would 
override his express voluntary consent to search his computer for 
child pornography
Computer Search 
Special Needs
 United States v. Heckenkamp, --- F.3d ----, 2007 WL 
1051579 (9th Cir. N.D. Cal. Apr 05, 2007)
 Denial of motions to suppress evidence in a 
prosecution for recklessly causing damage by 
intentionally accessing a protected computer without 
authorization are affirmed where: 1) although 
defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in 
his personal computer, a limited warrantless remote 
search of the computer was justified under the 
"special needs" exception to the warrant requirement; 
and 2) a subsequent search of his dorm room was 
justified, based on information obtained by means 
independent of a university search of the room
Searches- Methods
 U.S. v. Vilar, 2007 WL 1075041 (S.D.N.Y., Apr 04, 2007)
 Warrant must state what materials to be seized from computer 
it need not specify how computers will be searched. 
 There is no case law holding officer must justify the lack of a 
search protocol in order to support issuance of the warrant.  
 Government not required to describe its specific search 
methodology. 
 Warrant not defective because it did not include a computer 
search methodology. 
 But see 3817 W. West End, 321 F.Supp2d at 960-62 requiring 
that computer search warrant include a search protocol
 Supreme Court has held that it is generally left to the 
discretion of the executing officers to determine the details of
how best to proceed with the performance of a search 
authorized by warrant.

Work Place
 U.S. v. Barrows, --- F.3d ----, 2007 WL 970165 (10th 
Cir. W.D. Okla. Apr 03, 2007)
 Does defendant possess a reasonable expectation of 
privacy in his personal computer he brought to work; 
placed on a common desk; and, connected it via the city 
network to the common computer sufficient to warrant 
protection from a government search? 
 Focus on surrounding circumstances - (1) the employee's 
relationship to the item seized; (2) whether the item was in 
the immediate control of the employee when it was seized; 
and (3) whether the employee took actions to maintain his 
privacy in the item.
 No password; left constantly in open area; and, knowingly 
hooked PC up to network to share files 
Computer Search 
Private Search/Agent of Law Enforcement
 U.S. v. Anderson, 2007 WL 1121319 (N.D. Ind., Apr 
16, 2007)
 Computer repair shop fixes computer, observes 
numerous child pornography thumbnail images 
 Employees not agents of LEA, contracted to fix 
operating system, opening files normal part of 
checking to see if new installation of OS worked
 When a private search has occurred, and the 
government subsequently searches, whether the 
Fourth Amendment is violated depends on the 
degree to which the government's search 
exceeds the scope of the private search.
Web Pages & ISP
 Doe v. Mark Bates and Yahoo, Slip Copy, 2006 WL 3813758 
(E.D.Tex. Dec. 27, 2006) 
 Yahoo not liable in civil case for child pornography online 
group set up and moderated by a user on its servers. 
 User in jail 
 Civil suit targeted the ISP, Court ruled Section 230 immunity, 
even though  alleged Yahoo broken law by hosting child porn. 
 No civil cases against site owners or hosting providers using 
allegation of criminal conduct to get around Section 230. Law 
intended to foster self-regulation of obscene and illegal 
content by service providers, and immunity is an important 
aspect of that. 
 Court - to allow suits on either basis (alleging criminal activity, 
or that any level of regulation creates liability) would have a 
chilling effect on online speech, which is something Congress 
didn't want to do in enacting the law.

 YouTube has harnessed technology to willfully infringe 
copyrights on a huge scale
 YouTube’s brazen disregard of the intellectual property 
laws
 Defendants actively engage in, promote and induce this 
infringement.  Youtube itself publicly performs the

 Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, LLC and Google, 
Inc., Civil Action No. 07 CV 2103 (S.D.N.Y. March 13, 
2007)
 YouTube deliberately built up a library of infringing works 
to draw traffic to the Youtube site
 Because Youtube directly profits from the availability of 
popular infringing works on its site, it has decided to shift 
the burden entirely onto copyright owners to monitor the 
YouTube site on a daily or hourly basis to detect infringing 
videos and send notices to Youtube demanding that it 
“take down” the infringing works.
 In many instances the very same infringing video remains 
on Youtube because it was uploaded by at least one other 
user, or appears on Youtube again within hours of its 
removal.
 YouTube allows its users to make the hidden videos 
available to others through YouTube features like the 
“embed” “share” and “friends” functions

Inc., Civil Action No. 07 CV 2103 (S.D.N.Y. March 13, 
2007)
 YouTube has filled its library with entire episodes and 
movies and significant segments of popular copyrighted 
programming… When a user uploads a video, Youtube 
copies the video in its software format, adds it to its own 
servers, and makes it available for viewing on its own 
website.  A user who wants to view a video goes to the 
YouTube site by typing www.youtube.com into the user’s 
web browser, enters search terms into a search and 
indexing function provided by YouTube for this purpose 
on its site, and receives a list of thumbnails of videos in 
the YouTube library matching those terms.  Youtube 
creates the thumbnails, which are individual frames from 
videos in its library – including infringing videos – for the 
purpose of helping users find what they are searching for.
