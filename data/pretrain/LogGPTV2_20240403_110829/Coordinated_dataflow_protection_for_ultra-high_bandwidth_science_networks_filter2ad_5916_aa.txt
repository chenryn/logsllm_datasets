Abstract
The Science DMZ (SDMZ) is a special purpose network architec-
ture proposed by ESnet (Energy Sciences Network) to facilitate dis-
tributed science experimentation on terabyte- (or petabyte-) scale
data, exchanged over ultra-high bandwidth WAN links. Critical se-
curity challenges faced by these networks include: (i) network moni-
toring at high bandwidths, (ii) reconciling site-specific policies with
project-level policies for conflict-free policy enforcement, (iii) deal-
ing with geographically-distributed datasets with varying levels of
sensitivity, and (iv) dynamically enforcing appropriate security rules.
To address these challenges, we develop a fine-grained dataflow-
based security enforcement system, called CoordiNetZ (CNZ),
that provides coordinated situational awareness, i.e., the use of
context-aware tagging for policy enforcement using the dynamic
contextual information derived from hosts and network elements.
We also developed tag and IP-based security microservices that
incur minimal overheads in enforcing security to data flows
exchanged across geographically-distributed SDMZ sites. We
evaluate our prototype implementation across two geographically
distributed SDMZ sites with SDN-based case studies, and present
performance measurements that respectively highlight the utility
of our framework and demonstrate efficient implementation of
security policies across distributed SDMZ networks.
1 Introduction
The need for computation over petabyte-scale datasets introduces
complexities with respect to: (i) cost-effective provisioning of
compute and storage resources, and (ii) secure transport of high-
throughput experimental data across geographically-distributed
datacenters. To mitigate these concerns, a new network architecture
has been proposed called the Science DMZ (SDMZ) [9], in which an
enterprise subnet is isolated from stateful deep-packet inspection
(DPI) middleboxes (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems
(IPSs)) for optimized performance. Geographically-distributed
SDMZ sites are inter-connected through high-performance network
backbones, such as the ESNet (Energy Sciences Network) [11],
which connects more than 40 U.S. Department of Energy (DoE)
research sites and 150+ campus networks that collectively exchange
more than 50 petabytes of data each month [11, 12]. Today, there
are more than 100 such national research and educational networks
present across the globe connecting thousands of research institutes
using dedicated ultra high bandwidth WAN links [29].

However, implementing security policy for effectively managing
such ultra-high-volume data transfers without sacrificing under-
lying transport performance and throughput remains a formidable
challenge. Our paper is motivated by the observation that security
mechanisms currently implemented in SDMZ networks fall short
along multiple dimensions.
(1) Coarse-grained Enforcement: Deployed security mechanisms are
too coarse-grained (IP, port-level ACLs) using router-based ac-
cess control lists (ACLs) and aggressive filtering for handling
high-performance science applications that exchange potentially
sensitive, proprietary, or personal-private information across in-
terconnected multi-institutional networks [9, 40].
(2) Context Awareness: Humongous volumes of data exchanged
across SDMZs prevents the network-monitoring plane of SDMZ
(e.g., a network intrusion detection system (NIDS)) from effec-
tively deriving dynamic and fine-grained filtering decisions for
enforcing security policies based on dynamic operational con-
text (i.e., who, what, where, when and how the data resources are
accessed or requested). The lack of application awareness, DPI
capabilities, and contextual information leaves wide gaps in the
SDMZ security architecture [39].
(3) Intuitive Policy Specification: SDMZ project users (e.g., re-
searchers, professors, and students) have no method to directly
capture their policy intents and enforce them onto the network
without conflicting with other user’s policy intents or site-specific
policies.
(4) Security as a Service: Finally, current tier-2 SDMZ networks lack
infrastructure support to effectively utilize dynamic security and
data analysis services provided by tier-0/1 SDMZ compute centers
(e.g., DDoS protection and data analysis) [6, 24].

work, called CoordiNetZ, which provides a graph-based dataflow
policy management framework that enables users to express antici-
pated experimental interactions and automatically arbitrate conflicts
with respect to project- and site-specific policies. This high-level
abstraction is important, as science project policies must be flexibly
specified by researchers rather than by administrators. CoordiNetZ
addresses the lack of application- and context-awareness through
a novel context-aware policy-based tagging mechanism (cTags),
which allows dataflows to be associated with tags enabling
fine-grained control on cross-site dataflow filtering. Necessary
optimizations are proposed to effectively utilize the limited tag-space
(20 bits Flow Label packet header of IPv6) that is available for using
it across sites, while optimizing the number of rules required to en-
force the policies. CoordiNetZ integrates host-specific application
context to network nodes and monitoring plane, enabling them to
filter traffic by routing through light-weight security functions built
as microservices for fine-grained policy enforcement.
The notable contributions of this paper are as follows:
• Identification of several key SDMZ security requirements (§2)
that motivate the design and prototype implementation of a
distributed SDN-based policy enforcement framework (§3).
• We present novel conflict detection and resolution mechanisms
that allow policies specified by various SDMZ users using
graph-based abstractions belonging to different sites and projects
to be effectively reconciled (§4).
• We develop context-aware policy-based tagging that allows
dataflows to be associated with tags enabling fine-grained control
of project- and experiment-specific cross-site dataflows (§5).
• We present key security use-cases that demonstrate the benefits
of CoordiNetZ framework in Appendix §A.2 and comprehensive
performance evaluation of the CoordiNetZ prototype (§6).
2 SDMZ Background
The SDMZ network architecture has proven to be a vital platform
for storing and transporting petabytes of scientific data (per month)
across geographically-distributed research testbeds and data
repositories in US and Europe (shown in Figure 1) [11, 12]. As shown
in Figure 2, noteworthy elements of the SDMZ architecture that
are optimized for performance include the following:
1. DTNs and applications customized to support data transfers at
10–100 Gbps [1].
2. SDMZ network perimeter architecture that bypasses stateful
firewalls and DPI devices for high-throughput data transfers of
elephant flows [39].
3. A dedicated SDMZ core network with capacity to carry more
than 100 Gbps of science dataflow rates without loss.1
The SDMZ network differs from enterprise networks in how it
manages the data flows (i.e., elephant dataflows) across geograph-
ically distributed locations. Specifically, SDMZs employ specialized
applications (e.g., Grid FTP) to transmit parallel (multi-port) data
streams across SDMZ sites. These host DTNs and their applications
1Considering the growing bandwidth requirements of SDMZ applications, the SDMZ
core network is soon expected to get upgraded to 400 Gbps [38]

are customized to handle high-performance TCP, and are limited
to running a few “trusted” data-transfer applications.
The SDMZ network is also distinguished from other cross-domain
networks such as software-defined WANs (SD-WANs) [16, 18],
software-defined data centers (SDDCs) and multi-tenant cloud
networks [3, 25] in that the SDMZ network is multi-tenant network
that shares experimental data across multiple sites that are geo-
graphically distributed, spanning multiple administrative domains.
In addition, the day-to-day policy requirements in these network
infrastructures are specific to the experiments and associated data
outcomes and the rules for sharing of data across collaborators are
required to be specified by non-admin SDMZ users (e.g., researchers,
students). However, existing policy frameworks including the
new SDN-based frameworks are not designed to handle dynamic
dataflow-based policy requirements of these multi-administrative
cross-domain science networks [2, 21, 36, 42, 46].
2.1 SDMZ Security Requirements
Today, SDMZ security is provided primarily through offline pro-
tection, such as from clustered IDS (e.g., BroIDS [5]), router/switch
ACLs and selective fastpath of high-bandwidth flows (e.g., Sci-
Pass [40]). However, SDMZs currently offer no way to capture and
