## Abstract
The Science DMZ (SDMZ) is a specialized network architecture proposed by ESnet (Energy Sciences Network) to facilitate distributed scientific experiments involving terabyte- or petabyte-scale data over ultra-high bandwidth WAN links. Critical security challenges in these networks include:
1. Monitoring at high bandwidths,
2. Reconciling site-specific and project-level policies for conflict-free enforcement,
3. Managing geographically-distributed datasets with varying sensitivity levels, and
4. Dynamically enforcing appropriate security rules.

To address these challenges, we developed CoordiNetZ (CNZ), a fine-grained dataflow-based security enforcement system that provides coordinated situational awareness through context-aware tagging. We also created tag and IP-based security microservices to enforce security with minimal overhead on data flows exchanged across geographically-distributed SDMZ sites. Our prototype implementation was evaluated across two geographically distributed SDMZ sites using SDN-based case studies, demonstrating the utility of our framework and efficient policy enforcement in distributed SDMZ networks.

## 1. Introduction
Handling petabyte-scale datasets introduces complexities in:
1. Cost-effective provisioning of compute and storage resources, and
2. Secure transport of high-throughput experimental data across geographically-distributed data centers.

To address these issues, the Science DMZ (SDMZ) architecture [9] isolates an enterprise subnet from stateful deep-packet inspection (DPI) middleboxes (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems) to optimize performance. Geographically-distributed SDMZ sites are interconnected through high-performance backbones like ESNet, which connects over 40 U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) research sites and 150+ campus networks, exchanging more than 50 petabytes of data monthly [11, 12]. Over 100 national research and educational networks globally use dedicated ultra-high bandwidth WAN links to connect thousands of research institutes [29].

However, implementing effective security policies for such high-volume data transfers without compromising transport performance remains challenging. Current security mechanisms in SDMZ networks fall short in several areas:
1. **Coarse-grained Enforcement:** Deployed security mechanisms (e.g., IP, port-level ACLs) are too coarse-grained for handling sensitive, proprietary, or personal-private information [9, 40].
2. **Context Awareness:** The large volumes of data prevent the network-monitoring plane from making dynamic, fine-grained filtering decisions based on operational context [39].
3. **Intuitive Policy Specification:** Users have no method to directly capture and enforce their policy intents without conflicting with other users' or site-specific policies.
4. **Security as a Service:** Tier-2 SDMZ networks lack infrastructure support to utilize dynamic security and data analysis services provided by tier-0/1 SDMZ compute centers [6, 24].

To address these limitations, we introduce CoordiNetZ, a graph-based dataflow policy management framework. CoordiNetZ enables users to express anticipated experimental interactions and automatically arbitrate conflicts with project- and site-specific policies. It uses a novel context-aware policy-based tagging mechanism (cTags) to associate dataflows with tags, enabling fine-grained control. Optimizations are proposed to effectively use the limited tag-space (20 bits Flow Label packet header of IPv6) while minimizing the number of rules required for policy enforcement. CoordiNetZ integrates host-specific application context into the network nodes and monitoring plane, allowing traffic to be filtered through lightweight security functions built as microservices.

The key contributions of this paper are:
- Identification of key SDMZ security requirements (§2) motivating the design and implementation of a distributed SDN-based policy enforcement framework (§3).
- Novel conflict detection and resolution mechanisms for reconciling policies specified by various SDMZ users (§4).
- Development of context-aware policy-based tagging for fine-grained control of cross-site dataflows (§5).
- Demonstration of key security use-cases and comprehensive performance evaluation of the CoordiNetZ prototype (Appendix §A.2 and §6).

## 2. SDMZ Background
The SDMZ network architecture is essential for storing and transporting petabytes of scientific data per month across geographically-distributed research testbeds and data repositories in the US and Europe (Figure 1) [11, 12]. Key elements of the SDMZ architecture optimized for performance include:
1. DTNs and applications customized for 10–100 Gbps data transfers [1].
2. SDMZ network perimeter architecture bypassing stateful firewalls and DPI devices for high-throughput data transfers [39].
3. A dedicated SDMZ core network capable of carrying more than 100 Gbps of science dataflow rates without loss [38].

SDMZs differ from enterprise networks in managing data flows (e.g., elephant flows) across geographically distributed locations. They use specialized applications (e.g., Grid FTP) to transmit parallel (multi-port) data streams. Host DTNs and their applications are customized for high-performance TCP and are limited to running a few "trusted" data-transfer applications.

SDMZs are also distinct from other cross-domain networks like SD-WANs, SDDCs, and multi-tenant cloud networks. SDMZs are multi-tenant networks sharing experimental data across multiple geographically distributed sites, spanning multiple administrative domains. Day-to-day policy requirements in these infrastructures are specific to experiments and associated data outcomes, and rules for data sharing must be specified by non-admin SDMZ users (e.g., researchers, students). However, existing policy frameworks, including new SDN-based ones, are not designed to handle the dynamic dataflow-based policy requirements of these multi-administrative cross-domain science networks [2, 21, 36, 42, 46].

### 2.1 SDMZ Security Requirements
Current SDMZ security primarily relies on offline protection, such as clustered IDS (e.g., BroIDS [5]), router/switch ACLs, and selective fastpath of high-bandwidth flows (e.g., SciPass [40]). However, SDMZs currently lack a way to capture and enforce dynamic, fine-grained security policies.
