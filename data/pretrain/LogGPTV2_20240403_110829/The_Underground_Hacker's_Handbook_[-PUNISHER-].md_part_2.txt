Learning Linux
Now that you have Ubuntu up and running you might be wondering what
to do next. You should now start to learn and eventually master the Linux
distribution of your choice. You’ll find that almost every distribution has a massive
community that is ready to help you, and it’s only a Google search away! For
example if you choose to stick with Ubuntu, http://ubuntuforums.org/ has a
community of 700,000 members! So if you have a question or problems ask away,
there will always be someone out there with a solution.
I would also recommend buying a book. Reading is the best way to gain
knowledge. Below I have a list of some great books you should take a look at.
• A Practical Guide to LinuxI Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming
• Understanding the Linux Kernel, Third Edition
• A Practical Guide to Ubuntu LinuxI
• How Linux Works
There are many websites on the internet dedicated to teaching the community
about Linux. Below I have a list of a few good ones:
• Official Linux Website
• Begin Linux
• Linux Tutorials
For those of you that are visual learners, below are two great video courses.
• Introduction to Linux
• Ubuntu Linux Tutorials
The resources listed above are more than enough for you to master the ins and
outs of Linux. So choose a book, website, or video and begin to take in some more
knowledge!

Chapter Four
Passwords
33
Nowadays, passwords are the only form of security on most websites and
computer systems. It has become one of the most common and easiest ways for a
hacker to gain unauthorized access to your computer or network.
Password Cracking
Before we get into cracking passwords with programs, I will explain a
couple old-fashioned ways to obtain someone’s password.
• Social Engineering – Social engineering is when a hacker takes
advantage of trusting human beings to get information from them.
For example, if the hacker was trying to get the password for a co-
workers computer, he (Even though I use “he”, hackers are of both
genders, and I just chose to use “he” in these examples.) could call
the co-worker pretending to be from the IT department. The
conversation could be something like:
Bob- “Hello Suzy. My name is Bob and I’m from the IT
department. We are currently attempting to install a new
security update on your computer, but we can’t seem to
connect to the user database and extract your user
information. Would you mind helping me out and letting me
know your password before my boss starts breathing down my
neck? It’s one of those days, ya’ know?”
Suzy would probably feel bad for Bob and let him know her password
without any hesitation. BAM! She got social engineered. Now the
hacker can do whatever he pleases with her account.
• Shoulder surfing – Shoulder surfing is exactly what it sounds like. The
hacker would simply attempt to look over your shoulder as you type
in your password. The hacker may also watch weather you glance
around your desk, looking for a written reminder or the written
password itself.
• Guessing – If you use a weak password, a hacker could simple guess
it by using the information he knows about you. Some examples of
34
this are: date of birth, phone number, favorite pet, and other simple
things like these.
Now that we have the simple low-tech password cracking techniques
out of the way, let’s explore some high-tech techniques. Some of the
programs I will use in my examples may be blocked by your anti-virus
programs when you attempt to run them. Make sure you disable your anti-
virus program when you decide to download and explore them.
There are different ways a hacker can go about cracking a password.
Below I will explain and give an example of each way.
Dictionary Attacks
A dictionary attack is when a text file full of commonly used passwords, or a
list of every word from the dictionary is used against a password database. Strong
passwords usually aren’t vulnerable to this kind of attack. In the following
example, I will use Brutus, a very common password cracker, to show a dictionary
attack against an ftp server. Brutus is a Windows only program, but at the end of
this chapter I will list a couple more password crackers, some of which are made
for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
Before I get into the example, you must first know what an FTP server is.
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a simple way to exchange files over
the internet. If a hacker got FTP access to my website, he could delete/upload
anything he wants on my server. An FTP address looks similar to a website
address except it uses the prefix ftp:// instead of http://. I set up an FTP server
on my computer so I could demonstrate. You can get Brutus at
http://www.hoobie.net/brutus/ .
1. First the hacker would choose a target. In this case it’s my home
computer and the IP address for your home computer is 127.0.0.1 .
2. By going to ftp://127.0.0.1 I get a pop-up box asking for a username and
password.
35
3. Next the hacker would launch a program similar to Brutus and attempt
to crack the password.
4. In the target you put the IP address of the website and to the right
select the appropriate option, which in this case is FTP.
5. The default port is 21 but some websites change this to make them a
little more secure. If you find out that the port isn’t 21, you can find the
right one by doing a port scan. We will get into this later in the book.
6. If you don’t know any of the usernames for the FTP server, then you will
have to get a list of the most common usernames.
7. For a dictionary attack you will have to choose the pass mode Word List
and browse and select the file containing your word list. You can get
some good password lists at
36
http://packetstormsecurity.org/Crackers/wordlists/ . Below are
examples of what a username and password list might look like.
8. Once you hit Start the program will attempt to connect to the server and
begin to try all the possible combinations from your lists.
9. If you’re lucky, eventually it’ll get the right Username:Password
combination. As you can see below, it got the correct combination of
username – admin and password – password.
37
10. A smarter hacker would use a proxy when using a program like this.
What a proxy does is cloaks your IP address by sending your connection
request through another computer before going to the target. This is a
smart idea because as you will see in the image below, Brutus leaves a
huge log of your presence on the target server.
38
11. In place of the IP address 127.0.0.1 would be the hackers IP address.
Footprints like these get a hacker caught and into a lot of trouble with
the law.
Brute-force Attacks
With time, brute-force attacks can crack any passwords. Brute-force attacks
try every possible combination of letters, numbers, and special characters until
the right password is found. Brute-force attacks can take a long time. The speed is
determined by the speed of the computer running the cracking program and the
complexity of the password. Below I will show you how Brutus can be used
against the same FTP server but this time using the brute-force option.
1. Put in the target and port the same way you did for the dictionary attack.
For the pass mode choose Brute-force and click range.
2. If you have an idea of what the password might be, then you can choose
the right option. For example if you know a site that requires your
password to be a certain length then you’ll know what to put down as a
39
minimum length thus narrowing down the end results and shortening the
cracking process.
3. I chose lowercase alpha which has the second smallest amount of
combinations. Even at second smallest it came up with 321, 272,407
possible password combinations. Now you know why it can take so long to
crack one password.
Rainbow Tables
A Rainbow table is a huge pre-computed list of hash values for every
possible combination of characters. A password hash is a password that has gone
through a mathematical algorithm that transformed it into something absolutely
foreign. A hash is a one way encryption so once a password is hashed there is no
way to get the original string from the hashed string. A very common hashing
algorithm used as security to store passwords in website databases is MD5.
Let’s say you are registering for a website. You put in a username and
password. Now when you submit, your password goes through the MD5
algorithm and the outcome hash is stored in a database. Now since you can’t get
the password from the hash, you may be wondering how they know if your
password is right when you login. Well when you login and submit your username
40
and password, a script takes your password and runs it through the md5
algorithm. The outcome hash is compared to the hash stored in the database. If
they are the same, you are admitted.
If I were to run the word “cheese” through the md5 algorithm, the
outcome would be fea0f1f6fede90bd0a925b4194deac11. Having huge tables of
every possible character combination hashed is a much better alternative to
brute-force cracking. Once the rainbow tables are created, cracking the password
is a hundred times faster than brute-forcing it. I will show an example of rainbow
table cracking when we get into Windows password cracking.
Phishing
Phishing is the process of stealing sensitive information, such as
usernames, passwords, and bank information, by pretending to be someone
you’re not. An example of this would be if you receive and e-mail from a hacker
pretending to be your bank. In this e-mail, it might tell you that you need to
update your account before it expires, and then the hacker provides a link. Once
you click on the link, you arrive at a website that looks exactly like your actual
bank page. In reality it’s just a perfect replica, and when you input your login
details, it sends it to the hackers email or stores it on his web server. Hackers that
create the best, most deceiving phishing web pages are knowledgeable in the
area of HTML and the PHP programming. Below I will show a simple example of
some of the steps a hacker might take to create a phishing website. By seeing the
steps a hacker would take, will help you defend against such an attack.
1. First the hacker chooses a target. The most popular targets for phishing
attacks are e-mail services such as Hotmail and Gmail because they are
the most common and once a hacker gets access to your e-mail, he also
gets access to a load of other user information for all the other websites
you use. In this example we will pretend the hacker chose Gmail as his
target.
2. After choosing his target, the hacker will go to the website and save the
whole main page. I use Mozilla Firefox ,(highly recommend using this
browser for its security and customization.) So I would go to
www.gmail.com and click File -> Save page as… , or simply hit  + S
41
which does this automatically. Choose where you would like to save the
web page and hit Save.
3. Once you have it saved, rename ServiceLogin.htm to index.htm. The
reason you want to name it “index” is so when you upload it to a web
host and someone goes to your link, the index page is the first page that
shows up.
4. Next the hacker would create a PHP script to do his dirty deed of
steeling your information. Below is a simple PHP script that logs and
stores your login details when you click “Sign in”. To see how it works,
copy and paste the following code into notepad. Next save it into the
same directory as you saved the Gmail page, and name it phish.php. In
addition to the phish.php page, create a new empty text file and name it
list.txt.
42
 $value) {
fwrite($handle, $variable);
fwrite($handle, “=”);
fwrite($handle, $value);
fwrite($handle, “\r\n”);
} // This section simply assigns all the information going through
this form to a variable. This includes your username and password.
Fwrite($handle, “\r\n”); // This writes your details to the file “list.txt”
fclose($handle); // This simply closes the connection to the file
“list.txt”
exit;
?> // Marks the end of the PHP program.
So far you should see the following in your folder:
43
5. Now the hacker would have to edit the main Gmail page to include his
PHP script. To see what the hacker would do, open up the main Gmail
page named index.htm with notepad.
6. Hit  + F , or go to Edit -> Find , type in action and hit “Find Next”.
7. This will highlight the first occurrence of the word “action” in the script
and you should see the following:
There are two “action” occurrences in the script so make sure you have
the right one by looking at the “form id” name above. Change the link
between action = “ “ to phish.php . This will make the form submit to
your PHP phish script instead of to Google. After the link you will see the
code:
Change the word “POST” to “GET” so that it looks like method=”GET”.
What the GET method does is submit the information you type in
through the URL so that the PHP script can log it.
8. Save and close the file.
9. Next the hacker would upload the files up to a free webhost that
supports PHP. With a simple Google search you can come up with a
bunch that fall under this category.
10. Once all the files are uploaded, you must give writing permissions to the
“list.txt” file. Every hosting company should have a CHMOD option next
to each file. Select this option and change the file permission for
“list.txt” to 777. If you can’t figure out how to do this, ask people that
use the same host or simply Google something similar to:
“yourwebhostname chmod”.
44
11. Once everything is up and ready to go, go to the link your host provided
you for your website and you should see the Gmail page replica. Type in
a username/password and click Sign in. This should have redirected you
to the real Gmail page.
12. Now go take a look at your list.txt file by going through your hosting file
manager or going to
http://www.yourwebhosturl.com/youraccount/list.txt. Although this is
the most common, the web host you use may provide a different
looking URL. Now if I put a username of “myusername” and a password
of “mypassword” then “list.txt” would now look like the following:
As you can see if you fell for this the hacker would have your email and
password. Scary, eh?
Countermeasures
I will now show you all the countermeasures you should take to
protect yourself from all of the password cracking attacks talked about
in this chapter.
Social Engineering
To protect yourself from social engineering attacks like the one
discussed in this chapter you must learn to question the possible
attacker. If you get a phone call from someone, and you think that there
may be a chance that the person isn’t who he says he is, then ask him
some questions that he should be able to answer to establish his
