**Issue with FreeCodeCamp Challenge: "Waypoint - Comment Your JavaScript Code"**

I encountered an issue while attempting the challenge at [http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-comment-your-javascript-code](http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-comment-your-javascript-code).

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to the challenge using the provided link.
2. Enter comments into the code editor as instructed by the challenge.
3. Observe the left panel, which displays an error message.

**Description:**
- After adding my comments to the code, the left panel indicated that there was an error in my code.
- I have reviewed my code and cannot identify any issues.
- This is also the first time that the left panel has provided a specific reason for a code error; in previous lessons, no such explanations were given for any errors in the code editor.

**Screenshots:**
