Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-comment-your-javascript-
code has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links to
screenshots if possible.  
I entered my comments into the code editor, however, the left panel is
responding by pretty much telling me my code has an error. I don't see
anything wrong with my line of code, and this is also the first time that the
left panel has said why my code is incorrect, which I've noticed that it never
had mentioned reasons for any of my code errors in my code editor in the
previous lessons.
