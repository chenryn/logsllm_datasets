User: Please introduce the basic working principle of the HTTP protocol, how to make requests and responses, and what are the HTTP status codes?
Assistant: The HTTP protocol is an application layer protocol used for data communication between clients and servers. It is based on a request-response model, where the client sends a request and the server returns a response. HTTP uses the TCP protocol as the transmission protocol, and uses the reliable data transmission and flow control provided by the transmission control protocol to ensure the reliability of the data. An HTTP request includes three parts: request line, request header, and request body. The request line includes the request method (GET, POST, etc.), the request URI, and the HTTP protocol version number; the request header includes some additional information, such as User-Agent, Cookie, etc.; the request body contains data content. The HTTP response includes three parts: status line, response header, and response body. The status line includes the protocol version number, status code, and status information; the response header includes additional information about the response, such as Content-type, Cookie, etc.; the response body includes the data content returned by the server. HTTP status codes are used to indicate the results returned by the server, and are mainly divided into the following five categories: 1xx: Informational status codes, indicating that the request has been accepted or is being processed. 2xx: Success status code, indicating that the request has been successfully processed. 3xx: Redirection status code, indicating that further operations are required to complete the request. 4xx: Client error status code, indicating that the client request is wrong or cannot complete the request. 5xx: Server error status code, indicating that the server could not complete the request or an error occurred. Common status codes include 200 OK (successful request), 404 Not Found (requested resource does not exist), 500 Internal Server Error (internal server error), etc. In general, the HTTP protocol is a simple, flexible and extensible protocol. Its basic working principle is to communicate data through the request-response model, and use the reliable data transmission and flow control provided by the TCP protocol to ensure data reliability. At the same time, the HTTP status code is used to indicate the result returned by the server, which is convenient for the client to process.
