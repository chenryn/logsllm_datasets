User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Azure Ubuntu VM is completely unresponsive after security patches and restart I have an Azure VM where I host a number of websites. Recently, I logged in and it needed some security updates so according to this link (https://askubuntu.com/questions/196768/how-to-install-updates-via-command-line), I ran this script.

sudo apt-get update  &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dost-upgrade


It did its thing, installing patches and then asked me to restart my VM. After I did that, I now can no longer ssh into it, I can't access the web applications and I can't ping it.

I've tried restarting the VM in the Azure portal and although the status is Running, and Azure thinks the VM is working, the VM is completely unresponsive. 

I have a feeling maybe the patches corrupted the VM itself. But I have no way to tell because I can't connect to it to see what's going on and I can't even access any logs.

What can I do in this situation?

Assistant: If your VM is a V2, the boot diagnostics may help to find the problem:
