It appears that insert().from_select(), when passed a CTE, doesn't generate
syntactically valid MS SQL code. The code it generates (using the recursive
"parts" example in the CTE documentation) looks like:
    INSERT INTO destination (part, sub_part, quantity) WITH anon_1(part, sub_part, quantity) AS 
    (SELECT parts.sub_part AS sub_part, parts.part AS part, parts.quantity AS quantity 
    FROM parts 
    WHERE parts.part = ? UNION ALL SELECT parts_1.sub_part AS sub_part, parts_1.part AS part, parts_1.quantity AS quantity 
    FROM parts AS parts_1, anon_1 AS anon_2 
    WHERE parts_1.part = anon_2.sub_part)
     SELECT anon_1.part, anon_1.sub_part, anon_1.quantity 
    FROM anon_1
But SQL Server requires the INSERT below the CTE definition, as below:
    WITH anon_1(part, sub_part, quantity) AS 
    (SELECT parts.sub_part AS sub_part, parts.part AS part, parts.quantity AS quantity 
    FROM parts 
    WHERE parts.part = ? UNION ALL SELECT parts_1.sub_part AS sub_part, parts_1.part AS part, parts_1.quantity AS quantity 
    FROM parts AS parts_1, anon_1 AS anon_2 
    WHERE parts_1.part = anon_2.sub_part)
    INSERT INTO destination (part, sub_part, quantity)
     SELECT anon_1.part, anon_1.sub_part, anon_1.quantity 
    FROM anon_1
