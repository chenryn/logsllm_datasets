    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    1.Create a http.Client object, and Get() a web page containing javascript. The specific
    page I am using is http://www.stedwards.edu
    2.Create a html.Tokenizer, walk through the html with Tokenizer.Next(), print out errors
    when html.ErrorToken is found.
    What is the expected output?
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    I expect the html.Tokenizer to skip javascript (or at least getting walk through the
    javascript without blowing up) when calling the Next() function.
    What do you see instead?
    ------------------------------------------------
    The error produced is:
    html: TODO(nigeltao): handle malformed tags
    The javascript to blame is:
    if ((screen.width<1025) && (screen.height<769))
    {
    The less than symbol in "screen.width<", is causing the tokenizer to blow
    up.
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    -------------------------------------------------
    6g
    Which operating system are you using?
    ------------------------------------------------
    debian 6
    Which revision are you using?  (hg identify)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    c5c62aeb6267 release/release.r56/weekly.2011-03-07.1
    Please provide any additional information below.
    ------------------------------------------------
    Should html.Tokenizer really be trying to parse javascript? I personally think anything
    between  should be skipped.
    I have attached the program I am using (just in case it is needed). Please let me know
    if there is anything I can do to help. I am interested in becoming more part of this
    project (I have even considered attempting to fix the problem myself). Thanks.
