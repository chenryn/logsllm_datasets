Question: "Consider a symmetric block cipher used in secure communications. Which of the following statements accurately reflect the properties and functions of a block cipher in the context of encryption and decryption? (Select all that apply)"
 "A": "The block cipher must be nondeterministic to ensure that the same plaintext input does not produce the same ciphertext output when encrypted with the same key."
 "B": "The block cipher must be a permutation on the n-bit strings, which implies that it is an invertible function to allow for decryption."
 "C": "A block cipher's security is solely determined by the length of the key, with longer keys always guaranteeing stronger security regardless of other factors."
 "D": "The block cipher uses a fixed-length key to select from a set of scrambling settings, ensuring that without the key, an attacker should not be able to decrypt the ciphertext."
