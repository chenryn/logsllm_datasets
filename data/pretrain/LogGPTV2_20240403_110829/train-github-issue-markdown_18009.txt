Is there any reason for this behaviour? I used this trick
https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/blob/db7a5d61730ad72857ae355597838b3d77f5bc28/src/utils/log.js#L21
and suddenly realised it doesn't work because of the issue. I managed to solve
it by switching to a similar technique (unused variable), but this still looks
like an inconsistency.
