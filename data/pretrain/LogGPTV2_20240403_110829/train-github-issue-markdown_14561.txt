There appears to be an issue with the challenge located at <http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-bring-your-javascript-slot-machine-to-life>. To reproduce this problem, please follow these steps:

1. Open the challenge in your web browser.
2. In the code editor, use single quotes (') instead of double quotes (") for any string values or attributes.
3. Observe that the code does not function as expected when using single quotes.

For a visual representation of the issue, please refer to the following screenshots:

According to my understanding, the choice between single and double quotes should not affect the functionality of the code. However, in this case, the use of single quotes results in unexpected behavior, while double quotes work correctly.
