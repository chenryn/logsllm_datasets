# Introduction to Zero Trust Deployment

## Assess Zero Trust Readiness and Build a Plan

In today's complex and mobile environment, organizations need a new security model that can adapt to modern challenges, support a mobile workforce, and protect people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located. This is the essence of **Zero Trust**. Unlike traditional models that assume everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes a breach and verifies each request as if it originated from an untrusted network. The principle is simple: "never trust, always verify."

## Guiding Principles of Zero Trust

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Verify Explicitly** | Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. |
| **Use Least Privilege Access** | Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection. |
| **Assume Breach** | Minimize the blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to gain visibility, detect threats, and improve defenses. |

A Zero Trust approach should be applied across the entire digital estate, serving as an integrated security philosophy and end-to-end strategy. This is achieved by implementing Zero Trust controls and technologies across six foundational elements. Each element is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.

Different organizational requirements, existing technology implementations, and security stages all influence how a Zero Trust security model is implemented. Based on our experience in helping customers secure their organizations and implementing our own Zero Trust model, we have developed the following guidance to assess your readiness and help you build a plan to achieve Zero Trust.

### Follow These Steps to Mature Your Organization's Security Approach and Optimize Zero Trust Implementation:

1. **Secure Identity with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTIdentity)
   - Identities—whether they represent people, services, or IoT devices—define the Zero Trust control plane. When an identity attempts to access a resource, verify that identity with strong authentication and ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity. Follow least privilege access principles.

2. **Secure Endpoints with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTDevices)
   - Once an identity has been granted access to a resource, data can flow to a variety of different endpoints, including IoT devices, smartphones, BYOD, partner-managed devices, and cloud-hosted servers. Monitor and enforce device health and compliance for secure access.

3. **Secure Applications with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTApplications)
   - Applications and APIs provide the interface by which data is consumed. They may be legacy on-premises, lifted-and-shifted to cloud workloads, or modern SaaS applications. Apply controls and technologies to discover shadow IT, ensure appropriate in-app permissions, gate access based on real-time analytics, monitor for abnormal behavior, control user actions, and validate secure configuration options.

4. **Secure Data with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTData)
   - Ultimately, security teams are protecting data. Where possible, data should remain safe even if it leaves the devices, apps, infrastructure, and networks the organization controls. Classify, label, and encrypt data, and restrict access based on those attributes.

5. **Secure Infrastructure with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTInfrastructure)
   - Infrastructure—whether on-premises servers, cloud-based VMs, containers, or microservices—represents a critical threat vector. Assess for version, configuration, and JIT access to harden defense. Use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies, and automatically block and flag risky behavior and take protective actions.

6. **Secure Networks with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTNetwork)
   - All data is ultimately accessed over network infrastructure. Networking controls can provide critical controls to enhance visibility and help prevent attackers from moving laterally across the network. Segment networks (and do deeper in-network micro-segmentation) and deploy real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics.

7. **Visibility, Automation, and Orchestration with Zero Trust** — [Learn More](https://aka.ms/ZTCrossPillars)
   - In our Zero Trust guides, we define the approach to implement an end-to-end Zero Trust methodology across identities, endpoints and devices, data, apps, infrastructure, and network. These activities increase your visibility, which gives you better data for making trust decisions. With each of these individual areas generating their own relevant alerts, an integrated capability to manage the resulting influx of data is essential to better defend against threats and validate trust in transactions.

With Zero Trust, we move away from a trust-by-default perspective to a trust-by-exception one. An integrated capability to automatically manage those exceptions and alerts is crucial so you can more easily find and detect threats, respond to them, and prevent or block undesired events across your organization.
