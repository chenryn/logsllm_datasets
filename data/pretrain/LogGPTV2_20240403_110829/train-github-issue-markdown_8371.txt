Hi everyone,
I thought this was addressed in #2797, but it didn't. It might be a duplicate
of #174.
## The problem
In short, copying + pasting is very weird with newlines. In some cases, it
seems to copy only _some_ of them:

But using `clear` in the WSL seems to reliably and effectively completely
break copying.

It doesn't copy any whitespaces, instead, it copies the buffer as-is.
The same effect seems to occur with PowerShell. Here without a `clear`
beforehand:

And here with a clear beforehand:

## System info
The selected console is a standard WSL Ubuntu, as detected by the terminal:
        {
          "guid": "{2c4de342-38b7-51cf-b940-2309a097f518}",
          "hidden": false,
          "name": "Ubuntu",
          "source": "Windows.Terminal.Wsl"
        }
If it's a powershell, it's similar:
        {
          // Make changes here to the powershell.exe profile
          "guid": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
          "name": "Windows PowerShell",
          "commandline": "powershell.exe",
          "hidden": false
        },
Nothing in the config has been changed, besides adding two (unrelated)
profiles. In the screenshot, the Windows Terminal was freshly opened.
