### What:
When a user specifies multiple chunks as output report a numeric statistic
about the amount of bundle duplication across chunks.
For example:
    *chunks*
      * 124124.js ~ 10% duplication
      * 213412.js ~ 50% duplication
      * 545634.js ~ 25% duplication
    run build -- -bundle-stats-viz to explore duplication
### Why:
When multiple chunks are output the volume of duplication is non-obvious and
actually quite hard to know without using external tools. (see this post to
understand the full implications http://www.susielu.com/data-viz/bundle-buddy)
Since this "duplication" number is critical to ensuring good bundle chunk
settings these values should be reported to the user so that they can better
tweak their splitting process to minimize duplicaiton.

### How:
The current approach used in bundle buddy uses source maps to build up a
mapping of source lines to final bundle outputs, reusing this code should be
possible if we keep using source maps as the backing data store.
