More brainstorming from training session in LA, 5/1/08 with Chris Beams,
Tchavdar Ivanov (FIM) and myself.
`@Validator` could be a class level annotation eligible for component scans,
the methods of which could be annotated with `@Validate` (or similar) which
would enable method/request param specific validation within the request
handling workflow
  * Like the `@HandlerInterceptor` design (#9447) `@Validator` could take a list of `@Controller` classes for a more fine grained approach or `@Controller` could take a list of `@Validator` which would match the current register model (I think I like the later)
`@Validate` would define a method used to validate an `@RequestParam`, it'd
might be neat if it handled superset of `@RequestParam` and `@RequestMapping`
arguments for a very fine grained approach, i.e. `@Validate`("reward",
method=RequestMethod.POST).
  * Another option would be to register the Validator with the `@RequestParam`
Hope you dig the ideas

  * #4803 Support for declarative validation (Hibernate Validator, anticipating JSR 303)
  * #14072 Improve support for registering Validator implementations in Spring MVC ( _ **"is superseded by"**_ )
