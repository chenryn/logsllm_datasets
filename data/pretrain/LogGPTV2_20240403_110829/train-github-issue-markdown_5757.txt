# Environment
    Windows build number: 18363.418
    Windows Terminal version: 0.5.2762.0
If a profile is defined with an invalid commandline, or if the shell specified
has been uninstalled by the user, trying to open a tab with that profile will
not show any warning about the failure to launch the shell process.
If the profile is defined with "closeOnExit":false, the tab will wait forever
for the shell to get connected instead of showing an error message. If the
profile is defined with "closeOnExit":true, the tab will immediately close
with no explanation.
# Steps to reproduce
Create a profile with a non-existing shell such as the following:  
{  
// A non-existing shell  
"guid": "{0225F6B6-EC1C-4746-8384-A83DB214D13A}",  
"closeOnExit": false,  
"name": "dummy",  
"commandline": "dummyshell.exe",  
"hidden": false  
},
# Expected behavior
If the commandline cannot be launched, an error should notify the user that
the process couldn't be created, so they know they have to look at the command
line more closely.
# Actual behavior
Instead of some error message, Windows Terminal keeps the tab open and cursor
waiting with no hint that something went wrong launching the shell, or simply
silently closes the tab if "closeOnExit":true.
