I am unsure if this issue has been resolved in the master branch, but it persists in version 0.4.3. The following code snippet reproduces the error:

```julia
function ff()
    gg(x, y) = 1.0 * (x == y)
    xx = [(i, i) for i in 1:2]
    yy = xx'
    broadcast(gg, xx, yy)
end

ff()
```

When running this code, the following error is encountered:

```
ERROR: LoadError: MethodError: `convert` has no method matching convert(::Type{Tuple{Int64,Int64}}, ::Float64)
```
