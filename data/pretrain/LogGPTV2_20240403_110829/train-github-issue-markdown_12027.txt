Hi, I'm trying to make my app in production on Google App Engine but this
error occur :  
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined`
When I check where the problem is I find :  
`window.__NEXT_LOADED_CHUNKS__.forEach`
Everything is ok on dev.  
You can check the live app here : https://www.chefing.fr
Here is my Dockerfile:
    FROM node:6.5 
    RUN mkdir -p /app 
    WORKDIR /app
    ADD package.json /app/
    COPY . /app/
    RUN npm i
    RUN npm i -g nodemon
    RUN npm i -g next
    RUN npm i -g react
    RUN npm i -g react-dom
    RUN next build
    RUN echo $GAE_VERSION > .next/BUILD_ID
    ENV NODE_ENV=production
    EXPOSE 3000
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD [ "npm", "run", "start" ]
Everything is ok with the deployement, push / pull, deployement, start etc...
No error.  
And this is my next.config.js file (In case of problem).
    module.exports = {
      webpack: function (c) {
        if (c.resolve.alias) {
          delete c.resolve.alias['react']
          delete c.resolve.alias['react-dom']
        }
        return c
      }
    }
I hope you can help us :)  
Thanks, Steve.
