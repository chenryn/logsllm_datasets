Subject: Issue with `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined` in Google App Engine Production

---

Hello,

I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate. I am currently facing an issue while deploying my application to Google App Engine, where the following error occurs:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined
```

Upon further investigation, I found that the problem originates from the following line of code:
```javascript
window.__NEXT_LOADED_CHUNKS__.forEach
```

The application works perfectly fine in the development environment. You can view the live app [here](https://www.chefing.fr).

### Dockerfile
Here is the Dockerfile I am using for deployment:

```dockerfile
FROM node:6.5
RUN mkdir -p /app
WORKDIR /app
ADD package.json /app/
COPY . /app/
RUN npm i
RUN npm i -g nodemon
RUN npm i -g next
RUN npm i -g react
RUN npm i -g react-dom
RUN next build
RUN echo $GAE_VERSION > .next/BUILD_ID
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 3000
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "run", "start" ]
```

The deployment process (push, pull, and start) completes without any errors.

### next.config.js
Additionally, here is my `next.config.js` file, which might be relevant to the issue:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  webpack: function (config) {
    if (config.resolve.alias) {
      delete config.resolve.alias['react'];
      delete config.resolve.alias['react-dom'];
    }
    return config;
  }
};
```

### Environment
- **Next.js**: 2.4.7
- **Node.js**: 6.5
- **MobX**: 3.2

I hope you can help me resolve this issue. Thank you in advance!

Best regards,
Steve
