User: When I enter in python in Terminal it loads up Python 2.6.2. However there are folders by the name of Python 2.6 in different places on my drive. I'm not sure if that's because Python 2.6 has been installed in different places or because Python just likes to have lots of folers in different places.
If there are multiple installations, I could really do with being able to set which one should be used.
Assistant: When you run python in a shell or command prompt it will execute the first executable file which is found in your PATH environment variable.
To find out what file is being executed use which python or where python.
