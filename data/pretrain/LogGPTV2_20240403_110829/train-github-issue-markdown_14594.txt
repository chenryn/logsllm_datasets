When attempting to add a watch, I encountered a crash with the following error message:

**Assertion failed: `object->InternalFieldCount() > 0`  
File: `d:\jenkins\workspace\nodejs-msi-julien\d8c2e2bb\src\util-inl.h`  
Line: 117**

**Version:** 0.10.10  
**Commit:** `5b5f4db`

This indicates that the object being watched does not have any internal fields, which is causing the assertion to fail. Could you please provide more context or steps to reproduce this issue?
