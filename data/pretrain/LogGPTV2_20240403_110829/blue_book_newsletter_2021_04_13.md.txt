## New: Sketch How to Automate Repetitive Tasks Prompted by Email Events
Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated. I recently discovered [notmuchmail](https://notmuchmail.org/), which appears very promising. A friend recommended using [afew](https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tagging, and I plan to use [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) to interact with the system, enabling me to manage email from the command line.

## Improvement: Add Interesting Interface
For the interface, [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks impressive. It is inspired by Andrew Louis' talk, [Building a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s), and his [blog posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seem to be a valuable resource. Additionally, [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi) is worth exploring.

## New: Sketch How to Improve the Launching of Applications with i3wm
In the past, I attempted to install [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) without success, but I should try again. If the default features are insufficient, I will explore [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

# Coding

## Python

### Plugin System
* **New:** Add Beets System as a First Approach
  When developing Python applications, it is beneficial to build the core of your program and allow for extensions via plugins. Although I am still learning how to implement this, the [Beets plugin system](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/plugins.html) seems like an excellent starting point.

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### Hushboard
* **New:** Introduce Hushboard
  [Hushboard](https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/) is a utility that mutes your microphone while you are typing. (Thanks to [M0wer](https://m0wer.github.io/memento/computer_science/gnu_linux/hushboard/) for the recommendation!)
