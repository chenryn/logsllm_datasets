for ϕ1(z) as well. In the experiments the slightly less optimal
approximation ˆξ(z) is used for simplicity.
V. CASE STUDIES
This section introduces two case studies, to illustrate the
dependencies discussed in Section II-C and allow performance
evaluation of the method presented in Section IV. Despite the
apparent simplicity, the corresponding models include aspects
that may lead to a variable size7 and stiffness [4]–[6], and thus
the proposed method is actually tested to compute ˆM under
unfavorable conditions.
A. Case study 1: degradable system
Consider a fault tolerant degradable system with nr compo-
nents inspired to that presented in [28]. The failure time of each
component is exponentially distributed with parameter λ. The
system is equipped with features to detect and recover from
failures during normal system operation, which are successful
with probability cf (coverage parameter), leading to a degraded
state where the failed component is recovered at a constant
rate μ. Otherwise, with probability 1 − cf , the recovery of the
component fails leaving the system in a state, labeled 0, in
which all nr components are temporarily non-operational, but
the system has not yet failed, being still able to provide a basic
service by default. The system is also equipped with features to
detect and recover from state 0. Therefore it is recovered from
state 0 with probability cr at a constant rate μd. Otherwise,
with probability 1 − cr, the overall system fails permanently
(state 0f ): all components are considered no longer operational
and no default degraded service can be delivered.
The CTMC representing this system is depicted in Figure 3,
where each state i ≥ 0 represents the number i of currently
operational components.
The parameters deﬁned in Case study 1 are θ1 := λ, θ2 :=
cf , θ3 := cr and θ4 := μd. Based on the number p of
parameters actually considered 3 different sub-cases are deﬁned:

Case study 1a, Case study 1b and Case study 1c, with p equal
to 2, 3 and 4, respectively (and all the other parameters, beyond
the ﬁrst p, considered as constant numerical values).
The following two measures of interest have been analyzed:
Reliability: probability that the system is operational at time t
given that it is operational at time 0, formally deﬁned as
m(t, θ) :=E[ V (t, θ)], where V is given in Equation (3)
with reward structure

if s (cid:11)= 0f ,
otherwise.
Under repair: percentage of time during which at least one
component is operational and at least one component is
under repair. It is evaluated as the mean percentage of
sojourn time the model spends in nr − 1, . . . , 1 in the
interval [0, t], i.e., time-averaged [3] accumulated measure
formally deﬁned by m(t, θ) :=E[ Y (t, θ)]/t, where Y is

Fig. 5. Case study 2: Semi-Markov chain for system with UPS with
limited battery life. Rounded and non-rounded rectangles represent states with
exponential and non-exponential respectively sojourn times. Each transient
state is a tuple that contains: the number of battery destructive discharge cycles
completed, the state of the power supply (up or down), and the battery charge
level (greater than 15% or between 0 and 15%). Absorbing states are labeled
with: life cycle number and F (system failure). Each arc is labeled with the
probability distribution from which the transition time is drawn.
In order to solve the model, it is converted into a CTMC,
approximating the [100%, 85%) and (15%, 0%) discharge
times with Erlang distributions comprising ne,1 and ne,2
exponential transitions, respectively.

VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The aim of this section is to compare the performance of
the approach presented in Section IV. Two alternatives are
considered for the computation of the solution bundle: the
Full Tensor and the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). To
concretely show an example of the computed measures bundle,
results of sensitivity analysis applied to selected measures of
the two case studies are brieﬂy shown.
A. Comparison with the full tensor evaluation alternative
The comparison with the full tensor M evaluation when high
accuracy of the measures is required focuses on the deﬁnition
of ˆM as in Equation (8) (that is the precursor to obtain ˆm as
Equation (6)).
In all the experiments, the mission time is set to 10 years,
corresponding to tmax = 24 · 365 · 10 hours, and the ACA

assignments, leads to stiff models [11]. The performance of
the approach as the state-space dimension N increases is not
reported, even though it has been veriﬁed that, as expected, the
speedups reported in Tables I and II remain almost the same
at increasing of N. To summarize the results: speedups of the
proposed approach with respect to the full evaluation of the
tensor in both case studies are relevant, and grow at increasing
of points number n0 · n1 · n2, maintaining great accuracy.

The computer where the experiments were performed has a
11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 CPU, 4 unit clocked
at 2.80GHz, 8 treads, 40Gb of DDR4 RAM clocked at
3200MHz. The operating system is Pop! OS 20.04 LTS. The
implementation of the solution method has been written in
MATLAB [29] and is freely available8. Memory consumption
for each run of Case 1 and 2 has been between 4 and 6 Gb.
The parameters are those detailed in Section V. The
parameters’ assignment (rates are expressed in hour−1) for
Case study 1a is: μ = μd = 0.5, cr = 0.9, θ1 := λ ∈
−5], θ2 := cf ∈ [0.9, 0.99]. For Case study 1b,
[10
θ3 := cr ∈ [0.9, 0.99], and, for Case study 1c, θ4 := μd ∈
[0.25, 0.75]. Speedup and accuracy are reported in Table I
for Reliability and Under repair, where it can be appreciated
that the proposed approach requires few seconds to about
106 points (more precisely: n0 · n1 · n2 = 1003, for Case
study 1a; n0 · n1 · n2 · n3 = 324, for Case study 1b; and
n0 · n1 · n2 · n3 · n4 = 165, for Case study 1c), whereas the full
evaluation of M require hundreds of seconds, and the accuracy

It is also interesting to notice that for the approximation ˆM a
really small fraction of points (k instead of 106) are needed,
and that the adaptive choice of pivots described in Section IV-C
