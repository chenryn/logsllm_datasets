## Problem Description
In the most recent alpha with the most recent release of normalize.css
(4.0.0), EnhancedButtons are styled like actual buttons.

After doing some digging, the problem is with recent changes in both projects.
In material-ui, commit `00b6ba1` added passing the type attribute to the inner
element, and in normalize.css a recent commit lowered the specificity of a
rule giving any element with `[type=button]` `-webkit-appearance: button`.
I've already opened an issue in their project but because type is not a valid
attribute for span and because lowering the specificity is slightly more
performant, they don't seem to keen on reverting those changes.
