User: I have python 3.1 installed, and I have added it to the system path too. Now I can open "cmd" and type python to start python, but whenever I try to open cmd in a specific directory by using (shift + right click -> open command prompt here), and type python, it says "command not found"! 
How can I fix this?
Assistant: Right click on my computer>got to properties>advanced settings>environmental variables>

choose path and add the installed python dirtory to that path as like below:

C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\Python27
