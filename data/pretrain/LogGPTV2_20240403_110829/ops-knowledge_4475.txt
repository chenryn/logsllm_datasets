User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Ingestion monitoring, metrics, and errors:
Where can I view insights about ingestion?

n
Assistant: You can use the portal's [Azure Monitor Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to help you understand how Azure Data Explorer is performing and how it's being used.
The Insight view is based on [metrics](../../using-metrics.md) and [diagnostic logs](../../using-diagnostic-logs.md) that can be streamed to a Log Analytics workspace. 
Use the [.dup-next-ingest](dup-next-ingest.md) command to duplicate the next ingestion into a storage container and review the details and metadata of the ingestion.
