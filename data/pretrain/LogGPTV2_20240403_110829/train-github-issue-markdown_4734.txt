### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the Playwright test UI:
   ```sh
   npx playwright test --ui
   ```
2. Attempt to run the only existing test in the repository (click the play button on the single test).
3. Observe the following errors in the console:
   ```
   Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_createTestResult')
       at Be._onTestBegin (http://localhost:58924/trace/watch.575ca3b3.js:1:3028)
       at Be.dispatch (http://localhost:58924/trace/watch.575ca3b3.js:1:1991)
       at window.dispatch (http://localhost:58924/trace/watch.575ca3b3.js:3:296)
       at eval (eval at evaluate (:195:30), :2:10)
       at UtilityScript.evaluate (:197:17)
       at UtilityScript. (:1:44)

   Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'resultsMap')
       at Be._onStepBegin (http://localhost:58924/trace/watch.575ca3b3.js:1:3534)
       at Be.dispatch (http://localhost:58924/trace/watch.575ca3b3.js:1:2119)
       at window.dispatch (http://localhost:58924/trace/watch.575ca3b3.js:3:296)
       at eval (eval at evaluate (:195:30), :2:10)
       at UtilityScript.evaluate (:197:17)
       at UtilityScript. (:1:44)
   // etc...
   ```

4. Run the tests without the UI:
   ```sh
   npx playwright test
   ```
5. Notice that the tests run 5 times as expected and pass.

### Expected Behavior
- The test should run successfully in the Playwright test UI.

### Actual Behavior
- The test does not run, and errors appear in the console.
