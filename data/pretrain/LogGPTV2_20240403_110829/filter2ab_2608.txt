### ATT&CK Technique: User Account Control (ID: M1052)

#### Configuration of UAC Privilege Elevation for Standard Users

To disable User Account Control (UAC) privilege elevation for standard users, modify the following registry key:

- **Registry Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
- **Value to Add:**
  - **Name:** `ConsentPromptBehaviorUser`
  - **Type:** `DWORD`
  - **Data:** `0x00000000`

This setting will automatically deny elevation requests for standard users.

#### Enabling Installer Detection

To enable installer detection for all users, add the following value to the same registry path:

- **Name:** `EnableInstallerDetection`
- **Type:** `DWORD`
- **Data:** `0x00000001`

Enabling this setting will prompt for a password during installation and log the attempt. This can help in monitoring and controlling the installation process.

#### Disabling Installer Detection

If you choose to disable installer detection, set the `EnableInstallerDetection` value to:

- **Data:** `0x00000000`

Disabling installer detection may prevent potential privilege escalation through exploitation during the UAC detection process. However, it will allow the installation process to continue without being logged, which could reduce the visibility of such activities.

**Note:** Modifying these settings can have security implications. It is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between security and usability before making changes.
