**Title: Botconf 2020: The Dark Industry's Financial Exploitation Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic**

During the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China, people voluntarily isolated themselves at home to combat the virus. As a result, internet application traffic surged, with many individuals turning to apps like TikTok for entertainment and communication. In this context, cyber attackers exploited the situation by targeting home gateways. They used zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise over three million Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to home networks. Additionally, they employed HTTP hijacking to inject advertising pages into users' web browsing sessions.

This presentation will provide a brief overview of the vulnerability's underlying principles, with a particular focus on the malware utilized by the attackers and its functionalities. We will also demonstrate the techniques employed by the attackers to insert advertisements into web pages.
