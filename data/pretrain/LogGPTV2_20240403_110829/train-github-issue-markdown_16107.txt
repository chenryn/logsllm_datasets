by **PI:EMAIL** :
    I found a few issues with "Codelab: Writing Web Applications":
    In section "Handling non-existant pages," the function signature includes a
    third parameter, "title string" which is not introduced until later in the
    last section.  This may be confusing to some readers.
    In section "Template caching," the code snippet for the init() function is not
    in blockquote source code formatting.
    In section "Validation," the code block for constructing the regular
    expression is empty.  I think it is supposed to read:
    """
    var titleValidator regexp.Regexp = regexp.MustCompile("^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$")
    """
    but there currently is nothing in the  tag for that line.
    Also, this is not an error, but it would be circumspect if you could give an example URL
    that would be dangerous in the "Validation" section.  When I tried to do
    something nasty like "http://localhost:8080/view/../../../etc/passwd" or
    similar, the URL was automatically rewritten to remove all '../' and preceding
    directories.  I suppose this is a part of the URL parsing in the http package?  I was
    able to form an attack only by creating more files underneath my tree (or soft-linking
    my home directory from the go-wiki directory), and even then only when the extension
    matched the one used for wiki content (which I had changed to .wiki early on).  Even if
    this is the extent of that possible attack, I agree that it's a good idea to mention it,
    I just think a more specific example might be worthwhile.
    Great tutorial, thanks for providing it!
