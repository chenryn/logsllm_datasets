In the Electron repository, there are several documents translated into various languages by contributors. We greatly appreciate their efforts. These translations are valuable resources for beginners who are native speakers of those languages. However, these translated documents often become outdated as the project evolves, with new features and changes being added regularly. Currently, we only maintain and update the official English documentation.

To ensure that all translated documents remain up-to-date, I believe we need to develop a strategy. I have initiated a discussion on this topic and invite your thoughts and suggestions.
