In Electron's repo, there are some kinds of other foreign languages' documents
translated by some contributors(Thanks all for them).
It's quite nice for the native beginner, but there is an out-of-date issue of
them. As the project developed, many new-added features and changes will cause
the document updated. Right now we only keep the official document(English)
updated.
I think we should figure out a way to keep all the translated document
updated. I post a discussion here.
