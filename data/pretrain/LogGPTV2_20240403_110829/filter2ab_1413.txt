ATT&CK ID:M0809
ATT&CK Technique Name:Operational Information Confidentiality
Example mitigations could include minimizing its distribution/storage or obfuscating the information (e.g., facility coverterms, codenames).  In many cases this information may be necessary to support critical engineering, maintenance, or operational functions, therefore, it may not be feasible to implement.
