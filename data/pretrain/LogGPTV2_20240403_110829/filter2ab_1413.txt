**ATT&CK ID:** M0809  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operational Information Confidentiality

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Minimize Distribution and Storage:** Limit the dissemination and storage of sensitive operational information to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Use obfuscation methods, such as facility cover terms and codenames, to protect the confidentiality of the information.

**Considerations:**
- In many cases, this information may be essential for critical engineering, maintenance, or operational functions. Therefore, implementing these mitigations may not always be feasible. Organizations should carefully balance the need for security with the operational requirements.
