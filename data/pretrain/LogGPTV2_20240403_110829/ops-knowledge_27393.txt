User: How do I know is there my child process got hang while operating?
Assistant: I guess, you are asking, how do you find if the child process is hung while operating. You can't tell easily. A process could be doing a long running operation. The context is important to understand when a process is hung.
If you are expecting a process to respond to a user input and is not responsive for a long period then we consider it hung. Process is running probably waiting for some thing that will never happen. "Hung Process" is humanly way of saying that a program has reached a dead end and will be no more useful.
You could have a program calculating prime numbers one after another and can run for eons and can not be called a hung process.
