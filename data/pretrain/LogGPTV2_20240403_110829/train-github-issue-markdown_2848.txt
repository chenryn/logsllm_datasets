I have recently updated the definitions from version 0.0.33 to the latest version, 0.0.36. However, my build is failing with the following error, which also appears in versions 0.0.34 and 0.0.35:

```
.../node_modules/@types/google-apps-script/google-apps-script.base.d.ts
Type error: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.  Variable 'console' must be of type 'Console', but here has type 'console'.  TS2403

    325 | // declare var MimeType: GoogleAppsScript.Base.MimeType;
    326 | declare var Session: GoogleAppsScript.Base.Session;
  > 327 | declare var console: GoogleAppsScript.Base.console;
```

- **TypeScript Version:** 3.0.1
- **Authors:** @motemen, @grant

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?
