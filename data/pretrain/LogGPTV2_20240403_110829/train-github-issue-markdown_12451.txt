**Current behavior**
When binding the required attribute on an input tag, angular2 applies the
required validator through the RequiredValidator directive even if the
supplied expression evaluates to false.
**Expected/desired behavior**
The validator is not added or checks the supplied expression before
validation.
**Reproduction of the problem**
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    @Component({
        selector: 'demo-bug',
        template: `
          {{spy.className}}
        `
    })
    export class BugComponent {
        value: string;
        isRequired = false;
        constructor() { }
    }
