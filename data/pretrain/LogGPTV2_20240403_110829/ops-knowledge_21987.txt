User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What information can my ISP see when I visit a website? For example, when I enter this URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=example or http://www.google.com/search?q=example I can see the word example that I was searching on Google.
Can the ISP see this URL and so maybe register it in their logs?

Assistant: The ISP 


can see GET and POST Parameters of websites that don't use SSL
can see DNS requests (-> which domains did you visit)


So in your example the ISP would not see the search request as GET Parameters are encrypted with SSL (ref).

Conclusion: the ISP would know THAT you searched on Google but it wouldn't know WHAT you searched for.
