`kubectl get ` prints all the resource info as a table by
default. Sometimes there is just too much data and one row of the table is not
able to fit in one line. It takes time to comprehend that entire output. It
may be particularly useful to restrict columns by name. So for example in
context of resource pod, something like..
`kubectl get pods --filter names`
that would only pod names instead of an entire table containing all columns
like POD, HOST, STATUS, CREATED, etc. would be particularly useful.
Exact interface for this might need to be discussed and planned on a wiki.
(I'll try to update this issue with a more detailed suggest if I can think of
something)
