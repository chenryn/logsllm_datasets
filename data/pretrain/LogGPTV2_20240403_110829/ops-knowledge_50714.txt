I have developed a HIDServer (Bluetooth keyboard) using Python on my computer. The server has two L2CAP sockets (PSM 0x11 and 0x13) listening for incoming connections.

When I attempt to connect my iPhone to the computer, I observe an incoming connection in `hcidump`, but the connection is terminated by the remote host. My sockets never get to accept a client connection. Could you please help me with this issue?

### hcidump Output

**After starting my program:**

```
HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
  Write Extended Inquiry Response (0x03|0x0052) ncmd 1
  status 0x00
```

**When trying to connect the iPhone:**

```

### Additional Information

Initially, setting the class of device in my program did not work as it was being reset. To make the HIDServer function correctly with BlueZ, I had to set the class of device just before waiting for connections. I am unsure why the class of device gets reset, but I can confirm that it does. If anyone has insights into why this happens, I would appreciate the information.
