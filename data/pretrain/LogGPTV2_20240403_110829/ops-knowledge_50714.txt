User: I have developped a HIDServer (bluetooth keyboard) with python on my computer. There are 2 Serversockets (psm 0x11 and 0x13) listening for connections.
When I try to connect my IPhone to my computer, I receive an incoming connection (as can be seen in hcidump), but somehow the connection is terminated by remote host. My sockets never get to accept a client connection. Can you help me please?
hcidumps:
After starting my programm:

HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
      Write Extended Inquiry Response (0x03|0x0052) ncmd 1

Assistant: Setting class of device in my programm in the first place did not work as it got reset. To make the HIDServer work on blueZ I had to set the class of device right before I wait for connections. I cannot say why it gets reset, but I know it does. Maybe somebody else can tell why.
