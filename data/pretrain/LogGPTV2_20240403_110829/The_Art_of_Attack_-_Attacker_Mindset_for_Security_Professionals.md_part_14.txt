entirely. When we perceive the stakes as high, most of us zone in
on what we believe we should look for— situations like interviews,
first dates, first fights, watching politicians on TV or attempting to
work out if your other half is lying to you—f or these, we wake up,
take in more, and base a lot on our findings. Unfortunately, most of
us also tend to slack off during the everyday interactions. Nonver-
bal communication, though, is our most honest and reliable way
of transmitting information— even that which we might not want
communicated. Therefore, having the base knowledge and tools to
understand it are of the utmost importance as an attacker. First,
let’s sort out some myths of body language and nonverbal com-
munication.
A friend, Friend, mentor, and former FBI agent Joe Navarro tells
me that there’s no standard for catching a lie. A person’s eyes glanc-
ing to the left, nose touching, and fidgeting are myths of deception.
As Navarro says, not all throat- clearing and arm- crossing indicates
something. He refers to these actions as self- soothers, the things we
do to pacify ourselves in stressful moments. In fact, there is no silver
bullet for detecting a lie. You can only detect comfort or discomfort,
but that can lead to catching someone in a lie. Holistically, though,
this topic of deception detection has very serious consequences. His-
torically and even recently, people have been tortured, prosecuted,
and even executed when those in authority deemed them to be lying
or complicit purely based on their body language. There’s a large
price to pay for wronged individuals because of the perpetuated
Information Processing 115
myth that we, as humans, can “see” lies. With that myth now, hope-
fully, busted for you, let’s look at the 10 commandments Navarro
gives for observing people that will ring out the most information.
They directly align with observing people as an attacker:
Commandment 1: Be a competent observer of your environment.
Commandment 2: Observing in context is key to understanding
nonverbal behavior.
Commandment 3: Learn to recognize and decode nonverbal
behaviors that are universal.
Commandment 4: Learn to recognize and decode idiosyncratic
nonverbal behaviors.
Commandment 5: When you interact with others, try to estab-
lish their baseline behaviors.
Commandment 6: Always try to watch people for multiple
tells— behaviors that occur in clusters or in succession.
Commandment 7: It’s important to look for changes in a per-
son’s behavior that can signal changes in thoughts, emotions,
interest, or intent.
Commandment 8: Learning to detect false or misleading non-
verbal signals is also critical.
Commandment 9: Knowing how to distinguish between com-
fort and discomfort will help you to focus on the most important
behaviors for decoding nonverbal communications.
Commandment 10: When observing others, be subtle about it.
Another point about observing and making inferences on body
language is that patterns are often idiosyncratic, so you may have to
observe someone for a while, find their individual tendencies, then
make assumptions and predictions based on those. This is known
as capturing someone’s “baseline.” If you’re not paying attention
and observing, you may miss these baseline behaviors, and so your
chance of decoding someone’s behavior as it pertains to you and the
environment will be gone. To know if someone is showing comfort
or discomfort in your presence, consider their baseline before your
interaction where circumstances allow. This is where self-a wareness
can be used as a pliable, powerful tool. Being able to literally see
116 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
how you are affecting someone gives you the chance to subtly
readjust, and they will most likely adjust with you, consciously or
subconsciously.
Very broadly speaking, there are two types of self- awareness.
Internal self- awareness speaks to how you see your own passions
and morals—h ow you see yourself fitting with your environment
and your reactions. It also helps you see your effect on others. Exter-
nal self- awareness means being able to understand how other people
view you. If you can see how you might be affecting someone—
what they may think of you and what you have done or are doing to
lead them to that conclusion— you can then influence them to your
own benefit and for the benefit of the objective.
Self- awareness is a staggeringly complex topic, so I have chosen
to lace it throughout this book rather than confine it to one chapter.
Self- awareness used with observation is powerful; it will let you see
your effect on someone, and it will allow you the opportunity to
influence someone subtly through your own body language, non-
verbals, and all of your communication. Self-a wareness used with
observation is just as important as self- awareness used with interac-
tion. You have to be able to look at someone, a perfect stranger in
most cases, and accept that you do not know them, that their actions
and reactions might not be familiar to you or even what you expect.
But you must be able to observe and figure out how you are affect-
ing them and begin adjusting your behavior. This encompasses all
four laws of the mindset: you must know your end goal; you must
be gathering information, at this point on the person who stands
between you and your goal; you must keep yourself disguised as
a threat; and you must use the information gained from observing
and/or interacting for the good of the objective.
Observation Exercise
I often analyze people based on appearance— after all, you will
likely never know if you are right or wrong about someone if they
remain a stranger. You can use observation to take mental notes on
Information Processing 117
your target, and it’s a good way to build mental stamina, with oth-
ers as the central focus. It’s also a good way to satisfy your curiosity.
The caveat is that for many of the items I’ll list, you will need a
baseline to be accurate. A baseline is a state of behavior— essentially
what is steady behavior for a person as you observe them. It serves
as a standard against which to compare changes in behavior. Base-
line behaviors include how people sit, where they place their hands,
the position of their feet, their posture, and their facial expression.
Establishing someone’s baseline behavior allows you to determine
when they deviate from it. Often sudden changes in behavior can
be revealing.
An example of a baseline change might be the stillness that
comes over someone as they are asked what they perceive to be a
difficult question. If they are normally prone to fidgeting and ani-
mation— if that is their baseline—i t will be easy to note when they
become still.
People often employ pacifying behaviors, too. We use these to
calm ourselves— touching our necks and touching our beards may
help us calm down if we feel uncomfortable. As you now know,
there’s no one single behavior indicative of deception; there is no
Pinocchio effect. There are only behaviors that are indicative of
psychological discomfort or comfort. Someone sitting with their
arms crossed doesn’t signal anything other than a comfortable
position if they sit like that every day. However, imagine a woman
sitting on a bench in a park. You are observing her from a safe
enough distance, and she doesn’t appear to have noticed you. She
seems calm and relaxed. However, a man sits on the same bench
as her and she immediately crosses her arms tightly at her womb
and scrunches up her shoulders. You can assume these are signs
of discomfort given her baseline as you previously observed. Now
imagine that man gets up and walks away, and the woman visibly
relaxes. A few minutes later, another woman sits down at around
the same spot the man did, and the woman makes no changes to
her seemingly relaxed position. I can’t categorically state that the
woman doesn’t like men or that she has any problem at all with
men. But I can make some level of inference. I could infer that the
118 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
first person who sat down startled her or that he reminded her of
someone else. Ultimately, I know what changed, but I do not know
why it changed.
Cultural norms and baselines have to be taken into consider-
ation, too. For example, although the New York accent is really
a pool of accents drawn together in large part, from the Italian,
Jewish, Jamaican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Irish, and hip- hop
communities, New Yorkers speak very fast and are known to
drop consonants (hence “talkin’” versus “talking”). There’s a
baseline indignation to the talk. And they are often emphatic in
their delivery.
Finally, not every observation needs a baseline. You can just look
at someone’s nails to know they chew them. You don’t have to see
them stop or start doing it. You won’t always know why someone
changed their baseline behaviors, but if you are observant enough,
you will know what changed and be able to adjust your own behav-
ior if necessary to accommodate the situation and your goals.
So as you’ve seen, there is value in learning to be a competent
observer of your environment.
When beginning this exercise, I look at the person’s over-
all demeanor. Usually, I analyze their stance for this, quickly
followed by the general emotion shown on their face at that
moment. From there, given the chance, I make notes on their
appearance from head to toe, including perceived age, clothing,
how engaged they are in their environment, and from there, I can
make inferences.
Is their hair well groomed?
Tells me if they are influenced by vanity or if they were per-
haps rushed.
Are their pupils dilated?
May tell me if they are engaged and sometimes if they are on
medication— not an absolute rule, but it’s a telltale sign in some
situations.
Have they missed any spots shaving (if male)?
Tells me they don’t pay attention to details or they were in a rush.
Information Processing 119
Are their clothes ironed?
Tells me how organized they are and to what level they hold them-
selves. People often dress how they want to be perceived.
Do their clothes fit?
Tells me if they have recently lost or gained weight, which I can then
ponder over— if they’ve gained weight, are they stressed? If they
have lost weight, are they stressed or sick?
Are they wearing a wedding ring?
Tells me the obvious— usually.
If they are not wearing a ring, is there a mark?
Tells me if they are recently divorced, or if their clothes no longer fit,
it might signal their ring doesn’t either.
Do they bite their nails?
Tells me if they are nervous or if they have this tendency, and then
I look to see if they do it habitually when they aren’t using their
hands in a given moment.
Where do they hold their hands—f or instance, in their
pockets or on their hips, by their face?
Tells me how engaged they are and can lend some insight into their
psychological state. If they are holding their head up with their
hand under their chin, they are probably less engaged and more
familiar with their job. If they are standing and their hands are
behind their back, they may be analyzing me. Of course, they may
just stand like that out of habit, but time will tell.
Do they have any habits, like biting the inside of their
cheek or tapping their foot?
Tells me if they are fidgety, nervous, anxious, or waiting for
something.
What’s their tone of voice conveying?
Often tells me more than their words do. Subtext should not be
overlooked. People will generally tell you what they want to, just not
with their words.
Are they using colloquialisms that suggest they are from
around the area or from another part of the country?
Tells me the obvious or about travel. It is also a good needle to thread
as a conversation starter to find out more and more about them.
120 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Where are their hips pointing, especially if in a
conversation?
Tells me again how engaged they are. If their hips are pointing
directly toward the person they are talking to, they are at least inter-
ested. If they are turning away, they are likely signaling that they no
longer want to be part of the conversation. It might be because they
need to go to the bathroom, not because the conversation isn’t good.
Again, sometimes you will know the “what” but not the “why.”
Where are their feet pointed, especially if in conversation?
Tells me how engaged the person is in the conversation and if they’d
like to continue or leave.
If they are talking, where do they look when they
are talking?
Tells me their thought process. A lot of looking over their shoulder,
or the shoulder of the person they are talking to, can signal distract-
edness. Looking into the face tells me they are present and absorbed
(in most cases). Looking up and down the body tells me they are
judging or looking for more information about the person they are
talking to.
At what pace are they talking and at what volume?
Tells me if they are nervous, eager to have the conversation end,
dubious, or happy to help. Pace, volume, and even pitch are nonver-
bal signals, somewhat contrary to what you may think, considering
they are carried with the voice. Cultural norms and baselines have
to be taken into account. For example, many Scottish people talk
very quickly and it’s not to do with nerves, but in conjunction with
other signs, rhythm volume, speed, and pitch of voice matter and
can be telling.
And, my favorite, where are they looking when they are
supposed to be listening?
A person might look right at you when they are talking, but what
about when they stop and you start? If someone looks away quickly,
it may indicate they don’t want to hear your reply for any number
of reasons, including they think it will be negative, not what they
want to hear, or not something they care about. Someone looking
Information Processing 121
away after speaking doesn’t have to imply negative connotations,
of course.
The speed at which they move their eyes and head away also holds
weight. Someone might look away after they’ve declared their love,
only because they are shy. Someone might look away after they’ve
told a joke, and they are waiting to have you judge it as funny. But
how a person reacts after you stop talking should always inform the
rhythm, speed, volume, and pitch (RSVP) of your own response.
Now, it’s important to point out that it doesn’t matter if all of
these extrapolations hold true or not—i t’s good for both mental
agility and decision processing and making. However, if you are
standing in front of a target analyzing these things, some of them
may prove vital in deciding your next move— especially the latter
four listed. These can show if you have appropriately engaged the
target and, potentially, their internal emotional state.
Let’s return to the earlier example of the security guard. If he
appeared unkempt and somewhat disinterested, I would quickly
assume he didn’t care that much about his job, and it would help
me talk to him. I’d be far more casual than if the opposite were
true. But I would absolutely validate him by talking with him in
such a way that he understood I was happily giving him my time.
This could be accomplished through RSVP: rhythm, speed, volume,
pitch. These four things, given only with my voice, could help me
build rapport with him on a personal level, hopefully compelling
him to act upon my wishes.
However, if the security guard looked straight at me, unwaver-
ingly, without a normal blink rate, with his whole body pointed at
me after I’ve just explained my need for access, I might poise myself
to be asked a rather probing question. This sort of follow- up body
language could mean he is looking for more information about me:
he remains unconvinced. Of course, this is impossible to say with-
out a baseline and should be taken as an example only. But observa-
tion over time will help you parse body language and nonverbals
proficiently.
122 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
AMs and Observation
Observation is a core underpinning of gathering and processing
information. Seeing is not observing, and traditional observation is
not the same as the type needed for use by an attacker. AMs obser-
vation is a rigorous activity. To become effective and efficient at it,
you have to train your attention as an attacker, learning to focus
on relevant features and disregard those that are less noticeable.
Your brain is already taking them in. One of the best approaches
is through the old- fashioned practice of taking field notes: writing
descriptions of what you see in a given moment. Try taking notes
with a limited word count or with limited paper real estate— this
will force you to make decisions about what’s important and what’s
not. You might also consider keeping careful records of your obser-
vations, quantifying them whenever possible.
As an attacker, you must actively engage your curiosity: organ-
ize and analyze what you see. Although we all want to type queries
into Google, hopefully getting an answer that aids progression in an
engagement quickly, we should all be able to synthesize and inter-
pret the material we find ourselves emersed in. This is an essential
capacity needed to navigate attack life cycles and become a brilliant
attacker. You might want to Google the exit points for a building,
but if you saw a line of employees to the side of the building as you
pulled into the parking lot, you could then infer that an exit (or
entrance) is close to it.
A high capacity for observation will also allow for the detecting
