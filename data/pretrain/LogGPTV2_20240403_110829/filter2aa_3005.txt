Disclaimers 
I am not YOUR attorney 
•  Nothing you say to me is covered by attorney-
client privilege 
•  I don't know enough about your particular 
situation to advise you personally 
This is not "legal advice" 
•  This is a very general overview and may not 
apply to you or your specific situation  
•  Don't get your legal advice from someone at a 
con (even if we're correct about the law) 
What is Hacker Law School? 
The basic legal education you need  
(and should’ve been taught in high school), 
customized for the hacker community 
What You're Going to Learn 
The basics of: 
 Intellectual Property 
 Criminal/Civil Substantive Law 
 Criminal Procedure  
How the law applies to real life situations 
Why learn about these laws?  
                   If you're doing online security research, 
you need to be able to understand the risks. 
What do you mean by "risk"? 
A couple distinct, separate things. 
(1) The likelihood of becoming an attractive target for 
a lawsuit or prosecution, either with or without basis. 
(2) The likelihood that a court might decide that 
you’ve run afoul of the law. 
What You're NOT Going to Learn 
Anything other than the basics for risk-spotting 
To be afraid
