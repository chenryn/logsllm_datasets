User: Please give a simple Python program to count the number of occurrences of each word in a text.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a piece of text: ``` text = "This is a sample text. Here we are counting the occurrence of each word in this text." # Convert the text Convert to lowercase, convenient for counting words, and avoid repeated counting caused by different case The number of occurrences of a word for word in words_list: if word not in word_count: word_count[word] = 1 else: word_count[word] += 1 # Output the number of occurrences of each word for word in word_count: print(word + ": " + str(word_count[word])) ``` The output is: ``` this: 1 is: 1 a: 1 sample: 1 text.: 1 here: 1 we: 1 are: 1 counting: 1 the: 2 occurrence: 1 of: 1 each: 1 word: 1 in: 1 text: 1 ``` This program first converts the text to lowercase and then converts the text to a list of words. Next, using a dictionary as a counter, iterate through the list of words, and for each word, if the word is not in the counter, add it to the counter and set its count to 1, otherwise increment its count by 1. Finally, iterate over the counters, outputting the number of occurrences of each word.
