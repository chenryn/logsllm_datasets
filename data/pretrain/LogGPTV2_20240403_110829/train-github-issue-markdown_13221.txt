The default placement of the Tool tip `` next to the titled element is
causing `.btn` elements in a `.btn-group` to lose some styling. Specifically
the last button loses it's `border-radius` and the middle one appears to
either lose some negative margin or grows an extra `border-right`.
This is the mark-up in question

There is a workaround in specifying the `container` option in the `.tooltip()`
function.
    $('[title]').tooltip({ container : 'body' });
