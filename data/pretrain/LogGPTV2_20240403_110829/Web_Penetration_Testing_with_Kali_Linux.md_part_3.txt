for a web application Penetration Testing scope of work. Every scope of work should
be customized around your customer's business objectives, expected timeframe of
performance, allocated funds, and desired outcome. As stated before, templates
serve as tools to enhance a design session for developing a scope of work.
Penetration Testing methodology
There are logical steps recommended for performing a Penetration Test. The first
step is identifying the project's starting status. The most common terminology
defining the starting state is Black box testing, White box testing, or a blend
between White and Black box testing known as Gray box testing.

Penetration Testing and Setup
Black box assumes the Penetration Tester has no prior knowledge of the target
network, company processes, or services it provides. Starting a Black box project
requires a lot of reconnaissance and, typically, is a longer engagement based on the
concept that real-world attackers can spend long durations of time studying targets
before launching attacks.
As a security professional, we find Black box testing presents some problems when
scoping a Penetration Test. Depending on the system and your familiarity with
the environment, it can be difficult to estimate how long the reconnaissance phase
will last. This usually presents a billing problem. Customers, in most cases, are not
willing to write a blank cheque for you to spend unlimited time and resources on
the reconnaissance phase; however, if you do not spend the time needed then your
Penetration Test is over before it began. It is also unrealistic because a motivated
attacker will not necessarily have the same scoping and billing restrictions as a
professional Penetration Tester. That is why we recommend Gray box over
Black box testing.
White box is when a Penetration Tester has intimate knowledge about the system.
The goals of the Penetration Test are clearly defined and the outcome of the report
from the test is usually expected. The tester has been provided with details on
the target such as network information, type of systems, company processes, and
services. White box testing typically is focused on a particular business objective
such as meeting a compliance need, rather than generic assessment, and could be
a shorter engagement depending on how the target space is limited. White box
assignments could reduce information gathering efforts, such as reconnaissance
services, equaling less cost for Penetration Testing services.
An internal security group usually performs white box testing.
Gray box testing falls in between Black and White box testing. It is when the
client or system owner agrees that some unknown information will eventually
be discovered during a Reconnaissance phase, but allows the Penetration Tester
to skip this part. The Penetration Tester is provided some basic details of the target;
however, internal workings and some other privileged information is still kept
from the Penetration Tester.

Chapter 1
Real attackers tend to have some information about a target prior to engaging
the target. Most attackers (with the exception of script kiddies or individuals
downloading tools and running them) do not choose random targets. They are
motivated and have usually interacted in some way with their target before
attempting an attack. Gray box is an attractive choice approach for many security
professionals conducting Penetration Tests because it mimics real-world approaches
used by attackers and focuses on vulnerabilities rather than reconnaissance.
The scope of work defines how penetration services will be started and executed.
Kicking off a Penetration Testing service engagement should include an information
gathering session used to document the target environment and define the boundaries
of the assignment to avoid unnecessary reconnaissance services or attacking systems
that are out of scope. A well-defined scope of work will save a service provider from
scope creep (defined as uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in a project's
scope), operate within the expected timeframe and help provide more accurate
deliverable upon concluding services.
Real attackers do not have boundaries such as time, funding, ethics, or tools meaning
that limiting a Penetration Testing scope may not represent a real-world scenario.
In contrast to a limited scope, having an unlimited scope may never evaluate critical
vulnerabilities if a Penetration Test is concluded prior to attacking desired systems.
For example, a Penetration Tester may capture user credentials to critical systems
and conclude with accessing those systems without testing how vulnerable those
systems are to network-based attacks. It's also important to include who is aware of
the Penetration Test as a part of the scope. Real attackers may strike at anytime and
probably when people are least expecting it.
Some fundamentals for developing a scope of work for a Penetration Test are
as follows:
• Definition of Target System(s): This specifies what systems should be tested.
This includes the location on the network, types of systems, and business use
of those systems.
• Timeframe of Work Performed: When the testing should start and what is
the timeframe provided to meet specified goals. Best practice is NOT to limit
the time scope to business hours.
• How Targets Are Evaluated: What types of testing methods such as
scanning or exploitation are and not permitted? What is the risk associated
with permitted specific testing methods? What is the impact of targets that
become inoperable due to penetration attempts? Examples are; using social
networking by pretending to be an employee, denial of service attack on key
systems, or executing scripts on vulnerable servers. Some attack methods
may pose a higher risk of damaging systems than others.

Penetration Testing and Setup
• Tools and software: What tools and software are used during the Penetration
Test? This is important and a little controversial. Many security professionals
believe if they disclose their tools they will be giving away their secret sauce.
We believe this is only the case when security professionals used widely
available commercial products and are simply rebranding canned reports from
these products. Seasoned security professionals will disclose the tools being
used, and in some cases when vulnerabilities are exploited, documentation on
the commands used within the tools to exploit a vulnerability. This makes the
exploit re-creatable, and allows the client to truly understand how the system
was compromised and the difficulty associated with the exploit.
• Notified Parties: Who is aware of the Penetration Test? Are they briefed
beforehand and able to prepare? Is reaction to penetration efforts part of
the scope being tested? If so, it may make sense not to inform the security
operations team prior to the Penetration Test. This is very important when
looking at web applications that may be hosted by another party such as a
cloud service provider that could be impacted from your services.
• Initial Access Level: What type of information and access is provided
prior to kicking off the Penetration Test? Does the Penetration Tester have
access to the server via Internet and/or Intranet? What type of initial account
level access is granted? Is this a Black, White, or Gray box assignment for
each target?
• Definition of Target Space: This defines the specific business functions
included in the Penetration Test. For example, conducting a Penetration Test
on a specific web application used by sales while not touching a different
application hosted from the same server.
• Identification of Critical Operation Areas: Define systems that should not
be touched to avoid a negative impact from the Penetration Testing services.
Is the active authentication server off limits? It's important to make critical
assets clear prior to engaging a target.
• Definition of the Flag: It is important to define how far a Penetration
Test should compromise a system or a process. Should data be removed
from the network or should the attacker just obtain a specific level of
unauthorized access?
• Deliverable: What type of final report is expected? What goals does the
client specify to be accomplished upon closing a Penetration Testing service
agreement? Make sure the goals are not open-ended to avoid scope creep
of expected service. Is any of the data classified or designated for a specific
group of people? How should the final report be delivered? It is important
to deliver a sample report or periodic updates so that there are no surprises
in the final report.

Chapter 1
• Remediation expectations: Are vulnerabilities expected to be documented
with possible remediation action items? Who should be notified if a system
is rendered unusable during a Penetration Testing exercise? What happens
if sensitive data is discovered? Most Penetration Testing services do NOT
include remediation of problems found.
Some service definitions that should be used to define the scope of services are:
• Security Audit: Evaluating a system or an application's risk level against a
set of standards or baselines. Standards are mandatory rules while baselines
are the minimal acceptable level of security. Standards and baselines achieve
consistency in security implementations and can be specific to industries,
technologies, and processes.
Most requests for security serves for audits are focused on passing an
official audit (for example preparing for a corporate or a government
audit) or proving the baseline requirements are met for a mandatory set of
regulations (for example following the HIPAA and HITECH mandates for
protecting healthcare records). It is important to inform potential customers
if your audit services include any level of insurance or protection if an audit
isn't successful after your services. It's also critical to document the type
of remediation included with audit services (that is, whether you would
identify a problem, offer a remediation action plan or fix the problem).
Auditing for compliance is much more than running a security tool. It relies
heavily on the standard types of reporting and following a methodology that
is an accepted standard for the audit.
In many cases, security audits give customers a false sense of security
depending on what standards or baselines are being audited. Most standards
and baselines have a long update process that is unable to keep up with
the rapid changes in threats found in today's cyber world. It is HIGHLY
recommended to offer security services beyond standards and baselines to
raise the level of security to an acceptable level of protection for real-world
threats. Services should include following up with customers to assist with
remediation along with raising the bar for security beyond any industry
standards and baselines.
Vulnerability Assessment: This is the process in which network devices,
operating systems and application software are scanned in order to identify
the presence of known and unknown vulnerabilities. Vulnerability is a gap,
error, or weakness in how a system is designed, used, and protected. When
a vulnerability is exploited, it can result in giving unauthorized access,
escalation of privileges, denial-of-service to the asset, or other outcomes.
[ 13 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Penetration Testing and Setup
Vulnerability Assessments typically stop once a vulnerability is found,
meaning that the Penetration Tester doesn't execute an attack against
the vulnerability to verify if it's genuine. A Vulnerability Assessment
deliverable provides potential risk associated with all the vulnerabilities
found with possible remediation steps. There are many solutions such as
Kali Linux that can be used to scan for vulnerabilities based on system/
server type, operating system, ports open for communication and other
means. Vulnerability Assessments can be White, Gray, or Black box
depending on the nature of the assignment.
Vulnerability scans are only useful if they calculate risk. The downside of
many security audits is vulnerability scan results that make security audits
thicker without providing any real value. Many vulnerability scanners
have false positives or identify vulnerabilities that are not really there. They
do this because they incorrectly identify the OS or are looking for specific
patches to fix vulnerabilities but not looking at rollup patches (patches that
contain multiple smaller patches) or software revisions. Assigning risk to
vulnerabilities gives a true definition and sense of how vulnerable a system
is. In many cases, this means that vulnerability reports by automated tools
will need to be checked.
Customers will want to know the risk associated with vulnerability and
expected cost to reduce any risk found. To provide the value of cost, it's
important to understand how to calculate risk.
Calculating risk
It is important to understand how to calculate risk associated with vulnerabilities
found, so that a decision can be made on how to react. Most customers look
to the CISSP triangle of CIA when determining the impact of risk. CIA is the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a particular system or application.
When determining the impact of risk, customers must look at each component
individually as well as the vulnerability in its entirety to gain a true perspective
of the risk and determine the likelihood of impact.
It is up to the customer to decide if the risk associated to vulnerability found justifies
or outweighs the cost of controls required to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
A customer may not be able to spend a million dollars on remediating a threat that
compromises guest printers; however, they will be very willing to spend twice as
much on protecting systems with the company's confidential data.
[ 14 ]

Chapter 1
The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) curriculum lists
formulas for calculating risk as follow.
A Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the cost of a single loss to an Asset Value (AV).
Exposure Factor (EF) is the impact the loss of the asset will have to an organization
such as loss of revenue due to an Internet-facing server shutting down. Customers
should calculate the SLE of an asset when evaluating security investments to help
identify the level of funding that should be assigned for controls. If a SLE would
cause a million dollars of damage to the company, it would make sense to consider
that in the budget.
The Single Loss Expectancy formula:
SLE = AV * EF
The next important formula is identifying how often the SLE could occur. If an
SLE worth a million dollars could happen once in a million years, such as a meteor
falling out of the sky, it may not be worth investing millions in a protection dome
around your headquarters. In contrast, if a fire could cause a million dollars worth
of damage and is expected every couple of years, it would be wise to invest in a fire
prevention system. The number of times an asset is lost is called the Annual Rate of
Occurrence (ARO).
The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is an expression of annual anticipated loss
due to risk. For example, a meteor falling has a very low annualized expectancy
(once in a million years), while a fire is a lot more likely and should be calculated in
future investments for protecting a building.
Annualized Loss Expectancy formula:
ALE = SLE * ARO
The final and important question to answer is the risk associated with an asset used
to figure out the investment for controls. This can determine if and how much the
customer should invest into remediating vulnerability found in a asset.
Risk formula:
Risk = Asset Value * Threat * Vulnerability * Impact
It is common for customers not to have values for variables in Risk Management
formulas. These formulas serve as guidance systems, to help the customer better
understand how they should invest in security. In my previous examples, using the
formulas with estimated values for a meteor shower and fire in a building, should
help explain with estimated dollar value why a fire prevention system is a better
investment than metal dome protecting from falling objects.

Penetration Testing and Setup
Penetration Testing is the method of attacking system vulnerabilities in a similar way
to real malicious attackers. Typically, Penetration Testing services are requested when
a system or network has exhausted investments in security and clients are seeking to
verify if all avenues of security have been covered. Penetration Testing can be Black,
White, or Gray box depending on the scope of work agreed upon.
The key difference between a Penetration Test and Vulnerability Assessment is
that a Penetration Test will act upon vulnerabilities found and verify if they are
real reducing the list of confirmed risk associated with a target. A Vulnerability
Assessment of a target could change to a Penetration Test once the asset owner
has authorized the service provider to execute attacks against the vulnerabilities
identified in a target. Typically, Penetration Testing services have a higher cost
associated since the services require more expensive resources, tools, and time to
successfully complete assignments. One popular misconception is that a Penetration
Testing service enhances IT security since services have a higher cost associated
than other security services:
• Penetration Testing does not make IT networks more secure, since services
evaluate existing security! A customer should not consider a Penetration
Test if there is a belief the target is not completely secure.
• Penetration Testing can cause a negative impact to systems: It's critical to
have authorization in writing from the proper authorities before starting
a Penetration Test of an asset owned by another party. Not having proper
authorization could be seen as illegal hacking by authorities. Authorization
should include who is liable for any damages caused during a penetration
exercise as well as who should be contacted to avoid future negative impacts
once a system is damaged. Best practice is alerting the customers of all the
potential risks associated with each method used to compromise a target
prior to executing the attack to level set expectations. This is also one of the
reasons we recommend targeted Penetration Testing with a small scope.
It is easier to be much more methodical in your approach. As a common
best practice, we receive confirmation, which is a worst case scenario, that a
system can be restored by a customer using backups or some other disaster
recovery method.
Penetration Testing deliverable expectations should be well defined while agreeing
on a scope of work. The most common methods by which hackers obtain information
about targets is through social engineering via attacking people rather than systems.
Examples are interviewing for a position within the organization and walking out a
week later with sensitive data offered without resistance. This type of deliverable may
not be acceptable if a customer is interested in knowing how vulnerable their web
applications are to remote attack. It is also important to have a defined end-goal so
that all parties understand when the penetration services are considered concluded.
Usually, an agreed-upon deliverable serves this purpose.

Chapter 1
A Penetration Testing engagement's success for a service provider is based on
profitability of time and services used to deliver the Penetration Testing engagement.
A more efficient and accurate process means better results for less services used.
The higher the quality of the deliverables, the closer the service can meet customer
expectation, resulting in a better reputation and more future business. For these
reasons, it's important to develop a methodology for executing Penetration Testing
services as well as for how to report what is found.
Kali Penetration Testing concepts
Kali Linux is designed to follow the flow of a Penetration Testing service
engagement. Regardless if the starting point is White, Black, or Gray box testing,
there is a set of steps that should be followed when Penetration Testing a target
with Kali or other tools.
Step 1 – Reconnaissance
You should learn as much as possible about a target's environment and system
traits prior to launching an attack. The more information you can identify about
a target, the better chance you have to identify the easiest and fastest path to success.
Black box testing requires more reconnaissance than White box testing since data is
not provided about the target(s). Reconnaissance services can include researching
a target's Internet footprint, monitoring resources, people, and processes, scanning
for network information such as IP addresses and systems types, social engineering
public services such as help desk and other means.
Reconnaissance is the first step of a Penetration Testing service engagement
regardless if you are verifying known information or seeking new intelligence
on a target. Reconnaissance begins by defining the target environment based on
the scope of work. Once the target is identified, research is performed to gather
intelligence on the target such as what ports are used for communication, where
it is hosted, the type of services being offered to clients, and so on. This data will
develop a plan of action regarding the easiest methods to obtain desired results.
The deliverable of a reconnaissance assignment should include a list of all the assets
being targeted, what applications are associated with the assets, services used, and
possible asset owners.
Kali Linux offers a category labeled Information Gathering that serves as
a Reconnaissance resource. Tools include methods to research network, data
center, wireless, and host systems.
