### Title: BlackHat US-22 (Long) Dragon Tails – Measuring Dependence on International Vulnerability Research

This presentation will unveil the findings of a comprehensive study that examines the reliance of critical proprietary and open-source software on Chinese vulnerability disclosures. The environment for Chinese security researchers has become increasingly challenging, particularly following the passage of a law in September 2021, which mandates that vulnerabilities must also be reported to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in addition to the affected vendor. Despite these changes, the impact of such restrictions has not yet been systematically evaluated in the public domain.

In this talk, we will present the results of a quantitative analysis that tracks the changing proportion of vulnerability disclosures from Chinese sources to major software products, including both proprietary and open-source packages. Our analysis covers the following aspects:
- Temporal changes in the volume of Chinese-based vulnerability disclosures in response to the evolving legal landscape.
- Significant discrepancies between the observed data and the distribution of bug bounty rewards.
- Notable trends in the types and severity of acknowledged vulnerabilities.

The Chinese research community is renowned for its expertise, as evidenced by their success at events like the Tianfu Cup and the prominence of enterprise research labs such as Qihoo 360. However, recent laws aimed at providing the Chinese government with early access to these discoveries, along with the government's enforcement actions—such as the recent punishment of Alibaba—highlight the need for a more detailed examination of this issue.

This talk will delve into the implications for information security and the broader policy environment. We will also provide selected recommendations on how to address the potential "supply shock" of vulnerabilities resulting from the reduced contributions of the Chinese research community.
