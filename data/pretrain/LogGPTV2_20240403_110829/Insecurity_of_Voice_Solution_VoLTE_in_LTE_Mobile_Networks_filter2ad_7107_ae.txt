port is always 49158. We launch this app before making a VoLTE
call. During the call setup and termination phases, it is observed to
receive some UDP packets. We verify that they indeed belong to
the ongoing call’s RTP session.
Causes and lessons.
VoLTE requires substantial upgrades by
adopting IMS in the mobile network. It incurs complex operations,
which can be exploited for unintended purposes.
4.3 Voice-Muted DoS Attack
We launch an attack to compel the call to be mute, rather than
canceling the call service. Under this attack, the victim can al-
ways establish the call, but neither side can hear each other after
the call is answered. This requires a malware without root privi-
lege or voice call permission in the victim phone. Note that this
malware can be embedded into network applications.
There are two major steps to launch this attack during an ongoing
call. The ﬁrst step is to learn the ports of the RTP session as soon as
possible. We exploit V6 and/or V7 to do that. Exploiting V6 needs
to scan many ports. However, without root privilege, the network
socket returns only the error type of the ICMP messages instead of
their content. So we cannot retrieve the scanned port corresponding
to each received ICMP message within a socket. For this reason,
we do a group-based search. We aggregate ports into many small
groups and compare their smallest delay in each group. We then
scan each port in the group with the smallest delay to locate RTP
ports. It can be done within 20 seconds in our test phones. V7 can
easily aggravate the damage of the voice-muted attack by offering
a faster approach to probing session privacy. The session ID is
directly learned from the initial voice packets, without spending
time on searching for the session ID.
At the second step, the malware starts to hijack the voice bearer
by injecting forged RTP packets with the correct session ID. They
can mute both uplink and downlink voice, even though they are
for only the uplink trafﬁc. This is because the uplink trafﬁc of
RTP packets overloads one hardware component, Robust Header
Compression (RoHC), which is required by VoLTE for voice packet
(de)compression [5]. Figure 14 shows one run of the aggregated
voice-muted attack when V7 is exploited. The malware starts to
launch the DoS attack at the 8th second, after the call is answered,
and stops at 31th second. During the attack period, the voice at
both the caller and the callee become silent for most of the time.
Once the ID is leaked, this attack remains effective until the call
ends. The attack works no matter whether the malware is at the
caller or the callee.
5. RECOMMENDED FIX
The proposed defenses cover both the network and the device.
The network-side solution has three measures. Note that carriers

exert little control over devices and have more incentives to ﬁx
these issues.
First, the 4G gateway enforces strict routing regulation for each
bearer. This is to mandate that the trafﬁc carried by the signal-
ing/voice bearer is relayed by the 4G gateway only between the
phone and the signaling server or the media gateway in the IMS
core.
It eliminates V2. Since the hijacked control-plane access
on the device fails to reach any destination, it becomes less ur-
gent to ﬁx V1. However, without ﬁxing V1, it is still vulnerable
to data DoS attacks since precious radio resource might be wasted
before these packets are dropped by the gateway. This requires
the upgrade of the 4G gateway and can be done by adding ﬁlters
for VoLTE bearers. It may need extra effort when adding all valid
servers into the whitelist.
Second, the operator stops practicing free-signaling policy and
charges signals similar to data trafﬁc. This eliminates V3 and also
largely reduces user incentives to exploit VoLTE for data access.
However, this requires the upgrade of the billing system. The 4G
gateway should also enable its accounting for signaling packets.
The main challenge is not on the technical side but on the business
practice. It requires every user to possess a data plan. Today, voice
plans are independent of data plans.
In LTE networks, it seems
reasonable to let each consumer subscribe to a data plan for the
Internet access. A supplementary solution is to enable a VoLTE
data volume quota for each voice plan. When the volume is be-
low this quota, it incurs no extra charge. This quota is based on
the common usage case when the signaling volume for each call is
typically small. This approach does not require users to be aware
of the billing changes in benign scenarios, but abusing VoLTE for a
large amount of volume delivery can be identiﬁed and charged for
the extra.
Third, regarding DoS attacks, it calls for new mechanism to en-
sure resource allocation to authentic trafﬁc only. A naive solution
is to abandon high-priority QoS for VoLTE. However, it essentially
ruins the VoLTE’s appealing features. An alternative remedy is to
enforce the deferral mechanism. Once the trafﬁc is detected as fake
or junk trafﬁc, the volume will be accounted, and the source will
be traced back if the volume exceeds certain threshold. At runtime,
whenever the requested resource is larger than the quota, its priority
is decreased. This scheme relieves, but does not eliminate preemp-
tive resource waste. Ideally, the safeguard should be implemented
at the device to prevent non-authentic trafﬁc from being sent out.
However, this may raise a new form of exploit of blocked access by
leveraging the deferral mechanism if a malware is deployed at the
victim.
On the device side, we suggest two remedies. First, the mobile
OS should build a VoLTE permission that only allows the dialer
app to access the VoLTE interface. Malware should not easily ob-
tain private information. However, for a rooted phone, this pro-
tection might be bypassed. Second, the chipset enforces stringent
access control. For the trafﬁc from the OS, it needs to verify the
trafﬁc source and destination, as well as session port numbers, if
325applicable. This resolves issues in most common settings, but can-
not eliminate voice-muted attacks when a privileged malware on a
rooted phone is in place. This latter case calls for defenses against
mobile malware, which are complementary to above fences. Note
that the device-based solutions really help but do not sufﬁce. In
some cases of legacy or compromised devices, the network-based
solutions are still required.
Note that, the fundamental issues lie in the PS service and can-
not be completely addressed by above ﬁxes. The long-term so-
lution calls for concerted effort to design security defenses for the
given form of PS service with voice-speciﬁc policies (e.g., resource
consumption and billing). Our near-term solution aims to permit
VoLTE for authentic voice only. This is to ensure backward com-
patibility with current practice. As more services are empowered
by VoLTE (e.g., HD video conferencing), it might not be the best
choice any more. However, the rule is still applicable: When it
works as PS data, it should be treated as PS data. Keeping a clean
and consistent policy helps to eradicate unnecessary exploits.
6. DISCUSSION
We next clarify several remaining issues.
Bugs in early deployment?
Hard-core optimists might claim
that the revealed problems are implementation bugs at the early
stage of deployment. They are likely to get ﬁxed quickly as the
deployment proceeds. Indeed, it turns out that the vulnerabilities
we demonstrate are not hard to address. However, most of them
are rooted in the VoLTE technology itself, but not carriers’ speciﬁc
misconﬁguration. For example, both free-data and voice-muted at-
tacks are feasible in both carriers. They are not simple bugs either,
because where the vulnerability occurs is not equivalent to where
the negative impact occurs: the device-side vulnerability (e.g. V1)
results in network-side revenue loss, while the network-side vulner-
ability (e.g. V2 and V7) makes mobile device suffering from over-
charging and voice mute attacks. Uncovering these vulnerabilities
require a cooperative understanding of both the mobile device and
the network. Because of this, it is not surprising that top carriers
largely ignore them so far, and leave their deployed networks open
to these attacks. Our ongoing interactions with such carriers indi-
cate that, some of them are unaware of such loopholes even though
some are implementation and operation glitches. The deeper rea-
son is that, VoLTE has revolutionized the legacy voice service in
mobile carriers, and complete understanding of its impact on the
4G system security is still missing. Since the US carriers act as
leaders in the global market, the lessons from their early deploy-
ment are critical to the booming of secure VoLTE technology in the
future.
Symptoms of incomplete transition?
These problems can also
be attributed to the incomplete transition from the old-fashioned
mentality of mobile network to the Internet-style thinking. The for-
mer has been used to have control over all mobile devices since the
early CS-based network. In contrast, the latter considers no control
of devices, each of which can be potentially malicious. Since the
mobile network adopts the Internet technologies (e.g., IP), it has
been giving more freedom to mobile devices and gradually having
less control over them. However, its fundamental designs and op-
erations are not developed by completely following the Internet’s
way of thinking. This way can cause the mobile network to lack
protection against malicious mobile devices.
Blaming operators? While LTE operators and users suffer from
these attacks, our position should be misinterpreted as a directed
blame on network carriers (neither users). In fact, all parties con-
tribute to the threats. Reshaping voice from CS to PS warrants
substantial upgrades on all parties, including device OS and app
developers, mobile chipset vendors, network equipment manufac-
turers and operators. The developers and vendors for the device
OS, chipsets and network equipments should all share the respon-
sibility without upgrading their access (permission) control in time.
They together expose loopholes by the two IP interfaces for VoLTE
and normal data. Without a holistic view how VoLTE works, each
party takes a myopic approach to potential threats.
Incentives.
Our focus so far is on vulnerabilities, but not on
attack incentives. For certain attacks (e.g., free data access), people
are always motivated to leverage the loopholes. For other attacks
(e.g., DoS), it might be for fun or self interests for someone to block
another’s access to voice or data.
7. UPDATE
We are working with the industry to resolve the identiﬁed issues.
We have already informed a major chipset vendor of the potential
risks and are about to contact more vendors (including both OS and
network equipment ones) regarding VoLTE access control vulner-
abilities. We have also contacted both carriers to report and help
to ﬁx such vulnerabilities. So far, all data-relevant attacks, includ-
ing free data attack, overbilling, preemptive data and data DoS at-
tacks, have been ﬁxed in OP-I carrier networks, since data packets
through the VoLTE interface are not allowed to traverse the core
network. The ﬁx of voice DoS attacks, as well as the problems in
another carrier is ongoing.
8. RELATED WORK
Several studies have explored security implications of the com-
ponent solutions: IMS [22], SIP [31,36] and VoIP [17,19,38]. Park
et al. model the threat and analyze possible issues of the IMS
deployment [22]. Other studies [17, 19, 31, 38] examine SIP and
VoIP in the Internet context, without addressing mobile network is-
sues. They focus on caller ID spooﬁng or SIP message spooﬁng to
launch DoS/DDoS attacks. Recent reports (e.g., [1]) look into the
VoLTE security but are limited to issues (e.g., caller ID spooﬁng)
addressed by previous studies. Our recent work revealed another
voice DoS attack but it is launched through ﬁne-grained manipula-
tion of signaling messages in VoLTE [36]. In addition, most VoLTE
research focuses on its performance analysis or deployment plan-
ning [20,21,37]. Our study differs from all prior arts. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study on VoLTE security over oper-
ational networks. Our work covers both security analysis and real-
world impact, whereas early ﬁndings are obtained by security anal-
ysis or limited experiments in the controlled environment. More
importantly, the vulnerabilities and attacks discussed in this paper,
have never been disclosed before.
Mobile network security has been an active research area in re-
cent years. Peng et al. and Go et al.
identify the loopholes in
mobile data charging and devise free data access and overcharging
attacks [18, 23–25, 35]. Enck and Traynor and et al. devise DoS
attacks by overloading the control channel for SMS and other ser-
vices [15,32,33]. Researchers also disclose vulnerabilities in other
cellular-speciﬁc components, such as user authentication loopholes [11,
12], MMS spamming [29], information leakage at ﬁrewalls [27,28],
and WiFi-calling loopholes in T-Mobile [13], to name a few. Our
work is different since we look into VoLTE, an emerging voice ser-
vice to 4G LTE networks. Mobile malware has been another well-
covered topic (see [14, 39] for a few samples). Our DoS attacks
require a malware without root permission, and we leave malware
infection as an independent topic [16, 34].
3269. CONCLUSION
VoLTE is still at its early phase for global rollout. It is natural
to suffer from easy-to-ﬁx mistakes during this period. However,
we seek to sort out the fundamental issues beyond simple bugs and
errors. Bearing the telecom-based design mindset, VoLTE calls for
substantial upgrades on the infrastructure side (complex functions
in the core), and device updates as well. In this work, we examine
the security implications of VoLTE. We show that VoLTE can be
exploited to launch attacks against both the network operator (thus
beneﬁting mobile users) and an individual user. The user may gain
free and high-priority data access by abusing the VoLTE signaling
bearer to carry data packets. (S)he may also suffer from voice/data
DoS attacks due to spamming over the voice/signaling bearer.
Two lessons can be learned from our work. First, VoLTE op-
erates on both control and data planes. Its signaling and data are
implemented in both software and hardware at the device, and car-
ried by distinctive radio bearers within LTE. Consequently, to se-
cure both planes, the solution calls for concerted effort between
the network infrastructure and the end host, as well as the soft-
ware and the hardware at the device. Second, VoLTE leverages the
high priority services (compared with the low-priority, best-effort
delivery) in mobile networks to ensure quality calls. The priority
services supplemented by the LTE network may serve as an im-
plicit side-channel to leak conﬁdential information. As the voice
solution becomes compatible with the Internet design, it is prudent
to add more intelligence at the device and the network, to address
the double-edged, security side-effects of PS and IP.
