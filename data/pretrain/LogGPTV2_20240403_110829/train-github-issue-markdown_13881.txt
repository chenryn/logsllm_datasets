The layout of fancyzones depends on the number of programs active
When only one program is active, win + up maximizes  
Two programs, user preselects between split-screen or emphasis on either
program  
Three, preselection between all the configurations for three programs
If a new program opens, the rest auto-resize to the next fancy zones layout.
This is intended for users that have a dynamic quantity of programs open and
do not wish to manually adjust fancy zones settings as it is faster to
manually drag
