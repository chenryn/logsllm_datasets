# Analysis of Prediction Errors and System Behavior

## 1. Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plots
Figure 1: **Quantile-Quantile Plot of Two Innovation Processes**
- **Description**: QQ plots for two innovation processes (Vivaldi and NPS) taken from PlanetLab nodes running their own Kalman filters.
- **Observation**: The plots, typical across all nodes, show that the distributions closely follow a Gaussian distribution.

## 2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Prediction Errors
Figure 3: **CDF of Prediction Errors**
- **Description**: CDF of prediction errors observed across all nodes in the system.
- **Observation**: The vast majority of predictions are excellent, confirming the model's effectiveness in capturing system dynamics and adapting to current conditions.

### Table 1: Prediction Error Histogram
| **Error Interval** | **NPS** | **Vivaldi** |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| 0.0-0.05           | 257/830/922 | 232/854/943 |
| 0.05-0.1           | 32/201/995   | 44/180/941  |
| 0.1-0.15           | 5/3/992      | 18/5/229    |
| 0.15-0.2           | 1/997/997    | 2/12/884    |
| 0.4-0.45           | 4/3/56       | 3/5/12      |
| 0.45-0.5           | 1/12/12      | 2/1/17      |
| 0.5-0.55           | 1/985/985    | 2/32/40     |
| 0.6-0.65           | -           | 1/851/851   |

- **Note**: The table shows the number of nodes with prediction errors in each interval, the number of occurrences of the smallest and largest prediction errors observed in the interval.
- **Observation**: A few nodes contribute significantly to large prediction errors, particularly three nodes in India, which exhibited large average measured relative errors during embedding due to adverse network conditions.

## 3. Effective Behavior Representation
- **Kalman Filter Model**: The Kalman filter model represents the behavior of the embedding process by capturing the dynamics of the system through its convergence behavior (tracking of relative errors over time).
- **Calibration and Testing**: Each node calibrates its own Kalman filter from the measurements it observed during the embedding of its own coordinates in a cheat-free regime. After convergence, a new embedding process is started, and the prediction error (absolute value between the predicted and measured actual error) is measured.
- **Results**: Figure 2 shows the evolution of actual and predicted errors for a node on PlanetLab (similar behavior for Vivaldi and NPS). The prediction errors are small, indicating that the calibrated Kalman filter effectively captures the node's behavior in real-world conditions.

## 4. Representativeness of Surveyor Nodes
- **Surveyor Nodes**: A subset of trusted nodes (Surveyors) use each other exclusively to compute their coordinates, making them immune to malicious behavior.
- **Assumption Validation**: The behavior of the system as observed by Surveyors should approximate the normal behavior of the system as observed by other nodes in the absence of malicious behavior.
- **Experiment**: Randomly chosen Surveyors were used to validate this assumption. A population of about 8% of Surveyors was found to be representative of the overall population (Figure 4).
- **Optimal Deployment**: Using a k-means clustering algorithm, good representativeness can be achieved with roughly 1% of Surveyors (Figure 4).

### Figure 4: Impact of Surveyor Population Size on Representativeness
- **Description**: CDF of the 95th percentiles of relative errors observed at each node, compared with those of varying populations of Surveyors.
- **Observation**: A population of about 8% of Surveyors is closely representative of the overall population.

### Figure 5: Representativeness with 8% Surveyor Nodes
- **Description**: CDF of the 95th percentile of measured relative errors for a Vivaldi system with 8% Surveyors.
- **Observation**: Confirms that less than 10% of randomly chosen Surveyors is enough to gain a good representation of the system behavior.

## Conclusion
- **Prediction Errors**: The Kalman filter model effectively captures the dynamics of the system and adapts to current conditions, with a few outliers contributing to large prediction errors.
- **Surveyor Nodes**: A small percentage (8-10%) of randomly chosen Surveyors can provide a good representation of the system behavior. Strategic deployment (e.g., using k-means clustering) can further reduce the number of required Surveyors to about 1%.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and the effectiveness of the Kalman filter model and Surveyor nodes in representing and predicting system dynamics.
