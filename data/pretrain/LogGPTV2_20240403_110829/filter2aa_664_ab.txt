translations and their ranking are part of the secret shared by the two parties
that want to carry out the covert communication.
3.2
Selecting a translation
When selecting a translation to encode the hidden message, the encoder ﬁrst
builds a Huﬀman tree [17] of the available translations using the probabilities
assigned by the generator algorithm. Then the algorithm selects the sentence
that corresponds to the bit-sequence that is to be encoded.2
Using a Huﬀman tree to select sentences in accordance with their translation
quality estimate ensures that sentences that are assumed to have a low trans-
lation quality are selected less often. Furthermore, the lower the quality of the
selected translation, the higher the number of transmitted bits.
This reduces the total amount of substrate text required and thus the amount
of text the adversary can analyze. The encoder can use a lower limit on the
relative translation quality to eliminate sentences from consideration where the
estimated translation quality is below a certain threshold, in which case that
threshold becomes part of the shared secret between sender and receiver.
2 Wayner [29,30] uses Huﬀman trees in a similar manner to generate statistically plau-
sible substrate texts on a letter-by-letter basis.

3.3
Keeping the source text secret
The presented scheme can be adapted to be suitable for watermarking where it
would be desirable to keep the source text secret. This can be achieved as follows.
The encoder computes a (cryptographic) hash of each translated sentence. It then
selects a sentence such that the last bit of the hash of the translated sentence
corresponds to the next bit in the hidden message that is to be transmitted.
The decoder then just computes the hash codes of the received sentences and
concatenates the respective lowest bits to obtain the hidden message.
This scheme assumes that sentences are long enough to almost always have
enough variation to obtain a hash with the desired lowest bit. Error-correcting
codes must be used to correct errors whenever none of the sentences produces
an acceptable hash code. Using this variation reduces the bitrate that can be
achieved by the encoding. More details on this can be found in Section 6.

Lost in Translation
Modern MT systems produce a number of common errors in translations. This
section characterizes some of these errors. While the errors we describe are not a
comprehensive list of possible errors, they are representative of the types of errors
we commonly observed in our sample translations. Most of these errors are caused
by the reliance on statistical and syntactic text analysis by contemporary MT
systems, resulting in a lack of semantic and contextual awareness. This produces
an array of error types that we can use to plausibly alter text, generating further
marking possibilities.
4.1
Functional Words
One class of errors that occurs rather frequently without destroying meaning
is that of incorrectly-translated or omitted closed-class words such as articles,
pronouns, and prepositions. Because these functional words are often strongly
associated with some other word or phrase in the sentence, complex construc-
tions often seem to lead to errors in the translation of such words. Furthermore,
diﬀerent languages handle these words very diﬀerently, leading to translation
errors when using engines that do not handle these diﬀerences.
For example, languages without articles, such as Russian, can produce article-
omission errors when translating to a language which has articles, like English:
“Behind sledge cheerfully to run” [12].
Even if articles are included, they often have the wrong sense of deﬁniteness
(“a”instead of“the”, and vice-versa). Finally, if both languages have articles these
articles are sometimes omitted in translations where the constructions become
complex enough to make the noun phrase the article is bound to unclear.
Many languages use articles in front of some nouns, but not others. This
causes problems when translating from languages that do use articles in front of
the latter set of nouns. For example, the French sentence “La vie est paralys´ee.”
8
C. Grothoﬀ, K. Grothoﬀ, L. Alkhutova, R. Stutsman, M. Atallah
translates to “Life is paralyzed.” in English. However, translation engines pre-
dictably translate this as “The life is paralyzed.”. “life” in the sense of “life in
general” does not take an article in English. This is the same with many mass
nouns like “water” and “money”, causing similar errors.
Furthermore, because articles are also used as pronouns in many languages,
they are often mistranslated as such. Many of these languages also indicate
gender with articles and pronouns, such that if “the armchair” is male, it might
be referred to as “he” (in English) at the beginning of the next sentence, instead
of “it”. But because no context is kept by todays MT engines, if there is a man
being discussed in the previous sentence, he may also become an “it” in the next.
For example, the following two sentences were translated from a German
article into English with Systran (The“Avineri”mentioned is a political scientist
cited in the article): “Avineri ist nicht nur skeptisch. Er ist gleichzeitig auch
optimistisch.” is translated as “Avineri is not only sceptical. It is at the same
time also optimistic.” [22,28]. This lack of context makes correctly translating
such words diﬃcult.
Prepositions are also notoriously tricky; often, the correct choice of prepo-
sition depends entirely on the context of the sentence. For example, “J’habite
`a 100 m`etres de lui” in French means “I live 100 meters from him” in English.
However, [28] translates this as “I live with 100 meters of him”, and [12] trans-
lates it as “In live in 100 meters of him.” Both use a diﬀerent translation of “`a”
(“with/in”) which is entirely inappropriate to the context.
“Il est mort `a 92 ans”(“He died at 92 years”) is given by [28,12] as“He died in
92 years”. To say “He waits for me” in German, one generally says “Er wartet auf
mich”. [28] chooses to omit the preposition (“auf” entirely, making the sentence
incorrect (eﬀectively, “He waits me.”) Similarly, “Bei der Hochzeit waren viele
Freunde” (“Many friends were at the wedding”) yields “With the wedding were
many friends.” In each of these cases, a demonstrably incorrect translation (in
context) for the preposition occurs.
Another example is the following: in German, “nach Hause” and “zu Hause”
both translate roughly into English as “home”. The diﬀerence between the two
is that one means “towards home” and the other means “at home”. Because we
can say in English “I’m going home” and “I’m staying home”, we don’t need
to mention “towards” or “at”. When translating these two sentences to German
without explicitly stating “at home” in the second sentence, however, the engines
we examined produced incoherent sentences. [12] translated it as“Ich bleibe nach
Hause” (“I’m staying to home”), and [28] rendered a completely nonsensical “Ich
bleibe Haupt” (“I’m staying head”).
4.2
Grammar Errors
Sometimes, even more basic grammar fails. While this may simply be a measure
of a sentence being so complicated that a verb’s subject cannot be found, it is
still quite noticeable when, for example, the wrong conjugation of a verb is used.
In the following translation, “It appeared concerned about the expressions of the
presidency candidate the fact that it do not ﬁght the radical groups in the Gaza
Translation-Based Steganography
9
Strip” [22,28], the third-person singular subject appears directly before the verb,
and still the wrong form of the verb is chosen.
4.3
Word-for-Word Translations
One phenomenon which occurs again and again is the use of partial or complete
word-for-word translations of constructions which are not grammatically correct
in the target language. At best, this only results in word-order issues: “Was aber
erwartet Israel wirklich von den Pal¨astinensern nach der Wahl am 9.1.?” (“But
what does Israel really expect from the Palestians after the election on Jan-
uary 9?”) is translated by [28] as “What however really expects Israel from the
Palestinians after the choice on 9.1.?” In this case, the meaning is not hampered
because the construction is fairly simple, and the words translate well between
the two languages. However, in a language like Russian where possession is indi-
cated by something being “at” the owner, translation for things like “I have the
pencils” in Russian come out as “the pencils are at me” in a word-for-word En-
glish translation. Unnatural constructions based on word-for-word translations
are by far the most noticeable ﬂaw in many of the translations we looked at.
4.4
Blatant Word Choice Errors
Less frequently, a completely unrelated word or phrase is chosen in the transla-
tion. For example, “I’m staying home” and “I am staying home” are both trans-
lated into German by [28] as “Ich bleibe Haupt” (“I’m staying head”) instead of
“Ich bleibe zu Hause”. These are diﬀerent from semantic errors and reﬂect some
sort of ﬂaw in the actual engine or its dictionary, clearly impacting translation
quality.
4.5
Context and Semantics
As mentioned previously, the fact that most translation systems do not keep
context makes translation problematic. The Bare Bones Guide to HTML [31] is
a document giving basic web page authoring information. When the simpliﬁed
Chinese translation of this document’s entry for an HTML “Menu List” is trans-
lated into English, however, the result is “The vegetable unitarily enumerates”
[33,28]. While one can see that whatever the Chinese phrase for “Menu List” is
might in fact have something to do with a vegetable, the context information
should lead to a choice that does not have to do with food. Similarly, the German
translation ([28]) of“I ran through the woods”gives a translation (“Ich lief durch
das Holz”) that implies running through the substance “wood”, not the “forest”
sense. Without having enough contextual information, either based on statistics
or the preceding verb/preposition combination, the translator is unable to decide
that a forest is more likely to be run through than lumber is, and chooses the
wrong word.

4.6
Additional Errors
Several other interesting error types were encountered which, for space reasons,
we will only describe brieﬂy.
– In many cases, words that are not in the source dictionary simply go untrans-
lated; for example, an English translation of the registration for a Dutch news
site gives “These can contain no spaties or leestekens” for “Deze mag geen
spaties of leestekens bevatten.”
– Many languages use reﬂexive verbs to describe certain actions which are not
reﬂexive in other languages; the reﬂexive article is often translated regardless
of whether it is needed in the second language (e.g. “Ich kaemme mich”
becomes “I comb myself”).
– Proper names which also translate to common words are sometimes trans-
lated; “Linda es muy Linda” (“Linda is very beautiful”) is translated by [28]
as “It is continguous is very pretty” and “Pretty it is very pretty” by [12].
Moving the name does not always stop it from being translated, even when
capitalized.
– Verb tense is often inexact in translation, as there is often no direct mapping
between verb tenses in diﬀerent languages.
4.7
Translations between Typologically Dissimilar Languages
Typologically distant languages are languages whose formal structures diﬀer rad-
ically from one another. These structural diﬀerences manifest themselves in many
areas (e.g. syntax (phrase and sentence structure), semantics (meaning structure)
and morphology (word structure)). Not surprisingly, because of these diﬀerences,
translations between languages that are typologically distant (Chinese and En-
glish, English and Arabic, etc) are frequently so bad as to be incoherent or
unreadable. We did not consider these languages for this work, since the trans-
lation quality is often so poor that exchange of the resulting translations would
likely be implausible.
For example, when translating the “Bare Bones Guide to HTML” page from
Japanese [32] to English, [28] gives“Chasing order, link to the HTML guide whom
it explained and is superior WWW Help Page is reference.” (Note that italicized
portions were already in English on the Japanese page) The original English
from which the Japanese was manually translated reads: “If you’re looking for
more detailed step-by-step information, see my WWW Help Page.” The original
English sentence is provided only for general meaning here, but it is clear that
what is translated into English by the MT system is incomprehensible.
Because many translation systems were originally designed as a rough “ﬁrst
pass”for human translators who know both languages, it may well be that know-
ing the original language makes it possible to understand what is meant in the
translation; in some sense, translators using such a tool would have to consciously
or unconsciously be aware of the error types generated by the translation tool in
order to produce accurate translations from it. While we did not explore these

error types for this paper, an area for future improvement would be to look
into the error types in various language pairs by asking bilinguals about the
translations.

Implementation
This section describes some of the aspects of the implementation with focus
on the diﬀerent techniques that are used to obtain variations in the generated
translations.
5.1
Translation Engines
The current implementation uses diﬀerent translation services that are available
on the Internet to obtain an initial translation. The current implementation
supports three diﬀerent services, and we plan on adding more in the future.
Adding a new service only requires writing a function that translates a given
sentence from a source language to the target language. Which subset of the
available MT services should be used is up to the user to decide, but at least one
engine must be selected.
A possible problem with selecting multiple diﬀerent translation engines is
that they might have distinct error characteristics (for example, one engine might
not translate words with contractions). An adversary that is aware of such prob-
lems with a speciﬁc machine translation system might ﬁnd out that half of all
sentences have errors that match those characteristics. Since a normal user is
unlikely to alternate between diﬀerent translation engines, this would reveal the
presence of a hidden message.
A better alternative is to use the same machine translation software but train
it with diﬀerent corpora. The speciﬁc corpora become part of the secret key used
by the steganographic encoder; this use of a corpus as a key was previously dis-
cussed in another context [4]. As such, the adversary could no longer detect
diﬀerences that are the result of a diﬀerent machine translation algorithm. One
problem with this approach is that acquiring good corpora is expensive. Further-
more, dividing a single corpus to generate multiple smaller corpora will result in
worse translations, which can again lead to suspicious texts. That said, having
full control over the translation engine may also allow for minor variations in
the translation algorithm itself. For example, the GIZA++ system oﬀers mul-
tiple algorithms for computing translations [14]. These algorithms mostly diﬀer
in how translation “candidate outcomes” are generated. Changing these options
can also help to generate multiple translations.
After obtaining one or more translations from the translation engines, the tool
produces additional variations using various post-processing algorithms. Prob-
lems with using multiple engines can be avoided by just using one high-quality
translation engine and relying on the post-processing to generate alternative
translations.
