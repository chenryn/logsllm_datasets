### Description
in ChannelEventRunnable#run there is a switch-case fall through which is
introduced in `b3e91fa` .  
I believe this is a little mistake, and UT is not necessary.
As shown below, there is no `break` statement after `SENT`, I will send a pr
later.

                case DISCONNECTED:
                    try {
                        handler.disconnected(channel);
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        logger.warn("ChannelEventRunnable handle " + state + " operation error, channel is " + channel, e);
                    }
                    break;
                case SENT:
                    try {
                        handler.sent(channel, message);
                    } catch (Exception e) {

                                + ", message is " + message, e);
                    }
                   // no break statement here!

                    } catch (Exception e) {

                                + ", message is: " + message + ", exception is " + exception, e);
                    }
                    break;
                default:
