with the immune preﬁx respond with an ICMPv6 Destination
Unreachable message. Specifically, Xiaomi router, Gargoyle,
librecmc, and OpenWrt OS forward such a packet >10 times,
while the other routers and OSes all forward it (255-n)/2 times.
This section performs systematical measurements to evalu-
ate the impact of a widespread routing loop weakness, which
can be contrived to conduct DoS attacks with an ampliﬁcation
factor of >200. As a result, we discover 5.79M routers from
49 vendors existing this loop involving 3,877 ASes and 132
countries, with real testing, which need impending protection.
VII. DISCUSSION
Mitigation. We introduce three fold of mitigation solutions to
address the network security issues discovered in our work.
Firstly, we urge that the temporary and opaque IIDs should
substitute for the EUI-64 IIDs as recommended by [25], [36],
[39], [62]. The EUI-64 format address has been criticized for a
long term since [22], [61], because of the drawbacks for hosts
tracking, activities correlation, addresses scanning, and device-
speciﬁc information leaking. However, there is still 7.6% of the
discovered periphery using EUI-64 format addresses (Table II).

Secondly, we prompt the IPv6 ping packet should be ﬁltered
on the IPv6 periphery. Instantly, vendors should update device
ﬁrmware, especially the service software, and prevent services
from being open to the public by default, following [89]. RFC
4890 [28] describes it is not necessary to ﬁlter the IPv6 Echo
Request messages due to the large 128-bit address space. But
we show that by utilizing the ICMPv6 unreachable message in
response to the ping requests, IPv6 peripheries can be exposed
fast. Further, we suggest the security community, RFC groups
and ISPs inspect the IPv6 packet ﬁltering policy afresh.
Thirdly, to avoid the routing loop as shown above, we advise
that “Any packet received by the CE router with a destination
address in the preﬁx(es) delegated to the CE router but not in
the set of preﬁxes assigned by the CE router to the LAN must
be dropped”, standing in line with RFC 7084 [78]. The CPE
router should add an unreachable route for the unused preﬁx.
In conclusion, we emphasize that the IPv6 periphery is more
like a provisioning system. Therefore, its security and all IPv6
network security issues should be reconsidered thoughtfully.
Responsible Disclosure. All found issues were reported to re-
lated vendors and ASes. As for the routing loop vulnerability,
all 24 vendors conﬁrmed it and patched their routers and OSes,
and we received >131 vulnerability numbers (CNVD/CVE).
VIII. RELATED WORK
IPv6 Active Host Discovery. The state-of-the-art techniques
for global IPv6 network reconnaissance mainly includes, active
scanning with patterns or structures discovery [32], [38], [53],
[60], [79], [86], passive collection [17], [31], [43], [71], [81],
and constructing hitlists [30], [33], [34], [79].
The active IPv6 topology probing can also be used to gather
IPv6 addresses. Two measurement systems (CAIDA’s Ark [20]
and RIPE Atlas [74]) perform active IPv6 topology mapping
and traceroute ::1 or randomized addresses for each IPv6 preﬁx
in the global BGP table. Beverly et al. adopt [15] randomized
traceroute techniques to minimize the effects of rate-limiting
and discovered 1.3M IPv6 router interface addresses. C. Rye et
al. [77] use traceroute to discover the IPv6 network periphery.
Most recently, Padmanabhan et al. [68] show the sub-preﬁx
assignment often comes from one same /40 block and through
scanning preﬁxes from that /40, the search space for one EUI-
64 address is reduced to 264−40. However, their IPv6 scanning
perspective is still limited to the 128-bit end-host probing.
Previous techniques are mainly developed by inferring un-
derlying address patterns and structures with an address gen-
eration algorithm, which are constrained by the seeds and time
complexity. Besides, they are designed to unearth the 128-bit
IPv6 end-host, whereas we aim to discover the IPv6 periphery.
IPv6 Network Security. Previous works declare that the IPv6
network security issues should be taken into account carefully,
e.g., host tracking [25], [36], [39], [68], [70], host reputation
[50], preﬁx limiting [27], fragmentation and extension headers
security [16], [72], packet ﬁltering policies [14], [28], [89].
Particularly, some research works focus on the IPv6 address
security issues, including the IID generation mechanism [14],
[15], [34], [71], [77], [86], the preﬁx agility [71], the delegated
preﬁx rotation [71], [77], and the assignment stability [68].
Speciﬁcally, Czyz et al. [14] compared the security policies
of dual-stacked servers (520k) and routers (25k) and showed
that some ports are more open in IPv6 than IPv4. Besides, they
showed that a 1Gbps scanner could scan and identify 90% of
routers and 40% of servers from their datasets in <1h, due to
the Low-byte and EUI-64 format address. In addition to plenty
of EUI-64 addresses, Beverly et al. claimed that they received
“Time Exceeded” messages from many addresses covered by
one same /64 preﬁx and urged the community to consider the
implications of router-addressing practices [15].
Ullrich et al. [87] discussed a number of security and pri-
vacy vulnerabilities concerning IPv6 and their current counter-
measures systematically, including 36 security and 14 privacy
vulnerabilities. Among them, the routing header of type 0 can
form an ampliﬁcation attack by setting two routers’ addresses
alternately multiple times in the routing header, deprecated in
RFC 5095 [1]. The automatic tunneling mechanisms could also
force the routing loops. At a tunnel ingress point, a native IPv6
packet with a spoofed source address is encapsulated into an
IPv4 packet and forwarded, while the egress point decapsulates
the packet and forwards it back to the ingress point.
Our work serves as a complement to the existing IPv6 secu-
rity researches. With the ability of fast IPv6 network periphery
discovery, we explore the periphery’s network security issues.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst systematic and large-scale
measurement study on the IPv6 network periphery, in order to
understand the unintended exposed IPv6 security services and
the IPv6 routing strategy implementation ﬂaws. We highlight
that, although it is widely recognized that scanning the entire
128-bit IPv6 address space is inefﬁcient, discovering the IPv6
periphery under the small sub-preﬁx space can be impressively
gainful. Moreover, we show that the scope of the unintended
exposed IPv6 services is excessive in practice, facing potential
security threats. Furthermore, our work reveals the vulnerable
implementations on the IPv6 protocol stack. We demonstrate a
widespread IPv6 routing loop vulnerability through systemati-
cal measurements, which can be used to conduct DoS attacks.
Additionally, we release XMap to help the security community
carry out IPv6 network measurement studies and responsibly
disclose all security issues to related vendors and ASes. Our
research results also call for a review of current IPv6 network
security strategies and the protocol stack’s implementations.
