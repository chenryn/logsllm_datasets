### Systematic Measurement and Evaluation of IPv6 Routing Loop Vulnerability

When a packet with an immune prefix is encountered, certain routers and operating systems (OSes) respond with an ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message. Specifically, Xiaomi routers, Gargoyle, librecmc, and OpenWrt OS forward such packets more than 10 times, while other routers and OSes forward it \((255-n)/2\) times. This section presents a systematic measurement to evaluate the impact of a widespread routing loop vulnerability, which can be exploited to conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks with an amplification factor exceeding 200. Our findings reveal that 5.79 million routers from 49 vendors across 3,877 Autonomous Systems (ASes) and 132 countries are affected by this loop, necessitating immediate protective measures.

### Discussion

#### Mitigation Strategies

We propose three mitigation strategies to address the network security issues identified in our study:

1. **Temporary and Opaque Interface Identifiers (IIDs):** We recommend substituting EUI-64 IIDs with temporary and opaque IIDs, as suggested by [25], [36], [39], and [62]. The EUI-64 format has been criticized for enabling host tracking, activity correlation, address scanning, and leaking device-specific information [22], [61]. Despite these concerns, 7.6% of the discovered periphery still uses EUI-64 format addresses (Table II).

2. **Filtering IPv6 Ping Packets:** Vendors should update their device firmware, particularly service software, to filter IPv6 ping packets at the periphery. This aligns with [89], which recommends preventing services from being open to the public by default. While RFC 4890 [28] states that filtering IPv6 Echo Request messages is unnecessary due to the large 128-bit address space, our research shows that responding to ping requests with ICMPv6 unreachable messages can quickly expose IPv6 peripheries. We urge the security community, RFC groups, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to re-evaluate their IPv6 packet filtering policies.

3. **Avoiding Routing Loops:** To prevent the routing loop described above, we advise that "Any packet received by the Customer Edge (CE) router with a destination address in the prefixes delegated to the CE router but not in the set of prefixes assigned by the CE router to the LAN must be dropped," in accordance with RFC 7084 [78]. The CPE router should add an unreachable route for the unused prefix.

In conclusion, the IPv6 periphery functions more like a provisioning system, and its security, along with all IPv6 network security issues, should be reconsidered thoughtfully.

#### Responsible Disclosure

All identified issues were reported to the relevant vendors and ASes. For the routing loop vulnerability, 24 vendors confirmed and patched their routers and OSes, and we received over 131 vulnerability numbers (CNVD/CVE).

#### IPv6 Active Host Discovery

State-of-the-art techniques for global IPv6 network reconnaissance include active scanning with pattern or structure discovery [32], [38], [53], [60], [79], [86], passive collection [17], [31], [43], [71], [81], and constructing hitlists [30], [33], [34], [79].

Active IPv6 topology probing can also be used to gather IPv6 addresses. Two measurement systems, CAIDAâ€™s Ark [20] and RIPE Atlas [74], perform active IPv6 topology mapping and traceroute to ::1 or randomized addresses for each IPv6 prefix in the global BGP table. Beverly et al. [15] use randomized traceroute techniques to minimize rate-limiting effects and discovered 1.3 million IPv6 router interface addresses. Rye et al. [77] use traceroute to discover the IPv6 network periphery. Padmanabhan et al. [68] show that sub-prefix assignment often comes from one /40 block, reducing the search space for an EUI-64 address to \(2^{64-40}\). However, their IPv6 scanning perspective is still limited to 128-bit end-host probing.

Previous techniques primarily infer underlying address patterns and structures using address generation algorithms, constrained by seeds and time complexity. They are designed to uncover 128-bit IPv6 end-hosts, whereas our focus is on discovering the IPv6 periphery.

#### IPv6 Network Security

Previous works have highlighted the importance of carefully considering IPv6 network security issues, such as host tracking [25], [36], [39], [68], [70], host reputation [50], prefix limiting [27], fragmentation and extension headers security [16], [72], and packet filtering policies [14], [28], [89].

Specifically, Czyz et al. [14] compared the security policies of dual-stacked servers (520k) and routers (25k), showing that some ports are more open in IPv6 than in IPv4. They demonstrated that a 1Gbps scanner could scan and identify 90% of routers and 40% of servers in less than an hour due to the Low-byte and EUI-64 format addresses. Beverly et al. [15] noted that they received "Time Exceeded" messages from many addresses covered by the same /64 prefix, urging the community to consider the implications of router-addressing practices.

Ullrich et al. [87] discussed several security and privacy vulnerabilities concerning IPv6 and their current countermeasures, including 36 security and 14 privacy vulnerabilities. The routing header of type 0 can form an amplification attack by setting two routers' addresses alternately multiple times in the routing header, as deprecated in RFC 5095 [1]. Automatic tunneling mechanisms can also force routing loops. At a tunnel ingress point, a native IPv6 packet with a spoofed source address is encapsulated into an IPv4 packet and forwarded, while the egress point decapsulates the packet and forwards it back to the ingress point.

Our work complements existing IPv6 security research by exploring the security issues of the IPv6 network periphery. With the ability to quickly discover the IPv6 network periphery, we highlight the unintended exposure of IPv6 security services and the flaws in IPv6 routing strategy implementations.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present the first systematic and large-scale measurement study on the IPv6 network periphery to understand the unintended exposure of IPv6 security services and the implementation flaws in IPv6 routing strategies. Although it is widely recognized that scanning the entire 128-bit IPv6 address space is inefficient, discovering the IPv6 periphery under a smaller sub-prefix space can be highly beneficial. Our work reveals that the scope of unintentionally exposed IPv6 services is extensive, posing potential security threats. Additionally, we demonstrate a widespread IPv6 routing loop vulnerability through systematic measurements, which can be exploited for DoS attacks. We release XMap to assist the security community in conducting IPv6 network measurement studies and responsibly disclose all security issues to related vendors and ASes. Our research calls for a review of current IPv6 network security strategies and protocol stack implementations.
