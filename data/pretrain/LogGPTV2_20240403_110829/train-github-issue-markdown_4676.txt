# Steps to reproduce
Open new tabs until they exceed the edge of the titlebar
# Expected behavior
  * Existing tabs should be resized so all of them can be visible on the titlebar.  
Or
  * The tabs that exceed the titlebar edge should be aggregated in a single tab which: 
    * is positioned to the right of the titlebar
    * in it`s title has a value that represent the number of aggregated tabs
    * when clicked on it, opens a dropdown with the aggregated tabs and the user is able to select  
and switch to one of those
# Actual behavior
The tabs that exceed the edge of the window, are not visible.  
They are only selectable with shortcuts, but you would have to remember their
position or guess it, which is very unproductive.
