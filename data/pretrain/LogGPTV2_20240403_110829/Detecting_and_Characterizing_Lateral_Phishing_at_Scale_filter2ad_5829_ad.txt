(4.b) attempts to address this long tail by raising the similarity
requirements between Alice and Bob’s attacks before con-
cluding that former caused the latter. For successful attackers
labeled by heuristic 4.b, the longest observed time gap be-
tween PA and PB is 17 days, which falls within a plausible
timescale based on the aforementioned literature.
From this methodology, we conclude that 17 ATOs suc-
cessfully compromised at least 23 future ATOs. While our
procedure might erroneously identify cases where an attacker
has concurrently compromised both Alice and Bob (rather
than compromising Bob’s account via Alice’s), the ﬁrst two
criteria (requiring Bob to be a recent recipient of Alice’s
phishing email) help reduce this error. Our procedure likely
underestimates the general success rate of lateral phishing
attacks, since it does not identify successful attacks where
the attacker does not subsequently use Bob’s account to send
phishing emails, nor does it account for false negatives in our
dataset or attacks outside of our visibility (e.g., compromise
of recipients at external organizations).
6.2 Recipient Targeting
In this section, we estimate the conversion rate of our dataset’s
lateral phishing attacks, and discuss four recipient targeting
strategies that reﬂect the behavior of most attackers in our
dataset.
Recipient Volume and Estimated Conversation Rate: Cu-
mulatively, the lateral phishers in our dataset contact 101,276
unique recipients, where 41,740 belong to the same organi-
zation as the ATO. As shown in Figure 5, more than 94%
of the attackers send their phishing emails to over 100 re-
cipients; with respect to the general population of all lateral
phishers, this percentage likely overestimates the prevalence
of high “recipient-volume” attackers, since our detector draws
on recipient-related features.
Targeting hundreds of people gives attackers a larger pool
of potential victims, but it also incurs a risk that a recipient
will detect and ﬂag the attack either to their security team or

their fellow recipients (e.g., via Reply-All). To isolate their
victims and minimize the ability for fellow recipients to warn
each other, we found that attackers frequently contact their
recipients via a mass BCC or through many individual emails.
Aside from this containment strategy, we also estimate that
our dataset’s lateral phishing attacks have a difﬁcult time fool-
ing an individual employee, and thus might require targeting
many recipients to hijack a new account. Earlier in Section 6.1,
we found that 17 ATOs successfully compromised 23 new
accounts. Looking at the number of accounts they success-
fully hijacked divided by the number of fellow employees
they targeted, the median conversation rate for our attackers
was one newly hijacked account per 542 fellow employees;
the attacker with the best conversation rate contacted an aver-
age of 26 employees per successful compromise. We caution
that our method for determining whether an attack succeeded
(§ 6.1) does not cover all cases, so our conversation rate might
also underestimate the success of these attacks in practice.
But if our estimated conversion rate accurately approximates
the true rate, it would explain why these attackers contact so
many recipients, despite the increased risk of detection.
Recipient Targeting Strategies: Anecdotally, we know that
some lateral phishers select their set of victims by leveraging
information in the hijacked account to target familiar users;
for example, sending their attack to a subset of the account’s
“Contact Book”. Unfortunately our dataset does not include
information about any reconnaissance actions that an attacker
performed to select their phishing recipients (e.g., explicitly
searching through a user’s contact book or recent recipients).
Instead, we empirically explore the recipient sets across
our dataset’s attackers to identify plausible strategies for how
these attackers might have chosen their set of victims. Four re-
cipient targeting strategies, summarized in Table 3 (explained
below), reﬂect the behavior of all but six attackers in our
dataset. To help assess whether a recipient and the ATO share
a meaningful relationship, we compute each ATO’s recent
contacts: the set of all email addresses whom the ATO sent
at least one email to in the 30 days preceding the ATO’s
phishing emails. While some attackers (28.6%) speciﬁcally

target many of an account’s recent contacts, the majority of
lateral phishers appear more interested in either contacting
many arbitrary recipients or sending phishing emails to a large
fraction of the hijacked account’s organization.
Account-agnostic Attackers: Starting with the least-targeted
behavior, 63 ATOs in our dataset sent their attacks to a wide
range of recipients, most of whom do not appear closely re-
lated to the hijacked account. We call this group Account-
agnostic attackers, and identify them using two heuristics.
First, we categorize an attacker as Account-agnostic if
less than 1% of the recipients belong to the same organi-
zation as the ATO, and further exploration of their recipients
does not reveal a strong connection with the account. Ex-
amining the right-hand graph in Figure 5, 37 ATOs target
recipient sets where less than 1% of the recipients belong
to the same organization as the ATO. To rule out the possi-
bility that these attackers’ recipients are nonetheless related
to the account, we computed the fraction of recipients who
appeared in each ATO’s recent contacts; for all of the 37 pos-
sible Account-agnostic ATOs, less than 17% of their attack’s
total recipients appeared in their recent contacts. Among these
37 candidate Account-agnostic ATOs, 33 of them contact re-
cipients at 10 or more organizations (unique recipient email
domains), 2 of them exclusively target either Gmail or Hot-
mail accounts, and the remaining 2 ATOs are best described
as Lateral-organization attackers (below).5 Excluding the 2
Lateral-organization attackers, the 35 ATOs identiﬁed by this

cipients, belonging to either many different organizations or
exclusively to personal email hosting services (e.g., Gmail
and Hotmail), and only a small percentage of these recipients
appeared in the ATO’s recent contacts; as such, we label these
35 attackers as Account-agnostic.
Second, we expand our search for Account-agnostic attack-
ers by searching for attackers where less than 50% of the
ATO’s total recipients also belong to the ATO’s organization,
and where the ATO contacts recipients at many different or-
ganizations; speciﬁcally, where the ATO’s phishing recipients
belonged to over twice as many unique domains as all of the
email addresses in ATO’s recent contacts. This search identi-
ﬁed 63 ATOs. To ﬁlter out attackers in this set who may have
drawn on the hijacked account’s recent contacts, we exclude
any ATO where over 17% of their attack’s total recipients
also appeared in the ATO’s recent contacts (17% was the
maximum percentage among ATOs from the ﬁrst Account-
agnostic heuristic). After applying this last condition, our
second heuristic identiﬁes 54 Account-agnostic attackers.
Combining and deduplicating the ATOs from both criteria
results in a total of 63 Account-agnostic attackers (40.9%):
lateral phishers who predominantly target recipients without
close relationships to the hijacked account or its organization.
Lateral-organization Attackers: During our exploration
of potential Account-agnostic ATOs, we uncovered 2 at-
tackers whom we label under a different category: Lateral-
organization attackers. In both these cases, less than 1% of
the attacker’s recipients belonged to the same organization as
the ATO, but each attacker’s recipients did belong to organi-
zations within the same industry as the ATO’s organization.
This thematic characteristic among the recipients suggests
a deliberate strategy to spread across organizations within
the targeted industries, so accordingly, we categorize them as
Lateral-organization attackers.
Organization-wide Attackers: Ofﬁce 365 provides a
“Groups” feature that lists the different groups that an account
belongs to [30]. For some enterprises, this feature enumerates
most, if not all, employees at the organization. Thus, lateral
phishers who wish to cast a wide phishing net might adopt a
simple strategy of sending their attack to everyone at the or-
ganization. We call these ATOs Organization-wide attackers
and identify them through two ways.
First, we search for any attackers where at least half of their
phishing recipients belong to the ATO’s organization, and
where at least 50% of the organization’s employees received
the phishing email (i.e., the majority of a phisher’s victims
were employees and the attacker targeted a majority of the en-
terprise); this search yielded a total of 16 ATOs. We estimate
the list of an organization’s employees by building a set of all
employee email addresses who sent or received email from
Figure 6: CDF: the x-axis displays what % of the ATO’s recent
contacts received a lateral phishing email (§ 6.2). The bottom teal
graph ﬁlters the ATOs to exclude any ATO identiﬁed as Account-
agnostic, Lateral-organization, and Organization-wide attackers; at
the vertical black line, 88% of these ﬁltered ATOs send phishing

anyone during the entire month of the phishing incident.6 For
all of these 16 ATOs, less than 11% of the recipients they
target also appear in their recent contacts. Coupled with the
fact that each of these ATOs contacts over 1,300 recipients,
their behavior suggests that their initial goal focuses on phish-
ing as many of the enterprise’s recipients as possible, rather
than targeting users particularly close to the hijacked account.
Accordingly, we categorize them as Organization-wide attack-
ers.
Our second heuristic looks for attackers whose recipient set
consists nearly entirely of fellow employees, but where the ma-
jority of the organization does not necessarily receive a phish-
ing email. Revisiting Figure 5, 36 candidate Organization-
wide ATOs sent over 95% of their phishing emails to fellow
employee recipients. However, we again need to exclude and
account for ATOs who leverage their hijacked account’s recent
contacts. From the ﬁrst Organization-wide heuristic discussed
previously, we saw that less than 11% of the recipients of
that heuristic’s Organization-wide attackers came from the
ATO’s recent contacts. Using this value as a ﬁnal threshold
for this second candidate set of Organization-wide attackers,
we identify 29 Organization-wide attackers where over 95%
of their recipients belong to the ATO’s organization but less
than 11% of the recipients came from the ATO’s recent con-
tacts; a combination that suggests the attacker seeks primarily
to compromise other employees, but who do not necessarily
have a personal connection with the hijacked account.
Aggregating and deduplicating the two sets of lateral phish-
ers from above produces a total of 39 Organization-wide
attackers (25.3%), who take advantage of the information in
a hijacked account to target many fellow employees.
6This collection likely overestimates the actual set of employees because
of service addresses, mailing list aliases, and personnel churn.

rized 50 ATOs, we cannot conclusively determine the attack-
ers’ recipient targeting strategies because our dataset does
not provide us with the full set of information and actions
available to the attacker. Nonetheless, Figure 6 presents some
evidence that 44 of these remaining attackers do draw upon
the hijacked account’s prior relationships. Speciﬁcally, 44
attackers sent their attacks to at least 33% of the addresses in
the ATO’s recent contacts.7 Since these ATOs sent attacks to
at least 1 out of every 3 of the ATO’s recently contacted recipi-
ents, these attackers appear interested in targeting a substantial
fraction of users with known ties to the hijacked account. As
such, we label these 44 ATOs as Targeted-recipient attackers.
6.3 Message Content: Tailoring and Themes
Since lateral phishers control a legitimate employee account,
these attackers could easily mine recent emails to craft per-
sonalized spearphishing messages. To understand how much
attackers do leverage their privileged access in their phishing
attacks, this section characterizes the level of tailoring we
see among lateral phishing messages. Overall, only 7% of
our dataset’s incidents contain targeted content within their
messages. Across the phishing emails that used non-targeted
content, the attackers in our dataset relied on two predomi-
nant narratives (deceptive pretexts) to lure their victim into
performing a malicious action. The combination of these two
results suggests that, for the present moment, these attackers
(across dozens of organizations) see more value in opportunis-
tically phishing as many recipients as possible, rather than
investing time to mine the hijacked accounts for personalized
spearphishing fodder.
Content Tailoring: When analyzing the phishing messages
in our dataset, we found that two dimensions aptly character-
ized the different levels of content tailoring and customization.
The ﬁrst dimension, “Topic tailoring”, describes how person-
alized the topic or main idea of the email is to the victim
or organization. The second dimension, “Name tailoring”,
describes how speciﬁcally the attacker addresses the victim
(e.g., “Dear user” vs. “Dear Bob”). For each of these two
dimensions, we enumerate three different levels of tailoring
and provide an anonymized message snippet below; we use
Bob to refer to one of the attack’s recipients and FooCorp for
the company that Bob works at.
1. Topic tailoring: the uniqueness and relevancy of the mes-
sage’s topic to the victim or organization:
7When examining and applying thresholds for the Account-agnostic and
Organization-wide Attackers, we used a slightly different fraction: how many
of the ATO’s phishing recipients also appeared in their recent contacts?
Here, we seek to capture attackers who make a speciﬁc effort to target a
considerable number of familiar recipients. Accordingly, we look at the
fraction of the ATO’s recent contacts that received phishing emails, where
the denominator reﬂects the number of users in the ATO’s recent contacts,
rather than the ATO’s total number of phishing recipients.

speciﬁc the message’s topic pertains to the victim or organization.
The rows correspond to whether the phishing email explicitly names
the recipient or organization.

could be sent to any user (“You have a new shared
document available.”)
(b) Broadly enterprise related topic: a message that ap-
pears targeted to enterprise environments, but one
that would also make sense if the attacker used it at
many other organizations (“Updated work sched-
ule. Please distribute to your teams.”)
(c) Targeted topic: a message where the topic clearly
relies on speciﬁc details about the recipient or or-
ganization (“Please see the attached announcement
about FooCorp’s 25th year anniversary.”, where
FooCorp has existed for exactly 25 years.)
