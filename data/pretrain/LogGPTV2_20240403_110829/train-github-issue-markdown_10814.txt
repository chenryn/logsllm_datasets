##### Description of the problem
So I have tried to adjust the `linewidth` in the `LineBasicMaterial` but it
only renders out as 1 pixel instead of 5 (which is where I am trying to
adjust). I have tried to preview this in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari but to no
success. Any idea on why this isn't working. I read the docs and followed the
way its used.
