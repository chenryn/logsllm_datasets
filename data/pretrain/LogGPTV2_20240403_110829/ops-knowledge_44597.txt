User: To properly test a piece of software (written in C) I have been working on, I have to run a high volume of tests. I've been doing this with a python script that executes my software a given number of times (generally in the range of 1000 - 10000 repititions), one after the other. I am working on a debian virtual machine (500mb ram). I've been noticing that over time the performance of the program depreciates significantly. Usually I have to go so far as rebooting the vm to get back to normal performance levels.
My first thought was a memory leak, but valgrind did not discover any in my C program. Furthermore, I would have thought the OS would take care of that after program termination either way. When I run top or free -m, I see that free ram is fairly low (20-70mb), but does not drop much while running my script, instead fluctuating around where it started.
Edit: A full rundown on what my files are doing is as follows:
C software 

Many files, developed by various people
Features a loop that continues until given destination IP has been discovered
Constructs packets based off of given destination and information received from previously sent packets
Sends packets
Waits for packet replies

Python script emulating network topology

Stores fake networks
Intercepts outgoing packets and sends replies based off of said topology

Python testing script

For a given number of repetitions,
Launch network emulator
Launch C software (wait until terminated - the process launches are actually done with a bash script)
Exit network emulator

Output for the emulator and the c software are both dumped to log files, which are overwritten at each execution (so they should be kept decently short).
Can anyone give me some pointers as to what this could be?
Assistant: this could be:

some leak in the python script
waiting on a resource in the c script/python script
writing to a file that gets bigger during the run
C software doesn't close properly

and so on. You could elaborate on what the C software does to get us more clues, also state whether other software also runs more slowly.
