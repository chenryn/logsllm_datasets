User: I would like to wipe out all data for a specific kind in Google App Engine. What is the
best way to do this?
I wrote a delete script (hack), but since there is so much data is
timeout's out after a few hundred records.
Assistant: Unfortunately, there's no way to easily do a bulk delete. Your best bet is to write a script that deletes a reasonable number of entries per invocation, and then call it repeatedly - for example, by having your delete script return a 302 redirect whenever there's more data to delete, then fetching it with "wget --max-redirect=10000" (or some other large number).
