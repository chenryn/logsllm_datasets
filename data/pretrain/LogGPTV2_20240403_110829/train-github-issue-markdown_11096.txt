If a package is uninstalled while disabled, its entry in 'disabledPackages' is
left behind. It should probably be deleted.
Similarly, any config for the package being removed is also left in
`config.cson`. There is possibly more of a reason to leave this behind (don't
want to nuke the user's settings), but deletion of these should maybe also be
considered.
Not a huge deal, just something I noticed.
