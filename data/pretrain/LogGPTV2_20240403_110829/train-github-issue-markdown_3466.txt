When **Role Includes the Role** , the template module browse the incorrect
path looking for a template file
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
    [run with -vvvvv to see the paths]
    TASK [app_campaigns_manager : Ensure service configuration] ********************
    task path: /home/me/ansible/etc/playbooks/roles/app_generic/tasks/service.yml:1
    looking for "upstart.conf" at "/home/me/ansible/etc/playbooks/roles/app_campaigns_manager/templates/upstart.conf"
    looking for "upstart.conf" at "/home/me/ansible/etc/playbooks/roles/app_campaigns_manager/upstart.conf"
    looking for "upstart.conf" at "/home/me/ansible/etc/playbooks/roles/app_generic/tasks/templates/upstart.conf"   role: app_campaigns_manager -> role: app_generic`
    playbook.yml
    (...)
     roles: app_campaigns_manager 
    roles/app_campaigns_manager/tasks/main.yml
    (...)
    - include: ../../app_so1_generic/tasks/main.yml
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Browse the proper files :)
I know the template_module has 'template_path' and 'template_fullpath', but
still it would be nice it the roles would be aware of it's location
independent of it's include/execution.

I may take a minute later, to prepare PR, but having rather busy time, so any
help appreciated.
