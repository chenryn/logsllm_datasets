phenomena under other languages (e.g., English), regions and
channels.
Dependency of implementation. We leveraged the internal
APIs and scanners from Baidu to implementat KDES. These
components enabled KDES to uncover a large quantity of

are supported by Alibaba and Tencent, giant IT companies in China, the
provider of Haipay is less known to the public.
black keywords in a short time. One would question how
KDES performs when deployed by other organizations when
the access to these components is not available. Our assessment
is that the efﬁciency might be reduced (e.g., more time will be
consumed for search query without unthrottled API) but the
effectiveness should not be affected. Each component outside
the territory of KDES could be replaced by a component open
to the public. For instance, the scanners from Baidu could be
replaced by other public scanners, like VirusTotal [33].
Responsible disclosure and deployment. We reported all the
detected black keywords (and the associated core words) to the
security team of Baidu. The feedback so far is quite positive.
Many black keywords have been conﬁrmed and included by
Baidu. Following this trail, we will keep KDES running and
continuously send reports to Baidu. In summary, we envision
four use cases that KDES could beneﬁt search engines and
other parties:
1) It helps search engines to regulate search queries con-
taining black keywords.
2) The detected URLs can be divided into more precise
categories. As an example, Baidu currently divides
the URLs about the underground economy into three
categories: lottery, pornography and fraud. The result
can be reﬁned with the help of KDES.
3) Search ads are regulated under stricter policies but we
found the underground merchants were able to exploit the
weakness of the screening process and sneak in illegal
ads. KDES could assist auditors in understanding the real
business behind the search ads and rejecting the illegal
ones.
4) Other parties, like legal authorities, could learn the trend
of the underground economy after digesting the black
keywords discovered by KDES. Finding illegal activities
in other channels will be also easier.
A large amount of search queries have been issued to Baidu
during our study, which could incur some noticeable overhead
on their servers. We tried to conﬁne the overhead by scheduling
the queries running in nighttime when the servers were used
less intensively. The search result scanner fetches the page
for a URL when there is no match in its cache. If the URL
belongs to search ad, the advertiser might be charged unfairly.
We excluded the URLs of search ads to avoid such charges.
VII. RELATED WORK
Blackhat SEO. Blackhat SEO has been extensively leveraged
to disseminate malicious/fraudulent content of cyber-criminals.
A lot of efforts have been spent by search engine companies,
security companies and academic institutes towards mitigating
this issue. There are mainly two lines of works in this area.
First, a plenty of works revealed the strategies of Blackhat
SEOers, including constructing SEO botnet [34], spamming
forums [35], compromising legitimate sites [36], text spin [37]
and cloaking [38], [39]. Through exploiting the difference
between promotion models of blackhat and whitehat SEO, the
sites manipulating search rankings can be detected in large

scale [36], [37], [40]. The second line of research focused
on understanding and measuring the ecosystems of blackhat
SEO business. Previous studies showed that pharmaceutical
afﬁliate programs and stores selling fake products largely rely
on blackhat SEO to reach potential buyers [41], [42], [43].
Our recent work et al. [8] uncovered a new blackhat SEO
technique using wildcard DNS (spider pool) to tamper search
rankings under long-tail keywords. This work consumed the
data (SEO pages) from spider pools but the goal is different here.
We aim at detecting keywords targeted by adversaries (black
keywords), while the main focus of our last work is detecting
sites boosted by blackhat SEO. As described in Section VI,
ﬁnding and understanding black keywords could beneﬁt many
parties (e.g., legal authorities) in addition to search engine
companies. The result here facilitate the investigations in other
channels (e.g., social networks) since the vocabulary of black
keywords is usually shared.
The underground economy. Understanding and measuring
the underground economy is an active research area for a
long time. There have been many works providing insights
into the operational models and ecosystems of cybercrimes,
including email spam [42], pay-per-install malware [44],
unwanted software [45], [46], Twitter spam [47], illicit online
pharmacies [48], [41] and etc. While the online anonymous
marketplace, like Silk Road, has attracted a large number of
buyers and sellers since 2011 [49], [50], “traditional” channels
that are more “friendly” to general web users like forums [51],
spam [52], and Blackhat SEO [43] are still playing important
roles in the underground economy, especially in the regions
outside of western countries [53], [54], [55]. To skip under the
radar of legal authorities or security companies, the adversaries
are constantly inventing new terms or obfuscating existing terms
for communication. However, our work shows such terms can
be effectively captured by their associated search results, even
without understanding their semantic meanings.
Retroﬁtting search engine for detection. Previous works
have demonstrated that search engines are helpful in detecting
compromised and malicious sites. Invernizzi et al. proposed
EvilSeed which automatically generates search queries by
analyzing the seeding malicious web pages and the probability
of ﬁnding malicious sites can be signiﬁcantly increased [28].
Liao et al. studied promotional infection, an attack that injects
advertising content into compromised sites [56]. Their study
shows the semantics of the injected pages vastly differs from
the semantics of hosting sites’ sponsored top-level domains
(sTLD). By querying the terms irrelevant to sTLD semantics,
the promotional infection can be spotted effectively. Zhang et
al. utilized search engine visibility (whether the site is indexed)
as a factor to determine the maliciousness of a site [57]. In
this work, we showed that the indexed pages of search engines
can be used to discover trending terms used in underground
markets. Such direction has never been explored before.
Search query abuse. While the public interface offered by
search engines allows the security practitioners to discover
sites involved by hackers, it unfortunately gives the hackers
a lift to identify their targets. One common type of search
query abuse is “Google Dork Query” [58], which models the
ﬁngerprint of a website and is submitted by attackers to harvest
the URLs of websites built on top of speciﬁc website templates
(e.g., querying “Powered by WordPress” returns a list of sites
developed with WordPress [59]). As a ﬂurry of vulnerabilities
have been discovered on website templates, the adversary is
able to ﬁnd vulnerable sites and craft relevant exploits more
easily through this method. Although many Google Dorks have
been published (e.g., exploit-db.com [60]), the study by
Zhang et al. [61] showed that only a handful of them were
frequently exploited. Toffalini et al. [62] characterized the
known dorks and showed dorks can be created in an automated
fashion. Adversaries also leverage bot clients to send search
queries at large volume to identify vulnerable site, harvest
emails and scrape content from websites [63]. Black keywords
and Google Dorks are both considered harmful by search
engines but detecting the prior one is much more challenging,
as there is no public reference for the ever-changing vocabulary
and it is hard to analyze them using classic models like NLP.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Black keywords are frequently used for communication by
underground economy while escaping from being tracked by
law enforcement or being regulated by search engines. But
capturing these black keywords are rather difﬁcult, because
they are quickly evolved and artiﬁcially obfuscated. In this
work, we present the ﬁrst approach towards detecting black
keywords automatically. Our approach looks into the search
results and uses several search engine features to determine
their labels (black or not). By running our system, more than
400K black keywords were discovered and we found many
keywords previously unknown to the public, indicating this
approach is highly effective.
We believe our approach suggests a new direction in tackling
security problems deemed hard by conventional approaches,
like traditional NLP. In the future, we will go forth on this
direction and explore the area of translating black keywords,
which we think is feasible through big-data analytics.
In the
short term, we will collaborate with search engines and online
communities, like Baidu, to build additional defense against
illegal promotion by the underground economy.
