# False-Positive and False-Negative Rates for Skin Conductance and Voice Combined

## Introduction
This section presents the false-positive and false-negative rates for cryptographic key generation using skin conductance (SC) and voice. The results are analyzed to understand the trade-offs between different parameters, such as the threshold \( t \) and the scaling factor \( k \). The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these biometric signals in generating secure and usable keys.

## Figures and Analysis

### Figure 10: False-Positive and False-Negative Rates for Voice Combined with Skin Conductance

**Figure 10(a): e1**
- **Threshold (t)**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, SC
- **Scaling Factor (k)**: 1.25, 1.375, 1.5, 1.625, 1.75, 1.875
- **False-Positive Rate**: Higher for lower values of \( k \)
- **False-Negative Rate**: Lower for higher values of \( k \)

**Figure 10(b): e2**
- **Threshold (t)**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, SC
- **Scaling Factor (k)**: 1.25, 1.375, 1.5, 1.625, 1.75, 1.875
- **False-Positive Rate**: Lower for higher values of \( k \)
- **False-Negative Rate**: Higher for lower values of \( k \)

### Figure 9: False-Positive and False-Negative Rates for Skin Conductance

**Figure 9(a): e1**
- **Threshold (t)**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, SC
- **Scaling Factor (k)**: 1.25, 1.375, 1.5, 1.625, 1.75, 1.875
- **False-Positive Rate**: Higher for lower values of \( k \)
- **False-Negative Rate**: Lower for higher values of \( k \)

**Figure 9(b): e2**
- **Threshold (t)**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, SC
- **Scaling Factor (k)**: 1.25, 1.375, 1.5, 1.625, 1.75, 1.875
- **False-Positive Rate**: Lower for higher values of \( k \)
- **False-Negative Rate**: Higher for lower values of \( k \)

### Observations
- **e1 vs. e2**: The false-positive and false-negative rates are higher for e1 compared to e2. This is attributed to the lower intensity of some horror videos, which did not significantly change the skin conductance for many users.
- **Trade-off**: Increasing \( k \) from 1.25 to 1.875 generally decreases the false-negative rate but increases the false-positive rate. For example, in e2, with \( k = 1.25 \) and \( t_{SC} = 2.1 \), the false-positive rate is 3.2% and the false-negative rate is 2.2%.

## Combining Voice and Skin Conductance

- **Training and Evaluation**: The system is trained with a dataset \( \xi_{\text{train}}^{e2n} \) and evaluated against three different datasets to assess the false-positive and false-negative rates.
- **Results**: Cryptographic keys generated from voice and SC are effective in fighting coercion attacks. False-positive rates range from 6% to 15% for \( 1 \leq t_{SC} \leq 4 \), rising to 22% for \( t_{SC} \geq 5 \). False-negative rates are between 0% and 4.5% for all values of \( t_{SC} \).

## Advanced Attacks and Password Space

### Change in Password Space

- **Threat Model**: An attacker with access to lookup tables \( T_V \) and \( T_{SC} \), recorded spoken passwords, and skin conductance data can use association rule mining to reduce the password space.
- **Database D**: Contains mappings of SC feature keys when users are normal and stressed. Table 3 shows a sample database for \( |A| \) users.
- **Password Space Reduction**: In the worst case, the effective number of bits to represent the password space reduces by about 20%, but many threshold settings result in only a 10% reduction.

### Sedative Attack

- **Scenario**: An attacker makes the user take a sedative to relieve anxiety before capturing SC. This remains a future work to study the correlation between normal and sedated SC.

## Conclusion and Future Work

- **Novel Approach**: This paper presents a novel method for fighting coercion attacks using SC and voice to generate cryptographic keys.
- **User Study**: The model was tested with 39 users' data, showing that keys generated in different emotional states are distinct.
- **Future Work**: Further research is needed to reduce false-positive and false-negative rates and to explore the impact of sedatives on SC.

By analyzing these results, we aim to improve the security and usability of biometric-based cryptographic key generation systems.
