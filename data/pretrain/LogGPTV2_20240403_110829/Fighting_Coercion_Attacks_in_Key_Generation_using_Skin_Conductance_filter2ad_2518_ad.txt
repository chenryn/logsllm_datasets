Figure 9: False-positive and false-negative rates for skin
conductance
Note that the false-positive and false-negative rates are
higher for e1 in Figure 9(a). We believe, this is because
of the reason that the intensity of some of the horror
videos was not very high, which did not result in a no-
ticeable change in the skin conductance for many users.
We can observe the tradeoff of various settings of k
and the threshold from these ﬁgures.
In general, this
shows that whenever a user is under stress, her skin con-
ductance can be used to differentiate between the two
emotional state with good accuracy. For example in e2,
when k = 1.25 and tSC = 2.1, we obtained a false-
positive rate of 3.2% and a false-negative rate of 2.2%
(see Figure 9(b)). If we increase the value of k from 1.25
to 1.875 in both Figures 9(a) and 9(b), we could see
a decrease in the false-negative rates (increasing usabil-
ity) and increase in the false-positive rates (compromis-
ing with the security). We used the hamming distance
parameter d = 2 in our setting.
Voice combined with skin conductance Voice and
skin conductance samples are combined as shown in Fig-
ure 7 to obtain the samples needed in this evaluation.
We ﬁrst train the system with ξtrain
e2n , and then evaluate
the system against three different datasets to evaluate the
false-positive and false-negative rates.
These results show that generating cryptographic keys
from voice and skin conductance is effective in ﬁghting
coercion attacks, as we observe false-positive rates be-
tween 6% to 15% for 1 ≤ tSC ≤ 4, which can also
rise up to 22% for tSC ≥ 5. False-negative rates are
between 0% and 4.5% for all values of tSC . Further ef-
forts are needed to reduce the false-positive and false-
negative rates. Same as in the previous subsection, if we
increase the value of k from 1.25 to 1.875, we could see
a decrease in the false-negative rates and increase in the
false-positive rates.
6.3 Change in password space
In this subsection, we discuss more advanced attacks on
our system (if implemented) beside forcing the victim
to obtain her spoken password and skin conductance. If
such system is implemented, then we need to approx-
imate the entropy in the worst case of these advanced
attacks, in which the attacker makes use of the group in-
formation about the skin conductance and information
stored in the key generation module.
The group information about skin conductance refers
to the patterns observed in the change in the users’
feature key generated from the skin conductance (bSC)
when they are coerced. An attacker could use this in-
formation to selectively modify the victims skin conduc-
tance feature key in order to improve the probability of
generating the correct key. To know how we obtained the
feature key (bSC) for SC, see section 4.
Although we do not store any biometric information
of the user directly on the device (see discussions in
Section 4), we still need to store the lookup tables (TV
and TSC) which are derived from the user speciﬁc data
(e.g., feature descriptors). Although this table can be en-
crypted with a user password as discussed in previous
work [24], however we try not to rely the security of our
model on the secrecy of this table because we are dealing
with coercion attacks. In the rest of this subsection, we
assume that an attacker has perfect knowledge in both
the group information about skin conductance and the
lookup tables. We want to approximate the guessing en-
tropy, i.e., the reduction in the password space for this
more powerful attacker.
More precisely, we assume in the worst case that an
attacker has access to
• the lookup tables TV and TSC;
• the recorded spoken password of the user and the
corresponding feature key {bV (i)};
• the recorded skin conductance when the user
is stressed and the corresponding feature key
{bS
SC(i)};
• the database D which contains the mapping of the
SC(i)})
SC(i)})
SC feature keys when users are normal ({bN
to the scenario when they are stressed ({bS
for all users in a population A.
A sample database D for such mapping of SC is shown
in Table 3 for |A| users. Each row in the table is a
record of the feature key of a user when she is normal
and stressed, and the last column shows the index of the
feature keys that had changed from bN
SC to bS
SC.

The attacker’s strategy would be to analyze D to learn
SC} changes
SC}, e.g., whenever the i-th index of the feature key
patterns in which people’s feature keys {bN
to {bS
changes, the j-th one will change too.
These patterns can be easily learned by applying a well
studied technique called association rule mining [2]. The
attacker can then use these patterns to reduce the pass-
word space. Here, we use a simple example to demon-
strate the idea.
We ﬁrst represent the password space by a sequence of
0’s (the corresponding index in {bS
SC} will deﬁnitely not
change when a user’s emotional status changes), 1’s (the
corresponding index in {bS
SC} will deﬁnitely change),
and ∗’s (don’t know), e.g., [1, ∗, ∗] represents a password
space in which only the ﬁrst index of {bS
SC} will change,
and therefore the password space is 22 = 4. When the at-
tacker makes use of a pattern learned, e.g., “the change of
the ﬁrst index of {bS
SC} implies the change of the second
one”, he can convert the password space from [1, ∗, ∗]
to [1, 1, ∗], since the second index of the {bS
SC} will deﬁ-
nitely change, too. With this, the password space reduces
to 21 = 2.
We present the detailed algorithm with an example in
estimating this reduction in the password space in the
Appendix A.
We constructed the database D with the skin conduc-
tance samples collected in our user study, mine all as-
sociation rules, and then use the above algorithm to ﬁnd
out the change in the password space. Figure 11 shows
the results for different settings of the threshold and min-
imum conﬁdence in the association rule mining.
k is set to 1.25 in this experiment, and the minimum sup-
port is set to 30%. Note that the original password space
is 2mSC = 250. Although in the worst case the effective
number of bits to represent the password space reduces

Another way to attack our system is to make the user
take a sedative to relieve his/her anxiety before capturing
SC. The attacker can then use this skin conductance to
generate the key. We are trying to collaborate with med-
ical practitioners and researchers to see the correlation
between the two skin conductances, one under normal
condition without taking any sedative and the other un-
der coercion and having taken the sedative. For now this
remains as a future work.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we present a novel approach for ﬁghting
against coercion attacks in generating cryptographic keys
using skin conductance (SC) of a person.
In coercion
attack, the attacker forces a user to grant him access
to the system. SC was used to determine the person’s
overall arousal state i.e. (emotional status). The change
in the emotional status of a person results in different
keys. We discussed the reasons of adopting SC as an
emotional response parameter and why it was preferred
over other physiological signals like Electrocardiogra-
phy, Electromyography, Heart Rate, respiration, skin
temperature etc. In this paper, we have chosen skin con-
ductance along with voice in generating cryptographic
keys; however, one can choose any other biometric for
e.g. iris, ﬁngerprint, face etc. in lieu of voice. Crypto-
graphic key is generated using lookup table method as
discussed in [24].
In our knowledge the presented work is the ﬁrst in
ﬁghting coercion attacks in generating cryptographic
keys. We conducted two experiments in our user study
and have shown some interesting results. The proposed
model was tested with 39 user’s voice and skin con-
ductance data to compute the false-positive and false-
negative rate. Furthermore our results showed that the
cryptographic key generated in two different scenarios
14
are different for the same person. This bolsters our
heuristic to use skin conductance for ﬁghting against co-
ercion attacks. As both skin conductance and voice are
not static biometrics, in some cases we obtained high
false-negatives. We evaluated the security of the pro-
posed model in terms of entropy and several threat mod-
els and discussed how difﬁcult it is for an attacker, in an
event when she has full information about the key gener-
ation module; the skin conductance of the victim in the
stressful scenario; and the group information about the
skin conductance.
Note that guessing entropy and guessing distance [5]
might provide deeper insight in the security of our model.
