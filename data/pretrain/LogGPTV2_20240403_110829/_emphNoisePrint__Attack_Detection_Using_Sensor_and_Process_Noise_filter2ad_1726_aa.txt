ABSTRACT
An attack detection scheme is proposed to detect data integrity
attacks on sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). A combined
fingerprint for sensor and process noise is created during the nor-
mal operation of the system. Under sensor spoofing attack, noise
pattern deviates from the fingerprinted pattern enabling the pro-
posed scheme to detect attacks. To extract the noise (difference
between expected and observed value) a representative model of
the system is derived. A Kalman filter is used for the purpose of
state estimation. By subtracting the state estimates from the real
system states, a residual vector is obtained. It is shown that in steady
state the residual vector is a function of process and sensor noise.
A set of time domain and frequency domain features is extracted
from the residual vector. Feature set is provided to a machine learn-
ing algorithm to identify the sensor and process. Experiments are
performed on two testbeds, a real-world water treatment (SWaT) fa-
cility and a water distribution (WADI) testbed. A class of zero-alarm
attacks, designed for statistical detectors on SWaT are detected by
the proposed scheme. It is shown that a multitude of sensors can
be uniquely identified with accuracy higher than 90% based on the
noise fingerprint.

1 INTRODUCTION
A Cyber Physical System (CPS) is a combination of computing
elements and physical phenomenon [8, 39]. In particular we will
consider examples of water treatment and distribution plants in
this paper, also known as Industrial Control Systems (ICS) [29].
An ICS consists of cyber components such as Programmable Logic
Controllers (PLCs), sensors, actuators, Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) workstation, and Human Machine Inter-
face (HMI) elements interconnected via a communications network.
The PLCs control a physical process based on the sensor data via a
SCADA workstation. The advances in communication technologies
resulted in widespread of such system to better monitor and operate
ICS, but this connectivity also exposes physical processes to mali-
cious entities on the cyber domain. Recent incidents of sabotage
on these systems [13, 20, 48], have raised concerns on the security
of CPS [12].
Challenges in CPS security are different as compared with con-
ventional IT systems, especially in terms of consequences in case
of a security lapse. Attacks on CPS might result in damage to the
physical property, as a result of an explosion [16, 56] or severely
affecting people who depend on a critical infrastructure as was the
case of recent power cutoff in Ukraine [13]. Data integrity is an
important security requirement for CPS [24] therefore, integrity of
sensor data should be ensured. Sensor data can either be spoofed in
cyber (digital) domain [52] or in physical (analog) domain [47, 49].
Sensors are a bridge between the physical and cyber domains in a
CPS. Traditionally, an intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors
a communication network or a computing host to detect attacks.
However, physical tampering with sensors or sensor spoofing in
physical/analog domain, may go undetected by the legacy IDS [47].
Data integrity attacks on sensor measurement and impact of
such attacks have been studied in theory, including false data in-
jection [34], replay attacks [33], and stealthy attacks [17]. These

tem model and statistical fault detectors [3, 5, 37, 38] and also point
out the limitations of such fault detectors against an adversarial
manipulation of the sensor data. In practice attacks on sensor mea-
surement can be launched by analog spoofing attacks [28, 47, 57]),
or by tampering with the communication channel between a sensor
and a controller by means of a classical Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM)
attack [52].
The proposed scheme serves as a device identification framework
and it can also detect a range of attacks on sensors. The proposed
attack detection framework improves on the limitations of model
based attack detection schemes. In general for a complex CPS there
can be many possible attack scenarios. However zero-alarm attack
is a worst case scenario for a model based attack detection method
employing a threshold based detector. A zero-alarm attack exposes
the limitations of threshold based statistical attack detection meth-
ods. To be fair while making comparison, we choose the same attack
vector namely zero-alarm attack. Another important thing is that
the input to NoisePrint and reference methods is the same, i.e. a
residual vector. We also executed bias attack as an example of an
attack which can be detected using CUSUM and Bad-Data detec-
tors. The proposed scheme is a non-intrusive sensor and process
fingerprinting method to authenticate sensors transmitting mea-
surements to one or more PLCs. To apply this method we need to
extract noise pattern, for which system model of an ICS is used.
This scheme intelligently uses model of the system in a novel way
to extract noise pattern and then input that noise to NoisePrint as
shown in Figure 1. The input to NoisePrint block is a function of
sensor and process noise. Sensor noise is due to construction of
the sensor and process noise due to variations in the process e.g.
fluid sloshing in a storage tank in a process plant. Sensor noise is
different from one sensor to another because of hardware imper-
fections during the manufacturing process [19]. Process noise is
unique among different processes essentially because of different
process dynamics. Sensor and process noise can be captured using
a real system state (from sensor measurements) and system state
estimate (from system model). These noise variations affect each
device and process differently and thus are hard to control or re-
produce [23] making physical or digital spoofing of sensor noise
profiles challenging.
A technique, referred to as NoisePrint, is designed to fingerprint
sensor and process found in ICS. NoisePrint creates a noise finger-
print based on a set of time domain and frequency domain features
that are extracted from the sensor and process noise. To extract
noise pattern a system model based method is used. A two-class
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to identify each sensor from
a dataset, comprising of a multitude of industrial sensors. According
to the ground truth one class is labeled as legitimate sensor/process
and other class of illegitimate data (including attacks and data from
rest of the sensors in the plant). Experiments are performed on two
operational water treatment and distribution facilities accessible
for research [6, 31]. A class of attacks as explained in threat model
are launched on a real water treatment testbed and results are
compared with reference statistical methods. Sensor identification
accuracy is observed to be as high as 96%, and at least 90% for a
range of sensors.
The major contributions of this work are thus:
2
• A novel fingerprinting framework that is based on sensor and
process noise, and is a function of hardware characteristics
of a device and Physics of the process.
• A detailed evaluation of the proposed NoisePrint as attack
• Extensive empirical performance evaluation on realistic testbeds.
• A comparison of the performance of the proposed scheme
with the reference statistical detectors.
• A detailed evaluation of the proposed NoisePrint as a device
detection method, for a class of sensor spoofing attacks.
identification method in a complex CPS.
This work evaluates NoisePrint in the context of water treatment
and water distribution testbeds [6, 31]. Commonly found industrial
sensors are studied, but without loss of generality, the analysis is
applicable to other industrial applications.
2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND ATTACK
DETECTION
In this section we will explain the overview of the proposed scheme.
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed scheme.
(cid:40)
2.1 System Dynamics
In Figure 1, the first block represents data collection step from
the real water testbeds. A linear time invariant system model is
obtained using either first principles (laws of Physics) or subspace
system identification techniques. Then, we construct a Kalman filter
which is used to obtain estimates for the system states and to find
the residual vector. We studied the system design and functionality
of the water treatment (SWaT) testbed [31] to obtain the system
model. For the water distribution (WADI) testbed, we used data
collected under regular operation (no attacks) and subspace system
identification techniques [40] to obtain a system model. For both
testbeds, resulting system models are Linear Time Invariant (LTI)
discrete time state space model of the form:
xk +1 = Axk + Buk + vk ,
yk = Cxk + ηk .
(1)
At the time-instants k ∈ N, the output of the process yk is sam-
pled and transmitted over a communication channel as shown in Fig-
ure 2. The control action uk is computed based on the received sen-
sor measurement ¯yk. Data is exchanged between different entities
of this control loop and it is transmitted via communication chan-
nels. There are many potential points where an attacker can hack
into the system. For instance, Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks at
the communication channels and physical attacks directly on the
infrastructure. In this paper, we focus on sensor spoofing attacks,
which could be accomplished through a Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM)
scheme [52] or a replacement of on board PLC software [15, 22, 25].
After each transmission and reception, the attacked output ¯yk takes
the form:
(2)
where δk ∈ Rm denotes sensor attacks. Throughout this paper,
we reserve the variable k as the discrete-time index of various
sequences; where clear, we omit reminding the reader that k ∈ N.
¯yk := yk + δk = Cxk + ηk + δk ,

2.2 Kalman Filter
We used Kalman filter to estimate the state of the system based on
the available output yk,
ˆxk +1 = Aˆxk + Buk + Lk
ek +1 =(cid:0)A − LkC(cid:1)ek − Lkηk − Lk δk + vk .
(3)
with estimated state ˆxk ∈ Rn, ˆx1 = E[x(t1)], where E[·] denotes
expectation, and gain matrix Lk ∈ Rn×m. Define the estimation
error ek := xk − ˆxk. In the Kalman filter, the matrix Lk is designed
to minimize the covariance matrix Pk := E[ek eT
k ] (in the absence of
attacks). Given the system model (1),(2) and the estimator (3), the
estimation error is governed by the following difference equation
(4)
If the pair (A, C) is detectable, the covariance matrix converges
to steady state in the sense that limk→∞ Pk = P exists [10]. We
assume that the system has reached steady state before an attack
occurs. Then, the estimation of the random sequence xk , k ∈ N can
be obtained by the estimator (3) with Pk and Lk in steady state. It
can be verified that, if R2 + CPCT is positive definite, the following
estimator gain
Lk = L :=(cid:0)APCT(cid:1)(cid:0)R2 + CPCT(cid:1)−1
(5)
leads to the minimal steady state covariance matrix P, with P given
by the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation:
APAT − P + R1 = APCT (R2 + CPCT )−1
(6)
The reconstruction method given by (3)-(6) is referred to as the
steady state Kalman Filter, cf. [10].

2.3 Attack Detection Framework
In this section, we explain the details of the proposed attack detec-
tion scheme. First, we discuss the Kalman filter based state estima-
tion and residual generation. Then, we present the design of our
residual-based fingerprinting method (namely NoisePrint).

Lηk−i−1), where vk ∈ Rn is the process noise and ηk ∈ Rm is the
sensor noise.
