ABSTRACT
In the last two decades, the communication technologies used for
supervision and control of critical infrastructures such as the power
grid, have been migrating from serial links to Internet-compatible
network protocols. Despite this trend, the research community
has not explored or measured the unique characteristics of these
industrial systems, and as a result, most of these networks remain
unstudied. In this paper we perform the first measurement study of
a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) network in
the bulk power grid. We develop a new protocol parser that can be
used to analyze packets not conforming to standards, find attributes
to profile the SCADA network, and identify several outliers which
underscore the difficulties in managing a federated network where
different devices are under the control of different power companies.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the past two decades, long-distance communications in Super-
visory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have mi-
grated from dedicated serial links, to Internet-compatible networks.
Therefore, SCADA communication standards for serial links (such
as Modbus, and IEC 60870-5-101) have been updated to support
TCP/IP networks (e.g., Modbus/TCP and IEC 60870-5-104).
While modern SCADA systems use Internet-compatible proto-
cols, the network measurement research community has largely
ignored these networks. One of the reasons is that companies that
manage critical infrastructures, such as power grids, are very con-
servative in allowing outsiders to gain access to their internal net-
works. As a consequence, most of the published research related
to SCADA networks has relied on simulations and testbeds [14, 17,
20, 23, 25, 26], and are not based on operational systems. The few
studies of a real-world power grid consider only the small distri-
bution system [10]; as far as we are aware, there is no published
measurement study of the networks used in the core part of the
power grid, the so called bulk power system. These networks are
interesting not only because they operate the most critical compo-
nent of the power grid, but also because they consist of multiple
power companies (with different administrative domains) talking to
each other’s equipment (in contrast, most other SCADA networks
operate within a single administrative domain [5, 10, 19]).
Our contributions include,
• As far as we are aware, we are the first to measure and
characterize the SCADA network of the bulk power system.
• In particular, we study the IEC 104 SCADA protocol for
Automatic Generation Control (AGC) in the bulk power grid.
IEC 104 is one of the SCADA protocols attacked during the
Ukraine power outages in 2016 [13].
• We study the network with three different approaches: (1)
traffic analysis of TCP flows, bandwidth used, and timing
characteristics of the packets, (2) analysis of the types of IEC
104 messages exchanged with the help of Markov networks,
and (3) analysis of the physical measurements and control
commands sent between substations and the control center.
• While overall SCADA networks are more stable and pre-
dictable than general computer networks, we still find that
because of the federated nature of the network we study (de-
vices under different administrative domains), our network
has more interesting behaviors than other SCADA networks.

• We also find evidence of the challenges to upgrade legacy
protocols to new standards. In particular we find some non-
compliant communications based on IEC 104, and upon fur-
ther inspection, we identify that these non-standard packets
are an attempt to support legacy protocols over TCP/IP.
• In order to understand these non-compliant packets we de-
veloped a new IEC 104 parser that we made available to the
research community [21].
We believe these observations are an important first step to under-
stand industrial networks and their unique characteristics.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
gives a general overview of the Bulk Power System. Section 3 details
related works. Section 4 describes IEC 104. Section 5 summarizes
of our datasets and the network we study. Section 6 focuses on our
traffic analysis. Finally, Section 7 concludes our work.

localized outage (e.g., a blackout in a neighborhood) lasting only a
couple of hours. Fig. 1 and Table 1 illustrate the differences in scale
between transmission and distribution networks.
The bulk power grid is operated by several companies, some of
them are electricity generators while others operate a subsection
of the transmission system. Each of these companies has their own
SCADA system to monitor and control the part of the bulk power
grid they are responsible for. Orchestrating the operation of all of
these power companies is an entity called system operator. In
Europe, these operators are called Transmission System Operators
(TSO) and there is usually one TSO per country. In the U.S. system
operators are called either Regional Transmission Operators (RTO)
or Independent System Operators (ISO) depending on whether they
administer the power grid among several states (RTO) or if they
operate the grid in one state (ISO). For example, the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO) operates the power grid for
all of the state of California.
Figure 1: Illustration of the differences between the trans-
mission and distribution systems in a country. While the
transmission system (i.e., the bulk power system) is a re-
dundant network covering a large geographical area, distri-
bution systems are independent radial networks covering
small geographical areas.
The power grid has three major parts: (1) generation, (2) trans-
mission, and (3) distribution. Electric power is generated wher-
ever it is convenient and economical, and then it is transmitted at
high voltages (100kV-500kV) through the transmission network.
The transmission system is an interconnected, redundant network
that spans large regions (usually one country). Large generation
plants and the transmission network (the first two parts of the
power grid) are usually referred to as the Bulk Power System,
and this bulk power system is responsible for the reliable delivery
of electricity to large areas. A disruption in the bulk power grid can
cause a country-level blackout lasting for several days. In contrast,
distribution systems are much smaller, their networks are radial
(non-redundant), and a failure in their system usually causes only a
Figure 2: A system operator has to interface with substa-
tions controlled by different transmission systems and gen-
erators, and as a result the network behavior is more diverse
than previously considered.
One of the essential tasks of the bulk system operator is to coor-
dinate the power balance across multiple geographical regions and
to maintain the frequency of the system at the desired set point (e.g.,
60Hz in the U.S.). To achieve this, they use an algorithm called Au-
tomatic Generation Control (AGC) which asks different electric
generation companies to ramp up or slow down their electricity
generation to maintain an adequate power flow balance in the sys-
tem, and thus satisfy the reliability and market efficiency of the
electric power system. AGC uses as primary inputs the frequency
of the power grid and the power flow at different power exchange
lines.

Because these bulk system operators have to collect sensor data
and send control commands to various other companies operat-
ing the power grid, they form federated SCADA networks, where
devices in the network are owned and maintained different ad-
ministrative authorities. Fig. 2 illustrates this setting, where at the
bottom of the figure we can see the SCADA system of each of the
local operators (transmission companies, and large generation com-
panies) and at the top we see how the SCADA system of the system
operator connects to the substations of the other companies. The
top SCADA system is the one we study in this paper.
telecontrol messages between control stations (e.g., SCADA cen-
ters) and outstations (e.g., devices in substations such as Remote
Terminal Units (RTU)) via a permanently connected communica-
tion link over the telephone network i.e., modem circuit. With the
prevalence of TCP/IP networks, it became apparent that SCADA
systems needed to adapt their protocols to these networks. There-
fore in 2000, IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) was introduced as a way
to transport IEC 101 telecontrol messages over TCP/IP using port
2404. IEC 104 encapsulates modified IEC 101 telecontrol messages
into a TCP packet.
3 RELATED WORK
Previous measurement studies of computer networks related to the
power grid fall into three categories: (1) use of emulated/simulated
networks (i.e., confined to a laboratory environment, or a testbed);
(2) insufficient details of the system and network; (3) study a rela-
tively small part of an operational power grid system, i.e., distribu-
tion networks.
Analysing emulated or simulated data is the most popular ap-
proach, as researchers can configure their equipment however they
want. This line of work includes a testbed at KTH [17, 25] simu-
lated IEC 104 networks [14] or emulated IEC 104 networks through
Qtester [20].
Some papers study operational power grids, but they do not
give details of the system under study. For example, Yang et al.
[29] capture network traffic data from a real-world IEC 104 system
without adding details of the system they are analyzing. Similarly
Wressnegger et al. [28] indicate that their network capture comes
from a power plant, but they do not specify which network protocol
is used or add any details of the network.
Perhaps the work most closely related to ours is Formby et
al. [9, 10] and Irvene et al. [15], where they analyze a real-world
electric power distribution substation that uses the DNP3 industrial
control protocol. Both of these works study the same distribution
system, which is a relatively small component of the power grid.
In contrast, our dataset is captured from a Bulk Power System,
which as we discussed before, is the core component of large-scale
power systems. In addition, our dataset includes data used for Auto-
matic Generation Control (AGC) and focuses on the IEC 104 SCADA
protocol, which recently gained more visibility as the target of the
attacks in Ukraine [13].
More importantly, our dataset includes network traffic not only
from a single power operator but rather, from a regional power
balancing authority. The balancing authority coordinates multiple
power operators over a broad geographical area serving a popu-
lation of about 40 million people. In addition, our data captures
were obtained in two different years, giving us the unique ability
to compare the changes and similarities of the network over longer
periods of time when compared to previous work. In particular, this
paper extends our preliminary results [18] by providing an in-depth
look at the network characteristics and dynamics of bulk power
systems controlling power generators in a wide area network.

IEC 60870-5-101 (IEC 101) [6] was originally developed by the In-
ternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1995 and was
amended in 2000 and 2001 to provide a standard that enables basic

Figure 3: IEC 104 APDU Octets Structure
The TCP payload of an IEC 104 packet contains one or more
Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs). The first part of the
APDU is called the Application Protocol Control Information
(APCI), which acts as the header of the message, and the second
part is called the Application Service Data Unit (ASDU)–this
second part carries the sensor values and control messages between
RTUs and control servers. APCI and ASDU fields are shown in Fig. 3.
There are three types of APDUs:
I-Format APDUs are used to carry sensor and control data
between endpoints. ASDUs are composed by a Data Unit
Identifier (DUI) and by Information Objects (IO) as illus-
trated in Fig. 3. Each IO represents a specific device in the
field which is associated to a unique address called Informa-
tion Object Address (IOA). The first ASDU octet is Type
Identification (typeID) which defines the exact data format
or command type that follows. For example, "Measured value,
short floating point number", or "Set point command, scaled
value". IEC 101 defines 127 TypeIDs from which IEC 104
