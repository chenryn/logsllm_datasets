User: I have installed manually python (2.7.3). Whoc do I update the rpm version
usr/bin/python -V:
Python 2.7.3
rpm -qf /usr/bin/python:
python-2.6.5-3.el6.x86_64
any suggestions?
linux version: RH6.3
Assistant: You installed it incorrectly. Instead of make install you should run make altinstall. This will install the new version of Python parallel to existing versions, and create a new executable in $PREFIX/bin with the name of python followed by the minor version of Python installed, e.g. python2.7.
