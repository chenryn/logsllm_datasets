Assistant: 1. Adopt IaaS and PaaS services: Enterprises can use infrastructure and platform services provided by cloud computing, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and other services, to improve the utilization of their IT resources. 2. Application elastic expansion: Cloud computing can help enterprises adjust their IT resources in real time according to their needs. Enterprises can quickly expand the deployment according to demand, and it only takes a few minutes to spin up new servers on the cloud and expand applications. In this way, customer needs can be met more quickly, and unnecessary waste of resources can also be avoided. 3. Mobile work and data sharing: By using cloud computing, enterprises can store data and applications on the cloud, so that they can be accessed through the network anytime and anywhere. This can greatly facilitate the mobile work of enterprises and improve work efficiency. 4. Backup, recovery and disaster recovery: Cloud computing can also help enterprises improve their backup and recovery capabilities. Businesses can back up their data to the cloud for quick recovery in case of disaster. This can help businesses reduce the risk of data loss while also enhancing business continuity. 5. Reduce hardware purchase and maintenance costs: Cloud computing can also help enterprises reduce hardware purchase and maintenance costs. The cloud service provider will be responsible for hardware maintenance and upgrades, and the enterprise only needs to pay for the service fee. 6. Shared hardware resources: Cloud computing can help enterprises run different businesses on the same hardware, which can better share hardware resources and reduce hardware costs. At the same time, it can also reduce the hardware failure rate and improve business stability. In conclusion, cloud computing can help enterprises improve IT resource utilization and efficiency while reducing costs. Enterprises should adopt corresponding cloud computing solutions according to their business needs in order to better utilize the advantages of cloud computing.
