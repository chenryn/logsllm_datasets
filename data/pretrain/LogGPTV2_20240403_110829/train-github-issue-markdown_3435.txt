I am encountering issues with the new version of Glide 4.3. The application crashes whenever I use Glide, regardless of the context I pass to it.

The error message I receive is as follows:
```java
java.lang.AbstractMethodError: abstract method "void com.bumptech.glide.module.RegistersComponents.registerComponents(android.content.Context, com.bumptech.glide.Glide, com.bumptech.glide.Registry)"
```

Here is the code I have tried:

```java
Glide.with(getApplicationContext())
     .load(url)
     .into(imageView);
```

And also:

```java
Glide.with(getContext())
     .load(url)
     .into(imageView);
```

Additionally, I receive the following warning:
```
W/Glide: Failed to find GeneratedAppGlideModule. You should include an annotationProcessor compile dependency on com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler in your application and a @GlideModule annotated AppGlideModule implementation or LibraryGlideModules will be silently ignored.
```

My `build.gradle` file includes the following dependencies for Glide:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.3.1'
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.3.1'
}
```

I have also posted this issue on Stack Overflow for further assistance.
