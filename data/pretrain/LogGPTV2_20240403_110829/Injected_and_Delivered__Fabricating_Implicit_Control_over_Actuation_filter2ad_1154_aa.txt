Abstract
Inertial sensors provide crucial feedback for control sys-
tems to determine motional status and make timely, auto-
mated decisions. Prior efforts tried to control the output
of inertial sensors with acoustic signals. However, their
approaches did not consider sample rate drifts in analog-
to-digital converters as well as many other realistic fac-
tors. As a result, few attacks demonstrated effective con-
trol over inertial sensors embedded in real systems.
This work studies the out-of-band signal injection
methods to deliver adversarial control
to embedded
MEMS inertial sensors and evaluates consequent vul-
nerabilities exposed in control systems relying on them.
Acoustic signals injected into inertial sensors are out-of-
band analog signals. Consequently, slight sample rate
drifts could be ampliﬁed and cause deviations in the fre-
quency of digital signals. Such deviations result in ﬂuc-
tuating sensor output; nevertheless, we characterize two
methods to control the output: digital amplitude adjust-
ing and phase pacing. Based on our analysis, we devise
non-invasive attacks to manipulate the sensor output as
well as the derived inertial information to deceive control
systems. We test 25 devices equipped with MEMS iner-
tial sensors and ﬁnd that 17 of them could be implicitly
controlled by our attacks. Furthermore, we investigate
the generalizability of our methods and show the pos-
sibility to manipulate the digital output through signals
with relatively low frequencies in the sensing channel.

Introduction
Sensing and actuation systems are entrusted with in-
creasing intelligence to perceive the environment and re-
act to it. Inertial sensors consisting of gyroscopes and
accelerometers measure angular velocities and linear ac-
celerations, which directly depict movements and orien-
tations of a device. Therefore, systems equipped with
inertial sensors are able to determine motional status and
make actuation decisions in a timely, automated manner.
While inertial sensing allows a control system to actuate
in response to environmental changes promptly, errors of
inertial measurements could result in instantaneous actu-
ations as well.
Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyro-
scopes are known to be susceptible to resonant acoustic
interferences [41, 44, 45, 75]. Son et al. showed that
a drone could be caused to crash by disturbing the gy-
roscope with intentional resonant sound [64]. Further-
more, Trippel et al. investigated the data integrity issue
of MEMS accelerometers under acoustic attacks [68].
While they gained adversarial control over exposed ac-
celerometers, few attacks demonstrated effective control
over embedded sensors. Thus, it remains unrevealed that
to what extent attackers could exploit embedded inertial
sensors and possibly control the systems relying on them.
To achieve adversarial control over inertial sensors
embedded in real systems, we need to consider several
realistic factors: (a) Attack setting. Biasing attacks in
[68] were conducted on exposed sensors connected to an
Arduino board, making the sampling process and real-
time sensor data accessible to attackers. In contrast, our
work studies non-invasive attacks, implying that attack-
ers cannot physically alter the system and can only infer
necessary information about the sensor from observable
phenomena. (b) Sample rate. The exact sample rate of
embedded sensors could be difﬁcult to access, and we
ﬁnd that slight drifts in the sample rate may cause trou-
bles to attackers. (c) Actuating direction. While Trippel
et al. [68] manipulated a smartphone controlled RC car
by inducing sensor outputs in only one direction, most
systems rely on inertial measurements in both directions
for control purposes. In this work, we develop general-
izable methods that could manipulate inertial measure-
ments of embedded sensors and trigger actuations of dif-
ferent kinds of control systems in both directions.
Acoustic signals injected at resonant frequencies of
inertial sensors are usually out-of-band signals, which

will be sampled by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
with an insufﬁcient sample rate. We characterize this
kind of attacks as out-of-band signal injections, present-
ing several important features: (1) Ampliﬁcation of sam-
ple rate drifts. We ﬁnd that tiny drifts in the sample rate
of an ADC could be ampliﬁed and cause more signif-
icant deviations in the frequency of the digital signal.
Consequently, it could be difﬁcult to induce and main-
tain a DC (Direct Current, 0 Hz) sensor output as in prior
work [68]. The resulting digital signal serves as noises
due to its oscillating nature; nevertheless, we perceive
following properties to control it. (2) Adjustable digital
amplitudes. Distortions caused by undersampling allow
amplitudes of different digital samples within one cycle
of oscillation adjustable. (3) Phase pacing. We ﬁnd that
a phase offset could be induced in the digital signal by
switching the frequency of out-of-band analog signals.
Based on our analysis, we develop non-invasive at-
tacks to manipulate the output of embedded inertial sen-
sors as well as the derived information to deceive dif-
ferent kinds of control systems. We evaluate our at-
tacks on 25 devices equipped with various models of
inertial sensors from different vendors. Our experi-
mental results show that 23 devices could be affected
by acoustic signals and 17 of them are susceptible to
implicit control. Our attack demonstrations include
maliciously actuating the motor of self-balancing hu-
man transporters, manipulating a user’s view in vir-
tual reality (VR) systems, spooﬁng a navigation system
(Google Maps), etc. We have uploaded the demos of our
proof-of-concept attacks at https://www.youtube.
com/channel/UCGMX3ZbElV7BZYIX7RtF5tg.
In summary, we list our contributions as follows:
• We devise two sets of novel spooﬁng attacks (Side-
Swing and Switching attacks) against embedded
MEMS inertial sensors to manipulate sensor outputs
and the derived inertial information. The attacks
are non-invasive and could deliver implicit control
to different kinds of real systems relying on inertial
sensors.
• We evaluate our attacks on 25 devices and ﬁnd
that 23 of them can be affected by acoustic sig-
nals, presenting different control levels. Our proof-
of-concept attacks demonstrate adversarial control
over self-balancing, aiming and stabilizing, motion
tracking and controlling, navigation systems, etc.
• We propose the out-of-band signal injection model
and methods to manipulate the oscillating digitized
signal when an analog signal is sampled with an in-
sufﬁcient sample rate. We investigate the general-
izability of our methods with a case study showing
that attackers could manipulate the oscillating dig-
itized signal by sending signals with relatively low
frequencies through a universal sensing channel.

Inertial Sensors in Control Systems
MEMS inertial sensors use mechanical structures to de-
tect inertial stimuli and generate electrical signals to de-
pict it. MEMS accelerometers detect linear accelera-
tions with a mass-spring structure. While MEMS gy-
roscopes use a similar structure to sense Coriolis accel-
erations aCor, an extra vibrating structure is used to drive
the sensing mass with a velocity v, which is orthogonal to
the sensing direction. The angular velocity ω causing the
Coriolis acceleration can be derived by: aCor = −2ω ×v.
Acoustic Injection. Although MEMS technology has
signiﬁcantly reduced the size, cost and power consump-
tion of inertial sensors,
the miniaturized mechanical
structure could suffer from resonant acoustic interfer-
ences. Acoustic signals at frequencies close to the natu-
ral frequency of the mechanical structure could force the
sensing mass into resonance. Displacements of the sens-
ing mass are usually measured by capacitive electrodes
and would induce electrical signals. The signal will then
be digitized by the ADC and could possibly inﬂuence the
control system, as shown in Figure 1.
Under resonance, the sensing mass is forced into vi-
brations at the same frequency as the external sinusoidal
driving force (sound pressure waves). Therefore, the
mass-spring structure of inertial sensors could serve as
a receiving system for resonant acoustic signals and al-
low attackers to inject analog signals at speciﬁc frequen-
cies. However, the ability of attackers towards adversar-
ial control is still restricted in two aspects: (1) Attackers
cannot inject arbitrary forms of analog signals. Since the
injected analog signal is caused by mechanical resonance
of the sensing mass, it would be a sinusoidal signal and
always presents an oscillating pattern. (2) The digital sig-
nal cannot be controlled directly. Attackers could only
induce speciﬁc digital signals by controlling the analog
signal. This process is difﬁcult to control especially in an
embedded environment with limited information.
Control System. MEMS inertial sensors provide crucial
feedback for control systems to make autonomous deci-

are very broad. Examples of these applications include
human transporters, kinetic devices, robots, pointing sys-
tems for antennas, navigation of autonomous (robotic)
vehicles, platform stabilization of heavy machinery, yaw
rate control of wind-power plants, industrial automa-
tion units, and guidance of low-end tactical applications
[55, 36, 58, 67]. Because of their ubiquitousness and
criticality in control systems, it is important to examine
MEMS inertial sensors’ reliability and evaluate the re-
silience of control systems under sensor spooﬁng attacks.
This work evaluates non-invasive spooﬁng attacks
against embedded MEMS inertial sensors on a wide
range of control systems in consumer applications. The
systems we investigate can be broadly divided into two
categories: (1) Closed-loop control systems. The sys-
tem continuously compares its current status with a goal
status and tries to diminish the difference between them
through actuations. (2) Open-loop control systems. The
system simply follows inertial sensing information to
make actuation decisions. Different instances of these
systems will be evaluated in Section 6.
3 Threat Model
The objective of attackers is to spoof embedded inertial
sensors and deliver adversarial control to the system. To
achieve this, attackers need to induce speciﬁc digital sig-
nals to trigger actuations in the control system.
Non-invasiveness. The spooﬁng attack against embed-
ded inertial sensors is non-invasive and can be imple-
mented without physical contact to the target device. At-
tackers cannot physically alter the hardware, neither can
they directly access or modify the sampling process as
well as the sensor output. However, we assume that at-
tackers can analyze the behavior of an identical device
under acoustic effects before a real attack.
Audibleness. The resonant frequencies of MEMS ac-
celerometers are usually within the range of human hear-
ing. However, the resonant frequencies of MEMS gyros
are often in the ultrasound band (above 20 kHz). There-
fore, acoustic signals used to attack gyros are inaudible.
While resonant frequencies of gyros in several devices
we test are between 19 to 20 kHz, they are still above the
audible range of most adults [66].
Sound Source. Attackers can use consumer-grade
speakers or transducers, directivity horns, and ampli-
ﬁers to generate sound waves. The signal source can be
a function generator, an Arduino board, or mini signal
generator boards [22, 24]. We assume that the possi-
ble attack distance is several meters; attackers have suf-
ﬁcient resources, i.e., techniques or fund, to optimize
the power, efﬁciency, directivity and emitting area of the
sound source. More capable attackers could use pro-
fessional acoustic devices or highly customized acoustic
ampliﬁcation techniques to further improve the range as
well as the effect of the attack.
4 Modeling and Analysis
In acoustic attacks, malicious analog signals injected into
the transducer will be processed and digitized before
reaching the control unit. Therefore, the effect of attacks
depends on the attacker’s ability to inﬂuence the digi-
tized signal. In this section, we analyze the digitization
process of out-of-band analog signals and propose gen-
eral methods to control the oscillating digitized signal.
4.1 Digitization of Out-of-band Signals
Since the sensing mass under resonance is oscillating at
the same frequency as sound waves, the resulting analog
signal can be described by,
V (t) = A· sin(2πFt + φ0)
(1)
where F is the frequency of resonant sound waves and
the amplitude A = A0kaks. A0 is the amplitude of sound
waves. The coefﬁcients ka and ks represent the attenua-
tion of acoustic energy during transmission and the sen-
sitivity of the mechanical sensing structure respectively.
This analog signal will then be sampled by the ADC. As-
suming FS is the sampling rate, and t0 = 0,t1 = 1
, ...,ti =
FS
i
FS
, ..., are sampling times, the digitized signal will be,
V [i] = A· sin(2πF i
FS
+ φ0)
(i ∈ {0,1,2,3, ...})
(2)
The frequency of analog signals injected through res-
onance is usually much higher than the sampling rate.
For instance, the typical resonant frequency is several
kHz for accelerometers and more than 19 kHz for gy-
ros, while the sample rate is usually in tens or hundreds.
According to the Nyquist theorem, when F > FS
2 , there
would be a problem of aliasing. We have,
F = n· FS + ε
2 FS < ε ≤ 1
Substitute (3) into (2), we have:
(− 1
2 FS,n ∈ Z+)
V [i] = A· sin(2πε i
FS
+ φ0)
(i ∈ {0,1,2,3, ...})
(3)
(4)
These equations describe the basic relationship be-
tween the out-of-band analog signal and the digitized sig-
nal: a sinusoidal analog signal with a frequency F will be
aliased to a digital signal with a frequency of ε.
Our discussions in this section mainly focus on signals
with frequencies close to the same integer multiple of
sample rate. Therefore, we assume that n in (3) stays the
same when ε, F or FS slightly changes.

the frequency of the induced output is not a constant.
Ampliﬁcation Effect of Sample Rate Drifts. ADC is
designed to sample the voltage of the analog signal at
speciﬁc intervals. Theoretically, each interval should be
exactly 1
. Therefore, given F, the value of ε should be

determined (Equation 3). However, due to drifts in FS,
when we inject acoustic signals at a ﬁxed frequency into
a smartphone’s gyroscope, we ﬁnd that the frequency of
the digital output is deviating, as shown in Figure 2. We
formalize the following theorem to explain why slight
sample rate drifts could result in observable deviations
in the frequency of the digital signal.
Theorem 1. When a signal with a frequency F is sam-
pled with an insufﬁcient sample rate FS (FS < 2F), a drift
