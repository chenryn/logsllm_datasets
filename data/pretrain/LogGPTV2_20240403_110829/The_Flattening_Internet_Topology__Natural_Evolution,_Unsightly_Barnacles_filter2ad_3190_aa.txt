## Abstract
In this paper, we collect and analyze traceroute measurements to show that large content providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!) are deploying their own wide-area networks (WANs), bringing their networks closer to users, and bypassing Tier-1 ISPs on many paths. This trend, if it continues and is adopted by more content providers, could flatten the Internet topology and may result in numerous other consequences for users, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), content providers, and network researchers.

## 1. Introduction
Since its creation in 1969, the Internet has undergone several significant changes. From its beginnings as a research network, the Internet evolved into a commercial network by the mid-1990s [5]. The emergence of "killer applications" such as the World-Wide Web and Peer-to-Peer file sharing vastly expanded the Internet user base [11]. For various reasons, including the commercialization and increased popularity of the Internet, it has become extremely difficult to make ubiquitous changes to the Internet infrastructure. This has led to the emergence of architectural barnacles [15], or ad hoc work-arounds for a variety of architectural problems. Architectural purists argue that barnacles may provide short-term relief but exacerbate underlying issues over the long term [15].

In this paper, we examine a new trend at the infrastructure level of the Internet: large content providers are assembling their own wide-area networks. If this becomes common practice, it could significantly change the structure of the Internet and have numerous ramifications for users, ISPs, content providers, and network researchers.

We find that companies like Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft are deploying large WANs. Google's WAN infrastructure covers much of the U.S. and extends to Europe, Asia, and South America. Yahoo! and Microsoft also have WANs covering the U.S. but do not yet extend to other regions. These efforts may force other Internet companies to follow suit to remain competitive. For example, MySpace appears to be partnering with Limelight Networks, a Content Delivery Network, to build a WAN for MySpace.

Our paper makes several contributions:
1. We alert the network research community to this emerging trend, which may affect the assumptions used in other studies.
2. We provide initial measurements on the number and size of the networks already in place for some large content providers.
3. We describe the potential implications of this trend and discuss whether it is a natural evolution of the Internet architecture, an unsightly barnacle creating additional problems, or a contrived attempt to disrupt the balance of power among the providers of the Internet architecture.

## 2. Background

### 2.1. Internet Architecture
The Internet architecture has evolved throughout its history. Initially, a single backbone network connected a small number of research networks, enabling researchers to remotely access computing resources at other institutions [5]. In the late 1980s, commercial ISPs began to form, and by 1995, the backbone network was completely transitioned to commercial operation [5]. This transformation resulted in the current three-tiered organization of the Internet infrastructure:
- **Backbone networks (Tier-1 ISPs):** A few major ISPs that transit traffic for their customers (Tier-2 ISPs) for a fee. Tier-1 ISPs peer with all other Tier-1 ISPs without paying transit fees, forming the Internet backbone [11].
- **Regional networks (Tier-2 ISPs):** Connect a number of Tier-3 providers to the Internet. They peer with other Tier-2 ISPs to deliver their customers' traffic and may also connect to some Tier-1 ISPs to reach a larger fraction of the Internet.
- **Access networks (Tier-3 ISPs):** Consumers and content providers access the Internet via Tier-3 ISPs.

### 2.2. Motivations for Change
There are several reasons why content providers may be motivated to build their own wide-area networks rather than utilizing ISPs to deliver content to users. These can be categorized into business reasons, technical challenges, and opportunities.

#### Business Reasons
- **Risk Mitigation:** After the "dot-com bubble" burst around 2000, many Internet companies, including Tier-1 ISPs such as WorldCom, Genuity, and Global Crossing, went bankrupt [13]. Surviving and new Internet companies focused on risk mitigation and cost control. One strategy is to reduce dependencies on partners to avoid disruptions if a partner declares bankruptcy.
- **Cost Control:** To control costs, content providers may seek to reduce or eliminate existing costs. One strategy is to use settlement-free peering arrangements with ISPs instead of traditional pay-for-use transit relationships [14]. For large content providers and small ISPs, peering can be mutually beneficial.

#### Technical Challenges
- **Application Deployment:** Content providers may wish to deploy new "killer" applications, such as video-on-demand. Although scalable video on-demand delivery techniques exist, none have been widely deployed due to the lack of IP multicast on the Internet. This limitation, known as the "Internet Impasse" [15], makes it nearly impossible to adopt ubiquitous architectural changes. A private WAN could avoid this impasse and give content providers more control over end-to-end application performance.

#### Opportunities
- **Infrastructure Investment:** Some companies, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, aim to provide "Software as a Service" (SaaS), delivering functionality via the Web that was previously available only through software installed on the user’s computer. In response, several companies are making multi-billion dollar investments in infrastructure such as large data centers [6,12] and WANs.
- **Acquisition of Infrastructure:** Due to the bursting of the "dot-com bubble," content providers may be able to inexpensively obtain WAN infrastructure (e.g., installed fiber optic network links) from bankrupt ISPs.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Data Collection
Our measurement of popular content provider networks utilizes the traceroute tool, which is commonly used to identify network topology.

To determine the extent of content provider networks, we followed this methodology:
1. Identify a set of N popular content providers.
2. For each content provider, select an endpoint (i.e., a server).
3. Select a set of M geographically-distributed nodes to issue traceroute queries.
4. Issue N×M traceroute queries.

For this study, we collected a single snapshot of the networks of the top 20 content providers, as ranked by Alexa [1], by querying from 50 different traceroute servers. The 20 top content providers are listed in Table 1.

| Rank | Website |
|------|---------|
| 1    | www.yahoo.com |
| 2    | www.qq.com |
| 3    | www.google.com |
| 4    | www.youtube.com |
| 5    | www.fotolog.net |
| 6    | www.msn.com |
| 7    | www.baidu.com |
| 8    | www.sina.com.cn |
| 9    | www.wikipedia.org |
| 10   | www.facebook.com |
| 11   | www.orkut.com |
| 12   | www.rapidshare.com |
| 13   | www.megaupload.com |
| 14   | www.blogger.com |
| 15   | www.live.com |
| 16   | www.friendster.com |
| 17   | www.yahoo.co.jp |
| 18   | www.microsoft.com |
| 19   | www.hi5.com |
| 20   | www.myspace.com |

We resolved the hostnames of the popular sites only once and at a single location (the University of Calgary). This approach prevents our queries from being redirected to local instances of servers. Since our goal is to understand the size of content provider networks, not to measure end-user performance, this approach is reasonable.

We selected 50 nodes to issue queries from, biased towards the country where the content provider is based and areas with higher concentrations of Internet users. At the time of our study (September 2007), 15 out of 20 of the top global sites listed by Alexa were U.S.-based. Therefore, we selected 20 traceroute servers in the U.S., located in 20 different states, including the 10 most populous states. The remaining 30 traceroute servers were selected from countries around the world, accounting for an estimated 82.7% of all Internet users.

To keep the load on the 20 selected servers low, we issued only a single traceroute query from each server to each destination, one query at a time, and throttled the rate at which the queries were issued. Our data collection occurred between September 27 and October 1, 2007. In future work, we plan to collect data periodically to understand the rate of expansion of content provider networks.

### 3.2. Data Analysis
Analyzing the traceroute data presented several challenges:
1. **Parsing Automation:** Among the 50 different traceroute servers, there were 10 different output formats, requiring a parser to handle all of them.
2. **Data Completeness:** The traceroute output only contained a portion of the data of interest, necessitating additional sources of data (e.g., IP address to organization mappings, organization to Autonomous System (AS) number mappings).
3. **Metric Development:** There were no obvious metrics for quantifying the size of the WAN of each content provider, requiring manual inspection of the data to determine what the analysis should evaluate.

We overcame these challenges by developing a program to parse the outputs of the various traceroute servers, extracting the sequence of IP addresses for each query. We then gathered additional data about each IP, including the identity of the organization that registered the IP address and the AS number for the IP address.

We selected four metrics to facilitate the comparison of content provider networks and to examine whether the Internet topology is flattening:
1. **Average Number of Hops on Tier-1 Networks:** Measures how involved Tier-1 ISPs are in the path.
2. **Number of Paths Involving No Tier-1 ISPs:** Indicates the extent to which content providers are bypassing Tier-1 ISPs.
3. **Degree:** Provides a conservative estimate of the number of different ISPs a content provider is connected to.
4. **Number of Geographic Locations:** Examines the number of geographic locations where a content provider's routers appear to be located.

We acknowledge that these metrics have limitations, but they provide interesting insights. For example, in the traditional Internet model, popular content providers might peer exclusively with a number of Tier-1 ISPs to ensure global coverage with a minimal number of exchanges on each end-to-end path. If the Internet is flattening, we might expect to see more extensive peering with lower-tier ISPs.

## 4. Results
In our analysis, we observe that some companies own multiple top 20 sites. Specifically, Orkut and Blogger are both owned by Google, and traffic for these sites is carried on Google's network. Similarly, MSN and Live, owned by Microsoft, have their traffic carried on the same network. As a result, we only consider one site for each company when the traffic is carried on the same network. Therefore, for our results, we omit Orkut, Blogger, MSN, and Live, and only show the results for Google and Microsoft.
