### Proposal: Add "Open New Window" Shortcut in Windows Terminal

I propose adding a new action with a shortcut, `Open New Window`, which will launch a new instance of Windows Terminal (essentially a new WT process). This feature is standard in almost all other terminal applications across various operating systems and desktop environments, and I find it indispensable for my workflow.

#### Use Cases:
- **Parallel Viewing:** Often, I need to open multiple terminal windows side-by-side to monitor logs using `tail -f`, manage and orchestrate multiple machines, and observe their interactions.
- **Efficiency and Convenience:** Having a quick and easy way to open a new terminal window enhances productivity and streamlines my tasks.

#### Current Workflow:
Currently, to open a new window in Windows Terminal, I have to either:
1. **Use the Mouse:** Move my hand from the keyboard to the mouse, locate the Windows Terminal icon in the taskbar, and middle-click it.
2. **Navigate Menus:** Open the Windows Start menu, navigate through a series of submenus, and finally select the option to open a new terminal window.

Both methods are time-consuming and disrupt my workflow, making me feel less efficient compared to using other terminal applications that offer a simple keyboard shortcut.

#### Proposed Solution:
To address this, I propose implementing the `Open New Window` action and assigning it a shortcut, preferably `Ctrl+Shift+N`. This will allow users to quickly open a new terminal window with minimal disruption, enhancing the overall user experience and productivity.

Thank you for considering this proposal.
