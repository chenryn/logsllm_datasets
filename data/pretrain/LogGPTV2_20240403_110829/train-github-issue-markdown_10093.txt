I propose to add a new action with a shortcut: `Open New Window`, which will
open a new WT window (a new WT process essentially).
I use this often as it is a standard feature of almost all other terminals in
other OSes and DEs that I used. I often need to open a new terminal side-by-
side with other open terminal windows, in order to view them in parallel
(monitor logs with tail -f, work and orchestrate concurrently multiple
machines and how they communicate together etc. and I'm sure that are
countless other reasons for needing this).
Now, the way to open a new window in WT is either to raise my hand from the
keyboard to grab (OMG, I know it's not important but I hate doing this) the
mouse and hunt-and-peck the terminal icon in the taskbar to middle click it,
or open the windows start menu and navigate through a charade of submenus in
order to do it.
This is frustrating for me, wastes my time and makes me feel that "my hands
are tight" while using WT, compared to any other terminal in any other OS that
I use which is just a shortcut away taking a only the time of a blink of an
eye.
Therefore I propose to implement this action and assign a shortcut to it
(preferably `Ctrl+Shift+n`).
