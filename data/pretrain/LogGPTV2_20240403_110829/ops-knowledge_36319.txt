User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I only require LDAP login once? I'm protecting a few different directories with LDAP. My problem is that you have to log into each directory separately even though it's the same user for almost all of them. Here's the pertinent part of my httpd.conf:

LoadModule vhost_alias_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_vhost_alias.so

&lt;Directory /var/www/wiki&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Files"
  AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwords
  Require user galapagos
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory /var/www/staging&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Files"
  AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwords
  Require user galapagos
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory /var/www/mantis&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Files"
  AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwords
  Require user galapagos
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory /home/jason/projects&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted Files"
  AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwords
  Require user jason
&lt;/Directory&gt;


How do I factor out all the parts that are the same and only require galapagos' login once?

Assistant: Since there were no great answers here, my answer was to buy the book LDAP System Administration.
