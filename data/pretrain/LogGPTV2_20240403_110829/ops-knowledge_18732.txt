Assistant: This log chunk shows the completion of tasks in stage 17 and the beginning of tasks in stage 18. The python.PythonRunner reported a total time of 42, boot time of -71, init time of 112, and finish time of 1. The executor.Executor reported the completion of 5 tasks (0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0) in stage 17, and the executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend assigned 5 tasks (722, 736, 750, 758, and 759) in stage 18. The broadcast.TorrentBroadcast started reading broadcast variable 27, and the storage.MemoryStore stored blocks broadcast_27_piece0 and broadcast_27 in memory. The reading of broadcast variable 27 took 10 ms.
