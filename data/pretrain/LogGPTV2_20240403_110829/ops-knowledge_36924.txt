User: I'm trying to generate an encryption key for a file and then save it for use next time the script runs. I know that's not very secure, but it's just an interim solution for keeping a password out of a git repo.
subprocess.call('export KEY="password"', shell=True) returns 0 and does nothing.
Running export KEY="password" manually in my bash prompt works fine on Ubuntu.
Assistant: This isn't a thing you can do. Your subprocess call creates a subshell and sets the env var there, but doesn't affect the current process, let alone the calling shell.
