the slope, at the top 4% of heavy-hitters using more than
2.5GB/day (or 230kbits/sec) for the total users, and at the
top 10% using more than 2.5GB/day for the ﬁber users. It is
less clear for the DSL users, but a knee can be seen at around
the top 2% using more than 2.5GB/day. The distribution
also shows that outbound traﬃc is larger for the majority
of the users on the left side of the knee but it does not hold
for heavy-hitters on the right side of the knee.
The distribution has a diﬀerent slope for those who upload
more than 2.5GB/day so we use this ﬁgure to statistically
distinguish heavy-hitters from the rest of the users. We clas-
sify users who upload more than an average of 2.5GB/day
to be in the heavy-hitter group, and those who upload less
than 2.5GB/day to be in the normal user group. The nor-
mal user group should be interpreted as users other than
the most inﬂuential heavy-hitters. Note that the diﬀerence
is only in the slope of the distribution, and the boundary
between the two groups is not clear. In other words, users
are distributed statistically over a wide traﬃc volume range,
even up to the most extreme heavy-hitters. A concave curve

Figure 13: Cumulative distribution of daily traﬃc
per user: a metropolitan prefecture (top) and a ru-
ral prefecture (bottom)
is not found in the plots denoting that there is no signiﬁcant
gap in traﬃc usage among users.
As for prefectural diﬀerences, the distributions look simi-
lar across diﬀerent prefectures as shown in Figure 13 which
compares one metropolitan prefecture (top) with one rural
prefecture (bottom). One diﬀerence is the tail length due to
the diﬀerence in the number of users. Another diﬀerence is
that the distribution of the metropolitan prefecture is closer
to that of the total users, and the distribution of the rural
prefecture is closer to that of the DSL users. The results in-
dicate that the distribution of heavy-hitters is similar across
diﬀerent regions with slight diﬀerences in the ratio of heavy-
hitter population due to the ratio of ﬁber users with a larger
heavy-hitter population.
4.2 Correlation of Inbound and Outbound
Volumes
The correlation between inbound and outbound volumes
for each user is shown as log-log scatter plots in Figure 14.
These are taken from a metropolitan prefecture and plot
about 4300 points for ﬁber and about 5400 for DSL but the
characteristics are common to all the prefectures.
There is a positive correlation as expected, and the highest
density cluster is below and parallel to the unity line where
outbound volume (downstreaming for users) is about ten
times larger than that of inbound. In a higher volume region,
a diﬀerent cluster appears to exist around the unity line.
The slope of the cluster seems to be slightly larger than 1,
which explains the inversion of inbound and outbound traf-
ﬁc volumes in Figure 12. It can be also observed that, across
the entire traﬃc volume range, the inbound/outbound traf-
ﬁc ratio varies greatly, up to 4 orders of magnitude.
Both ﬁber and DSL plots show similar distributions but,
as expected, the high-volume cluster is larger in the ﬁber

Figure 14: Correlation of inbound and outbound
traﬃc volumes per user in one metropolitan pre-
fecture: ﬁber (top) and DSL (bottom)
plot, especially above the unity line. A plausible interpre-
tation of excess upstream traﬃc of the ﬁber heavy-hitters is
that available bandwidth in ﬁber access is used to compen-
sate for the shortage of upstream bandwidth of DSL heavy-
hitters. It is also noticeable that there are much more low-
volume users in the DSL plot. However, the boundary of the
two clusters is not very clear. There seems to be no clear
qualitative diﬀerence in the behaviors of ﬁber and DSL users
except the percentage of heavy-hitters.
4.3 Temporal Behavior
Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare the temporal behaviors
of the ﬁber users and the DSL users. The volume is normal-
ized to the peak value of the total traﬃc size so as to not
reveal the absolute traﬃc volume of the ISP. The graphs are
shown in the same scale to compare ﬁber and DSL volumes.
The plots show that the inbound and outbound volumes
are almost equal for ﬁber traﬃc but the inbound is 61%
larger for heavy-hitters and the outbound is 166% larger for
the normal users. The total is counterbalanced by the two
groups.
In the DSL traﬃc, the outbound volume is 83%
larger for the total users, only 11% larger for the heavy-
hitters and 179% larger for the normal users. The total
reﬂects the oﬀset of the normal users.
The inbound traﬃc of the ﬁber heavy-hitters is much
larger than the outbound traﬃc, and has large daily ﬂuc-
tuations. On the other hand, the inbound traﬃc of DSL
heavy-hitters is saturated. As a result, the ﬁber traﬃc ac-
counts for 86% of the total inbound volume and 80% of the
total residential volume, and the behavior of the total traﬃc
is heavily inﬂuenced by the ﬁber heavy-hitters.
Figure 17 compares the temporal change in the number of
active users in ﬁber and DSL. Again, the active user numbers
Figure 15: Fiber weekly traﬃc: total ﬁber users
(top), heavy-hitters (middle) and normal users (bot-
tom)
are normalized to the peak value of the total active users.
The number of active users is fairly constant for the heavy-
hitters, especially for DSL. The constant portion seems to
be users running automated data-transfer software. The in-
crease of active users in the morning is larger than that of
traﬃc volume but the increase in the evening is smaller,
which suggests that bandwidth use is more intense,
i.e.,
higher bandwidth demand per user, in the evening.
