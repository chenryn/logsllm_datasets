### 4.1 Distribution of Daily Traffic per User

The slope of the distribution indicates that the top 4% of heavy-hitters, who use more than 2.5GB/day (or 230 kbits/sec), are among the total users. For fiber users, the top 10% also use more than 2.5GB/day. For DSL users, a knee in the distribution is observed at around the top 2%, where users exceed 2.5GB/day. The distribution shows that outbound traffic is generally higher for the majority of users on the left side of the knee, but this trend does not hold for heavy-hitters on the right side.

To statistically distinguish heavy-hitters from other users, we use the 2.5GB/day threshold. Users who upload more than an average of 2.5GB/day are classified as heavy-hitters, while those who upload less are considered normal users. The normal user group includes all users except the most influential heavy-hitters. It's important to note that the difference between the two groups is primarily in the slope of the distribution, and there is no clear boundary. Users are distributed over a wide range of traffic volumes, even up to the most extreme heavy-hitters. The absence of a concave curve in the plots indicates that there is no significant gap in traffic usage among users.

### Prefectural Differences

Figure 13 compares the cumulative distribution of daily traffic per user in a metropolitan prefecture (top) and a rural prefecture (bottom). The distributions across different prefectures are similar, with some differences in tail length due to the number of users. The distribution for the metropolitan prefecture is closer to that of the total users, while the rural prefecture's distribution is closer to that of DSL users. This suggests that the distribution of heavy-hitters is consistent across different regions, with slight variations in the ratio of heavy-hitters, influenced by the proportion of fiber users.

### 4.2 Correlation of Inbound and Outbound Volumes

Figure 14 shows the log-log scatter plots of the correlation between inbound and outbound volumes for each user, taken from a metropolitan prefecture. The plots include approximately 4,300 points for fiber and about 5,400 for DSL, but the characteristics are common across all prefectures.

There is a positive correlation, with the highest density cluster below and parallel to the unity line, where outbound volume (downstream for users) is about ten times larger than inbound. In the high-volume region, a different cluster appears around the unity line, with a slope slightly greater than 1, indicating the inversion of inbound and outbound traffic volumes. Across the entire traffic volume range, the inbound/outbound traffic ratio varies significantly, up to four orders of magnitude.

Both fiber and DSL plots show similar distributions, but the high-volume cluster is larger in the fiber plot, especially above the unity line. This suggests that available bandwidth in fiber access is used to compensate for the shortage of upstream bandwidth in DSL. There are more low-volume users in the DSL plot, but the boundary between the two clusters is not very clear. The only significant difference in behavior between fiber and DSL users is the percentage of heavy-hitters.

### 4.3 Temporal Behavior

Figures 15 and 16 compare the temporal behaviors of fiber and DSL users. The traffic volume is normalized to the peak value of the total traffic size to maintain confidentiality. The graphs are scaled similarly to facilitate comparison.

For fiber traffic, inbound and outbound volumes are nearly equal, but for heavy-hitters, inbound traffic is 61% larger, and for normal users, outbound traffic is 166% larger. The total traffic is balanced by these two groups. In DSL traffic, the outbound volume is 83% larger for total users, 11% larger for heavy-hitters, and 179% larger for normal users. The total reflects the offset of the normal users.

Fiber heavy-hitters have much larger inbound traffic with large daily fluctuations, while DSL heavy-hitters have saturated inbound traffic. As a result, fiber traffic accounts for 86% of the total inbound volume and 80% of the total residential volume, heavily influencing the overall traffic behavior.

Figure 17 shows the temporal change in the number of active users for fiber and DSL, normalized to the peak value of total active users. The number of active users is fairly constant for heavy-hitters, particularly in DSL, suggesting the presence of automated data-transfer software. The increase in active users in the morning is larger than the increase in traffic volume, while the evening increase is smaller, indicating higher bandwidth demand per user in the evening.

### 4.4 Protocol and Port Usage

Table 6 breaks down the protocol usage, showing that TCP dynamic ports account for 83% of the total traffic. The breakdown is as follows:

- **TCP**: 83.44%
  - *Dynamic Ports (1024-65535)*: 6699 winmx, 6346 gnutella, 7743 winny, 6881 bittorrent, 6348 gnutella
- **UDP**: 13.99%
  - *Ports*: 25 smtp, 119 nntp, 21 ftp, 22 ssh, others
- **ESP**: 0.93%
- **GRE**: 0.38%
- **ICMP**: 0.30%
- **Others**: 0.17%

Other notable ports include:
- 1935 macromedia-fsc: 1.40%
- 1755 ms-streaming: 0.92%
- 2265: 0.48%
- 1234: 0.25%
- 4662 edonkey: 0.21%
- 6257 winmx: 1.38%

This detailed breakdown provides insight into the protocols and ports used in the network, highlighting the dominance of TCP dynamic ports.
