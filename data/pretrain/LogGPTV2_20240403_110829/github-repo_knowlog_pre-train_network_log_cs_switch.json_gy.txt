This is usually caused by a misconfiguration of the tunnel or a temporary instability due to route flapping elsewhere in your network. It is important to take steps to ensure that routing information between the carrier networks and the payload networks is not allowed to mix. If the router discovers a recursive routing problem it will temporarily shut down the tunnel interface for a few minutes so that the situation that is causing this problem can resolve itself as routing protocols converge. If the problem is caused by misconfiguration the link may oscillate indefinitely."
