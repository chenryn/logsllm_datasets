The websocket functionality from std/ws is awesome. However, when writing code
that targets deno and browser, it doesn't fare as well. Wondering if RT should
provide a browser compatible version that can be wrapped by std/ws or vice
versa.
This would allow us to have it both ways, and I for one am sold on it.
