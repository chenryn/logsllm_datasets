proposed extension. Their suggestion is for recursive servers
to truncate the client’s IP address into a source network mask,
which typically contains the ﬁrst 24 bits, in an effort to pre-
serve privacy. The authors also suggest that entities responsible
for operating ECS-enabled recursives should adjust the source
netmask such that it reveals the least information possible
about the client, while still providing beneﬁcial information
to ECS-enabled authorities, so that they can serve the client
the proper IP. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study
that demonstrates what portion, if any, of an IP address can
be safely revealed while still preserving user privacy. Thus, it
is unclear if the RFC’s suggestion of using a source netmask
is sufﬁcient.
Before evaluating the privacy suggestions in the RFC, we
ﬁrst compared the assumed “/24 default” in the protocol to
the general allocation and delegation practices found in IPv4.
The RFC suggests that the /24 of the client’s IP is sufﬁcient
to protect users’ privacy while allowing better geolocation
identiﬁcation. However, that brings up the question of whether
another choice, for example /16 or some other mask size,
would perform as well while leaking less information.
To that end, we show the distribution of the announced
preﬁxes on the Internet for two snapshots, one in April 2015
and one in June 2019. The dataset includes also the organi-
zation for each announced preﬁx. These ﬁgures showcase the
changes that the Internet has undergone over these few years.
For the 2015 dataset, we downloaded the public delega-
tion ﬁles from each of the ﬁve Regional Internet Registries
(RIR) [25]. Since delegations are updated daily, we picked
a single snapshot spanning April 6, 2015, to April 7, 2015,
to limit experimental complexity and account for time zone
variations across registries. The delegation ﬁles only map
preﬁxes to autonomous systems. Therefore we use the Team
Cymru IP to ASN tool [1] to associate the preﬁxes and their
associated organizations. On April 9, 2015, there were 325,680
preﬁxes found for the entire IPv4 address space. While the vast
majority of these were /24s, the shortest preﬁx found was a /8
and the longest was a /32. Figure 8 shows the distribution of
these preﬁxes across the different subnet masks. Note that the
vast majority (50%) of the preﬁxes are allocated as /24, and
only 12,496 (4%) are less than or equal to a /16.
We examine the same statistics for June 2019, this time
through the Route Views [45] dataset (that already has the
ASN to organization mappings), in order to measure how this

aspect of the internet has evolved. As indicated by Figure 9,
the total number of preﬁxes currently is 732,182, more than
double compared to four years ago. This is expected since
the internet landscape has been constantly evolving over time
with more and more companies opting to use it. However, the
distribution of the preﬁxes has remained more or less the same,
especially for the lower preﬁxes (up to /24). Approximately
396,045 (54%) of the announced preﬁxes, are /24 and 17,588
(2.5%) are less or equal to /16. The utilization of preﬁxes larger
than /24 has also increased considerably, but that is not of
immediate interest to our study since the RFC has determined
that at most a /24 can be leaked without compromising client’s
privacy. Overall, by comparing the two ﬁgures side by side,
it is evident that there is a trend of smaller portions of the
IP space being delegated to the organizations, resulting in a
higher percentage of longer network preﬁxes.
Considering that ECS reveals the IP address of the stub
resolver and depending on an organization’s network infras-
tructure, ECS might reveal information about the stub’s be-
havior to third parties that might not be necessary for the
optimal routing of information back to the client. This applies

particularly to cases where the client inside a network uses
a DNS provider outside the organization network with ECS
enabled as the default. In such cases, ECS should ideally
use only the preﬁx length that would provide with enough
geographical information for optimal content delivery. With
this in mind, we attempt to measure the extent to which this if
feasible as we vary the length of the subnet mask. We expect
that, by reducing the preﬁx length, the behavior of clients
within an organization will no longer be able to be uniquely
identiﬁed. This is also a way to theoretically test the ability to
set custom ECS network masks as per the RFC. Organizations
that want to avoid this type of information leak should augment
their IT policies to make sure that any client operating on their
network is not using cloud based DNS providers that might
expose their organization’s IP to outside parties. Considering
the prevalence in the use of cloud based DNS resolvers and
their use in devices like mobile phones, we believe that this
part of the study can help shed some light into the potential
issues that can arise in such a scenario.
We set up the measurement as follows: Using the Route
Views dataset [45] of preﬁxes and corresponding organizations,
we organized the preﬁxes as a radix tree, so that it is easy to
collect the organizations that are covered by a given preﬁx.
Then, we calculated the probability of a network preﬁx falling
into a single organization for a given source network mask. We
chose to use network preﬁxes instead of IP addresses, because
they align more closely with organizational delegations from
RIRs. We limit our computations to preﬁxes between “/8” and
“/24”, because ECS suggests that a “/24” preﬁx is sufﬁcient.
For each possible network preﬁx in the Route Views dataset,
we sequentially reduced the length of the source network mask
being revealed and measured the number of unique candidate
organizations after each reduction. The probability computed
for a given network preﬁx and source network mask equals the
percentage of preﬁxes for which only a single organization was
a possible match, i.e., the probability of uniquely identifying
an organization for a given preﬁx and source network mask.
For example, assume a stub resolver connects from a given
preﬁx X.Y.Z.W/24 (with subnet mask length 24). We reduce
the length of the network mask to 22, and we get all the

lengths 22,23 and 24 (there is no point examining lengths more
than 24 since we assumed that the origin subnet is a /24). If
only one organization appears, then the target organization can
be uniquely identiﬁed, even after reducing the mask length by
2 bits.
Figure 10 shows that changing the source network mask
does not always increase the number of the candidate or-
ganizations a request may originate from. For example, a
user connecting to the Internet through a /24 and revealing
a /16 source network mask can be linked to a single orga-
nization about 20% of the time. The likelihood of uniquely
identifying the organization jumps to 50% if a user connects
from a /16 and reveals a /14 mask. Consequently, it is often
quite easy to precisely identify the originating organization,
despite changes in the source network mask introduced by
ECS. Most organizations, though, have publicly documented
network boundaries, so this is only a consideration for not
documented organizations.
With these observations in mind, we can observe that
the default subnet considerations made by the ECS RFC are
proving to have wider implications in terms of identifying
behavior from within networks, especially because so much
of the internet infrastructure is based around network masks
of /24. This is also the observation that the authors of the RFC
had made early during draft making progress [13] that there
should be a selectable mask length ﬂag due to the potential
privacy concerns of the initial proposal.
B. ECS Adoption Over the Years
In 2013, a group of researchers from the Technical Uni-
versity of Berlin measured ECS adoption among the Alexa
top million websites [43]. In their ﬁndings, it is stated that
approximately 13% of the Alexa top million domains were
found to provide some support for ECS. With the goal of
measuring how the adoption has evolved over time, we set
up a custom resolver that complies with RFC 7871 and
implements ECS. Then we performed similar experiments by
sending ECS enabled requests to authorities and analyzing
their responses. The pipeline is simple. First, we collect all
the Alexa top million domains. Second, we query for the
nameservers that are authoritative for these domains. As a ﬁnal
step, we pull the domain’s A record from the corresponding
authority using our ECS-enabled resolver with a random client
subnet. The detailed results for two randomly selected days,
one in April 2015 and one in June 2019, are presented next.
These snapshots will reveal useful information regarding the
ECS adoption.
In August 2015, there were 5,607 ECS-enabled authori-
ties, which account for approximately 3% of all authorities
(187,730), that serve domains in the Alexa top million. Due to
network errors and misconﬁgured authorities, we were able
to successfully measure 731,813 (73%) of these domains,
out of which 161,302 were ECS-enabled and served by the
previously identiﬁed ECS-enabled authorities. Almost 22% of
the domains are ECS-enabled; this represents a 9% increase
in ECS-enabled domains since 2013.
In the June 2019 case, approximately 92% of the total
domains were successfully measured, and the number of ECS-
Fig. 11: The percentage of ECS-enabled domains from the domains
that responded, aggregated into buckets of 10,000 elements, for the
Alexa top million web sites for 2019 and 2015. As expected, the most
popular domain names are also ECS-enabled. In total, we identiﬁed
161,302 ECS-enabled domains in April 2015 and 418,314 in June
2019.
Fig. 12: CDF of the authority rank for ECS and non-ECS enabled
authorities. The authority rank is the average Alexa rank of the
domains that this authority is authoritative for. The ECS-enabled
domains are served by 19,133 authorities in June 2019, compared
to 5,607 authorities in April 2015.
enabled authorities are 19,133 (out of 173,905 authorities), a
huge increase compared to 2015 data. This accounts for 11%
of the unique authorities that serve the top domains in the
Alexa dataset. However, the ECS adoption over the years has
been strong, and 418,314 out of the measured 922,139 (45%)
domains support ECS. This is a signiﬁcant increase compared
to 2015 as well.
Given that ECS aims to improve network performance,
intuition suggests that popular sites are more likely to beneﬁt
from its use, and therefore, they should be more likely to use
ECS-enabled domains. To test this hypothesis, we aggregated
the ECS-enabled domains in the Alexa top million by their
Alexa rank. Figures 11 and 12 present the distribution of
ECS-enabled domains and authorities, respectively, according
to their rank for our measurements in 2019 and 2015. The
authority rank is deﬁned as the average Alexa rank of all
domains for which the given DNS server is authoritative.

the trend that a larger percentage of the highly ranked domains
tend to support ECS compared to the lower ranks, with some
notable exceptions. Especially for 2015, this is very clear, even
though the ECS adoption between ranks do not vary as greatly
as 2019. The top ranks of the Alexa dataset traditionally do
not change drastically over time, compared to the lower ranks.
Additionally, these domains are associated with sites that are
visited by millions of clients daily. Consequently, these sites
often have multiple servers located all around the globe and
may use CDNs to help improve network performance. Such
sites represent the intended beneﬁciaries of ECS. Compared
to 2015, it is apparent that many more domains support ECS
today, even in the lower ranks. Websites are increasingly
relying on CDNs to enhance their customer . This, combined
with the introduction of new domains in the dataset that were
not there in the past and serve different content, justiﬁes the
difference over the years.
The majority of authorities (Figure 12) in the 2019 dataset
have ranks falling around the middle of the top million, while
in the 2015 dataset the landscape is more balanced with ECS-
enabled authorities having almost a linear distribution over the
possible ranks. This is reasonable since the authority ranks are
averages, suggesting that many authorities today are shared by
domains spanning multiple ranks in the Alexa top million. The
prevalence of shared hosting and DNS services likely explains
much of this behavior.
This result highlights that there is a clear trend in ECS
adoption over the years. Even though ECS is an optional stan-
dard designed to solve a particular issue, we have observed
a steady increase in the adoption of this extension over time
by a variety of websites without an apparent consideration as
to whether the adoption of ECS would offer a performance
improvement to the website.
C. Client IP Subnet Information
Using DNS logs generated from the authorities we dis-
cussed above, we were able to observe the geographic and
network locality of clients. Since ECS was enabled on the
authorities, recursives submitted ECS-enabled domain reso-
lution requests, leaking the ﬁrst three octets of the clients’
IP addresses. Using this leaked client preﬁx, we were able
to identify in greater detail the potential geographic location
of the DNS requests than solely relying on the recursive
IP. Furthermore, we could identify speciﬁc organizations and
networks, many of them research institutes and government
networks that were interested in the domain names in our
sinkhole authority. This information was collected by solely
operating an authority and would have not been available to
us if it was not for ECS.
1) Client Geolocation and Network preﬁxes: In the absence
of ECS,
the visibility of the authorities would have been
limited to the recursive IPs. However, when ECS is taken
into consideration, we are able to observe a signiﬁcantly
better picture of the geolocation of the clients “behind” the
recursives. Figure 13 shows the geographic distribution of the
ECS enabled recursives and the clients that resolved domain
names in each of the authorities. More speciﬁcally, we were
able to identify 180, 231, and 204 more countries in the

enabled requests and the recursives of legacy DNS requests for a
random day in each dataset. We can see that in the TLD and the
DNS Zones the ECS enabled trafﬁc comes from more “/24s” than
the trafﬁc of the legacy DNS requests, even though the legacy DNS
requests constitute the majority of the daily DNS requests.
