# Title: Cellular vs. WiFi: Performance of Metro Area Mobile Connections
# Authors: Joel Sommers and Paul Barford

## Abstract
Cellular and 802.11 WiFi are both popular options for mobile internet connectivity. Our study aims to understand the performance characteristics of these technologies in various environments and usage conditions. We compare and contrast cellular and WiFi performance using crowd-sourced data from Speedtest.net, analyzing over 3 million user-initiated tests from iOS and Android apps in 15 different metropolitan areas over a 15-week period. Our findings indicate that:

- WiFi generally provides better absolute download and upload throughput, with more consistent performance.
- WiFi networks typically have lower latency, but cellular access often offers more consistent latency.
- Throughput and latency vary significantly based on the type of access (e.g., HSPA, EVDO, LTE, WiFi) and service provider.
- Consistency in performance for both cellular and WiFi is lower compared to wired broadband.
- Temporal analysis shows that performance varies with the time of day, with non-peak hours generally offering the best performance.
- Spatial analysis reveals that performance is highly variable across metro areas, but some subregions consistently offer better performance for either cellular or WiFi.
- Larger metro areas tend to provide higher throughput and lower latency, indicating where ISPs have focused their deployment efforts.
- The rollout of new cellular technologies and differences among local providers result in diverse performance characteristics.

## 1. Introduction
Over the past five years, there has been a significant increase in the availability and use of mobile devices that support both cellular and 802.11 WiFi. The combination of short-range, high-speed WiFi and long-range, lower-speed cellular capabilities is compelling and enables a wide range of new mobile applications. Driven by the popularity of hybrid smartphones like the iPhone and Android-based devices, there is a growing demand for bandwidth by mobile users.

A key challenge for WiFi-enabled cell phone users, service providers, and application designers is to identify and support the connectivity option that provides the best and most reliable performance. Short-term factors affecting performance include local service availability, site load, device characteristics, and interference. Long-term factors include the introduction of new technologies and the deployment of new infrastructure by service providers.

To help users understand their connectivity options, several commercial and open-source throughput testing applications are available. These applications measure the maximum bandwidth for uploads and downloads by sending streams of random bytes via HTTP between the device and a test server. While the specific mechanisms for selecting sending rates, measurements, and reporting vary, the data gathered can provide unique insights into mobile device performance.

In this paper, we investigate mobile device performance using crowd-sourced data from Speedtest.net, one of the most popular and widely deployed mobile bandwidth testers. This rich dataset includes information about the device operating system (iOS or Android), unique handset identifiers, GPS coordinates, test times, and achieved upload and download speeds. Speedtest servers are deployed in over 600 locations worldwide and are used by tens of thousands of users daily.

Our study focuses on understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of WiFi-enabled cell phones in selected metro areas with varying population densities and geographic features. We seek to answer questions such as:
- What is the relative performance of cellular vs. WiFi in a given area?
- How does performance vary across local access providers and sub-regions within the metro area?
- How does cellular and WiFi performance vary temporally in the metro area and its sub-regions?
- How consistent is performance for individual users over time?
- What specific features in the data differentiate observed performance?

Our long-term goal is to draw conclusions about the spatio-temporal aspects of WiFi-enabled cell phone performance, leading to improvements in relevant protocols, configurations, and infrastructure.

## 2. Data
This section describes the unique dataset that forms the basis of our study. We discuss the Speedtest deployment and performance measurement system, the Speedtest data, and the metro areas where the data were collected. We also consider how the collection methods and areas can influence the conclusions drawn from the data.

### 2.1 Speedtest Overview
Speedtest.net, managed by Ookla, Inc., is a platform for evaluating bandwidth and performance. It can be accessed via a flash-based website or through native apps for iOS and Android devices. Since its inception in 2006, over 3 billion performance tests have been conducted, with a significant increase in usage over the past year. Daily tests exceed 125,000 globally.

Each Speedtest is initiated by the client (browser or mobile app). The test request is directed to the nearest Speedtest server, with servers deployed in over 600 locations worldwide. Latency, download, and upload tests are conducted via HTTP (TCP port 80). Latency is measured by averaging 10 RTT ping-style tests. Download and upload tests, referred to as "throughput tests," involve transferring small files between the client and server to estimate bandwidth. The initial file transfer helps select a second file for the final test, with the size varying based on the initial estimate. Up to 8 parallel HTTP threads are used, and throughput estimates are provided up to 30 times per second. The top 10% and bottom 30% of samples are discarded, and the remaining samples are averaged to derive the throughput. Upload tests follow a similar process. Previous work by Bauer et al. [12] found that the Speedtest method accurately characterizes last-mile performance.

In this study, we analyze data from tests initiated by iOS and Android apps. Each full test generates a detailed log entry, including information about the device, location, and test results. Table 1 summarizes census and Speedtest data from the 15 target metro areas evaluated in our study.
