NOTE: When two systems are close to each other, their one-way delay values are very high
compared to their two-way delay values. This is because one-way delay measurement requires
the timing for the two systems to be synchronized at a very granular level and MX Series routers
do not support this granular synchronization. However, two-way delay measurement does not
require synchronized timing, making two-way delay measurements more accurate.

Example: Configuring Two-Way Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements with Single-
Tagged Interfaces
This example uses two MX Series routers: MX-1 and MX-2. The configuration creates a CFM down MEP
session on a VLAN-tagged logical interface connecting the two (ge-5/2/9 on Router MX-1 and ge-0/2/5
on Router MX-2).
NOTE: These are not complete router configurations.
