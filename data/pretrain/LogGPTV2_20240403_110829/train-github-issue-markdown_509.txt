Symfony choice fields with `expanded` set to `true` don’t render the selected
option correctly when the value in the underlying entity is `false`.
This affects Symfony 2.7.
## Steps to reproduce
Create the following entity:
    class Foo
    {
        public $bar = false;
    }
Create the following form:
    $form = $this->createFormBuilder(new Foo())
        ->add('bar', 'choice', array(
            'choices' => array(
                1 => 'Yes', // boolean `true` and `false` as keys also exhibit the same problem
                0 => 'No',
            ),
            'expanded' => true,
        ))
        ->getForm()
    ;
    return $this->render('AppBundle::form.html.twig', array(
        'form' => $form->createView(),
    ));
Create the following template:
    {{ form_start(form) }}
        {{ form_widget(form.bar) }}
    {{ form_end(form) }}
Expected result: the “no” radio button to be checked.  
Actual result: none of the checkboxes are checked.
Changing the value of `Foo::$bar` to `true` makes the “yes” radio button
correctly render in its selected state.
When the `expanded` option on the choice field is changed to `false`, an HTML
`select` menu is correctly rendered with the “no” option selected.
The exact same effect can be observed when the keys in the `choices` array are
boolean `true` and `false` instead of `1` and `0`.
