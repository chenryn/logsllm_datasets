In this section, we describe our IRS-based countermeasure
and provide further details about the IRS prototype used for
our experiments. We then elaborate on the IRS-based channel
obfuscation algorithm.
A. IRS-based Channel Obfuscation
As outlined in Section II-B, an IRS makes a portion of
the wireless channel between a transmitter and a receiver
adjustable. This technological novelty is our key building
block to ﬁnd an appropriate countermeasure against adversarial
wireless physical-layer sensing: We introduce a randomly,

deﬁned path (see the numbering in Fig. 3). We plot the channel sliding-window
standard deviation observed by the adversary with and without movement in
the target area.
time-varying IRS into the target area and thereby add ran-
domness to the eavesdropper’s channel observation to hamper
detection of human motion.
Crucially, the IRS is a powerful yet simple tool that the
defender can use to invalidate the assumption underlying the
attack: While variations of the channel previously allowed
to conclude on environmental variations and human motion,
the IRS now introduces artiﬁcial variations, effectively ob-
fuscating the mapping of channel variations to motion in the
environment. In order to engineer a countermeasure from this,
the defender can address either the eavesdropper’s threshold
ﬁnding step or the actual motion sensing. From these two ap-
proaches, we can already formulate possible goals on desired
effects of the countermeasure: (i) Make the adversary pick
an overly high threshold such that environmental variation
does not trigger detection. (ii) Let the adversary observe a
strongly varying wireless channel such that the effect of human
motion cannot be distinguished well. Additionally, since the
adversary is passive, the defender is assumed to be unaware
of the attack. Thus, we conclude that (iii) the defense needs
to operate continuously.
A question yet to be answered is how the IRS needs to
be conﬁgured to effectively hamper the adversarial detection.
Recall from Section III that the attack is based on a sliding-
window standard deviation of channel responses where tem-
poral ﬂuctuations in the strength of channel variation triggers
detection. Therefore, to mimic the effect of human motion, we
conclude that the strength of IRS-induced channel variation
should exhibit randomized temporal changes.

conﬁgurations.
Therefore, we pursue the following probabilistic approach
where we gradually change the IRS conﬁguration. Given an
arbitrary initial set {rm}, in the ﬁrst step, we start by inverting
a small amount of randomly chosen elements, e. g., 5 % of all
256 elements. In the next step, we invert all 256 elements and
go back to the beginning to repeat the procedure. Thereby,
the IRS conﬁguration will change gradually but random and
similarly will the amplitude of the resulting IRS signal, thus
yielding smooth amplitude gradients. The intuition behind
inverting the IRS conﬁguration is the resulting 180° phase
shift of HIRS(k, t), i. e., when rm ∈ {−1, 1}, we can factor
out −1 in Eq. (7) such that H (0)
IRS(k, t). Thus,
in combination with the non-IRS propagation in Eq. (2), a
surface inversion will yield strong amplitude changes in the
wireless channel.
IRS(k, t) = −H (1)
We implement the outlined conﬁguration strategy as further
described by Algorithm 1. The algorithm leverages a state
machine to switch back and forth between changing a small
number of elements and inverting all elements. Additionally,
the algorithm timing is randomized by skipping the state
transition with a probability Phold, with which the IRS con-
ﬁguration remains unchanged. In this way, gaps in the IRS
operation cause drops in channel variation which enhance the
median absolute deviation in Eq. (6).
We test the effectiveness of the algorithm and place an
IRS close, i. e., 30 cm, to the anchor position 2, and record
channel observations of the eavesdropper at position A without
any motion in the target environment. We ﬁrst conduct a
reference measurement with the IRS being disabled. Then,
we use Algorithm 1 to conﬁgure the IRS at an update rate of
20 conﬁgurations/sec, and record channel measurements with
Phold = 0 and Phold = 0.6. We plot the results as time series
in Fig. 6. With the IRS being inactive, the channel remains
static as expected. However, as can be seen from the plot,
the IRS operation succeeds to produce strong time variations.
Furthermore, the effect of Phold is evident from pronounced
excursions with low channel variation. As our results show,
the IRS conﬁguration algorithm meets the requirement
to
generate channel variations of varying strength. We provide
additional insight and experimental results on the algorithm
parametrization in Appendix A.
V. RESULTS
In this section, we experimentally investigate how IRShield
affects adversarial motion detection. Further, we examine the
effect of size, distance, and orientation of the IRS.
A. Human Motion Sensing
Putting the IRShield channel obfuscation to test, we next
investigate its impact on the detection of motion. Therefore,
we repeat the human-motion sensing experiments from Sec-
tion III, this time with IRShield in place. Here, we again
use the experimental setup illustrated in Fig. 3, indicating a
walking path and positions of the anchor device, the IRS, and
Fig. 5. Intelligent reﬂecting surface prototype (43 × 35 cm). Back side with
control circuitry (left) and front side with reﬂecting elements (right).
B. Experimental Setup
For a ﬁrst exploration of IRS-based channel obfuscation, we
employ a prototypical IRS (see Fig. 5) with 256 binary-phase
tunable identical unit cell elements arranged in a 16×16 array
on a 43 × 35 cm standard FR4 PCB substrate. The unit
cell [9] consists of a rectangular reﬂector patch whose RF
reﬂection coefﬁcient can be electronically switched by means
of a PIN diode to add a parasitic element to the reﬂector.
By switching a bias voltage to the diode either on or off, the
reﬂection coefﬁcient of each IRS element can be individually
switched between values represented by a ‘0’ state (off) and
a ‘1’ state (on). The corresponding voltages are generated by
means of cascaded shift registers, digitally controlled using a
microcontroller. Leveraging a standard USB connection for
serial communication, the surface’s RF reﬂection behavior
is elegantly programmed from a host computer via 256 bit
words. The IRS used in our experiments is optimized to
achieve a 180° phase shift at around 5.35 GHz in the reﬂected
wave when switching between the ‘0’ and ‘1’ states, i. e.,
rm ∈ {−1, 1} in Eq. (2).
C. IRS Conﬁguration Strategy
We now proceed with the design of a plug-and-play conﬁgu-
ration strategy to achieve IRS-based channel obfuscation in the
ﬁeld. Within the eavesdropper’s channel response, cf. Eq. (2),
the contribution of the IRS is given as
M(cid:88)
HIRS(k, t) =
rm(t)G(cid:48)
m(k, t).
(7)
m=1
Here we can see that the M individual IRS reﬂection co-
efﬁcients rm(t) adjust the multipath components G(cid:48)
m(k, t).
The key observation to be made is that the signal amplitude
from superposition of the multipath components in Eq. (7)
depends on the IRS conﬁguration. Thus, the amplitude of the
eavesdropper’s observation, cf. Eq. (2), will likewise depend
on the IRS. It should be noted that the mapping of speciﬁc IRS
conﬁgurations to a particular channel response is non-trivial.
As we here consider a binary-phase tunable IRS with 256 ele-
ments, there are 2256 possible realizations of HIRS(k, t). In
view of the large design space and the unknown channels

observation. We plot the channel sliding-window standard deviation with and
without IRShield.
the eavesdropper. For the IRS, we use the setup described
in Section IV-B. Initially, the eavesdropper gathers a 3 min
long reference measurement without any motion to determine
a motion-detection threshold, however, observing not only
the steady environment but also the time-varying IRS. Next,
with the IRS still active, the eavesdropper records channel
measurements while a person walks along the pre-deﬁned path.
In Fig. 7, we plot the results from four combinations of
anchor-eavesdropper positions as time series, showing the
reference measurement without motion, the resulting detection
threshold according to [37], and the measurement with motion.
As the baseline, we additionally plot the results without the
IRS countermeasure, as presented in Fig. 4. When comparing
results without IRShield, the ﬁrst thing to note is that the
adversary fails to detect motion in almost every case. This is
because the adversary’s reference measurement is degraded by
the defender’s IRS-induced channel variation, resulting in an
excessively high threshold value. For anchor position 1, Fig. 7a
and 7b show the results when Eve is located at positions A
and B, respectively. In this case, the reference observation
without motion strongly overlaps with the curve corresponding
to motion. Thus, we conclude that our countermeasure renders
adversarial wireless motion detection infeasible – even when
adjusting the threshold. However,
the situation is slightly
different when considering less favorable anchor placement,
e. g., anchor position 2 with a large LOS, for which we
show the results in Fig. 7c and 7d. In this case, the IRS
operation affects the adversary’s threshold ﬁnding such that
motion is poorly detected. However,
it appears that LOS
crossings may in principle still be detectable if the adversary
is aware of the channel obfuscation and accordingly adjusts
the threshold. Thus, we conclude that the effect of IRShield,
just like the attack itself, is location-dependent. Therefore, we
next systematically study spatial dependencies.
B. Systematic Coverage Tests
As we have outlined previously, due to the varying strength
of different RF propagation paths,
the adversarial motion
sensing is subject to location-dependent performance and this
likewise appears to be the case for our IRS-based countermea-
sure. Therefore, we now seek to answer where in the target
area motion can be detected.
For this, we test a total of 20 positions within the target
area. For each of the positions, distributed on a uniform grid
throughout the target area (see Fig. 21 in Appendix B), we
place a rotating reﬂector as a point source of repeatable and
RF-relevant motion. The reﬂector is a 50 × 50 cm aluminum
sheet, mounted on a motor to rotate at approx. 20 rpm.
After an initial 3 min long reference measurement without
any motion in the target area, we record the adversary’s
channel observations from a particular anchor device with the
rotating reﬂector at each of the 20 positions. We repeat this
procedure with and without IRShield being active. To quantify
the adversary’s success, we use the motion-detection rate
using a threshold found from the initial reference measurement
according to [37]. The detection rate is given as the fraction
of total motion observations that lie above the threshold.
For anchor position 1 and two eavesdropper positions,
we show the spatial distribution of detection rates without
(Figs. 8a and 8c) and with (Figs. 8b and 8d) the IRS being
active. Without
the countermeasure, as expected, we can
observe the highest detection rates within and around the
LOS. Far off the LOS, the detection rate drops down to 0 %.
This effect is best visible in Fig. 8a: Due to the adversary’s
strong LOS signal, the sensitivity for weaker (environment-
dependent) multipath signals is reduced. In contrast, when the
IRS is active, the adversarial detection is completely suspended
as evident from the 0 % detection rate at all positions.
For the same eavesdropper positions and for anchor po-
sition 2 (large LOS), we show the results in Fig. 9. While
Fig. 9a again highlights the attack’s LOS-dependent coverage,
the diagonal LOS through the target area in Fig. 9c allows
the eavesdropper to obtain 100 % detection rate on each posi-
tion. Even for this challenging scenario, our countermeasure

Threshold adjustments. We evaluated the speciﬁc threshold
ﬁnding of the original attack as proposed by [37]. However,
choosing the threshold less conservative will slightly improve
the detection rates. For each of the four combinations of anchor
and eavesdropper positions, Table II lists the average detection
rates for varying motion-detection thresholds. For the state-of-
the-art attack [37], IRShield lowered detection rates to 5 %
or less, as can be seen from the last row, with C = 11
in Eq. (6), corresponding to Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. The ﬁrst row,
