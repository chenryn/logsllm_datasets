Many individuals believe they understand a particular method, but when they attempt to recreate the exact conditions, they often find that their method fails. The concept of the "False Conclusion" was effectively used in the FBI/DarkMarket sting operation. The FBI did not engage in any illegal activities; however, they created the illusion that they had, thereby gaining the trust of the criminals. For example, when an FBI agent purchased some credit card accounts, he reported them to the financial institution, which then shut down the accounts, citing "fraud" as the reason. Other criminals, who had access to merchant accounts, saw this status and assumed the FBI agent had indeed used the cards fraudulently, thus trusting him.

A simple example of a False Conclusion in the context of malware is placing a string inside the code that suggests it originated from another source, or by launching an attack from an IP address in a different country than the actual attacker. There have been reports of a Shockwave file containing two attachments: the EICAR test virus and actual malware. This can deceive both software and human analysts.

The False Conclusion is highly effective in deceptive attacks, as will be further detailed later. Magicians often reveal, expose, or suggest one technique, especially if a superior method is available. This approach is also useful in hacking, as it explains how an action could occur and indirectly leads the victim to a false conclusion. It serves as misdirection, encouraging the victim to investigate the inferior method, thereby delaying the discovery of the true solution.

Another common technique is to employ multiple methods to achieve the same effect, particularly if the effect is repeated. If someone is familiar with one technique and sees that it cannot be used in all cases, they may conclude that it was not used in any of the cases. In hacking, an attacker might have three different ways to gain access to a system. If the victim discovers and fixes one, and the attacker still gains access, the victim may incorrectly conclude that the fixed exploit was not the method used.

Magicians also use distraction by switching a gaffed or fake object for the real one. If the object appears normal upon examination, it seems impossible to have been used for the illusion. Malware that deletes itself after execution is an example of such a switch.

Magicians may also hide the true workings of an illusion by destroying the gaff or fake, or by removing any evidence. However, there should be a logical reason for the destruction to avoid suspicion. In hacking, some attackers wipe out system logs to hide forensic evidence. A completely empty log file is suspicious, whereas a log with a few gaps is more difficult to detect. Another technique is to use social engineering to obtain evidence, such as creating a forged email detailing how evidence will be gathered. The victim may unknowingly provide the evidence to the attacker, thus "destroying" it.

Now that you understand the basic principles, let's create a scenario that combines several techniques in a deceptive manner, similar to how a magician combines various techniques for a single illusion.

**Scenario: Extracting Intellectual Property from XYZ Company**

An attacker aims to extract the contents of a large and valuable database of intellectual property from the XYZ Company. The theft must remain undetected during and after the extraction, and there are time constraints. The attacker is already inside the network and has several zero-day exploits, including the least valuable one, called the Fizbin Drop. This exploit is constructed to appear as normal as possible.

One key attribute of the Fizbin Drop is found in a binary object inserted into a Microsoft Word document, known as the Decoy File. This file contains an exploit and a payload, which will be discussed later. It is harmless and used solely for deception.

The necessary tools and decoys are placed within the network. Gimmicks and fakes are installed, waiting for use. The external website is modified so that new files can be uploaded and made to appear with a simple "sleight."

The audience is scanned for a suitable target. Unlucky Lucy, a database administrator, is identified. Files are hidden in her directory, barely visible but detectable with a detailed scan. Lucy also has a process for distributing files to other computers, which is gaffed to allow special files to be placed in the outgoing queue.

Meanwhile, profiles on web forums are created using Lucy's name, posting unusual opinions. The daily backup of the database is typically incremental, but this is modified to make larger backups less suspicious.

The details of the Fizbin Drop are released on Full Disclosure, prompting hackers to write exploits and antivirus companies to develop signatures. After a delay, a press release is sent to the media, falsely announcing that XYZ Company will provide adult services. This happens late on a Friday, giving the media time to react.

The hacker then sends a command to the gaffed web server, making new pages and files visible on the company's external website. The CEO is woken by a panicked call about the faked press release, leading to a public relations crisis. A team is gathered, and a second press release is issued denying the incident.

The new files on the external website are discovered, and rumors spread that the CEO is a sexual conservative, disagreeing with the company's direction. The security team shuts down the site and conducts an internal audit, finding anomalies in the logs that appear to come from inside the company.

An anonymous email to Innocent Ivy, another system administrator, describes how Lucy was making comments on a public forum about the profitability of porn and a "big announcement." Ivy reports this, and the hacker replicates the Decoy files throughout the network, seemingly via Lucy's account. Some malware creation files are also placed in Ivy's account.

The hacker sends a threatening email to Lucy, apparently from Ivy, causing Lucy to suspect Ivy. An internal audit reveals porn files in Lucy's home directory, leading to her dismissal. HR thanks Ivy for helping identify the culprit. A Google search shows Lucy's apparent interest in porn, and she denies everything, suggesting Ivy might be responsible.

The new antivirus signatures are installed, triggering alarms indicating a massive virus infection. The Decoy file is found on everyone's computer, opening connections to an outside website and sending large amounts of random data, mimicking the export of intellectual property.

Porn files are also found in Ivy's account, and an email suggests Ivy dislikes Lucy. Ivy is dismissed, leading to confusion and distrust. The CEO prefers simple answers, even if contradictory.

The internal staff is in turmoil, and the sudden departure of Lucy and Ivy leaves the support staff in chaos. The database servers seem to be operating normally, but everyone is busy trying to stop the virus and find out what is happening.

During the chaos, the hacker poisons the DNS cache to redirect the remote backup server to a new IP address and ensures a full backup of the database. These changes are small and go unnoticed. Once the backup is complete, the hacker performs a switch, removing all traces of the modifications and returning the system to normal.

Days later, when the crisis is averted and the systems patched, no one realizes the theft of information. The hacker still has ways into the system, always keeping another "Ace up his sleeve."

**Conclusion:**

This scenario demonstrates how the skills of magicians can be used in a deceptive way to minimize the risk of detection. Key takeaways include:

- **Stronger Protection for Administrators:** Those with administrative rights need stronger protection and a robust audit trail.
- **Avoid Single Points of Failure:** Use teams and ensure at least two members are familiar with every active defense response.
- **Focused Response Teams:** When reacting to active attacks, use focused teams and do not leave other resources undefended.
- **Tolerant View for Accusations:** Administrators need a more tolerant view if accused of wrongdoing. Human Resources should not determine guilt or innocence without thorough investigation.
- **Digitally Signed Press Releases:** Press releases should be digitally signed to prevent forgery.
