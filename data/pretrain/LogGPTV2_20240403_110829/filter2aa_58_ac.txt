think they understand the method, but when they try to re-create the 
exact conditions, they find out that their method doesn’t work.  
The False Conclusion was used by the FBI/DarkMarket sting 
operation.32 The FBI did not perform any illegal action. However, they 
were able to create the illusion that they did, and therefore gain the 
criminal’s trust. For example, when the FBI agent purchased some 
credit card accounts, he reported them to the financial organization, 
which then shut the accounts down, citing the reason as “fraud.” The 
other criminals, who had a merchant account, saw this status on the 
number, and assumed the FBI agent did use the cards fraudulently, 
and was therefore trusted. 
A very simple example is to place a string inside malware that 
suggests the malware came from another source, or by attacking a 
system from an IP address from a country different from the attacker.  
There have been reports of a Shockwave file that has two 
attachments. The first is the EICAR test virus, and the second is actual 
malware.33  This can fool both programs and humans. 
This False Conclusion is extremely effective in deceptive attacks, as 
will be described later. 
 – Magicians may 
reveal, expose, or suggest one technique, especially if there is a 
superior method available. These techniques are also useful in 
hacking, as you will see later. This is related to the False Conclusion, 
as it explains how an action could occur, and indirectly makes the 
victim assume a false conclusion. It also acts as misdirection, because 
it will encourage the victim to investigate if the inferior method was 
used. This delays the discovery of the proper solution. 
 – Another common technique is 
to have multiple methods to accomplish the same effect, especially if 
the effect is repeated. Someone familiar with one technique will see 
that it cannot be used in all cases. They therefore conclude that it was 
not used in any of the cases. 
In hacking, an attacker may have three different ways to get into a 
system. The victim may find one, and fix this. If the attacker then gets 
access to the system, the victim may conclude that this exploit was 
not the method used to gain access.

 – Magicians will also distract the 
audience by switching a gaffed or fake object for the real object. If the 
object is examined, and is normal, it could not possibly be used for 
the illusion.  Or so it seems. Malware that deletes itself is an example 
of a switch. 
– Magicians will 
hide the true workings of an illusion by destroying the gaff or fake, or 
by removing any evidence. However, there should be a logical reason 
for the destruction, or else this will seem suspicious. In hacking some 
hackers wipe out the system logs to hide the forensics evidence. If the 
evidence can be destroyed without being obvious, it is much more 
deceptive.  A system log file that is empty is suspicious. A system log 
with a few gaps in the record is harder to detect. 
Another technique is to use social engineering to obtain evidence, 
such as creating a forged e-mail detailing how evidence will be 
gathered. The victim may then give the evidence to the attacker 
unknowingly, thus “destroying” it. 
Now that you understand the basic principles, this paper will create 
a scenario that combines several techniques in a deceptive manner, as 
a magician will combine several techniques for a single illusion.  
Let’s assume that the attacker wants to extract the contents of a 
large and valuable database of intellectual property from the XYZ 
Company. However, there are three problems: a) the theft must be 
undetected during the theft, as the attempt will be aborted. b) The 
theft should be undiscovered, as the data becomes more valuable.  c) 
There are time constraints. A slow extraction using steganography 
would take too long. 
Let’s also assume the attacker is inside the network.   
Here’s how it can be done. 
Our attacker has several zero-day exploits. Let’s call the least 
valuable exploit in the attacker’s collection the Fizbin Drop. Like a 
magician mastering sleights, the exploits are mastered until perfected. 
This means that they are constructed to appear as normal as possible.

In addition, one of the key attributes, or evidence, of the Fizbin 
Drop is found in a binary object, inserted into a Microsoft Word 
document. Let’s call this file the Decoy File. It will be used later. It has 
an exploit, and a payload, which we will discuss later. It’s harmless, 
and used just for deception. 
The props needed are placed inside the network. Gaffs and 
gimmicks and fakes are installed, waiting for use. The gimmicks are 
unseen, the gaffs appear normal, and the fakes are not closely 
examined. The external web site has been gaffed so that new files can 
be uploaded onto the server, and then after they are uploaded, they 
can be made to appear with a simple “sleight.” 
The audience is scanned, looking for a suitable stooge. Some 
preparations are done, and the hacker is now ready for the next phase. 
Someone, whom we will call Unlucky Lucy, is one of the people 
responsible for the database.  Another system administrator is Ivy. But 
we’ll talk about her later. 
Files are placed in Lucy’s directory, hidden, but just barely. They  
can’t been seen by a casual observation, but a detailed scan will reveal 
these files (gimmicks). 
Lucy also has a process where she can execute the distributing of 
certain files to other computers. This process is gaffed, so special files 
can be placed in the outgoing queue. 
Meanwhile, profiles on web forums are created with Lucy’s name. 
Some unusual opinions are posted in these public forums (
). 
Some more work has to be done. The daily backup of the database 
is typically incremental (only new changes) instead of complete 
(copying all data). This has to be modified so that larger backups are 
not considered unusual (
). 
Now’s the time for the real misdirection to begin. Details of the 
Fizbin Drop are released on Full Disclosure.34 Hackers start writing 
exploits. Anti-Virus companies start developing signatures. It will take

a few days before the signatures come out. (
). 
Next, after an appropriate delay, a press release is sent to the 
media. It announces that due to declining revenue, the XYZ Company 
will be providing services for the Adult industry. In other words, porn. 
This happens Late Friday, giving time for the media to contemplate 
the news. And of course XYZ does not provide a public key that can be 
used to verify the press release.  
And this point, the hacker sends a special command to the gaffed 
web server, which then modified some pages so some new pages and 
files are now visible on the XYZ Company’s external web site. 
And the backups on the database increase in size. 
The CEO is woken by a phone call from someone in a panic, telling 
him about the faked press release.35 “Is this real?” they ask. This is 
obviously a Public Relations nightmare. A team is gathered, and 
another press release is sent out denying the entire incident. 
Meanwhile, those new files on the external web site are discovered. 
Some anonymous email, some tweets, and some blog posts discuss the 
interesting news that the web site now offers some adult services, 
along with some extremely revealing pictures. 
The CEO is again awoken to discover that his web site now has 
adult pictures, thereby proving the first Press Release was entirely 
accurate. In addition, another press release comes out announcing the 
new section on the web site where these services are available. It also 
provides the public key which can be used to verify the authenticity of 
the digitally signed press release. This key, by the way, is also found 
on other external web servers. Perhaps the hacker even gets the new 
press release on the company’s web site where press releases are 
published. 
Bloggers are saying this is a publicity stunt. Other bloggers are 
spreading rumors that the CEO is a sexual conservative, and that he is 
in disagreement with the others in the direction of the company. In

other words, the second press release is wrong, and the first and third 
are correct.  
The security team has shut down the site with porn, and then does 
an internal audit, trying to find out how these files appeared on the 
web site. They noticed several anomalies in the logs, and they appear 
to have come from someone inside the company. They investigate 
further. 
Meanwhile, another anonymous email comes in, addressed to 
Innocent Ivy, describing how one of the employees of the company 
was making comments on a public forum about “nothing wrong with 
porn” and how it’s profitable, and how “expect a big announcement.” 
And the email states that the name associated with the external 
account is the same as Unlucky Lucy. Ivy reports this. (
).  
Also – using some sleight-of-hand, those Decoy files are replicated 
throughout the company’s network, apparently by way of Unlucky 
Lucy’s account. Some of the files associated with the creation of the 
malware are also placed in Ivy’s account,  
The hacker also sends a nasty email to Lucy, apparently from Ivy. 
Lucy is shocked that Ivy did this. Ivy is of course Innocent of this. 
Well, an internal audit reveals that some of the porn files on the 
web site are also in Lucy’s home directory. That’s strong evidence that 
Lucy was responsible for the web site hack, and hR thanks Ivy for 
helping identify the culprit. A Google search shows Lucy’s apparent 
interest in porn.  
Of course Lucy denies it, but the evidence is strong. Lucy says she 
did get a strange email from Ivy, threatening her. Perhaps Ivy did it? 
The HR person obviously thinks Lucy is lying to save her job, and 
looks at Lucy with pity. This is, or course, 
and
Meanwhile the new anti-virus signatures are installed. Alarms are 
going off everywhere, indicating massive virus infection. The Decoy 
file is found on everyone’s computer. They also trigger some malware 
that opens up a connection to an outside web site, and sends large 
amounts of information. The data is all random, but look like

someone trying to export massive amount of intellectual property.. 
This is a 
. 
And now it is discovered that the porn files are also found in 
Innocent Ivy’s account. And that Ivy dislikes Lucy, according to the 
eMail. Apparently Innocent Ivy isn’t (
In summary, we have the following events going on. 
 The CEO is trying to deal with the aftermath of the fake press 
release. Many think this is just a publicity stunt, because of the 
clear evidence that Adult services were available on their external 
web site. People are still trying to determine which of the press 
releases are right and which ones were faked. 
 Lucy is ejected from the company immediately, at the CEO’s 
insistence.  She denies everything, and the best thing she can do is 
say she thinks Ivy was responsible. But Ivy helped identify Lucy.  
 A massive virus is propagating through the network. During the 
clean-up, they discover that the source code of the virus is found in 
Ivy’s directory. Ivy is dismissed with cause, despite denying 
everything.  
 Of course firing Ivy causes problems because they just fired Lucy 
because of what Ivy said. But if Ivy is the guilty party, perhaps Lucy 
is innocent. But she has already been fired. Now they have to worry 
about wrongful termination lawsuits. More importantly, they begin 
to distrust their decisions, and perhaps the evidence of the porn 
and malware infection is flawed. The simple answer is that Ivy and 
Lucy are responsible. CEO’s like simple answers, even if they are 
contradictory.  
 The internal staff is in turmoil. The sudden departure of Lucy and 
Ivy left the support staff in chaos. They disabled the accounts of 
these sys-admins, and quickly found someone to assume their 
responsibility.  The database servers Lucy and Ivy were responsible 
for seem to be operating normally, which is good, because everyone 
is busy trying to stop the virus while trying to find out what is 
happening. Friends of Ivy and Lucy don’t quite know what to 
believe, and they think these great co-workers were fired for no 
reason.  Perhaps they may be terminated next, because no one is 
telling them what Lucy and Ivy are guilty of. And they are certainly 
not going to argue with the decision makers, because the decisions 
are coming from “up high.”

 Essentially there are so many crises occurring that small, slightly 
abnormal events aren’t noticed.    
Meanwhile, the hacker has done two small things. He has poisoned 
the DNS cache so that the remote backup server now has a new IP 
address. The second is that the hacker makes sure a full backup of the 
complete database occurs. This will allow the entire contents of the 
database to be exported. These are very small changes in the day-to-
day operation. Perhaps Lucy and/or Ivy might have detected this. 
Others might, if they weren’t so busy during the chaos. 
When this is done, the hacker performs a switch, and the two 
changes he made to the system vanish, and the system is returned to 
normal. No trace of the modifications can be found, and the log files 
show nothing unusual. Examining the log files show nothing outside 
of the normal actions. If the company does egress detection, the noise 
generated by the malware hide the activity of the database extraction. 
Days later, when the crisis is averted, and the systems patched, no 
one realizes the theft of information happened.  
The hacker still has ways into the system, because he always keeps 
another Ace up his sleeve.

This scenario demonstrates that the skills of magicians can be used in a 
deceptive way to minimize the risk of detection. In addition, it also shows  
 Those with administration rights need stronger protection 
from attacks, and a stronger audit trail. They are valuable 
assets, and extremely vulnerable. 
 Don’t have single points of failure in the defensive teams. 
Use teams, and make sure there are at least two familiar 
with every active defense response. 
 If reacting to active attacks, use focused teams. Don’t 
apply all of your resources, and don’t leave other 
resources undefended. 
 Administrators need a more tolerant view if accused of 
wrong-doing. The people in Human Resources are not 
qualified to determine guilt or innocence. Make sure they
