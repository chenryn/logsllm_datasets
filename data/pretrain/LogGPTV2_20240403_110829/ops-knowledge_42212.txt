User: I'm currently toying with python at home and I'm planning to switch to python 3.1. The fact is that I have some scripts that use python 2.6 and I can't convert them since they use some modules that aren't available for python 3.1 atm. So I'm considering installing python 3.1 along with my python 2.6. I only found people on the internet that achieve that by compiling python from the source and use make altinstall instead of the classic make install. Anyway, I think compiling from the source is a bit complicated. I thought running two different versions of a program is easy on Linux (I run fedora 11 for the record). Any hint?
Thanks for reading.
Assistant: You're not supposed to need to run them together.
2.6 already has all of the 3.0 features.  You can enable those features with from __future__ import statements.
It's much simpler run 2.6 (with some from __future__ import) until everything you need is in 3.x, then switch.
