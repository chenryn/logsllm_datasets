### Issue with Heading Margins in Panel Headings

**Description:**
The `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` tags within panel headings are currently set with the following margins:
- `margin-top: 20px;`
- `margin-bottom: 10px;`

For `h4`, `h5`, and `h6` tags, the margins are:
- `margin-top: 10px;`
- `margin-bottom: 10px;`

These settings result in an undesirable visual appearance.

**Proposed Solution:**
To address this issue, we have two options:

1. **Create a New Rule for Panel Headings:**
   - Define a new CSS rule specifically for headings within panel headings to adjust the margins.
   - For example:
     ```css
     .panel-heading h1, .panel-heading h2, .panel-heading h3 {
         margin-top: 10px;
         margin-bottom: 5px;
     }
     .panel-heading h4, .panel-heading h5, .panel-heading h6 {
         margin-top: 5px;
         margin-bottom: 5px;
     }
     ```

2. **Evaluate Usage:**
   - Assess whether the current settings are used frequently enough to justify creating a new rule.
   - If the usage is minimal, it may not be necessary to create a new rule, and the existing settings can be adjusted directly.

**Recommendation:**
- If the current settings are causing significant visual issues, creating a new rule for panel headings is recommended.
- If the usage is minimal, consider adjusting the existing settings directly or providing a more general solution.

Please provide feedback on the proposed solutions or any additional context that might help in making a decision.
