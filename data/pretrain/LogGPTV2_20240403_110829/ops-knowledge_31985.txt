**Scenario:**

I have a Google App Engine (GAE) project with multiple modules (A, B, and C) that share a common user database and session management. Module A is responsible for handling login and logout actions using cookies, while Modules B and C handle other functionalities. These modules are developed in both PHP and Python.

**Objective:**

I want to avoid duplicating user and session verification code across all three modules. Instead, I am looking for a way to implement a middleware that runs before each request to all modules. This middleware, letâ€™s call it X, should perform the following tasks:
- Authenticate the user.
- Add specific headers to the request, such as `X-User-Id` and `X-User-Scopes`, if the user is authenticated.

**Desired Workflow:**

Each incoming request should follow one of these paths:
1. **X, A**: The middleware X processes the request, then it is passed to Module A.
2. **X, B**: The middleware X processes the request, then it is passed to Module B.
3. **X, C**: The middleware X processes the request, then it is passed to Module C.

**Middleware Details:**

The middleware X should be language-agnostic, meaning it should work seamlessly with both PHP and Python modules. It should be configured in the `app.yaml` file and should only modify the request by adding the necessary headers after performing authentication.

**Example Implementation:**

In a Python-only project, I previously used a custom handler that inherits from `webapp2.RequestHandler`. In the overridden `dispatch()` method, I collected and stored the user information in the handler object itself. This custom handler was implemented in a single, version-controlled file, which was symlinked into each module directory. This approach ensured that the user and session verification code was centralized and did not need to be duplicated across multiple modules.

However, I am now seeking a solution that can work with both PHP and Python modules in my GAE project.

Thank you for any suggestions or guidance on how to achieve this.
