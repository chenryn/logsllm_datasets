2.5 Summary of results
We show that the OFDM configurations that offer the highest ro-
bustness, i.e., BPSK and 4-QAM, are prone to ED/LC attacks. We
provide mathematical proof that irrespective of the number of sub-
carriers, the first quarter and first half of the symbol allow the
attacker to learn the full BPSK or 4-QAM symbol, respectively.
In the case of BPSK, every symbol can be late-committed with
only half the samples. For BPSK, the most robust constellation,
the susceptibility to both early-detection and late-commit attack
leads to a deterministically achievable distance reduction of more
than 200m for a typical 802.11 OFDM configuration of 20MHz split
into 64 subcarriers. In the case of 4-QAM, we show that an at-
tacker’s late-commit success can be significantly improved with
an optimization technique, resulting in a considerable adversarial
advantage in a distance-reducing attack. We identify the structure
of the frequency-domain constellation grid as the main enabler of
strong early-detection strategies and identify a technique that uses
orthogonal noise and a random phase shift as a possible counter-
measure since those operations limit structural information about
the frequency-domain constellation.
3 THE OFDM ED/LC ATTACK
In the context of ToF distance measurement, it is well-known that an
attacker can exploit the time-redundancy of symbols to decrease the
measured distance, irrespective of cryptographic primitives [11, 20].
For example, if a modulation uses repetitions of a certain signal
shape for improved robustness, an attacker can early-detect this
symbol by only decoding the first repetition and can late-commit to
such a symbol by only transmitting the last repetition. This behavior
is illustrated in Figure 5. For the outcome of such an attack, it is
not important whether the symbols are sent in direct succession or
in separate frames. It is, however, not straightforward how such an
attacker performs in OFDM since the symbols are encoded in the
frequency domain and only before transmission transformed into a
time-domain symbol. The physical-layer attacker presents us with
a heavy asymmetry in the information-theoretic sense between
the attacker’s observation and the verifiable information at the
receiver (prover and verifier). An attacker can “understand” and
interact with the signal at the physical layer, while the receiver will
only be able to assess the validity of the signal after demodulating
it into bits. This demodulation must be robust against noise and
multi-path channel propagation for reliable operations over long
communication ranges, and we do not want to break with this
requirement.
3.1 Attacker model
As mentioned in Section 2.2.1, we assume a Mafia Fraud attack
scenario, where the external attacker is located between the two
legitimate entities that measure their relative distance via signal
time-of-flight (ToF). The attacker’s goal is to decrease the measured
time of arrival of the communication protocol employing an early-
detect/late-commit (ED/LC) attack or a similar technique. While
an attacker could also work on the protocol/data-layer, in the fol-
lowing, we constrain ourselves with an attacker that operates on
the symbol level. If not taken care of at the physical layer, such an
attacker can be successful irrespective of cryptographic primitives

duce the measured time-of-arrival by identifying the sym-
bol based on its initial samples and sending the later part of
the symbol early.
bridge this gap and thus assist the standardization effort by provid-
ing a rigorous physical-layer analysis that can motivate the choice
of the modulation for the symbol sequences used for ToA estimation.
This allows extending the security argument to a physical-layer
attacker that is not constrained with regard to reaction time.
2.4 Known principles clash with
implementation and performance
constraints
Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is an important signal
property for performant operation in real-world systems. The rea-
son is that fast changes in the signal (the opposite of low PAPR)
are challenging to amplify without encountering non-linearities
of the hardware, causing inter-carrier interference and limiting
overall performance (i.e., communication distance). Due to power
constraints, many end devices have amplifiers optimized for effi-
ciency, which makes them, in turn, highly nonlinear. Therefore,
OFDM uses different techniques to limit the PAPR. One of them
is to limit the codeset and exclude high-PAPR symbols, of which
pulses are the most extreme examples.
On the other hand, existing proposals for modulations enabling
secure time-of-arrival measurement all assume pulses that are
spaced by more than the channel delay-spread [17]. The existing
understanding of secure physical layer design for ranging and the
requirements on practical OFDM systems cannot be reconciled
without either a heavy performance (data rate, range) penalty or
hardware changes. E.g., [25] makes a proposal to use a multicar-
rier system like a single-carrier (UWB-like) system, a technique
that provides security, however heavily constrains the information
content per symbol and relies on time-domain techniques at the
receiver. The question addressed in this work is to investigate the
security of multicarrier modulations in general and whether we
can find a technique that allows for secure ranging within the prac-
tical OFDM assumptions, those being parallel transmission on all
subcarriers and frequency-domain mapping and demapping.

Figure 5: OFDM distance-reduction attack. If the attacker can understand the symbol based on a number of initial samples, he

and protocols (such as distance bounding) on higher layers. More-
over, we assume an attacker that can receive and react to signals
at the physical layer at arbitrarily high sensitivity and arbitrarily
small reaction times. We understand that this is an unattainable
attacker model in the real world; however, in order to account for
future technological advances, we do not want to limit ourselves to
the current state-of-the-art results. As the attacker’s aim is distance
reduction, we assume the attacker has full control over his signal
power, and the legitimate signal is negligible in relative power. This
naturally applies in a scenario where the legitimate devices are out
of communication range, however, an attacker can relay signals,
e.g., by wire (relay attack). This provides the attacker the advantage
of amplifying the signal as needed and, in particular, establishing a
communication path, whereas in reality, the victim devices might
be out of range. This attacker model is in line with the ones chosen
in recent proposals for secure ToF estimation [17, 24].
3.2 Robust OFDM configurations
Performance-enhancing techniques such as channel compensation,
cyclic prefix, and coding can create additional vulnerability to an
ED/LC attacker since those techniques create dependencies be-
tween parts of the symbol. The absence of such techniques can be
compensated by using highly robust constellations for the symbol
sequences used for ToF estimation. For this reason, we cover the
two most robust constellations in our analysis.
3.2.1 BPSK. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) uses a maximally
robust symbol constellation. In BPSK, each subcarrier can only
assume one of two possible values: +1 or -1. Robustness is an impor-
tant characteristic and a key design goal on the bit sequences used
for ranging in recent standardization efforts [3, 5]. Unfortunately,
as opposed to the pulsed scenario, OFDM BPSK proves a particu-
larly bad choice regarding a distance-reducing attacker, especially
an early-detect late-commit (ED/LC) attacker. The reason is that a
limited set of constellation points in frequency-domain results in
strong time-domain symmetry. Because all ns frequency-domain
values are real, any BPSK symbol exhibits Hermitian symmetry in
time-domain. This means the last ns/2 − 1 time-domain samples
are complex-conjugated versions of the ns/2 − 1 samples after the
initial sample c0. Indeed, we will prove constructively that strong
late-commit sequences exist for all non-pulse BPSK symbols, re-
quiring an attacker to send only half the samples. In addition, we
will see that the time-domain samples contain a substantial amount
of differential information about the entire symbol, granting a steep
learning curve to the early-detecting attacker.
4-QAM. 4-QAM is the minimal constellation that transmits
3.2.2
bits on both signal-space dimensions in parallel, resulting in four
possible constellation points per tone. As a consequence, it provides
double the data rate, however at slightly less robustness under equal
overall signal strength, compared to BPSK.
3.3 Early-detection
An early-detecting attacker is looking for the algorithm that will
detect the correct message with highest probability, for a given
detection delay δed. The advantage of an early-detect algorithm
ED at detection delay δed over a symbol set B is defined as
(cid:16)

AED(B, δed) = P

and
cED = c0||...||cδed−1,
c = OFDM (b) .
In the following, we introduce two different viewpoints on early-
detection. The first is standard OFDM demodulation, which simply
applies an FFT on the zero-padded time-domain signal before test-
ing on the polarity of each tone. Then, we analyze a time-domain
sample-by-sample matching strategy, assuming an attacker with
optimal sensitivity. This second viewpoint shall grant insights
into optimized strategies, e.g., strategies that compensate for inter-
carrier-interference (ICI) imposed by the fact that later time-domain
samples are unknown, an effect that highly impacts standard de-
modulation.

Figure 6: All possible values of the first four time-domain samples of an BPSK OFDM symbol with eight subcarriers. Odd
samples are numerically diverse, i.e., contain a lot of information about the symbol sequence.
3.3.1 Direct demodulation. This approach feeds the early-detect
signal with trailing zeros into an OFDM demodulator. This is equiv-
alent to applying the FFT on the ideal symbol multiplied with a 1-0
step function. Doing so, the attacker directly maps the time-domain
samples to all frequency subcarriers in order to then detect the bits.
The shortcoming of this approach is that the ED condition (i.e., the
later samples being cut off) is equivalent to applying a sharp filter
in time domain, which corresponds to a wide (1/f) dispersion profile
in frequency domain. This means every bit is subject to significant
inter-carrier interference, which results in a relatively high bit error
rate. The computational complexity of this approach is given by
the FFT algorithm, i.e., O(ns log(ns)).
3.3.2 Number-theoretic viewpoint. In this section, we deal with
an idealized early-detection attacker that matches the observed
time-domain samples against all possible symbols. Security against
such an attacker can only be based on numerical ambiguity of the
initial samples. However, as we will show, the initial samples of
BPSK-modulated OFDM symbols contain a substantial amount of
information about the entire sequence—a fact directly related to
the FFT size being a power of two.
The set of possible time-domain values of each sample is limited,
as we illustrate in Figure 6. The figures show the possible values
that can be assumed by the first four time-domain samples for all
possible bit sequences of a BPSK OFDM symbol with eight subcar-
riers. We can observe that the odd samples (i.e., samples c1 and c3)
can assume many different distinct values because those are based
on a linear combination of all distinct complex exponentials. Nu-
merical matching exploits the systematic nature of the modulation,
i.e., the fact that the limited frequency-domain constellation points,
together with distinct complex exponentials, result in distinct nu-
merical time-domain samples. By analyzing the conditions under
which the numerical samples represent unique bit combinations, we
can arrive at a concrete upper bound of the number of time-domain
samples representing the bits of the symbol unambiguously.
Theorem 3.1. An attacker with infinite sensitivity operating on
a non-pulsed BPSK OFDM symbol2 (with ns = 2M for M ∈ Z>1)
requires at most ns/4 + 1 samples to detect the symbol.
The proof is provided in Appendix A. For BPSK, we show the
resulting bit error rate as a function of the early-detection delay
δed in Figure 7, and contrast it to direct demodulation. Our bound

detection.
pre-computed traces faces a space complexity of O(cid:16)3ns/2(cid:17). How-
A brute-force attacker that matches time-domain samples against
ever, it is expected that polynomial-time maximum likelihood detec-
tors exist. The fact that both the nature of the inter-carrier interfer-
ence and the possible constellation points are known to the attacker
makes a compelling case for the existence of efficient cancellation
techniques.
Furthermore, we can reduce the problem of ideal time-domain
matching in 4-QAM to the same problem on two interleaved BPSK
symbols.
Corollary 3.2. An attacker with infinite sensitivity operating
on a non-pulsed 4-QAM OFDM symbol3 requires at most ns/2 + 1
samples to detect the symbol.
Proof. Without loss of generality, an attacker can run the early-
detection on the signal that is circularly shifted by ns/4 to the
left and start the early-detection procedure ns/4 delayed. This is
equivalent to a multiplication of the frequency-domain represen-
tation by a sequence 1,−i,−1, i, .... Starting with c1, the attacker
can then separate every sample of the shifted representation in its
symmetric and antisymmetric components, which correspond to
the time-domain representation of the real and imaginary parts of
the frequency-domain symbols. These components are individu-
ally BPSK-modulated. Theorem 3.1 states that a non-pulsed BPSK

sequence despite the attacker omitting the first δlc samples of each
time-domain symbol. A ˆδlc-LC algorithm is optimal if there exists
no δlc-LC algorithm for δlc < ˆδlc.
In the following, we will constructively prove the existence of a
ns/2-LC algorithm for the full BPSK symbol set without c0-pulses,
i.e. for B′ = B \ P, whereas P = {±(1, 1, 1, ...)}.
3.4.1 Deterministic BPSK late-commit (ns/2-LC). As a consequence
of Hermitian symmetry, a late-committing attacker can generate
any non-pulse BPSK symbol using only the samples corresponding
to the second half of the symbol.
Theorem 3.3. There exists a ns/2-LC algorithm under the set of
all non-pulsed BPSK OFDM symbols.
The proof is provided in Appendix B. The critical observation
behind the proof is that the attacker’s first samples fully determines
the amount of real-valued inter-carrier interference under the late-
commit condition (i.e., the first ns/2 samples being zero). A small
decrease of this sample will decrease ICI more than the adverse
effect its reduction has on the amplitude values, which are essential
for correct BPSK detection.
