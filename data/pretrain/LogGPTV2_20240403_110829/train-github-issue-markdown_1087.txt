  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
When I tell a `` to be `placement='right'` I expected to be placed
to the right of the reference.
## Current Behavior
When I tell a `` to be `placement='right'` it is placed to the left
of the reference, even when visual space is available. However, it looks like
when one of its parent element is positioned (via `overflow` css property) is
causing this odd behavior.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Go to: https://codesandbox.io/s/x97mv2ljnq
  2. Hover the button and observe the tooltip appearing on the left instead of the right.
  3. Comment line 14 (`overflowX: 'auto'`).
  4. Hover the button and observe the tooltip appearing on the right as expected.

## Context
I need to wrap ``s inside `overflowX: 'auto'` elements to allow user
to horizontal scroll the contents when the table is wider than the viewport.
Therefore, I would like to be able to use the tooltip with my desired
placement being in the right of the reference (which is the last column of the
table).
