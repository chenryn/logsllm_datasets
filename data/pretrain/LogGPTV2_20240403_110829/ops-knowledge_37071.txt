User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Tomcat 6.0 service does not start: java/lang/NoClassDefFoundError I installed Tomcat on my Windows server but I can't get it to start. I start the service and I see the progress bar, but it fails.  

I installed the Java Runtime Environment Version 6 and created JRE_HOME Environment variable. (C:\Program Files\Java\jre6)

Below is the jakarta_serviceYYYMMDD.log entries:

[2010-04-08 14:22:42] [info] Commons Daemon procrun (1.0.2.0) started

[2010-04-08 14:22:42] [info] : java/lang/Object


How can I fix this problem?

Assistant: By the look of the error the Tomcat native launcher does not find the rt.jar file in your JRE install.

Make sure that:


the JVM is correctly installed;
the JRE_HOME variable points to it.
