ABSTRACT
Oversubscription increases the utilization of expensive power in-
frastructure in multi-tenant data centers, but it can create dangerous
emergencies and outages if the designed power capacity is exceeded.
Despite the safeguards in place today to prevent power outages,
this extended abstract demonstrates that multi-tenant data centers
are vulnerable to well-timed power attacks launched by a malicious
tenant (i.e., attacker). Further, we show that there is a physical side
channel — a thermal side channel due to hot air recirculation —
that contains information about the benign tenants’ runtime power
usage. We develop a state-augmented Kalman filter that guides an
attacker to precisely time its power attacks at moments that coin-
cide with the benign tenants’ high power demand, thus overloading
the designed power capacity. Our experimental results show that
an attacker can capture 53% of all attack opportunities, significantly
compromising the data center availability.
1 INTRODUCTION
Multi-tenant data centers are shared data center facilities where
tenants house their physical servers while the data center operator
is responsible for managing the non-IT support systems such as
power distribution and cooling. They are a very important segment
of data centers and adopted widely by many industry sectors. For
example, Apple has 25% of its servers in multi-tenant data centers.
As of today, there are nearly 2,000 multi-tenant data centers in the
U.S., consuming five times the energy of Google-type data centers
altogether.
To accommodate the fast growing Internet and cloud-based ser-
vices, multi-tenant data center operators are under a constant pres-
sure to expand and/or build new facilities. However, data center
infrastructure is very expensive to build because of its high avail-
ability requirement, costing around US$10 ∼ 25 per watt of IT
critical power delivered (cooling power is separate from IT power)
and taking up more than 1.5 times of the total electricity cost over
its lifespan. In addition, long-time-to-market and local power grid
constraints also pose significant hurdles for increasing capacity in
multi-tenant data centers.
Consequently, to maximize the utilization of expensive data cen-
ter infrastructures, multi-tenant data center operators commonly
oversubscribe the power infrastructure by selling capacity to more
tenants than can be supported. Even owner-operated data cen-
ters, such as Facebook, oversubscribe power infrastructures to
defer/reduce the need of building new capacities. The industry
standard oversubscription ratio is 120%, and recent studies have
begun to suggest even more aggressive oversubscription [3].
Power oversubscription increases capacity utilization and signif-
icantly reduces capital expenses. But, it comes with a dangerous
consequence of overloading the designed capacity (a.k.a., power
emergencies) when the power demand of multiple tenants peaks si-
multaneously. In fact, even short-term overloads over a few minutes
can lead to tripped circuit breakers and costly data center outages
(e.g., Delta Airline’s data center power outage resulted in a US$150
million loss [1]).
Power infrastructure redundancy is very common to ensure a
high availability in today’s data centers. While it can safeguard
the data center against power emergencies by taking over some
overloads, redundancy protection is lost during an emergency. For
example, if with an emergency, a fully-redundant Tier-IV data cen-
ter can experience an outage when either the primary or redundant
infrastructure fails; otherwise, an outage occurs only when both
the primary and redundant infrastructures fail. The loss of infras-
tructure redundancy can significantly increases the outage risk
of a fully redundant Tier-IV data center by 280+ times [2]. Even
though emergencies only occur for 5% of the time, the availability
of a Tier-IV data center can be downgraded to that of a Tier-II data
center, which means a nearly 50% capital loss for the data center
operator.
The severe consequences of power emergencies have led to the
development of various power capping techniques such as CPU
throttling. Nonetheless, the lack of control over tenants’ servers
renders such techniques inapplicable in multi-tenant data centers.
Concretely, a power emergency may still occur, even though all the
tenants are using power within their purchased capacities due to
the operator’s oversubscription decision. Multi-tenant data center
operators, therefore, have taken other precautions by imposing
restrictions on each tenant’ “normal” power usage to be below a
certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of its subscribed capacity, which lim-
its frequent and/or constant usage of a tenant’s full capacity. This
contractual constraint effectively reduces the probability of simul-
taneous peaks of tenants’ power usage, keeping the risk of power
emergencies at a very low level. Hence, despite oversubscription,
power infrastructure in multi-tenant data centers is considered safe.
Contributions. This extended abstract summarizes our recent
work [4]. Our goal is to highlight that, despite the safeguards in
place today, multi-tenant data centers are vulnerable to well-timed
malicious power attacks that can cause a huge financial loss for the
data center operator as well as affected tenants. More specifically,
a malicious tenant (i.e., attacker), which can be the competitor of
the target data center and does not run any useful workloads, can
intentionally increase power to its peak/subscribed capacity in an
attempt to create power emergencies, when it detects an already
high utilization of the shared capacity. Importantly, the total cost
incurred by the attacker, such as server and power capacity costs,
is only small fraction (between 1.44% and 15.88%, as shown by [4])
of the total financial loss borne by the operator and benign tenants.
To illustrate this point, we show in Fig. 1 a 24-hour power trace
by four representative tenants. These tenants run web and data

analysis workloads. The total capacity is 200kW and sold as 240kW
following industry standard oversubscription of 120%. The attacker
subscribes to 30kW and increases its power to full capacity for 10
minutes whenever the aggregate power approaches the capacity
limit. Consequently, we see multiple power emergencies, while the
attacker only occasionally peaks its power and meets its contractual
constraint.
While power attacks are dangerous, attack opportunities only
exist intermittently due to the fluctuation of benign tenants’ aggre-
gate power usage, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Thus, a key question is:
how does the attacker detect an attack opportunity?
Keeping a constant high power will capture all attack opportuni-
ties, but it is not allowed by operator and can lead to the attacker’s
eviction. Because of intermittency of attack opportunities, ran-
domly attacking is not likely to be successful either. Further, even
though some coarse windows of attack opportunities (e.g., possibly
peak traffic hours) can be identified and help the attacker locate
the attack opportunities within a smaller time frame, the actual
attack opportunity is short-duration and may not last throughout
the entire coarse window. Thus, the attacker needs to precisely time
its attacks to coincide with other benign tenants’ high power usage.
Nonetheless, this may seem impossible, as the attacker does not
have access to the operator’s power meters to monitor the benign
tenants’ power usage at runtime.
We observe that the physical co-location of the attacker and
benign tenants in shared data center spaces results in a prominent
thermal side channel which carries benign tenants’ power usage
information. Concretely, almost all the power consumed by a sever
is converted into heat, and due to the lack of complete heat contain-
ment in many data centers (see Fig. 3), some of the hot air can travel
to other servers (a.k.a. heat recirculation) and increases their inlet
temperatures. Thus, an attacker can easily conceal temperature
sensors in its servers to monitor the inlet temperatures, extracting
information of benign tenants’ runtime power usage.
A naive strategy for the attacker is to look at server inlet tem-
perature and launch power attacks whenever the inlet temperature
is sufficiently high. But, even with the same power consumption,
a server closer to the attacker can cause a greater temperature
increase at the attacker’s server inlet than a server that is farther
away. Hence, a high temperature reading at the attacker’s inlet does
not necessarily indicate a high aggregate power consumption of
benign tenants.
We demonstrate that, by leveraging the knowledge of the layout
of the target data center (through a maintenance visit of its own
servers) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the attacker can
obtain a rough idea of the heat recirculation process and use a state-
augmented Kalman filter to extract the hidden information about
benign tenants’ power usage contained in the thermal side chan-
nel. Although the attacker’s CFD analysis only provides limited
and imprecise knowledge of the actual heat recirculation process,
our experiments show that the thermal side channel can assist the
attacker with successfully capturing 54% of all the attack oppor-
tunities with a precision rate of 53%, significantly threatening the
data center availability.
It is also important to note that there might also exist other side
channels. For example, a high response time of benign tenants’
services may indicate a high server utilization and power usage,
but response time is also affected by multiple factors irrelevant of
power and many tenants do not even have any user-facing services
for the attacker to exploit. Further, a data center has a complex
internal wiring topology (e.g., “wrapped” for N+1 redundancy) that
is unknown to the attacker, and hence inferring benign tenants’
power usage from the shared data center power distribution system
can be challenging. In any case, we make the first effort to exploit a
side channel — thermal side channel, which can complement other
side channels (if any) and assist the attacker in timing its attack
more accurately.
In conclusion, the key novelty of our work is that it is the first
study to consider an adversarial setting in multi-tenant data centers—
well-timed power attacks by exploiting a thermal side channel.
There are a small but quickly expanding set of papers [5, 7] that
attempt to create malicious virtual machines to overload the power
capacity in an owner-operated data center. In sharp contrast, our
work exploits a unique co-residency thermal side channel to launch
well-timed power attacks in a multi-tenant data center where an
attacker controls physical servers and can easily inject a high power
load to create severe power emergencies.
2 EXPLOITING A THERMAL SIDE CHANNEL
In this section, we exploit a thermal side channel to guide the
attacker to time its attacks against the shared power infrastructure,
significantly compromising the data center availability.
2.1 Threat Model
We consider that an attacker shares the power infrastructure capac-
ity C with other benign tenants. The attacker can increase its power
to its maximum subscription capacity by running CPU-intensive
workloads. We consider an attack successful if pa + pb > C for
at least L minutes, where pa and pb are the attacker’s and benign
tenants’ power. In our evaluation, we use L = 5 minutes, which
is sufficient to trip a circuit breaker. The attacker can be a com-
petitor of the target multi-tenant data center and wants to cause
a million-dollar loss due to compromised data center availability
by spending only a small fraction in its capacity subscription and
server costs. Note that we do not consider hiding advanced weapons
or physically tampering with the power infrastructures for attacks.
2.2 A Thermal Side Channel
We observe a thermal side channel due to heat recirculation in multi-
tenant data centers. As illustrated in Fig. 2, inside a typical server
room with the raised-floor design, cold air goes into servers through
their inlets, absorbs the server heat, and then returns through hot
isles to the computer room air handler (CRAH) to be cooled again.

Figure 2: Cooling system overview.
Figure 3: Adoption of heat containment [6].
While hot/cold aisle containment can be utilized to guide the airflow
and restrict mixing of hot and cold air, it requires homogeneous
rack configuration, which is not applicable for many multi-tenant
data centers. In addition, heat containment can introduce fire haz-
ards/risks, which many tenants are not willing to undertake. As a
result, an open-flow cooling system is widely used in multi-tenant
data centers. In fact, according to a survey done by Uptime Institute
on 1000+ data centers [6] and shown in Fig. 3, almost 80% of the
data centers have at least 25% of their racks without any heat con-
tainment and 20% of the data centers have no heat containment at
all. Without heat containment, some hot air can travel a few meters
to other servers and increases their inlet temperatures, constituting
a thermal side channel that conveys some (noisy) information of
benign tenants’ power usage to the attacker.
2.3 Estimating Benign Tenants’ Power
Because of the non-uniform impact of different server racks, a high
server inlet temperature does not mean that the benign tenants’
power usage is also high. Thus, a model for the heat recirculation
process is crucial to extract the benign tenants’ power usage.
As the attacker does not know all the details of the data center,
having a detailed server-level heat recirculation model is nearly
impossible. Thus, we create a zone-based linear heat-recirculation
model for the attacker based on the widely-used CFD analysis, by
considering all servers in a zone have a uniform impact on the
attacker’s sensors. This zonal consideration significantly reduces
the complexity of modeling heat recirculation, but naturally comes
at the cost of inaccuracy. Nonetheless, the zone-based model suffices
to detect attack opportunities.
Based on a zone-level model, we develop a Kalman filter to
estimate benign tenants’ runtime power usage, which is hidden in
the thermal side channel. Although the attacker’s zone-level model
only provides a limited view of heat recirculation and can deviate
from the actual process, our experiments show that the attacker
can still estimate the benign tenants’ aggregate power with a high
accuracy (e.g., only 3% error on average). This is partly because the
attacker only needs to track the benign tenants’ power variations
and know the aggregate value.

and precision rates.
2.4 Attack Strategy
To launch its attacks, the attacker sets a triggering threshold on its
estimate of aggregate power. The attacker waits for Twait minutes
to see if the estimate remains high to avoid attacking during a
transient power spike. When the estimate surpluses the triggering
threshold for Twait , the attacker starts attacks and keeps its power
high for a predetermined time of Tattack minutes. In addition,
to comply with the contract, the attacker does not re-attack by
cooling down for at least Thold minutes, even though it may detect
a consecutive attack opportunity.
2.5 Experimental Evaluation
We conduct a CFD analysis to simulate heat recirculation processes
in a multi-tenant data center and show the summary of of power
attacks in Fig. 4(a). We set Tattack = 10, Twait = 1 and Thold = 10
minutes in our evaluation. With a lower triggering threshold, the
attacker will attack more frequently, detecting more attack oppor-
tunities and meanwhile launching more unsuccessful attacks. Thus,
as shown in Fig. 4(b), this results in a higher true positive rate (per-
centage of attack opportunities captured), but a lower precision rate
(percentage of successful attacks among all the launched attacks).
To keep power attacks under 10% of the total time, the attacker can
set its triggering threshold at 101%, resulting in a true positive rate
of 54% and a precision rate of 53%.
We only include our key findings in this extended abstract, while
details on CFD, Kalman filter, and other results are available in [4].
