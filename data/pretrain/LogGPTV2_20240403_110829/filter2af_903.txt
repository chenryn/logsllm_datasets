Most penetration testers know the pain of trying to view and modify an
unparsed JSON string. For those that don't, here's a taste:
    {"userId":1234,"username":"JakeReynolds","favorites":["Rubik's cubes","Doctor Who"],"dislikes":["Sushi","Vegetables"]}
When looking at thousands of these strings a day it is important for them to
be well formatted and easily understandable. There currently exists a Burp
Extension for beautifying JSON but it is written in Python, which requires
Jython to be downloaded and added to Burp. There were also some issues with
Jython and that extension not being as dependable as hoped. Due to those
reasons we ported that functionality to Java which is run natively by Burp.
Java makes this extension one-click install, with support from Google's [GSON
parser](https://github.com/google/gson). The source code can be found on our[
Github](https://github.com/NetSPI/JSONBeautifier) as well as PortSwigger's
[Github](https://github.com/PortSwigger/json-beautifier) which includes
updated build instructions.
To install, simply go to Burp > Extender > BApp Store and select "JSON
Beautifier". The next time there is a JSON request in any of the Burp tabs
there will be the option of "JSON Beautifier". Any content modified in this
tab will also be modified in the "Raw" tab. An example is below:
Thanks for checking out our Burp Extension! If you would like any features
