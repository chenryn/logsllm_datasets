The easiest way to access the data that Shodan gathers is through the web interfaces. Almost all of
themletyouenterasearchquery,soletsdiscussthatfirst:
Search Query Explained
By default, the search query only looks at the main banner text and doesn’t search the meta-data.
For example, if you’re searching for “Google” then the results will only include results where the
text“Google”wasshowninthebanner;itwouldn’tnecessarilyreturnresultsforGoogle’snetwork
range.
Shodansearchfor“Google”
As seen above, a search for “Google” returns a lot of Google Search Appliances that organizations
havepurchasedandconnectedtotheInternet;itdoesn’treturnGoogle’sservers.
Shodan will try to find results matchingall search terms, which means that implicitly there is a+
or AND between each search term. For example, the search queries “apache + 1.3” is equivalent to
“apache1.3”.

Introducing Filters
FiltersarespecialkeywordsthatShodanusestoletyounarrowsearchresultsbasedonthemeta-data
ofaserviceordevice.Theformatforenteringfiltersis:
filtername:value
Important:Thereisnospacebetweenthecolon“:”andthevalue.
To use a value that contains a space with a filter you have to wrap the value in double quotes. For
example,tofindalldevicesontheInternetthatarelocatedinSanDiegoyouwouldsearchfor:
city:"San Diego"
A few filters let you specify several values that are separated by a comma “,”. For example, to find
devicesthatarerunningTelnetonports23and1023:
port:23,1023
Ifafilterdoesn’tallowcommasinitsvalue(ex.port,hostname,net)thenitletsyouprovidemultiple
values.
Filters can also be used to exclude results by prepending a minus sign “-“ to the filter. For example,
thefollowingwouldreturnalldevicesthataren’tlocatedinSanDiego:
-city:"San Diego"
There are many situations where excluding is easier than including. For example, the following
search query uses hash:0 to provide results for services on port 8080 where the main text banner
isn’tempty:
port:8080 -hash:0
Every banner on Shodan has a numeric hash property calculated; for empty banners that value is
zero.Ifyou’retryingtofinddevicesthathaveashort,staticbannerthenthehashfiltermayprovide

Download Data
AftercompletingasearchtherewillbeabuttonatthetopcalledDownloadData.Clickingonthat
button will provide you with the option of downloading the search results in JSON, CSV or XML
formats.
The JSON format generates a file where each line contains the full banner and all accompanying
meta-data that Shodan gathers. This is the preferred format as it saves all available information.
And the format is compatible with the Shodan command-line client, meaning you can download
datafromtheShodanwebsitethenprocessitfurtherusingtheterminal.
The CSV format returns a file containing the IP, port, banner, organization and hostnames for the
banner.Itdoesn’tcontainalltheinformationthatShodangathersduetolimitationsintheCSVfile

When you generate a report you are asking Shodan to take a snapshot of the search results
and provide an aggregate overview. Once the report has been generated, it doesn’t change or
automatically update as new data is being collected by Shodan. This also means that you can
generate a report once a month and keep track of changes over time by comparing it to reports

Shared Search Queries
Finding specific devices requires knowledge about the software they run and how they respond to
banner grabs over the Internet. Fortunately, it is possible to leverage the shared knowledge of the
communityusingthesearchdirectoryonShodan.Peopleareabletoreadilydescribe,tagandshare

Warning: Shared search queries are publicly viewable. Do not share queries that are

Example: Finding Non-Default Services
A common reaction I get when talking about devices exposed on the Internet is something like the
following:

These numbers don’t look that random to me… Right away you should realize that your random
choice of non-standard port might not be so unique. Port 2222 is popular the same way that HTTP
on port 8080 is popular, and it’s also the default port for the Kippo honeypot though I doubt that
many people are running honeypots. The next most popular port is 5000, which didn’t follow the

time that I realized that Australia was the 2nd most popular country to run OpenSSH on a non-
standard port. I decided to take a closer look at Australia, and it turns out that there are nearly the
same amount of servers running OpenSSH on port 5000 as they are on the default port 22. About
68,000 devices are running on the default port, and 54,000 on port 5000. Looking at a few banners
