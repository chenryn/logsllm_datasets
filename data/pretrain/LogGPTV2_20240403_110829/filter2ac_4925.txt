**ATT&CK ID:** T0813  
**Technique Name:** Denial of Control

Adversaries may employ a denial of control to temporarily prevent operators and engineers from interacting with process controls. This can be achieved by denying access to the control systems, which results in a temporary loss of communication with the control devices or prevents the operator from making necessary adjustments to the process controls. During the period of control loss, the affected process may continue to operate, but not necessarily in the desired state.
