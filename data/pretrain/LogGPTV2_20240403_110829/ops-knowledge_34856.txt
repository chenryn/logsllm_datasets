User: Your team is developing a new mobile app, how to version code and collaborate? Please provide specific tools and processes.
Assistant: Code version management and collaboration are very important in developing a new mobile application. The following are some specific tools and processes for code version management and collaboration: 1. Version control tools: Use Git for code version control. Git is a powerful distributed version control system that can assist team members to share and manage code bases, and track and manage changes made to code. 2. Code submission process: Use the Git Flow process for code submission. The Git Flow process is a process model that uses branches to control versions and divides code into a main branch (master) and a development branch (develop), and other branches can be used during development or repair. Every modification is submitted through the branch, and then through merge or pull request, and then the team leader conducts code review. 3. Task management tools: Use task management tools such as Jira to help team members efficiently manage project requirements and task assignments. Jira provides you with defect tracking, task assignment, code review, and remote deployment to help team members achieve collaborative development. 4. Team collaboration tools: Use collaboration tools such as Slack to help team members communicate and collaborate in real time. Slack is a real-time communication tool that provides functions such as online chat, groups and private messages, which can help team members collaborate more closely, share ideas and solve problems. By using the above tools and processes, team members can better manage and collaborate on code versions, thereby improving the quality, efficiency, and reliability of projects.
