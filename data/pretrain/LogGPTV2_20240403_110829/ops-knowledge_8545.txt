User: I need output different information to different terminal instances instead of print them in same output stream, say std.err or std.out.
for example:
I have 5 kinds of information say A-E need to be displayed on different terminal windows on same desktop, looks like
[terminal 1]  <- for displaying information A
[terminal 2]  <- for displaying information B
[terminal 3]  <- for displaying information C
[terminal 4]  <- for displaying information D
[terminal 5]  <- for displaying information E
I know I can output them into different files, then open terminals read the file in loop,
but what I want is python program can open terminal by program itself and print to them directly when it is needed.
Is it possible?
Thanks!
KC
[edit]
the best solution for this case is using SOCKET as the IPC I think if the resource is not a matter, it will come with best compatible capability - a server client mode.
and the pipe / subprocess will also be the useful solutions under same platform
Assistant: Open a pipe, then fork off a terminal running cat reading from the read end of the pipe, and write into the write end of the pipe.
