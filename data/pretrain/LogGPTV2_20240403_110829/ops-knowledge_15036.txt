Question: "Consider a scenario where a wireless local network is being set up for a company. The network architect is concerned about the security of the wireless communication, specifically the potential for on-path attackers to learn the encryption keys during the handshake process or brute-force the password. What measures should the architect implement to mitigate this vulnerability?"
 "A": "Implementing WPA2-Enterprise which uses a RADIUS server for authentication and can provide protection against such attacks."
 "B": "Upgrading all wireless routers to the latest firmware to prevent on-path attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities."
 "C": "Enabling MAC address filtering to restrict network access to known devices and reduce the risk of unauthorized access."
 "D": "Using stronger WEP encryption to secure the wireless network against on-path attackers."
Answer: A
