### Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Two Vehicles Communicate in the Campus

- **Stationary Vehicles (Figure 2a)**:
  - **Description**: Two vehicles remain stationary at a distance of approximately 140 meters.
  - **Experiment Setup**: The sender broadcasts 10 packets per second, and the receiver records the RSSI values. The experiment is conducted twice, each lasting 10 minutes.
  
- **Moving Vehicles (Figure 2b)**:
  - **Description**: Two vehicles move around the schoolyard at a speed of approximately 10-15 km/h.
  - **Experiment Setup**: Similar to the stationary case, but with the vehicles in motion.

#### Scenario 2: Two Vehicles Communicate in Different Environments

- **Description**: Data is collected from different environments (campus, rural area, urban area) to illustrate the impact of the environment on propagation models.
- **Snapshots**: Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c show the different environments.

#### Scenario 3: Four Vehicles Simulate the Sybil Attack

- **Description**: Four vehicles simulate a Sybil attack, where one malicious node (yellow) generates two fake identities (red) at false locations.
- **Setup**: Three normal nodes (blue) and one malicious node (yellow). Normal nodes 1 and 3 record RSSI time series from the malicious node, the fabricated Sybil nodes, and normal node 2.
- **Configuration**: Normal node 1 and 3 are ahead and behind the malicious node, respectively, while normal node 2 moves side by side with the malicious node.

### Observations

#### Observation 1: Temporal Variation of the Channel in VANETs

- **Channel Quality**: The channel quality changes over time in VANETs.
- **Implications**: A predefined propagation model may lead to significant errors in position estimation or false statistical testing based on incorrect assumptions about the RSSI distribution.

**RSSI Distributions (Figure 5)**:
- **Stationary Vehicles (Figure 5a and 5b)**:
  - **First Period**: Mean = -76.8600 dBm, Standard Deviation = 2.3266 dBm
  - **Second Period**: Mean = -72.5390 dBm, Standard Deviation = 0.7654 dBm
  - **Estimated Distances**:
    - FSPL: 281.5 m (first period), 171.2 m (second period)
    - TRGP: 263.9 m (first period), 205.8 m (second period)
  - **Comparison**: The estimated distances are quite inaccurate compared to the actual distance of 140 meters.

- **Moving Vehicles (Figure 5c)**:
  - **Segments**: Four segments, each 1 minute long, containing 600 RSSI samples.
  - **Distribution**: RSSI values do not follow a normal distribution, especially when the vehicle is moving constantly.

#### Observation 2: Spatial Variation of the Channel in VANETs

- **Channel Conditions**: The channel conditions vary across different areas due to complex reflection, refraction, diffraction, and multi-path effects caused by buildings, trees, and other obstacles.
- **Propagation Model Parameters**: Different parameters are required for different environments, making it challenging for a vehicle to dynamically sense the environment and determine optimal parameters.

**Empirical Dual-Slope Piecewise Linear Model (Equation 1)**:

\[
P_r(d) = 
\begin{cases} 
P(d_0) - 10\gamma_1 \log_{10} \left(\frac{d}{d_0}\right) + X_{\sigma_1}, & d_0 \leq d \leq d_c \\
P(d_0) - 10\gamma_1 \log_{10} \left(\frac{d_c}{d_0}\right) - 10\gamma_2 \log_{10} \left(\frac{d}{d_c}\right) + X_{\sigma_2}, & d > d_c
\end{cases}
\]

- **Parameters**:
  - \( P(d_0) \): Known signal strength at reference distance \( d_0 \).
  - \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \): Path loss exponents.
  - \( d_c \): Critical distance.
  - \( X_{\sigma_1} \) and \( X_{\sigma_2} \): Zero-mean, normally distributed random variables with standard deviations \( \sigma_1 \) and \( \sigma_2 \).

**Fit Parameters (Table IV)**:

| **Parameter** | **Campus**   | **Rural Area** | **Urban Area** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| \( d_0 \)     | 1 m          | 1 m            | 1 m            |
| \( d_c \)     | 218 m        | 182 m          | 102 m          |
| \( \gamma_1 \)| 1.66         | 1.89           | 2.56           |
| \( \gamma_2 \)| 5.53         | 5.86           | 6.34           |
| \( X_{\sigma_1} \) | 2.8 dB | 3.1 dB         | 3.9 dB         |
| \( X_{\sigma_2} \) | 3.2 dB | 3.6 dB         | 5.2 dB         |

- **Environment Impact**: The breakpoint distances (\( d_c \)) are longer in the campus and rural areas due to the dominant Line-Of-Sight (LOS) path. In urban areas, densely distributed obstacles cause severe signal distortion in Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. The signal attenuation in the campus environment is better than in the rural area, likely due to the presence of high and dense wayside trees.
