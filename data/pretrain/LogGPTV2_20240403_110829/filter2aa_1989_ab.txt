# Lync Federation and Security Analysis

## Introduction
This document provides an in-depth analysis of Lync Federation, its types, and the security implications. It also covers the reverse engineering efforts to understand and exploit the Lync client and server infrastructure.

## Lync Federation Types

### Dynamic (SRV Discovery)
- **Description**: Allows anyone to communicate with anyone.
- **Restrictions**: Some restrictions apply, such as traffic throttling and contact list limitations.

### Enhanced/Direct Federation (Whitelist)
- **Description**: For trusted partners.
- **Features**: Provides more control over who can federate with your organization.

### Blacklist
- **Description**: Specifically disallows federation with a certain domain.
- **Purpose**: To prevent unwanted or malicious connections.

## Lync Federation - Security

### Dynamic Federation
- **Weak Point**: If a company employs dynamic federation, their infrastructure is publicly accessible.
- **Exploitation**: This public accessibility can be exploited by attackers.

## Lync - Reverse Engineering

### Objective
To understand the capabilities and vulnerabilities of dynamic federation, we reverse engineered the Lync Client.

### Methodology
- **Registered Domains**: Two domains were registered to federate.
- **Tools Used**: Extensive use of the Lync Server Logging Tool and Lync Client.
- **Documentation**: Official Microsoft documentation was sparse and unclear, making reverse engineering the preferred approach.

### Findings
- **Non-Federated Connections**: Require signing and NTLM authentication, making them more secure.
- **Documentation Issues**: The official documentation was often convoluted and sometimes incorrect.

## Outcome of Reverse Engineering

### Tools Developed
- **LyncSpoof**: Acts as a legitimate Lync client and connects to the Lync Front-End Server using NTLM Authentication and message signing.
- **Federator**: Acts as a legitimate Lync Server and connects to another Lync Server via Federation, requiring a certificate from a public CA.

## Video Demos
- **Lync Client SRV Automatic Sign-In**: Demonstrates the automatic sign-in process using SRV records.
- **SRV Records for Automatic Sign-In**: Queries automatically sent by Lync include `_sipinternaltls._tcp.example.com` and `_sip._tls.example.com`.

## Summary

### Security vs. Usability
- **Balance**: There is a balance between "Discovery vs. Privacy" (or Confidentiality).
- **Ease of Discovery**: The easier it is for a company to be discovered for UCF, the easier it is for business, but also the easier it is to attack.

### Technical Details
- **SIP for Signaling/Control Plane**: Used for signaling and control.
- **RTP for Real-Time Communications**: Used for real-time applications.
- **DNS SRV for Service Lookups**: Allows anyone to look up a target company using DNS.
- **Market Leader**: Microsoft appears to be the market leader in UC Federation.
- **Security Features**: Strong default security with SIP TLS and SRTP, making it difficult to intercept encrypted messaging.

## Decrypting SIP TLS Messages

### Objective
- **Decrypt the SIP TLS Message Flow**: To understand how it works.
- **Fuzzing Engine**: In development.

### How It Works
- **SIP TLS Proxy Tool**:
  - **Client Traffic**: The Lync client points to the SIP TLS Proxy, which decrypts the client traffic as a TLS server.
  - **View Traffic**: The proxy then connects as a TLS client to the real Edge Server, encrypts the traffic, and uses Python TLS modules, sockets, and multi-threading.

### Decrypted SIP TLS Messages
- **Message #1**: Client sends a `NEGOTIATE` message with LZ77-8K compression.
- **Message #2**: Server responds with `200 OK`, supporting compression.
- **Message #3**: Client sends the first `SIP REGISTER` message to the Edge Server.
- **Message #4**: Server responds with `401 Unauthorized` and `WWW-Authenticate` header, specifying supported authentication methods (NTLM, TLS-DSK).
- **Message #5**: Client sends the second `SIP REGISTER` message with `Authorization` header (NTLM).
- **Message #6**: Server responds with `401 Unauthorized` and `WWW-Authenticate` header, containing `gsappi-data` for client NTLM authentication.
- **Message #7**: Client sends the third `SIP REGISTER` message with `Proxy-Authorization` header and data for NTLM.
- **Message #8**: Server responds with `200 OK` and sends the compressed stream of data.

## Open Source UC Federation

### Benefits
- **Inexpensive Communication**: Can be used for inexpensive and out-of-band communication between groups of friends.
- **Multimedia Support**: Supports audio, video, and instant messaging.
- **Cost Savings**: Uses open source software for servers and endpoints.

### Architecture
- **Asterisk Federation**: Servers perform SRV lookups to place calls between users on different federated Asterisk servers.
- **No Long-Distance Charges**: No need for SIP trunks to terminate calls at the PSTN, eliminating long-distance and international charges.

### Our Open Source Federation Project
- **SIP Federation Project**: Servers can appear to be in any part of the world by IP address (Linodes).
- **Fake Companies**: Set up fake companies with SIP servers to call one another using SIP user agents on cell phones and computers.
- **DefCon Groups**: A great way for DefCon groups to stay in touch by federating with each other using SRV records.

### Configuration Files
- **Download**: Available at http://enumerator.sf.net.

## Conclusion

### Ideas for Implementation
- **Asterisk as B2BUA**: Move your Asterisk server to the edge with a public IP address, functioning as a "Poor Man’s SBC" for RTP media anchoring.
- **Host Your Own SIP**: Use DNS SRV for direct peering with other organizations.
- **Cloud Services**: Create new cloud services using DNS SRV for SIP peering, experiment with hosting SIP servers in the cloud, and ensure IP QoS for real-time communications.

### Mobile Carriers and Smartphones
- **SIP and Federation**: Slow adoption due to lack of data-only plans.
- **Data-Only Plans**: Would incentivize VoIP usage on smartphones.

### Future Directions
- **WebRTC**: Could disrupt the current landscape with real-time communications natively in the browser.
- **Metcalfe’s Law**: The more people using SIP DNS SRV peering and UC Federation, the more valuable the network becomes.
