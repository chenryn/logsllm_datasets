Lync Front-End Server
Lync Federation - Types 
Dynamic (SRV Discovery) 
Allows anyone to communicate with anyone 
Some restrictions apply (traffic throttling, contact 
lists) 
Enhanced/Direct Federation (Whitelist) 
For trusted partners 
Blacklist 
Specifically disallow Federation with a certain 
domain 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Lync Federation - Security 
Dynamic Federation seems like the weak 
point… 
If Dynamic Federation is employed by a 
company, their infrastructure is publicly 
accessible to all 
Knowing this, what can we exploit? 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Lync – Reverse Engineering 
To see what we could do with Dynamic 
Federation, we reverse engineered the Lync 
Client 
Registered two domains to Federate 
Made extensive use of the Lync Server Logging 
Tool and Lync Client 
Official Microsoft documentation sparse and 
unclear – reverse engineering much easier!

Lync – Reverse Engineering 
It wasn’t all fun and games! 
For non-federated connections, messages 
require signing and NTLM authentication 
Convoluted, sometimes incorrect 
documentation! 
Results of this showed that the security is 
much tighter for non-federated connections

Outcome of Reverse Engineering 
LyncSpoof 
Acts as a legitimate Lync client and connects to 
Lync Front-End Server 
Uses NTLM Authentication and message signing 
Federator 
Acts as a legitimate Lync Server and connects to 
another Lync Server via Federation 
Requires a cert from a public CA

Summary 
Security vs. Usability 
Balance between “Discovery vs. Privacy” (or Confidentiality) 
The easier it is for a company to be “discovered” for UCF, the 
easier for business ~ the easier to attack 
Federation Technically speaking 
Using SIP for signaling / control plane 
RTP for apps requiring real-time communications 
DNS SRV for service lookups, so anyone can look up a target 
company using DNS! 
Microsoft appears to be market leader in UC Federation 
Strong default security with SIP TLS and SRTP 
Very difficult to peak into the encrypted messaging used, or 
is it?....

We should actually be able to decrypt 
those messages. 
We like to understand things 
So that’s what we did 
SIP TLS Proxy Tool 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Objective 1:  Decrypt the SIP TLS message flow 
and learn how it works (Complete) 
Objective 2:  Fuzzing engine (In development) 
How it works 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
How it works 
Microsoft Lync client points to SIP TLS Proxy 
Proxy decrypts client traffic as a TLS server 
View traffic 
Proxy connects as TLS client to real Edge 
Server 
Proxy encrypts traffic 
Uses Python TLS module, sockets, multi-
threading  
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #1 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Client sends a 
NEGOTIATE message 
with Compression of 
LZ77-8K 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #2 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Server inspects 
compression header 
field and matches the 
value of LZ77-8K.  Server 
responds with 200 OK, 
will support 
compression. 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #3 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Client sends first SIP 
REGISTER message to 
Edge Server 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #4 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Server responds with 401 Unauthorized and WWW-
Authenticate header, telling client supported 
authentication methods (NTLM, TLS-DSK) 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #5 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Client sends second SIP 
REGISTER message with 
Authorization header 
NTLM 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #6 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Server responds with 401 Unauthorized and WWW-
Authenticate header, containing gsappi-data for client 
NTLM authentication. 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #7 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Client sends third SIP 
REGISTER message with 
Proxy-Authorization 
header and data, for 
NTLM. 
Decrypted SIP TLS Message #8 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Client  Server 
Server responds with 
200 OK.  You can see the 
compressed stream of 
data sent by the server.

Open Source UC Federation  
Can be used for inexpensive and out of band 
communication between groups of friends. 
Can be used for audio, video and instant 
messaging.  
Saves money by using open source software 
for servers and end points.

Asterisk Federation and How it Works 
SRV Lookups 
When a user that is registered to a federated 
Asterisk server calls another user registered to 
another federated server his server simply 
performs an SRV lookup and places the call to the 
other user.  
In this scenario there is no need for SIP trunks to 
terminate calls at the PSTN. 
This means no long distance or international 
charges for phone calls between federated users.

Our Open Source Federation Project 
SIP Federation Project 
Servers can appear to be in any part of the world by IP 
address (Linodes). 
We set up fake companies with SIP servers. 
We can call one another using SIP user agents on our 
cell phones and computers. 
This would be a great way for DefCon groups to stay in 
touch.  
If each group had a server and federated with one 
another using SRV records they could communicate 
very inexpensively.

Conclusion 
One idea 
You could move your Asterisk server from internal network to 
Edge, with a public IP address (No NAT) 
Asterisk could function as a B2BUA - “Poor Man’s SBC” 
• RTP Media Anchoring 
• No NAT or Topology Hiding 
• Proof of Concept for business communication (offers No Security) 
Then host your own SIP for your organization using DNS SRV, 
using your domain 
Peer directly to other organizations using SIP and DNS SRV 
Remote SIP users could register and place calls as a local 
extension 
Keep your carrier SIP Trunk, for access to legacy PSTN 
IP QoS

The “UC Cloud” - UC Federation and SIP 
DNS SRV Peering 
Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent 
Conclusion – Peering in the New “UC 
Federation” Cloud 
Another Idea 
New UC/VoIP Cloud services using DNS SRV for SIP 
peering 
• Create your own new product/service for Cloud hosting 
for SIP DNS SRV peering (Linode.com) 
• Host your SIP server for your company in the cloud and 
experiment with SIP DNS SRV peering for Fun! 
(Linode.com) 
• IP QoS

Mobile Carriers & Smartphones 
SIP and Federation on smartphones 
Very slow adoption 
In the US, it appears subscribers can’t opt for Data 
Only plans on Cellular/3GPP carrier networks 
Less incentive to use VoIP on my smartphone if I 
already have to pay my carrier for Voice 
Data only plans would be a compelling option and 
help build exciting new applications 
IP QoS for RealTime communications on 
Cellular/3GPP networks
