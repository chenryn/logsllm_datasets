### Issue Report

**Electron Version:** ^2.0.5  
**Operating System (Platform and Version):** Debian 4.9.88-1+deb9u1 (2018-05-07)  
**Last Known Working Electron Version:** This is my first time testing Electron.

**Expected Behavior:**
The application should load the initial required Bootstrap files successfully.

**Actual Behavior:**
I am encountering the error "Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined."

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a basic `index.html` file, similar to the quick start examples provided by Electron.
2. Run the application using Electron.
3. Observe the error in the console.

**Additional Information:**
- A workaround for this issue can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32621988/electron-jquery-is-not-defined).
- The left window in the screenshot shows the application running under Electron with the error message. The right window shows the same file loaded directly in Google Chrome, which works without any issues.
