from the existing security proof we can also extract the opening r of [A]1. What is left to argue
is the binding of such commitment. Since the {ak(Z)}k polynomials are not necessarily linearly
independent (see, e.g., [Par15]) the commitment key ck does not guarantee binding. However, we

can show as follows that the scheme satisﬁes weak binding. In a nutshell, this means that it is
computationally infeasible to open [A]1 to two diﬀerent witnesses u and u(cid:48) with RQ(u)(cid:54)= RQ(u(cid:48)).
Notice that from the two diﬀerent valid openings (u,r) and (u(cid:48),r(cid:48)) of [A]1 we can easily rule
out two cases. The ﬁrst case is the one where r (cid:54)= r(cid:48): this can be immediately reduced to ﬁnding
k)ak(Z) is a nonzero
polynomial: this can be reduced to ﬁnding the discrete log τ (which is known as PDL problem
[Lip12]), as τ can be computed by factoring this polynomial. Therefore we are left with the case
k)ak(Z) is the zero polynomial, yet u (cid:54)= u(cid:48). We argue that it cannot be that
RQ(u) (cid:54)= RQ(u(cid:48)). Indeed, the existing proof [Gro16][Theorem 1] shows that equalities A = α + rδ +
k=0 are the same coeﬃcients
in C. Therefore, if the commitment A opens to u(cid:48) then
k, but in this case the QAP would be satisﬁed (i.e., RQ(u(cid:48)) = 1)

it must be the case that Ck = u(cid:48)
contradicting that u(cid:48) is an invalid witness for RQ.
A new cc-SNARK for QAP relations RQ(u, ω). Here we show how we can modify the
zkSNARK of [Gro16] in order to obtain a cc-SNARK for proving the satisﬁability of QAP relations
of the form RQ(u, ω), that is a scheme where there is a binding commitment to a portion, u, of the
witness and where the public input is void.30

In our construction we consider an augmented QAP (in the sense of [BCTV14]), which is a QAP
as in Deﬁnition H.1 with the additional property that the polynomials ak(X) for k = 0 to n are
linearly independent.

30 It is possible to extend this construction to support non-empty public inputs. For simplicity we keep public input
void as our interest is to use this scheme in order to obtain a full ﬂedged CP-SNARK though our compiler of
Section 3.5 together with the CPlink scheme. In such a case, CPlink can take care of showing that a given preﬁx of
u is the public input.

Our new cc-SNARK, called ccGro16, is the scheme obtained by instantiating the generic SNARK
construction of [Gro16] recalled in Figure 20 with the NILP that we describe in Figure 22. To match
the cc-SNARK syntax we let the commitment be the proof element [D]1. Clearly, [D]1 can be seen
as a Pedersen commitment for the key ck = [ η
i=0]1. By the linear
independence of the ai(Z) polynomials the binding of this commitment can be reduced to the PDL
assumption. Correctness and knowledge soundness follow from the proof of the generic construction
in [Gro16], assuming that the construction in Figure 22 is a NILP. We show that this is the case in
the following theorem.

Proof Perfect completeness is easy to verify. For perfect zero-knowledge, we deﬁne the simulator
that samples A, B, D ←$ F at random and then ﬁnds C so that the veriﬁcation test is satisﬁed. This
shows that real and simulated proofs are identically distributed.
For knowledge soundness, let (Π1, Π2) ∈ F3×(m+2d+5) × F1×(d+4) be an aﬃne prover strategy.
First, we deﬁne the extractor as the one that returns as witness component ω the entries of the second

Once deﬁned the extractor, we need to show that the probability that the proof veriﬁes and the
relation RQ(u, ω) does not hold is negligible. This proof is essentially identical to the one used for
(cid:3)
the NILP of [Gro16].
