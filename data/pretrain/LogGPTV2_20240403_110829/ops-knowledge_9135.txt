Assistant: This log chunk is related to the synchronization of data between a software component and a device. At 00:25:17, the software component Step_ExtSDM calculated the total altitude as 0. At 00:26:00, the software component Step_LSC processed the action android.intent.action.TIME_TICK. This action was processed again at 00:27:00 and 00:28:00. At 00:28:25, Step_LSC changed the stand step and Step_SPUtils set the today total detail steps. Step_ExtSDM also calculated the total calories as 0. At 00:28:48, Step_StandReportReceiver received the action android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF. At 00:31:52, Step_LSC processed the action android.intent.action.TIME_TICK again. At 00:32:28, HiH_HiSyncControl started the timer for autoSync, checked the current day, and initialized the data and user privacy switches.
