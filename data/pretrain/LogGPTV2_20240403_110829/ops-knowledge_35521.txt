Question: In a hypothetical scenario, suppose you receive a DNS response with an 'ANSWER: 0' in the header, and the authority section containing 'NS' records, while the additional section has 'A' records. Which of the following steps would you likely need to take next in the DNS lookup process?
"A": "No further action is needed as the IP address of the target domain has been obtained.",
"B": "Query one of the name servers listed in the authority section using the IP addresses provided in the additional section.",
"C": "Report an error because the response should have contained the IP address in the answer section.",
"D": "Wait for the TTL to expire before making another DNS request as the current response is likely outdated."
Answer: B
