User: How to install Apache server and configure virtual host on Linux system?
Assistant: 1. Install the Apache server On a Linux system, you can use a package management tool (such as yum or apt-get) to install the Apache server. For example, on a CentOS system, you can execute the following command to install: ``` sudo yum install httpd ``` 2. Start the Apache server After the installation is complete, start the Apache server: ``` sudo systemctl start httpd.service ``` 3. Configuring virtual hosts Configuring virtual hosts in an Apache server requires editing the Apache configuration file (typically located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf). In that file find the following line: ``` # Virtual hosts #IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf ``` Uncomment and add the following: ``` <VirtualHost *:80> ServerName example.com DocumentRoot /var/ www/example.com ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-error_log CustomLog /var/log/httpd/example.com-access_log common </VirtualHost> ``` Among them, example.com is the domain name of the virtual host, /var/www/example.com is the website root directory of the virtual host, /var/log/httpd/example.com-error_log is the error log file of the virtual host, and /var/log/httpd/example.com-access_log is the virtual The host's access log file. 4. Restart the Apache server After completing the configuration of the virtual host, restart the Apache server: ``` sudo systemctl restart httpd.service ``` 5. Test the virtual host Use a browser to access the domain name of the virtual host (such as http://example .com) to check whether the website is accessible normally.
