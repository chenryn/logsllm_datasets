gation stability on the Internet as a whole, it is desirable
to study certiﬁcate dynamics of a secure system and to
project certiﬁcate management overhead on a per AS
level. We use BGP data collected by the RouteViews
project [29], and retrieved one BGP routing table of the
ﬁrst day of each month from January to August 2004.
Despite likely incompleteness of the RouteViews data
set, it is one of the most complete data repositories pub-
licly available, and has been widely used in the BGP
community.
6.1. Memory Overhead
There are four types of certiﬁcates which require ex-
tra memory space to store for a BGP speaker to support
psBGP. We estimate the memory overhead for each type
and then give an estimate of the total. While a BGP up-
date message may carry extra digitally signed data and
signatures which need to be stored temporarily, they can
be discarded after verﬁcation. Thus, we do not consider
their memory overhead here.
ASNumCerts and SpeakerCerts. We observed in
total 17 8844 ASes as of August 1, 2004. One ASNum-
Cert is required per AS. In the worst case, an AS may
need to store the ASNumCert of every AS on the Inter-
4AS numbers used by IANA itself for experimental purpose are not
counted.
net; in this case, 17 844 ASNumCerts would be stored.
As with S-BGP and soBGP, psBGP makes use of the
X.509v3 certiﬁcate structure which has wide industrial
support. Assuming the average size of a certiﬁcate is
600 bytes [25], 10.479M bytes memory would be re-
quired for storing 17 844 ASNumCerts. The same holds
for SpeakerCerts.
PALs and MultiASCerts. Each AS si issues a PAL,
whose size is primarily determined by the number of
preﬁxes delegated to si, the number of si’s peers, and
the number of preﬁxes delegated to each of s i’s asserted
peers. While some ASes have many peers, and some are
delegated many preﬁxes, many ASes have only a small
number of peers and are delegated a small number of
preﬁxes. On average, each AS has 4.2 peers and is dele-
gated 9.1 preﬁxes. Assuming the average size of a PAL
is 1 024 bytes, 17.844M bytes of memory would be re-
quired to store 17 844 PALs, one for each AS. For Mul-
tiASCerts, a BGP speaker needs to store one certiﬁcate
for each organization which owns multiple ASes. Based
on the data from Aiello et al. [2], there are 385 multi-AS
organizations which in total own 1 259 ASes. On av-
erage, each multi-AS organization owns 3.3 ASes. As-
suming the average size of a MultiASCert is 600 bytes,
0.226M bytes of memory are required for storing all
MultiASCerts.
In summary, a total of 38.028M bytes of memory are
required for storing all certiﬁcates to support psBGP.
However, more efﬁcient certiﬁcate distribution mecha-
nisms (e.g., see [1, 25]) may be used; further discussion
is beyond the scope of the present paper.
6.2. Bandwidth Overhead
Except for a small number of public key certiﬁcates
of trusted CAs which need to be distributed using out-
of-band mechanisms, all other certiﬁcates in psBGP can
be distributed with BGP update messages, which con-
sumes extra network bandwidth. However, such over-
head is not persistent since those certiﬁcites only need
to be distributed periodically or upon changes. We sug-
gest that such overhead is of little signiﬁcance and will
not discuss it here.
The primary bandwidth overhead is introduced by
digitally signed data and signatures carried by each BGP
update message for protecting the message. For a fully
protected BGP route where every AS on the route dig-
itally signs the update message, the overhead is mainly
determined by the number of such ASes (the average
number is 3.7 according to Kent [25]). psBGP also
makes use of a bit-vector approach [32] to reduce the
number of operations of digital signature generations,
where the size of a bit-vector used by an AS is roughly
equal to the number of peers of that AS. Thus, more
overhead will be added if an AS digitally signing a route
has a large number of peers. To compare with S-BGP
which uses a 16-bit length AS number instead of a bit-
vector, the bandwidth overhead for a given route might
be higher in psBGP if some of the ASes on the route
have more than 16 peers (a corresponding bit-vector will
be larger than 16-bit), and will be lower if all of the
ASes have less than 16 peers. Overall, there might not
be signiﬁcant difference between the bandwidth over-
head of psBGP and S-BGP. As pointed out by Kent [25],
BGP control messages only account for a small fraction
of network bandwidth versus subscriber trafﬁc. Thus,
from our preliminary analysis, we expect that bandwidth
overhead of psBGP will not create difﬁculty in the de-
ployment of psBGP.
6.3. CPU overhead
A BGP speaker supporting psBGP needs to digitally
sign each BGP update message sent to each different
set of peers, and to verify each unique digital signa-
ture carried by each BGP update message it receives
and chooses to use. As shown by Kent et al. [23] in
their study of S-BGP performance, such CPU overhead
is signiﬁcant. While the bit-vector approach adopted
by psBGP might reduce CPU overhead of digital sig-
nature generation to some degree if a BGP speaker usu-
ally sends an update message to multiple peers [32], it
does not reduce overhead of digital signature veriﬁca-
tion. Overall, we expect that signiﬁcant CPU overhead
will be generated by psBGP if an AS chooses to maxi-
mamlly protect BGP update messages. To mitigate the
problem, some approaches might be helpful, such as
caching [23], delay of signature veriﬁcation [23], us-
ing a digital signature algorithm with a faster veriﬁca-
tion operation (e.g., RSA) [32], etc. In addition, since
many BGP speakers currently in use might not be capa-
ble of performing digital signature operations required
to achieve maximum protection of BGP udpate mes-
sages, it might be desirable to provide them a less ex-
pensive option with less protection (e.g., veriﬁcation of
AS PATH plausibility but not integirty).
6.4. Certiﬁcate Dynamics
ASNumCerts and SpeakerCerts.
The monthly
number of ASes has grown by an average of 190 since
January 1, 2004, with an average of 347 ASes added
and 157 ASes removed (see Table 3). When an AS num-
ber is added or removed, the corresponding ASNumCert
must be issued or revoked by an RIR. Thus, four RIRs
between them must issue an average of 347 new AS-
NumCerts and revoke an average of 157 existing AS-
NumCerts per month. This would certainly appear to be
manageable in light of substantially larger PKIs existing
in practice (e.g., see [16]). Note the issuing and revo-
cation of a SpeakerCert is performed by an AS, not an
RIR.
Preﬁx Assertion Lists (PALs). A preﬁx assertion
list PALsi must be changed (removed, added, or up-
dated) if: 1) the AS number si changes (i.e., removed or
added); 2) an IP preﬁx owned by s i changes; 3) si’s peer
relationship changes, i.e., a peer is removed or added; or
4) an IP preﬁx changes which is asserted by s i for one
of its peers. Table 4 depicts the dynamics of preﬁxes,
We study the number of preﬁx assertion (PA) changes
required for each AS based on the two routing tables of
July 1 and August 1, 2004. Each preﬁx addition or re-
moval is counted once (i.e., resulting in one PA addition
or removal) if the AS number of the AS owning that pre-
ﬁx does not change. If an AS number is newly added (or
removed) during the month, all additions (or removals)
