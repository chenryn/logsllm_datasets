propriate mitigation actions. For example, attacker-owned do-
mains could be blocked permanently whereas compromised
ones temporarily. The result shows that this classiﬁer achieves
96.8% accuracy with 99.1% precision and 93.4% recall. We
also design a classiﬁer with high accuracy to classify public
websites as attacker-owned or compromised. In terms of statis-
tics, our results reveal a concerning trend of the malicious
domains observed from VT URL Feed: most of the attacks
are launched from websites whose apexes are not owned by
attackers. Even though public apex domains are less than
1% of the apexes hosting malicious websites, they amount
to a whopping 46.5% malicious web pages seen in VT URL
feed during our study period. Out of the remaining websites
(53.5%), we observe that attackers mostly compromise benign
websites (65.6%) to launch their attacks, whereas only 34.4%
of malicious websites are hosted on domains created by at-
tackers. Understandably, public malicious websites exhibit
the opposite trend where most (79.5%) are attacker owned.
The key insight here is that more has to be done by legitimate
domain owners to prevent miscreants from misusing their
domains to launch stealthy attacks.
