**ATT&CK Technique Name:** WastedLocker

WastedLocker employs an anti-analysis technique that involves checking for the presence of specific registry keys, namely `UCOMIEnumConnections` and `IActiveScriptParseProcedure32`. This detection mechanism is designed to determine whether the malware is being analyzed in a controlled environment, thereby enabling it to evade detection and analysis. [60]
