Question: In what scenario would the `init` process of an Android system load a precompiled SELinux policy instead of compiling the policy files at runtime?
"A": "When the hashes of `/system/etc/selinux/plat_sepolicy_and_mapping.sha256` and `/{partition}/etc/selinux/precompiled_sepolicy.plat_sepolicy_and_mapping.sha256` are different, to ensure the latest policy updates are applied.",
"B": "If `/system_ext/etc/selinux/system_ext_sepolicy_and_mapping.sha256` does not exist, as this indicates that the system_ext partition has no policy changes.",
"C": "When the hashes of policy files on the `system`, `system_ext`, `product`, and the precompiled partition (`vendor` or `odm`) are identical, indicating no policy changes.",
"D": "If `/product/etc/selinux/product_sepolicy_and_mapping.sha256` exists and is different from the precompiled version, which triggers a check for potential policy updates."
Answer: C
