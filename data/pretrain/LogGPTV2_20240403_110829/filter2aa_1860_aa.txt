## Why IPv6? A Quick History

- **1992**: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) began addressing the global shortage of IPv4 addresses and the technical limitations of IPv4.
- **1993**: RFC 1550 was created, outlining the need for a new IP protocol.
- **1995**: The next generation internet protocol (IPv6) was chosen as IPng (IP Next Generation).

## Comparison with IPv4

### Address Space
- **IPv4**: 32-bit address space, providing approximately 4.3 billion possible addresses.
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address space, offering 3.4 * 10^38 (or 340 undecillion) addresses, which is equivalent to 64 billion IPs for every square centimeter on Earth.

### Evolution and Improvements
- **IPv4**: Developed over 20 years ago, with many "band-aids" applied to address evolving needs.
- **IPv6**: Integrates numerous network improvements made over the years, providing a more robust and scalable solution.

### Stateless Autoconfiguration
- **IPv4**: DHCP servers are commonly used but not mandatory.
- **IPv6**: Automatically assigns a Link Local address upon booting (see RFC 2462), similar to getting a 169.xxx.xxx.xxx address in IPv4.

### Security and Quality of Service (QoS)
- **IPv4**: IPSec and QoS are add-ons.
- **IPv6**: Encryption, IPSec, and QoS are built-in, enhancing security and performance.

### Routing Table Growth
- **IPv4**: Backbone routing table size has become a significant headache for ISPs and backbone operators, reaching 113,000 entries by 2003.
- **IPv6**: The maximum number of routes a router will see in the default-free zone is 8,192, significantly reducing complexity.

### Roaming and Mobility
- **IPv6**: Mobile IPv6 and AnyCast make roaming easier and cleaner. For example, a cell phone can automatically identify new routing information from a new tower while keeping the same IP address.

### End-to-End Connectivity
- **IPv6**: Reestablishes end-to-end connectivity, a fundamental design principle of the original internet. NAT, a common fix in IPv4, breaks this connectivity.

## What Do I Need to Know About IPv6?

### 6Bone
- **Experimental IPv6 Beta Network**: IPv6 "islands" connected via IPv4 tunnels.
- **Connectivity**: Native, Tunnel Broker, and other tunneling methods.
- **Growth**: The number of networks continues to grow. For more information, visit [http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk](http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk).

### Global Adoption
- **Early Adopters**:
  - **Asia**: Japan and China expect full conversion by 2005.
  - **European Union**: Actively adopting IPv6.
- **Resistive Adopters**:
  - **United States**: Holds about 70% of the world's IPv4 addresses, with detractors citing the excessive effort required for implementation.
- **New Developments**:
  - **US DoD**: Mandated that all new network infrastructure equipment be IPv6 capable as of October 2003, with full conversion expected by 2008.
  - **Other Initiatives**: NTT/Verio, SpeakEasy, Hurricane Electric, and the Moonv6 Project ([http://www.moonv6.org](http://www.moonv6.org)).

## IPv6 Addressing

### Address Format
- **Example**: `3ffe:80ee:16f9:3481:efab:1092:aaaa:3ff1`
- **Structure**: Each block represents 16 bits.
- **Coverage**: Just two words of an IPv6 address cover the entire IPv4 internet.
- **Address Types**:
  - **3ffe**: 6Bone address (experimental globally routable IP, now deprecated in favor of 2001:: addresses, RFC 3701).
  - **fe80**: Link Local address, used for local network information.
  - **::1**: Localhost (equivalent to 127.0.0.1 in IPv4).
  - **::**: Equivalent to 0.0.0.0.

### EUI-64
- **Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64)**: Clients can receive an IPv6 address based on their MAC address.
- **Prefix Assignment**: 64-bit prefix assigned by Router Advertiser or DHCPv6, with the last 64 bits assigned by EUI-64.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Using MAC addresses as part of the IP is considered a privacy issue. RFC 3041 describes a randomly-generated interface identifier that changes over time to provide anonymity.

### Special Addresses
- **2001**: Production globally routable IPv6 networks.
- **2002**: Used for automatic 6to4 tunneling.
- **FEC0**: Site Local Address (deprecated, replaced by FC00::/7).
- **FF01, FF02, FF05**: Multicast addresses.

## OS Support

### Supported Operating Systems
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Apple OSX, BSDi**: Include the Kame IPv6 stack, enabled by default. Visit [http://www.kame.net](http://www.kame.net).
- **Linux Kernel 2.4.xx**: Buggy IPv6 implementation, can be improved with USAGI project patches. Visit [http://www.linux-ipv6.org](http://www.linux-ipv6.org).
- **Linux Kernel 2.6.xx**: USAGI patches included by default.
- **Solaris 8.x and above**: Native support.
- **Novell Netware 6.x and above**: Native support (load BSDSOCK.NLM).

### Windows Support
- **Windows 9x/Me**: No Microsoft-supported IPv6 capability.
- **Windows NT 4**: Very early beta IPv6 stack.
- **Windows 2000**: Beta quality IPv6 stack.
- **Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server**: Built-in IPv6 stacks, enabled via command line (`ipv6 install`) or network properties. Use `netsh` for CLI control.

## Tunnel Brokers

### Top North American IPv6 Providers

- **NTT/Verio**: Offers tunnelling services to customers in urban and rural areas.
- **Hurricane Electric and Freenet6**: Open tunneling servers, accessible to anyone with an IPv4 address.
  - **Static v4 IP**: [http://www.tunnelbroker.net](http://www.tunnelbroker.net)
  - **Dynamic v4 IP**: [http://www.freenet6.net](http://www.freenet6.net)

### Tunnelling & Transition Methods

#### ISATAP
- **Usage**: Primarily for IPv6 connectivity between hosts on a LAN, VLAN, or WAN.
- **Requirements**: 6to4 gateway for packets to leave the local LAN.
- **Features**: Can be used for IPv6 NAT, with IPv6 addresses including IPv4 addresses (e.g., `2002:836B:1:5:0:5EFE:10.40.1.29`).

#### 6to4 Via a Tunnel Broker
- **Popularity**: Currently the most popular method.
- **Protocol**: Requires IP Protocol Type 41.
- **NAT Compatibility**: Works with 1-to-1 NAT, but not with standard NAT'ed IPv4 hosts.
- **Subnet Allocation**: Most tunnel brokers provide a /48 or /64 subnet.
- **Security**: Often used as an attack vector due to easy setup and potential for international tunneling. Visit [http://www.sixxs.net](http://www.sixxs.net) for a 6to4 proxy.

#### 6to4 Via Auto Tunnelling
- **Setup**: Convert your IPv4 address to hex and prepend `2002` (e.g., `69.3.46.44` becomes `2002:4503:2e2c::/48`).
- **Routing**: Set the default route for IPv6 traffic to `192.88.99.1`.
- **Security**: Questionable, as you have little control over traffic routing.
- **Default Behavior**: Windows XP SP1 auto-tunnels by default, but it is not included in OpenBSD.

#### Teredo
- **Description**: Tunnels IPv6 over UDP, designed for use behind NAT.
- **Details**: Not covered in this primer, but important for enabling IPv6 connectivity in challenging network environments.

This primer provides a comprehensive overview of IPv6, its history, benefits, and practical implementation details.
