their fit for censorship measurement data. Specifically, we test em-
ploying speed constraints (such as the Median Average Deviation
(MAD) [97]), likelihood models [120], exponentially weighted mov-
ing average models [24], and bitmap-based models [109] for anom-
aly detection. We find that the bitmap-based detection technique
works best for our data, and we provide a comparative evaluation
with other techniques in Appendix A.1.
We follow the procedure in Wei et al. [109] and the implementa-
tion by [59] to construct a Bitmap-like representation of our data
after discretizing it [58]. The distance between two Bitmaps BA
and BB of size 𝑛 × 𝑛 is then given by:
𝑛
Dist(BA, BB) =
((BA𝑝,𝑞 − BB𝑝,𝑞)2)
(8)
𝑛
𝑛
𝑝=1
𝑞=1
We use an alphabet size of 4, and a lead and lag window size of 2 %
of the length of the time series for calculating the distance between
two Bitmaps sliding along the time series. The distance acts as the
anomaly score. We explore the events with the highest anomaly
score in our findings (§7).
5.3.3 Trend Detection. Our trend analysis provides insights on the
methods and contents that are increasingly represented in censor-
ship. For the trend evaluation of Censored Planet results, we use
the modified Mann-Kendall test [48, 50] that identifies linear trends
while being robust to gaps and length differences of time series.
The Mann-Kendall test uses hypothesis testing to find upward
or downward (or either) trends (99 % significance level). Since it is
important to consider the absolute change for trend analysis (to
avoid effects due to changing vantage points), we use Equation 7 to
construct the time series for trend detection. To obtain an estimate
of the magnitude of the trend, we use the Thiel-Sen regression
estimator [94] to calculate the slope of the trend line from the start
of our measurements until the end.
6 EVALUATION
We first evaluate the scale, coverage, and continuity of Censored
Planet, highlighting the advantages Censored Planet offers over
existing state of the art censorship measurement platforms. Then,
we show why scale is important especially for obtaining a repre-
sentative measure of censorship within a country.

we apply a Nelder-Mead optimization that uses an error function
to derive the best fitting weight factor:

More precisely, we use the root-mean-square error as the error func-
tion that measures the delta between an individual result and the
target value and try to minimize this error by finding a weighting
factor 𝜔 𝑗 that levels out the differences.
As an output of this step, we receive the weighting factor 𝜔 𝑗
that is specific for each AS𝑗 in the data set. We apply this weight
to all vantage points inside that AS, i.e., for each vantage point vp𝑗
belonging to AS𝑗 and associated weight 𝜔 𝑗, we modify Equation 2

We observed that the smoothing process removes effects that
are caused by only a handful of vantage points while preserving
the effects of a widespread censorship increase. Figure 2 shows an
example of raw (Equation 2) and smoothed (Equation 5) censor-
ship metrics for Discard censorship in Pakistan, where censorship
methods are heterogeneous [71]. We observe that widespread cen-
sorship increases (such as that in November 2018) are preserved
while those caused by rogue vantage points (such as September
2018 and March 2019) are smoothed out. We provide further evalu-
ation of the smoothed censorship metric in Appendix A.2 and use
it to report all country-level results in our findings (§7).
5.3 Time Series Analysis
Continuously collecting and analyzing censorship data is a big chal-
lenge that has not been explored in previous remote measurement
work [77, 78, 106]. Censored Planet’s longitudinal data collection
allows us to develop methods to automatically detect events and
trends in 20 months of longitudinal measurements.
5.3.1 Change in Censorship. As a first step in the time series anal-
ysis, we analyze the change in censorship over time. We consider
changes at the lowest granularity (vp) to avoid the effects of adding

indicate the number of /24 subnets in which we do not discover
vantage points from the previous scan.
6.1 Evaluation of Scale, Coverage & Continuity
Censored Planet achieves global coverage with more than 95,000
vantage points performing weekly scans (cf. Figure 3). Across the
different measurement techniques, we use 50,000 to 60,000 vantage
points for Quack, and an initial set of 10,000 PeeringDB web servers
for Hyperquack, which we later extend to 25,000 web servers with
EV certificates. For Satellite, we use 15,000 to 35,000 resolvers se-
lected under ethical constraints, and time and resource limitations
force us to use only 500 to 1,000 vantage points for Augur.
Continuity in measurement data is important for Censored Planet
to establish a baseline that is comparable over time. To estimate
the continuity of our measurements, we analyze the range of /24
subnets in which we were not able to discover the vantage points
from the previous week of scans. Overall, we find a continuity of
93 %, which means we are able to select vantage points in the same
network with significantly high probability. The slightly smaller
continuity of 89 % in Quack data is caused by the variance in ZMap
scans [36]. We measure the /24 continuity between two different
scans since measuring the continuity at the vantage point level can
be biased by DHCP policies. At the other end, the AS continuity
between scans is extremely high (99.01 %). The high continuity as-
sures that our time series analysis can reliably detect changes in
censorship, and allow us to analyze trends over time accurately.
One of the primary contributions of Censored Planet is the wide-
spread coverage of vantage points and ASes in different countries.
On average, more than 80 % of countries have more than one van-
tage point in each measurement technique, and around 50 % of
countries have more than ten vantage points. In March 2020, Cen-
sored Planet selected a median of 39 vantage points per country
and a maximum of 29,072 vantage points (in China) with a 75th
percentile value of 305. There is a long tail with countries with
many Internet-connected devices such as China, South Korea and
the United States having several thousands of vantage points. Con-
sidering the number of ASes per country with at least one vantage
point selected, the median value is 8, the 75th percentile value is 33
and the maximum value is 1,427 (in the United States).

2018 and OONI (web connectivity) and Censored Planet data is
from March 2020. Outliers have been removed for comparison.
6.2 Complementing other Platforms
Censored Planet extends the global coverage, continuity, and scale
of censorship events, but it is also highly complementary to es-
tablished censorship measurement platforms such as ICLab and
OONI. For instance, Censored Planet can detect a new instance
or pattern of censorship using its diverse and extensive coverage.
OONI data can then be used for on-the-ground confirmation as it
contains precise measurements from end-users. ICLab’s ability to
run flexible, powerful probes such as performing traceroutes can
be used to determine technical details subject to the existence of
a VPN vantage point. This flexibility and power of running client
software is out of reach for remote measurements.
To emphasize the relevance of Censored Planet’s key unique
features, we compare our data set characteristics with ICLab’s pub-
licly available dataset and OONI’s web connectivity dataset, both
of which meet the current state of the art and are comparable to
Censored Planet’s dataset (cf. Figure 4, HQ: Hyperquack, CP: Cen-
sored Planet). To create comparability, we pick data for a full month
(ICLab: 09/2018 [51], latest available data; OONI (web connectivity
test data): 03/2020 [104]; Censored Planet: 03/2020). CP Potential
shows the availability of vantage points and ASes that could be
selected without resource constraints.
Countries. In comparison to ICLab (41) and OONI (156), Cen-
sored Planet covers 221 countries in 03/2020, which gives us the
ability to measure censorship in countries other platforms cannot
reach due to lack of volunteers or ethical risks. Considering the
Freedom on the Net Report 2019 [46], Censored Planet and OONI
cover data from all 21 countries considered “Not Free”, whereas
ICLab can only reach four countries in this critical category.
AS Coverage. Censored Planet achieves a median coverage
of eight ASes per country, where OONI has four, and ICLab has
one AS per country. In the month of comparison, OONI gathered
measurements from 1,915 ASes while Censored Planet achieved an
overall coverage of 9,014 ASes. The total number of ASes covered
by Censored Planet can potentially go up to 13,569.
Continuity. The varying granularity of data collection among
different platforms makes it difficult to directly compare continuity.

Only the interquartile range is considered for best comparison.
We report an estimate of the continuity of measurements by aggre-
gating OONI and ICLab’s data to a weekly granularity to match
Censored Planet. In our measurements, we have a median AS con-
tinuity of 96 % for the comparison month. In this period, ICLab
achieves only 64 % continuity in ASes, which might be caused by
a large number of reported outages through VPN configuration
changes [7]. Since OONI is dependent on volunteers running mea-
surements, OONI data has an even lower AS continuity of 36 %.
This emphasizes the need for a continuous measurement system
like Censored Planet that collects repetitive measurements, since
volunteer-based data collection may be extremely sporadic.
So far, our results demonstrate that the strengths provided by
Censored Planet’s high coverage and continuity complements the
powerful detection capabilities of ICLab and OONI. In the next step,
we further emphasize the importance of large-scale measurements
to accurately represent censorship in a country.
6.3 The Importance of Scale and Coverage
Censorship policies not only vary between countries, but can also
introduce differences within a country [78, 81, 82, 85, 118]. Conse-
quently, it is crucial to achieve sufficient coverage for an accurate
representation of censorship inside a country.
As a measure of variation, we calculate the coefficient of variation
of Cens(Raw) (Equation 2) in the latest scan within countries with
five or more vantage points. Our results (cf. Figure 5) show that
some countries such as Iran and China with centralized censorship
policies apply consistent blocking (lower left) [9, 38]. In contrast,
candidates like Russia and Italy provide heterogeneous results due
to a decentralized implementation of censorship [85]. Especially
in these heterogeneous countries, it is important to use multiple
vantage points and smooth outliers in the results (§5.2).
To underline this conclusion, we randomly sample 1–4 Satellite
vantage points in each country and calculate the relative difference
from the baseline Cens(Raw) (Equation 2). Figure 6 shows that
we can significantly decrease this relative difference by using a
higher number of vantage points, hence, covering more individual
networks within a country.
7 FINDINGS
Using Censored Planet, we gathered more than 20 billion measure-
ments across 95,000 vantage points, covering a period of 20 months,
and measured censorship on six different Internet protocols. Our
data processing pipeline uses robust pre-processing, censorship,
and time series analysis techniques that introduce transparency to
an otherwise extremely opaque field. In this section, we focus on
unexplored censorship phenomena beyond previous studies [7, 104]
to emphasize the value of Censored Planet’s novel capabilities such
as scale and continuous repetitive measurements. We refer to the
Appendix B.3 for a general overview of results.
7.1 Censorship Events
One of the primary contributions of Censored Planet is the ability
to collect and analyze longitudinal baseline measurement data and
automatically detect censorship events using our anomaly detec-
tion technique. To showcase this ability, we first collect a list of
important political, economic, and lifestyle changes that occurred
in different countries during our measurement period from news
media and reports from other platforms such as OONI [104] and Ac-
cessNow [3]. We then use the results from our time series anomaly
detection to uncover new events or extend known events.
Table 1 shows a summary of key censorship events detected by
Censored Planet. The first section of the table has events that have
been reported previously at a limited scale. The second section
contains newly discovered events for which we were able to find a
correlation with a political event. The third section contains key
events detected using our anomaly detection technique (§5.3.2).
Table 1 also includes results from a preliminary investigation into
whether the events found by Censored Planet were present in
OONI’s public web connectivity dataset [104]. We find that most
New events did not cause a censorship increase in OONI data, mostly
due to the low number of measurements (e.g. Cameroon–only 46
successful measurements collected from 2018-11-15 to 2018-12-
15) or volunteers not running measurements continuously (e.g.
Sudan–http://facebook.com was only tested on one day - 2019-04-
08). This shows the value of a platform like Censored Planet that can
run measurements repetitively and scalably to detect censorship
increases. We also investigated ICLab’s published data [51], but the
