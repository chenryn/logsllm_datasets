### 5.3.2 Anomaly Detection for Censorship Measurement Data

We evaluate various techniques for detecting anomalies in censorship measurement data. Specifically, we test the use of speed constraints (such as Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) [97]), likelihood models [120], exponentially weighted moving average models [24], and bitmap-based models [109]. Our findings indicate that the bitmap-based detection technique is the most effective for our data. A comparative evaluation of these techniques is provided in Appendix A.1.

To implement the bitmap-based detection, we follow the procedure outlined by Wei et al. [109] and the implementation by [59]. We first discretize our data [58] to construct a bitmap-like representation. The distance between two bitmaps \( B_A \) and \( B_B \) of size \( n \times n \) is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Dist}(B_A, B_B) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{p=1}^{n} \sum_{q=1}^{n} (B_{A_{p,q}} - B_{B_{p,q}})^2}
\]

We use an alphabet size of 4 and a lead and lag window size of 2% of the time series length to calculate the distance between two bitmaps sliding along the time series. This distance serves as the anomaly score, and we investigate events with the highest anomaly scores in our findings (§7).

### 5.3.3 Trend Detection

Our trend analysis provides insights into the methods and contents that are increasingly censored. For evaluating trends in Censored Planet results, we use the modified Mann-Kendall test [48, 50], which identifies linear trends while being robust to gaps and differences in time series lengths. The Mann-Kendall test uses hypothesis testing to detect upward or downward (or both) trends at a 99% significance level. To consider the absolute change for trend analysis, we use Equation 7 to construct the time series for trend detection. The magnitude of the trend is estimated using the Thiel-Sen regression estimator [94] to calculate the slope of the trend line from the start to the end of our measurements.

### 6. EVALUATION

#### 6.1 Evaluation of Scale, Coverage & Continuity

Censored Planet achieves global coverage with over 95,000 vantage points performing weekly scans (see Figure 3). Across different measurement techniques, we use 50,000 to 60,000 vantage points for Quack, an initial set of 10,000 PeeringDB web servers for Hyperquack (later extended to 25,000 web servers with EV certificates), 15,000 to 35,000 resolvers for Satellite under ethical constraints, and 500 to 1,000 vantage points for Augur due to resource limitations.

Continuity in measurement data is crucial for Censored Planet to establish a baseline that is comparable over time. We estimate continuity by analyzing the range of /24 subnets where we could not discover vantage points from the previous week's scans. Overall, we achieve a 93% continuity, indicating a high probability of selecting vantage points in the same network. The slightly lower 89% continuity in Quack data is due to the variance in ZMap scans [36]. We measure /24 continuity between different scans to avoid bias from DHCP policies. The AS continuity between scans is extremely high (99.01%). This high continuity ensures reliable detection of changes in censorship and accurate trend analysis over time.

Censored Planet's widespread coverage of vantage points and ASes in different countries is a key contribution. On average, more than 80% of countries have more than one vantage point per measurement technique, and around 50% have more than ten vantage points. In March 2020, Censored Planet selected a median of 39 vantage points per country, with a maximum of 29,072 vantage points in China and a 75th percentile value of 305. Countries with many Internet-connected devices, such as China, South Korea, and the United States, have several thousands of vantage points. The median number of ASes per country with at least one vantage point is 8, with a 75th percentile value of 33 and a maximum value of 1,427 in the United States.

#### 6.2 Complementing Other Platforms

Censored Planet extends the global coverage, continuity, and scale of censorship events and complements established platforms like ICLab and OONI. For instance, Censored Planet can detect new instances or patterns of censorship using its diverse and extensive coverage. OONI data can be used for on-the-ground confirmation, as it contains precise measurements from end-users. ICLab’s ability to run flexible, powerful probes, such as traceroutes, can determine technical details, given the existence of a VPN vantage point. This flexibility and power of running client software are beyond the reach of remote measurements.

To highlight Censored Planet’s unique features, we compare our dataset characteristics with ICLab’s publicly available dataset and OONI’s web connectivity dataset (see Figure 4). For comparability, we select data for a full month: ICLab (September 2018 [51]), OONI (March 2020 [104]), and Censored Planet (March 2020). CP Potential shows the availability of vantage points and ASes that could be selected without resource constraints.

- **Countries**: Censored Planet covers 221 countries, compared to ICLab (41) and OONI (156). This allows us to measure censorship in countries other platforms cannot reach due to lack of volunteers or ethical risks. According to the Freedom on the Net Report 2019 [46], Censored Planet and OONI cover all 21 "Not Free" countries, whereas ICLab can only reach four.
- **AS Coverage**: Censored Planet achieves a median coverage of eight ASes per country, compared to OONI (four) and ICLab (one). In the comparison month, OONI gathered measurements from 1,915 ASes, while Censored Planet covered 9,014 ASes, potentially reaching up to 13,569.
- **Continuity**: The varying granularity of data collection among different platforms makes direct comparison challenging. We report an estimate of continuity by aggregating OONI and ICLab’s data to a weekly granularity. Censored Planet has a median AS continuity of 96% for the comparison month, while ICLab achieves only 64% and OONI 36%. This highlights the need for a continuous measurement system like Censored Planet.

#### 6.3 The Importance of Scale and Coverage

Censorship policies vary not only between countries but also within them [78, 81, 82, 85, 118]. Therefore, achieving sufficient coverage is crucial for an accurate representation of censorship within a country.

As a measure of variation, we calculate the coefficient of variation of Cens(Raw) (Equation 2) in the latest scan within countries with five or more vantage points (see Figure 5). Countries like Iran and China, with centralized censorship policies, show consistent blocking (lower left) [9, 38]. In contrast, countries like Russia and Italy provide heterogeneous results due to decentralized censorship implementation [85]. In these heterogeneous countries, using multiple vantage points and smoothing outliers is essential (§5.2).

To emphasize this, we randomly sample 1–4 Satellite vantage points in each country and calculate the relative difference from the baseline Cens(Raw) (Equation 2). Figure 6 shows that using a higher number of vantage points significantly decreases the relative difference, thus covering more individual networks within a country.

### 7. FINDINGS

Using Censored Planet, we gathered over 20 billion measurements across 95,000 vantage points, covering 20 months and measuring censorship on six different Internet protocols. Our data processing pipeline uses robust pre-processing, censorship, and time series analysis techniques, providing transparency in an otherwise opaque field. In this section, we focus on unexplored censorship phenomena beyond previous studies [7, 104] to highlight the value of Censored Planet’s novel capabilities, such as scale and continuous repetitive measurements. A general overview of results is provided in Appendix B.3.

#### 7.1 Censorship Events

One of Censored Planet’s primary contributions is the ability to collect and analyze longitudinal baseline measurement data and automatically detect censorship events using our anomaly detection technique. To demonstrate this, we first compile a list of significant political, economic, and lifestyle changes that occurred in different countries during our measurement period from news media and reports from other platforms like OONI [104] and AccessNow [3]. We then use the results from our time series anomaly detection to uncover new events or extend known events.

Table 1 summarizes key censorship events detected by Censored Planet. The first section includes previously reported events at a limited scale. The second section lists newly discovered events correlated with political events. The third section contains key events detected using our anomaly detection technique (§5.3.2). Table 1 also includes a preliminary investigation into whether the events found by Censored Planet were present in OONI’s public web connectivity dataset [104]. Most new events did not cause a censorship increase in OONI data, primarily due to low measurement numbers or sporadic volunteer participation. This underscores the value of a platform like Censored Planet, which can run measurements repetitively and scalably to detect censorship increases. We also investigated ICLab’s published data [51], but the results were inconclusive.
