tion to those over 18 years old residing in the U.S. Our only other
screening requirement was that they needed to have successfully
completed at least 95% of their previous tasks. We used partic-
ipants’ open-ended descriptions of the found emails as a screen-
ing mechanism to detect cheating. After removing ﬁve participants
who provided gibberish or nonsensical responses to this question,
we were left with 995 legitimate responses. Because this method
could only screen out participants who reported ﬁnding sensitive
information (i.e., those claiming to be unsuccessful did not answer
this question), our results likely represent lower bounds; it is pos-
sible that some participants did not correctly perform the task and
therefore inﬂated the denominator.
We randomly assigned participants to one of nine conditions that
varied based on the data type to be searched. We asked participants
to perform most of the searches using multiple formats that we pro-
vided them. The data types and formats were as follows:
1. Social Security Number (SSN)
Format: “XXX-XX-XXXX” and “XXXXXXXXX”
2. Last 4 digits of the Social Security Number (SSN)
Format: “XXXX”
3. Bank account number
4. Last 4 digits of a bank account number
Format: “XXXX”
5. Credit card number
Format: “XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” and “XXXX-XXXX-
XXXX-XXXX”

We compensated all participants $1, regardless of whether or
not their searches were successful, so as to not incentivize over-
reporting. Based on the clarity of participants’ open-ended de-
scriptions of the emails found, we saw no indication that they over-
reported results. It seems likely that this experiment may underesti-
mate the amount of sensitive information in email archives, because
it is likely that some participants may have felt uncomfortable re-
porting this information to us, despite the fact that our instructions
made clear that we did not want them to share the speciﬁc search
results with us. Thus, this is another reason why we suspect that
our results represent lower bounds on the prevalence of sensitive
information.
To assess whether locking behaviors correlated with the amount
of sensitive data found in an email account, we prefaced the survey
with a question on whether or not participants lock their smart-
phones. We used the same question and options from the Google
Consumer Survey that we discussed earlier (i.e., What secret un-
lock method do you use on your smartphone?). Unfortunately, we
did not think to add this question until after we had already re-
ceived 495 responses, and thus we only collected responses to this
question for the last 500 respondents.
5.1.2 Results
We observed that 343 participants (35% of 995) reported ﬁnding
at least one email containing the requested information (Table 2).
As would be expected, the frequency with which certain data types
were found appeared to vary inversely with the perceived sensitiv-
ity of that data: at the low end, “only” 16% of participants found
their full credit card numbers, whereas 76% reported ﬁnding their
home addresses.
We performed Fisher’s exact test to examine whether partici-
pants with unlocked smartphones were more or less at risk than
those with locked smartphones. We observed a statistically signiﬁ-
cant difference: 38% of those using locks found sensitive informa-
tion in their email accounts, whereas 27% of those not locking their
smartphones found sensitive information (p < 0.010; two-tailed).
While signiﬁcant, the effect size is small (Cramer’s V = 0.123). In
addition to more lock-using participants ﬁnding sensitive informa-
tion, a Mann-Whitney U test indicated they also found signiﬁcantly
more of it (U = 23, 340.5, p < 0.009).
8
Many participants reported being surprised by their ﬁndings. We
performed a Pearson correlation between participants’ self-reported
surprise assessment (reported using a 5-point Likert scale, from ex-
pected many more to expected many fewer) and the number of hits
their searches yielded and found a positive correlation (r = 0.14,
p < 0.0005). Likewise, a Mann-Whitney U test of the surprise
assessments between those who found any hits and those who did
not was also statistically signiﬁcant (U = 98, 735.5, p < 0.001).
Thus, over a third of our participants found sensitive data in
their email accounts, which was surprising to them, and those lock-
ing their smartphones were more likely to ﬁnd sensitive data. Of
course, these results say nothing about causality; we do not know
if participants choose to lock their phones because they know that
more sensitive data can be found in their email accounts (accessi-
ble from their phones), or if participants are more willing to send
sensitive data via email because they lock their phones. It is also
possible that some or all of this effect could be simply due to prim-
ing: participants who acknowledged not locking their phones may
have felt a need to under-report. Regardless of the reason, it is
still disconcerting that of those who do not lock their devices, 19%
found full bank account numbers, 33% found email passwords, and
46% found dates of birth.
This is particularly troubling when considering the authentica-
tion requirements of many smartphone applications that store sen-
sitive data, such as the payment, shopping and banking applications
that many of our interview participants had installed. While these
applications require additional authentication, which participants
cited as a reason for their lack of concern, in many cases the authen-
tication can be circumvented when an attacker has access to email.
Passwords to Groupon, Amazon, and Uber accounts, which protect
a user’s ﬁnancial information and physical address, can be reset via
email. PayPal and eBay require a full credit/debit card number and
the answers to two security questions in order to change a pass-
word: our online survey suggests that an attacker would be able to
locate a credit/debit card number in a victim’s email account around
17% of the time, while Schechter et al. showed that guessing the
answers to security questions is often quite easy [30]. Similarly,
with knowledge of the username (often saved on the applications’
home screens), the passwords for Bank of America and Fidelity can
be reset via email. Without knowing the username, the passwords
for Wells Fargo, Chase and Fidelity can be reset with two of the fol-
lowing four pieces of information: account number (found in 26%
of email accounts),4 birthdate (found in 46% of email accounts),
credit/debit card number (found in 16-17% of email accounts), or
Social Security Number (found in 20% of email accounts).
6. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss how our experiment compares with
related work, ways in which more users could be motivated to lock
their smartphones, whether it is rational to expect all users to lock
their phones, the limitations of our experiments, and we conclude
with future work.
6.1 Comparison with Related Work
As discussed in Section 2, Harbach et al. also performed an ex-
periment to examine users’ motivations for locking (or not locking)
their smartphones [21]. Because our experiments were performed
at different times, using different samples, and used different sur-
vey instruments and interview guides, we cannot make a direct
statistical comparison. However, at a high level, we believe our

experiments are complementary. Harbach et al. performed an in-
depth ﬁeld study on the likelihood of one particular threat model
occurring—shoulder surﬁng. They also noted that “no participant
mentioned protecting login credentials or logged-in accounts di-
rectly.” We expanded upon this by asking participants about the
types of sensitive data that could be found in their email accounts
(Section 5). We observed that indeed this is a serious threat, as
many participants were able to ﬁnd data ranging from passwords to
bank account numbers. Thus, while Harbach et al. observed that
there are situations in which users have sensitive data displayed on
their devices upon which others may eavesdrop, we show that a de-
vice falling into the wrong hands may yield even greater violations
of privacy and other security-related consequences.
Our studies also corroborate each other. For instance, we found
that despite being viewed as a nuisance, many users continue to
lock their devices because they believe that the beneﬁts outweigh
the costs. Harbach et al. observed that 47% of their online partic-
ipants stated that unlocking their phones was annoying, yet con-
tinued to use an locking mechanism, whereas 40% of our lock-
using interview participants also said that it was a nuisance (despite
continuing to use it). Supplementing the answers to this question
with open-ended followup during the in-person interviews helped
to shed additional light on participants’ motivations. For instance,
we observed that almost every participant had some experience
with the theft or loss of a device, either ﬁrst or secondhand. As we
will discuss in the next section, the opportunity to ask open-ended
followup questions during interviews allowed us to propose new
strategies to encourage more people to enable locking mechanisms
on their mobile devices.
Where our studies diverge is with regard to conclusions. Harbach
et al. concluded that because “unlocks are perceived as unneces-
sary in private environments and sensitive data is seldom accessed,
we suggest that more effort should be put into researching how to
decrease the number of unlocks by deploying usable context- and
content-dependent locking mechanisms” [21]. Through our qual-
itative interviews and our online quantitative survey, we observed
that roughly a quarter of our participants chose to lock their devices
in order to regulate when friends and family accessed them. For
these participants, the primary threat model stemmed from these
private environments. Thus, the decision of whether or not a device
should be locked at any given moment is likely to extend beyond
context and the content to be displayed on the device’s screen, but
also needs to consider the user’s personal privacy preferences and
the data stored on—or accessible through—the device.
6.2
Improving Uptake
Assuming that locking one’s smartphone is a “good” security
behavior, how can we motivate more people to do so? Given the
millions of people in the U.S. using smartphones, the 29% of inter-
view participants (and 42% of GCS respondents) not locking their
smartphones represent a large number of users who may be expos-
ing themselves to threats unnecessarily. Based on the GCS data, a
large minority of users do not lock their devices because they do
not believe it is worth the effort (34% of 500). We believe that the
majority can be motivated through simple design changes to mobile
platforms and education.
Our GCS data indicated that 26% of users do not lock their de-
vices because they do not believe that they have any data worth
protecting. Our email experiment rebuts this: 35% of our par-
ticipants were able to ﬁnd sensitive data stored in their email ac-
counts, which an attacker could easily access on an unlocked smart-
phone. None of our interview participants—regardless of locking
behavior—made a connection between the sensitive data that might
be stored in an email account and the ability to access that data
through their smartphone, and therefore it is likely that those claim-
ing to not have any sensitive data stored on their smartphones were
not making this connection either. We believe that some aware-
ness could be achieved by better messaging. For instance, sev-
eral participants indicated that a customer service representative
initially helped them setup their smartphones; during this process,
the representative could point out that any information contained
in their email archives could be viewed by anyone who possesses
their smartphone. Likewise, due to network effects, email providers
have a strong incentive for mobile users to prevent unauthorized ac-
cess to email accounts. The providers could enforce this by using
existing technologies: for instance, Microsoft’s Exchange allows
an administrator to specify a minimum security policy (e.g., using
a PIN of a certain length, a ﬁnite number of failed unlocks, etc.)
with which mobile devices must comply in order to access email.
One in ﬁve of our GCS respondents claimed to not lock their
smartphones simply because the idea had not occurred to them.
These are not users who are opposed to locking. As we observed
during our interviews, several participants locked their devices not
because of speciﬁc concerns, but because they were asked about
it during device setup. These participants continued to lock their
devices long after. This suggests that inertia plays a role in the use
of locking mechanisms: those who use them tend to continue to do
so, even if they cannot cite a speciﬁc reason why, while many who
do not simply do so because they were never asked. Platform de-
signers could likely get more users to lock their devices by simply
asking them if they would like to do so as part of the setup process.
This could work on an opt-out basis (e.g., the setup process could
require them to set it up, but allow them to visit a settings panel to
disable it at a later time), or it could allow them to skip setting it
up, but may ask them again in the future.
Finally, we observed that almost 10% of users do not lock their
devices because they are worried that emergency personnel might
not be able to use their smartphones to notify loved ones. As we
noted earlier, applications exist to address this concern by display-
ing this information on a device’s lock screen. Platform designers
could directly address this concern by building this feature into the
platform, and make it conﬁgurable during device setup, so as to
make its existence clear to users.
6.3 Rational Rejection?
Our email experiment showed that those who did not lock their
phones were able to ﬁnd signiﬁcantly less sensitive information in
their email accounts; only 27% reported locating sensitive informa-
tion, as compared to the 38% who locked their smartphones. We
also observed that 34% of our GCS respondents did not believe that
their devices contained data that would be interesting to others, and
therefore opted to not lock them. We do not know where the union
of these two sets lies: for instance, it is possible that the 34% who
do not believe their devices store sensitive data are entirely correct.
If this is the case, the rejection of locking mechanisms may be a ra-
tional decision for them. For instance, Herley observed that some
security advice that experts give to users is irrational once one com-
pares the value of the resources being protected against the cost of
users’ time to protect it [23]. In this case, it is possible that many
