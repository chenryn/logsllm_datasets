The answer for making a break works, however how the method works for a user
should probably be abstracted away since it is not only unintuitive, but also
quite lengthy for a simple break. I wish to create set_axis_break_x and
set_axis_break_y functions that would take a tuple and create the break
between the 2 data points without need for those long lines of code.
