User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题htaccess redirect querystring value I need to redirect

www.URL.it/directory_one/index.php?param_one=XXX&amp;param_two=**YYY**


to

www.URL.it/newpage.php?param_three=**YYY**


I tried all I found online but the only things that works is redirect directory_one/index.php to newpage.php without parameters.

I tried this .htaccess

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} =www.URL.it/directory_one/index.php? [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(param_one=XXX&amp;param_two=**YYY**)
RewriteRule ^$ http://www.URL.it/newpage.php?%1 [R=301,L]


only to see if somethings happens but not works

I tried also

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /directory_one/index\.php
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} param_one=XXX&amp;param_two=**YYY**
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.URL.it/test/index.php? [L,R=301]


but nothings happened

Assistant: Make sure you have AllowOverride set for the directory .htaccess resides in or Apache will ignore it.

Try this:

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} param_one=XXX
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} param_two=([^&amp;]+)
RewriteRule ^/directory_one/index\.php$ http://www.URL.it/newpage.php?param_three=%1 [L,R]


If param_two really is to be YYY, use this as there is no need to use backreferences:

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} param_one=XXX
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} param_two=YYY
RewriteRule ^/directory_one/index\.php$ http://www.URL.it/newpage.php?param_three=YYY [L,R]


If none of the above work, another rule might take precedence or you may have placed the rules in the wrong spot. You should debug the whole thing with

RewriteLog /path/to/file.log
RewriteLogLevel 3
