**ATT&CK ID:** T1651  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Cloud Administration Command

Adversaries may exploit cloud management services to execute commands within virtual machines or hybrid-joined devices. Cloud platforms such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Azure Automation Runbooks provide users with the capability to remotely run scripts on virtual machines by leveraging installed agents. In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environments, Microsoft Endpoint Manager enables Global Administrators or Intune Administrators to execute scripts with SYSTEM-level privileges on on-premises devices that are joined to Azure AD.

This technique allows attackers to gain unauthorized access and control over cloud resources and on-premises devices, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
