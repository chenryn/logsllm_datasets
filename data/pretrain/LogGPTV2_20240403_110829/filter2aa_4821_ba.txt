In 2016, 38% of Norwegian households were single-person households, compared to 34% twenty-five years earlier.&#91;136&#93; Among cohabiting couples, 28% were unmarried in 2015, an increase from 11% in 1990.&#91;137&#93; For individuals under 30, cohabitation is more common than marriage. In 2016, approximately one-third of new marriages were civil unions. There were around 4,600 registered same-sex marriages or partnerships.

In 2015, 2.8 million people, or 50% of Norway's population, were employed. Women accounted for 47% of this workforce. Among women aged 15 to 74, 68% were in the labor force, while the corresponding figure for men was 74%. Of the working men, 85% were in full-time employment, whereas only 62% of women worked full-time. The average annual salary in 2015 was NOK 520,000, with women's monthly earnings being approximately 86% of men's, when adjusted for full-time employment. This represents a significant improvement from 1960, when women earned only 60% of what men did.&#91;137&#93;

The number of students in 2015 was approximately 1.1 million, representing over 20% of the population. Over 90% of young people aged 16 to 18 were enrolled in secondary education, up from 65% in 1980.

#### Civil Society

In 2016, nearly 1.814 million people were registered members of Norwegian trade unions. The largest organizations are LO, YS, Unio, and Akademikerne, which together represented 93% of all union members, up from 87% in 1999. LO is the largest, with almost half of all organized workers. The overall unionization rate in Norway was 49% in 2016, a slight decline from 49.5% in 2006. Union membership in the public sector stands at about 80%, while in the private sector, it is around 38%.&#91;138&#93; Generally, women, older individuals, and those with higher education are more likely to be unionized.&#91;139&#93;

A 2014 survey on living conditions revealed that nearly 80% of the population were members of one or more organizations, with trade and worker unions being the largest group. However, only 45% reported active participation in their organizations, with sports clubs having the highest engagement among active members. Seven percent of the population are members of political parties.&#91;140&#93;

#### Health

Norway's healthcare system is divided into primary care, managed by each municipality, and specialized care, overseen by four regional health enterprises. The country introduced the family doctor system in 2001, and the health and social services sector employed around 325,000 people in 2016, with about 85% being women.&#91;141&#93; Approximately 70% of the population consults their family doctor annually.&#91;142&#93;

Life expectancy for boys born in 2015 was 80.4 years, and for girls, it was 84.2 years. This marks a significant increase from the period 1946-1950, when life expectancies were 69.3 and 72.7 years, respectively. The infant mortality rate is about 3 per 1,000, resulting in around 200 deaths per year as of 2015.&#91;144&#93;

Cardiovascular diseases accounted for nearly 40% of deaths in the early 2000s, down from the 1970s. By 2014, this had further decreased to 29.6%. Cancer-related deaths have increased, accounting for nearly 30% in the early 2000s and 27.4% in 2014. The proportion of deaths due to dementia has risen from 2.2% in 2000 to 7.6% in 2014, reflecting both a decline in cardiovascular disease mortality and an increase in life expectancy.&#91;145&#93; 

Violent deaths, such as falls, traffic accidents, and suicides, have been declining in recent years. The number of daily smokers in Norway has dropped from 29% in 2002 to 12% in 2016, while the daily use of snus (a type of smokeless tobacco) stood at 10% in 2016.&#91;146&#93; Alcohol consumption has remained relatively stable at 25-26 million liters per year, with a trend towards reduced spirits, increased wine and low-alcohol beer, and steady beer consumption.&#91;147&#93;

#### Crime

In the 2007 living conditions survey, about 5.5% of the population over 16 reported experiencing violence or threats in the past year, and roughly 10% reported theft or vandalism. These levels have remained relatively stable over the past 25 years. About 3.6% of the population were victims of the approximately 400,000 crimes reported to the police, primarily thefts and other property crimes. Homicide rates in Norway have remained below one per 100,000 inhabitants annually, one of the lowest in the world.

The police in Norway handled around 80,000 individuals annually in the first decade of the 2000s, with about 60% receiving fines and nearly 30% being prosecuted in court. Traffic violations are the most common reasons for both fines and imprisonment, although they do not carry the harshest penalties.

Of the approximately 3,400 people in prison in 2009, nearly 30% were incarcerated for drug offenses, followed by property crimes and violent offenses, each accounting for over 20%.

#### Culture

**Henrik Ibsen**
- **Painting:** "Ekko" by Theodor Kittelsen (1888)

**Music**

Norway's folk music tradition was promoted in the 19th century by national music pioneers Ole Bull and Ludvig Mathias Lindeman, making it a significant part of the nation-building process. Internationally renowned classical composers Edvard Grieg and Johan Svendsen were deeply inspired by Norwegian folk music, incorporating folk melodies and rhythms into their works. In popular music, Norway has produced many successful artists, including A-ha, Röyksopp, Kygo, and Alan Walker. The country also has notable jazz musicians like Bugge Wesseltoft and Jan Garbarek, and has contributed to the development of Black Metal, with bands such as Mayhem, Burzum, Dimmu Borgir, and Enslaved.

**Literature and Written Culture**

Norwegian literature dates back to Old Norse poetry and sagas, recorded by Snorri Sturluson in Iceland in the 13th century. The best-known medieval work is "Kongespeilet," a didactic dialogue created for the sons of King Magnus the Lawmender.

During the Danish era, the most famous writers were Petter Dass, known for his hymns and poems, particularly "Nordlands Trompet," and the Danish-Norwegian dramatist Ludvig Holberg, who also wrote the novel "Nils Klim's Journey to the Underworld."

The 19th century saw a flourishing of Norwegian literature. National Romantic poet Henrik Wergeland and the more European-influenced Johan Sebastian Welhaven were two prominent figures representing different traditions. Henrik Ibsen remains one of the world's foremost playwrights and the leading exponent of realism in theater. Other notable authors of the time include Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Alexander Kielland, and Jonas Lie, who, along with Ibsen, were considered the "Four Greats" at the end of the 19th century. Arne Garborg and Amalie Skram were also important writers of this period. Peter Chr. Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe's collections of Norwegian folk tales, first published in the 1840s, reflected the strong oral storytelling tradition and played a significant role in the development of the Norwegian written language and literature.

The first half of the 20th century was dominated by Sigrid Undset and Knut Hamsun, both conservative and politically nostalgic, though they wrote in very different styles. Both won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Post-war literature has been diverse, ranging from the cultural radicalism of Jens Bjørneboe and Agnar Mykle to the left-radical modernism of Dag Solstad and the naivety of Erlend Loe. Jan Kjærstad, Lars Saabye Christensen, and Erik Fosnes Hansen are well-known contemporary fiction writers. Jon Fosse is the most performed Norwegian playwright since Ibsen and was the most performed contemporary playwright in Europe at the beginning of the 2000s.

**Visual Arts**

Norway's folk art tradition includes decorative arts such as rosemaling and woodcarving. The 19th century is often regarded as a golden age of Norwegian visual art, characterized by the romantic ideals of the time. Artists like Adolph Tidemand, Hans Gude, and J.C. Dahl achieved international recognition, often depicting Norwegian landscapes, history, and folk culture. Edvard Munch, known for his expressionist style, is the most internationally renowned Norwegian artist. In modern times, Odd Nerdrum, Håkon Gullvåg, Inger Sitter, and Ørnulf Opdahl are among the most famous painters.

Gustav Vigeland is Norway's most famous sculptor, known for the Vigeland Sculpture Park in Frogner. Post-war sculptors include Arnold Haukeland and Nils Aas.

**Sports**

Football is the most popular sport in Norway, similar to many other European countries. Winter sports, particularly skiing, are also highly popular, and Norwegian athletes have traditionally excelled internationally in these disciplines. Popular winter sports include cross-country skiing, ice skating, ski jumping, biathlon, and alpine events.

The website Greatest Sporting Nation ranks countries based on sporting achievements, both overall and per capita (Per Capita Cup). Norway ranked first in 2010, 2011, and 2017. Much of this success can be attributed to the investments made after the Summer and Winter Olympics in 1984, where Norway's medal haul was modest. The Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports established "Project 88" in 1985 to improve results leading up to the 1988 Summer Olympics, including the creation of Olympiatoppen, which aims to foster collaboration across different sports and provide financial support to athletes.&#91;148&#93;&#91;149&#93;

Notable athletes include Oscar Mathisen, John Arne Riise, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Sonja Henie, Grete Waitz, Bjørn Dæhlie, Ole Einar Bjørndalen, Cato Zahl Pedersen, Petter Northug, Kjetil André Aamodt, Jon Rønningen, Andreas Thorkildsen, Petter Solberg, Johann Olav Koss, Marit Bjørgen, Kari Traa, and recent ski jumpers Sigurd Pettersen and Anders Jacobsen.

**UNESCO World Heritage Sites**

Norway has eight sites listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord are listed together as the West Norwegian Fjords.&#91;150&#93;
