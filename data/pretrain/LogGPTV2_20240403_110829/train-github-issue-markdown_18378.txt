## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
I Would love to see a feature allowing us to set any window to be always on
top of other windows. I thing a good way to enable the feature would just be
add it to the context menu when you right click on the title bar of a window.
## _What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the
scenario this would be used?_  
Enable the feature, the window stays always on top of ALL other windows.
