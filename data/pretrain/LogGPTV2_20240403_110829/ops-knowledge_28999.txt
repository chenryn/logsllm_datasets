Question: Which of the following statements accurately reflect the consequences or mitigation strategies for the vulnerability associated with PRNG seed reuse?
"A": "Reusing a PRNG seed across sessions increases the entropy of the generated numbers, enhancing the security of the application.",
"B": "Utilizing libraries or frameworks that conform to FIPS 140-2 standards can help mitigate issues arising from obvious entropy problems in PRNGs.",
"C": "Re-seeding a PRNG periodically with user-provided input data can prevent attackers from predicting future outputs.",
"D": "Using a small seed space, such as sequential user IDs, for re-seeding PRNGs does not impact the predictability of the output."
Answer: B
