User: If Python, if you are developing a system service that communicates with user applications through sockets, and you want to treat sockets connected by different users differently, how would you go about that?
If I know that all connecting sockets will be from localhost, is there a way to lookup through the OS (either on windows or linux) which user is making the connection request?
Assistant: Unfortunately, at this point in time the python libraries don't support the usual SCM_CREDENTIALS method of passing credentials along a Unix socket.
You'll need to use an "ugly" method as described in another answer to find it.
