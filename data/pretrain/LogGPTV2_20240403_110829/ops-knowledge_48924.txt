User:  My website has been attacked by DDoS, please provide some common DDoS protection solutions.
Assistant: The following are several common DDoS protection solutions: 1. Traffic cleaning service: use professional traffic cleaning equipment to analyze and filter the traffic passing through it, clean out abnormal traffic, and only allow normal traffic to enter the website. 2. CDN service: Using a CDN network with multiple nodes distributed in different geographical locations, the attacker's attack source is dispersed, the attack pressure is reduced, and the accessibility of the website is improved. 3. Configure firewall: For common DDoS attack methods, configure specific firewall policies, such as DROP, to prevent attack packets from entering the target server. 4. Enhanced bandwidth: Increasing network bandwidth can distribute traffic to multiple links, reducing the effect of attacks. 5. Load balancing service: Use multiple servers to balance and distribute traffic, avoiding attacks on a single server, thereby improving the accessibility of the website. 6. Realize reverse proxy through DNS resolution: The attacker cannot find the target IP through direct attack, so as to achieve the effect of mitigating DDoS attacks.
