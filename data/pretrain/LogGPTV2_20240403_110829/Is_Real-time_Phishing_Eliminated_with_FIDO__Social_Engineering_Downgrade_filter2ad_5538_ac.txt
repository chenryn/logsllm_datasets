an undergraduate or a graduate degree (n = 46), and most
have previous experience with 2FA (n = 31).
5.4 Limitations
We designed our study to create an atmosphere that empha-
sized the importance of keeping the persona’s accounts secure.
However, participants did not use their own credentials, which
may have affected their motivation to protect these creden-
tials. The semi-structured interview along with researchers’
notes provided deeper insights in identifying reasons why
participants’ accessed links in our phishing emails. Although
one of FIDO’s design goals is ensuring security regardless
of users’ experience and anti-phishing skills [55], our results
may have been affected by participants’ lack of familiarity
with FIDO keys, and the lack of proper context for judging if
emails are following-up on real events. Additionally, our data
set is skewed towards relatively young participants who may
lack anti-phishing training usually received in work settings.
6 Analysis Methodology
We used the Qualitative Content Analysis Methodology [47]
to analyze qualitative data collected throughout the study
(e.g., post-testing interview scripts, and researchers’ notes in-
cluding participant’s comments on the content of emails and
whether they entered their credentials to the website linked
in the email). We developed an analysis matrix to cover the
main topics relevant to our research questions. The matrix
comprised of four categories with which we coded our data:
identifying phishing links, participants’ perception of FIDO,
their perception of 2FA, and their security attitude and aware-
ness. We then followed an inductive analysis method, and
performed open coding to look for interesting themes and
common patterns in the data using NVivo software. Themes
irrelevant to our research questions are not discussed herein.
As recommended by previous work [13], and similar to previ-
ous research (e.g., [16]), data was coded by a single researcher
with considerable experience in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI), security, and qualitative data analysis, so that this re-
searcher would perform rigorous analysis by being immersed
in the data. Two researchers met regularly to discuss the codes
and interpret the data. To verify the reliability of our coding,
we had a second researcher code 25% of the data individually.
We calculated Cohen’s Kappa coefﬁcient [15] to determine
inter-rater reliability, which indicated “almost perfect agree-
ment” [54] (κ = 0.82).
6.1 How to assess phishing susceptibility?
To identify participants who could be victims to our attack
in practice, we need a mapping between their behaviour in
the study and their attack susceptibility in practice. Simply
classifying those who submit their credentials to one of our
phishing links as potential victims may not be accurate be-
cause: (1) participants may not be as keen to protect their
study credentials as they would their own, and (2) partici-
pants may think they need to process all emails regardless
of their suspicion because this is what the study is asking
them to do. We took measures to reduce the impact of both
points, e.g., through emphasizing the importance of security
to the persona’s employer, and integrating actions with inter-
view responses. Only two participants mentioned they were
not paying attention because they thought it was the study’s
instructions, highlighting the importance of our measures.
Participants’ actions (during the study) and awareness of
the attacks (in the study) may or may not align. We use both
parameters, i.e., actions and awareness, to assess each partic-
ipant’s phishing susceptibility in practice; combining both
parameters yields four possible cases, which are summarized
in Table 2 (ﬁrst 3 columns). According to these two parame-
ters, we will rate each participant as susceptible, potentially
susceptible, or not susceptible to our phishing attacks in prac-
tice (column 4 in the table). (Details on how we determine
a participant’s awareness of the attacks in our study can be
found in Sec. 6.2 below.)
Normally, a participant who is unaware of our phishing
attempts would submit their credentials to our phishing web-
site. This is Case 1 in the table. A vigilant participant would
normally refrain from submitting their credentials, and con-
ﬁrm their awareness of phishing attempts in the post-study

interview—Case 4.
Cases 1 and 4 are straightforward; we classify the former
as “susceptible to phishing”, the latter as not. We classify
Cases 2 and 3 as “potentially susceptible to phishing”. In
Case 2, although they did not submit credentials, participants
are unaware of any phishing attempt. In Case 3, participants
are classiﬁed as aware, yet they submit credentials.
6.2 How to determine awareness of phishing?
Determining participants’ awareness from the interview is not
trivial. Participants responses’ varied greatly. For example,
to the above question (“If we told you that 50%...”), some
participants answered afﬁrmatively, but only name examples
of non-phishing emails. Others answered afﬁrmatively, but
said they did not remember which ones were phishing. We
also had participants who ﬁrst denied being in the 50% that
accessed fake sites, then hesitated, alternating between “yes”
and “no”, then changed their minds, and gave a few true phish-
ing examples. And there were participants that provided an
immediate afﬁrmative response, reconsidered, and ﬁnally de-
cided there were no phishing emails. We thus ignored their
direct ‘yes/no/maybe’, and instead relied on objective portions
of their comments to assess awareness, as described next.
Figure 4: Determining awareness of our phishing attempts.
Any participant who (i) identiﬁed at least one phishing
email or (ii) named a true phishing indicator is classiﬁed as
aware-of-phishing-attempts, regardless of what else was said
during the interview. Participants classiﬁed as unaware-of-
phishing-attempts included those who: just denied being in
the 50%; afﬁrmed being in the 50%, but gave only examples of
non-phishing emails; or afﬁrmed but gave only false phishing
indicators. Figure 4 shows this criteria, alongside common
example responses in our study that we discarded because the
awareness criteria was met. By true phishing indicators, we
mean the website’s URL, and commonly agreed upon (though
non-robust) signs of phishing emails [40], like typos, lack of
context, and grammatical mistakes. Unencrypted email is an
example of a false phishing indicator.
Conservative classiﬁcation of attack awareness. Follow-
ing the criteria in Fig. 4, we classiﬁed participants as aware-
of-phishing-attempts even in situations where it is hard to tell

ing attack in practice, from their study behaviour.

whether they were truly aware. Thus we provide an upper
bound on awareness. For example, a participant who named a
true phishing indicator, yet asserted seeing no phishing emails
is still classiﬁed as aware-of-phishing-attempts. Classiﬁed
likewise is a participant who gave an example of one phishing
email, mistakenly identiﬁed two non-phishing emails, and as-
serted there were no other phishing emails (i.e., missing three
others). We used conservative criteria for two reasons: (1) we
increase certainty that participants classiﬁed as unaware-of-
phishing-attempts would most likely be unaware of similar
attempts in practice, and (2) participants may have forgot-
ten which emails were truly phishing by the time they reach
the post-study interview (there were 15 emails in total). We
purposefully avoided showing each of the 15 emails to partic-
ipants and asking them which were phishing to avoid priming.
Our hypothesis here is that, if during the study, a participant
suspected a phishing attempt, they would recall that and indi-
cate it in a manner captured by the criteria in Fig. 4.
Conservative classiﬁcation of attack susceptibility. We
determined susceptibility based on two factors that we ﬁrst
assessed independently: awareness and submission of creden-
tials. “Awareness” is not per email, but per participant. So
even if a participant named one phishing email but missed all
others (or asserted there were no others), we still classify them
as aware-of-phishing-attempts. When we check whether this
participant submitted credentials to our phishing website, we
do not match the phishing email they fell for in the study with
the email they named in the interview. For example, a partici-
pant who noticed only one phishing email, E2, is classiﬁed as
aware-of-phishing-attempts, even if they asserted there were
no others. If this participant submits credentials upon clicking
on the link in any phishing email (E2 or another), we classify
them as “potentially susceptible”, not as “susceptible”. One
would argue that this is a “susceptible” participant because
an email successfully phished their credentials. Being conser-
vative, we opt to use any minor indication that a participant
might notice similar attacks in practice as grounds for avoid-
ing classiﬁcation as “susceptible”. By classifying only the
most blatant case as “susceptible”, we provide a lower bound
for susceptibility to attacks.
Examples of aware participants. From our analysis, the
following are examples classiﬁed as aware-of-phishing-

this Sam Logan is a phishing [email]. [...] he [emailed] twice,
it could be... I don’t know. If I got phishing, this is the only
email I feel it could be.”. P17-N said, “Yes, [I was in the
50%] [...] I was taking it for granted that the emails I was
getting from the employees at the company were legitimate.
[...] So I think that Sam Logan ones were, at least the one that
I got from Sam Logan on the Friday was deﬁnitely a phishing
email [...] Now that I’m thinking about it, that was deﬁnitely
a phishing email, because of how poorly worded it was.”.
P25-E said, “I received many phishing emails here (identiﬁed
them correctly during the study). I think there were two types,
ﬁrst the email about account change. The address looked it is
coming from the source but as the company doesn’t have any
encryption I cannot be sure. I would have gone physically to
the person. And the others that asked for google credentials,
for those I just checked the address.”
Examples of unaware. P10-N said, “I don’t think so. [...]
Everything seemed legitimate enough and seemed business-y.
And I look[ed], everything looks like pretty work-related and
exactly related to what the e-mail said it would be. Yeah. It
wasn’t like I just clicked on a link and it really brought me to
some random page or something, it was related to what the
e-mail was saying. So it seems legitimate to me.”. P13-N said,
“I just went to hotmail, the outlook website which I very often
go. And I logged in from there. So I think it seemed ﬁne.”
7 Results
Through our data analysis, we looked for an effect of location
by comparing data from the North American and European
cities where the studies were conducted; we found no clear
distinctions between the two groups. Our qualitative analysis
did not reveal themes distinct to either city and we found no
statistically signiﬁcant difference between the two groups’
susceptibility to phishing attacks (X 2(2,N = 51) = 1.64, p =
.44). We thus discuss the amalgamated results, within the
context of the two research questions in Sec. 1.
7.1 Phishing Susceptibility with FIDO (RQ1)
Table 2 summarizes the results; 57% of participants (Cases 1
+ 2) were classiﬁed as “unaware of phishing attempts”, and
all but one of these participants (P12-E) submitted credentials
to our phishing website. Given our conservative measures in
classifying susceptibility, our results suggest that at least 55%
(Case 1) of participants would be susceptible to our phishing
attacks in practice. The one participant in Case 2, P12-E, was
very rapid in going over the emails. She did not click on any
phishing link, and also ignored several non-phishing links.
She gave very short, non-informative, responses in the post-
study interview. When asked why she did not click on links in
the emails, she simply said, “There is no particular reason”.
In contrast, 43% of participants (Cases 3 + 4) were classiﬁed
as aware of phishing attempts, but only the Case 4 participants
(10% of all participants) are likely to detect the discussed
phishing attempts in practice. A Fisher’s Exact Test suggests
that participants who were aware of phishing attempts were
less likely to submit their credentials than those who were
unaware (p = .047,N = 51). Contrarily, Fisher’s Exact Tests
showed that neither gender (p = .60,N = 51), generation6
(p = .34,N = 51), nor having work experience (p = .23,N =
51) signiﬁcantly inﬂuence susceptibility to phishing.
7.1.1 Takeaway
Our focus in the present paper is to determine user’s suscepti-
bility to phishing, particularly while using FIDO. We noticed
that all participants who appear to have detected and avoided
our phishing attempts (Case 4) would have done so also with-
out using FIDO. The phishing indicators they mentioned, and
the reasons they discussed as to why they avoided submitting
credentials to our phishing site are not related to FIDO. Like-
wise, those whom we classiﬁed as susceptible to phishing are
susceptible despite using FIDO. That is, using FIDO did not
protect them from our downgrade attacks. Essentially, what
we were looking for in this research is cases of users who
would have fallen for phishing without FIDO, but have not
because of using FIDO. We found none.
7.2 Phishing detection while using FIDO (RQ2)
When we asked participants if they had accessed fake web-
sites during their session, participants were evoked to think
about the emails more deeply, and discuss reasons they used
to classify emails as phishing or safe. Through our analysis
of qualitative data, we found that participants relied mostly
on general phishing indicators for determining whether the
emails they received were phishing. Table 3 summarizes rea-
sons why participants classiﬁed an email as phishing (seven),
and reasons for classifying an email as safe (eleven).
7.2.1 Reasons for classifying emails as phishing
We grouped the phishing indicators discussed by participants
into two categories: technical, and non-technical. The two
technical indicators were suspicious URL, and that the re-
peated login prompts were unusual behaviour. P2-N explains,
“It wants [me] to log onto Google even though I was already
logged on to Google on just another tab[...] This was not a
thing I noticed at the beginning when I was doing the experi-
ment [...]. Now that I’m thinking about it. Yeah, makes sense,
right? Like why are they asking you to log onto Google again
when you’re already logged onto Google?!”
6We assigned generation labels, based on participants’ ages, as in [49].

Although the identiﬁed technical indicators can alert users,
they are not ideal from a usability perspective. Users do not
always check the URL bar [42], and even if checked, users
do not necessarily know the correct URL [6]. Users may also
lack a proper understanding of the structure of URLs to be
able to assess their legitimacy [6, 19, 92]. In addition, it is
unlikely that typical end users would know that a website
would only require users to re-login if the session cookie
has expired (the three participants discussing the repeated
login indicator had studied Computer Science or Computer
