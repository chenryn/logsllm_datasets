on Linux systems, and it has complete control of Kali.
To perform operations in Linux, you enter commands along with any
relevant options. For example, to view the contents of root’s home directory,
enter the command ls as shown here.
root@kali:~# ls
Desktop
As you can see, there’s not much in the root directory, only a folder
called Desktop.
the Linux Filesystem
In the Linux world, everything is a file: keyboards, printers, network
devices—everything. All files can be viewed, edited, deleted, created,
and moved. The Linux filesystem is made up of a series of directories
that branch off from the root of the filesystem (/).
To see your current directory, enter pwd at the terminal:
root@kali:~# pwd
/root
Changing Directories
To move to another directory, enter cd directory using either the absolute or
relative path to the new directory, based your current location. The absolute
path is the path to a file in relation to the root directory (/). For example, to
change to your desktop from anywhere, you could enter the absolute path
to the desktop with cd /root/Desktop to reach the root user’s desktop. If you
were in the directory /root (the root user’s home directory), you could use
the relative path to the desktop (that is, relative to your current location) by
entering cd Desktop, which would also take you to the desktop.
The command cd .. takes you back one level in the filesystem, as
shown here.
root@kali:~/Desktop# cd ..
root@kali:~/# cd ../etc
root@kali:/etc#
56 Chapter 2
Entering cd .. from root’s Desktop directory takes us back to root’s home
directory. Entering cd ../etc from there moves us back up to the root of the
filesystem and then to the /etc directory.
Learning about Commands: the man Pages
To learn more about a command and its options and arguments, you can
view its documentation (called its manual page, or man page) by entering man
command. For example, to learn more about the ls command enter man ls as
shown in Listing 2-1.
root@kali:~# man ls
LS(1) User Commands LS(1)
NAME
ls - list directory contents
SYNOPSIS
ls [OPTION]... [FILE]... u
DESCRIPTION v
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is speci-
fied.
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
too.
-a, --all w
do not ignore entries starting with .
-A, --almost-all
do not list implied . and ..
--snip--
-l use a long listing format
--snip--
Listing 2-1: Linux man page
The man page gives useful (if a bit unfriendly looking) information
about the ls command including its usage u, description v, and available
options w.
As you can see in the description section at v, the ls command lists all
files in the current working directory by default, but you can also use ls to
get information about a particular file. For example, according to the man
page you can use the -a option with ls to show all files, including hidden
directories—directories not shown in the default ls listing—as shown in
Listing 2-2.
Using Kali Linux 57
root@kali:~# ls -a
. .mozilla
.. .msf4
.android .mysql_history
.bash_history .nano_history
--snip--
Listing 2-2: Using an option with ls
As you can see, there are several hidden directories in the root direc-
tory, all of which are preceded by a period (.) character. (In Chapter 8,
we’ll see how these sometimes-hidden directories can lead to a system com-
promise.) You can also see the entries . and .., which denote the current
directory and the parent directory, respectively.
user Privileges
Linux user accounts offer resources to a particular individual or service.
A user may log in with a password and be offered certain resources on the
Linux system, such as the ability to write files and browse the Internet.
That user may not be able to see files that belong to other users and can
have reasonable assurance that other users can’t see his or her files either.
In addition to traditional user accounts used by a person who logs in with a
password and accesses the system, Linux systems can allow software to have
a user account. The software can have the ability to use system resources
to do its job, but it cannot read other users’ private files. The accepted best
practice on Linux systems is to run day-to-day commands as an unprivileged
user account instead of running everything as the privileged root user to
avoid inadvertently harming your system or granting excessive privilege to
the commands and applications you run.
Adding a User
By default, Kali offers only the privileged root account. Though many
security tools require root privileges to run, you may want to add another
unprivileged account for everyday use to reduce the potential for damage
to your system. Remember, the root account can do anything on Linux,
including corrupting all of your files.
To add a new user georgia to your Kali system use the adduser command,
as shown in Listing 2-3.
root@kali:~# adduser georgia
Adding user `georgia' ...
Adding new group `georgia' (1000) ...
Adding new user `georgia' (1000) with group `georgia' ... u
Creating home directory `/home/georgia' ... v
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password: w
Retype new UNIX password:
58 Chapter 2
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for georgia
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
Full Name []: Georgia Weidman x
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y
Listing 2-3: Adding a new user
As you can see, in addition to adding a user to the system, a group georgia
is created, a new user is added to this group u, a home directory is created
for the user v, and the system prompts for information about the user, such
as a password w and the user’s full name x.
Adding a User to the sudoers File
When you need to do something that requires root privileges as a regular
user, use the sudo command along with the command that you want to run
as root, and then enter your password. For the newly created user georgia
to be able to run privileged commands you need to add her to the sudoers
file, which specifies which users can use the sudo command. To do so, enter
adduser username sudo as shown here.
root@kali:~# adduser georgia sudo
Adding user 'georgia' to group `sudo' ...
Adding user georgia to group sudo
Done.
Switching Users and Using sudo
To switch users in your terminal session, say from the root user to georgia,
use the su command as shown in Listing 2-4.
root@kali:~# su georgia
georgia@kali:/root$ adduser john
bash: adduser: command not found u
georgia@kali:/root$ sudo adduser john
[sudo] password for georgia:
Adding user `john' ... v
Adding new group `john' (1002) ...
Adding new user `john' (1002) with group `john' ...
--snip--
georgia@kali:/root$ su
Password:
root@kali:~#
Listing 2-4: Switching to a different user
Using Kali Linux 59
You switch users with the su command. If you try to run commands
(such as the adduser command) that require more privileges than the cur-
rent user (georgia), the command is unsuccessful (command not found) u
because you can run the adduser command only as root.
Luckily, as discussed previously, you can use the sudo command to run
a command as root. Because the georgia user is a member of the sudo group,
you can run privileged commands, and you can see user john is added v to
the system.
To change back to the root user, enter the su command with no user-
name. You will be prompted for the root’s password (toor).
Creating a New File or Directory
To create a new, empty file called myfile, use the touch command.
root@kali:# touch myfile
To create a new directory in your current working directory, enter mkdir
directory as shown here.
root@kali:~# mkdir mydirectory
root@kali:~# ls
Desktop mydirectory myfile
root@kali:~# cd mydirectory/
Use ls to confirm that the new directory has been created, and then
change to mydirectory using cd.
Copying, Moving, and Removing Files
To copy a file, use the cp command as shown here.
root@kali:/mydirectory# cp /root/myfile myfile2
The syntax is cp source destination. When using cp, the original file is
left in place, and a copy is made at the desired destination.
Similarly, you can move a file from one location to another using the
mv command. The syntax is identical to cp, but this time the file is removed
from the source location.
You can remove a file from the filesystem by entering rm file. To
remove files recursively use the -r command.
warning Be careful when removing files, particularly recursively! Some hackers joke that the
first command to teach Linux beginners is rm -rf from the root directory, which forci-
bly deletes the entire filesystem. This teaches new users the power of performing actions
as root. Don’t try that at home!
60 Chapter 2
Adding Text to a File
The echo command echoes what you enter to the terminal, as shown here.
root@kali:/mydirectory# echo hello georgia
hello georgia
To save text to a file, you can redirect your input to a file instead of to
the terminal with the > symbol.
root@kali:/mydirectory# echo hello georgia > myfile
To see the contents of your new file you can use the cat command.
root@kali:/mydirectory# cat myfile
hello georgia
Now echo a different line of text into myfile as shown next.
root@kali:# echo hello georgia again > myfile
root@kali:/mydirectory# cat myfile
hello georgia again
The > overwrites the previous contents of the file. If you echo another
line into myfile, that new line overwrites the output of the previous com-
mand. As you can see, the contents of myfile now reads hello georgia again.
Appending Text to a File
To append text to a file, use >> as shown here.
root@kali:/mydirectory# echo hello georgia a third time >> myfile
root@kali:/mydirectory# cat myfile
hello georgia again
hello georgia a third time
As you can see, appending preserves the previous contents of the file.
File Permissions
If you look at the long output of ls -l on myfile, you can see the current per-
missions for myfile.
root@kali:~/mydirectory# ls -l myfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 47 Apr 23 21:15 myfile
From left to right you see the file type and permissions (-rw-r—r--), the
number of links to the file (1), the user and group that own the file (root),
the file size (47 bytes), the last time the file was edited (April 23, 21:15), and
finally the filename (myfile).
Using Kali Linux 61
Linux files have permissions to read (r), write (w), and execute (x) and
three sets of user permissions: permissions for the owner, the group, and
all users. The first three letters denote the permissions for the owner, the
following three denote the permissions for the group, and the final three
denote the permissions for all users. Since you created myfile from the root
user account, the file is owned by user root and group root, as you can see in
the output with root root. User root has read and write permissions for the
file (rw). Other users in the group, if there are any, can read the file (r) but
not write to or execute it. The last r shows that all users on the filesystem
can read the file.
To change permissions on a file, use the chmod command. You can use
chmod to specify permissions for the owner, the group, and the world. When
specifying permissions use the numbers from 0 through 7 as shown in
Table 2-1.
table 2-1: Linux File Permissions
Integer Value Permissions Binary representation
7 full 111
6 read and write 110
5 read and execute 101
4 read only 100
3 write and execute 011
2 write only 010
1 execute only 001
0 none 000
When entering new file permissions, you use one digit for the owner,
one for the group, and one for world. For example, to give the owner full
permissions but the group and the world no permissions to read, write, or
execute a file, use chmod 700 like this:
root@kali:~/mydirectory# chmod 700 myfile
root@kali:~/mydirectory# ls -l myfile
-rwx------u 1 root root 47 Apr 23 21:15 myfile
Now when you run the ls -l command on myfile, you can see that root
has read, write, and execute (rwx) permissions and the other sets are blank u.
If you try to access the file as any user other than root, you’ll get a permis-
sion denied error.
editing Files
Perhaps no debate brings out such passion among Linux users as which is
the best file editor. We’ll look at the basics of using two popular editors, vi
and nano, beginning with my favorite, nano.
62 Chapter 2
root@kali:~/mydirectory# nano testfile.txt
Once in nano you can begin adding text to a new file called testfile.txt.
When you open nano, you should see a blank file with help information for
nano shown at the bottom of the screen, as shown here.
[ New File ]
^G Get Help ^O WriteOut ^R Read File ^Y Prev Page ^K Cut Text ^C Cur Pos
^X Exit ^J Justify ^W Where Is ^V Next Page ^U UnCut Text^T To Spell
To add text to the file, just start typing.
Searching for Text
To search for text in a file, use ctrl-W, and then enter the text to search for
at the search prompt as shown next.
--snip--
Search:georgia
^G Get Help ^Y First Line^T Go To Line^W Beg of ParM-J FullJstifM-B Backwards
^C Cancel ^V Last Line ^R Replace ^O End of ParM-C Case SensM-R Regexp
Nano should find the text georgia if the word is in the file. To exit,
press ctrl-X. You will be prompted to save the file or lose the changes,
as shown here:
