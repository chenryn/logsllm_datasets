### Linux System Operations and File Management

#### Introduction
In Linux systems, Kali has complete control. To perform operations, you enter commands along with any relevant options. For example, to view the contents of the root’s home directory, use the `ls` command:

```bash
root@kali:~# ls
Desktop
```

As shown, the root directory contains only a folder named `Desktop`.

#### The Linux Filesystem
In Linux, everything is treated as a file, including keyboards, printers, and network devices. Files can be viewed, edited, deleted, created, and moved. The Linux filesystem is hierarchical, branching from the root directory (`/`).

To determine your current directory, use the `pwd` command:

```bash
root@kali:~# pwd
/root
```

#### Changing Directories
To navigate to another directory, use the `cd` command with either an absolute or relative path. The absolute path starts from the root directory, while the relative path is based on your current location.

- **Absolute Path Example:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:~# cd /root/Desktop
  ```

- **Relative Path Example:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:~# cd Desktop
  ```

To move up one level in the filesystem, use `cd ..`:

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop# cd ..
root@kali:~/# cd ../etc
root@kali:/etc#
```

#### Learning about Commands: Man Pages
To learn more about a command and its options, use the `man` command followed by the command name. For example, to learn about the `ls` command:

```bash
root@kali:~# man ls
```

The man page provides detailed information, including usage, description, and available options. For instance, the `-a` option with `ls` shows all files, including hidden ones:

```bash
root@kali:~# ls -a
. .mozilla
.. .msf4
.android .mysql_history
.bash_history .nano_history
--snip--
```

#### User Privileges
Linux user accounts provide specific resources to individuals or services. Users can log in with a password and access system resources, but they may not see other users' files. Running commands as an unprivileged user is a best practice to avoid accidental damage or excessive privilege.

#### Adding a User
Kali typically offers only the privileged root account. To add an unprivileged user, use the `adduser` command:

```bash
root@kali:~# adduser georgia
Adding user `georgia' ...
Adding new group `georgia' (1000) ...
Creating home directory `/home/georgia' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for georgia
Full Name []: Georgia Weidman
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y
```

#### Adding a User to the sudoers File
To allow a user to run commands with root privileges, add them to the `sudo` group:

```bash
root@kali:~# adduser georgia sudo
Adding user 'georgia' to group `sudo' ...
Done.
```

#### Switching Users and Using sudo
To switch users, use the `su` command. To run commands with root privileges, use `sudo`:

```bash
root@kali:~# su georgia
georgia@kali:/root$ sudo adduser john
[sudo] password for georgia:
Adding user `john' ...
--snip--
```

#### Creating a New File or Directory
To create a new file, use the `touch` command. To create a new directory, use the `mkdir` command:

```bash
root@kali:~# touch myfile
root@kali:~# mkdir mydirectory
root@kali:~# ls
Desktop mydirectory myfile
root@kali:~# cd mydirectory/
```

#### Copying, Moving, and Removing Files
- **Copy a file:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:/mydirectory# cp /root/myfile myfile2
  ```

- **Move a file:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:/mydirectory# mv /root/myfile myfile3
  ```

- **Remove a file:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:/mydirectory# rm myfile
  ```

- **Remove files recursively:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:/mydirectory# rm -r mydirectory
  ```

**Warning:** Be cautious when using `rm -rf /` as it will delete the entire filesystem.

#### Adding Text to a File
Use the `echo` command to write text to a file:

```bash
root@kali:/mydirectory# echo hello georgia > myfile
root@kali:/mydirectory# cat myfile
hello georgia
```

To overwrite the file, use `>`. To append text, use `>>`:

```bash
root@kali:/mydirectory# echo hello georgia again >> myfile
root@kali:/mydirectory# cat myfile
hello georgia
hello georgia again
```

#### File Permissions
File permissions can be viewed using `ls -l` and modified with `chmod`. Permissions are represented by three sets: owner, group, and others.

- **View permissions:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:~/mydirectory# ls -l myfile
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 47 Apr 23 21:15 myfile
  ```

- **Change permissions:**
  ```bash
  root@kali:~/mydirectory# chmod 700 myfile
  root@kali:~/mydirectory# ls -l myfile
  -rwx------ 1 root root 47 Apr 23 21:15 myfile
  ```

#### Editing Files
Popular text editors in Linux include `vi` and `nano`. Here’s how to use `nano`:

```bash
root@kali:~/mydirectory# nano testfile.txt
```

To search for text, press `Ctrl-W` and enter the search term. To exit, press `Ctrl-X` and save changes if prompted.
