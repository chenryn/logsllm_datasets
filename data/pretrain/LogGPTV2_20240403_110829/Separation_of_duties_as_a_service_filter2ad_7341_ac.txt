The matrix in Exhibit 6 identifies the high‐risk tasks performed by 
Utilities and the separation of duties needed. We encourage 
Utilities to continue implementing recommendations of previous 
audits to strengthen their processes, which will also strengthen 
the area of separation of duties.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
The Information Technology (IT) Department is responsible for 
the overall operational duties for the ERP system, including 
development, maintenance, and administration. The matrix in 
Exhibit 7 identifies the high‐risk tasks and the separation of 
duties needed in these areas.

High‐Risk Areas 
ERP Planning: Separation of Duties 
The IT Department has two distinct roles in the area of 
separation of duties: 1) within the IT Department as identified in 
the matrix, and 2) as support for all the work areas throughout 
the City. As with other work areas, separation of duties is 
tempered by the size of the IT staff; however, where separation 
of duties is not enforced, compensating controls are critical to 
reduce the risk. 
Within the IT department, generally, the following separation of 
duties are key: 
  Computer operators should be prohibited from making 
changes to programs and data. 
  System development staff should not have physical access to 
computer rooms and not have update access to production 
data. 
  Technical support staff should not have access to application 
programs, production data, or physical access to the 
computer room. 
System access controls are an important part of IT’s role in 
maintaining effective separation of duties. IT should be aware of 
and responsive to all the key components of access control, 
including authentication of who is given access, authorization 
toward what they are given access to do, an audit trail to identify 
what they have done, and administration to maintain privileges 
and manage administrators. 
The IT department, responding to a prior SAP Security audit and a 
consultant’s review of the City’s separation of duties, has 
implemented positive changes to their separation of duties 
processes around access control. Their separation of duties policy 
has been updated to provide clarity regarding roles and 
responsibilities, for both IT staff and end users. A key, beneficial 
change is that the IT Service Desk is now responsible for resetting 
SAP passwords, which separated the SAP Basis Team’s ability to 
have access to SAP user account creation and modification and 
password reset. 
One area that should be reviewed for improvement during the 
ERP design and implementation period is the redefining of user 
access profile and roles. Defining user access by profiles and roles 
assignment is effective; however, how the profiles and roles are

defined and using the concept of least privilege are important to 
mitigating separation of duties. Least privilege is the concept and 
practice of restricting access rights for users, accounts, and 
computing processes to only those absolutely required to 
perform routine, legitimate activities. Applied to people, least 
privilege means enforcing the minimal level of user rights, or 
lowest clearance level, that allows the user to perform his/her 
role. In the previous separation of duties examples, we identified 
areas where transactional access was given to users 
unnecessarily. 
IT provides support to the various work areas. Our general review 
did not identify conflicts for concern; however, we would like to 
reiterate that where separation of duties is not possible due to 
limited staff, it is especially important for the end‐user 
department to: 
  Authorize transactions. 
  Reconcile input/output and run‐to‐run cycles. 
  Control changes to master files. 
  Control resubmission of rejected transactions. 
  Restrict access to assets such as cash, blank checks, 
negotiable documents and inventory. 
Attachment AERP Planning: Separation of Duties 
To help ensure that the City adopts best practices for separation 
of duties when transitioning to the City’s new ERP system, we 
recommend that the City Manager direct all departments to 
consult with the Information Technology Department to adopt 
practices for ensuring separation of duties for high‐risk 
conflicting tasks, based on the matrices in Finding 1, or develop 
mitigating controls where conflicts cannot be avoided. 
Specifically, we recommend that: 
1.  Administrative Services: 
a)  Transfer the task of entering Accounts Payable 
invoices to ASD Administration and either discontinue 
Account Payable’s SAP access for entering invoices or, 
if not possible, create a procedure that can identify 
if/when an Accounts Payable invoice is entered by an 
Accounts Payable employee for supervisory review. 
b)  Have Payroll redesign the existing manual controls to 
mitigate against the high‐risk areas of SoD conflict 
identified. 
c)  Share with Utilities all relevant SoD practices adopted, 
and Utilities practices should be consistent with that 
of ASD. 
2.  Information Technology revisit the design and definition of 
profiles and roles according to the concept of least privilege, 
where possible.

Recommendations

APPENDIX 1 – City Manager’s Response

The City Manager has agreed to take the following actions in response to the audit recommendations in this report. The City Manager will report 
progress on implementation six months after the Council accepts the audit report, and every six months thereafter until all recommendations have been 
implemented.

Finding 1: Implementing effective separation of duties and ensuring well‐restricted user access controls for the new ERP system will decrease 
vulnerabilities and risks. 
To help ensure that the City adopts best practices for separation of duties when transitioning to the City’s new ERP system, we recommend that the City 
Manager direct all departments to consult with the Information Technology Department to adopt practices for ensuring separation of duties for high‐risk 
conflicting tasks, based on the matrices in Finding 1, or develop mitigating controls where conflicts cannot be avoided. Specifically, we recommend: 
1.a. Transfer the task of entering

1a. Explore the possibility of 
transferring the task of entering 
Accounts Payable invoices to 
ASD Administration.

redesign the existing manual 
controls to mitigate against the 
high‐risk areas of SoD conflict 
identified in the new ERP.

The plan is to review and 
modify as appropriate the 
approach to profiles and roles 
during the design and 
implementation phases of the 
new ERP system. If it makes 
sense timing wise, the new 
design will be incorporated 
back into the legacy system 
during the project. 
Determination of value and 
cost in retrofitting to the legacy 
system will be made during 
design.
