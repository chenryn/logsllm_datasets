### Exhibit 6: High-Risk Tasks and Separation of Duties for Utilities

The matrix in Exhibit 6 identifies high-risk tasks performed by the Utilities department and the necessary separation of duties. We recommend that Utilities continue to implement the recommendations from previous audits to strengthen their processes, which will also enhance the area of separation of duties.

### Information Technology (IT) Department

The IT Department is responsible for the overall operational duties of the ERP system, including development, maintenance, and administration. The matrix in Exhibit 7 outlines the high-risk tasks and the required separation of duties in these areas.

### High-Risk Areas: ERP Planning and Separation of Duties

The IT Department has two primary roles in the area of separation of duties:
1. Within the IT Department, as identified in the matrix.
2. As support for all work areas throughout the City.

Separation of duties can be challenging due to the size of the IT staff; however, where separation is not possible, compensating controls are essential to mitigate risks.

#### Key Separations of Duties within the IT Department:

- **Computer Operators:** Should be prohibited from making changes to programs and data.
- **System Development Staff:** Should not have physical access to computer rooms or update access to production data.
- **Technical Support Staff:** Should not have access to application programs, production data, or physical access to the computer room.

#### System Access Controls

System access controls are a critical part of maintaining effective separation of duties. The IT Department should be aware of and responsive to all key components of access control, including:
- **Authentication:** Verifying who is given access.
- **Authorization:** Defining what they are allowed to do.
- **Audit Trail:** Tracking what they have done.
- **Administration:** Managing privileges and administrators.

#### Recent Improvements

The IT Department has implemented positive changes in response to a prior SAP Security audit and a consultant’s review of the City’s separation of duties. These changes include:
- Updating the separation of duties policy to clarify roles and responsibilities for both IT staff and end users.
- Transferring the responsibility for resetting SAP passwords to the IT Service Desk, thereby separating the SAP Basis Team’s ability to create, modify, and reset user accounts.

#### User Access Profiles and Roles

During the ERP design and implementation period, it is important to redefine user access profiles and roles. Defining user access through profiles and roles is effective, but it is crucial to apply the principle of least privilege. This means restricting access rights to only those absolutely necessary for routine, legitimate activities. In previous examples, we identified instances where transactional access was unnecessarily granted to users.

#### Support to Various Work Areas

Our general review did not identify any significant conflicts. However, we emphasize that where separation of duties is not possible due to limited staff, it is especially important for the end-user department to:
- Authorize transactions.
- Reconcile input/output and run-to-run cycles.
- Control changes to master files.
- Control resubmission of rejected transactions.
- Restrict access to assets such as cash, blank checks, negotiable documents, and inventory.

### Recommendations

To ensure the City adopts best practices for separation of duties during the transition to the new ERP system, we recommend that the City Manager direct all departments to consult with the IT Department to adopt practices for ensuring separation of duties for high-risk conflicting tasks, based on the matrices in Finding 1, or develop mitigating controls where conflicts cannot be avoided.

#### Specific Recommendations:

1. **Administrative Services:**
   - Transfer the task of entering Accounts Payable invoices to ASD Administration and either discontinue Accounts Payable’s SAP access for entering invoices or, if not possible, create a procedure to identify when an Accounts Payable invoice is entered by an Accounts Payable employee for supervisory review.
   - Have Payroll redesign existing manual controls to mitigate high-risk areas of SoD conflict.
   - Share all relevant SoD practices adopted with Utilities, ensuring consistency with ASD practices.

2. **Information Technology:**
   - Revisit the design and definition of profiles and roles according to the concept of least privilege, where possible.

### Appendix 1: City Manager’s Response

The City Manager has agreed to take the following actions in response to the audit recommendations. Progress on implementation will be reported six months after the Council accepts the audit report, and every six months thereafter until all recommendations are implemented.

**Finding 1: Implementing Effective Separation of Duties and Ensuring Well-Restricted User Access Controls for the New ERP System**

**Recommendation 1.a:**
- **Corrective Action Plan:** Explore the possibility of transferring the task of entering Accounts Payable invoices to ASD Administration.
- **Target Date:** With the new ERP.
- **Current Status:** In progress.

**Recommendation 1.b:**
- **Corrective Action Plan:** Explore having Payroll redesign the existing manual controls to mitigate high-risk areas of SoD conflict in the new ERP.
- **Target Date:** With the new ERP.
- **Current Status:** In progress.

**Recommendation 1.c:**
- **Corrective Action Plan:** Share with Utilities all relevant SoD practices adopted, ensuring consistency with ASD practices.
- **Target Date:** June 30, 2020.
- **Current Status:** In progress.

**Recommendation 2:**
- **Corrective Action Plan:** Review and modify the approach to profiles and roles during the design and implementation phases of the new ERP system. If feasible, incorporate the new design into the legacy system during the project. Determine the value and cost of retrofitting the legacy system during the design phase.
- **Target Date:** Ongoing.
- **Current Status:** In progress.
