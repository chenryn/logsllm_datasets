User: I'm running a Python Tornado server with a WebSocket handler.
We've noticed that if we abruptly disconnect the a client (disconnect a cable for example) the server has no indication the connection was broken. No on_close event is raised.
Is there a workaround? 
I've read there's an option to send a ping, but didn't see anyone use it in the examples online and not sure how to use it and if it will address this issue.
Assistant: The on_close event can only be triggered when the connection is closed.
You can send a ping and wait for an on_pong event.
Timouts are typically hard to detect since you won't even get a message that the socket is closed.
