### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues and FAQs in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate. 

### Environment
- **Dubbo version:** 2.7.1
- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Java version:** 1.8
- **Dubbo Spring Boot Starter:** 2.7.0

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue

#### Configuration
```yaml
dubbo:
  protocol:
    port: 20880
  registry:
    address: N/A
    check: false
  consumer:
    check: false
```

#### Code Snippet
```java
@Controller
public class AppController {
    @Reference(check = false)
    private UserService userService;
}
```

### Exception
```java
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'appController': Injection of @org.apache.dubbo.config.annotation.Reference dependencies failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: No such any registry to reference com.epipe.ucloud.crm.service.sys.UserService on the consumer 192.168.3.177 using Dubbo version 2.7.1, please configure the registry in your Spring configuration.

Note: The `check=false` setting does not seem to be taking effect.
```

### Additional Information
- The `check=false` setting is intended to disable the health check for the service, but it appears to be ineffective in this scenario.
- The `registry.address` is set to `N/A`, which might be causing the issue as there is no valid registry configured.
