Answers to Domain 1 Review Questions
1. Answer: B
Explanation: Deterrent frameworks are technology-related and used to discourage malicious activities. For
example, an intrusion prevention system or a firewall would be appropriate in this framework.
There are three other primary control frameworks. A preventative framework helps establish security policies and
security awareness training. A detective framework is focused on finding unauthorized activity in your environment
after a security incident. A corrective framework focuses on activities to get your environment back after a security
incident. There isn’t an assessment framework.
2. Answer: B
Explanation: You have three risk analysis methods to choose from: qualitative (which uses a risk analysis matrix),
quantitative (which uses money or metrics to compute), or hybrid (a combination of qualitative and quantitative
but not an answer choice in this scenario). Because the ISP has monitoring and log data, you should use a
quantitative approach; it will help quantify the chances of additional customers experiencing a security risk.
STRIDE is used for threat modeling. A market approach is used for asset valuation. A reduction analysis attempts
to eliminate duplicate analysis and is tied to threat modeling.
3. Answer: B
Explanation: The RTO establishes the maximum amount of time the organization will be down (or how long it takes
to recover), the RPO establishes the maximum data loss that is tolerable, the MTD covers the maximum tolerable
downtime, and MDT is just a made-up phrase used as a distraction. In this scenario, with the focus on the data loss,
the correct answer is RPO.

Domain 2. Asset Security
When we think about assets, some people consider only physical assets, such as buildings, land and computers. But asset
security for the CISSP exam focuses on virtual assets such as intellectual property and data. (In Domain 3, there will be some
physical security topics.)
2.1 Identify and classify information and assets
To improve security, you need to identify both your data and your physical assets and classify them according to their
importance or sensitivity, so you can specify procedures for handling them appropriately based on their classification.
 Data classification. Organizations classify their data using labels. You might be familiar with two government
classification labels, Secret and Top Secret. Non-government organizations generally use classification labels such
as Public, Internal Use Only, Partner Use Only, or Company Confidential. However, data classification can be more
granular; for example, you might label certain information as HR Only.
 Asset classification. You also need to identify and classify physical assets, such as computers, smartphones, desks
and company cars. Unlike data, assets are typically identified and classified by asset type. Often, asset classification
is used for accounting purposes, but it can also be tied to information security. For example, an organization might
designate a set of special laptops with particular software installed, and assign them to employees when they travel
to high-risk destinations, so their day-to-day assets can remain safely at home.
Classification labels help users disseminate data and assets properly. For example, if Sue has a document classified as
Partner Use Only, she knows that it can be distributed only to partners; any further distribution is a violation of security
policy. In addition, some data loss prevention solutions can use classification data to help protect company data
automatically. For example, an email server can prevent documents classified as Internal Use Only from being sent outside
of the organization.
People with the right clearance can view certain classifications of data or check out certain types of company equipment
(such as a company truck). While clearance is often associated with governments or the military, it is also useful for
organizations. Some organizations use it routinely throughout their environments, while other organizations use it for
special scenarios, such as a merger or acquisition. When studying for this section, concentrate on understanding the
following concepts:
 Clearance. Clearance dictates who has access to what. Generally, a certain clearance provides access to a certain
classification of data or certain types of equipment. For example, Secret clearance gives access to Secret
documents, and a law enforcement organization might require a particular clearance level for use of heavy
weaponry.
 Formal access approval. Whenever a user needs to gain access to data or assets that they don’t currently have
access to, there should be a formal approval process. The process should involve approval from the data owner,
who should be provided with details about the access being requested. Before a user is granted access to the data,
they should be told the rules and limits of working with it. For example, they should be aware that they must not
send documents outside the organization if they are classified as Internal Only.
23
 Need to know. Suppose your company is acquiring another company but it hasn’t been announced yet. The CIO,
who is aware of the acquisition, needs to have IT staff review some redacted network diagrams as part of the due
diligence process. In such a scenario, the IT staff is given only the information they need to know (for example, that
it is a network layout and the company is interested in its compatibility with its own network). The IT staff do not
need to know about the acquisition at that time. This is “need to know.”
2.2 Determine and maintain information and asset ownership
If you don’t know who owns a piece of data, how can you go through a formal access approval process? You can’t, at least
not as effectively. Similarly, you can’t properly account for assets if you don’t know which department owns them, or assign
the right type of laptop for high-risk travel if you don’t have the assets classified.
Data owners are responsible for classifying the data they own. In larger companies, an asset management department
handles asset classification. A custodian is a hands-on role that implements and operates solutions for data (e.g., backups
and restores). A system owner is responsible for the computer environment (hardware, software) that houses data; this is
typically a management role with operational tasks handed off to the custodian.
2.3 Protect privacy
All workers need to be aware of the company’s privacy policies and procedures and know how to contact data owners in
the event of an issue. Key terms to understand include the following:
 Data owners. Data owners are usually members of the management or senior management team. They approve
access to data (usually by approving the data access policies that are used day to day).
 Data processors. Data processors are the users who read and edit the data regularly. Users must clearly
understand their responsibilities with data based on its classification. Can they share it? What happens if they
accidentally lose it or destroy it?
 Data remanence. Data remanence occurs when data is deleted but remains recoverable. Whenever you delete a
file, the operating system marks the space the file took up as available. But the data is still there, and with freely
downloadable tools, you can easily extract that data. Organizations need to account for data remanence to ensure
they are protecting their data. There are a few options:
 Secure deletion or overwriting of data. You can use a tool to overwrite the space that a file was using
with random 1s and 0s, either in one pass or in multiple passes. The more passes you use, the less likely it
is that the data can be recovered.
 Destroying the media. You can shred disk drives, smash them into tiny pieces, or use other means to
physically destroy them. This is effective but renders the media unusable thereafter.
 Degaussing. Degaussing relies on the removal or reduction of magnetic fields on the disk drives. It is very
effective and complies with many government requirements for data remanence.
24
 Collection limitation. Security often focuses on protecting the data you already have. But part of data protection
is limiting how much data your organization collects. For example, if you collect users’ birthdates or identification
card numbers, you then must protect that data. If your organization doesn’t need the data, it shouldn’t collect it.
Many countries are enacting laws and regulations to limit the collection of data. But many organizations are
unaware and continue to collect vast amounts of sensitive data. You should have a privacy policy that specifies
what information is collected, how it is used and other pertinent details.
2.4 Ensure appropriate asset retention
There are two aspects to data retention: You should ensure that your organization holds data for as long as required —
and also that it securely deletes data that is no longer required, in order to reduce the risk of its exposure.
To determine how long to keep certain data, you need to consider both whether the data is still useful to your organization
and whether there are any regulations, legal reasons or company policies requiring its retention. In many cases, a company
must keep data for longer than the data provides value; for example, your organization might have a policy to retain email
data for 7 years regardless of its value. As part of your comprehensive security policies, you should ensure the destruction
of unneeded data.
Besides data, this section also covers the hardware and personnel required to use the data. These are quite important.
 Hardware. Even if you maintain data for the appropriate retention period, it won’t do you any good if you don’t
have hardware that can read the data. For example, if you have data on backup tapes and hold them for 10 years,
you run the risk of not being able to read the tapes toward the end of the retention period because tape hardware
changes every few years. Thus, you must ensure you have the hardware and related software (tape drives, media
readers and so on) needed to get to the data that you are saving.
 Personnel. Suppose your company is retaining data for the required time periods and maintaining hardware to
read the data. But what happens if the only person who knew how to operate your tape drives and restore data
from them no longer works at the company, and the new team is only familiar with disk-to-disk backup? You might
not be able to get to your data! By documenting all the procedures and architecture, you can minimize this risk.
2.5 Determine data security controls
You need data security controls that protect your data as it is stored, used and transmitted.
 Understanding data states. The industry identifies three data states:
 Data at rest is data stored on a storage medium (disk, tape, etc.).
 Data in motion is data moving from a source (such as a computer) to a destination (such as another
computer).
 Data in use is data that is actively being worked on (for example, a person editing a spreadsheet).
 Scoping and tailoring. Scoping is the process of finalizing which controls are in scope and which are out of scope
(not applicable). Tailoring is the process of customizing the implementation of controls for an organization.
25
 Standards selection. Standards selection is the process by which organizations plan, choose and document
technologies and/or architectures for implementation. For example, you might evaluate three vendors for an edge
firewall solution. You could use a standards selection process to help determine which solution best fits the
organization. Vendor selection is closely related to standards selection but focuses on the vendors, not the
technologies or solutions. The overall goal is to have an objective and measurable selection process. If you repeat
the process with a totally different team, then they should come up with the same selection as the first team. In
such a scenario, you would know that your selection process is working as expected.
 Data protection methods. The options for protecting data depend on its state:
 Data at rest. You can encrypt data at rest. You should consider encryption for operating system volumes
and data volumes, and you should encrypt backups, too. Be sure to consider all locations for data at rest,
such as tapes, USB drives, external drives, RAID arrays, SAN, NAS and optical media.
 Data in motion. Data is in motion when it is being transferred from one place to another. Sometimes, it is
moving from your local area network to the internet, but it can also be internal to your network, such as
from a server to a client computer. You can encrypt data in motion to protect it. For example, a web server
uses a certificate to encrypt data being viewed by a user, and you can use IPsec to encrypt communications.
There are many options. The most important point is to use encryption whenever possible, including for
internal-only web sites available only to workers connected to your local area network.
 Data in use. Data in use is often in memory because it is being used by, say, a developer working on some
code updates or a user running reports on company sales. The data must be available to the relevant
applications and operating system functions. There are some third-party solutions for encrypting data in
memory, but the selection is limited. In addition to keeping the latest patches deployed to all computing
devices, maintaining a standard computer build process, and running anti-virus and anti-malware software,
organizations often use strong authentication, monitoring and logging to protect data in use.
2.6 Establish information and asset handling requirements
This section covers how people and systems work with data. This includes any action you can take with the data, such as
read, copy, edit or delete. The key subtopics are important to know:
 Markings and labels. You should mark data to ensure that users are following the proper handling requirements.
The data could be printouts or media like disks or backup tapes. For example, if your employee review process is
on paper, the documents should be labeled as sensitive, so that anyone who stumbles across them accidentally
will know not to read them but turn them over to the data owner or a member of the management or security
team. You also might restrict the movement of confidential data, such as backup tapes, to certain personnel or to
certain areas of your facility. Without labels, the backup tapes might not be handled in accordance with company
requirements.
 Storage. You can store data in many ways, including on paper, disk or tape. For each scenario, you must define the
acceptable storage locations and inform users about those locations. It is common to provide a vault or safe for
backup tapes stored on premises, for example. Personnel who deal with sensitive papers should have a locked
26
cabinet or similar secure storage for those documents. Users should have a place to securely store files, such as
an encrypted volume or an encrypted shared folder.
 Destruction. Your organization should have a policy for destruction of sensitive data. The policy should cover all
the mediums that your organization uses for storing data — paper, disk, tape, etc. Some data classifications, such
as those that deal with sensitive or confidential information, should require the most secure form of data
destruction, such as physical destruction or secure data deletion with multiple overwrite passes. Other
classifications might require only a single overwrite pass. The most important thing is to document the requirement
for the various forms of media and the classification levels. When in doubt, destroy data as though it were classified
as the most sensitive data at your organization.
