### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the repository's issues and am confident that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
The controlled/uncontrolled behavior of the component should be determined at the time of mounting.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, the controlled/uncontrolled behavior is being determined at each render, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.

#### Steps to Reproduce
- Examine the source code of the `Input` component.

#### Context
This issue was initially raised by @kgregory in [#9523](#9523). It is important to note that the `Input` component is the only one exhibiting this behavior. Other components such as `input`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `Radio`, `ExpansionPanel`, and `Tooltip` do not exhibit this issue.

#### Environment
- **Material-UI:** v1.0.0-beta.24
- **React:** v16.2.0
