## Expected Behavior
The controlled/uncontrolled behavior is determined at the mount time.
## Current Behavior
The controlled/uncontrolled behavior is determined at each render.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Look at the source code.
## Context
@kgregory Raised this issue in #9523. It's important to notice that the
`Input` component is the only component behaving this way. It's no the case
for: `input`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `Radio`, `ExpansionPanel` and `Tooltip`.
