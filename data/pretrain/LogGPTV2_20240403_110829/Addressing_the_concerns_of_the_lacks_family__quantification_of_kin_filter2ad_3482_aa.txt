ABSTRACT
The rapid progress in human-genome sequencing is leading
to a high availability of genomic data. This data is noto-
riously very sensitive and stable in time. It is also highly
correlated among relatives. A growing number of genomes
are becoming accessible online (e.g., because of leakage, or
after their posting on genome-sharing websites). What are
then the implications for kin genomic privacy? We formal-
ize the problem and detail an eﬃcient reconstruction attack
based on graphical models and belief propagation. With this
approach, an attacker can infer the genomes of the relatives
of an individual whose genome is observed, relying notably
on Mendel’s Laws and statistical relationships between the
nucleotides (on the DNA sequence). Then, to quantify the
level of genomic privacy as a result of the proposed infer-
ence attack, we discuss possible deﬁnitions of genomic pri-
vacy metrics. Genomic data reveals Mendelian diseases and
the likelihood of developing degenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s. We also introduce the quantiﬁcation of health
privacy, speciﬁcally the measure of how well the predisposi-
tion to a disease is concealed from an attacker. We evaluate
our approach on actual genomic data from a pedigree and
show the threat extent by combining data gathered from a
genome-sharing website and from an online social network.

INTRODUCTION
With the help of rapidly developing technology, DNA se-
quencing is becoming less expensive. As a consequence, the
research in genomics has gained speed in paving the way to
personalized (genomic) medicine, and geneticists need large
collections of human genomes to further increase this speed.
Furthermore, individuals are using their genomes to learn
about their (genetic) predispositions to diseases, their ances-
tries, and even their (genetic) compatibilities with potential
partners. This trend has also caused the launch of health-
related websites and online social networks (OSNs), in which
individuals share their genomic data (e.g., OpenSNP [1] or
23andMe [2]). Thus, already today, thousands of genomes
are available online.
Even though most of the genomes on the Internet are
anonymized, it is possible to ﬁnd genomes with the iden-
tiﬁers of their owners (e.g., OpenSNP [1]). Furthermore, it
has been shown that anonymization is not suﬃcient for pro-
tecting the real identities of the genome donors [29,47]. Once
the owner of a genome is identiﬁed, he is faced with the risk
of discrimination (e.g., by employers or insurance compa-
nies) [9]. Some believe that they have nothing to hide about
their genetic structure, hence they might decide to give full
consent for the publication of their genomes on the Inter-
net to help genomic research. However, our DNA sequences
are highly correlated to our relatives’ sequences. The DNA
sequences between two random human beings are 99.9% sim-
ilar, and this value is even higher for closely related people.
Consequently, somebody revealing his genome does not only
damage his own genomic privacy, but also puts his relatives’
privacy at risk [46]. Moreover, currently, a person does not
need consent from his relatives to share his genome online.
This is precisely where the interesting part of the story be-
gins: kin genomic privacy.
A recent New York Times’ article [3] reports the contro-
versy about sequencing and publishing, without the permis-
sion of her family, the genome of Henrietta Lacks (who died
in 1951). On the one hand, the family members think that
her genome is private family information and it should not
be published without the consent of the family. On the
other hand, some scientists argued that the genomes of cur-
rent family members have changed so much over time (due
to gene mixing during reproduction), that nothing accurate
could be told about the genomes of current family members
by using Henrietta Lacks’ genome. As we will also show in
this work, they are wrong. Minutes after Henrietta Lacks’
genome was uploaded to a public website called SNPedia,
researchers produced a report full of personal information
1141about Henrietta Lacks. Later, the genome was taken oﬄine,
but it had already been downloaded by several people, hence
both her and (partially) the Lacks family’s genomic privacy
was already lost.
Unfortunately, the Lacks, even though possibly the most
publicized family facing this problem, are not the only fam-
ily facing this threat. As we mentioned before, the genomes
of thousands of individuals are available online. Once the
identity of a genome donor is known, an attacker can learn
about his relatives (or his family tree) by using an auxiliary
side channel, such as an OSN, and infer signiﬁcant informa-
tion about the DNA sequences of the donor’s relatives. We
will show the feasibility of such an attack and evaluate the
privacy risks by using publicly available data on the Web.
Although the researchers took Henrietta Lacks’ genome
oﬄine from SNPedia, other databases continue to publish
portions of her genomic data. Publishing only portions of
a genome does not, however, completely hide the unpub-
lished portions; even if a person reveals only a part of his
genome, other parts can be inferred using the statistical rela-
tionships between the nucleotides in his DNA. For example,
James Watson, co-discoverer of DNA, made his whole DNA
sequence publicly available, with the exception of one gene
known as Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), one of the strongest
predictors for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. How-
ever, later it was shown that the correlation (called link-
age disequilibrium by geneticists) between one or multiple
polymorphisms and ApoE can be used to predict the ApoE
status [40]. Thus, an attacker can also use these statisti-
cal relationships (which are publicly available) to infer the
DNA sequences of a donor’s family members, even if the
donor shares only part of his genome.
It is important to
note that these privacy threats not only jeopardize kin ge-
nomic privacy, but, if not properly addressed, these issues
could also hamper genomic research due to untimely fear of
potential misuse of genomic information.
In this work, we evaluate the genomic privacy of an indi-
vidual threatened by his relatives revealing their genomes.
Focusing on the most common genetic variant in human pop-
ulation, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and con-
sidering the statistical relationships between the SNPs on
the DNA sequence, we quantify the loss in genomic privacy
of individuals when one or more of their family members’
genomes are (either partially or fully) revealed. To achieve
this goal, ﬁrst, we design a reconstruction attack based on
a well-known statistical inference technique. The computa-
tional complexity of the traditional ways of realizing such in-
ference grows exponentially with the number of SNPs (which
is on the order of tens of millions) and relatives. Therefore,
in order to infer the values of the unknown SNPs in linear
complexity, we represent the SNPs, family relationships and
the statistical relationships between SNPs on a factor graph
and use the belief propagation algorithm [37, 41] for infer-
ence. Then, using various metrics, we quantify the genomic
privacy of individuals and show the decrease in their level of
genomic privacy caused by the published genomes of their
family members. We also quantify the health privacy of the
individuals by considering their (genetic) predisposition to
certain serious diseases. We evaluate the proposed inference
attack and show its eﬃciency and accuracy by using real
genomic data of a pedigree. More importantly, by using ge-
nomic data and pedigree information we collected from a
public genome-sharing website and an OSN, we show that
the proposed inference attack threatens not only the Lacks
family, but also many other families.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we give a brief background on genomics and belief propaga-
tion. In Section 3, we present the proposed framework in
detail. In Section 4, we evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed inference attack using diﬀerent metrics. In Section 5,
we show how the proposed inference attack threatens the ge-
nomic and health privacy of several families gathered from
OSNs. In Section 6, we summarize the related work on ge-
netic inference and genomic-privacy protection. Finally, we
conclude the paper in Section 7.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce the relevant genetic
principles, as well as the concept of belief propagation.
2.1 Genomics 101
DNA is a double-helix structure that consists of two com-
plementary polymer chains. Genetic information is encoded
on the DNA as a sequence of nucleotides (A,T,G,C) and
a human DNA includes around 3 billion nucleotide pairs.
With the decreasing cost of DNA sequencing, genomic data
is currently being used mainly in the following two areas:
(i) clinical diagnostics, for personalized genomic medicine
and genetic research (e.g., genome-wide association stud-
ies1), and (ii) direct-to-consumer genomics, for genetic risk
estimation of various diseases or for recreational activities
such as ancestry search. In the following, we brieﬂy intro-
duce some concepts, which we use throughout this paper,
about the human genome and reproduction.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
2.1.1
As already mentioned, human beings have 99.9% of their
DNA in common. Thus, there is no need to focus on the
whole DNA but rather on the most important variants. Sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common
DNA variation in human population. A SNP occurs when
a nucleotide (at a speciﬁc position on the DNA) varies be-
tween individuals of a given population (as illustrated in
Fig. 1). There are approximately 50 million SNP positions
in human population [4]. Recent discoveries show that the
susceptibility of an individual to several diseases can be com-
puted from his SNPs [5, 33]. For example, it has been re-
ported that two particular SNPs (rs7412 and rs429358) on
the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene indicate an (increased)
risk for Alzheimer’s disease. SNPs carry privacy-sensitive
information about individuals’ health, hence we will quan-
tify health privacy focusing on individuals’ published (or
inferred) SNPs and the diseases they reveal.
In general, two diﬀerent nucleotides (called alleles) are
observed at a given SNP position: (i) the major allele is
the most frequently observed nucleotide, and (ii) the minor
allele is the rare nucleotide.2 From here on, we represent the
major allele as B for a SNP position, and the minor allele
as b (where both B and b are in {A, T, G, C}).
Furthermore, each SNP position contains two nucleotides
(one inherited from the mother and one from the father, as
we will discuss next). Thus, the content of a SNP position
1Examination of many genetic variants in diﬀerent individ-
uals to determine if any variant is associated with a trait.
2The two alleles for the SNP position in Fig. 1 are C and T.

can be in one of the following states: (i) BB (homozygous-
major genotype), if an individual receives the same major
allele from both parents; (ii) Bb (heterozygous genotype),
if he receives a diﬀerent allele from each parent (one minor
and one major); or (iii) bb (homozygous-minor genotype),
if he inherits the same minor allele from both parents. We
represent the content of a SNP position as xi
j for SNP j
j ∈ {BB, Bb, bb}. For simplicity
at individual i, where xi
of presentation, in the rest of the paper, we denote BB as
j ∈ {0, 1, 2}). Finally, each
0, Bb as 1, and bb as 2 (i.e., xi
SNP i is assigned a minor allele frequency (MAF), pb
i , which
represents the frequency at which the minor allele (b) of the
corresponding SNP occurs in a given population (typically,
0 < pb
i < 0.5).
2.1.2 Reproduction
Mendel’s First Law states that alleles are passed indepen-
dently from parents to children for diﬀerent meioses (the
process of cell division necessary for reproduction). For each
SNP position, a child inherits one allele from his mother and
one from his father. Each allele of a parent is inherited by
a child with equal probability of 0.5. Let FR(xM
j , xC
j )
be the function modeling the Mendelian inheritance for a
SNP j, where (M, F, C) represent mother, father, and child,
respectively. We illustrate the Mendelian inheritance prob-
abilities for a SNP j in Table 1.
j , xF
Based on FR(xM
j ), we can say that, given both
parents’ genomes, a child’s genome is conditionally indepen-
dent of all other ancestors’ genomes.

2.1.3 Linkage Disequilibrium
As we discussed before, DNA sequences are highly corre-
lated, leading to interdependent privacy risks. Linkage dis-
equilibrium (LD) [24] is a correlation that appears between
