word. If we consider only recall attempts where participants made
no mistakes (correctly entered their password on the ﬁrst attempt),
then the difference in entry time is not signiﬁcant. In other words,
during both the Login and Recall-1 steps of Session 1, participants
entered PassPoints passwords at least as quickly, or more quickly,
than text passwords.
Recall-2. There is no signiﬁcant difference in the total amount
of time taken by participants in the Text and PassPoints conditions
in Recall-2. However, if we consider only those participants who
were successful on their ﬁrst attempt, then Text participants were
quicker at entering these successful passwords.
4.4 Use of Mnemonics
When faced with the task of remembering multiple items, people
naturally turn to memory aids, or mnemonics. In our study, partic-
ipants in the PassPoints condition had a built-in mnemonic since
they could use the image as a memory aid. We gave no instructions

to participants in either condition as to what they could use as mem-
ory aids. No user tried to write down their passwords. The accounts
were identiﬁed by banners just above the username and password
entry ﬁelds (see Figures 8 and 9). We investigated whether various
account characteristics, such as account names, types, or banners,
were used as mnemonics.
We manually classiﬁed the passwords in the Text condition ac-
cording to whether they were related to their account. We found
that 23 out of 34 (68%) participants in the Text condition used
the account as a cue for at least one of their passwords. Some
passwords were directly linked with the account name. For ex-
ample, one user entered “instantmsg” for the instant messenger

account. Others were somewhat related, such as “lovelove” for
the online dating account. In total, 40% of text passwords were
related to their account. Other passwords appeared to be in lan-
guages we did not understand and may have corresponded to their
accounts, but we did not count these in our totals. We observed gen-
der differences in the use of mnemonics, with males being more
likely to create passwords that were directly related to their ac-
counts (t(32) = 2.07, p < .05).
We found no apparent link between passwords created in the
PassPoints condition and their associated accounts. Possible expla-
nations include that participants in the PassPoints condition either
did not need an additional mnemonic device since they could al-
ready use the password image, were unable to ﬁnd a way to use the
account characteristics as memory aids for this type of password,
or did so in a manner that was not apparent to us.
Recall-1. Since the use of mnemonics only applies to text pass-
words, we compared success rates for participants who used account-
related passwords and those that did not for the Text condition. Par-
ticipants classiﬁed as having used account-related text passwords
had a 96% success rate for Recall-1 while those who did not had
an 83% recall success rate (χ2(1,204)=8.68, p < .01). The use
of account-related passwords made it signiﬁcantly easier for Text
participants to recall their passwords during Session 1.
Recall-2. Similarly, we examined whether the use of account-
related passwords affected the Recall-2 success rates for the Text
condition. Those classiﬁed as having created account-related pass-
words had a 71% success rate for Recall-2, while those who did
not had a 69% success rate. A Chi-square (χ2) test shows that this
difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. Participants who created
account-related passwords were no more likely to remember their
passwords after two weeks. In our study, creating account-based
text passwords helped with memorability in the short term, but it
did not provide an advantage after two weeks.
4.5 Patterns
We further evaluated whether participants were more likely to
use a coping strategy, such as selecting predictable passwords, when
faced with the task of creating and remembering several passwords.
4.5.1 Text Password Patterns
We visually inspected all of the passwords created in the Text
condition to see if a given user created similar passwords for all 6
of his or her accounts. Although they may help with memorabil-
ity, patterns across accounts are a security vulnerability because an
attacker who learns a user’s password for one (perhaps weakly pro-
tected) account may be able to more easily guess passwords for the
user’s other (perhaps more important) accounts.
We found that 18 out of 34 participants (53%) in the Text con-
dition created at least one pair of passwords that were similar to
each other. In total, 71 out of 204 passwords (35%) were obviously
related to other passwords created by the same user. An example
of such a pair included: “ins901333” for the instant messenger ac-
count and “lib901333” for the library account.
In this case, the
passwords followed a pattern across passwords and were also di-
rectly related to the corresponding accounts. This particular user
applied this strategy to all 6 passwords.
4.5.2 PassPoints Patterns
We examined whether the PassPoints passwords followed sim-
ple patterns, based on previous work on click-based graphical pass-
words [8] which classiﬁed the types of patterns created by the click-
points of user-chosen passwords. The earlier study found that in
PassPoints, participants were likely to select click-points in simple
patterns such as a straight line or C- shape.
We tested the passwords from the current study for patterns, con-
cerned that participants may be even more likely to resort to com-
mon patterns if they had several passwords to remember. A com-
parison of the types of patterns found in the current study and those
from the previous PassPoints study [6] is provided in Figure 11.
We found no statistical difference between the patterns found in the
current study (where participants had to create and remember mul-
tiple passwords) and the earlier PassPoints lab study (where partic-
ipants had to remember only one password at a time). So although
we did see patterns, we have no evidence that they occur more fre-
quently than when participants had only one graphical password to
remember. It appears that contrary to text passwords, participants
do not resort to these types of patterns as an additional coping strat-
egy for handling multiple click-based graphical passwords.
We also examined each user’s 6 passwords to see if anyone con-
sistently picked passwords in a given pattern. Two participants had
4 out of 6 passwords following a “Z” pattern, but no other partic-
ipants used a speciﬁc pattern for the majority of their passwords.
It is possible that with additional experience with PassPoints pass-
words, users might develop different password selection strategies.
4.6 Other Security Measures
Rather than revisit known security issues (for example, see the
PassPoints discussion in Section 2), in this section we are inter-
ested in exploring whether the requirement of remembering multi-
ple passwords exacerbates these security issues.
4.6.1 Text Password Dictionary Attack
We tested whether the text passwords collected in this study were
weaker than those created when participants only had to remember
one password at a time, with respect to a dictionary attack using
John the Ripper [12]. This open-source software tool uses a sup-
plied dictionary to systematically try to guess passwords. We ﬁrst
tested passwords using the free dictionary of 4 million entries, fol-
lowed by a second attack using a larger dictionary of 40 million
entries purchased from the John the Ripper web site.
507Figure 11: Patterns [8] formed by the click-points of user pass-
words when connecting all 5 click-points of a password in se-
quence from the ﬁrst to the last click-point. PPLab represents
an earlier PassPoints lab study [6,8] where participants remem-
bered only one password at a time. MPP represents the cur-
rent study where participants remembered multiple PassPoints
passwords. The differences between the two pattern sets are
not statistically signiﬁcant.
The smaller dictionary cracked 9.8% (20 out of 204) of pass-
words, while the larger dictionary identiﬁed 15.2% (31 out of 204)
of passwords. These are lower success rates than we expected since
a visual inspection of the passwords revealed that many passwords
were quite simple. Examples of passwords that were not cracked
by John the Ripper include: “msnhotmail” for an email password,
“instantmsg” for an instant messenger account, and “inlibrary” for
a library account. In an earlier study of text passwords [16], 9.5%
(18 out of 190) of passwords were cracked using John the Ripper
with the same 4 million entry dictionary and 18.9% (36 out of 190)
of passwords with the larger dictionary.
Participants in the current multiple password study often selected
their passwords with some association to the account or with some
pattern across passwords. The default John the Ripper dictionaries
do not take into account these characteristics. It would seem rel-
atively simple, however, for an attacker to modify the dictionaries
to target speciﬁc types of accounts. For example, for an attack on
bank passwords, attackers could modify the dictionary to include
more ﬁnancial terminology or terms associated with a particular
bank.
4.6.2 PassPoints Hotspot Formation
To evaluate PassPoints passwords for predictability, we com-
pared the distribution of click-points in the current study to those of
an earlier PassPoints study on the same images [6]. We wanted to
see whether there was increased clustering of click-points across
participants. Clustering occurs when several participants select
click-points in the same areas of the image. It is problematic be-
cause it signals that there are hotspots: areas of the image where
participants are more likely to select click-points. Attackers can
gather a small sample of passwords and use this information to pre-
dict hotspots and thus guess likely passwords [33]. In the current
study, if participants were compensating for having to remember
multiple passwords, they may opt to select more “obvious” (and
hence likely more memorable) click-points than they would other-
wise. We might therefore expect to see more clustering of click-
points in the current study than in the earlier PassPoints lab study
(where participants only had to remember one password at a time,
never revisiting previous images later in the study).
We used spatial statistics to evaluate whether participants who
had multiple PassPoints passwords were more likely to select click-
Figure 12: J-statistic at a radius of 9 pixels for the 6 images
used in the PassPoints condition. Participants in this study
(MPP) were no more likely to select click-points that clustered
than participants who only had to recall one password at a time
(PPLab).
points in common areas of the image. Spatial statistics are used
in areas such as Earth Sciences to evaluate the spatial distribution
of a dataset. The J-function [35] measures the level of clustering
of points within a dataset. It combines nearest-neighbour calcula-
tions with empty space measures for a given radius to measure the
clustering of points at that radius. We applied the J-function to the
dataset of click-points selected by the 32 PassPoints participants for
each image in this study (160 click-points per image). The earlier
PassPoints datasets [6] contained between 155 to 220 click-points
per image. We used a radius of 9 pixels to approximate the size
of the tolerance area (19x19 pixels) used to determine whether a
click-point was correct during password re-entry.
