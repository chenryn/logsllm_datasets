  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Components with withStyles should work with recursively.
## Current Behavior
Cannot find classes of jss.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. I m trying to build a nested menu recursively. Every menu element is a component with withStyles.
  2. Component ul in the component ul can't get the classes of the Jss.
  3. This is an example menu data,
    [
      {
        "type": "ul",
        "title": "ul - Level 1",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "ul",
            "title": "ul - level 2",
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "li",
                "title": "li - Level 3"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "type": "li",
            "title": "li - Level 2"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "li",
        "title": "li - Level 1"
      }
    ]
  4. Checkout the demonstration of the issue; there is also working version without withStyles.
