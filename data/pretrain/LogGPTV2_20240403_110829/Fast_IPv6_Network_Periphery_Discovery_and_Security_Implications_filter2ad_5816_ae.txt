different vendors’ peripheries in practice and the IPv6 network
security policy and posture disparity. In any case, the existence
of device services accessible by outer undesired users means
the security audits and policies are not adequate and appropri-
95
ate. This also calls on the device vendors to build their devices
paying more attention to the IPv6 security protection and the
users to operate their routers with more cautions. Otherwise,
such devices and services can be exposed quickly, and related
vulnerabilities could be leveraged stealthily.
VI. ROUTING LOOP ATTACK
In this section, we ﬁnd a widespread implementation defect
of the IPv6 packet routing and forwarding strategy, which can
result in routing inconsistencies between the ISP routers’ and
the CPE routers’ IPv6 routing state. Attackers can exploit this
kind of inconsistency to conduct trafﬁc forwarding loop attacks
between the ISP routers and the home routers with an ampliﬁ-
cation factor of >200. With the ability to mount fast periphery
scanning, ﬁrst, we carry out a comprehensive measurement to
show how widely this routing loop is distributed in the world.
Second, based on discovered peripheries, although as a sample,
we investigate how many devices and vendors are vulnerable
to the routing loop attack. Our results show that 5.8M routers
from at least 49 device vendors distributing in 3.8k ASes and
132 countries are affected by this routing loop attack.
A. Threat Model of Routing Loop Attacks
As Section II and Section III-A describe, the ISPs tend to
delegate or assign large IPv6 sub-preﬁxes (such as /60 and /56)
to their subscribers, which shifts the preﬁx management tasks
from the ISP routers to the CPE routers, requiring careful and
correct operations. However, due to the new address allocation
principles and empirical practices from IPv4 networks, several
vendors implement the CPE routers’ IPv6 packet routing mod-
ules incorrectly, resulting in the trafﬁc routing loop attacks.
As shown in Figure 4, the ISP router P (IPv6p) assigns the
WAN Preﬁx and delegates a LAN Preﬁx to the CPE router R
(IPv6r) and dispose the next-hop with the CPE’s WAN Address.
The CPE router assigns one Subnet Preﬁx to its LAN network
and set the next-hop of it to LAN devices, setting the Not-used
Preﬁxes to default the next-hop IPv6p (lacking an unreachable
route). Attackers exploit this by crafting a packet routed to an

address within the Not-used Preﬁx that is not used in the LAN
network, e.g., 2001:db8:4321:8769::/64. In that routing state,
the ISP router forwards the packet to the CPE router, whereas
the CPE router forwards it back to the ISP router. As a result,
such a packet’s forwarding brings about trafﬁc loops in the link
between both routers. These two routers and the link between
them become victims of the loop. Similarly, some CPE routers
just add a route for its WAN Address within the WAN Preﬁx and
leave the remaining addresses (NX Address) to be matched by
the default route when forwarding, inducing the loop as well.
In practice, any routing inconsistency between the upstream
router and the downstream router could cause a trafﬁc forward-
ing loop both in the IPv4 and IPv6 networks. However, due to
the sizeable IPv6 preﬁx, such a loop is more typical for IPv6.
A forwarding loop terminates when the Hop Limit ﬁeld in
the IPv6 header is zeroed out, called Time-exceeded [24]. This
ﬁeld’s maximum value is 255. We assume the hop count prior
to the ISP router is n, and the remaining count is 255-n. Each
packet will traverse both routers (255-n)/2 times. So, the loop
can be used to amplify trafﬁcs with a ratio of 255-n. Notably, a
previous study shows that not every AS adopts source address
ﬁltering mechanism [55], which means that by faking source
IPv6 address, we can force the response packet to be forwarded
to the Not-used Preﬁx as well, doubling the loop times.
B. Measurement Methodology
To measure the affected population and extent of the vulner-
able devices, we use XMap to locate the routing loop devices.
Method. Suppose that we discover a packet forwarding loop,
we can deduce something is wrong with the target router. Ac-
cordingly, if a device replies with an ICMPv6 Time-exceeded
message just in response to a crafted ping packet with a large
Hop Limit h described in Section VI-A, we send the same
crafted packet again but using a Hop Limit h+2. If a Time-
exceeded packet comes from the same device once again, we
conclude the device is vulnerable to the routing loop weakness.
However, a large Hop Limit will potentially result in many
routing loop packets, which overwhelm the target device and

network. In contrast, a small Hop Limit will cause the missing
of vulnerable devices and lead to false results. Thus, a proper
Hop Limit must be selected to balance accuracy and negative
impact. In [15], Beverly et al. probed the CAIDA target dataset
(BGP-advertised IPv6 preﬁxes) on May 2, 2018, to evaluate
Yarrp6’s ﬁll mode. They showed that when the Hop Limit was
set to 32, the ﬁll mode produced no additional probes, which
means that the hop count between their vantage points and all
the target addresses is <32. Besides, we perform a small and
similar test on the dataset from [76] and gain the same results.
Accordingly, we adjust the probing Hop Limit h to 32 for the
fact that the hop count between two addresses is commonly
<32 on the Internet to reduce the routing loop impact.
Furthermore, we utilize the MAC address (from the EUI-64
address [45]) and the application-level information (HTTP/80,
8080) to extrapolate the device vendors, and use the MaxMind
IP geolocation database [57] to identify the AS and country.
Probing. Above all things, to ﬁgure out how widely such loops
exist, we contrive a probing test for all globally advertised IPv6
BGP preﬁxes gathered from the BGP system Routeviews [76].
We scan the successive 16-bit sub-preﬁx space for each preﬁx.
For example, for BGP preﬁx 2001:db8::/32, we use XMap to
probe every /48 sub-preﬁxes (from the 32nd to 48th bit) with
random IID. Moreover, we carry out a depth-ﬁrst experiment
on the sample blocks (32-bit sub-preﬁx space) in Table II, to
see how many devices and vendors are affected by the loop.
We take the same experiment setup from Section IV-E. Be-
sides, we follow the ethical recommendations in Section IV-D.
C. Methodology Results
Vulnerable ASN and Country. The scanning of all IPv6 BGP
advertised preﬁxes brings out ∼4M unique last hop addresses
involving 6,911 ASes and 170 countries (Table IX). ∼128k
last hops from 3,877 ASes and 132 countries are vulnerable to
the routing loop weakness, and the IID distribution results are
listed in Table X. Excepting devices with randomized and EUI-
64 address (64.7%, which tend to be peripheries as shown in
Section IV-E), devices with low-byte, byte-pattern, and embed-
IPv4 address (which are often conﬁgured manually) show the
same routing loop behaviors in our measurement. We suppose
that the loops on those routers result from the manual route
misconﬁguration or by script, and we have contacted the AS
administrators to conﬁrm our results. Figure 5 summarizes the
Top 10 ASes and countries that produce the largest number of
routing loop devices from the IPv6 BGP preﬁxes scanning.

Vulnerable Router and Vendor. Targeting towards 15 sample
IPv6 blocks, we discover 5.79M unique peripheries with the
routing loop vulnerability within 5.62M different /64 preﬁxes.
95.1% of the last hops forward the loop packet due to incorrect
routes of LAN Preﬁx (as seen in the “diff” column), while 4.9%
of the peripheries mistake the WAN Preﬁx routes (listed in the
“same” column). Among them, 3.22M devices are identiﬁed as
peripheries, such as home routers, which come from 49 router
vendors affected by the loop vulnerability. The 5 most frequent
vendors and ASes are shown in Figure 6, including the (total)
device number within each device vendor and AS. Owing to
the biased target IPv6 preﬁx, the primarily vulnerable vendors
come from China, such as China Mobile [59] and ZTE [93].
However, several devices from Netgear [64], Linksys [52],
Tenda [82], MikroTik [58], Optilink [67], Xiaomi [90], and
Totolink [85] are vulnerable to the loop as well.
D. Case Study
To study the real loop behaviors and the impact, we analyze
95 sample home routers from 20 well-known router vendors
and 4 open-source routing OSes installed in VMware platform,
which are all updated to their up-to-date ﬁrmware by Dec 1st,
2020 and linked to a broadband home network. The WAN is
assigned a /64 preﬁx, and the LAN is delegated a /60 preﬁx.
Testing Results. For each router, we send one crafted packet
with Hop Limit 255 to a destination from the Not-used Preﬁx
within its WAN Preﬁx and LAN Preﬁx respectively. Then we
observe their routing tables and trafﬁcs to decide whether the
routing loop exists or not and the loop times. Their vulnerable
behaviors of partial routers and affected device numbers are
listed in Table XII. Conforming with our scanning results, all
