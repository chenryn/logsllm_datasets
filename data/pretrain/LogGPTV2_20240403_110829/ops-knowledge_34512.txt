User: Please provide an effective containerization solution, including container deployment and orchestration, container monitoring and log management, and container network settings.
Assistant: Containerization solution: 1. Container deployment and orchestration method: use Kubernetes as a container orchestration tool, and create a container image based on Docker; 2. Container monitoring and log management: use Prometheus and Grafana as monitoring tools, and install Node Exporter, Components such as cAdvisor provide container system-level indicator data, combined with PromQL language to write rules and panel display, and use EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) as a log management solution to collect container log data through Fluentd and store it in Elasticsearch. Kibana performs visual display and query of logs, etc.; 3. Container network settings: use Flannel as the network solution between containers. By creating a virtual network layer, each node will be assigned a unique IP network segment, and use VXLAN encapsulation and decapsulation At the same time, service discovery and load balancing for containers can be achieved using service mesh tools such as Istio. The entire containerization solution can be combined with an automated construction platform, such as Jenkins or GitLab, to realize automatic construction, push, and deployment of container images through continuous integration and continuous deployment of projects.
