### Optimized Text

I indexed two documents using the following commands:

```bash
curl -XPUT http://192.168.0.118:9200/test/company/apple -d '{"data":"Apple corp"}'
curl -XPUT http://192.168.0.118:9200/test/fruit/apple -d '{"data":"Just red apple"}'
```

In this example, we have a `test` index with two documents, both having the ID `"apple"`, but they are of different types: one is of type `company` and the other is of type `fruit`.

When I perform a multi-get request to retrieve these documents:

```bash
curl -XGET http://192.168.0.118:9200/test/_mget?pretty -d '{"ids":["apple","apple"]}'
```

The response is as follows:

```json
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_index": "test",
      "_type": "fruit",
      "_id": "apple",
      "_version": 1,
      "found": true,
      "_source": { "data": "Just red apple" }
    },
    {
      "_index": "test",
      "_type": "fruit",
      "_id": "apple",
      "_version": 1,
      "found": true,
      "_source": { "data": "Just red apple" }
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the documents are duplicated in the response. If I request more instances of the same ID, such as:

```bash
curl -XGET http://192.168.0.118:9200/test/_mget?pretty -d '{"ids":["apple","apple","apple"]}'
```

The result set will contain three identical documents.

### Suggested Solution

To address this issue, I recommend that the `ids` parameter should ignore duplicate identifiers. This would ensure that each unique document is returned only once, regardless of how many times its ID is specified in the `ids` array.
