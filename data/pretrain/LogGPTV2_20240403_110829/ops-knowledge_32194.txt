User: I removed python from my computer to be reinstalled. However after removing it, many services has gone from my Ubuntu 10.04. (e.g. mozilla, Ubuntu Software Center and many applications from System tab.) How can I get back all of them? Thanks a lot..
Assistant: Most of the code written in Ubuntu is written in Python. One should avoid removing system dependencies at any time.
You can do sudo apt-get install python but rest of the programs are probably gone; even though you install them manually, you can experience random bugs, system failures. I think you should just re-install ubuntu
