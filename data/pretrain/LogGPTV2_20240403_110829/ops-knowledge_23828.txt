User: Will google Go use less resources than Python and Java on Appengine? Are the instance startup times for go faster than Java's and Python's startup times? 
Is the go program uploaded as binaries or source code and if it is uploaded as source code is it then compiled once or at each instance startup?
In other words: Will I benefit from using Go in app engine from a cost perspective? (only taking to account the cost of the appengine resources not development time)
Assistant: I haven't used Go, but I would strongly suspect it would load and execute instances much faster, and use less memory purely because it is compiled. Anecdotally from the group, I believe that Python is more responsive than Java, at least in instance startup time. 
Instance load/startup times are important because when your instance is hit by more requests than it can handle, it spins up another instance. This makes that request take much longer, possibly giving the impression that the site is generally slow. Both Java and Python have to startup their virtual machine/interpreter, so I would expect Go to be an order of magnitude faster here.
There is one other issue - now Python2.7 is available, Go is the only option that is single-threaded (ironically, given that Go is designed as a modern multi-process language). So although Go requests should be handled faster, an instance can only handle requests serially. I'd be very surprised if this limitation last long, though.
