## Abstract

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the de facto inter-domain routing protocol, was designed without inherent security measures. Network operators have experienced frequent prefix hijacks, often due to BGP misconfigurations or malicious activities. To address this, prefix origin validation based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been proposed and developed. Many organizations are now registering their data in the RPKI to protect their prefixes from accidental misorigination. However, some organizations submit incorrect information to RPKI repositories or announce prefixes that do not match their registrations. Additionally, the RPKI repositories of Internet registries are not always operationally reliable. This study aims to identify and measure these issues, assess their impact, and explore potential solutions. We analyze the effects of a policy that discards route announcements with invalid origins on the routing table and, to a lesser extent, on the traffic at the edge of a large research network.

## 1. Introduction

Prefix misoriginations, where an Autonomous System (AS) announces an IP prefix to which it has no rights, are a recurring issue in the Internet. These can arise from BGP misconfigurations or malicious intent. A notable example is the "YouTube incident" in 2008, where Pakistan Telecom advertised one of YouTube's IPv4 prefixes, resulting in global traffic blackholing. Another example is the "Indosat event" in 2014, where Indosat originated over 400,000 prefixes, likely due to a misconfiguration. In August 2014, a bitcoin miner was attacked, with the goal of diverting traffic and computational results. These incidents highlight the limitations of route origin validation and the need for robust security measures.

In the current taxonomy, there are three key components to improving BGP security: the RPKI, RPKI-based origin validation, and future path validation. This paper focuses on RPKI and RPKI-based origin validation.

The RPKI is an X.509-based hierarchy aligned with the Internet IP address allocation system, managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). It provides the foundation for origin and path validation. Currently, all five RIRs—AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE—have deployed the RPKI.

RPKI-based origin validation uses RPKI data to verify that the AS originating an IP prefix is authorized to do so. While this does not provide cryptographic verification, as BGP update messages do not carry signatures, it should prevent most accidental hijackings. RPKI-based origin validation is supported by major router vendors such as Cisco and Juniper.

A Route Origination Authorization (ROA) is an RPKI object that asserts that a specified AS is authorized to originate BGP announcements for a given set of prefixes. A ROA includes an AS number, a list of IP prefixes, and a maximum length for each prefix, allowing the AS to advertise more specific prefixes up to the specified length.

Understanding the deployment status of route origin validation is crucial. We have been collecting data from the RPKI infrastructure since April 2012. Our analysis shows that ROA registration is well-deployed in Europe and Latin America but poorly deployed in North America, Asia/Pacific, and Africa. We also highlight operational challenges faced by RIRs in managing the RPKI infrastructure.

Operators have a strong incentive to register ROAs to protect their resources. For this to be effective, other operators must deploy route origin validation in their ASes. This protects customer traffic from following bogus routes and prevents routers from accepting excessive routes from a peer, which can lead to session resets or router restarts. It will also become a common best practice, similar to prefix filtering, to contain the effects of misconfigurations.

The second part of our study focuses on validating routes based on registered ROAs. We use data from public BGP monitors to study the evolution of route origin validity over a 2.5-year period. We also examine mismatches between RPKI-registered information and advertised routes to understand potential misunderstandings or tooling issues. We investigate whether the validity of a route depends on the location where the advertisement is received.

Among the invalid prefixes, 81% are covered by a valid prefix or a prefix not registered in the RPKI. A network operator strictly enforcing route-origin validation would not drop many prefixes. 54% of the invalid prefixes result from a mismatch between the prefix length and the MaxLength in the ROAs. Another significant issue arises from ISPs not helping multi-homed customers to register their sub-allocations.

Finally, we explore the traffic impact of performing route origin validation by analyzing statistics from an operational router in an American research network. The router counts traffic forwarded by routes with valid, not found, and invalid origins, providing insights into the potential impact of different BGP policies. Our findings suggest that if an operator configures its routers to strictly drop routes with invalid origins, the effect on traffic would be negligible.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Validation Process

To determine the validity of BGP route advertisements at a given point in time, we first collect all published ROAs and build a radix tree. Each ROA file contains an AS number, multiple IP prefixes, and a maximum length for each prefix. We extract tuples (ASN, Prefix, MaxLen, Expiration time) from validated ROA files and insert them into a radix tree, where each node is identified by an IP prefix. Multiple ROA records may exist for a particular prefix, so each node may contain more than one ROA record.

After building the radix tree, we validate the content of each BGP RIB dump. For each announcement in a RIB dump, we search for the longest prefix match in the radix tree. If no match is found, the announcement is marked as "ROA not found." We then check if the max length of the node covers the announced prefix and if the AS number in the ROA matches the origin AS number of the announcement. If these conditions are met, the ROA validates the route. If no validating ROA is found, we traverse upward in the tree to shorter prefixes until a matching ROA is found or no parent node exists. If no matching ROA is found, the route is marked as invalid; otherwise, its origin AS is deemed valid.

### 2.2 Datasets

This study relies on the following datasets:
1. ROAs downloaded from the RPKI infrastructure every hour from March 2012 to August 2014.
2. BGP RIB dumps from RouteViews available every two hours for the same period.
3. Marked statistics from a live router in a research network.

We primarily use LINX RIB dumps for validation and consider ISC, Sao Paulo, Sydney, and WIDE RouteViews monitors to determine the sensitivity of route origin validity at different locations.

For the first dataset, we chose trust anchors following the IETF SIDR working group recommendations, using the rcynic tool to download ROAs from RIPE, LACNIC, AfriNIC, APNIC, and CA0 trust anchors. Due to legal restrictions, ARIN data is only available from August 2014, and we include CA0 data, which is the trust anchor for some legacy and experimental address space.

We excluded BGP announcements with AS-SETs for the origin AS, as ROAs cannot cover AS-SETs. When validating the origins of advertisements in a RIB dump, we use the ROAs gathered during the rcynic run closest in time to the RIB dump timestamp.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 RPKI Deployment

Table 1 shows the number of IPv4 host addresses (/32s) covered by ROAs by each RIR publication point, along with the total number of IPv4 addresses delegated by each RIR. We observe that while ARIN has allocated the most address space, it lags behind other RIRs in ROA registrations, leading to a distorted view of RPKI deployment. Similar observations apply to APNIC.
