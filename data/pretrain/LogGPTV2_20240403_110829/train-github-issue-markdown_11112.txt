Hi,
I was trying to add Cairo, Gadfly and IJulia packages, and ran into some
issues.
  1. Gadlfy installed fine. But I can't use this.
julia> using Gadfly  
ERROR: IOString not defined  
in reload_path at loading.jl:144  
in _require at loading.jl:59  
in require at loading.jl:43  
while loading /home/mahesh/.julia/v0.3/Gadfly/src/weave.jl, in expression
starting on line 21  
while loading /home/mahesh/.julia/v0.3/Gadfly/src/Gadfly.jl, in expression
starting on line 71
  2. I can't install IJulia or Cairo. gives me the similar error
spawn: no such file or directory (ENOENT)  
while loading /home/mahesh/.julia/v0.3/Cairo/deps/build.jl, in expression
starting on line 129
Any thoughts on how to solve these?
Thank you.
