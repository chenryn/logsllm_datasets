Currently, the form component add some strong requirements on the way to
access field values. It would be a good idea to allow to specify a different
getter or setter (defaulting to the current behavior) to give more
flexibility.
And for collections, it would be a good idea to be able to use `addXXX` and
`removeXXX` instead of recreating the collection entirely using a `setXXXs`
setter, which has really bad performances for Doctrine toMany relations as it
removes all relations and add new ones.
