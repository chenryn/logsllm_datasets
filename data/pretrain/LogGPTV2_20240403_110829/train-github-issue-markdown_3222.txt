Currently, the form component imposes strict requirements on how field values are accessed. To enhance flexibility, it would be beneficial to allow the specification of custom getter and setter methods, with the current behavior serving as the default.

Additionally, for handling collections, it would be advantageous to support `addXXX` and `removeXXX` methods instead of requiring the entire collection to be re-created using a `setXXXs` setter. This is particularly important for Doctrine toMany relations, as the current approach of removing all existing relations and adding new ones can lead to significant performance issues.
