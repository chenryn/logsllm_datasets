### Existing Technologies and RDF

The adoption of existing technologies often comes at the cost of non-conformity to established standards. However, if we are to take RDF (Resource Description Framework) seriously, it becomes necessary to develop new methods to address well-known problems. One such example is the interpretation of domain and range restrictions. In traditional database systems, these restrictions are often interpreted as integrity constraints, which can be used to guide query optimization and rewriting. This approach, however, does not align with the official RDF definition, where domain and range restrictions are not seen as constraints but rather as production rules for deriving new information about the types of statements. The discrepancy between these interpretations stems from the fundamentally different semantic models underlying traditional databases and RDF. While database semantics are defined extensionally (where two queries subsume each other if one's result is a subset of the other's), RDF semantics are intensional, meaning that a statement cannot be derived simply because it holds for all objects.

### Challenges in RDF Schema

RDF introduces the notion of a schema in a way that presents new challenges not addressed by previous database work. Unlike traditional databases, RDF does not have a strict distinction between data and schema language. An RDF statement can contain schema information and can also cause other statements to become part of the schema definition, for example, by declaring a resource as a class. As a result, it is not always possible to determine whether a resource is part of the schema just by looking at it. In most cases, one must examine all statements to identify which resources describe schema elements. Even this may not be sufficient, as the fact that a resource is a class might only be implicitly contained in the RDF model. For instance, if a property is defined as a subproperty of the subclass relation, all resources connected by this relation can be inferred to be classes. This means that a reasoning step is required to determine the actual schema. Additionally, whenever new data is added, it is necessary to check whether the newly added statements alter the schema. This has significant implications for techniques like indexing and query optimization, which rely on schema information. In a distributed setting, the problem is even more complex, as statements from one source can influence the schema of another. To the best of my knowledge, there is no existing work that explicitly addresses this issue.

### Conclusions

RDF can be viewed as a new paradigm for storing and accessing information, combining features from other paradigms such as object-oriented and deductive databases, while also introducing unique aspects driven by the need for an open and distributed environment. From a research perspective, the challenge is twofold. First, relevant techniques developed for previous paradigms must be identified and adapted to meet the specific requirements of RDF. Second, the unique aspects of RDF, such as the lack of a clear distinction between data and schema, require the development of new methods. In traditional databases, algorithms are adapted to the data representation, whereas in RDF, the focus is on a flexible representation that can accommodate various ways of representing data, making it suitable as an exchange and communication format.

### Interaction Between Communities

These challenges are closely linked to the interaction between the database and semantic web communities. Unfortunately, mutual awareness between these communities remains limited. Semantic web research on RDF often overlooks relevant work from the database community, while the database community is beginning to recognize RDF as a promising model for web data, though their focus is more on XML. Real progress can only be achieved if both communities collaborate to develop techniques for storing and querying RDF as a new paradigm for next-generation web databases.

### SEWASIE Project

**SEWASIE (SEmantic Webs and AgentS in Integrated Economies)** aims to design and implement an advanced search engine that provides intelligent access to heterogeneous data sources on the web via semantic enrichment. The project offers a user-friendly query interface and supports integrated searching and negotiating, which can give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) a competitive edge. The system reduces transaction costs and promotes the use of key technologies for SMEs. The business scenario highlights the importance of accessing information, such as cheaper suppliers or innovative working methods, and the inadequacy of current internet search tools. SEWASIE addresses these issues by providing a more efficient and effective search solution.
