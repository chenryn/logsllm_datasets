existing technologies. In fact this is often done at the price of not conforming to the standard, but if we take
RDF seriously, then there is a need to develop new methods to deal with well known problems. An example is
the interpretation of domain and range restrictions. Interpreting these restrictions as integrity constraints like
often done in the database World makes it possible to use them to guide query optimization and re-writing.
This view of domain and range restriction, however, does not correspond with their official definition in
which they are not interpreted as constraints but rather as production rules that can be used to derive new
information about the type of statements. The problem reflected in this example is a result of fundamentally
different semantic models underlying traditional database models and RDF. While the semantics used for
databases is defined in an extensional way (two queries subsume each other if the result of one is a subset of
the result of the other), the RDF semantics is an intentional one; in particular, we cannot derive a statement
just because it holds for all objects.
3) Finally, the way RDF introduces the notion of a schema comes with new challenges that have not been
addressed by previous work on databases. The big difference here is that RDF does not have a strict
distinction between data and schema language. An RDF statement can contain information about the schema
and can also cause other statements to become part of the schema definition, for example by declaring a
certain resource to be of type class. As a consequence, it is not possible to tell whether a resource is part of the
schema definition just by looking at it. In most cases we have to look at all statements to find out which
resources describe schema elements. In many cases even this is not enough, because the fact that a resource is
of type class might only be implicitly contained in the RDF model, for instance if a property is defined to be a
subproperty of the subclass relation, all resources connected by this relation can be derived to be of type class.
This means that we need a reasoning step just find out how our schema actually looks like. It also implies that
whenever data is added to the model we first have to check whether the newly added statements cause the
schema to change. This has serious consequences for the applicability of many data techniques such as
indexing and query optimization, because these techniques often make use of information about the schema.
This effect is even more difficult to deal with in a distributed setting where statements from one source can
have an influence on the schema of the other sources and vice versa. To the best of my knowledge there is no
work that explicitly takes this problem into account.
Conclusions
My conclusion is that RDF can be seen as a new paradigm for storing and accessing information that combines
some well known features from other paradigms such as object oriented and deductive databases, but also
introduces new aspects that directly result from the aim to represent information in an open and distributed
83
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
environment. The challenge from a research point of view is now two-fold. The first task is to identify relevant
techniques that have been developed in the context of the previous paradigms RDF borrows from and to
adapt them to fit the special requirements of RDF. The second point is to identify and address the unique
aspects of RDF and develop methods that are able of dealing with the problems that arise from these aspects.
In my opinion, the lack of a distinction between data and schema is one of these aspects that ask for the
invention of new methods. In the case of databases, the algorithms are not adapted to the representation of the
data, but vice versa. The goal is to efficiently and effectively query the (distributed) data. The representation
should support that.
In RDF the focus is on the representation which needs to be flexible enough to accommodate many different
ways of representing data, because it is meant as an exchange and communication format between different
sources.
Both challenges as tightly connected with the interaction of the database and the semantic web community.
Unfortunately, it seems that the mutual awareness of these communities is still quite limited. Semantic Web
research on RDF is constantly in danger of ignoring relevant work from the database community. On the other
hand, the database community is starting to pay attention to RDF as a promising model for data on the Web.
Work in this direction rather focuses on XML as a new paradigm. I think that real progress can only be made if
the two communities join forces to develop techniques for storing and querying RDF as a new paradigm for
next generation databases on the web.

Canada and worldwide. At the basic layer, SemWebLab develops ontologies consisting of taxonomies that
classify Web objects along with rules, typed by taxonomies, for integrity checking and knowledge inference.
SemWebLab also studies agents that use ontologies to support, e.g., the similarity retrieval and composition of
learning objects. SemWebLab has a focus on metadata extraction to cope with the vast number of Web objects
that are natural language documents.

SEWASIE
EU IST Project
http://www.SEWASIE.org/
SEWASIE (SEmantic Webs and AgentS in Integrated Economies) aims to design and implement an advanced
search engine enabling intelligent access to heterogeneous data sources on the web via semantic enrichment to
provide the basis of structured secure web-based communication.
Introduction
SEWASIE is implementing an advanced search engine that provides intelligent access to heterogeneous data
sources on the web via semantic enrichment to provide the basis of structured secure web-based
communication. SEWASIE provides users with a search client that has an easy-to-use query interface, and
which can extract the required information from the Internet and can show it in a useful and user-friendly
format. From an architectural point of view, the prototype will provide a search engine client and indexing
servers and ontologies.
There are many benefits to be had from such a system. There will be a reduction of transaction costs by
efficient search and communication facilities. Within the business context, the system will support integrated
searching and negotiating, which will promote the take-up of key technologies for SMEs and give them a
competitive edge.
The Business Scenario
Throughout Europe, much of the industrial fabric is made of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
fields such as agriculture, manufacturing, commerce and services. For social and historical reasons, these tend
to aggregate into sectorial clusters in various parts of respective countries. Today, this kind of economic
organization is threatened by globalisation.
One of the keys to sustainability and success is being able to access information. This could be a cheaper
supplier, an innovative working method, a new market, potential clients, partners, sponsors, and so on.
Current Internet search tools are inadequate because they not only are they difficult to use, the search results
are often of little use with their pages and pages of hits.
Suppose an SME needs to find out
about a topic - a product, a supplier,
a fashion trend, a standard, etc. For
example, a search is made for ‘fabric
dyeing processes’ for the purpose of
finding out about the disposal of the
dyeing waste material. A query to
www.google.com for ‘fabric dyeing’
listed 44.600 hits at the time of
writing, which related not only
manufacturers of fabric dyeing
equipment, but also the history of
