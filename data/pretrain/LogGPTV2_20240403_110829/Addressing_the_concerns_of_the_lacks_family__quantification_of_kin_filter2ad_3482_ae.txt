Figure 9: Attacker’s uncertainty about values of
100 SNPs on chromosome 1 for two families, by ob-
serving (i) all 100 SNPs of the relative that reveals
his/her genome, and (ii) only 50 SNPs but using LD.
In Fig. 9, we display the decrease of genomic privacy with
respect to 100 SNPs of chromosome 1.8 We ﬁrst show the
diﬀerent privacy levels by using all 100 SNPs of the observed
relative (i.e., I1 or I2), and then show the same by using only
50 SNPs of the observed relative and LD values. We note
that the use of LD decreases privacy slightly more for the
ﬁrst familyt than for the second family. This is because we
randomly picked 50 diﬀerent SNPs for both families, and
those picked in the second family had weaker LD relation-
ships with other SNPs. We ﬁnally observe that the diﬀerence
between the two observation cases (50 SNPs with LD and
100 SNPs without LD) is higher for close relatives (mother,
child, or sibling) than for others.
We also evaluate the health privacy of the family members
of I1 and I2 considering their predispositions to various dis-
eases. We ﬁrst noticed that almost all important SNPs for
privacy-sensitive diseases aﬀected by genomic factors, like
Alzheimer’s, ischemic heart disease, or macular degenera-
tion, were revealed by I1 and I2. Due to lack of space, we
focus on Alzheimer’s as it is one of the most important dis-
eases that are mainly attributable to genetic factors. Having
two ApoE4 alleles (in SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 located on
8We consider only 100 SNPs here for the same reason as in
Section 4.
6. RELATED WORK
Stajano et al. [46] were among the ﬁrst to raise the is-
sue of kin privacy in genomics. Cassa et al. [19] provide
a framework for measuring the risks to siblings of someone
who reveals his SNPs. They show that the inference error
is substantially reduced when the sibling’s SNPs are known,
compared to when only the population frequencies are used.
We push this work further, by considering any kind of family
members, and LD relationship between SNPs, by proposing
and evaluating diﬀerent privacy metrics, and by presenting
a real attack scenario using publicly available data. Our
generic framework considers any observation of a family’s
genomic data, and the adversary’s background knowledge.
Several algorithms for inference on graphical models have
been proposed in the context of pedigree analysis. Exact
inference techniques on Bayesian networks are used in order
to map disease genes and construct genetic maps [26,34,38].
Monte Carlo methods (Gibbs sampling) were also proved
to be eﬃcient for genetic analyses in the case of complex
pedigrees [31,44,48]. All these methods aim to infer speciﬁc
genotypes given phenotypes (like diseases). Another paper
relies on Gibbs sampling in order to infer haplotypes (used
in association studies) from genotype data [36]. Genotype
imputation [39] is another technique used by geneticists to
complete missing SNPs based upon given genotyped data.
A similar approach has recently been used to infer high-
density genotypes in pedigrees, by relying notably on low-
resolution genotypes and identity-by-descent regions of the
genome [18]. None of these contributions addresses privacy.
We also brieﬂy summarize the research on the privacy
of genomic data in the following. Homer et al. [30] prove
that de-identiﬁcation is an ineﬀective way to protect the

works [27, 50, 52]. Most recently, Gymrek et al. [29] show
how they identiﬁed DNAs of several individuals who par-
ticipated in scientiﬁc studies. Fienberg et al. [25] propose
using diﬀerential privacy to protect the identities of scien-
tiﬁc study participants, however this approach reduces the
accuracy of the research results. Some pieces of work also
focus on protecting the privacy of genomic data and on pre-
serving utility in medical tests such as (i) search of a partic-
ular pattern in the DNA sequence [16,49], (ii) comparing the
similarity of DNA sequences [15,17,32], and (iii) performing
statistical analysis on several DNA sequences [35]. Further-
more, Ayday et al. propose privacy-preserving schemes for
medical tests and personalized medicine methods that use
patients’ genomic data [7,14]. For privacy-preserving clinical
genomics, a group of researchers proposes to outsource some
costly computations to a public cloud or semi-trusted service
provider [21, 51]. Finally, Ayday et al. propose techniques
for privacy-preserving management of raw genomes [13].
In contrast with these contributions, in this paper, we pro-
pose a novel and eﬃcient inference attack in order to recon-
struct genomic data of individuals given observed genomic
data of their family members and special characteristics of
genomic data. Furthermore, we quantify the genomic pri-
vacy of individuals as a result of this attack using diﬀerent
metrics, and show the real threat by using the data collected
from diﬀerent websites and OSNs.
7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed a novel reconstruction attack for in-
ferring the genomic data of individuals from the observed
genomes of their relatives, and we have compared several
metrics to quantify genomic and health privacy.
As pointed out by Rebecca Skloot, the author of “The
Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks”, the view we have today
of genomes is like a world map, but Google Street View
is coming very soon. This growing precision can be highly
beneﬁcial in terms of personalized medicine, but it can have
devastating consequences on a family’s peace of mind. As
we already mentioned, the Lacks family is just one (albeit
famous) example. In the future (and already today), peo-
ple of the same family might have very diﬀerent opinions on
whether to reveal genomic data, and this can lead to dis-
sent: relatives might have divergent perceptions of possible
consequences. It is high time for the security research com-
munity to prepare itself for this formidable challenge. The
genetic community is highly concerned about the fact that
the proliferation of negative stories could potentially lead to
a negative perception by the population and to tighter laws,
thus hampering scientiﬁc progress in this ﬁeld.
In future work, we plan to apply the proposed framework
to more pedigrees, in order to ﬁne tune our numerical results.
We will also study the trade-oﬀ between utility and privacy
of genomic data in order to design an optimized GPPM.
