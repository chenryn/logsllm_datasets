This  means  that  the  probability  that  the  overall  impact  of  iid 
random delays on ipdavg is outside the tolerable perturbation range 
(-s/2, s/2] is bounded.  In addition, that probability can be reduced 
to  be  arbitrarily  close  to  0  by  increasing  m,  the  number  of 
redundant  IPDs  averaged  for  embedding  the  watermark.    This 
result holds true regardless of the mean or the variance of the iid 
random  delays  added  by  the  attacker,  or  of  the  maximum 
quantization delay allowed for watermark embedding.

In  the  previous  section,  we  established  an  upper  bound  for 
watermark bit vulnerability 
 through the Chebyshev 
inequality.  We  now  show  how  to  apply  the  well-known  Central 
Limit Theorem of statistics[4] to get an accurate approximation to 
the distribution of the robustness of the embedded watermark bit.

The theorem indicates that whenever a random sample of size n 
is taken from any distribution with mean µ and finite variance σ2, 
the sample mean 
nX  will be approximately normally distributed 
with mean µ and variance σ2/n, or equivalently the distribution of 
random variable 
 will be approximately a standard 
normal distribution.

7.  WATERMARK DETECTION 
Watermark  detection  refers  to  the  process  of  determining  if  a 
given watermark is embedded in the IPDs of a specific connection 
or flow. 
Let  the  information  shared  between  the  watermark  embedder 
and decoder be represented as , where S() is the 
selection  function  that  returns  (l+1)×m  packets,  m≥1  is  the 
number  of  redundant  pairs  of  packets  in  which  to  embed  one 
watermark bit, l>0 is the length of the watermark in bits, s>0 is 
the  quantization  step  size,  and  wm  is  the  l-bit  watermark  to  be 
detected. Let f denote the flow to be examined and wmf denote the 
decoded l bits from flow f. 
The watermark detector works as follows: 
1)  Decode the l-bit wmf from flow f. 
2)  Compare the decoded wmf with wm. 
3)  Report  that  watermark  wm  is  detected  in  flow  f  if  the 
Hamming  distance  between  wmf  and  wm,  represented  as 
H(wmf,  wm),  is  less  than  or  equal  to  h,  where  h  is  a 
threshold parameter determined by the user, and 0≤ h<l. 
The  rationale  behind  using  the  Hamming  distance  rather  than 
requiring  an  exact  match  to  detect  the  presence  of  wm  is  to 
increase  the  robustness  of  the  watermark  detector  against 
countermeasures by the attacker. Given any quantization step size 
s, there is always a slight chance that the embedded watermark bit 
is  corrupted  by  countermeasures  by  the  attacker  no  matter  how 
many  redundant  pairs  of  packets  are  used.  Let  0<p<1  be  the 
probability  that  each  embedded  watermark  bit  will  survive  the 
timing perturbation by the attacker. Then the probability that all l 
bits  survive  the  timing  perturbation  by  the  attacker  will  be  pl. 
When  l  is  reasonably  large,  pl  will  tend  to  be  small  unless  p  is 
very close to 1. 
By using the Hamming distance h to detect watermark wmf, the 
expected watermark detection rate will be 
h

For example, for the values p=0.9102, l=24, h=5, the expected 
watermark  detection  rate  with  exact  bit  match  would  be  pl 
=10.45%.    For  the  same  values  of  p,  l,  and  h,  the  expected 
watermark detection rate using a Hamming distance h=5 would be 
98.29%. 
It is possible for the watermark detector to mistakenly report a 
watermark for a flow in which no watermark has been embedded. 
It is termed a collision between wm and f if H(wmf, wm)≤h for an 
unwatermarked flow f.   
Assuming  the  l-bit  wmf  extracted  from  random  flow  f  is 
uniformly  distributed,  then  the  expected  watermark  collision
