To identify patterns from the logs, we can generalize the specific instance provided. The log entry indicates that the shuffle port assigned by the ContainerManager for a particular attempt is 13562. To represent this in a more generic and pattern-inducing format, you can use:

**Shuffle port returned by ContainerManager for attempt_<attempt_id>: <port_number>**

For example:
- **Shuffle port returned by ContainerManager for attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000000_0: 13562**

This format clearly shows the structure of the log entry and allows for easy identification of the attempt ID and the corresponding port number.
