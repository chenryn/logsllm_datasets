User: I have read the documentation but I don't understand.
Why do I have to use distutils to install python modules ?
Why do I just can't save the modules in python path ?
Assistant: You don't have to use distutils to get your own modules working on your own machine; saving them in your python path is sufficient.
When you decide to publish your modules for other people to use, distutils provides a standard way for them to install your modules on their machines.  (The "dist" in "distutils" means distribution, as in distributing your software to others.)
