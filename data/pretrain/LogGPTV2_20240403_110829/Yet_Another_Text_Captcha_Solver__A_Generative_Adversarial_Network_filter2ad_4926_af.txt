### Early CAPTCHA Schemes and Their Limitations

Early CAPTCHA schemes, such as those used by Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google [64], have been the subject of various research efforts. Gao et al. [15] focused on CAPTCHAs with hollow characters. Their approach involves filling the hollow character strokes and then searching for possible combinations of adjacent strokes to recognize individual characters. While effective for hollow characters, this method is ineffective for CAPTCHAs with overlapping and distorted characters. Unlike our approach, these attacks are tightly coupled to specific CAPTCHA schemes and are difficult to generalize. To target a new CAPTCHA scheme, they would require human involvement to revise existing heuristics and possibly design new ones.

### Decaptcha and Other Machine Learning Approaches

Decaptcha [8] employs machine-learning-based classifiers to develop a generic attack for text-based CAPTCHAs. It can break 13 CAPTCHA schemes but fails to achieve success on more challenging schemes, including reCAPTCHA and Googleâ€™s own scheme. In contrast, our approach not only provides higher accuracy on the schemes where Decaptcha succeeds but also achieves an 87.4% success rate on reCAPTCHA, which Decaptcha cannot solve (see Table 4).

A more recent work by Gao et al. [17] uses the Log-Gabor filter, a classical signal processing algorithm, to extract character components from the CAPTCHA image. They then use the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to recognize individual characters based on the extracted information. However, due to the limitations of the Log-Gabor filter, their approach is ineffective for CAPTCHA images with noisy backgrounds, as demonstrated by its failure to recognize the Baidu CAPTCHA shown in Figure 1a.

George et al. [19] present a hierarchical model called the Recursive Cortical Network (RCN) for image recognition. While RCN is effective in recognizing individual characters, it is less effective for solving text-based CAPTCHAs compared to our approach. Our approach outperforms all three CAPTCHA schemes showcased in the RCN work, particularly boosting the success rate on the PayPal dataset from 57.1% to 92.4%.

Stark et al. [55] demonstrate that active learning can reduce the number of CAPTCHAs required to learn a solver. However, this approach requires access to a CAPTCHA generator, which is often unavailable to adversaries. Active learning can complement our approach by allowing the learning engine to use fewer training samples to speed up the training process [45, 46].

Compared to these prior generic attacks, our approach is the most effective, delivering a higher success rate and successfully attacking some current CAPTCHA schemes where others have failed.

### Alternative CAPTCHA Schemes

It is worth noting that there are also CAPTCHA schemes built around images [1, 3, 13, 24, 44] or audio data [6, 50]. Many of these were proposed to replace text-based CAPTCHAs. Unfortunately, these alternative schemes are less popular than text CAPTCHAs and have also been shown to be vulnerable [9, 18, 40, 43, 54, 58]. A significant weakness of image-based schemes is the limited number of images used, making them susceptible to side-channel attacks where adversaries can obtain and label a large portion of the images [29].

### Adversarial Machine Learning and Our Approach

Our work builds upon the foundations of adversarial machine learning [22, 30]. This technique has been shown to be useful in constructing adversarial applications to bypass malware detection [49, 61], escape spam mail filtering [5], or confuse machine learning classifiers [23, 41]. However, no prior work has employed this technique to construct a generic solver for text CAPTCHAs, and our work is the first to do so.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first generative-adversarial-network (GAN)-based solver for text-based CAPTCHAs. Our solver is automatically learned from training examples, enabling it to target a wide range of schemes. Unlike previous machine-learning-based attacks, our approach requires significantly fewer real CAPTCHAs to construct the solver. We achieve this by first learning a CAPTCHA synthesizer to generate synthetic training examples to build a base solver, and then refining the base solver using transfer learning on a small set of real CAPTCHAs. The key advantage of our attack is that it needs less human involvement when targeting a new CAPTCHA scheme, making it easier to adjust to the ever-changing CAPTCHA landscape.

Our approach was evaluated on 33 text CAPTCHA schemes, including 11 schemes used by 32 of the top-50 popular websites at the time of the study. Our approach outperforms four prior state-of-the-art methods by successfully solving more CAPTCHAs. We show that our approach is robust and generally applicable, capable of breaking many advanced security features used by modern text CAPTCHAs. Our results suggest that these advanced features make it difficult for legitimate users but fail to stop automated programs. Given the progress in deep learning and generative adversarial approaches for image-related tasks, the insights provided in this work can help security experts revisit the design and usability of text CAPTCHAs.
