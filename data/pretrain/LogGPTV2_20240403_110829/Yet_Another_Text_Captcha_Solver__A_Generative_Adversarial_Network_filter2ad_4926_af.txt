early captcha schemes used by Yahoo!, Microsoft and Google [64].
The work presented by Gao et al. targets captchas of hollow charac-
ters [15]. Their approach first fills the hollow character strokes, and
then searches for the possible combinations of adjacent character
strokes to recognize individual characters. While are effective on
hollow characters, this approach is ineffective on captcha images
with overlapping and distorted characters. Unlike our approach,
all the aforementioned attacks are tightly coupled to the captcha
scheme and hard to generalize. This means to target a new captcha
scheme, they would require human involvement to revise the exist-
ing heuristics and possibly to design new heuristics.
Decaptcha [8] employs machine-learning-based classifiers to
develop a generic attack for text-based captchas. It is able to break
13 captcha schemes but achieves zero success on more difficult
schemes including reCAPTCHA and Goolge’s own scheme. By
contrast, our approach not only gives a higher accuracy on the
schemes where Decpatcha succeeds, but also delivers a success rate
of 87.4% on reCAPTCHA for which Decaptcha has a success rate of
zero (see Table 4). A more recent work presented by Gao et al. [17]
uses the Log-Gabor filter, a classical signal processing algorithm,
to first extract character components from the captcha image; it
then uses the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to recognize individual
characters using the extracted information. Due to the limitation
of the Log-Gabor filter, their approach is ineffective for captcha
images with noisy backgrounds. For example, their approach fails to
recognize the Baidu captcha shown in Figure 1a. Recently, George
et al. presents a hierarchical model called the Recursive Cortical
Network (RCN) for image recognition [19]. The RCN is effective in
recognizing individual characters but are less effective for solving
text-based captchas when compared to our approach. Our approach
outperforms all the three captcha schemes showcased in the RCN
work (on the same testing dataset from the RCN paper) [19]. In
particular, on the PayPal dataset, our approach boosts the success
rate from 57.1% to 92.4%. Stark et al. [55] show that active learning
can be used to reduce the number of captchas required to learn a
solver. However, this approach requires having access to a captcha
generator of the target scheme, which is often not available to the
adversary. On the other hand, active learning is complementary
to our approach as it allows the learning engine to use a fewer
number of training samples to speed up the training process [45, 46].
Compared to these prior generic attacks, our approach is by far
the most effective generic attack – it delivers a higher success rate
and can successfully attack some current captcha schemes where
others failed.
It is worth mentioning that there are also other captcha schemes
built around images [1, 3, 13, 24, 44] or audio data [6, 50]. Many of
these were proposed to replace text-based captchas. Unfortunately,
these alternative schemes are less popular than text captchas and
were shown to be vulnerable too [9, 18, 40, 43, 54, 58]. In particular, a
significant weakness of an image-based scheme is that the number
of images used by the scheme is typically limited. As result, an
adversary may exploit side channels to obtain and label a large
portion of the images used by a scheme [29].
As a final remark, we would like to point out that our work
builds upon the foundations of adversarial machine learning [22, 30].
This technique is shown to be useful in constructing adversarial
applications to bypass malware detection [49, 61], escape from spam
mail filtering [5], or confuse machine learning classifiers [23, 41].
However, no work to date has employed the technique to construct
a generic solver for text captchas and our work is the first to do so.
9 CONCLUSION
This paper has presented the first generative-adversarial-network
based solver for text-based captchas. Our solver is automatically
learned from training examples and hence can target a wide range
of schemes. As a departure from prior machine-learning-based at-
tacks, our approach requires significantly fewer real captchas to
construct the solver. We achieve this by first learning a captcha
synthesizer to automatically generate synthetic training examples
to build a base solver, and then refining the base solver by applying
transfer learning to a small set of real captchas. The key advantage
of our attack is that it needs less human involvement when target-
ing a new captcha scheme. This means that our attack can be easily
adjusted to catch up with the ever-changing captcha scheme.
Our approach was evaluated on 33 text captcha schemes, includ-
ing 11 schemes that were being used by 32 of the top-50 popular
websites at the time the work was conducted. Our approach out-
performs four prior state-of-the arts by successfully solving more
captchas. We show that our approach is robust and generally ap-
plicable, which can break many advanced security features used
by modern text captchas. Our results suggest that these advanced
features only make it difficult for a legitimate user but would fail to
stop automated programs. Given that deep learning and generative
adversarial based approaches are making great progress in solving
image-related tasks, the insights provided in this work can help
security experts to revisit the design and usability of text captchas.
