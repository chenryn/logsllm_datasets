User: I'm new to Mac, and I have OS X 10.9.1. The main question is whether it is better to create a virtual machine with Linux and do port forwarding or set all packages directly to the Mac OS and work with it directly? If I create a virtual machine, I'm not sure how it will affect the health of SSD and ease of development. On the other hand, I also do not know how to affect the stability and performance of Mac OS installation packages directly into it. Surely there are some best practices, but I do not know them.
Assistant: I do all of my main development on OSX. I deploy on a linux box. Pycharm (CE) is your friend.
