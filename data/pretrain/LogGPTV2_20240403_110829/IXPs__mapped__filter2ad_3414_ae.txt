are typically small and isolated.
For the remaining 6 undetected but active IXPs, we were
unable to ﬁnd target addresses and run traceroutes to their
networks. While IXPs typically tend to disclose their mem-
ber list, we found four IXPs that didn’t disclose them. Inter-
estingly, DNS names or other techniques can often be used
to reverse-engineer the peering participants, and for two of
the above IXPs, we succeeded in identifying their members.
We also encountered two IXPs that assigned private ASNs
to their members. This policy prevents us from ﬁnding ad-
dresses to launch our traceroutes.
Lastly, based on 3rd-party information, we were able to
classify the remaining 38 undetected IXPs into defunct (22),
planned (7), not an IXP (3), temporarily down (1), and
unknown (5). Here, unknown means that the evidence we
have is either too weak or contradictory.
6.2 Membership and Mapping methods
Sec. 3.3 describes three techniques for mapping IXP ad-
dresses to the ASN of their corresponding members. The
DNS mapping and the majority selection are error-prone as
they rely on IP to AS mapping which is inaccurate. The
mapping extracted from BGP tables at IXPs is accurate
and has additional beneﬁts, and hence we make extensive
use of this technique. One beneﬁt of relying on the mapping
extracted from BGP tables at IXPs is that it helps discov-
ering new peerings that we would have ignored otherwise.
For example, we typically ignore traceroutes that contains a
non-responsive router (“*”) before or after the IXP address.
However, if we can map the IXP address directly to its cor-
responding member, we do not need the presence of an IP
address after the IXP address. This technique is particu-
larly eﬃcient when the traceroute contains many “*”s as is
typically the case for traceroutes with source-routing (see
Sec. 4.3). Using this property, we discovered 20% additional
peerings in our LSRR traces. The diﬀerence is less signiﬁ-
cant in regular traceroutes where “*”s occur less frequently.
A second beneﬁt of BGP mapping is for assessing the ac-
curacy of the majority selection and DNS-based techniques.
Our targeted traceroutes traversed a total of 4,114 IXP ad-
dresses, and 65% of them were present in BGP tables and
could thus be checked. 94% of those veriﬁable addresses
were conﬁrmed. The DNS mapping is less accurate: 38%
of the 7,019 addresses could be checked, but only 77% of
them were correct. Note, however, that there can be cases
where the majority selection gives a result that is diﬀer-
ent than expected, but not necessarily wrong. For example,
we checked the members of the Amsterdam Exchange Point
(AMS-IX) for which the majority selection and the BGP
method disagreed. Several ISPs own diﬀerent ASNs, and
so the diﬀerent mapping techniques yielded diﬀerent ASNs.
E.g., for EUnet, the BGP method gave AS6667, while the
majority selection technique produced AS790. EUnet uses
the former ASN in its international backbone, and the latter
for domestic operations.
Regarding completeness, Sec. 5.6 showed a gap between
the member lists published by IXPs on their websites and the
member lists inferred from our dataset. More speciﬁcally, we
have a coverage greater than 90% for only 17% of the 112
IXPs that we checked. Among them, we ﬁnd some of the
bigger IXPs like AMS-IX, DE-CIX and LINX. Half of the
checked IXPs have a coverage of lower than 60%.
6.3 Peerings
As mentioned earlier, 166 IXPs publish a list of their mem-
bers. While the lists for big IXPs are clearly dynamically
updated (e.g., they are read directly from the IXP route
server), others are manually maintained and tend to be out-
of-date (e.g., checking last modiﬁcation date, we found pages
that are up to seven years old).
Given that the peering matrices published by just a few
IXPs are of unknown quality, we lack ground truth. Our
measurement method outputs a list of peerings extracted
from various datasets, but these peerings may be incorrect
(see Sec. 3.3). We next describe a mechanism for assign-
ing a level of conﬁdence to our detected IXP peerings by
combining several sources of information to “rate” the valid-
ity of each peering. Our method is based on the following
properties of a given peering AS1 IXP AS4 (see Fig. 1):
rev: We also observed the reverse peering AS4 IXP AS1.
Note however that this only applies if there is a LG in AS4,
and routing between AS1 and AS4 through the IXP is sym-
metric. Note that in many cases, we do not have an appro-
priate LG and so these two conditions may not be satisﬁed.
p1bgp: AS1 is a member of the IXP, as per our BGP
LGs. Therefore, even if AS1 was obtained by mapping an
IP address, we know that this mapping was correct.
p2bgp: AS4 was obtained directly by mapping the IXP
address to its member’s ASN, according to our BGP LGs.
345Thus we did not rely on the majority selection at all, and
can consider this mapping to be correct.
p1right: We found AS1 in the “right” part of another
peering (e.g. AS3 IXP AS1). The fact that we observe a
member on both sides of a peering reduces the chance that
the IP-to-AS mapping is incorrect.
p2left: We found AS4 in the “left” part of another peering
(e.g. AS4 IXP AS3); same reasoning as p1right.
p1maddr: We found multiple IP addresses on the “left”
part of the peering, all of which were mapped to AS1. If we
ﬁnd a single address that maps to AS1, it is possible that
the mapping is incorrect because the paths go through a sin-
gle router which systematically responds with an incorrect
interface. On the contrary, if the paths go through multiple
addresses, it is less likely that all these routers respond with
an incorrect address.
mjuasn: We applied the majority selection rule over at
least two addresses, all of which were mapped to AS4. If we
see multiple addresses, and all addresses map to the same
AS, the mapping is likely correct.
After determining these properties for each peering, we
deﬁne the following combinations of properties to classify
the peerings; i.e., to rate our level of conﬁdence in the cor-
rectness of the discovered peerings:
High conﬁdence: Assigned to peerings with the prop-
erties rev or (p1bgp and p2bgp); i.e., peerings which we
have observed in both directions, or for which both ASNs
are known to belong to the IXP.
Medium conﬁdence: Assigned to peerings with the
properties (p1bgp or p1right or p1maddr) and (p2bgp or
p2left or mjuasn)); i.e., peerings for which only one mem-
ber is known to belong to the IXP and which rely only on a
(seemingly correct) majority selection process.
Low conﬁdence: Assigned to the remaining peerings.
This designation does not mean that the peering is incorrect;
we just do not have enough evidence to assert its correctness.
The “validated” columns in Tables 5 and 6 show the num-
ber of discovered peerings for which we have a “high conﬁ-
dence” and which we view as being validated. Of the 28.8K
peerings found by targeted traceroutes, we were able to as-
signed a “high conﬁdence” to 23K of them (75%). Of those
23K links, 2.7K were classiﬁed this way because they sat-
isﬁed rev, i.e., we observed the peering in both directions.
The remaining ones were assigned “high conﬁdence” because
both members are known to belong to the IXP. While 3K
peerings were assign a “medium conﬁdence”, only 2.8K peer-
ing ended up being classiﬁes to have “low conﬁdence”. To
illustrate the “best eﬀort” nature of the IRR, we found that
about 15% of the “high conﬁdence” peerings are present in
the IRR; for peerings with a “medium” and “low” conﬁdence,
the numbers are 7% and 2%, respectively.
6.4 Peering matrices
We examined 111 IXPs, and only four of them publish
their peering matrices. Even for those four, we do not know
if it represents the ground truth. For example, the matrix
published on the LONAP website is obtained by extract-
ing peering information about each member from the whois
database, which is known to have stale entries and does not
reﬂect the peerings actually made at the IXP. In the case
of VIX, the published peering matrix is inferred from mea-
sured traﬃc that traversed the links over some time interval
in the past. Thus, any comparisons of published peering
matrices with those obtained by our method have to be in-
terpreted with care. Table 8 shows the number of peerings
found at 8 selected IXPs. To build this table, we only con-
sidered peerings discovered in the various datasets that fell
in the “high conﬁdence” category and ignored the “medium”
and “low” conﬁdence peerings. The last column gives the
total number of (“high conﬁdence”) peerings detected in all
of the datasets. In the absence of the ground truth, to pro-
vide some calibration of the number of discovered IXP peer-
ings, we computed the maximum number of peerings for
each of the 8 IXPs (i.e., n∗ (n− 1)/2 where n is the number
of members/participants at the IXP) and consider the two
cases where 60% and 30% of the entries of the peering matri-
ces are populated. While the 30% case reﬂects a relatively
sparse peering matrix, the 60% case represents a possibly
unrealistically high degree of peering at IXPs. We note that
our method clearly outperforms the other methods, even
though there are peerings discovered in the other datasets
that we miss, mainly because of the constraints imposed by
the locations and number of our LGs.
Examining Table 7, we note that even when assuming,
for example, that real-world peering matrices tend to be
sparse and have only about 30% of their entries populated,
the number of peerings we ﬁnd with our method at these
selected IXPs is still oﬀ this 30% target. Assuming less
sparser peering matrices (e.g., 60% of all possible peerings
have been established), this diﬀerence becomes even larger.
This suggests that despite the dominance of our method over
the other methods, there is room for improvements. Other
indications that improvements may be possible are are seen
in Table 4 where we observe that the diﬀerent datasets yield
a substantial number of unique peerings. The typically low
level of overlap between the diﬀerent methods suggests that
more peerings exists and that the total number of IXP peer-
ings among all the datasets exceeds the 58K that we found
to date or the 44K that we have validated. This observa-
tion is further supported by Table 7 that shows the num-
ber of IXP-related peerings discovered by mining the IXP
databases discussed earlier. While PeeringDB and PCH do
not provide any peering information, the IRR seems to be a
rich source of information since it yields some 18K peerings
at only 80 IXPs. However, in the absence of any ground
truth for peerings at IXPs, all that Tables 4, 5, and 7 say is
that while our proposed method clearly outperforms the cur-
rently available methods as far as detecting peerings at IXPs
is concerned, there may still be room for improvements. How
much room remains an open problem, though, mainly be-
cause the reasons why peering matrices may not be full can
vary. We discuss some of these reasons in the next section.
6.5 Weakness of our methodology
The main weakness of our methodology is that we entirely
depend on the available LGs (and LSRR-capable routers).
As a result, we will never be able to check the peering be-
tween two members if we do not have a LG in one of them or
in one of their 1- or 2-hop neighbors. Given that we rely on
publicly available LGs, some of the actual peerings will re-
main uncovered by our method. Furthermore, having a LG
in a member might not be enough, as its geographic location
also matters. Consider for example Limelight (AS22822). It
oﬀers a LG at multiple routers in diﬀerent locations which
enables us to check its peerings at many IXPs. However,
many other networks only provide a LG at a single router.

Table 8: Peerings found at selected IXPs.
This router’s particular location is likely to preclude the dis-
covery of the network’s other peerings at other locations.
One way trying to circumvent this problem is to make more
and better use of source-routing, but this comes at a cost as
shown in Table 5.
Second, for several reasons, two members at an IXP might
simply not peer at that IXP. For example, they might have
a direct peering. For instance, BT (AS5400) and Google
(AS15169) are both members of the AMS-IX, but we did
not detect a peering at this IXP in spite of having 3 LGs in
BT. Instead, we observed a direct path from BT to Google.
Another possibility is that the members have established
a private peering at the IXP. In this case, they directly
plugged a cable between their routers, and the path does
not go through the public fabric, which prevents the detec-
tion via our method. Finally, there are the possibilities of
conﬁguration errors, or members are simply not interested in
peering with one another at the IXP because they exchange
only a very small amount of traﬃc.
7. ANALYSIS
Using the information we obtained for the 223 IXPs we
detected, we present below the results of our analysis of
IXP-speciﬁc data. The data consists of discovered peerings
(with associated conﬁdence attributes) and IXP member-
ship information, and the metrics of interest are IXP size,
member presence, member connectivity, and member multi-
connectivity.
