Background on 
Authentication
Identification
 The method used by a system (not 
necessarily a computer) to uniquely 
identify an individual or group.
Examples: User names, Driver’s       
License, School ID,
Security Badge, 
Passport
Authentication
 The method(s) used to verify the given 
identification against a database of 
known information.
Examples: Passwords, 
Fingerprints, Iris Prints,
Negotiation
Development of Authentication
 What you know…
 What you have…
 What you are…
 Future Development: How you are...
General Network Security
Security is NOT
 Installing a firewall
 A product or Service
 Running an audit and shutting things 
off
Security IS
 Working productively and without 
interruptions
 Only as good as the weakest link
 Risk management of resources (equipment, 
people)
 Physical security
 A process, methodology, policies and people
 Is 24x7x365
General Network Security
 No silver bullet to network security
 Replay attacks
 Denial of Service ((D)DoS)
 Spoofing
 Users
 Dictionary Attacks
Security Thoughts
 80-90% are internal issues
 Hard drive crash (what did you loose, 
and how long to get back up?)
 Firewall penetration (what can they do, 
what do they see?)
 Internet failed (how much lost 
productivity/revenue, backup net 
connection?)
 Some can always get in
General Network Security 
Conclusion
 Biometrics will help but will not solve all 
problems
 Users are the “weakest link”
 Proactive security plan
Need for High Grade 
Authentication
Need for High Grade 
Authentication
 High Security Areas
 Multiple Factor Authentication
 Challenge and Response Authentication
 High Assurance of Proper Identification
 Data Retrieval Based on the Person
Background on Error Types
Type I Error --- Accept in Error
 Balance Between Type I and Type II 
Error
 Most Dangerous
 High Exposure
 Preventable
 Need for Additional Security Measures
Type II --- Deny in Error
 Balance Between Type I and Type II 
Error
 Only an Inconvenience
 Prventable
 Established by a High Security Policy

Problems
Proper Network Security With 
Biometric Devices
Securing Biometric Signatures
 Tamper resistant storage
 Protection from corruption
 Secure signature changes
 Secure backups
 Stop signature interception
 Protect latent signatures
Logon Security
 Trusted Path to the authentication 
device 
 Tamper resistance 
 Clear or encrypted transmission
 Continuous monitoring
 What “goes down the wire”?
 Real biometric?
Bypass Prevention
 Tamper resistance at the local machine
 Enhanced biometrics to tell a real 
biometric from a fake biometric 
 Both biometrics and passwords needed 
Consistency
 Environmental effects 
 All network users adhere to the same 
policy
 All network machines configured 
identically
Can Biometrics be Bypassed?
 How they are connected
 The device can be fooled
 Consistency
Demos and Discussion
Demo of Fingerprint Scanner 
Authentication
Demo of Iris Scanner 
Authentication
Wire Capture Analysis
Recent Bypassing Methods
How to Bypass
