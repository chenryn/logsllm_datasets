### Participant Demographics and Experiment Overview

The majority of participants (399 out of 1047) reported having a Bachelor’s degree as their highest level of education, while 34% chose not to disclose this information. During the experiment, 931 participants started but did not complete the task, often stopping after the first few comparisons. Additionally, 160 users found the general task to be annoying.

### Discussion

Our study results indicate that, although there are subtle speed variations among different approaches, the attack detection rate and user perception for the current state-of-the-art hexadecimal key-fingerprint representation are significantly lower compared to most alternative schemes. Language-based representations, with the exception of the PGP word list, showed improved user behavior, leading to a higher detection rate of attacks. Based on these findings, we propose several takeaways to enhance the usability of key-fingerprints.

#### 6.1 Takeaways

- **High Accuracy and Speed**: All representation schemes achieved high accuracy (high attack detection rates) and were performed quickly by users.
- **Language-Based Resilience**: As expected, language-based fingerprint representations were more resilient against attacks, achieving higher attack detection rates and better usability scores.
- **Alphanumeric Performance**: Among all conditions, alphanumeric approaches (e.g., hexadecimal and Base32) performed worse. The numeric representation was more suitable than hexadecimal and Base32, showing similar speed but with a higher attack detection rate and better usability ratings from end-users.
- **Chunking Impact**: Our chunking experiment revealed that chunk sizes play only a minor role in improving attack detection rates, with no statistically significant differences. However, for hexadecimal representations, chunks of 3 and 4 characters performed best.
- **Word List Representations**: Larger dictionaries in word list representations can increase comparison speed, indicating room for improvement in this area. Despite providing the same level of security, exotic-looking solutions are perceived as more secure by end-users.

#### 6.2 Limitations

- **Practical Willingness**: Our study design does not test whether end-users are willing to compare fingerprints in practice; it only assesses the ease of comparison from the users' perspective.
- **External Validity**: There is a concern about the external validity of results from MTurk studies, as real-world users might behave differently. This is due to two main reasons: (1) fingerprint comparisons occur less frequently in practice, and (2) practical comparisons carry more importance than anonymous online studies. Additionally, MTurkers are generally more tech-savvy and better at solving textual and visual tasks compared to the average population, which may have influenced the results.
- **Study Design Constraints**: Due to the within-group part of our factorial design, many parameters such as different fonts, font sizes, and attack rates could not be considered. These are interesting avenues for future research.
- **Anonymity and Language Proficiency**: The anonymous nature of online studies makes it difficult to reliably determine participants' language fluency. We specified that participants should be from English-speaking countries, but compliance was based on self-reported data. Non-native speakers may face additional barriers with language-based representations due to unfamiliar words.

### Conclusion and Future Work

We evaluated six different key-fingerprint representation types—numeric, alphanumeric (hexadecimal and Base32), word lists (PGP and Peerio), and generated sentences—regarding their comparison speed, attack detection accuracy, and usability. Our results show that large word lists (as used in Peerio) lead to the fastest comparison performance, while generated sentences achieve the highest attack detection rates. Additional parameters like chunking play a minor role in overall performance. The widely-used hexadecimal representation scheme performed worst in all tested categories, indicating a need for more usable alternatives.

Future work should explore line breaks, font settings, dictionaries, different attacker strengths, and other parameters to further improve performance. Additionally, research is needed to motivate more users to actually compare fingerprints in practice, as this study does not address that aspect.
