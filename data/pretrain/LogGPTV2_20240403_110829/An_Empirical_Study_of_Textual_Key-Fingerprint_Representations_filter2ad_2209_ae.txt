The majority of the participants stated to have a Bach-
elor’s degree (399 of 1047) as their highest education
whereas 34% chose not to answer. 931 participants have
started our HIT but stopped early during the experiment
(mostly after the ﬁrst few comparisons). 160 users re-
ported the general task to be annoying.
6 Discussion
The results of our study show that while there are subtle
speed variations among all approaches, the attack detec-
tion rate and user perception for the current state-of-the-
art hexadecimal key-ﬁngerprint representation is signif-
icantly lower than those of most alternative representa-
tion schemes. Language-based representations (with the
exception of the PGP word list) show improved user be-
haviour leading to a higher detection rate of attacks. To
improve the usability of key-ﬁngerprints, we propose the
following takeaways based on our study results.
6.1 Takeaways
Our results show that all representation schemes achieve
a high accuracy (high attack detection rate) and can be
performed quickly by users. As expected, language-
based ﬁngerprint
representations are more resilient
against attacks (higher attack detection rate) and achieve
better usability scores. Among all conditions, alphanu-
meric approaches performed worse and have been out-
performed. For instance, the numeric representation was
more suitable than hexadecimal and Base32. The raw
performance results suggest a similar speed for the nu-
meric representation with a higher attack detection rate,
and it also has received better usability ratings from end-
users.
Our chunking experiment has shown that chunk-sizes
play only a minor role in improving attack detection rates
(we could not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant differences).
However, if a hexadecimal representation is used chunks
of 3 and 4 characters perform best.
As shown by the word list representations, the compar-
ison speed can be increased by larger dictionaries leav-
ing room for improvement in this area. Even though all
representation schemes provide the same level of secu-
rity, exotic looking solutions are considered to be more
secure by end users.
6.2 Limitations
Most importantly, our study design does not test whether
end users are actually willing to compare any ﬁnger-
prints in practice. We only aim to study how easy differ-
ent representations are to compare from the users’ point
of view.
As with any user study conducted with MTurk, there
is concern about the external validity of the results: users
in the real world might show different behaviour. This
is mainly because of two reasons: (1) in practice ﬁnger-
print comparisons will seldom occur in a such frequency,
and (2) when performed in practice play a more impor-
tant role than just participating in an anonymous online
study. Additionally, MTurkers have been shown to be
more tech-savvy and are better in solving textual and vi-
sual tasks in comparison to the average population. Thus,
they could have performed better in most of the compar-
ison conditions than the average population.
It is also
known that some MTurkers just “click through” studies
to get the fee and thus distort study results. Our coun-
terbalanced study design with included control questions
and statistical signiﬁcance tests mitigate this effect. For
instance, we excluded 46 out of 1047 participants from
our main study part based on these questions being an-
swered incorrectly.
Due to the within-group part of our factorial design,
many parameter choices such as different fonts, font
sizes, attack rates, etc. could not be considered. These
are, however, interesting avenues for future work. As
shown in our additional chunking experiment, another
challenge in testing different parameters is the high at-
tack detection rate, where subtle changes would require
a high amount of users to produce statistically signiﬁcant
results.
Due to the anonymous nature of online studies, it is

also impossible to reliably tell which languages a partic-
ipant is ﬂuent in. We speciﬁed that we only wanted par-
ticipants from English-speaking countries, however we
had no way of checking compliance except by relying
on self-reported data. Language-based representation ap-
proaches might induce additional barriers for non-native
speakers, e. g., due to unknown or unfamiliar words.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We evaluated six different key-ﬁngerprint representation
types with regards to their comparison speed, attack de-
tection accuracy and usability, which encompasses at-
tack detection but also resilience against human errors
in short-term memory. An online study with 1047 partic-
ipants was conducted to compare numeric, alphanumeric
(Hexadecimal and Base32), word lists (PGP and Peerio),
as well as generated sentences representation schemes
for key-ﬁngerprint veriﬁcation. All ﬁngerprint represen-
tations were conﬁgured to offer the same level of security
with the same attacker strength.
Our results show that usage of the large word lists (as
used in Peerio) lead to the fastest comparison perfor-
mance, while generated sentences achieved highest at-
tack detection rates. In addition, we found that additional
parameters such as chunking of characters plays only a
minor role in the overall performance. The widely-used
hexadecimal representation scheme performed worst in
all tested categories which indicates that it should be re-
placed by more usable schemes. Unlike proposals which
call for radically new ﬁngerprint representations, we
studied only textual ﬁngerprint representations, which
means that the results of our work can be directly applied
to various encryption applications with minimal changes
needed. Speciﬁcally, no new hardware or complex soft-
ware is required: applications merely need to replace the
strings they output to achieve a signiﬁcant improvement
in both attack-detection accuracy and usability.
There are various interesting areas of future work.
Firstly, we chose to study only a selected sample from the
design space of ﬁngerprint representations in a within-
subjects design, so we could facilitate a direct compar-
ison between the different classes of ﬁngerprints. Fur-
ther work exploring line breaks, font settings, dictionar-
ies, different attacker strengths, etc. will likely lead to
further improvement possibilities.
While this work shows that there are better ways to
represent key-ﬁngerprints than currently being used, it
does not explore what can be done to motivate more users
to actually compare the ﬁngerprints in the ﬁrst place.
Follow-up studies to research this important question are
naturally an interesting and vital area of research.
