User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Sending cron output to a file with a timestamp in its name I have a crontab like this on a LAMP setup:

0 0 * * * /some/path/to/a/file.php &gt; $HOME/cron.log 2&gt;&amp;1


This writes the output of the file to cron.log. However, when it runs again, it overwrites whatever was previously in the file.

How can I get cron to output to a file with a timestamp in its filename?

An example filename would be something like this: 2010-02-26-000000-cron.log

I don't really care about the format, as long as it has a timestamp of some kind.

Thanks in advance.

Assistant: Try:

0 0 * * * /some/path/to/a/file.php &gt; $HOME/`date +\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S`-cron.log 2&gt;&amp;1


Play around with the date format, if you like; just be sure to escape any % like \%, as above.
