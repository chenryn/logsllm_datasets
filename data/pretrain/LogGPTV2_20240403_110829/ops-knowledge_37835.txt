I am currently working on a framework installer script that needs to modify the user's `AppDelegate` file. Specifically, the script should inject a few lines of code at the beginning or end of the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` and `applicationWillTerminate` methods.

I have considered the following options:

1. **Parse the Source Code and Insert Lines:**
   - This approach involves parsing the `AppDelegate` source code and inserting the necessary lines at the correct positions.
   - **Pros:** Precise control over where the code is inserted.
   - **Cons:** Can be complex and error-prone, as it requires understanding and handling various coding styles and edge cases. This is almost equivalent to writing a compiler.

2. **Subclass the AppDelegate:**
   - Create a new subclass of `AppDelegate` and override the required methods.
   - **Pros:** Simpler and more robust.
   - **Cons:** Requires changes in the project's `main.m` file to use the new subclass.

3. **Use Objective-C Categories:**
   - Use categories to extend the `AppDelegate` class and add the necessary functionality.
   - **Pros:** Non-intrusive and can be added without modifying the existing `AppDelegate` file.
   - **Cons:** Limited to adding methods; cannot modify existing method implementations directly.

### Proposed Solution

One solution I am currently considering is to create a new `NewAppDelegate` class that subclasses the existing `AppDelegate`. The `NewAppDelegate` class will include the additional functionality and then call the super methods. The steps would be:

1. **Create `NewAppDelegate.m` and `NewAppDelegate.h` files** that subclass `AppDelegate`.
2 - **Override the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` and `applicationWillTerminate` methods** in `NewAppDelegate` to include the desired functionality and then call the super methods.
3. **Modify the `main.m` file** to instantiate `NewAppDelegate` instead of `AppDelegate`.

This approach seems relatively simple and robust. However, I am concerned about its compatibility with different projects. Will this work for most projects? Are there any potential issues or better alternatives I should consider?
