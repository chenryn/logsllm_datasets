### Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ

#### Issue with Environment File and Managed File Transfer Commands
If you encounter issues with your environment file and Managed File Transfer (MFT) commands, it may be due to invalid paths specified. Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the problem:

1. **Locate the Value of BFG_PROD:**
   - Open your environment file and find the value of `BFG_PROD`.

2. **Verify the Path:**
   - Enter OMVS and use the `ls -ltr` command to check the path.
   - For example, if `BFG_PROD` is `/mqm/V9R2M0/mqft`, run:
     ```sh
     ls -ltr /mqm/V9R2M0/mqft/bin/fteBatch
     ```
   - Ensure the file exists and that the batch job has read permission.

3. **Resolve Any Issues:**
   - If the JCL still fails to process correctly, create a new file in z/OS UNIX System Services, e.g., `myenv`.
   - Copy the information from the environment file into `myenv` and save it.
   - Use the command `chmod +x myenv` to make the file executable.
   - Run the command `. myenv` to check for any errors in the `myenv` file.
   - Correct any errors in both the `myenv` and environment files.

#### MFT Agent Process Disappearance
If an MFT agent process disappears without diagnostic information being logged, it might be due to how the agent was started. Here are the steps to check and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Log Files:**
   - Verify if the agent's log files indicate that the agent has been stopped.
   - Check if the agent lock file `agent.lck` still exists.

2. **Start the Agent with `nohup`:**
   - If you start the agent from a shell script, all child processes associated with the script are removed when the script completes.
   - To keep the agent running, prefix the `fteStartAgent` command with `nohup`:
     ```sh
     nohup fteStartAgent
     ```

#### Insecure MFT Agent or Logger Configuration
If an MFT process detects that a configuration file contains sensitive information and has system-wide read, write, or delete permissions, the process will fail to start. Hereâ€™s how to address this:

1. **Identify the Configuration File:**
   - Determine which configuration file is reported as insecure from the error message.

2. **Ensure Proper Permissions:**
   - Make sure the file access permissions match the required security settings. For more information, refer to "MFT permissions to access sensitive configuration information."

3. **Restart the Agent or Logger:**
   - Restart the agent or logger. For protocol bridge or Connect:Direct credentials files, wait for the next reload.

#### Example Error Messages
- **Database Logger Failure:**
  ```sh
  BFGDB0066E: The logger encountered a problem accessing its credentials file and will stop.
  Reported error: BFGNV0145E: The 'Everyone' group has access to the file 'C:\mqmftcredentials.xml'.
  ```

- **Protocol Bridge Agent Failure:**
  ```sh
  BFGIO0383E: The security permissions defined for credentials file 'C:\ProtocolBridgeCredentials.xml' do not meet the minimum requirements for a file of this type.
  Reported problem: BFGNV0145E: The 'Everyone' group has access to the file C:\ProtocolBridgeCredentials.xml'.
  ```

#### Message Buildup on SYSTEM.MANAGED.DURABLE Queues
If messages are building up on the `SYSTEM.MANAGED.DURABLE` queues, follow these steps:

1. **Start IBM MQ Explorer:**
   - Start the IBM MQ Explorer that uses the durable subscription. The MFT plug-in will consume the messages from the queue.

2. **Delete Messages Manually:**
   - Manually delete the messages from the queues.

3. **Avoid Future Buildup:**
   - Specify that the IBM MQ Explorer plug-in uses a non-durable subscription to the coordination queue manager.
   - Clear durable subscriptions from the coordination queue manager that are created by the IBM MQ Explorer MFT plugin.

#### Examining Messages Before Publication
To examine messages before publication, follow these steps:

1. **Disable Publish/Subscribe Engine:**
   - Use IBM MQ Explorer or MQSC commands to disable the publish/subscribe engine in the coordination queue manager.
   - IBM MQ Explorer:
     - Right-click the coordination queue manager and select Properties.
     - Select Publish/Subscribe and choose Compatibility mode.
   - MQSC:
     ```sh
     ALTER QMGR PSMODE(COMPAT)
     ```

2. **Send Another Message:**
   - Perform the MFT action that has publication problems.

3. **Browse the SYSTEM.FTE Queue:**
   - Use IBM MQ Explorer to browse the `SYSTEM.FTE` queue.
   - IBM MQ Explorer:
     - Expand the coordination queue manager and click Queues.
     - Right-click the `SYSTEM.FTE` queue and select Browse Messages.

4. **Re-enable Publish/Subscribe Engine:**
   - Re-enable the publish/subscribe engine in the coordination queue manager.
   - IBM MQ Explorer:
     - Right-click the coordination queue manager and select Properties.
     - Select Publish/Subscribe and choose Enabled mode.
   - MQSC:
     ```sh
     ALTER QMGR PSMODE(ENABLED)
     ```

#### Errors When Configuring Redistributable MFT Components
Common errors include:

- **Native Library for Windows:**
  - Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, and 2019 libraries.
  - Error: `BFGUB0070E: Internal error: Native library for platform Windows (architecture amd64) could not be loaded because mqmft (Not found in java.library.path).`

- **Bindings Mode Not Supported:**
  - The Redistributable MFT Agent can only connect to IBM MQ in client mode.
  - Error: `BFGCL0408E: Unable to obtain IBM MQ installation information for queue manager 'queue manager name'. Reason Cannot run program "../bin/dspmq": error=2, No such file or directory.`

#### Guidance for Using UAC and Virtual Store with MFT
User Account Control (UAC) and virtual store can affect MFT if the directory structure is changed using standard OS tools. To correct this:

1. **Rebuild Agent Structure:**
   - Use the `fteDeleteAgent` and `fteCreateAgent` commands to rebuild the agent structure.

2. **Remove Virtual Store Entries:**
   - Remove the IBM MQ entries in the virtual store of affected users.

#### Running MFT Agent or Logger as a Windows Service
To run an MFT agent or logger as a Windows service, ensure the following:

1. **Set BFG_DATA Environment Variable:**
   - Set the `BFG_DATA` environment variable in the system environment.

2. **Configure Logging:**
   - Use the `-sl` parameter to set the logging level (error, info, warn, debug).
   - Use the `-sj` parameter to specify the number of log files.

3. **Grant "Log on as a Service" Authority:**
   - Ensure the Windows account used to run the service has the "Log on as a service" right.

4. **Hide Windows Account Password:**
   - Run the command without specifying the `-sp` parameter.
   - Use the Windows Services tool to set the password.

#### Known Issues
- **JAVA_HOME System Environment Variable:**
  - Do not set the `JAVA_HOME` system environment variable for the agent or logger Windows Service.
