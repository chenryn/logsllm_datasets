### Man-in-the-Middle Attack on BLE: Impact of Key Parameters

#### Introduction
In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, the attacker can synchronize with either the Master, the Slave, or both simultaneously. This section describes the key parameters that significantly impact the success of such an attack: the Hop Interval, the payload size, and the distance between the attacker and the target Slave. The experiments conducted involved changing one parameter at a time and assessing its impact on the attack success by monitoring the number of injection attempts before a successful injection.

#### Experiment 1: Hop Interval
The first experiment focused on the Hop Interval parameter, which is directly involved in the estimation of the window widening as indicated in Equation 5. Theoretically, as the attack relies on a race condition based on this window, the injection should be more difficult when the Hop Interval value is lower.

- **Hop Interval Range**: According to the specification, the theoretical Hop Interval range is from 6 to 3200. However, we chose six different values from 25 to 150 for two main reasons:
  - **Worst Case Scenario**: We wanted to focus on the worst case of an injection attempt, which occurs when the injected frame collides with the legitimate frame. Since the injected frame used during this experiment was 22 bytes long over the air (i.e., 176 Î¼s of transmission time using the LE 1M physical layer), none of the window widening values calculated from the tested Hop Intervals allowed an injected frame to be entirely transmitted without a collision.
  - **Real-World Devices**: We wanted to conduct our experiment on real-life devices, most of which do not allow the use of high Hop Interval values due to the resulting connections being extremely unstable. We thus used the Hop Interval values supported by a connected lightbulb, which had the widest range of Hop Interval values among the commercial devices we found.

- **Experimental Setup**:
  - **Tools**: To precisely tune the Hop Interval parameter, we used a modified version of the open-source Mirage framework [11], [12] to simulate a Central device, leveraging its capability to access the HCI at a low level.
  - **Injection Frame**: We reversed the communication protocol built over GATT used by the lightbulb and selected a Write Request to turn the light off as our injection frame. The corresponding payload is 14 bytes long, making the entire frame 22 bytes long.
  - **Configuration**: The legitimate Peripheral and Central devices and the attacker were placed at the three vertices of an equilateral triangle with 2-meter edges. The Central initiated connections with the Peripheral repeatedly while the attacker synchronized with these connections and started the injection attack at a specific connection event. The experiment was conducted in a realistic environment, including several other BLE devices and multiple WiFi routers.

- **Results**:
  - The attack was successful for every tested connection. The variance of the number of unsuccessful attempts decreased quickly between 25 and 100 and stabilized afterward. The median value remained low, less than 4. These results show that the injection is always feasible even with small Hop Intervals, and the number of injection attempts required before a successful injection is generally low. The experiment confirms that the Hop Interval has a significant impact on the injection attack success, but the injection is more reliable with higher values.

#### Experiment 2: Payload Size
This experiment focused on the payload size of the injected frame to empirically confirm that injecting shorter frames increases the probability of success.

- **Experimental Setup**:
  - **Payload Sizes**: We selected four different payload sizes: 4, 9, 14, and 16 bytes, corresponding to frames that have observable effects on the target lightbulb (such as disconnecting it, turning it off, or changing its color).
  - **Fixed Hop Interval**: The experiment was repeated with a fixed Hop Interval of 75, iterating over the different payload sizes.

- **Results**:
  - Higher reliability was observed when the payload size decreased, consistent with the theory that a smaller portion of the injected frame collides. The number of injection attempts required before a successful injection remained very low (less than 3 for the median).

#### Experiment 3: Distance
The last experiment evaluated the impact of the distance between the attacker and the legitimate Peripheral.

- **Experimental Setup**:
  - **Distance Variations**: The lightbulb and a smartphone (as the legitimate Central) were placed within 2 meters of each other. The attacker's position was varied from 1 to 10 meters, as illustrated in Figure 8. This setup allowed us to evaluate the attack success when the attacker is closer to the Peripheral than the legitimate Central, at the same distance, and further away.
  - **Default Hop Interval**: The phone established 25 connections per tested distance using its default Hop Interval value of 36, which does not allow for collision-free transmissions.

- **Results**:
  - The results showed a significant impact of the distance on the reliability, with the variance increasing as the distance increased. The attacker had a higher probability of quickly performing a successful injection if closer to the target. Each tested connection led to a successful injection, even from 10 meters away, highlighting the practical feasibility of the attack even under adverse conditions.

- **Obstacle Test**:
  - We also tested the attack effectiveness behind a wall. The experimental setup was similar to the distance experiment, with the lightbulb and phone placed within 2 meters of each other in the same room, and the attacker located at four different positions behind a wall, from 2 to 8 meters from the Peripheral. The presence of a wall increased the number of injection attempts needed for a successful injection, but the attack was still successful in all tested cases.

#### Counter-Measures
The InjectaBLE attack exploits a vulnerability inherent to the BLE protocol specification. Several counter-measures could be investigated to limit the impact of the attack or to prevent or detect it:

1. **Communication Time Parameters**: Reducing the duration of the widening windows can mechanically reduce the possibility for an attacker to inject a frame at the right time. However, this requires changes to the BLE standard, which could affect the reliability and stability of communications.
2. **Encryption Mechanisms**: Activating the encryption mechanisms defined in the BLE specification can mitigate the attack. If all frames are correctly encrypted, an attacker will not be able to easily sniff the connection parameters and forge a valid frame. However, the majority of BLE communications today are poorly or not at all encrypted.
3. **Non-Intrusive Monitoring**: Defensive solutions, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) designed to monitor BLE Link Layer, can detect the presence of double frames (legitimate and attacker frames). Machine Learning-based solutions can also be effective in detecting behavioral anomalies and identifying Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

#### Conclusion
This paper demonstrated the feasibility of a new injection attack named InjectaBLE, targeting the BLE protocol. The attack significantly increases the attack surface of BLE communications by exploiting a vulnerability in the specification itself. We analyzed the impact of multiple factors on the attack success rate and demonstrated that this weakness could allow an attacker to perform critical attack scenarios, such as Slave hijacking or Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Activating the BLE native cryptographic mechanisms can effectively mitigate this attack, but the vast majority of commercial devices do not use encryption, making them vulnerable by design to InjectaBLE. The results highlight the need to generalize the systematic use of encryption in BLE communications. Future work will explore the practical feasibility of additional critical attack scenarios and the design of efficient defensive approaches.
