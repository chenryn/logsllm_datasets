Assistant: This log chunk shows that the Chrome.exe process is repeatedly opening and closing a connection to the proxy server proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070 via HTTPS. The amount of data sent and received varies, with the largest amount of data sent being 1.97 KB and the largest amount of data received being 250 KB. The lifetime of the connection is usually short, ranging from 00:01 to 00:04.
