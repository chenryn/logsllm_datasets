To enhance the user experience, we should implement an extension management interface similar to that of Atom. This interface will include a detailed list of installed and available extensions, as well as a progress indicator for downloads and updates. This will provide users with a clear and comprehensive overview of their extensions, making it easier to manage and maintain them.
