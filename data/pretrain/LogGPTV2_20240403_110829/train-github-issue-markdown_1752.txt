On 3/4/2015 on playpen, the following code:
    trait Foo {
        type A;
    }
    struct FooStruct;
    impl Foo for FooStruct {
        type A = ::A;
    }
    fn main() { }
...gives the following error:
    thread 'rustc' has overflowed its stack
    Illegal instruction (core dumped)
    playpen: application terminated with error code 132
This may be considered a duplicate of issue #20551, which notes a similar
problem with recursive trait bounds. I figured this may be unique given that
this involves a recursive associated type on a trait, rather than a recursive
trait itself.
