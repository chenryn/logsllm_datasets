### Problem
`plt.scatter` accepts both singular and plural forms of the `linewidth(s)` and
`edgecolor(s)` attributes. The plural forms are documented in the function
signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are
specified.
This adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their
users (cf. mwaskom/seaborn#2384).
### Proposed Solution
Small change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms
are specified.
Larger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the
kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they
could be deprecated, or at least "formally discouraged"?
### Additional context and prior art
Scatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too
much at times, ðŸ˜‰), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding.
On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and
short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor`and`ec`).
