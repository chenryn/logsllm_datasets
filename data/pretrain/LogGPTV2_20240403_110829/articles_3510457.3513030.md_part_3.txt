### Incident Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

#### Introduction
To predict and promptly detect the likely root cause of similar incidents, there is a need for "collective learning" from past incidents. This involves building a specialized Incident Search and Retrieval system based on Root Cause Analysis (RCA). The system takes an open-ended natural language query, retrieves the most similar past incidents, and presents key RCA information in a structured form. It also predicts the most likely root causes and resolutions for the queried symptom.

#### Methodology

**Incident Search and Retrieval:**
- **Objective:** Predict the root cause given a new symptom.
- **Approach:** 
  - **Retrieval:** The system retrieves the most similar past incidents based on the input symptom.
  - **Prediction:** It predicts the most likely root causes and resolutions using a link prediction task between the symptom and root-cause nodes, given the cluster graphs over symptoms and root-causes.
- **Empirical Results:** Training with knowledge of the symptom-root-cause connection from only 1% of incidents, our model achieves appreciable link prediction performance on test incidents.

**Data Augmentation:**
- During training, we add noisy edges between symptom and root-cause nodes by connecting their one-hop neighbors obtained from the respective cluster graphs. This helps in handling typographical errors, domain-specific abbreviations, and non-canonicalized wordings common in manual documentation.

**Training Data:**
- We train different models by varying how the training and validation data is selected.
  - **Edge Sampling:** Sample \( x\% \) of edges from all edges (true and noisy).
  - **Noisy Edge Sampling:** Sample \( x\% \) of noisy edges.
- For both setups, we build multiple models by varying \( x \in \{1\%, 2\%, 5\%, 10\%, 20\%\} \).

**Model:**
- We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [15] over the Symptom-Root-Cause bipartite graph.
- **Node Embeddings:** Symptom and root-cause node representations are computed as the average of GloVe-based token embeddings.
- **GCN Layers:** Separate GCN layers are added to the cluster graphs over symptoms and root-causes, updating node representations by message passing over immediate neighbors.
- **Training Objective:** For each training instance, we sample an edge \((v_s, v_r)\) and randomly sample \( n \) negative root causes. We compute the dot product similarity and train the neural network with a negative log-likelihood loss.

**Inference:**
- Given a symptom, we compute the dot product of the GCN-transformed representation with that of each root cause to predict the most likely root causes.

**Retrieval-based RCA:**
- **Using Incident Search:** Extracted root causes from the top-K retrieved incidents are merged into a single sentence, with span scores max-pooled and multiplicatively combined with the relevance score of the search result.
- **Using Incident Search and Causal Knowledge Graph:** The symptom extracted from the top-K retrieved search results is used to predict the top-K likely root causes using the Causal Knowledge Graph. The root cause prediction score is combined with the search result relevance score.

#### Evaluation and Analysis

**Neural Information Extraction:**
- **Human Validation:** A survey was conducted over domain experts and target end-users to validate the quality of topics, summaries, root causes, and resolutions extracted from PRB documents.
- **Topics:** 76% of the topics were found to be informative and useful.
- **Summaries:** Around 83% of summaries were satisfactorily informative.

**Neural Knowledge Mining:**
- **Clustering:** Unique descriptions of 1072 symptoms, 1915 root causes, and 2250 resolutions were clustered. t-SNE visualization showed well-separated and distinctive clusters.
- **Post-Incident Analysis:** The Causal Knowledge Graph built over the PRB repository can be instrumental in analyzing the categories of most commonly occurring symptoms, root causes, and resolutions.

**Incident Search and Retrieval-based RCA:**
- **Performance Evaluation:** The proposed ICA pipeline was evaluated for retrieving past incidents with similar symptoms and predicting likely root causes and resolutions.
- **Benchmarking:** An incident from a PRB document is considered the ongoing target incident, with its known information being the incident symptom. The remaining PRB documents are used for search and analysis.

#### Conclusion
The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility of using generic NLP models to mine PRB data for building a specialized tool like ICA. The empirical results, qualitative analysis, and expert-annotated validation show that the model performs remarkably well in extracting relevant root causes and resolutions, despite the long and unstructured nature of the documents.
