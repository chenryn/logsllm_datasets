It would help people to keep the font sizes on there site more consistent is
classes were also offered as the same sizes as the the headings.  
E.g. bits of text that semantically are not headings, but for styling purposes
should appear the same size, or are different levels in the document
structure.
The change would just be to add classes next to the headings in
/less/type.less
    h1, .h1 { font-size: (@font-size-base * 2.75); font-size: 4rem; } // ~38px
    h2, .h2 { font-size: (@font-size-base * 2.25); font-size: 3rem; } // ~32px
    h3, .h3 { font-size: (@font-size-base * 1.75); font-size: 2.5rem; } // ~24px
    h4, .h4 { font-size: (@font-size-base * 1.25); font-size: 2rem; } // ~18px
    h5, .h5 { font-size:  @font-size-base; font-size: 1.6rem; }
    h6, .h6 { font-size: (@font-size-base * 0.85); font-size: 1.2rem; } // ~12px
I can open the pull request, but mainly wondered about what naming style would
be best.
So i also found this issue from 6 months ago but its now closed, #5203  
But i don't think it was clear the first time with this issue that it could
help the consistency between font sizes on the site, and that it would not
only be useful for heading tags, but for any text on a page.
