### Enhanced Settings and Classifier Performance

In the enhanced settings, certain features become unavailable. Despite this, the Enterprise classifier maintains a similar performance to that observed under regular settings, achieving an AUC of 0.982. For instance, at a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.6%, the True Positive Rate (TPR) is 85.8%. This stability is attributed to the fact that the Enterprise classifier does not rely on subject-specific features. Although some sender profiling features cannot be constructed due to the unavailability of delivery path information in the enhanced setting, these are effectively complemented by other robust enterprise features.

For the All classifier, it is noteworthy that even with the reduced effectiveness of header features in the enhanced setting, the combined feature set still achieves a high prediction accuracy, with an AUC of 0.984. Specifically, at an FPR of 0.6%, the TPR is 95.2%.

### Detailed Performance Metrics

We further analyze the classifiers' performance at a discrimination threshold of 0.5, as shown in Table 7. The All classifier consistently outperforms the other classifiers across both regular and enhanced settings.

| **Setting** | **Classifier** | **Regular** | **Enhanced** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **TPR**     | Enterprise     | 0.957       | 0.888        |
|             | Header (baseline) | 0.952       | 0.954        |
|             | All            | 0.893       | 0.953        |
| **FPR**     | Enterprise     | 0.008       | 0.035        |
|             | Header (baseline) | 0.003       | 0.010        |
|             | All            | 0.100       | 0.005        |
| **AUC**     | Enterprise     | 0.974       | 0.926        |
|             | Header (baseline) | 0.974       | 0.972        |
|             | All            | 0.896       | 0.974        |

### CADUE Accuracy and Trade-offs

Using only header and enterprise features, CADUE's accuracy is slightly lower than techniques that utilize content features, reflecting the inherent challenges posed by end-to-end encryption (E2EE). In practice, CADUE can be tuned to balance true positives and false positives based on specific use cases. For example, under the regular setting, with an FPR of 0.02%, CADUE achieves a TPR of 87.3%. Even in the more restrictive enhanced setting, with the same low FPR, a TPR of 78.4% is achieved.

### Concept Drift

Concept drift refers to the phenomenon where data characteristics change over time, potentially degrading model performance. To evaluate this, we re-split our 25-day ground truth data into a training dataset and three 3-day testing epochs. The training dataset includes the first 14 days, and the testing epochs cover days 17-19, 20-22, and 23-25. Figure 7(c) shows the All classifier's performance degradation over time, which is marginal. Table 9 provides detailed metrics for the All classifier under different settings and epochs.

| **Epoch**   | **Setting**    | **Regular** | **Enhanced** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **17-19**   | TPR            | 0.987       | 0.977        |
|             | FPR            | 0.003       | 0.003        |
|             | AUC            | 0.992       | 0.987        |
| **20-22**   | TPR            | 0.965       | 0.964        |
|             | FPR            | 0.005       | 0.004        |
|             | AUC            | 0.980       | 0.980        |
| **23-25**   | TPR            | 0.913       | 0.919        |
|             | FPR            | 0.006       | 0.007        |
|             | AUC            | 0.953       | 0.956        |

### Handling Fresh Senders

Existing profiling-based approaches struggle with emails from new senders, as their profile features do not exist. Our approach, however, can still detect unwanted emails from new senders if they are sent to multiple internal users, leveraging enterprise graph features. If a new sender's email is sent to a single recipient, header features are used for detection. Our model achieves a high accuracy of 97.84% with an FPR of 2.0% for fresh emails.

### Comparison with Gascon et al.

Gascon et al. [18] focus on spearphishing emails, which are rare and account for a small portion of unwanted emails. None of the unwanted emails in our dataset were sent by previously known benign senders, making Gascon et al.'s approach ineffective. We evaluated their method on our benign dataset, resulting in a True Negative Rate (TNR) of 87.1% and an FPR of 12.9%, indicating that their approach is not fully content-agnostic and is affected by the unavailability of content-dependent features.

### Discussion and Limitations

#### Feature Robustness
Our approach uses header, sender profiling, and enterprise graph features. While header features can be manipulated by adversaries, sender profiling and enterprise features are robust against such manipulation. Our experiments show that our approach performs well with only sender profiling and enterprise features, making it robust against adversarial attacks.

#### Updates of Enterprise Graph
The dynamic nature of email communication requires regular retraining of the model. Our automated pipeline makes this efficient compared to deep learning models. Incremental updates to the enterprise graph can further improve performance. Regular retraining with a moving window of training data is recommended to maintain optimal performance without incurring heavy computational costs.

#### Fresh Senders
Our approach can detect unwanted emails from new senders with high accuracy, especially when sent to multiple recipients. However, for emails sent to a single recipient, more conservative decision-making (e.g., marking as suspicious) is recommended until more data is available.

### Conclusion

This paper presents techniques for detecting and filtering unwanted emails in an enterprise setting without access to email contents due to E2EE. By combining traditional header features with novel enterprise features, our content-agnostic classifier achieves high detection accuracy. Future work will explore the extraction of features from encrypted email contents to further enhance filtering accuracy.
