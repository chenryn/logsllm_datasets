User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题ssh into EC2 instance asks for password despite using a pem file I downloaded the pem file on my Windows machine and I am able to connect to my instance with the puttygen generated ppk file (which has a public and a private key in it).
I copied the pem file over onto a linux box and tried ssh -i pemfile.pem root@ec2instance.com -v but ssh is asking me for a password. The debug output (-v) is as follows:

debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Trying private key: /home/w/jpgate.pem
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
debug1: Next authentication method: password
root@ec2instance.com's password:


So I suppose I need a public key, right? How do I get the public key on linux?
Why does every tutorial tell that I only need to ssh -i key.pem root@instance.com?

Assistant: What kind of AMI / Linux distro are you using? 

Maybe logging in as root is not allowed. E. g. for an Amazon Linux AMI you will have to log in as ec2-user (not sure about the dash) and for Ubuntu AMIs it would be the ubuntu user.
