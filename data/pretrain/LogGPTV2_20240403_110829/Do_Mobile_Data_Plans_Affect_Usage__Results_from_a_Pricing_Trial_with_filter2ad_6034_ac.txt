# Mobile Data Plan Usage and Pricing: Results from a Trial

## 5.1 Do TIP Users Decrease Their Usage?

Most TIP (Time-Dependent Pricing) users reduce their data consumption to stay within their data caps. However, their Price-Awareness Ratio (PAR) increased from 1.88 to 2.67 during the trial.

**Figure 5a** illustrates TIP usage as a fraction of users’ data caps before and during the trial. Each circle represents a user, with the size proportional to the data cap. The dashed line indicates equal usage fractions before and during the trial. Generally, users' data usage is closer to their data caps during the trial. A few users with smaller 1GB caps used less of their data during the trial, while others used more. The data monitoring app ensured that users did not exceed their data caps.

We hypothesize that users reduce their monthly mobile data usage by shifting some of it to WiFi. Although we lack pre-trial WiFi statistics, 65.42% of TIP users' data was consumed over WiFi, compared to 55.39% for TDP (Traditional Data Plan) users. **Figure 5b** shows hourly mobile and WiFi usage patterns, indicating higher WiFi usage in the evening, especially among TIP users. This suggests that users may be substituting mobile data with WiFi to avoid hitting their data caps.

## 5.2 Do TDP Users Respond to Price Discounts?

TDP users increase their data usage more during discounted hours. ISPs can reduce their peak-to-average hourly traffic ratio by up to 31.4% through profit-maximizing prices.

**Price-Delay Tolerances:** During the trial, we offered four different prices: $10 (green), $15 (yellow), $18 (orange), and $20 (red) per GB. **Figure 6** shows the percentage change in usage at different hours for each price, compared to the same hour before the trial. While TIP usage changes were similar across all prices, TDP users showed more positive changes at lower prices ($10/GB) than at higher prices ($20/GB). This difference was more pronounced in the bottom 90th percentile (Fig. 6a) and top 10th percentile (Fig. 6b). TDP users distinguished between very low, moderate, and high prices, possibly using the colored price indicators. For all prices, TDP users had more positive usage changes than TIP users, likely because they saved money and felt they could use more data overall.

**Table 3** shows the estimated β and mean α parameters for the top five mobile apps, derived from fitting our waiting function model to the trial usage. Pandora has a lower β value, indicating higher delay tolerance, while email has the lowest delay tolerance (highest β value). Web browsing has the highest delay tolerance, suggesting users use it for non-urgent information. Surprisingly, email has the highest α value, likely due to increased downloads of attachments and images when prices are low.

**Maximizing ISP Profit:** Using the parameters in Table 3 and app usage fractions, we calculated the optimal time-dependent prices to maximize ISP profit for different marginal costs of exceeding capacity (γ). **Figure 7** shows the achieved PAR for various γ values, compared to pre-trial levels. Even at γ = 0, the PAR improves due to discounts in less congested hours, which induce increased usage and revenue. Thus, TDP can more effectively increase ISP profit and reduce network PAR than simple data caps.

## 6. Discussion and Conclusion

Pricing is a unique way to control network usage, relying on user attitudes and responses to incentives. We conducted three opinion surveys with TIP and TDP participants before, during, and after the trial. Most users, especially TDP users, expressed concern about TDP's complexity but preferred it to forced usage throttling. Combined with our measurement results, TDP can be more effective than capping or throttling, but must be implemented carefully to avoid undue complexity. One strategy is to use binary prices, e.g., $10/GB or $20/GB in any given hour.

Our work shows that users do change their behavior in response to pricing plans; TIP users reduce usage in response to data caps, possibly increasing WiFi usage. However, data caps alone are insufficient to prevent ISPs from over-provisioning networks based on peak usage. Time-dependent pricing allows ISPs to reduce their peak-to-average traffic ratio but requires more sophisticated understanding from users than monthly data caps. While customers are willing to shift their usage in response to time-dependent prices, full implementation and deployment of TDP will require more experimentation with a wider range of users.
