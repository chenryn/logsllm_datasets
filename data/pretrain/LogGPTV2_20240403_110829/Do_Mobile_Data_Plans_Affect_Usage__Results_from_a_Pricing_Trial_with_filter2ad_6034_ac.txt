5.1 Do TIP Users Decrease Their Usage?
Most TIP users decrease their usage in order to remain below their data caps.
However, their PAR increases to 2.67 from 1.88 before the trial.
Figure 5a shows TIP usage as a fraction of users’ data caps before and during
the trial. Each circle represents a user, and the circle size is proportional to the
user’s data cap. The dashed line represents equal usage fractions before and
during the trial. In general, users’ usage amounts are closer to their data cap
during the trial. A few users’ data points lie above the dashed line, indicating
that they used less of their data caps during the trial. These users, all with
relatively small 1GB caps, exceeded their data caps before the trial, but no
users did so during the trial. Other users’ data points lie below the dashed line,
indicating that they used more of their data caps during the trial than before.
The data monitoring app ensured that they did not have to worry about hitting
their data caps.
We conjecture that users reduce their monthly data usage by shifting some of
their usage to WiFi. While we do not have pre-trial WiFi statistics (WiFi data
was not collected by the network), 65.42 % of TIP users’ data was consumed
over WiFi, versus 55.39 % of TDP users’. Figure 5b shows the hourly mobile and
WiFi usage patterns for TIP and TDP users. WiFi is used more than mobile in
the evening, and spikes at these times for TIP users. This spike may indicate
unusually large WiFi usage due to users’ not using mobile data.
5.2 Do TDP Users Respond to Price Discounts?
TDP users increase their usage more in discounted hours. ISPs’ proﬁt-maximizing
prices can decrease their peak-to-average hourly traﬃc ratio by up to 31.4 %.
Price-delay tolerances: We oﬀered four diﬀerent prices during the trial:
$10 (green price indicator), $15 (yellow), $18 (orange), and $20 (red) per GB.
Figure 6 shows the % change in usage in diﬀerent hours for each price, compared
to usage in the same hour (e.g., 12 to 1am) for the same user before the trial.
While the TIP usage changes are similar for all prices, TDP users have more
positive changes for $10/GB versus $20/GB, in both the bottom 90th (Fig. 6a)

and top 10th (Fig. 6b) percentiles of usage changes. The diﬀerence is less pro-
nounced for the intermediate $15/GB and $18/GB prices, but is still apparent,
especially around the 80th percentile. TDP users thus distinguished between
very low, moderate, and high prices, perhaps using the colored price indicators.
For all prices, TDP users had more positive usage changes than TIP users, likely
because they were saving money on some of their usage and felt they could
use more data overall. TDP changes above the 97th percentile are less price-
dependent, but these are likely outliers occurring when usage increases during
hours of very small pre-trial usage.
As explained in Sect. 3.3, we compare the delay tolerances for diﬀerent apps
by ﬁtting our waiting function model to the trial usage. Table 3 shows the result-
ing β parameters and average α parameters over time for the top ﬁve mobile
apps (Table 2). We see that while Pandora has a lower value of β, corresponding
to higher delay tolerance, email has the lowest delay tolerance (highest value
of β). Web browsing, however, has the highest delay tolerance, perhaps reﬂect-
ing users’ use of the web for looking up non-urgent information. Surprisingly,
email has the highest α value (i.e., increase at low-price times independent of
shifting), likely because users downloaded more email attachments and images
when the price was low.
Maximizing ISP proﬁt: Finally, we use the parameters in Table 3 and app
usage fractions in Table 2 to calculate the optimal time-dependent prices oﬀered
by the ISP, which maximize (1) for diﬀerent marginal costs of exceeding capac-
ity (γ). To measure TDP’s eﬀect on usage peaks, we calculate the PAR with

these optimized prices. Figure 7 shows the achieved PAR for a range of γ val-
ues, compared to that before the trial. Even when γ = 0, the PAR improves
due to discounts in less congested hours, which induce an increase in usage and
revenue. Thus, TDP can more eﬀectively increase ISP proﬁt and reduce the
network’s PAR than can simple data caps.
6 Discussion and Conclusion
Pricing is a unique way of controlling network usage in that it explicitly relies on
user attitudes and responses to incentives. Thus, to supplement our measurement
results, we conducted three opinion surveys with the TIP and TDP participants
before, during, and after the trial.4 As part of the survey, users were asked their
opinions on TDP’s viability. Most users–especially TDP users in the mid-trial
survey–expressed some concern over TDP’s possible complexity. However, nearly
all users preferred TDP to forced usage throttling in the mid- and post-trial
surveys. Combined with our measurement results, we see that TDP can be more
eﬀective than capping or throttling usage, but must be implemented carefully
to avoid undue complexity. One possible strategy is to use binary prices, e.g.,
charging either $10/GB or $20/GB in any given hour.
Our work shows that users do change their behavior in response to changes
in their pricing plans; in particular, TIP users reduce their usage in response to
data caps, possibly increasing their WiFi usage. However, data caps are not suf-
ﬁcient to prevent ISPs’ need to over-provision networks according to their peak
usage. Time-dependent pricing allows ISPs to reduce their peak-to-average traf-
ﬁc ratio, yet requires more sophisticated understanding from users than monthly
data caps. While customers are willing to shift their usage in response to time-
dependent prices, a full implementation and deployment of TDP will require
more experimentation with a wider range of users.
