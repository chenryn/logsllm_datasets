I am attempting to integrate `react-datepicker` into one of my React components. However, when I import the CSS file as shown below, I encounter an error.

```javascript
import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css';
```

The error message is as follows:

```
Error in react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css
Module parse failed: /path/to/my/project/folder/node_modules/react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css 
Unexpected token (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
| .react-datepicker-popper[data-placement^="bottom"] .react-datepicker__triangle, .react-datepicker-popper[data-placement^="top"] .react-datepicker__triangle, .react-datepicker__year-read-view--down-arrow,
| .react-datepicker__month-read-view--down-arrow {
| margin-left: -8px;
```
