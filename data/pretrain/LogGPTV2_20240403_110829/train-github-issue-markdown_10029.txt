I'm trying to use react-datepicker in one of my react components. When I
import the `CSS` file like mentioned below, I get an error.
`import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css'`
The error I get is,
    Error in react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css
    Module parse failed: /path/to/my/project/folder/node_modules/react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css 
    Unexpected token (1:0) You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type. | .react-datepicker-popper[data-placement^="bottom"] .react-datepicker__triangle, .react-datepicker-popper[data-placement^="top"] .react-datepicker__triangle, .react-datepicker__year-read-view--down-arrow, | .react-datepicker__month-read-view--down-arrow { | margin-left: -8px;
