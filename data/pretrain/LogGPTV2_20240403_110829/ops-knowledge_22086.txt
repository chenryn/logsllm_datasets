Question: A system analyst is diagnosing SELinux policy violations on an Android test device. After ensuring that SELinux is in the correct mode, what steps should they take next to effectively identify and resolve the policy violations?
"A": "Examine the SELinux output to `dmesg` and refine settings in permissive mode before switching to enforcing mode.",
"B": "Execute the `androidboot.selinux=permissive` command to disable SELinux enforcement and observe changes in system behavior.",
"C": "Use `simpleperf` to capture the call chain and diagnose the denial without checking SELinux logs for errors.",
"D": "Run `audit2allow` directly on the event logs without examining the specific denial messages or contexts."
Answer: A
