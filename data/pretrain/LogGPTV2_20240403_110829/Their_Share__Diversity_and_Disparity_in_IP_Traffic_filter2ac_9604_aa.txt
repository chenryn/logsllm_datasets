## Abstract
The need to service highly diverse populations while addressing significant disparities affects all aspects of network operation, including planning, routing, engineering, security, and accounting. We analyze diversity and disparity from the perspective of distinguishing between "mice" and "elephants" in IP traffic aggregated by routes, such as destination Autonomous Systems (ASes). Our goal is to find a concise quantifier of size disparity for IP addresses, prefixes, policy atoms, and ASes, similar to the well-known 80/20 rule (e.g., 80% of volume in 20% of sources). We define "crossover" as the fraction \( c \) of total volume contributed by the complementary fraction \( 1 - c \) of large objects.

By studying sources and sinks at two Tier 1 backbones and one university, we find that splits of 90/10 and 95/5 are common in IP traffic. We compare the crossover diversity to common analytic models for size distributions, such as Pareto/Zipf. We find that AS traffic volumes (by byte) are top-heavy and can only be approximated by a Pareto distribution with \( \alpha = 0.5 \). Empirical distributions often resemble a Weibull distribution with shape parameters between 0.2 and 0.3. Additionally, fewer than 20 ASes send or receive 50% of all traffic in both backbone samples, a disparity that can simplify traffic engineering. Our results are valuable for developers of traffic models, generators, and simulators, as well as for router testers and operators of high-speed networks.

## 1. Introduction
The lack of a predictive relationship between the number (cardinality) and the combined size (volume) of a collection of objects is a recurring problem in Internet data analysis. The volume of a natural category, such as users, instants, and networks, can be unevenly distributed among individual objects. For example, while the Internet architecture does not have a single point of failure, 80-90% of routes use the top 20 providers. Similarly, 80 source ASes (among several thousand observed) can contribute 95% of the traffic on a link.

In this paper, we study the mismatch between number and size in terms of diversity and disparity. Diversity refers to the presence of a large number of distinct objects (e.g., many users sharing a link). Many objects have a natural size measure, such as bytes per transfer, customers per provider, and visits per website. Disparity, on the other hand, is the concentration of a size measure in a small subset of objects. For example, a bursty flow may accumulate most of its duration in lulls. In extreme cases of disparity, a giant cluster forms, where the aggregate size is comparable to the total volume. This is seen with TCP in the IP protocol space, with popular operating systems, and recently with P2P applications in some networks.

Mathematically, diversity and disparity are present when the counting measure (such as the number of addresses) and the size measure (e.g., traffic per address) are close to being mutually disjoint (singular), i.e., supported by non-intersecting sets. Many Internet measures of interest are disjoint (e.g., in the case of lulls and bursts, most bytes are transferred in negligible total time). The ubiquity of disjoint measures makes the comparison of IP objects challenging.

Neither diversity nor disparity is inherently good or bad; their impact depends on the context. Motivations to study disparity include offsetting its negative impacts (such as lack of resilience) and developing ways to manage total volume via control of a few contributors. Data reduction is another motivation, e.g., frequent objects are assigned shorter bit strings (as in Huffman encoding). Indeed, a valid motto of Internet science is: Find Disparity in Diversity.

Size disparity is often referred to as the "mice-elephants" phenomenon. It was observed early in Internet history that Internet traffic displays favoritism at any given aggregation, i.e., many small contributors and a few large ones. Researchers have described duration 'elephants' (long-lasting flows) and bitrate or burst 'elephants'. We focus on volume elephants due to ISPs' need for a metric for pricing and the bitrate limitations of many links.

Comparing diversity and disparity across multiple datasets, directions, measures, percentile levels, and source/destination granularities can easily result in an explosion of numbers. We propose a concise characteristic of disparity that we call "crossover." We define it as the fraction \( 1 - c \) of volume accumulated in the fraction \( c \) of top objects. We justify this metric in Section 3. The object size at the crossover \( x_c \) serves as a cutoff between the mice and elephant classes. We study crossovers both empirically and analytically and believe they are potentially as useful as, and more descriptive than, the 95th percentile currently used in many MIBs and autogenerated reporting software.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses motivations, and in Section 3, we compute crossovers for uniform, exponential, and Pareto distributions. We assess their validity as models for aggregated traffic by comparing their crossovers with observed values. Specifically, we find that uniform or exponential distributions have crossovers under 70/30. The Pareto density \( Cx^{-\alpha-1} \), \( 1 \leq x \leq N \), approaches the observed splits of 90/10 for \( \alpha = -1 \) (Zipf distribution) and \( N = 10^{10} \). Splits of 95/5 with realistic values of \( N \) can only be obtained for \( \alpha \) in the range 0.2 to 0.3.
