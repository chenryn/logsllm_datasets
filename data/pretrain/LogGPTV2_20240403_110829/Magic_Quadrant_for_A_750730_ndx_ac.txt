#### Sumo Logic

**Strengths:**
- **Telemetry Deployment Flexibility:** Sumo Logic supports a wide range of agents for data collection, depending on the type of telemetry. It fully supports OpenTelemetry, which can gather data from applications, operating systems (OSs), databases, and end users. Additionally, it has a proprietary agent that can collect telemetry from similar sources.
- **Cloud Integration:** Sumo Logic offers robust native integrations with cloud service providers (CSPs). It can ingest and analyze data from multiple clouds, including AWS, Azure, GCP, and private clouds.

**Cautions:**
- **Lack of STM Capability:** Sumo Logic does not have a built-in Synthetic Transaction Monitoring (STM) capability. Instead, it integrates with Catchpoint’s Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) solution to monitor end-user digital experiences.
- **Code-Level Analytics and Dashboard Coverage:** Sumo Logic’s application tracing capabilities are less mature compared to some competitors. Drilling down into business KPIs, session data, and traces requires manual configuration. The analytics and dashboard features also require some manual setup.
- **SaaS-Only Deployment:** Sumo Logic only provides a SaaS product, with no on-premises deployment option. This may not be suitable for clients with strict data sovereignty regulations, although customers can choose to store their data in the AWS region of their choice.

#### VMware (Tanzu Observability)

VMware is classified as a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability platform, Tanzu Observability (TO) by Wavefront, is more focused on observability than traditional APM. It has been used by enterprises, startups, and service providers as a time-series-based monitoring platform. TO now includes the ability to ingest and analyze OpenTelemetry-distributed traces, addressing a broader set of APM needs. VMware's operations are geographically diverse, serving enterprises and service providers of all sizes. The product roadmap includes support for log ingestion, adding DEM through Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetics via integration with Catchpoint, and expanding the use of AI/ML.

**Strengths:**
- **Scalable Ingestion:** Tanzu Observability supports metrics-intensive workloads, capable of handling millions of data points per second. This capacity-based model is appealing to organizations sensitive to node-based licensing.
- **Agent Independence:** VMware recommends using the open-source InfluxData Telegraf agent for collecting telemetry, which is then passed to Tanzu Observability via its proxy, which also acts as an OpenTelemetry Receiver. This flexible ingestion via standard interfaces simplifies deployment and reduces time to value.
- **Operational Expansion:** VMware plans to double Tanzu Observability’s geographic footprint in 2022, expanding from four to eight countries across North America, EMEA, and APAC regions.

**Cautions:**
- **Lack of Native DEM:** VMware relies on an external company (Catchpoint) for DEM, limiting its control over innovation in this area. While OpenTelemetry-native applications can send DEM telemetry, the number of such applications is limited. VMware plans to release RUM and synthetic monitoring capabilities in 2023, but requiring a subscription to an additional service provider may discourage potential customers.
- **Platform Bundling:** Although Tanzu Observability is available as a stand-alone product, its roadmap and go-to-market strategy depend heavily on VMware’s priorities. Despite synergies with VMware’s Kubernetes-based Tanzu product family, the product’s capabilities extend beyond Kubernetes monitoring.
- **Visibility:** Tanzu Observability is mentioned in a small percentage of Gartner client inquiries. Given the competitive nature of the APM and observability market, it will be challenging for Tanzu Observability to achieve the visibility necessary for success.

### Vendors Added and Dropped

We review and adjust our inclusion criteria for Magic Quadrants as markets change. As a result, the mix of vendors in any Magic Quadrant may change over time. A vendor's appearance or absence in a Magic Quadrant does not necessarily indicate a change in our opinion of that vendor. It may reflect changes in the market, evaluation criteria, or the vendor's focus.

**Added:**
- Amazon Web Services
- Honeycomb
- Logz.io
- Sumo Logic
- VMware (TO)

**Dropped:**
- Bonree did not meet the inclusion criteria.
- Tingyun did not meet the inclusion criteria.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

For Gartner clients, Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities research identifies and analyzes the most relevant providers and their products in a market. Gartner typically includes up to 20 providers, but this limit may be extended in specific cases to ensure research value. To qualify for inclusion, providers must:

- Demonstrate the capability to observe an application’s complete transaction behavior through proprietary agent technology and/or distributed tracing.
- Automatically collect data from at least three modern application frameworks, such as Java Virtual Machines (JVMs), .NET CLRs, PHP, Ruby, Node.js, AngularJS, Python, and Go.
- Show at least three of the following seven technical capabilities:
  - Automated discovery and mapping of application and infrastructure components (including cloud services).
  - Monitoring of applications running on mobile (native and browser) and desktop browsers.
  - Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on business outcomes.
  - Native integration capabilities with automation and service management tools, as well as public cloud providers (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitoring, Google Cloud Operations).
  - Analysis of business KPIs and user journeys (e.g., login to check-out).
  - Interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (traces, metrics, logs) to detect “unknown unknowns.”
  - Application security functionality, delivered via a common agent or framework for APM.

**Business (Nonfunctional) Criteria:**
- Rank among the top 20 organizations in the market momentum index defined by Gartner for this Magic Quadrant.
- Generate at least $75 million in annual GAAP revenue from software-based APM products, or at least $10 million in annual revenue with a growth rate of at least 25%.
- Have at least 50 paying, production (non-beta-test) customers in each of two or more geographic regions (APAC, EMEA, Latin America, or North America) for a minimum of 100 customers, excluding sales to Managed Service Providers (MSPs).

### Honorable Mention

Gartner is tracking more than 40 vendors in the APM and Observability market. This research focuses on 19 vendors that met our inclusion criteria. However, the exclusion of a particular vendor does not mean it should not be considered or that it lacks viable capabilities for specific customer needs.

**LogicMonitor:**
- Known primarily as a provider of SaaS-based IT Infrastructure Management (ITIM), LogicMonitor has expanded into observability through acquisitions and engineering. It recently introduced APM based on OpenTelemetry and improved log analysis. However, LogicMonitor did not meet the inclusion criteria for this research.

### Evaluation Criteria

**Ability to Execute:**
Gartner analysts evaluate providers on the quality and efficacy of processes, systems, methods, or procedures that enable competitive, efficient, and effective performance, positively affecting revenue, retention, and reputation. The criteria include:
