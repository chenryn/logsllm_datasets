■	Telemetry deployment flexibility: Sumo Logic supports many different agents for 	collecting data, based on the telemetry type. Sumo Logic has full support for 	OpenTelemetry, which can collect telemetry from applications, OSs, databases and 	end users. It also has a proprietary agent that can collect telemetry fromapplications, OSs, databases and end users.
■	Cloud Integration: Sumo Logic has strong native integrations with cloud service 	providers (CSPs). It can ingest and analyze data from multiple clouds, including 	AWS, Azure, GCP and private clouds.
Cautions
■	Lack of an STM capability: Sumo Logic does not have STM. It integrates with 	Catchpoint’s DEM solution to monitor the end user’s digital experience.■	Code-level analytics and dashboard coverage: Sumo Logic’s application tracing 	lacks the maturity of some competitors’ offerings. Drill-down into business KPIs, 	session data and traces requires manual configuration. Analytics and dashboard 	features also require some manual efforts.■	SaaS-only deployment: Sumo Logic only offers a SaaS product, and no on-premises 	deployment option is available. This means it may not be suitable for clients that 	have regulations around data sovereignty, although customers may keep data in the 	AWS region of their choice.
VMware (TO)VMware is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability platform, Tanzu Observability (TO) by Wavefront, is more observability than APM. It has been used by enterprises, startups and service providers as a time-series-based monitoring platform, adding the capability to ingest and analyze OpenTelemetry-distributed traces into TO-enabled VMware. This addresses a broader set of customer APM needs. Its operations are geographically diverse, and its clients tend to be enterprises and service providers of all sizes. The product roadmap includes support for ingesting and analyzing logs; adding DEM through RUM and synthetics, which are being collected via integration withCatchpoint; and expanding use of AI/ML.
Strengths
■	Scalable ingestion: Support for metrics-intensive workloads — into the millions of 	data points per second — has long been one of Tanzu Observability’s differentiators. 	This model is being carried over to traces and logs. Organizations sensitive to node-	based licensing may find such a capacity-based model appealing.

■	Agent independence: Rather than create its own agent, VMware recommends the use 	of the open-source InfluxData Telegraf agent to collect telemetry that is passed to 	Tanzu Observability via its proxy, which also acts as an OpenTelemetry Receiver. 	Flexible ingestion via standard interfaces makes the product easier to deploy and 	reduces time to value.■	Operational expansion: VMware plans to double Tanzu Observability’s geographic 	footprint in 2022, from four countries in the North America, EMEA and the APAC 	regions to eight.
Cautions
■	Lack of native DEM: VMware relies on an external company (Catchpoint) for DEM, 	which limits its ability to control innovation in this area. Alternatively, customers may 	pass DEM data into VMware via the agent and proxy. Although OpenTelemetry-	native applications can send DEM telemetry that way, the number of theseapplications is limited. VMware plans to release RUM and synthetic monitoring 	capability in 2023. However, requiring a subscription to an additional service provider 	may discourage prospective customers.■	Platform bundling: Although Tanzu Observability is available and is often purchased 	as a stand-alone product, as a business unit of VMware, the Tanzu Observability 	product roadmap and GTM strategy depends heavily on the priorities of its parent 	company. Despite substantial synergies with VMware’s Kubernetes-based Tanzu 	product family, the product’s capabilities go well beyond serving as a monitoring 	solution for Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications.■	Visibility: Tanzu Observability comes up in a small percentage of Gartner client 	inquiries. The APM and observability market is quite competitive, especially lately.
Given the size and scale of the VMware portfolio, it will be difficult for Tanzu Observability to achieve the visibility necessary to be successful in it.
Vendors Added and DroppedWe review and adjust our inclusion criteria for Magic Quadrants as markets change. As a result of these adjustments, the mix of vendors in any Magic Quadrant may change over time. A vendor's appearance in a Magic Quadrant one year and not the next does not necessarily indicate that we have changed our opinion of that vendor. It may be a reflection of a change in the market and, therefore, changed evaluation criteria, or of a change of focus by that vendor.Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 23 of 37

For Gartner clients, Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities research identifies, then analyzes the most relevant providers and their products in a market. Gartner uses by default an upper limit of 20 providers to support the identification of the most relevant providers in a market. On some specific occasions, the upper limit may be extended by Methodologies, where the intended research value to our clients might otherwise be diminished. The inclusion criteria represent the specific attributes that analysts believe are necessary for inclusion in this research.To qualify for inclusion, providers must demonstrate the capability to observe an application’s complete transaction behavior, through proprietary agent technology and/or distributed tracing. The vendor must demonstrate the capability to automatically collect data from at least three modern application frameworks:

Honorable MentionHonorable Mention
Gartner is tracking more than 40 vendors in the APM and Observability market. This research focuses on 19 vendors that met our inclusion criteria. However, the exclusion of a particular vendor does not necessarily mean that it should not be considered, or that it does not have viability capabilities that may be a fit for a customer’s unique requirements.LogicMonitor: More widely known as a provider of SaaS-based ITIM, LogicMonitor has expanded into observability through a combination of acquisition and engineering. It has recently introduced APM based on OpenTelemetry, as well as improved log analysis. LogicMonitor did not meet the inclusion criteria for this research.
