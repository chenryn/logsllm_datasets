This code:
    mod A {
        struct X;
        mod B {
            use A::X;
            pub fn foo(_: X) {}
        }
    }
Triggers:
    src\main.rs:6:23: 6:24 error: private type in exported type signature
    src\main.rs:6         pub fn foo(_: X) {}
The `foo` function is only visible to `A` and `B`, and `X` is also visible to
both `A` and `B`, so I don't see why this would be forbidden.
This was introduced in the `rustc 1.0.0-nightly (f4e0ce66a 2015-03-19) (built
2015-03-20)` nightly. With the 2015-03-17, this works.
