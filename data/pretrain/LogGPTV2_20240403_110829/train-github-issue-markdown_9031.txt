Here is the illustrative example:
    fn foo() {
        { bar('}'); }
        { bar(']'); }
        { bar(')'); }
    }
The characters within `'` characters above are incorrectly treated by
`src/etc/rust-mode.el` as closing the opening paren of the invocation of
`bar`. This confuses Emacs in a number of ways (e.g. obviously paren matching;
but also the auto-indentation gets confused too, which is more annoying).
