### OAuth 2.0 Profiles

#### Grant Types and Token Endpoint Authentication Methods
- **grant_types**: `"authorization_code"`
- **token_endpoint_auth_method**: `"client_secret_basic"`

Let's examine the definition of each parameter:

- **client_id**: A unique identifier generated for the client.
- **client_secret**: The secret key corresponding to the `client_id`. This is optional. For public clients, a `client_secret` is not required.
- **client_id_issued_at**: The number of seconds since January 1, 1970, when the `client_id` was issued.
- **client_secret_expires_at**: The number of seconds since January 1, 1970, when the `client_secret` expires, or `0` if it does not expire.
- **redirect_uris**: A list of accepted redirect URIs.
- **token_endpoint_auth_method**: The accepted authentication method for the token endpoint.

#### Dynamic Client Registration
The Dynamic Client Registration OAuth 2.0 profile is particularly useful in mobile applications. In traditional setups, mobile client applications secured with OAuth have a fixed `client_id` and `client_secret` embedded within the application. These credentials are the same for all installations of a given application. If the `client_secret` is compromised, it affects all installations, and malicious actors can develop rogue client applications using the stolen keys. These rogue applications can generate excessive traffic on the server, potentially causing a denial of service attack.

With dynamic client registration, each installation of the application can generate its own `client_id` and `client_secret` during the installation process by communicating with the authorization server's registration endpoint. This reduces the risk of widespread compromise if a single set of credentials is exposed.

#### Token Revocation Profile
OAuth 2.0 allows two parties to perform token revocation: the resource owner and the client. The Token Revocation OAuth 2.0 profile addresses the latter, introducing a standard token-revoke endpoint at the authorization server.

To revoke an access token or a refresh token, the client must notify the revoke endpoint. For example, in October 2013, Buffer (a social media management service) was attacked. Buffer used OAuth to access user profiles on Facebook and Twitter. Upon detecting the attack, Buffer revoked all its access keys from these platforms, preventing further unauthorized access.

The client initiates the token revocation request by authenticating to the authorization server, typically via HTTP Basic authentication (using the `client_id` and `client_secret`), mutual TLS, or another supported mechanism. The request includes the token to be revoked and a `token_type_hint` indicating whether it is an `access_token` or `refresh_token`.

**Sample Request:**
```http
POST /revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSdadsdI9iuiaHk99kjkh
token=dsd0lkjkkljkkllkdsdds&token_type_hint=access_token
```

Upon receiving this request, the authorization server validates the client credentials and revokes the specified token. If the token is a `refresh_token`, the authorization server invalidates all associated `access_tokens`. The server then responds with an HTTP 200 status code upon successful revocation.

#### Summary
- **OAuth 2.0 Profiles**: Built on top of the core framework, these profiles enhance security for enterprise-grade deployments.
- **Grant Types and Token Types**: OAuth 2.0 introduces extension points via grant types and token types.
- **Token Introspection Profile**: Introduces a standard API at the authorization server, allowing the resource server to retrieve token metadata.
- **Chain Grant Type Profile**: Enables the first resource server to exchange an OAuth access token for a new one to communicate with a second resource server.
- **Token Exchange Proposal**: A draft proposal under the IETF working group, offering improvements over the Chain Grant Type.
- **Dynamic Client Registration Profile**: Exposes an endpoint for on-the-fly client registrations.
- **Token Revocation Profile**: Provides a standard token-revoke endpoint for revoking access and refresh tokens.

### Accessing APIs via Native Mobile Apps

#### Mobile Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single sign-on (SSO) enhances user experience by reducing the need for multiple logins. In a corporate environment, SSO allows employees to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials, improving productivity and reducing password-related frustrations.

#### Login Methods for Native Apps
- **Direct Credentials**: Users provide their credentials directly to the native app. This approach assumes the app is trusted and is not suitable for third-party identity providers. It also poses a phishing risk.
- **WebView**: Embeds a browser within the native app, providing a seamless login experience but lacking SSO capabilities and posing security risks.
- **System Browser**: Spawns the system browser for login, ensuring better security and enabling SSO. The system browser manages a single web session, allowing users to log in once and access multiple apps.

#### Using OAuth 2.0 in Native Mobile Apps
1. **App Registration**: Register the application with the identity provider or OAuth 2.0 authorization server to obtain a `client_id`. Use the authorization code grant type without a `client_secret`.
2. **Web Controller**: Use `SFSafariViewController` for iOS or `Chrome Custom Tabs` for Android to embed the system browser within the app.
3. **Custom URL Scheme**: Register a custom URL scheme with the mobile operating system to handle redirects from the system browser.
4. **Login Flow**: Initiate the login process by spinning up the system browser and following the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type.
5. **Redirect URI**: After authentication, the browser redirects to the registered redirect URI, invoking the native app.
6. **Token Exchange**: The native app exchanges the authorization code for an access token at the token endpoint.
7. **API Access**: The native app uses the access token to access protected APIs.

#### Inter-app Communication
- **Private URI Schemes**: Use a custom URL scheme to pass control between the system browser and the native app. Follow RFC 7595 guidelines to avoid collisions.
- **Claimed HTTPS URI Scheme**: Claim an HTTPS domain for inter-app communication, providing better security through identity verification.
- **Loopback Interface**: Listen on a specific port on the device, allowing the native app to act as a simple web server. Ensure the port is available and not in use by other apps.

#### Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)
PKCE, defined in RFC 7636, mitigates code interception attacks by adding a layer of security to the authorization code flow. It is essential when using private URI schemes to prevent unauthorized access.

By following these best practices, developers can secure native mobile applications and provide a seamless and secure user experience.
