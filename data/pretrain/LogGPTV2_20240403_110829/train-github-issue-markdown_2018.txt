During the ongoing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap series in the front-end course, I noticed two instances of semicolons on the screen. To provide a reference, I have randomly selected the following two waypoints along with their respective screenshots:

1. **Waypoint: House Our Page Within a Bootstrap .container-fluid Div**

I am curious about the presence of these semicolons. While they do not pose any obstacles during the course, I believe they might cause confusion for beginners.
