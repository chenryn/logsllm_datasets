I found the 2 semi colons on the screen during the on going html & css and
bootstrap series in the front end course.
I have randomly selected the below 2 waypoint links and the screenshots for
the reference:-

Wondering about these semi colons. Of course, they aren't any obstacles during
the course. Thought it might a confusion for a newbie.
