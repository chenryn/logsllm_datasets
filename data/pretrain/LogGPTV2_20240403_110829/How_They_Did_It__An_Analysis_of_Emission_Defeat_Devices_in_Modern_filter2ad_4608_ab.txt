semantics are explained in the ECU documentation. We have
found no evidence that automobile manufacturers write any of
the code running on the ECU. All code we analyzed in this
work was documented in documents copyrighted by Bosch
and identiﬁed automakers as the intended customers.
E. Related Work
Unfortunately, there is little technical documentation about
defeat devices that is publicly available. Domke and Lange
were the ﬁrst to present several technical insights into the
defeat device used in a Volkswagen Sharan [9], [10]. We lever-
age these analysis results and adopted a similar methodology
to identify defeat devices. The New York Attorney General’s
compaint against Volkswagen AG [15] contains several general
insights into defeat devices, but does not provide any technical
details. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is currently being
investigated in Europe [17] and to the best of our knowledge,
we are the ﬁrst to document how this defeat device is imple-
mented.
III. DATASET
In this paper, we focus on the EDC17 ECU manufactured by
Bosch. This diesel engine ECU was used in the cars implicated
in the Volkswagen emission scandal as well as the Fiat 500X.
We rely on three data sources for our analysis of ECUs and
affected vehicles which we describe below.
A. Function Sheets
Function sheets (called Funktionsrahmen in German) doc-
ument the functional behavior of a particular release of the
ECU ﬁrmware. The function sheets describe each software
functional unit of the ECU using a formal block diagram lan-
guage that precisely speciﬁes its input/output behavior, along
with some additional explanatory text. The block diagram and
text documentation also names the variables and calibration
constants used by the functional unit. Car makers tune the
behavior of the ECU by changing these calibration constants.
In the Bosch function sheets, scalar calibration constants are
C sufﬁx, one-dimensional array constants
identiﬁed by the
MAP
by the
sufﬁx. Further, curve deﬁnitions use the sufﬁx
CA sufﬁx, and higher-dimensional arrays by the
CUR.

Function sheets are generally not available to the public,
however, many make their way into the automobile perfor-
mance tuning community. All of the function sheets used in
this work have been obtained from such tuner sites. All ﬁgures
throughout the paper are derived from these function sheets
that are already publicly available.
Authenticity. Since we did not obtain the function sheets
directly from the ECU manufacturer (Bosch), we cannot
be absolutely certain of their authenticity. Nevertheless, all
function sheets used in this work bear a “Robert Bosch GmbH”
copyright and show no evidence of alteration by a third party.
Indeed, we have not encountered any function sheets that
show any signs of content tampering in the wild. We have
also explicitly veriﬁed that key functional elements, like the
Volkswagen “acoustic condition” described in Section IV-A,
match the code in the ﬁrmware.
B. A2L and OLS Files
The automotive industry uses the ASAM MCD-2 MC [1]
ﬁle format, commonly called A2L, to communicate elements
of a ﬁrmware image that a car manufacturer must modify in
the calibration process. Generally speaking, an .a2l ﬁle is
comparable to a .map or .pdb ﬁle used by developers on the
Linux or Windows platform, respectively. While all of these
ﬁle types map debugging symbols to concrete addresses, .a2l
ﬁles can also give contextual information beyond mere symbol
names. The format is developed to “support . . . automotive-
speciﬁc processes and working methods” [1]. Consequently,
additional metadata used to describe an address (i. e., an ECU
variable) may include axis descriptions for lookup tables,
information about the byte order, or unit conversion formulas.
An example is given in Listing 1 in the Appendix.
Given that .a2l ﬁles contain lots of details and insights
into a given ECU, they are typically only available for people
working on engine development, calibration, and maintenance.
However, car tuning enthusiasts also regularly get hold of these
ﬁles and trade them at online forums. In order to understand
the inner workings of certain ECU ﬁrmware images in more
detail, we obtained access to such ﬁles. When we were not
able to obtain a .a2l ﬁle for a given ﬁrmware image, we
focused on binary code only and leveraged insights gained
from similar ECUs to bootstrap our analysis.
In some cases, we relied on OLS ﬁles, an application format
used by the WinOLS software used to change conﬁguration
values in ﬁrmware. The OLS format contains both a ﬁrmware
image and elements of the A2L ﬁle annotating calibration
constants.
Authenticity. As with function sheets, we did not obtain A2L
ﬁles used in this work from Bosch or the car maker, and
so cannot guarantee their authenticity with absolute certainty.
Each A2L ﬁle is paired with a speciﬁc ﬁrmware image;
we conﬁrmed their match before using the A2L to extract
values from the image. We used A2L to identify variables and
constants in code extracted from the ﬁrmware. Examining the
context in which a value thus served as a kind of sanity check.
C. Firmware images
We also obtained ﬁrmware images from various sources.
Similar to .a2l ﬁles, ﬁrmware images are also circulated
in the car tuning community. We obtained several images
from the tuner community. We also obtained images from the
erWin portal (“electronic repair and workshop information”),
a platform operated by Volkswagen that provides access to
ofﬁcial ﬁrmware images for car repair shops. The portal
provides archives containing ﬁrmware updates up to a certain
date. Every image is named after its software part number and
revision, allowing us to uniquely identify it. The timestamp is
roughly equivalent to the release date of the ﬁrmware.
Unfortunately, the images contain no additional metadata
such as the actual model in which the ﬁrmware is deployed.
We used online portals offered by aftermarket automobile part
vendors to determine which vehicles a ﬁrmware image was
used on.
Authenticity. Firmware data for VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda
is obtained from the erWin portal, operated by Volkswa-
gen. The newest image is dated October 11, 2016. We also
obtained Volkswagen group images dated 2009–2010 from
various online sources. We only included images for which
Freigabeschein (street release certiﬁcation) documents allowed
us to obtain information about both release date and car model.
We obtained the Fiat 500X OLS ﬁle from a tuning site. It
was sold to us as an original (unmodiﬁed) image. Our main
ﬁndings based on this OLS ﬁle align with the test results of
the German KBA [22].
IV. DEFEAT DEVICES
A defeat device is a mechanism that causes a vehicle to
behave differently during an emission test than on the road.1
Conceptually, a defeat device has two components:
◦ Monitor. Determine if observed conditions rule out an
emission test, and
◦ Modify. Alter vehicle behavior when not under test.
Defeat devices rely on any number of external or internal
variables to detect that a test is taking place. From 1991
to 1995, for example, General Motors used the fact that air
conditioning was turned on in its Cadillac automobiles to rule
out a test cycle—at the time, emission testing was done with
air conditioning turned off—making the air-fuel mixture richer
to address an engine stalling problem, but also exceeding CO
emission limits [14]. General Motors was ﬁned $11 million
and forced to recall all affected vehicles.
As the Cadillac example suggests, the monitoring element
of a defeat device does not need to be perfect, so long as
1More precisely, the US Code of Federal Regulations deﬁnes a defeat device
as “an auxiliary emission control device (AECD) that reduces the effectiveness
of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be
expected to be encountered in normal vehicle operation and use, unless:
(1) Such conditions are substantially included in the Federal emission test
procedure; (2) The need for the AECD is justiﬁed in terms of protecting the
vehicle against damage or accident; (3) The AECD does not go beyond the
requirements of engine starting; or (4) The AECD applies only for emergency
vehicles . . . ” (40 CFR § 86.1803-01). European regulations follow a very
similar deﬁnition.

its error is one-sided. Like the Cadillac device, the defeat
devices we found assume that the vehicle is under test unless
some internal or external variable allows it to rule out an
ongoing test. Then, when the monitoring element signals that
the observed variables are not consistent with any known test
cycle, the vehicle can switch to an operating regime favored by
the manufacturer for real driving rather than the clean regime
necessary to pass the emission test.
In the remainder of this section, we describe the defeat
devices used by Volkswagen and Fiat to circumvent emission
testing and their effect on vehicle behavior. Our description is
based on function sheets for the ECU, reverse engineering of
the ﬁrmware, and publicly available information, notably the
Complaint ﬁled by the State of New York against Volkswagen
and its US subsidiaries [15].
A. The Volkswagen Device: Test Detection
The Volkswagen defeat device is a continually evolving
family of devices. All instances are organized around a single
condition monitoring block that determines if the vehicle
is undergoing testing and points throughout emission-related
ECU modules where the result of this determination can affect
the behavior of the module. The monitoring element of the
Volkswagen defeat device is encapsulated in a function block
that computes the status of the kundenspeziﬁsche Akustikbe-
dingung, which translates to “customer-speciﬁc acoustic con-
dition.” (Here, customer refers to the automaker, namely,
Volkswagen.) The outcome of the computation is represented
by the signal/variable InjCrv stNsCharCor (stNsCharCor
for short). This signal is then used at many points in the
ECU to alter the behavior of the engine. Figure 2 shows the
logic block responsible for computing the acoustic condition.
(The Figure is taken from the function reference sheet created
by Bosch.) The value stNsCharCor = 0 means that the
ECU considers itself to be in normal driving mode, while
stNsCharCor = 1 indicates testing (emmissions-compliant)
mode.
Activating conditions. The state of the acoustic condition is
stored in the top ﬂip-ﬂop in the ﬁgure . The set signal to the
ﬂip-ﬂop is true if all of a set of ﬁve conditions are true. These
conditions are shown in Table I. Note that the last condition,
engine starting, is only true when the engine is starting and is
false during normal operations. If the engine runs in normal
mode (i. e., has not recently been started), has exceeded a
velocity of, e. g., 9.5 km/h at some point, and pressure
and temperature match the aforementioned boundaries, the
function proceeds with the actual cycle checking. Otherwise,
the engine stays in the same mode. The effect of this is that
the acoustic condition can only be set if coolant temperature,
fuel temperature, oil temperature, and atmospheric pressure are
within the prescribed limits when the car starts . If any of
the four parameters is outside the required range, an ongoing
emissions test is ruled out and the acoustic condition is never
activated. However, we note that these conditions are easily
satisﬁed in both testing and real-world scenarios.
If the acoustic condition is set at startup, it may be canceled
by meeting several conditions that rule out a test. We call
these the deactivating conditions. If any of these conditions
are met, the inner ﬂip-ﬂop is set . The output of the inner
ﬂip-ﬂop asserts the reset signal of the outer ﬂip-ﬂop, setting
the acoustic condition variable stNsCharCor to zero. There
are four deactivating conditions any one of which, if true,
sets the inner ﬂip-ﬂop that in turn sets stNsCharCor to zero,
indicating the vehicle is in normal driving mode.
Deactivating conditions. There are four deactivating con-
ditions . The ﬁrst deactivates the acoustic condition if
the engine has started and a conﬁgurable time period
InjCrv tiNsAppVal C has elapsed since the accelera-
tor pedal position ﬁrst exceeded a conﬁgurable threshold
InjCrv rNsAppVal C. The second deactivates the acoustic
condition if the engine revolution counter exceeds a conﬁg-
urable threshold InjCrv ctNsStrtExtd C. The third de-
activation condition, if the acoustic condition is inhibited, is
never triggered.
Until about May 2007,
there were only three deactiva-
tion conditions, as described above. Of the ﬁrmware im-
ages available to us, the fourth condition ﬁrst appears in a
ﬁrmware image dated May 2007 for EDC17CP04 P 617. It
starts by computing a time and distance measurement. The
time measurement, call it t, is computed by measuring the
time since the vehicle ﬁrst exceeded a conﬁgurable velocity
InjCrv vThres C. The distance measurement is the dis-
tance in the current driving cycle, call it d.
Test cycle curves. The acoustic condition logic computes a
pair of points dlower and dupper using two linearly interpolated
curves. These curves, which deﬁne a function of t using a
small number of points, are conﬁgurable by the manufacturer.
In this case, there are seven pairs of curves, giving seven pairs
of values dlower and dupper computed for the current value t.
If d is ever less than dlower or greater than dupper, the ﬂip-
ﬂop corresponding to the pair of curves is set and remains set
indeﬁnitely .
The output of this ﬂip-ﬂop indicates that the vehicle has
strayed outside the prescribed time-distance proﬁle deﬁned by
the pair of curves. Hence, the curves describe an upper and
lower bound on the covered distance. The ﬂip-ﬂop allows the
logic to remember this, and at any given time, the state of
the ﬂip-ﬂops indicate whether the vehicle has so far stayed
within the prescribed time-distance proﬁle deﬁned by the pair
of curves. If all seven ﬂip-ﬂops are set, then the vehicle has
strayed outside the proﬁle of each of the curves at least once

since start. If this happens, the acoustic condition is canceled.
In the ﬁrmware we examined, these curves are used to
deﬁne the precise time-distance proﬁle of known emission
tests. In general, we note that the number of proﬁles has been
increasing with time. As shown in Table II, the number of
curves checked has increased from 0 in EDC17CP04 P 531
to 7 in EDC17CP44 P 859.
Figure 3 shows several curve pairs found in the ﬁrmware
of an EDC17C54 ECU (software part number 03L906012,
revision 7444; remaining curves found in Figure 14 in the
Appendix). The area outside of the upper and lower boundaries
dlower and dupper as deﬁned by curves is shaded. If the com-
puted time and distance value (t, d) ever enters this gray area,
the test is considered to be ruled out, and the corresponding
ﬂip-ﬂop is set. In addition to the boundaries, we have plotted
the test cycles of known emission tests given in Table IV. Test
cycles matching the proﬁle are shown using heavy lines; all
others using light lines. As our results show, several of the
conﬁgured boundaries match a known test cycle quite closely.
In particular, proﬁle 1 matches the FTP-75 test cycle to within
4.2 km and proﬁle 5 the HWFET test cycle to within 16.1 km
(not fully shown in the ﬁgure).
