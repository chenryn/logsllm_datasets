Figure 7. The topology of host mobility by
country or region (e.g., “EU”), for top 500
AS pairs.
Third, a closer look at the AS topology of host mo-
bility in the U.S. shows the existence of “hub” ASes that
are connected to many smaller “leaf” ASes. The former
are commonly associated with DSL broadband Internet
services, while the latter include institutional and cor-
porate networks. This star topology could result from
clients’ commuting patterns between home and work.
Finally, in addition to the source and sink domains,
we are also interested in how far the hosts roam, i.e.,
how many ASes they travel through. Figure 8 plots the
distribution of the number of ASes traveled by each host,
with the Y-axis in log scale. The large majority (90%)
of cookies are associated with only two domains.
These observations, based on aggregate information
across the 7.9 million traveling hosts in the Search
dataset, reﬂect general mobility patterns at a large scale.
In the following, we investigate speciﬁc activities that
fall outside this norm, including those that may involve

5.2 Identifying Virtual Client Travel
Although the majority of traveling cookies corre-
spond to physical host mobility, such as those associ-
ated with cellular networks, some switch between do-
mains faster than seemingly possible for physical travel.
Consecutively appearing from different ASes within a
matter of minutes, the rapid movement of these cook-
ies suggests the presence of some form of virtual client
travel.
5.2.1 VPN Trafﬁc Patterns
For the large majority of hosts that travel rapidly across
only two or three domains, they likely have used VPNs
or proxies. Virtual private networks (VPNs) allow traf-
ﬁc to be privately tunneled between two machines that
are not in the same subnet. Creating an overlay net-
work of clients that belong to the same organization,
they are commonly used to provide corporate resources
to remote employees. From the perspective of a web
server, a user connecting to her company network from
a DSL line at home can generate multiple requests with
the same cookie, though they appear from two domains.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd a total 960,885 (12%) mobile
cookies that travel between only two ASes, and that ap-
pear at the ASes consecutively within a short interval
(i.e., 10 minutes). We call such cookies VPN-style cook-
ies. Table 7 lists the top ﬁve AS pairs with the highest
number of these cookies, which include institutional and
corporate networks, e.g., City University of New York,
NTT, and KDDI Corporation. VPN-style cookies com-
prise around 60% of all traveling cookies between a cor-
porate network and a DSL broadband service provider.
This observation indicates that VPNs can be a major ex-
planation for host mobility.

5.2.2 The Use of Anonymous Routing
Examining the tail of the distribution in Figure 8, we
also ﬁnd a small fraction (0.02%) of cookies that mi-
grate across more than 10 different domains. Stopping
in each AS only for short durations, they do not return to
a previously visited domain. Focusing on this behavior,
we identify 309 cookies that travel across more than 10
ASes, and where the time between consecutive “jumps”
to different ASes is less than 10 minutes (which is the
default time to use a Tor circuit for new application con-
nections). Compared to the AS peering relationship in
Section 5.1, there does not appear to be any clear delin-
eation of geographical regions.
The top ASes in this case are dominated by cable net-
works, with the previously top cellular networks disap-
pearing completely from the list. Some university net-
works ranked signiﬁcantly higher than before (AS 111,
associated with Boston University, is on the path of 9%
of these cookies). One explanation for the behavior of
these cookies is the use of anonymous routing systems,
such as Tor [37]. For a user that routes her trafﬁc in this
manner, if her trafﬁc exits from different nodes in the
mixing network, the same cookie may appear at differ-
ent domains.
We obtained a list of active Tor nodes [8], including,
for each node, its IP address, country, ISP, and whether
it is an exit node. Among the 309 wandering cookies,
60 of them traverse through at least one Tor node, and
142 of them traverse through at least one AS that is also
shared by a Tor node. We also examine ASes since some
Tor nodes may already be assigned different IPs at the
time of our lookup. Figure 9 plots the distribution of

the percentage of Tor IP addresses or ASes that a cookie
traverses. All of the cookies spend at least 12% of their
time at a Tor IP address, with the maximum being 83%.
Using the Tor network hides the network origin of a
user, addressing one aspect of online anonymity. How-
ever, the use of cookies may still reveal user activity pat-
terns and potentially user network origins, e.g., if a user
does not clear cookies prior to using the Tor network.
To mitigate such privacy threats, users can install Tor-
button [7] to manage their identifying information, for
example.
5.3 Detecting Cookie(cid:173)Forwarding Attacks
Based on the host mobility patterns derived from our
analysis, we launch an investigation into abnormal user
activities that include 28,208 unique user accounts, pro-
vided by the Hotmail web-mail service. These events
are sampled over a 24-hour window in November 2010.
In each event, a user submitted requests (e.g., check-
ing new emails, listing contacts) from an IP range that
was different from the one she used to log into her Hot-
mail account. One would imagine that this behavior can
be attributed to the use of cellular networks, VPNs, or
proxies. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd many users exhibit quite
different traveling patterns than those we learned in Sec-
tions 5.1 and 5.2.
5.3.1 Detection Methodology
We ﬁnd two distinct patterns in these events that differ
from those of general mobile hosts:
• One-third of the ASes associated with these events
are exclusively sinks or sources. This is in con-
trast to normal host mobility, where the direction
of travel is largely bi-directional. Table 8 lists the
dominant sink ASes.
• Among the AS pairs with the largest number of
these abnormal events, seven out of the top ten do
not appear at all among those associated with nor-
mal hosts. These AS pairs are listed in Table 9.

events.
Combining these two observations, we ﬁnd that the
dominant sinks in Table 8 signiﬁcantly overlap with the
sink ASes in Table 9. They share the common source AS
30736, located in Denmark. Upon examination, we ﬁnd
that there is a single IP address generating login events
for a large number of users, who then submit subsequent
requests from multiple ASes in the U.S., violating the
geo-locality travel pattern observed in Figure 7 as well.
We ﬁnd that the user login IDs associated with this
particular source IP address contain more suspicious
patterns. In particular, they are groups of bot-user ac-
counts all registered on the same day in November 2010,
with the same user age, location information (country,
state), and scripted naming patterns. Among the top ﬁve
dominantly sink ASes, four of them are used by these
bot groups to submit requests.

Table 10. Statistics for detected bot(cid:173)user
groups.
By examining all the sink ASes with source AS
30736 in these events, we ﬁnd a total of 9 bot-user
groups, corresponding to 9 sink ASes geographically
distributed over the U.S. The activities between some of
these ASes are subtle, and would not have been detected
without leveraging the normal host mobility patterns de-
scribed in Section 5.1.
5.3.2 Cookie-Forwarding Bot Users
Table 10 lists the statistics for the 9 detected bot-user
groups. Each of these groups includes around 190
users. A different /24 subnet is associated with each user
group that submit requests without explicit login activ-
ities from the same subnet. For each /24, the sink IP
rotates among 10 to 14 addresses.
From a more recent user login dataset collected by
Hotmail in January 2011, we ﬁnd over 75,000 email
accounts associated with the suspicious source IP ad-
dress in Denmark, all exhibiting similar patterns to the 9
groups we discovered. Manual investigation by Hotmail
shows that these accounts were used by attackers for the
purpose of receiving and testing spam. After these ac-
counts are logged into from one machine (i.e., one IP ad-
dress), their cookies are forwarded to multiple locations
so that further requests can be submitted in a distributed
fashion during the validity period of the cookies, which
is 24 hours in our case.
There are at least two possible explanations for such
malicious cookie-forwarding activities.
First, some
web-mail providers identify an account as suspicious if
it performs logins from multiple geographic locations
within a short time interval. By forwarding cookies to
other locations through a private communication chan-
nel, attackers can successfully ofﬂoad the requests to
distributed hosts without them performing explicit user
logins, hence reducing the likelihood of detection. Sec-
ond, as a preparation step in launching session-hijacking
attacks on real user accounts (e.g., [6]), attackers may
be testing the effectiveness of forwarding cookies via
stealthy communication channels.
Although the user accounts we identiﬁed were all
newly created, it is possible that attackers can employ
hijacked cookies stolen from actual users and forward
them to botnet hosts in the future. Understanding nor-
mal host mobility patterns can help detect such stealthy
attacks.
6 Related Work
Many efforts on tracking hosts focus on identify-
ing speciﬁc hardware characteristics, such as radio fre-
quency [23, 34, 18] or driver [21].
Identiﬁers such
as network names or the IP addresses of frequently
accessed services also enable host ﬁngerprinting [32].
However, these approaches require the observer to be in
close physical proximity to the target host.
Remote host ﬁngerprinting can leverage packet-level
information to identify the differences in software sys-
tems [2, 4, 5] or hardware devices [28]. Other works
on tracking web clients require probing hosts’ system
conﬁgurations [20] or the installation order of browser
plug-ins [31]. Persistent browser cookies [3, 36] have
also been proposed; these systems store several copies
of a cookie in different locations and formats, so that
they cannot be removed by standard methods.
Compared with these efforts, our work focuses on
studying the effectiveness and implications of track-
ing hosts using existing identiﬁers, without requiring
new information or probes. Although the issue of pri-
vacy leakage has been repeatedly discussed, e.g., per-
sonally identiﬁable information in online social net-
works [29, 30], there has been limited study using large-
scale datasets. Our work uses month-long datasets from
a large search engine and a popular email provider to
quantify the amount of host-identifying information re-
vealed by a variety of common identiﬁers. To the best
of our knowledge, we are also the ﬁrst to demonstrate
applications of host tracking to analyze cookie churn in
web services and to detect suspicious cookie-forwarding
activities.
Apart from its privacy implications, understanding
cookie churn is an important topic for estimating web
