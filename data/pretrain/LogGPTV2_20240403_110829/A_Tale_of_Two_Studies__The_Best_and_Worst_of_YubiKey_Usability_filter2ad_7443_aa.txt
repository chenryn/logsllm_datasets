## Abstract
Two-factor authentication (2FA) significantly enhances the security of password-based authentication. Recently, there has been increased interest in Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keysâ€”small hardware devices that require users to press a button for authentication. To evaluate the usability of these security keys in non-enterprise settings, we conducted two user studies with the YubiKey, a popular U2F security key. The first study involved 31 participants configuring Windows, Google, and Facebook accounts with a YubiKey, revealing significant issues with setup instructions and workflow, including users locking themselves out or mistakenly believing they had successfully enabled 2FA. In contrast, the second study, involving 25 participants using YubiKeys in their daily lives over four weeks, showed generally positive experiences. Conducting both a laboratory and longitudinal study provided insights into the usability of security keys that would not have been evident from either study alone. Based on our findings, we recommend standardizing the setup process, enabling verification of success, integrating with operating systems, allowing shared accounts, and preventing lockouts.

## I. Introduction
Passwords remain the most common form of user authentication on the web, despite numerous proposals to replace them [1]. However, passwords come with significant security and usability issues, such as users struggling to create and remember strong passwords [3, 4], developers failing to properly secure stored passwords [5, 6], and the prevalence of password phishing [7].

To address these limitations, many advocate for two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires users to prove possession of a trusted hardware device in addition to their password. Even if an attacker steals a user's password, they cannot impersonate the user without the second factor.

The FIDO Alliance and their Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol [9] are at the forefront of this push. U2F, supported by 1.5 billion people [10], is implemented by security keys. These hardware devices authenticate users after they press a button, which tests for user presence and prevents malware from using the key surreptitiously. Security keys typically connect via USB, but can also use wireless protocols like NFC or Bluetooth.

While U2F security keys are designed to be easy to adopt and use, protecting against phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks, previous studies [8] have focused on enterprise environments. This paper presents the first studies exploring the usability of security keys for non-enterprise users. We used three Yubico security keys (YubiKey 4, YubiKey NEO, and YubiKey Nano) in our studies, as they closely resemble those in Lang et al.'s study and have received significant media and industry attention.

We conducted a laboratory study with 31 participants, who set up Google, Facebook, and Windows 10 accounts with a YubiKey. This study revealed significant impediments for novice users, leading to a generally negative view of YubiKeys. We then conducted a longitudinal study with 25 participants, who used YubiKeys in their daily lives for four weeks. With setup assistance, participants were very positive about YubiKeys and 2FA.

Our contributions include:
1. **First user studies for unassisted, non-enterprise users:** Our work shows that the non-enterprise setup experience was worse than the enterprise experience described by Lang et al. [8], but day-to-day usability was comparable.
2. **Separate study of 2FA setup and daily use:** Prior work has either focused on one phase or combined both. Our study reveals unique usability challenges in each phase.
3. **Recommendations for usability improvements:** Based on our observations and participant feedback, we offer suggestions to improve the usability of security keys and 2FA, such as providing more active forms of documentation.

## II. Related Work
Prior research on the usability of two-factor authentication includes laboratory studies, longitudinal studies, and surveys.

### A. Laboratory Studies
- **Piazzalunga et al. [11]:** Compared smart cards and USB security tokens, finding USB tokens faster and less error-prone.
- **Weir et al. [12, 13]:** Studied hardware code generators and SMS-based 2FA, with participants preferring push-button and SMS systems.
- **Gunson et al. [14]:** Evaluated 2FA in telephone banking, noting low usability and user concerns about carrying physical tokens.
- **Trewin et al. [15]:** Compared biometric authentication methods, with participants favoring facial recognition and gesture-based methods.
- **Karapanos et al. [16]:** Proposed Sound-Proof, a 2FA method based on ambient sound, found to be more usable than Google Authenticator.

### B. Longitudinal Studies
- **Lang et al. [8]:** Studied hardware security keys in an enterprise setting, reporting improved authentication times and reduced support incidents.
- **Krol et al. [18]:** Conducted a study with 21 individuals using various 2FA methods, finding a strong dislike for specialized hardware and inconsistent terminology.

### C. Surveys
- **De Cristofaro et al. [19]:** Surveyed online users, finding high ratings for all 2FA systems, though results were not fine-grained enough for USB tokens.
- **Strouble et al. [21]:** Surveyed military and civilian Air Force members, noting lower usability scores for Common Access Cards (CACs) and productivity losses due to forgotten CACs.

### D. Methodology
- **Egelman et al. [22]:** Interviewed smartphone users about phone locking practices, using inductive coding to identify rational choices based on faulty assumptions. Our study employed a similar methodology, analyzing qualitative data and offering recommendations.

## III. System Overview
U2F security keys are hardware tokens used for 2FA. They improve security by:
1. **Preventing password-only access:** Security keys prevent attackers from accessing accounts even if they steal the password.
2. **Resisting man-in-the-middle attacks:** Unlike one-time passcodes (OTPs), security keys use a challenge-response scheme.
3. **Protecting against malware:** Unlike smart cards, security keys require user acknowledgment for each authentication attempt.

Our studies focused on Google, Facebook, and Windows 10, using YubiKey 4, YubiKey NEO, and YubiKey Nano. Each device has a capacitive sensor for authentication.

### A. Google
Google provides a guided wizard to enable 2FA and set up security keys. The wizard requires users to first set up 2FA using a phone number for account recovery. After registering the phone number, users can add a security key. Future authentications involve entering the username and password, inserting the security key, and tapping the button.

### B. Facebook
Facebook also provides a wizard for setting up security keys, but it does not guide users through enabling 2FA. Users must navigate to the "Two-Factor Authentication" menu and set up a recovery 2FA scheme (SMS or Facebook authenticator app) before adding a security key. Once set up, the authentication process is similar to Google's.

### C. Windows 10
Windows 10 does not natively support U2F, but Yubico offers the Windows Logon Authorization Tool and YubiKey for Windows Hello. Setup involves ensuring a local Windows account, installing the YubiKey Personalization Tool, adding an HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response secret, installing the .NET 3.5 framework, and registering the YubiKey. If the user restarts the computer between steps, they may become locked out. After setup, users select their account, enter their password, and tap the YubiKey if it is already inserted.
