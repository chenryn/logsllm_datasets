User: I am using pip and trying to install a python module called pyodbc which has some dependencies on non-python libraries like unixodbc-dev, unixodbc-bin, unixodbc. I cannot install these dependencies system wide at the moment, as I am only playing, so I have installed them in a non-standard location. How do I tell pip where to look for these dependencies ? More exactly, how do I pass information through pip of include dirs (gcc -I) and library dirs (gcc -L -l) to be used when building the pyodbc extension ?
Assistant: Just in case it's of help to somebody, I still could not find a way to do it through pip, so ended up simply downloading the package and doing through its 'setup.py'. Also switched to what seems an easier to install API called 'pymssql'.
