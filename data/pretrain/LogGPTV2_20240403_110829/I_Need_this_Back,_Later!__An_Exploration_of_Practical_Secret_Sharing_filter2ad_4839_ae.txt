### Account Recovery via Trusted Contacts

Brainard et al. [2] propose a method where an account holder appoints trusted contacts (condants) who can authorize a password reset if the account holder loses their password. To regain access, the account holder contacts these condants by phone or email to request a recovery code. The condants then access the recovery subsystem to obtain and provide the recovery codes to the account holder. With a sufficient number of recovery codes, the account holder can regain access to their account and set a new password.

In our research, the recovery codes can be compared to key shares. However, in our setting, the entire process is largely unmediated by an electronic system, unlike the social authentication process which is typically mediated by the website providing the recovery subsystem. Additionally, the information needed for condants to access the recovery subsystem is provided electronically, making it vulnerable to online hacking attacks. To mitigate this, we focus on tangible shares instead of electronic sharing.

### Risk Assessment

Several studies have investigated and modeled attacks against social authentication schemes [6–8]. The work by Schechter et al. [9] is particularly relevant. They conducted two social engineering experiments: one measuring the efficacy of attacks based on forged emails, and another measuring the success of attacks using phone calls from members of the victim’s social circle. Email attacks were less effective, but 45% of the phone call attacks succeeded. Similar risks exist in our setting. We hypothesize that tangible shares may reduce the convenience and likelihood of misguided information sharing, though verifying this is part of our future work. Our initial focus is on how well share retrieval works.

### Secret Sharing in Practice

Secret sharing has been implemented in various practical processes and applications. For example, it is used to protect DNSSEC root keys, and the YubiHSM5 hardware security module supports secret sharing as a key backup mechanism. Even blockchain-based secret sharing platforms exist. These implementations are often targeted at expert users, while our research explores how casual users might interact with the concept.

### Conclusions

Secret sharing can effectively protect the availability and confidentiality of digital data. Managing shares offline increases the cost and difficulty of attacks, likely deterring many adversaries. Our findings indicate that offline share management, using paper or key tags, is slow but practical. There was no significant difference in retrieval success, suggesting that other parameters, such as the cost and ease of producing tangibles, could be optimized. Paper appears to be a favorable option.

Setting \( k = 3 \) and \( n = 5 \) seems sufficient to ensure most keys are recoverable, but a larger \( n \) is recommended for a safer margin. A concerning number of condants knew enough other condants to collaboratively recover the shared key. Increasing \( n \) is advisable, though it carries the risk of soliciting collaboration, which could be mitigated by instructing condants to notify the user via a predefined channel (email or phone) of any attempt to initiate share retrieval, even if it appears to be initiated by the user. These instructions can be printed on the shares to remind condants of this security precaution.

Future work could include automating the process of helping users decide whom to distribute shares to, possibly based on their social networks, to reduce the likelihood of multiple condants collaborating. Other research could explore how to best support users in producing and recovering keys from shares.
