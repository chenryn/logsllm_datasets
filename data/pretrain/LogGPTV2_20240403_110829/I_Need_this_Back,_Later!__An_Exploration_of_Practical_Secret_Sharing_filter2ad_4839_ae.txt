and Brainard et al. [2]. The general idea is that an account holder ap-
points condants who can authorize a password reset if the account
holder looses his password. In order to regain access, the account
holder contacts his condants by voice or by mail and requests
a recovery code from them. The condants access the recovery
subsystem and obtain recovery codes that they must provide to the
account holder. With a sucient number of recovery codes, the
account holder is allowed to access his account and to set a new
password.
The recovery codes may be compared to key shares in our re-
search setting. However, the social authentication process is medi-
ated by the website that provides the recovery subsystem. In our
setting we assume that the entire process runs largely unmediated
by an electronic system. Secondly, the information condants need
to access the recovery subsystem is provided to them in electronic
form. This exposes the recovery information to online hacking at-
tacks. As a mitigation, we chose to focus on tangible shares instead
of sharing in electronic form.
Risk Assessment. Several authors investigate and model attacks
against social authentication schemes [6–8]. Once again, the setting
of Schechter et al. [9] is the most relevant one for us as a reference.
They ran two social engineering experiments. In one experiment,
they measured the ecacy of attacks against condants based on
forged email. In the second experiment, they measured the e-
ciency of attacks on condants by members of a victim’s social
circle using phone calls. The email attacks had limited ecacy in
the rst experiment. However, 45% of the calls in experiment two
were successful. Similar attacks may occur in our research setting.
We hope that tangibles make misguided sharing of information less
convenient, and therefore less likely. Verifying this is future work
for us, though. We decided to begin by researching how well share
retrieval works.
Secret Sharing in Practice. A few implementations of secret shar-
ing exist in practical processes and applications. For example, secret
sharing is used to protect the DNSSEC root keys. The YubiHSM5
hardware security module supports secret sharing as a key backup
mechanism. Even a blockchain-based secret sharing platform ex-
ists.6 These products address expert users whereas we explore how
casual users may interact with the concept.
9 CONCLUSIONS
Secret sharing can play a useful role in protecting the availability
and condentiality of digital data. Managing shares oine drives
up the costs of attacks and likely eliminates a large class of adver-
saries compared to online management. We found that oine share
management is slow but appears practical using paper or key tags
as tangible carriers of share information. The lack of a signicant
dierence of retrieval success suggests that parameters other than
the form factor may be optimized, for example, the costs and ease
of producing tangibles. This favors paper.
Setting k = 3, n = 5 seems sucient to ensure that most keys
will be recoverable. However, the safety margin is thin and a larger
n is recommendable. A disconcerting number of condants knew
enough other condants to recover the shared key collaboratively.
Therefore increasing n is recommendable. Although, it is a risk
to solicit collaboration because honest condants may warn the
user of the attempted breach of trust. This may be encouraged
by instructing condants to notify the user on a predened chan-
nel (email or phone number) of each and any attempt to initiate
the share retrieval even if the user appears to have done so him-
self. Instructions to this eect may be printed on shares to remind
condants of this security precaution.
An interesting topic for future work is to automate means to help
users decide to whom they should distribute shares, for example,
based on their social networks. Perhaps this allows to reduce the
likelihood that multiple condants collaborate. Other research may
look at how users can best be supported in the process of producing
shares and recovering keys from them.
