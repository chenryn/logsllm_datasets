User:  How to set up the SMTP server and configure the email sending service?
Assistant: To set up the SMTP server and configure the email delivery service, you can follow the steps below: 1. Open the management interface of your SMTP server. 2. Create an email account in the server management interface and assign the required permissions. 3. Add an SMTP library or module (like PHPMailer) to your application. 4. Configure the necessary parameters such as the address, port, security protocol, and authentication information of the SMTP server in the application program. 5. Create a sender email address and name and use it to send the email. 6. Write code in the application to send emails using the SMTP connection. 7. Test to make sure your SMTP server and application are sending mail correctly. 8. If necessary, you can also configure other settings such as email anti-spam and activate SPF records (such as DNS records) to ensure that emails reach recipients' mailboxes smoothly. Note that the specific SMTP server settings and configuration methods may vary depending on the application and SMTP service provider, so you need to read the relevant documents and guides carefully to ensure that your SMTP configuration is correct.
