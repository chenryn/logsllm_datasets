Figure 4: Partial Deployment Our simulation (solid lines) and theoretical (dotted lines) results for CodeRed
(top) and Slammer (bottom) random scanning worms for each defense strategy. Each graph shows the infected
host percentage over time for ﬁve diﬀerent incremental deployment ratios (α). The theoretic predictions and
experimental results match well.
should expect worms to take advantage of this weakness.
We call worms that repeatedly attempt infection until suc-
cess brute-force worms. With a uniform protection factor p,
a brute-force worm will need to make about 1
p infection at-
tempts before succeeding. Figure 6(a) shows the Proactive
Protection defense against a normal Slammer worm out-
break, while Figure 6(b) shows the eﬀectiveness against a
brute-force Slammer worm.
We can make a brute force worm smarter by allowing all
worms to share a global list of discovered vulnerable hosts.
We call such a worm a Collaborative Brute-force Worm.
Figure 6(c) shows the eﬀectiveness of Proactive Protection
against a collaborative brute-force worm.
6.1.1 Hardened Proactive Protection
We create a Hardened Proactive Protection to combat
brute-force and collaborative brute-force worms by augment-
ing each participating host a connection counter which is
incremented on each failed infection attempt from a host.
When the counter exceeds a sensitivity threshold R, the par-
ticipating host no longer accepts new connections from that
host.
We can derive the time evolution I(t) for Hardened Proac-
tive Protection with full deployment against the brute-force
worm as:
dI(t)
dt
=
βRpI(t)(N − I(t))
N
(29)
using hit-lists, the defense result will be the same as shown
in Figure 8 (a) & (e).

Figure 7: Eﬀect of the sensitivity threshold on hard-
ened Proactive Protection
Figure 7 shows the eﬀect of diﬀerent sensitivity threshold
values for the Hardened Proactive Protection against the
brute-force Slammer worm. For all R values the number
of infections over the ﬁrst 500 seconds is about the same.
After that, we see that smaller R values, i.e., the defense
allows fewer failed infection attempts from a host, results
in a slower growth rate. Note that for a brute-force worm
Figure 6(d-e) shows the result of Hardened Proactive Pro-
tection with R = 10 against a brute-force and collaborative
brute-force Slammer worm. Note this worm uses fast scan-
ning, and coordinates via a master global list of yet un-
infected vulnerable hosts. Our results indicate Hardened
Proactive Protection is eﬀective even against such smart
worms.
