Modeling Service Relationships for Service Networks 11
Our idea behind the implementation of service relationships is pragmatic
and it is based on the objective to create a linked global service network using
machine-readabledescriptions[26].Therefore,themodelwasimplementedusing
the Resource Description Framework (RDF) which allows semantic information
to be expressed as a graph. To improve the integration with other semantic
Web initiatives, the model establishes links with various existing ontologies to
reuseconceptsfromverticalandhorizontaldomainssuchasSKOS(taxonomies),
Dublin Core (documents), Linked-USDL (service descriptions) and so on. The
implementation is available at http://rdfs.genssiz.org/ossr.rdf.
The OSSR model was designed to integrate with Linked-USDL. In other
words, a relationship connects two service systems which can be represented
with Linked-USDL. Since the model references services using a URI, other ser-
vice descriptions can be used (e.g. WSDL, OWL-S, and *-USDL [7, 8]). Com-
pared to the various choices available, the use of USDL has many benefits since
itbridgesabusiness,anoperational,andatechnicalperspectivetodescribeser-
vices. Once services and relationships are described in RDF with Linked-USDL
and OSSR, respectively, it becomes possible to make queries over distributed
service networks using the SPARQL RDF query language [27].
Listing 1 illustrates the use of the OSSR model. The relationship created,
identified by http://rdfs.genssiz.org/ossr/2012/10/, relates two services:

(http://www.mysql.com/). The relationship was modeled from the SugarCRM
point-of-view since the OSSR model specifies that it is the source element.

Listing 1. Example of an OSSR relationship relating two service systems
The relationship indicates that the MySQL service system is a provider of
theSugarCRMservice; thetwo serviceshave ahighdegree ofinvolvement;they
establish a relation at the activity level; the service systems are different; and
MySQL is a component of the SugarCRM service offering. Finally, a cause-
effect relation on quality is established between the KPI Availability of the
SugarCRM and the KPI Reliability of MySQL. This causality is positive
since when the Reliability of MySQL increases/decreases the Availability
of the SugarCRM service also increases/decreases. In this exercise, only one
relationship was created, but several relationships can be created between two
service systems, for example, to express more complex cause-effect relations.
5 Related Work
The work on relationships has mainly been carried out in the fields of business
management, supply chain management, and operation management. The main
contributions (e.g. [13, 14, 15, 9]) have generally discussed the objectives, moti-
vation, and benefits of relationships for businesses. While business relationships

look at relationships from a macro perspective, service relationships look at re-
lationships from a micro perspective. According to Jensen and Petersen [28],
in service-based economies there is a fundamental need to move from a macro
strategic business orientation to a fine-grained activity-based service analysis.
Furthermore,previousworkdoesnotproposesconceptualmodelsnorformalisms
to build computer-understandable descriptions of relationships as described in
this paper.
e3service [22] provides an ontology to model e-business models and services.
The model targets to represent very simple relations between services from an
internal perspective, e.g. core-enhancing, core-supporting, and substitute. From
an external perspective, the value chains proposed do not capture explicitly

In[29],theauthorslookatservicenetworksfromaBusinessProcessManage-
ment(BPM)andServiceOrientedArchitecture(SOA)perspectivesandpresent
the Service Network Notation (SNN). SNN provides UML artifacts to model
value chain relationships of economic value. These relationships take the form
of what we can call ’weak’ relationships since they only capture offerings and
rewards which occur between services. The notation is to be used to describe
how a new service can be composed from a network of existing services. The

created using BPM to describe the interactions of existing SOA-based services.
Allee [30] uses a graph-based notation to model value flows inside a network
ofagentssuchastheexchangeofgoods,services,revenue,knowledge,andintan-
giblevalues.Inthesamelines,WeillandVitale[31]havedevelopedaformalism,
called the e-business model schematic, to analyze businesses. The schematic is
a graphical representation aiming at identifying a business model’s important
elements. This includes the firm relationships with its suppliers and allies, ben-
efits each participant receives, and the major flows of product, information, and
money. Both approaches only take into account value flows and do not consider
other types of relationships that can be established between agents.
In all these works, relationships can benefit from a deeper study to increase
their expressiveness rather than simply connecting flows, cross-organizational
processes, or calculating the global added value of distributed activities. Roles,

Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model – from an extensive litera-
ture review process. Service relationships are very different from the temporal
and control-flow relations found in business process models. They need to relate
service systems accounting for various perspectives such as roles, associations,
dependencies, and comparisons. After designing the OSSR conceptual model,
it was evaluated and implemented. The encoding was based on Linked Data
principles to retain simplicity for computation, reuse existing vocabularies to
maximize compatibility, and provide a simple - yet effective - means for pub-
