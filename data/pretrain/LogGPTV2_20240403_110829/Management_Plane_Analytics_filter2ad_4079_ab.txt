### Planned Maintenance and Ticket Analysis

Planned maintenance, conducted by operators, is excluded from our analysis because maintenance tickets are unlikely to be triggered by performance or availability issues. Ticket logs capture a wide range of network issues, making them a valuable measure of network health for operators. Specifically, operators from the OSP (Operator Service Provider) indicated that the number of tickets is a useful metric. Other metrics derived from network tickets, such as the number of high-impact problems and mean time to resolution, are less reliable due to inconsistencies in ticketing practices. For example, impact levels are often subjective, and tickets may not be marked as resolved until well after the problem has been fixed. As future work, we plan to explore how to accurately obtain more fine-grained health measures using tools like NetSieve [26].

### Current Management Practices

There is currently little consensus in the community on the impact of different management practices on network health. We conducted two studies to highlight this lack of consensus: a qualitative survey of network operators and a quantitative characterization of management practices at a large OSP.

#### 3.1 Operators' Perspectives

Our survey covered 51 network operators, recruited through the NANOG mailing list (45 operators), our campus network (4), and the large OSP (2). We asked operators about the importance of ten practices listed in Table 1. The results, summarized in Figure 2, show clear consensus only on the number of change events. For other practices, such as network size, number of models used, and inter-device configuration complexity, opinions were divided. Even within the same organization, there was significant diversity in opinions.

We also asked operators to suggest additional practices they believe have a high impact on network health. Responses included the number of operators, skill levels of operators, documentation and training provided, extent of auditing tools, and pre-change analysis. These metrics are difficult to quantify because they relate to the operators rather than the networks. Integrating such metrics into MPA (Management Practice Analysis) is a topic for future work.

#### 3.2 Management Practices in a Large OSP

The diversity in opinions could be due to the fact that operators manage different networks. However, our characterization of management practices within an OSP revealed significant heterogeneity. The OSP owns over 850 networks, each hosting one or more web services or interconnecting other networks. Our datasets cover a 17-month period from August 2013 to December 2014. Table 2 summarizes the key aspects of the data.

**Design Practices:**
- The control and data planes of the networks vary significantly in their physical and logical structure.
- The median network's hardware and firmware heterogeneity is low (entropy metric < 0.67).
- The number of data and control plane protocols configured across networks is almost uniformly distributed between 1 and 8.
- Configuration complexity metrics (intra- and inter-device references) vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude across networks.

**Operational Practices:**
- There is significant diversity in what and how networks are changed.
- Changes to router stanzas are uncommon for the median network but prevalent in about 5% of networks.
- The number of change events and changes involving middleboxes, which were considered impactful by operators, show significant diversity.
- The modality of changes is also diverse, with 40% of networks having at least half of the changes automated, while in 10% of networks, only 15% of changes are automated.

This level of diversity within the same organization suggests that operators have little agreement on which practices are good. This lack of agreement is confirmed by conversations with OSP operators, who also noted that they do not have a way to map adjustments in management practices to shifts in network health. Helping such operators is the goal of MPA.

### MPA Overview

Given the diversity and complexity of management practices, a systematic framework is needed to understand their impact on network health and improve management practices. MPA aims to achieve two goals:

1. **Identify Top Management Practices:**
   - Help operators derive the top k management practices that impact network health.
   - Challenges include the non-linear relationships between practices and network health, and the interdependencies among practices.
   - We use mutual information to uncover statistical dependencies and nearest neighbor matching of propensity scores in the context of quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) to identify causal relationships.

2. **Predict Impact of Current Practices:**
   - Help operators predict the ongoing impact of current management practices on individual network health.
   - This goes beyond focusing on top practices and incorporates the effects of one-off deviations and practices whose impact manifests only in specific situations.
   - We use boosting and oversampling of unhealthy network data to build accurate predictive models.

### Management Practices That Impact Network Health

Identifying management practices that impact network health is valuable but challenging. The nature of these practices can lead to non-linear or non-monotonic relationships with network health, and practices are often interdependent.

**5.1 Dependence Analysis**

Common approaches like ANOVA and PCA/ICA are not suitable for MPA due to their assumptions about linear relationships and independent components. Instead, we use mutual information (MI) to identify statistical dependencies without making assumptions about the nature of the relationship.

**5.1.1 Mutual Information**

- MI measures how much knowing a practice reduces uncertainty about network health.
- We compute MI and conditional mutual information (CMI) to examine dependencies between practices and network health.
- Binning strategies are used to reduce noise from minor variations and handle long-tailed distributions.

**5.1.2 Results for the OSP**

- Table 3 lists the top 10 management practices with the strongest statistical dependence on network health.
- Visual confirmation of these dependencies is provided in Figures 4 and 6.
- Interestingly, some practices that were highly rated in the survey, such as the fraction of events with a middlebox change, did not appear in the top 10.

In general, more design practices are statistically dependent with each other, reflecting the natural connections between many design decisions. Evaluating the impact of a management practice on network health requires considering these interdependencies.
