When developing, I need to handle certain aspects slightly differently compared to when the application is eventually deployed to Google's servers. Is there a straightforward way to determine whether my code is running in the development environment (SDK) or in the live (production) environment?

**Solution:**

As of October 2020, I attempted to use `os.environ["SERVER_SOFTWARE"]` and `os.environ["APPENGINE_RUNTIME"]` to distinguish between the environments, but these keys did not provide the expected results. Instead, I logged all the keys available in `os.environ` to identify a suitable indicator.

Among the logged keys, I found `GAE_RUNTIME`, which I used to differentiate between the local development environment and the cloud environment. Note that the exact key may change, or you can define your own custom environment variable in `app.yaml`.

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this:

1. **Log the Environment Variables:**
   - Add a logging statement to capture all the keys in `os.environ`. For example, you can create a test webpage that logs these values or simply add a logging statement in your main application file.
   
   ```python
   import os
   import logging

   # Log all environment variables
   for key, value in os.environ.items():
       logging.info(f"{key}: {value}")
   ```

2. **Check the Environment:**
   - Use the logged environment variables to check if your application is running in the local environment or the cloud environment. For instance, you can check for the presence of `GAE_RUNTIME` or any other relevant key.

   ```python
   def is_local_environment():
       return 'GAE_RUNTIME' not in os.environ

   if is_local_environment():
       # Code for the local development environment
       print("Running in the local development environment.")
   else:
       # Code for the production environment
       print("Running in the production environment.")
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively determine the environment in which your application is running and adjust your code accordingly.
