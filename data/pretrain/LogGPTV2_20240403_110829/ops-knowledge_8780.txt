User: How to monitor system performance such as disk IO, memory, and CPU under the Linux system?
Assistant: Under the Linux system, you can use the following tools to monitor system performance: 1. top: You can check the occupancy of CPU, memory and other resources in the system in real time. 2. vmstat: Used to monitor system memory, virtual memory, CPU operating status, IO operating status and other information. 3. iostat: You can view the IO status of the disk, including disk read and write speed, IOPS and other data. 4. sar: It can monitor the CPU, memory, disk IO, network and other performance indicators of the system in real time, and can set timing sampling. 5. ps: You can view the process information currently running on the system. Through the above tools, you can fully understand the performance status of the system, find performance bottlenecks, and perform performance optimization.
