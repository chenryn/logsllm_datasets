bug
**What is the current behavior?**
When I try to load dynamic module with
`import('/path/to/my/module.js').then()` it work, but when i try to import
module with `import(rootPath + '/' + myModuleName + '/index.js').then()` it
doesn't work.
I got:
     Error: Cannot find module '/Users/hubert_i/Emodyz/launcher-ezgames.eu/modules/test/index.js'.
