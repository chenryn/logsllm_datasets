creases while the aggregated consumption is decreased and
the population is no longer in a social optimum.
(a) The utility function of the population decreases when
the Fraudster launches its attack.
(b) The Fraudster can create an attack that maximizes
its utility and allows it to consume more power than with
no attack.
Figure 3: Fraudster attack for DLC model.
By maximizing Eq. (10), the fraudster would be the only
one beneﬁting from the system, and the identity of the at-
tacker might be uncovered by the central authority if it
monitors the term qt
i in the FOC of some victims–Eq. (12).
Therefore, the attacker might want to mask its actions by
increasing the utility of a subset S of the population (includ-
ing the attacker); in this way, the attacker can gain plausible
deniability (i.e., lack of evidence proving an allegation) as it
is only one among a set of beneﬁciaries. In addition to make
the attack more subtle (and thus harder to detect), the at-
tacker can use a parameter λ to quantify how much of the
utility function it wants to maximize compared to the utility
that others will receive:

For illustration purposes, let us assume an homogeneous
population in which agents have the same consumption pref-
erences. Since the population is homogeneous, we know that
the consumption of all the members of a set (either S or V)
is the same. That is, users that are in the same conditions
must have the same consumption at the solution of Eq. (13),
denoted by x. In this case, we denote by xs and xv the con-
sumption of users from either S or V, respectively. We can
take into account this property, as well as the form of the
price function p(z) = βz + b, to obtain the following expres-
sions from Eq (14) and (15):

be seen as an approximation of the utility of an isolated
population in Eq. (19).
Summarizing, Eq. (18) gives information about the utility
ratio between an attacker and a victim in function of λ and
the number of agents in each subpopulaiton. If we consider
Ns = γN and Nv = N − Ns, then Eq. (18) can be rewritten

Eq. (20) shows the attacker’s utility as a function of the
proportion of agents that beneﬁt from the attack (γ). This

relation holds as long as the consumption of the victims is
diﬀerent from zero.
Fig. 4 shows the utility of the attacker for diﬀerent val-
ues of λ (severity of attack) and γ (percentage of beneﬁted
consumers). Now, observe how the maximum beneﬁt of the
attacker decreases signiﬁcantly with the proportion of agents
beneﬁting from the attack (γ): in other words, the price that
the attacker pays in order to maintain plausible deniabiliy
if the attack is detected increases signiﬁcantly. Fig. 4 also
shows that the utility of the attacker does not increase in-
deﬁnitely with λ but reaches a saturation point where the
electricity consumption by the aﬀected population is so low,
that the attacker cannot gain any more by sending them
control signals requesting lower consumption. It is interest-
ing to note also that for small values of λ, the attacker does
not gain much by being the single user beneﬁting from the
attacks; in fact, for twice the importance of the selﬁsh utility
(λ = 2) and a population of 5% consumers beneﬁting form
the attack (γ = 0.05), the attacker is better oﬀ than when it
is the only recipient of the beneﬁts (γ = 0.01 in a population
of 100).
4.2 Dynamic Pricing
Recall that in the dynamic pricing model the central au-
thority sends incentives I to drive the agents towards a
Pareto optimal point.

with respect to qi (where Ii is the incentive signal sent by
the utility to drive the system to a Pareto equilibrium). We
formulate the goal of the fraudster in the DR with incentives
case as the following optimization problem:
maximize
I,qi
Ui(q) + Ii(q),
(21)
Because in contrast to the DLC model, in the dynamic
pricing model the central authority does not know the valu-
ation functions vi, the objective function in Eq. (21) cannot
be optimized by an attacker, even if it compromises the cen-
tral system. Therefore, we ﬁrst use an approximation to this
objective function that can be solved and then we compare
how close it achieves the real objective in Eq. (21).

For λ large enough, this attack will (for practical pur-
poses) maximize Ui(q). Note that this attack does not re-
quire the valuation function of each user, but it needs to
know the total consumption of either the users that beneﬁt
the attack or those who do not.
We now deﬁne the goal of the attacker in the dynamic
pricing model to ﬁnd an incentive signal I to drive the sys-
tem towards the solution of Eq. (13). λ and γ are again
parameters that the attacker can select.
Let qs be the solution to Eq. (13). Recall that in this
case the attacker cannot control q but instead controls I.
Leveraging the theory of mechanism design we can show
that an attacker can incentivize all agents to adopt qs by
sending the following false incentives:

the scheme can be implemented if there is a source of ex-
ternal subsidies to fund part of the incentives. Note that
an homogeneous population at the Pareto optimal outcome
does not require external subsidies; however, if an attacker
disrupts the equilibrium, the agents with low and large con-
sumption receive positive and negative rewards, respectively.
As the attack increases (λ), the demand imbalance is higher
and consequently, the social planer has to increase the mag-
nitude of the incentives. However, the taxes imposed to the
attacker (due to its large consumption) are not enough to
sustain the rewards to the victims and the amount of exter-
nal subsidies tend to increase.
Figure 5: Impact of the attack in the fraudster’s
utility as a function of λ.
Now,
let us study how well our approximate problem
solves the ideal (but infeasible) objective function of the at-
tacker. First, we note that Eq. (21) has multiple solutions,
and only one local maximum corresponds to the Pareto opti-
mal outcome. On the other hand, the optimization problem
in Eq. (13) is feasible and has a unique solution, but might
lead to a suboptimal attack.
Fig. 5 shows the utility of an attacker as a function of λ.
With λ = 1 the attacker does not have any impact on the
system, and the system is in the Pareto optimal outcome.
As λ increases slightly, the utility of the attacker decreases
as a consequence of incentives, that can be seen as taxes;
however, the attack is proﬁtable for larger values of λ, con-
verging to the value of the infeasible problem in Eq. (10).
The attack has negative impact on the population, which
is forced to reduce its consumption and consequently its util-
ity (see Fig. 6).
A drawback of the dynamic pricing scheme is that it does
not satisfy the budget balance property [22]. In other words,
Figure 7: Fraudsters obtain more beneﬁts from at-
tacking DLC systems when compared to dynamic
pricing.
We now compare in more detail the impact of fraudster
attacks to DLC and dynamic pricing schemes. Fig. 7 and
8 show the impact of the proportion of agents that beneﬁt
from the attack γ (the ones that mask the identity of the
attacker) in the utility of the attacker and the population,
respectively. Note that the attacker earns less beneﬁts as
the size of the beneﬁted population grows; however, it is

important to note that an attacker obtains less utility in
a system with dynamic prices when compared to a DLC
model.
In contrast, the attack causes lower losses to all consumers
with dynamic pricing because the victims receive rewards for
their low consumption, as seen in Fig. 8. Furthermore, as
γ tends to 1, the population welfare increases because more
agents obtain beneﬁts of the attack. Thus, with γ = 1 the
population has no victims and the outcome is optimal in the
sense of Pareto.
Similar behavior can be seen when we evaluate the severity
of the attack λ in terms of the utility gained by the attacker
in Fig. 9 and the average utility of the population in Fig. 10.
Fig. 9 shows that the attack is not optimal for a system
with dynamic prices, and consequently, the attacker might
do worse that the Pareto optimal outcome for λ < 2.3. This
happens because the attacker is penalized due to its large
consumption; however, this penalization is reduced as the
other consumers are at their minimum consumption when λ
is large enough.
