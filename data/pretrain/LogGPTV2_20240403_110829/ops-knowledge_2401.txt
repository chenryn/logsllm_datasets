User: Please list and explain common types of network attacks, such as DoS, DDoS, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.
Assistant: 1. DoS (Denial of Service, denial of service attack): The attacker sends a large amount of forged traffic and malicious data requests to the target server to overload the target server and cannot continue to provide normal services. Common DoS attack methods include: TCP SYN attack, UDP attack, Ping attack, HTTP Flood, etc. 2. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service, distributed denial of service attack): similar to DoS attack, but the attacker uses multiple infected botnet devices to attack the target system to achieve higher attack effect. Because attackers often use infected botnet devices around the world, DDoS attacks are difficult to track and locate. 3. SQL injection: The attacker submits malicious SQL codes to the target website, causing the website database to execute malicious codes, thereby obtaining relevant sensitive data. SQL injection is common when website application development is not standardized or necessary security measures are not taken, and there are loopholes when users enter data. 4. Cross-site scripting (XSS, Cross-site scripting): The attacker injects malicious script codes into the pages of the target website, making users execute these malicious scripts when browsing the website, so as to achieve the purpose of obtaining sensitive information of users. 5. CSRF (Cross-site request forgery, cross-site request forgery): The attacker pretends to be a user and submits malicious requests to the target website, such as deleting user accounts, initiating money transfers, etc., so as to achieve the purpose of attacking the target. It is common that the target website does not have strict authentication control on user identities, and attackers can invade the target website by sending forged requests. 6. Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities in the target system to implement intrusion operations, such as remote code execution, privilege escalation, and file reading and writing. 7. Social engineering: By pretending to be a trusted person or organization, the attacker tricks the user into disclosing personal sensitive information by means of deception and guidance, or implements the attack operation through phishing and malicious attachments. 8. Backdoor attack: By leaving a backdoor program in the target system, the attacker can remotely access the target system at any time, steal personal privacy and sensitive information, or execute malicious codes in the target system.
