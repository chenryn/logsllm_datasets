**Description:**
The `debug` command toggles the FTP debugging mode. By default, this mode is turned off. When enabled, the debugging mode displays each command sent to the remote computer, prefixed with the `>` character.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
debug
```

**Examples:**
To toggle the debug mode on and off, enter the following command:

This will switch the current state of the debug mode (i.e., if it is off, it will turn on, and if it is on, it will turn off).
