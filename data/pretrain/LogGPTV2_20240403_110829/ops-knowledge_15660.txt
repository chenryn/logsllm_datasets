User: How do I get the ports that a process is listening on using python? The pid of the process is known.
Assistant: If you don't want to parse the output of a program like netstat or lsof, you can grovel through the /proc filesystem and try to find documentation on the files within.  /proc/<pid>/net/tcp might be especially interesting to you.  Of course, the format of those files might change between kernel releases, so parsing command output is generally considered more reliable.
