Question: "A web application's login servlet is designed to authenticate users and handle login exceptions as follows:

java
public class BankManagerLoginServlet extends HttpServlet {
  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    String username = request.getParameter('username');
    String password = request.getParameter('password');
    try {
      boolean isAuthentic = authenticateUser(username, password);
      if (!isAuthentic) {
        throw new FailedLoginException('Failed Login for user ' + username + ' with password ' + password);
      }
      // Proceed to success page
    } catch (FailedLoginException ex) {
      // Forward to error page with exception message
    }
  }
}


What are the potential security implications of including the user-supplied password in the `FailedLoginException` message?"
 "A": "It could lead to information leakage by revealing user passwords to unauthorized individuals."
 "B": "It might be beneficial as it allows users to see and correct their mistyped passwords."
 "C": "It could result in improved security by discouraging users from using simple passwords."
 "D": "It may increase security by providing system administrators with the information needed to track failed login attempts."
Answer: A
