## Abstract
BBN, Harvard, and Boston University are collaborating to build the DARPA Quantum Network, the world's first network that delivers end-to-end security via high-speed Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The network is designed to protect against sophisticated eavesdropping attacks. The first network link has been operational in our laboratory since December 2002, providing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between private enclaves. User traffic is protected using a weak-coherent implementation of quantum cryptography, suitable for deployment in metropolitan areas via standard telecom (dark) fiber. This paper introduces quantum cryptography, discusses its relevance to modern secure networks, and describes its unique physical layer, specialized QKD protocol suite, and our extensions to IPsec to integrate it with quantum cryptography.

## 1. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
Modern networks typically rely on symmetric (secret) key or asymmetric (public) key cryptographic techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of network traffic. Public key systems are often used for authentication and establishing secret "session" keys, while symmetric key systems protect the actual data. Some systems transport secret keys out-of-band, such as via couriers, as in classical cryptography.

Quantum physics, particularly unitarity, the uncertainty principle, and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) violation of Bell's inequalities, suggests a third paradigm for key distribution: quantum cryptography. Initial experiments have shown the potential of this approach. Assuming the theoretical models hold true in practical devices, the fundamental laws of nature can be leveraged to ensure the confidentiality of transmitted data.

As illustrated in Figure 1, QKD uses two distinct channels: one for transmitting quantum key material via very dim (single photon) light pulses, and another public channel for all other message traffic, including cryptographic protocols and encrypted user traffic.

QKD involves the transmission of raw key material from Alice to Bob via the quantum channel, followed by processing to derive the actual keys. This processing includes public communication (key agreement protocols) and specialized QKD algorithms. The resulting keys can then be used for cryptographic purposes. Any eavesdropper (Eve) attempting to intercept the quantum channel will cause a measurable disturbance, which Alice and Bob can detect and counteract.

Quantum cryptography was first proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, who also defined the BB84 protocol. Several research teams worldwide have successfully built and operated quantum cryptographic devices. These systems can support distances up to about 70 km through fiber, though at low bit rates (e.g., a few bits/second). Free-space QKD has been demonstrated over distances up to 23 km. Additionally, there is interest in QKD based on entanglement between pairs of photons produced by Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).

## 2. Desirable QKD Attributes
QKD offers a method for two devices to agree on a shared random sequence of bits, with a very low probability that eavesdroppers can infer these bits' values. These sequences are used as secret keys for encoding and decoding messages. The strengths of QKD can be evaluated against several key distribution goals:

### Confidentiality of Keys
Confidentiality is the primary motivation for QKD. Public key systems face ongoing uncertainty about their mathematical intractability, and widely used key agreement primitives like Diffie-Hellman may be vulnerable in the future. Classical secret key systems have different issues, such as insider threats and logistical challenges in distributing keying material. Properly integrated QKD can provide automatic key distribution with superior security.

### Authentication
QKD does not inherently provide authentication. Current strategies include prepositioning secret keys for hash-based authentication or hybrid QKD-public key techniques. Prepositioned keys require initial distribution, which can be costly and logistically challenging, and may be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. Hybrid approaches inherit the vulnerabilities of public key systems to advances in quantum computing or mathematics.

### Sufficiently Rapid Key Delivery
Key distribution systems must deliver keys fast enough to prevent encryption devices from exhausting their supply. Current QKD systems achieve around 1,000 bits/second, which is too slow for some applications but may be sufficient for less secure but adequate algorithms like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Improving QKD throughput is both desirable and feasible.

### Robustness
Robustness is crucial for QKD. Traditional QKD setups are fragile, as they rely on a single point-to-point link. Disruption of this link, whether by active eavesdropping or fiber cut, halts key distribution. A meshed QKD network, offering multiple paths for key distribution, is inherently more robust.

### Distance- and Location-Independence
In an ideal scenario, any entity can agree on keying material with any other authorized entity. The Internet's security architecture achieves this, allowing any computer to form a security association with any other through IPsec. QKD, however, requires a direct, unencumbered path for photons and can only operate over short distances (a few tens of kilometers through fiber).

### Resistance to Traffic Analysis
Adversaries may perform traffic analysis on key distribution systems, inferring confidential information flow. Most QKD setups assume dedicated, point-to-point links, making key distribution relationships clear. Strategies to impede such analysis are needed.

## 3. The DARPA Quantum Network
The DARPA Quantum Network aims to enhance QKD performance in weaker areas. This involves introducing new QKD technologies, such as high-speed sources of entangled photons, and improving system architecture, such as a network of trusted relays to address distance and location independence.
