User: I am new to Hyper-v,WMI and using WMIC i need to create a VM(virtual machine). Can anybody help me through a sample code or script to refer? Preferred script language is Python and I am using CentOS 6 to run wmic. And is there any way to create VM via wmic commands? I have gone through many scripts and code snippets but they were all in powershell and I dont want to use powershell.
Assistant: There are so many scripts in C# to do the same work
if you dont want to use powershell scripts you can choose the best method to run a powershell command for each thing and run the powershell command from python script 
i did the same in C# with Process Class
