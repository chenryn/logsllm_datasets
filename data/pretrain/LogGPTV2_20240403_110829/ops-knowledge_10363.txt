User: In a microservice architecture system, what are the common load balancing strategies? Please explain their advantages and disadvantages and applicable scenarios respectively.
Assistant: Common load balancing strategies include: 1. Round Robin The round robin algorithm is to assign requests to each server in turn, and cycle in turn until all servers are assigned once, and then start from the beginning. The advantage is that it is simple to implement and well balanced, and it is suitable for scenarios where the server performance is similar and the requests are relatively uniform. The disadvantage is that it cannot perceive the actual load of the server, and it is easy to cause some servers to be overloaded and cause performance degradation. 2. Least Connections The least connection algorithm is to assign requests to the server with the least number of current connections, so that all servers can handle an approximate number of requests and achieve the effect of load balancing. The advantage is that it can be dynamically adjusted according to the actual load of the server, which is more balanced than other algorithms and suitable for scenarios with long connections. The disadvantage is that the implementation is more complicated, and the decision-making is easily affected by problems such as network delays, and it needs to occupy certain system resources. 3. IP hash (IP Hash) The IP hash algorithm performs Hash calculation based on the client IP address, assigns the request to a specific server, and keeps the same client request always sent to the same server. The advantage is that it is simple to implement, easy to expand and maintain, and suitable for stateful scenarios. The disadvantage is that in the case of uneven distribution of IP addresses and excessive request volume, it is easy to cause excessive load on some servers. 4. Weighted round robin (Weighted Round Robin) The weighted round robin algorithm assigns different weights to different servers according to different server performance. According to the weight value of each server, requests are allocated to each server in turn, and the server with higher weight value handles more requests. The advantage is that weight distribution can be performed according to server performance differences, which is suitable for situations where the performance or request volume of each server varies greatly. The disadvantage is that the weight needs to be set in advance. For scenarios with large load fluctuations, the weight needs to be adjusted continuously. 5. Least Response Time The least response time algorithm uses the response time of each server as the basis for decision-making, and selects the server with the shortest response time to process the request. The advantage is that it can be dynamically adjusted according to the actual response load of the server, which is suitable for scenarios where the amount of requests fluctuates greatly and the response time is sensitive. The disadvantage is that the implementation is relatively complicated, and multiple response time measurements and calculations are required, and the decision-making is easily affected by problems such as network delays.
