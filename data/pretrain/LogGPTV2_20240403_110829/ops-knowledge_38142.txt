User: We're looking into transport/protocol solutions and were about to do various performance tests, so I thought I'd check with the community if they've already done this:
Has anyone done server performance tests for simple echo services as well as serialization/deserialization for various messages sizes comparing EJB3, Thrift, and Protocol Buffers on Linux?
Primarily languages will be Java, C/C++, Python, and PHP.
Update: I'm still very interested in this, if anyone has done any further benchmarks please let me know. Also, very interesting benchmark showing compressed JSON performing similar / better than Thrift / Protocol Buffers, so I'm throwing JSON into this question as well.
Assistant: One of the things near the top of my "to-do" list for PBs is to port Google's internal Protocol Buffer performance benchmark - it's mostly a case of taking confidential message formats and turning them into entirely bland ones, and then doing the same for the data.
When that's been done, I'd imagine you could build the same messages in Thrift and then compare the performance.
In other words, I don't have the data for you yet - but hopefully in the next couple of weeks...
