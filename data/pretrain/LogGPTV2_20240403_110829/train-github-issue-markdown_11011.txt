I noticed a minor issue with the `[src]` link on the following page:

http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/prelude/index.html

The current link points to:
http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/src/std/home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/nightly-linux/build/src/libstd/lib.rs.html#99

However, it should point to:
http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/src/std/home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/nightly-linux/build/src/libstd/prelude.rs.html

I hope this report is helpful in resolving the issue. Thank you!
