### Goal
I am setting up a small server using the App Engine Python development server on Windows. My goal is to read data from a DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) application and serve this data over the Internet in JSON format.

### Current Situation
- The development server is running correctly on port 80.
- I can store and serve data as JSON over the Internet.

### Problem
- I am unable to get the development server to work correctly with the `win32` Python library.
- Even after enabling the `win32` module in the local whitelist, attempting to start a DDE connection results in the following error:

  ```
  This must be an MFC application - try loading win32ui first
      args = ('This must be an MFC application - try loading win32ui first',)
      message = 'This must be an MFC application - try loading win32ui first'
  ```

### Solution
- The issue was not with the Google App Engine (GAE) development server but with the `win32` Python library version.
- I uninstalled the `win32` Python build 216 and installed a previous version (build 214).
- The problem was related to the manifest file in build 216.
- After switching to build 214, the DDE connection works correctly, and the development server operates as expected.

If you encounter similar issues, consider downgrading to a known stable version of the `win32` library.
