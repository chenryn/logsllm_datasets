## Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of a fault management server and its failure-related parameters on high-availability communication systems. The key finding is that, to achieve high overall system availability, the availability of the fault management server itself is less critical than its fail-safe ratio and fault coverage. In other words, when designing fault management servers, more emphasis should be placed on improving the server’s ability to detect faults in functional units and to isolate itself from these units during failures. Trade-offs can be made between the availability of the fault management server, the fail-safe ratio, and the fault coverage ratio to optimize system availability. This paper proposes a cost-effective design for the fault management server.

## 1. Introduction
Fault management is essential in today’s high-availability communication systems. It involves techniques for rapidly detecting, isolating, and recovering from faults, either automatically through software or manually by operators [1]. As shown in Figure 1, fault management typically employs a client-server architecture, with the server entity residing on specific equipment and the clients on the managed functional units. The fault management server detects, isolates, and recovers failures, such as redirecting traffic to redundant equipment when the primary one fails (Figure 1).

It is often intuitive to assume that the fault management server must have high availability to ensure high system availability. For example, it might be suggested that the fault management server should provide at least 5-nine (0.99999) availability to achieve 5-nine system availability. Based on this intuition, it was recommended in [2] that fault management software should run on fault-tolerant computers with duplicated main components (e.g., CPU, memory, I/O controller, bus, power supply, and disk). However, our study shows that this is not necessary. Besides the availability of the fault management server, two additional parameters must be considered: the fault coverage ratio (the probability that system failures can be detected and recovered) and the fail-safe ratio (the probability that a failure of the fault management server will not cause a system outage). To address this potential misconception, we need to reframe the question: what minimum level of availability is required for support systems (e.g., maintenance servers, network management servers) to guarantee 99.999% availability for the operational part of the system?

Markov models for a cluster of computers were constructed in [3][4], and system availability was studied as a function of fault coverage ratio and individual computer availability. It was shown that higher system availability could be achieved over a cluster of non-fault-tolerant computers if a higher coverage ratio was guaranteed. However, the availability of the watchdog (i.e., the server) and its fail-safe characteristics were not considered in these studies.

Fail-safe behavior is the ability of a system to fail without producing a catastrophic result [5]. This concept has been well-defined and widely used in LSI design [5]-[7] and railway applications [8]. Research in these areas focused on the conditions for achieving safety properties and their formal expression. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter, the fail-safe ratio, to quantitatively investigate the impact of fail-safe design on system availability.

After constructing and solving a Markov chain for a communication system with N functional units (each configured as “1+1”) and one fault management server, we study the relationship between server availability, fault coverage ratio, and fail-safe ratio to the system availability. We demonstrate that the fault management server does not need to have 5-nine availability to achieve 5-nine operational system availability, as long as the fail-safe ratio and coverage ratio are sufficiently high. Availability, coverage ratio, and fail-safe ratio are three important parameters of the management server that can be traded off to achieve higher operational system availability. Because fault-tolerant computers are very expensive, our observations lead to a more cost-effective design of the fault management server.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the fault management model and the concepts of fail-safe, fail-safe ratio, and coverage ratio. In Section 3, we construct a Markov chain model and develop a closed-form expression for system availability. Some properties related to the fail-safe ratio and coverage ratio are derived in Section 4. A cost-effective design for the fault management server is proposed in Section 5. Numerical results and discussions are provided in Section 6. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

## 2. Fault Management Model and Some Concepts

### 2.1. Fail-Safe Ratio
Fail-safe behavior is the ability of a system to fail without producing a catastrophic result [5]. This concept has been well-defined and widely used in LSI design [5]-[7] and railway control [8]. In this paper, we revise the definition of fail-safe behavior and extend it to communication systems.

**Definition:** A fault management server is called fail-safe if the failure of the fault management server will not cause a system outage.

To quantitatively evaluate the impact of the fail-safe property, we introduce a new parameter called the fail-safe ratio, \( p_f \), which is defined as the probability that a failure of the fault management server will not cause a system outage.

### 2.2. Fault Coverage Ratio
Due to the complexities and uncertainties inherent in a network and its faults, and due to design faults in fault management software, achieving completely automated fault management is challenging. We denote the fault coverage ratio by \( p_c \), which is the probability that the fault management server can detect a failure in the functional units and redirect traffic to the backup equipment automatically. In this paper, the coverage ratio is assumed to be the same for all functional units. If the fault management server fails to detect and recover the failure in the functional units, it takes time \( T_s(i) \) for the operator to observe the failure and manually switch the traffic of functional unit \( i \).

## 3. Markov Chain Model
We make the following assumptions:

1. The time to failure, repair, and manual recovery are exponentially distributed.
2. If the failure can be detected and recovered by the fault management server, the recovery time is negligible.
3. All functional units are configured as “1+1”.
4. Functional unit \( i \) is considered to be working if there is one equipment element in the primary state.
5. The (operational) system is considered to be working if all the functional units are working.

A list of notations is provided in Table 1.

| Notation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| \( l_f(i) \) | Failure rate of one managed equipment in functional unit \( i \) |
| \( m_f(i) \) | Repair rate of one managed equipment in functional unit \( i \) |
| \( A_e(i) \) | Availability of one managed equipment in functional unit \( i \) |
| \( A_m \) | Availability of the fault management server |
| \( A_s \) | System availability |
| \( p_c \) | Fault coverage ratio |
| \( p_f \) | Fail-safe ratio |
| \( N \) | Number of functional units in the system |
| \( T_s(i) \) | Manual recovery time for functional unit \( i \) |
| \( C_1(p_c) \) | Cost function for achieving fault coverage ratio of \( p_c \) |
| \( C_2(p_f) \) | Cost function for achieving fail-safe ratio of \( p_f \) |
| \( C_3(A_m) \) | Cost function for achieving availability of the fault management server of \( A_m \) |
| \( C_m \) | Total cost of the fault management server |

For functional unit \( i \) (with “1+1” equipment), we consider the following two major cases:

- **The fault management server is not working:**
  - Functional unit \( i \) is working if and only if the primary equipment is working (regardless of the standby unit's status) and the failure of the fault management server does not bring down the primary equipment, with probability \( (1 - A_m)p_f A_e(i) \), where:
    \[
    A_e(i) = \frac{m_f(i)}{l_f(i) + m_f(i)}
    \]
    \[
    A_m = \frac{m_m}{l_m + m_m}
    \]

- **The fault management server is working:**
  - To evaluate the probability of the functional unit being working in this case, we construct a Markov chain as shown in Figure 2.

  ![Figure 2. Markov Chain for Functional Unit \( i \)](figure2.png)

  By solving the Markov chain, we obtain the functional unit availability under the condition that the fault management server is working:
  \[
  q(i) = \frac{(1 - p_c)l_f(i) + \frac{1}{T_s(i)}}{2l_f(i) + \frac{1}{T_s(i)}}
  \]
  \[
  A_f(i) = (1 - A_m)p_f A_e(i) + A_m q(i)
  \]
  \[
  A_s = \prod_{i=1}^N A_f(i)
  \]

## 4. Some Properties

### Property 1
\( A_s \) is an increasing function of \( p_f \), and \( \frac{\partial A_s}{\partial p_f} \) is a decreasing function of \( A_m \).

**Proof:**
\[
\frac{\partial A_s}{\partial p_f} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{\partial A_f(i)}{\partial p_f} \right) \prod_{j \neq i} A_f(j)
\]
\[
\frac{\partial A_f(i)}{\partial p_f} = (1 - A_m)A_e(i) > 0
\]

### Property 2
\( A_s \) is an increasing function of \( p_c \), and \( \frac{\partial A_s}{\partial p_c} \) is an increasing function of \( A_m \).

**Proof:**
\[
\frac{\partial A_s}{\partial p_c} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{\partial A_f(i)}{\partial p_c} \right) \prod_{j \neq i} A_f(j)
\]
\[
\frac{\partial A_f(i)}{\partial p_c} = A_m \frac{\partial q(i)}{\partial p_c} > 0
\]

## 5. Cost-Effective Design for the Fault Management Server
To achieve a cost-effective design for the fault management server, we need to balance the trade-offs between the availability of the server, the fail-safe ratio, and the fault coverage ratio. The total cost \( C_m \) of the fault management server can be expressed as:
\[
C_m = C_1(p_c) + C_2(p_f) + C_3(A_m)
\]
where \( C_1(p_c) \), \( C_2(p_f) \), and \( C_3(A_m) \) are the cost functions for achieving the desired fault coverage ratio, fail-safe ratio, and availability, respectively.

By optimizing these parameters, we can achieve a more cost-effective design for the fault management server while maintaining high system availability.
