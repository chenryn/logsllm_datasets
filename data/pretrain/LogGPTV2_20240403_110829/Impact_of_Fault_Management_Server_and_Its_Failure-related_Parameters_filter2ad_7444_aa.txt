Abstract –
  In this paper, we investigate the  impact of a  fault management server and its failure-related parameters  on 
high-availability communication systems.  The key point is that, to achieve high overall availability of a communication 
system, the availability of the fault management server itself is not as important as its fail-safe ratio and fault coverage. In 
other  words,  in  building  fault  management  servers,  more  attention  should  be  paid  to  improving  the  server’s  ability  of 
detecting  faults  in  functional  units  and  its  own  isolation  under  failure  from  the  functional  units.  Tradeoffs can be made 
between the availability of the fault management server, the fail-safe ratio and the fault coverage ratio to optimize system 
availability. A cost-effective design for the fault management server is proposed in this paper. 
1.Introduction 
Fault management plays an indispensable role in today’s 
high-availability 
Fault 
management  involves  techniques  for  rapidly  detecting, 
isolating and recovering system from the effects of faults, 
either  automatically  by  using  the  fault  management 
communication 
systems. 
software  or  manually  by  operators  [1].  As  shown  in 
Figure  1,  fault  management  usually  uses  a  client-server 
architecture  with  the  server  entity  residing  on  specific 
equipment  and  the  clients  on  the  managed  functional 
units.  The  fault  management  server  detects,  isolates  and 
recovers  failures  occurring  in  the  system,  e.g.,  redirects 
traffic to redundant equipment when the primary one fails 
(Figure 1).

At times, it has been tempting to adopt an “intuitive” view 
requiring  that  the  server  providing  network-level  fault 
management  should  be  highly  available  in  order  to 
achieve higher system availability, for example, the fault 
management  server  should  provide  at 
least  5-nine 
(0.99999)  availability  in  order  to  achieve  5-nine system 
availability.  Based  on  this  intuition,  it  was  strongly 
recommended  in  [2]  that  the fault management software 
should run on fault-tolerant computers which can perform 
logic  self-checking and have all of the main components 
(e.g.,  CPU,  memory,  I/O  controller,  bus,  power  supply 
and disk, etc.) physically duplicated. However, according

in  order 
to  determine 
in  charge  of  delivering 
to our study, this is not necessary. Besides the availability 
of  the  fault  management  server,  one  must  consider  two 
additional  parameters 
the 
availability of the system, namely the fault coverage ratio 
(the  probability  that  the  failures  in  the  system  can  be 
detected  and  recovered)  and  the  fail-safe  ratio  (the 
probability  that  a  failure  of  the  fault  management  server 
will not cause a system outage). In order to dissipate this 
potential  misconception,  one  needs  to  reformulate  the 
system  availability  question  as  follows:    what  minimum 
level of availability needs to be achieved by the support 
systems (e.g., maintenance servers, network management 
servers,  etc)  in  order  to  guarantee  a  99.999%  availability 
for  the  operational  part  of  the  system  (that  part  of  the 
system 
the  main  system 
functionality)? 
The  Markov  models  for  a  cluster  of  computers  were 
constructed  and  system  availability  was  studied  as  a 
function of fault coverage ratio and individual computer 
availability  in  [3][4].  It  was  shown  that  higher  system 
availability could be achieved over a cluster of computers 
with a non-fault-tolerant architecture if a higher coverage 
ratio could be guaranteed. However, the availability of the 
watchdog (i.e., the server) and its fail-safe characteristics 
were not considered in these two papers. 
Fail-safe behavior is the ability of a system to fail without 
producing  a  catastrophic  result  [5].  The  concept  of  fail-
safe  systems  has  been  well  defined  and  widely  used  in 
LSI  design  [5]-[7] and railway applications [8], etc. The 
research  in  these  areas  focused  on  the  conditions  for 
achieving safety properties in a system, and on its formal 
expression. In this paper, we introduce a new parameter, 
i.e., fail-safe ratio, to quantitatively investigate the impact 
of fail-safe design on system availability.   
After  constructing  and  solving  a  Markov  chain  for  a 
communication  system  with  N  functional  units  (each 
functional  unit  is  configured  as  “1+1”)  and  one  fault 
management  server,  we  study  the  relationship  between 
server  availability,  fault  coverage  ratio  and  fail-safe ratio 
to the system availability. We demonstrate that the fault 
management server availability does not have to be 5-nine 
in order to achieve 5-nine operational system availability 
as  long  as  the  fail-safe  ratio  and  coverage  ratio  are 
sufficiently high. Availability, coverage ratio and fail-safe 
ratio  are  three  important  parameters  of  the  management 
server,  which  can  be  traded  off  to  achieve  higher 
operational  system  availability.  Because  fault-tolerant 
computers are very expensive, our observations lead to a 
more  cost-effective  design  of  the  fault  management 
server.    
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2,  we 
briefly introduce the fault management model used in the 
paper  and  the  concepts  of  fail-safe,  fail-safe  ratio,  and 
coverage ratio. In section 3, we construct a Markov chain 
model  and  develop  a  closed-form  expression  of  the 
system  availability.  Some  properties  related  to  the  fail-
safe  ratio  and  coverage  ratio  are  derived  in  Section  4.  A 
cost-effective  design  for  the  fault  management  server  is 
proposed 
in  Section  5.  The  numerical  results  and 
discussions are given in Section 6.  The conclusions are 
drawn in Section 7.  
2. Fault Management Model and Some 
Concepts 
As  shown  in  Figure  1,  there  are  N  functional  units  and 
one  fault  management  server 
the  system.  Each 
functional  unit  is  configured  as  “1+1”,  with  one  unit  as 
primary  and  the  other  as  hot  standby.  Each  equipment 
element  has  a  local  (equipment-level)  fault  management. 
The  fault  management  server  redirects  traffic  to  the 
redundant equipment in case the primary equipment fails 
(the  fault  could  not  be  recovered  by  the  equipment-level 
fault management).

2.1  Fail-safe Ratio 
Fail-safe behavior is the ability of a system to fail but not 
produce a catastrophic result [5]. The concept of fail-safe 
behavior  has  been  well  defined  and  widely  used  in  LSI 
design  [5]-[7] and railway control [8].  In this paper, we 
revise the definition of fail-safe behavior and extend it to 
communication systems.   
[Definition] A fault management server is called fail-safe 
if  the  failure  of  the  fault  management  server  will  not 
cause a system outage. 
In  order  to  quantitatively  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  fail-
safe property, we  introduce a new  parameter  called  fail-
safe ratio,  pf  ,  which is defined as the probability that a 
failure  of  the  fault  management  server  will  not  cause  a 
system outage.

2.2   Fault Coverage Ratio 
Because of the complexities and uncertainties inherent to 
a network and its faults, and because of the design faults 
in 
fault  management  software,  a  completely 
automated fault management is a very difficult objective 
to reach. We denote by pc the fault coverage ratio, i.e., the 
probability  that  the  fault  management  server  can  detect 
the failure in the functional units and redirect traffic to the 
backup  equipment  automatically.  In  this  paper,  the 
coverage  ratio  is  assumed  to  be  the  same  for  all  the 
functional units.  If the fault management server fails to

takes time Ts(i) for the operator to observe the failure and

For functional unit i (with “1+1” equipment), we consider 
the following two major cases: 
•  The fault management server is not working  
•  The fault management server is working  
In the first case, functional unit i is working if and only if 
the primary equipment is working (no matter whether the 
standby unit is working or not) and the failure of the fault 
management  server  does  not  bring  down  the  primary 
equipment, with probability (1- Am)pf Ae(i), where
