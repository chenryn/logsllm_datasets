I recently installed Trac using BitNami, and after restarting my computer, I am unable to get it running as a service. The error log displays the following message:

```
[Fri Dec 02 08:52:40.565865 2016] [:error] [pid 4052:tid 968] C:\Bitnami\trac-1.0.13-0\python\lib\site-packages\setuptools-7.0-py2.7.egg\pkg_resources.py:1045: UserWarning: C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Python-Eggs is writable by group/others and vulnerable to attack when used with get_resource_filename. Consider a more secure location (set with .set_extraction_path or the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable).
```

The common recommendation is to move the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` folder to `C:\egg` or suppress the warning at the command line. I have already set the `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` environment variable for the system, in Trac's `setenv.bat` file, and in the `trac.wsgi` file. However, these changes are not being recognized when I attempt to start the service.

Additionally, I cannot modify the permissions on the folder in Roaming using `chmod` (as in Linux), and I am unable to remove any more permissions from the folder (for myself, Administrators, and System) due to corporate IT policies that prevent removing Administrator access, which is a reasonable security measure.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that another service was running on port 8080, which I had configured for Trac. This was the actual cause of the problem, although the error in the logs did not indicate this.
