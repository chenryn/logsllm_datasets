User: How to use Python to implement a simple web application? Please give sample code and framework.
Assistant: Python can implement simple web applications through a variety of frameworks, the most commonly used ones include Django, Flask, and Bottle. Here is an example of a simple Flask application: ``` from flask import Flask, render_template app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def home(): return 'Welcome to my Flask app!' @app. route('/hello/<name>') def hello(name): return render_template('hello.html', name=name) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run() ``` The sample application includes two routes: / (root directory) and /hello/<name>. When the user visits the root directory, the app returns "Welcome to my Flask app!", and when the user visits /hello/<name>, it returns a rendered HTML page including the name (passed by the user). This program also uses the features of Flask blueprints (blueprint), which can help classify and organize routing logic, making web applications more structured. In this example, we use the hello.html file in the templates/ directory as the HTML template file. Flask uses the Jinja2 language, which can easily render the passed parameters into the template. To run this application, execute the command python app.py. This will start Flask's development server and start listening for requests from the browser. Flask is a very flexible and open framework on which users can build various components that meet application requirements. With just a webbrowser and web services, users can easily start building their own web applications.
