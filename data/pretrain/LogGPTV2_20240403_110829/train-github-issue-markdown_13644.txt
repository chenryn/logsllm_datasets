Currently Playwright generates a uuid-style filename
We're using Playright to record out tests in a pipeline which is providing
excellent visual feedback thank you!
https://github.com/Subscribie/subscribie/actions/runs/462234262 (please see
artifacts)
It's very valuable to visually see when/why a test fails as a video- so we
start / stop a video recording for each test.
As you can see from the artifacts, it's hard to tell which video is which
without being able to name the video file during record. Is there a
mechanism/recommended way to do this?
