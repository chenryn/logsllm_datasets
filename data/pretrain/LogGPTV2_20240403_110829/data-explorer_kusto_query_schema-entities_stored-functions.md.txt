# Stored Functions

::: zone pivot="azuredataexplorer, azuremonitor"

Functions are reusable queries or query parts that can be stored as database entities, similar to tables. These are known as *stored functions*. Alternatively, you can create functions on the fly using a [let statement](../let-statement.md), which are referred to as *query-defined functions*. For more information, see [user-defined functions](../functions/user-defined-functions.md).

To create and manage stored functions, refer to the [Stored functions management overview](../../management/functions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To enable a stored function to participate in `search *` and `union *` scenarios, define it as a [view](../../query/schema-entities/views.md).
