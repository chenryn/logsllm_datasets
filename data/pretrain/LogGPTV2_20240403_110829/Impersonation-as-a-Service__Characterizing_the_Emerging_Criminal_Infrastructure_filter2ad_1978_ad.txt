this observation (𝑝 < 0.0001). The high median price in Mauritania
(26 USD) is caused by only one profile (with no fingerprints, two
browsers, and four thousand cookies) available for that country.
The rate of appearance of new and updated user profiles on
ImpaaS.ru is depicted in Figure 3. A clear upwards trends in terms
of number of available profiles is visible, with a large jump in avail-
able profiles in November 2019 (coinciding with the 2019 spike in
phishing campaigns distributing AZORult [6, 19, 30]). Overall, in
Figure 3 we observe a sustained rate of new (black bar) and updated
(orange bar) profiles, suggesting that the platform is systematically
updating existing profiles, while adding new ones to the platform
portfolio. We further investigate the time passing between time of

infection and (last) profile updates; Figure 4 shows the boxplot dis-
tribution of time passed between the infection and the last update
received by the platform, plotted against the date of installation;
in red, the upper bound of the maximum possible time in between.
Overall the distribution appears relatively stable, with a median up-
date time ranging between ten hours and four days. Unsurprisingly,
recently acquired profiles are updated only after a few hours from
acquisition; overall, the distribution suggests that profiles are kept
updated on average over an extended period of time, ranging from
a few days, to several months at the extreme of the distribution.
5.1.1 Analysis of profile values. Figure 5 reports the moving av-
erage of user profile prices as a function of time. The value of the
traded profiles steadily increases as time passes, a signal of growth
of the platform. In particular, profile prices seem to have doubled
since November 2019, perhaps as an effect of the updated malware
released in that period discussed at the start of this Section. Figure 6
reports the relation between the number of available Fingerprints
in a profile and its price. The effect of an increased number of avail-
able fingerprints is, albeit positive, very limited. The average price
seems to stabilize around the median value of 5 USD regardless of
the number of fingerprints available in the profile, suggesting once
again that other variables could be at play. We find no correlation
between number of available browser and number of cookies and
prices. This is not surprising, as these dimensions express little in
terms of which identities of the victim the attacker may affect.
To further look at factors that may determine the value of a
profile, we look at the impact of the geographic location to which the
profile is linked. To do so, we investigate the relation between (log-
transformed) profile prices and the wealth of the country in which
the profile is located, expressed in terms of (log) GDP per capita (as
reported by the World Development Indicators [4]). The intuition is
that, the more ‘valuable’ a target is perceived to be, the greater the
value of the corresponding profiles might be. Figure 7 reports the
analysis. A positive and statistically significant correlation emerges,
suggesting that profile prices are indeed correlated to the wealth
of the respective country, perhaps a sign of the perceived value of
that user profile (𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 0.4, 𝑝 < 0.001).
We note that some user profiles on ImpaaS.ru appear to be dis-
counted at a rate of 30%. We do not find a clear-cut effect explaining
which profiles are likely to be discounted (Table 6 in the Appendix).
5.2 The impact of Resources on profile pricing
We first look at the distribution of resource types in the Sampled
dataset. As for the Full dataset, we remove from further anal-
ysis profiles that aren’t associated to at least a browser of the vic-
tim’s system and, in addition, profiles that don’t contain any stolen
resource, limiting the size of the dataset to 𝑛 = 12′052. Table 4 pro-
vides an overview of the distribution of user profiles per category.
Note that a profile can have resources that belong to more than
one category. Overall, Services is the most commonly available
resource type across user profiles. Resources in the Social and
Commerce categories are also common, with respectively about 70%
and 40% of user profiles with resources in these categories. Ap-
proximately 25% of the profiles have data for banking and payment
accounts; by contrast, less than 2% of user profiles have resources
in the Cryptocurrency category. Only 4.5% of the resources in our

dataset were classified as Other, indicating that the proposed clas-
sification covers the vast majority of resource types in ImpaaS.ru.
Figure 8 provides a first overview of the relation between the
number of resources available in a profile and the associated price.
A clear correlation emerges. The depicted linear log-log relation
indicates negative marginal returns for each added resource, mean-
ing that every additional resource added to a profile provide an
increasingly smaller, albeit positive, added value to the profile. Fur-
ther exploring the impact of resources on pricing, Figure 9 shows
the impact of the presence of resources in any specific category
on the value of a user profile. Note that, because each profile can
contain resources of more than one category, one cannot isolate the
relative importance of each category here. However, the compari-
son shows how, on average, a profile that contains (also) resources
in that category is priced versus other profiles that do not have it.
This is meaningful as the categories show relatively low correla-
tions (reported in Table 7 in the appendix). On average, profiles

that include Cryptocurrency resources seem to be the most valu-
able. Money transfer and Commerce resources belong to profiles
of approximately the same value, whereas profiles with Social
and Services are the least valued in ImpaaS.ru. By comparing
the relative ‘jump’ introduced by the addition of each category,
one can further evaluate the added value, on average, of having a
resource of that type. In this respect, Other appears to be the least
‘impactful’ category, as the appearance of a resource of this type
is related to the smallest relative increase in price, on average, in
a profile. On the contrary, Cryptocurrency and Money transfer
resources cause the highest jump in profile value, passing from
a median value of approximately 7 USD to more than 20. Other
categories show less extreme changes in price. Overall, we find that
resources associated to financial platforms and services appear to
+ 𝛽5Commerce𝑖 + 𝛽6Social𝑖
+ 𝛽7Services𝑖 + 𝛽8Other𝑖
𝑀4 : 𝑦𝑖 = . . . + 𝛽9resourcesi
have the highest impact on the value of a profile, with Social and
Services being the least valued. On the other hand, the addition
of resources of any category appears to have a positive impact on
the value of a profile.
To formally evaluate this relation, we build a set of linear regres-
sion models to quantify the effect of different profile features on
profile values in ImpaaS.ru. To evaluate the effect of each factor
independently, and monitor its relation to other characteristics of a
user profile, we define the following nested models with response
variable 𝑦 = 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 (the error term 𝜖𝑖 is omitted for brevity):
𝑀1 : 𝑦𝑖 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1Real fingerprintsi
𝑀2 : 𝑦𝑖 = . . . + 𝛽2 log(GDPi)
𝑀3 : 𝑦𝑖 = . . . + 𝛽3Cryptocurrency𝑖 + 𝛽4Money transfer𝑖
where 𝛽0 is the intercept, Real fingerprints is the number of
fingerprints embedded in that user profile, log(GDP) is the natural
logarithm of the gross domestic product per capita for the country
associated with the user profile, {Cryptocurrency . . . Other} are
dummy variables representing the presence of resources of the
corresponding category, and resources is the overall number of
resources in that profile (irrespective of category).
Regression results are summarized in Table 5. To evaluate the
effects of profile characteristics on full prices we remove profiles
‘on sale’ from the dataset. Table 8 and Table 9 in the appendix report,
respectively, a full breakdown of the variables’ impact on the predic-
tion, and the regression results for all data points including profiles
on ‘sale’; both tables report results quantitatively and qualitatively
in line with those reported in Table 5. Overall, the coefficient es-
timates appear stable across the models, with the exception of 𝛽2
(log(GDP)), that becomes less important on the estimation of the
dependent variable price as the types of Resources are added to
the model. The change ranges from an expected increase of 0.2
USD in profile value for every 10% increase in GDP (𝛽2 = 2.29 in
M2, 2.29× log(1.10) = 0.22), to a relatively smaller (0.04 USD) price
increase when all resource categories are added in the model. This
indicates that some resource categories may appear more frequently
for high GDP countries than for others; with reference to Table 8

in the appendix, it appears that resources of type Money transfer
and Commerce tend to appear more often in wealthy countries, as
most of the effect of the GDP variable disappears when this cat-
egory is accounted for, while the opposite effect emerges when
Social resources are included in the model. Additional resource
categories have modest effects on the GDP coefficient estimate. As
resource categories are added to the model, the impact of the num-
ber of fingerprints increases, passing from a 0.55 USD increase in
expected profile value for each additional fingerprint in the profile
(𝛽1 = 0.55) to a 1.31 USD increase estimated by M3. This suggests a
positive joint effect of the number of fingerprints in a profile, and
the number of platforms with resources an attacker can employ to
impersonate a victim. All resources have a positive effect on the
value of a user profile with Cryptocurrency and Money transfer
having the highest impact, increasing the expected value of 13.62
and 8.86 USD respectively when available. Following this trend,
Commerce shows a relatively large effect as well, increasing the
profiles’ expected value of 5.06 USD. These findings may not come
as a surprise, and may indicate that ImpaaS.ru customers may be
primarily aiming at economical profit (supporting insights from ob-
serving ImpaaS.ru customers discussing on a dedicated Telegram
channel, see Sec. 6.2 for an informal report). Finally, the effect of the
number of resources in M4 is significant and positive; interestingly,
its addition decreases the effect of the single resource categories,
confirming the intuition that the more platforms an attacker can
impersonate, the higher the value of the profile.8
In all, resource types appear to explain the majority of the vari-
ance in the model, with Money transfer accounting for a jump
in more than 30% in the model (adjusted) 𝑅2 when compared with
previous model. The complete model explains most of the price
variance in our dataset (𝑅2 = 0.79), suggesting that the model pro-
vides an appropriate description of the features determining user
profile values in ImpaaS.ru.
6 DISCUSSION
In this paper we presented the IMPaaS model as a novel threat en-
abling attackers to perform user impersonation at scale. IMPaaS is
supported by an emergent criminal infrastructure that controls the
supply chain of user profiles, from system infection to profile ac-
quisition and commodification. Whereas traditional impersonation
attacks relying solely on stolen credentials are greatly mitigated by
risk-based and two-factor authentication systems, the capability of
seamlessly reproducing a user’s ‘appearance’ to an authentication
system allows attackers to systematically compromise accounts of
multiple users, across multiple platforms.
Whereas Thomas et al. already suggested that user profiling
could be used to bypass modern authentication systems [40], in
this work we provide evidence of an emergent as-a-service imper-
sonation model that appears to be rapidly expanding. The profile
value analysis provided in Section 5.2 suggests a mature pricing
model, which may indicate that the analyzed platform operations
are of stable, predictable quality, and likely to expand in number.
Overall, the analysis of the available user profiles on ImpaaS.ru
and the reportedly widespread adoption of info-stealer malware
such as AZORult in phishing campaigns [19, 29] provide further
supporting evidence of the growth of this threat model.
Our analysis of ImpaaS.ru allows us to further quantify the
relative effects of different resources on the value of a user profile.
Interestingly, albeit perhaps not surprisingly, we find that profile
values show a significant correlation with the wealth of the country
(expressed in terms of GDP) associated to that profile; this suggests
that attackers looking to impersonate and, likely, monetize user
profiles assign a greater value to profiles likely to give access to
greater financial resources (e.g., bank balances or valid credit cards).
Interestingly, this effect is significantly reduced by the presence
of Commerce resources in a profile, perhaps due to the prevalence
of e-commerce platforms in wealthy countries. Nonetheless, other
resource categories have a clear impact on the overall valuation of a
user profile, with Cryptocurrency and Money transfer resources
driving most of the value. Real fingerprints (those derived directly
from the device, rather than being synthesized by the IMPaaS plat-
form using the profile’s metadata) available in a profile also add
value to the user profile. Our analysis suggests that each real fin-
gerprints adds about 0.55 USD to the value of a user profile, and up
to 1.31 USD when considered jointly with the available resources,
8Driven by observations in Chen et al. [12], who identified cookies as having a key
role in behavioral fingerprinting practices, we find that in terms of profile pricing the
availability of cookies does not show a statistically significant effect (Anova 𝐹1.92, 𝑝 =
0.17) in our dataset, suggesting that cookies do not play a central role in impersonation
attacks as driven by ImpaaS.ru.
suggesting that the modus operandi enabled by IMPaaS described
in Figure 1 is supported by the platform operations.
Importantly, our analysis allows us to put a number on the value
of user information to attackers, contributing to the literature on
