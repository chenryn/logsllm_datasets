# Phase 3: Make it Hard to Get In

In this phase, you will significantly increase the difficulty for attackers to gain access to your on-premises or cloud infrastructures by systematically eliminating vulnerabilities at key entry points.

> [!Important]
> While many of these steps may be familiar and easy to implement, it is crucial that **your work on Phase 3 should not slow down your progress on Phases 1 and 2**!

## Remote Access

Gaining access to your organization's intranet through a remote access connection is a common attack vector for ransomware. Once an on-premises user account is compromised, an attacker can freely roam the intranet, gather intelligence, elevate privileges, and install ransomware. The 2021 Colonial Pipeline cyberattack is a notable example.

### Program and Project Member Accountabilities for Remote Access

This table outlines the responsibilities for protecting your remote access solution from ransomware, organized by a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy.

| Lead | Implementor | Accountability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CISO or CIO | - | Executive Sponsorship |
| Program Lead (Central IT Infrastructure/Network Team) | - | Drive Results and Cross-Team Collaboration |
| - | IT and Security Architects | Prioritize Component Integration into Architectures |
| - | Central IT Identity Team | Configure Microsoft Entra ID and Conditional Access Policies |
| - | Central IT Operations | Implement Changes to Environment |
| - | Workload Owners | Assist with RBAC Permissions for App Publishing |
| - | Security Policy and Standards | Update Standards and Policy Documents |
| - | Security Compliance Management | Monitor to Ensure Compliance |
| - | User Education Team | Update Guidance on Workflow Changes and Perform Education and Change Management |

### Implementation Checklist for Remote Access

Apply these best practices to protect your remote access infrastructure from ransomware attackers.

| Done | Task | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - | Maintain software and appliance updates. Avoid missing or neglecting manufacturer protections (security updates, supported status). | Attackers often exploit well-known vulnerabilities that have not been patched. |
| - | Configure Microsoft Entra ID for existing remote access, including enforcing Zero Trust user and device validation with Conditional Access. | Zero Trust provides multiple layers of security for accessing your organization. |
| - | Configure security for existing third-party VPN solutions (e.g., Cisco AnyConnect, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN, Citrix NetScaler, Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), etc.). | Leverage the built-in security features of your remote access solution. |
| - | Deploy Azure Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN to provide remote access. | Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID and your existing Azure subscriptions. |
| - | Publish on-premises web apps with Microsoft Entra application proxy. | Apps published with the proxy do not require a remote access connection. |
| - | Secure access to Azure resources with Azure Bastion. | Connect securely and seamlessly to your Azure virtual machines over SSL. |
| - | Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)). | Reduce risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings. |

## Email and Collaboration

Implement best practices for email and collaboration solutions to make it more difficult for attackers to abuse them, while still allowing your workers to access external content easily and safely. Attackers frequently use authorized collaboration tools like email and file sharing to transfer malicious content and convince users to run it. Microsoft has developed enhanced mitigations to increase protection against these attack vectors.

### Program and Project Member Accountabilities for Email and Collaboration

This table describes the overall protection of your email and collaboration solutions from ransomware, organized by a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy.

| Lead | Implementor | Accountability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CISO, CIO, or Identity Director | - | Executive Sponsorship |
| Program Lead (Security Architecture Team) | - | Drive Results and Cross-Team Collaboration |
| - | IT Architects | Prioritize Component Integration into Architectures |
| - | Cloud Productivity or End User Team | Enable Defender for Office 365, ASR, and AMSI |
| - | Security Architecture / Infrastructure + Endpoint | Configuration Assistance |
| - | User Education Team | Update Guidance on Workflow Changes |
| - | Security Policy and Standards | Update Standards and Policy Documents |
| - | Security Compliance Management | Monitor to Ensure Compliance |

### Implementation Checklist for Email and Collaboration

Apply these best practices to protect your email and collaboration solutions from ransomware attackers.

| Done | Task | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - | Enable AMSI for Office VBA. | Detect Office macro attacks with endpoint tools like Defender for Endpoint. |
| - | Implement Advanced Email Security using Defender for Office 365 or a similar solution. | Email is a common entry point for attackers. |
| - | Deploy Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to block common attack techniques, such as credential theft, ransomware activity, and suspicious use of PsExec and WMI. | ASR provides additional layers of protection specifically targeted at mitigating common attack methods. |
| - | Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)). | Reduce risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings. |

## Endpoints

Implement relevant security features and rigorously follow software maintenance best practices for endpoints (devices) and applications, prioritizing those directly exposed to Internet traffic and content. Internet-exposed endpoints are a common entry vector for attackers, providing access to the organization's assets. Prioritize blocking common OS and application vulnerabilities with preventive controls to slow or stop the execution of the next stages of an attack.

### Program and Project Member Accountabilities for Endpoints

This table describes the overall protection of your endpoints from ransomware, organized by a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy.

| Lead | Implementor | Accountability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business Leadership (Accountable for Business Impact) | - | Executive Sponsorship (Maintenance) |
| Central IT Operations or CIO | - | Executive Sponsorship (Others) |
| Program Lead (Central IT Infrastructure Team) | - | Drive Results and Cross-Team Collaboration |
| - | IT and Security Architects | Prioritize Component Integration into Architectures |
| - | Central IT Operations | Implement Changes to Environment |

By following these guidelines, you can significantly enhance the security of your environment and make it much harder for attackers to gain access.
