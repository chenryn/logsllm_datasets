# Phase 3: Make it hard to get in
In this phase, you make the attackers work a lot harder to get into your on-premises or cloud infrastructures by incrementally removing the risks at the points of entry.
>[!Important]
>While many of these will be familiar and easy to quickly accomplish, itâ€™s critically important that **your work on Phase 3 should not slow down your progress on phases 1 and 2**!

## Remote access
Gaining access to your organization's intranet through a remote access connection is an attack vector for ransomware attackers. Once an on-premises user account is compromised, an attacker is free to roam on an intranet to gather intelligence, elevate privileges, and install ransomware. The Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in 2021 is an example.

### Implementation checklist for remote access
Apply these best practices to protect your remote access infrastructure from ransomware attackers.
|Done|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
||Maintain software and appliance updates. Avoid missing or neglecting manufacturer protections (security updates, supported status).|Attackers use well-known vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched as attack vectors.|
||Configure Microsoft Entra ID for existing remote access by including enforcing [Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) user and device validation with Conditional Access.|Zero Trust provides multiple levels of securing access to your organization.|
||Configure security for existing third-party VPN solutions (Cisco [AnyConnect](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/cisco-anyconnect), Palo Alto Networks [GlobalProtect](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/palo-alto-networks-globalprotect-tutorial) & [Captive Portal](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/paloaltonetworks-captiveportal-tutorial), Fortinet [FortiGate SSL VPN](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/fortigate-ssl-vpn-tutorial), Citrix [NetScaler](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/citrix-netscaler-tutorial), [Zscaler Private Access (ZPA)](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/zscalerprivateaccess-tutorial), and [more](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tutorial-list)).|Take advantage of the built-in security of your remote access solution.|
||Deploy [Azure Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant#enable-authentication) to provide remote access.|Take advantage of integration with Microsoft Entra ID and your existing Azure subscriptions.|
||Publish on-premises web apps with [Microsoft Entra application proxy](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services).|Apps published with Microsoft Entra application proxy do not need a remote access connection.|
||Secure access to Azure resources with [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview).|Securely and seamlessly connect to your Azure virtual machines over SSL.|
||Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)).|Reduce risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings.|
## Email and collaboration
Implement best practices for email and collaboration solutions to make it more difficult for attackers to abuse them, while allowing your workers to access external content easily and safely.
Attackers frequently enter the environment by transferring malicious content in with authorized collaboration tools such as email and file sharing and convincing users to run it. Microsoft has invested in enhanced mitigations that vastly increase protection against these attack vectors.
### Program and project member accountabilities for email and collaboration
This table describes the overall protection of your email and collaboration solutions from ransomware in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.

||IT Architects|Prioritize component integration into architectures|
||Cloud Productivity or End User Team|Enable Defender for Office 365, ASR, and AMSI|

### Implementation checklist for email and collaboration
Apply these best practices to protect your email and collaboration solutions from ransomware attackers.
|Done|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
||Enable [AMSI for Office VBA](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/09/12/office-vba-amsi-parting-the-veil-on-malicious-macros/).|Detect Office macro attacks with endpoint tools like [Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection).|
||Implement Advanced Email security using [Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/office-365-atp) or a similar solution.|Email is a common entry point for attackers.|
||[Deploy attack surface reduction (ASR) rules](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment) to block common attack techniques including:  - Endpoint abuse such as credential theft, ransomware activity, and suspicious use of PsExec and WMI.  - Weaponized Office document activity such as advanced macro activity, executable content, process creation, and process injection initiated by Office applications.  **Note:** Deploy these rules in audit mode first, then assess any negative impact, and then deploy them in block mode.|ASR provides additional layers of protect specifically targeted at mitigating common attack methods.|
||Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)).|Reduces risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings.|
## Endpoints
Implement relevant security features and rigorously follow software maintenance best practices for endpoints (devices) and applications, prioritizing applications and server/client operating systems directly exposed to Internet traffic and content.
Internet-exposed endpoints are a common entry vector that provides attackers access to the organization's assets. Prioritize blocking common OS and application vulnerabilities with preventive controls to slow or stop them from executing the next stages.
