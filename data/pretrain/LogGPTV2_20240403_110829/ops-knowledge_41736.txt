User: I'm trying to follow Zed Shaw's guide for Learning Python the Hard Way.  I need to use python in Powershell.  I have Python 2.7.3 installed in C:\Python27.  Whenever I type python into Powershell, I get an error that says the term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.  I also typed in this: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")
That was a suggested solution provided, but typing python into Powershell still does nothing.  I can type in "start python" and it opens up a window with python but I need it in Powershell.  Thanks.
Assistant: $env:path="$env:Path;C:\Python27" will only set it for the current session. Next time you open Powershell, you will have to do the same thing again.
The [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable() is the right way, and it would have set your PATH environment variable permanently. You just have to start Powershell again to see the effect in this case.
