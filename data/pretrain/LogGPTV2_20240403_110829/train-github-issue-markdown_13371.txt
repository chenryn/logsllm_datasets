Rust now supports `[]` in macro invocations, with a driving use case being
able to write `vec![0, 0, 0]` as analogy to the fixed sized vector syntax `[0,
0, 0]`.
However, there is no analogy to the `[0, ..n]` repeat syntax for it: `vec![0,
..n]` does not work.
~~For it to be added,`vec!` would either need to become a procedural macro, or
something like rust-lang/rfcs#88 needs to be implemented.~~
