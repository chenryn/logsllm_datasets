### Title: Black Hat US-21: Exploiting Secure Bootloaders

**Abstract:**
Bootloaders are critical components in protecting devices from executing malicious software, often employing signature verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the code. This talk aims to highlight actionable weaknesses in modern bootloaders that can be exploited to deploy unsigned code, despite these protective measures.

**Phase 1: Exploiting Android Smartphone Bootloaders**
In the first phase, we will delve into the vulnerabilities present in the bootloaders of modern Android smartphones. We will demonstrate how these weaknesses can be exploited to:
- Bypass bootloader unlocking restrictions.
- Decrypt protected user data.
- Deploy malicious software on devices with full disk encryption.

**Phase 2: Targeting Secondary Hardware Bootloaders**
In the second phase, we will focus on the bootloader vulnerabilities in secondary hardware, such as embedded RF chips used in smartphones. We will showcase reverse engineering techniques that reveal weaknesses in the signature verification mechanisms of the firmware update protocols. These vulnerabilities can be leveraged to deploy custom firmware to the chip, thereby compromising the device's security.

By the end of this talk, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the current state of bootloader security and the potential risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
