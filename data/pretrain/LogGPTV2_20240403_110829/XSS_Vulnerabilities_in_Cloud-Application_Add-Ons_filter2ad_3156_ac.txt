### Data Import and Security Vulnerabilities in Add-ons

#### Data Import Process
The add-on allows users to select a specific sheet and column from which they want to import data. A preview of the data in the selected column is also displayed. Once the user selects a sheet and a column, the add-on populates the question with the data from that column.

#### Security Vulnerability
The vulnerability lies in Step 4, where the add-on does not filter or escape the data from the selected spreadsheet document before rendering it as HTML. If an attacker has access to the document (e.g., as a collaborator), they can hide malicious JavaScript code in the part of the document that will be used as form inputs. This code will execute when the victim uses the add-on. Since the add-on uses the Picker API (Step 3), the attacker can steal its access token and gain all of its permissions, including:
- "See, edit, create, and delete all of your Google Drive files"
- "See, edit, create, and delete your spreadsheets in Google Drive"
- "View and manage your forms in Google Drive"
- "Send email as you"

The add-on has more permissions than necessary, such as the ability to send emails on the user’s behalf and access to all Google Drive files. This excess of permissions allows the attacker to access all of the victim’s Google Drive files and send emails on their behalf. The attacker could also phish for an OAuth 2.0 token to gain even more access rights, such as reading the victim’s emails.

### Shopify Add-ons

#### Overview
Shopify is an e-commerce platform that enables small merchants to create online shops. It offers services like payment, marketing, and customer engagement. Each shop is managed through a web admin interface, where the owner can access built-in services to add new products, engage with users, and manage orders. Shopify add-ons integrate third-party services into this admin interface.

#### Architecture
The add-on architecture, illustrated in Figure 6, involves an add-on server running in the cloud, accessing shop data via the Shopify REST APIs over HTTPS. The add-on server is authorized to access the shop server using an OAuth 2.0 access token. When the user first starts the add-on, the admin interface shows an authorization prompt listing the data the add-on requests to access. If the user agrees, the Shopify server sends an access token to a pre-registered endpoint on the add-on server. The add-on server can then use the token to access the requested data and renew the access tokens without further prompts.

#### Add-on UI and Permissions
The add-on UI is embedded into a menu in the shop’s admin interface. Shopify provides local JavaScript APIs for the add-on UI to perform resource-picking operations. The add-on UI communicates with the shop’s admin interface via `window.postMessage()`, and the admin interface asks the user to pick resources of the requested type, returning the result data objects to the add-on.

A shop can have an owner and multiple staff members. The owner has full access and can grant other staff members access to some or all admin features, including add-ons. The view through the add-on’s UI is based on the intersection of the member’s and the add-on’s permissions.

### XSS Exploits in Shopify Add-ons

#### Attack Vectors
For XSS exploits, the attacker must be a staff member who can inject malicious scripts into shop resources. While Shopify prevents including HTML or scripts in customer information, it is possible to inject scripts into product and order descriptions. These scripts will execute when other staff members use a vulnerable add-on that renders them unsafely.

#### Installing Malicious Add-ons
The attacker can trick the shop owner or another authorized user into installing a malicious add-on. Unlike MS Office Online and G Suite, where add-ons are installed from marketplaces, Shopify users can initiate the installation process by visiting a URL. The attacker can create a malicious add-on with a similar name to a vulnerable one and initiate its installation from an injected script. The victim might think the add-on has been updated and needs reauthorization. Depending on the permissions granted, the malicious add-on can access any shop data.

### Case Study: Order Printer Pro

Order Printer Pro is a popular add-on in the “Orders and shipping” category on the Shopify marketplace. It allows users to create, print, and deliver order-related documents. The workflow for printing an order is as follows:
1. The user starts the add-on from the admin interface.
2. The user selects the “Orders” menu.
3. The user selects the order to print.
4. The user clicks the “Print” button.

The issue with Order Printer Pro is that it does not render order notes safely. If the notes contain JavaScript snippets, they will execute, allowing any staff member with write access to perform XSS on other staff members, including the shop owner.

### Empirical Analysis

#### Shortlisting Add-ons
We considered only free add-ons from the marketplaces of MS Office Online, G Suite, and Shopify. We selected 100 free add-ons from each marketplace—50 popular ones and 50 random ones—resulting in 300 add-ons for the study.

#### Analysis Methodology
We manually analyzed the selected add-ons using black-box testing. Automated techniques for detecting XSS vulnerabilities typically work only with client-side XSS, while the nature of XSS attacks against cloud-application add-ons varies depending on the host application and add-on implementation. Additionally, most functionality of an add-on can only be triggered by user actions, and many add-ons require user login, making automated detection challenging.

#### Black-Box Testing
For each add-on, we installed it and created test items for the target applications, adding JavaScript snippets to every part of the document, email, or shop item. We found several vulnerable add-ons, as detailed in Table 4.
