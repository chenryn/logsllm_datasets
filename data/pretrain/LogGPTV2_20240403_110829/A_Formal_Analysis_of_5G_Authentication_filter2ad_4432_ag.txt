it tries to establish agreement on data t with a whose role is A). The
above property is modelled as follows.
Definition C.3. Non-injective agreement on data t of a role A
towards a role B is modeled via the following formula:
∀a b t #i. Claim_commit_agr(a, b, ⟨A, B, ts⟩)@i ⇒
(∃#j. Claim_running_agr(b, a, ⟨A, B, ts⟩)@j).
D SECURITY ASSUMPTIONS AND GOALS
This section extends Section 3.
This section is dedicated to our interpretation of security assump-
tions and goals that are relevant to authentication methods in 5G as
precise formal statements. We shall support our interpretation by
relevant excerpts from Technical Specification (TS) documents and
Technical Requirement (TR) documents issued by 3GPP. Note that
we may cite documents specifying aspects of earlier generations
(3G and 4G) when relevant.
D.1 Security Assumptions and Threat Model
D.1.1 Assumptions on Channels.
Channel SN-HN. As part of the E2E core network, the channel
between the SN and HN is supposed to provide confidentiality,
integrity, authenticity, and, replay protection. Those assumptions
are explicitly specified:
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.9.3] Requirements for E2E core net-
work interconnection security:
• The solution shall provide confidentiality and/or integrity
end-to-end between source and destination network for
specific message elements identified in the present docu-
ment. For this requirement to be fulfilled, the SEPP - cf [2],
clause 6.2.17 shall be present at the edge of the source and
destination networks dedicated to handling e2e Core Net-
work Interconnection Security. The confidentiality and/or
integrity for the message elements is provided between two
SEPPs of the source and destination PLMN-.
• The destination network shall be able to determine the
authenticity of the source network that sent the specific
message elements protected according to the preceding
bullet. For this requirement to be fulfilled, it shall suffice
that a SEPP in the destination network that is dedicated to
handling e2e Core Network Interconnection Security can
determine the authenticity of the source network.
• The solution shall cover prevention of replay attacks.
Channel Subscribers-SNs. The channel between the subscribers
and SNs, on the radio physical layer, is subject to eavesdropping
(by passive attackers) or manipulations, interception, and injection
of messages (by an active attacker). A passive attacker listens to
signaling messages (i.e., messages sent on the radio physical layer)
on specific bandwidths and can therefore easily eavesdrop on all
messages exchanged in its vicinity. An active attacker sets up a
fake base station to receive and send signaling messages; e.g., to
impersonate SNs. While no 5G-specific hardware is publicly avail-
able yet, we recall how easily an attacker can set-up fake base
stations in 4G using open-source and freely available software and
17
hardware [23, 35]. From now on, we shall consider active attackers,
except when explicitly stated otherwise.
D.1.2 Assumptions on Cryptographic Primitives. According to
[TS 33.102, Sec. 3.2,6.3.2], the functions f1, f1∗, f2 are message au-
thentication functions while f3, f4, f5, f5∗ are key derivation func-
tions. To the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized, explicit
security requirements for these functions. One could infer from
the informal presentation [TS 33.102, Sec. 3.2] that the former are
integrity protected and the latter are integrity and confidentiality
protected. However, since f1 and f1∗ are used to MAC sensitive
pieces of data such as SQN (see the Section dedicated to privacy in
Appendix D.2.3), it is our understanding that they should addition-
ally preserve the confidentiality of their inputs.
Therefore, we assume f1, f1∗, f3, f4, f5, f5∗ are integrity and con-
fidentiality protected while f2 is integrity protected. We also stress
that f1 and f1∗ are underspecified.
D.1.3 Assumptions on Parties. We consider compromised scenarios
in order to provide stronger and more fine-grained guarantees. Our
analyses will be parametrized by those compromised scenarios; in
the worst case, a property will hold only when the attacker cannot
compromise any agent. First, we consider an attacker who can
compromise certain SNs. This means that the attacker gets access
to an authenticated channel between the compromised SN and
HNs, which he can use to eavesdrop on and inject messages. This
is a reasonable assumption in 5G, where authentication methods
should provide security guarantees even in presence of genuine but
malicious SNs. In such situations, the HNs may cooperate with such
SNs to authenticate some subscriber. In practice, this may happen
in roaming situations. The following excerpt shows that in 5G, this
is a threat model that should be considered (home refers to HN and
visited network refers to SN):
[TS 33.501, Sec. 6.1.4.1] Increased home control: The au-
thentication and key agreement protocols mandated to pro-
vide increased home control [compared to previous gen-
erations]. The feature of increased home control is use-
ful in preventing certain types of fraud, e.g. fraudulent
Nudm_UECM_Registration Request for registering the sub-
scriber’s serving AMF in UDM that are not actually present
in the visited network.
Furthermore, we consider that the attacker may have genuine
USIMs and compromised USIMs under its control. For those com-
promised subscribers, the attacker can access all secret values stored
in the USIMs; i.e., SUPI, K, and SQN. Finally, the attacker can access
all long-term secrets K, skHN, and SUPI from compromised HNs.
D.1.4 Assumptions on Data Protection.
Subscriber credentials. The subscriber credentials, notably the
key K and the identifier SUPI, shared between subscribers and HNs,
should be initially secret (provided they belong to uncompromised
agents):
[TS 33.501, Sec. 3.1] Subscription credential(s): set of val-
ues in the USIM and the ARPF, consisting of at least the
long-term key(s) and the subscription identifier SUPI, used to
A Formal Analysis of 5G Authentication

uniquely identify a subscription and to mutually authenticate
the UE and 5G core network.
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.2.4] The following requirements apply
for the storage and processing of the subscription cre-
dentials used to access the 5G network:
• The subscription credential(s) shall be integrity protected
within the UE using a tamper resistant secure hardware
component.
• The long-term key(s) of the subscription credential(s) (i.e.
K) shall be confidentiality protected within the UE using a
tamper resistant secure hardware component.
• The long-term key(s) of the subscription credential(s) shall
never be available in the clear outside of the tamper resis-
tant secure hardware component.
• The authentication algorithm(s) that make use of the sub-
scription credentials shall always be executed within the
tamper resistant secure hardware component.
• It shall be possible to perform a security evaluation / assess-
ment according to the respective security requirements of
the tamper resistant secure hardware component.
NOTE: The security assessement scheme used for the se-
curity evaluation of the tamper resistant secure hardware
component is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
Sequence Number. The sequence number SQN is a 48-bit counter
(a 43-bits counter in some situations, see [TS 33.102, Sec. C.3.2]),
therefore guessable with a very low probability. We consider a
reasonable threat model where the value of SQN is unknown to the
attacker when the attack starts, but the attacker knows how it is
incremented during the attack. This corresponds to an attacker who
(i) can monitor the activity of targeted subscribers in its vicinity
during the attack but, (ii) cannot guess the initial value of SQN, (iii)
nor he can monitor targeted subscribers all the time (i.e., from the
very first use of the USIM up to the attack time).
[TS 33.102, Sec. 6.3.7] (3G) Sequence numbers (SQN) shall
have a length of 48 bits.
Other data. While not explicitly stated in the specification, we
shall assume that the private asymmetric key skHN is initially pri-
vate.
D.2 Security Requirements
We now extract and interpret from the 5G documents the security
goals the authentication method 5G-AKA should achieve according
to the 5G standard.
D.2.1 Authentication Properties. 5G specifications make semi-formal
claims about authentication properties at different places in the doc-
uments. We have identified relevant claims and translate them into
formal security goals, indicated in purple and cursive text. When
doing this, we rely on Lowe’s taxonomy of authentication proper-
ties [28]. The first benefit is that the Lowe’s taxonomy provides pre-
cise properties that are now well established and understood, which
can very often clarify an ambiguity [7]. The second benefit is that
18
there exists a formal relation between the Lowe’s taxononmy and
mathematical definitions of security properties that can be directly
modeled in Tamarin [1]. We give an overview of this taxonomy
and its relation with mathematical formulations in Appendix C.
Intuitively, it specifies, from an agent A’s point of view, four levels
of authentication between two agents A and B: (i) aliveness, which
only ensures that B has been running the protocol previously, but
not necessarily with A; (ii) weak agreement, which ensures that B
has previously been running the protocol with A, but not necessar-
ily with the same data; (iii) non-injective agreement, which ensures
that B has been running the protocol with A and both agree on the
data; and (iv) injective agreement, which additionally ensures that
for each run of the protocol of an agent there is a unique matching
run of the other agent, which prevents replay attacks.
We start by recalling the (informal) goals of authentication meth-
ods in 5G:
[TS 33.501, Sec. 6.1.1.1] The purpose of the primary authen-
tication and key agreement procedures is to enable mutual
authentication between the UE and the network and provide
keying material that can be used between the UE and net-
work in subsequent security procedures. The keying material
generated by the primary authentication and key agreement
procedure results in an anchor key called the KSEAF provided
by the AUSF of the home network to the SEAF of the serving
network.
As we shall see, 5G aims at providing stronger guarantees than
in older generations, e.g., than in 3G:
corroborates the user identity of the user;
[TS 133.102, Sec. 5.1.2] (3G) The following security features
related to entity authentication are provided:
• user authentication: the property that the serving network
• network authentication: the property that the user corrob-
orates that he is connected to a serving network that is
authorised by the user’s HE to provide him services; this
includes the guarantee that this authorisation is recent.
