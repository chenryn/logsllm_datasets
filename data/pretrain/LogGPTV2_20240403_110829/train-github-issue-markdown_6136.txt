### Bug report
**Bug summary**  
In OSX using a Jupyter notebook with Matplotlib 2.0.2 and inline display,
subplots apparently render after all the code in a cell has executed. The
result is that if an object changes between one subplot plot call and the
next, only the newest object is shown in both subplots.
**This is fixed in 2.0.2, but I'm posting this issue for folks that might run
into this.**
**Code for reproduction**
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    A = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
    B = A.copy()
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,3)
    ax0, ax1, ax2 = axes
    ax0.matshow(A)
    A[0,0] = 9
    ax1.matshow(B)
    ax2.matshow(A)
    # Expected behavior - first and second subplots are the same.
    # Observed behavior - first and third subplots are the same.
**Actual outcome**

**Expected outcome**  
I would expect the first and second subplots to be the same.
