of complementarity between them, the new approach 
questions the posture of public authorities and the 
way public development programs are conducted. 
In the hypothesis of development by micro-projects 
observed through the experimentation carried out 
with the two schools, the role of public authorities 
evolve from top-down initiator of urban development 
to an open governance posture. This expression of open 
governance refers to the notions of open government 
where citizens have access to data and proceedings on 
public authorities actions, or of open-source governance 
where policy-making is open to citizens’ involvement 
towards an improved democratic process. Beyond 
the transparency of governance and its accessibility 
to public participation that bottom-up development 
by micro-projects induces, the open governance 
refers to a governance as an open and continuous 
action-research where core idea is less focused on 
decision making and more on the animation of the 
stakeholders participation process. It also changes the 
roles and posture of public authorities introducing 
Scenarios based on a 
mosaic of micro-visions 
starting from the users 
point of view generate a 
collective projection on the 
territory radically different 
from the programmatic 
appraoch that usually starts 
with generating urban 
infrastructures to prompt 
new ways of living.
two different notions: the role of shifting meaning and 
giving visibility to bottom-up initiatives on the one 
hand and on the other and the posture of back-up of 
the micro-projects initiatives. 
One of the scenarios produced by the students focused the EPPS structure itself and suggested how design 
and urban planning could integrate in more user centered local development.

3.2.1 Shifting meanings and giving visibility to bottom-up 
initiatives  
In both experimentations students of the two design 
schools starts with searching for local potentialities. 
They map social initiatives and bottom-up innovations. 
They bring into the light small size phenomenons that 
are otherwise regarded as endogenous developments 
or niches to social mainstream. This action of bringing 
into the light is two fold. First it consists in giving voice 
and publicity to actions that otherwise for their sizes 
and eccentric nature would not attract attention. Second 
and more important, they change the meaning of these 
actions and play a role of interpreters (Jégou & all, 
2006) showing them not only in the light but also under 
a different light: difficulties are turned into solutions, 
antagonisms into partnerships but also localized 
ideas assume the value of general opportunities and 
initiatives triggered by various motivations may appear 
promising in terms of sustainable and inclusive ways of 
living. The concepts of Diffused campus in Saint-Gilles 
and in a certain measure the concept of Paris-Saclay 
campus as a region-wide living lab are examples of 
these actions of shifting light on the current situation 
(i.e. a potential conflict between local population 
and respectively incoming students or researchers) 
and show it under a different and more positive 
perspective (i.e. respectively an intergenerational 
dynamic campus and a experimental neighbourhood 
of the future). Each of the single initiatives on which 
the micro-projects are based are also tentative changes 
of meanings, mixes and hybridations: collaborative 
services between inhabitants and students; schools and 
campus infrastructures hosting neighbourhood life; 
quasi-adoptions between local families and incoming 
students, etc. 
In a similar way to what the two groups of students 
have done, public authorities roles in the context 
of the development by micro-projects is to explore 
existing assets of the territory showing weak signals 
under the light of faits porteurs d’avenirs.       
3.2.2 Back-up posture of micro-projects
Public authorities traditionally (for sure in France 
and Belgium) think their role an initiator of local 
development and territorial transformation. Citizens 
are beneficiaries (often passive beneficiaries) of 
the resulting public service. More recently citizen 
participation is modulating the top-down government 
into forms of participative governance. 
The two experimentations conducted by the schools 
are showing one step further of an intrinsically 
bottom-up construction of the territory by an 
assembling of meaningful micro-projects in synergies. 
The development of the territory is a resulting process 
of this assembling and the governance is necessarily 
in an enabling or backup posture nearly opposite to 
the traditional role of initiator of public authorities 
described before. 
Public authorities should therefore aim at providing 
an enabling framework (Jégou, Manzini, 2008) or the 
appropriated conditions and ambience to enable 
the proper development of social innovations. In 
The two experimentations 
conducted by the schools are

of an instrinsically bottom-
up construction of the 
territory by an assembling 
of meaningful micro-project 
synergies.
the same way as for social innovation, the micro-
projects designed by the two schools students are 
intrinsically based on people dynamics and initiatives: 
collaborative services, mutual help and synergies 
between local institutions and inhabitants; successful 
shift of the identity of a territory into an open campus 
or an experimental living lab, etc, can hardly be 
prompted by public authorities. On the contrary, public 
authorities can explore, watch and gently support 
and orient these emerging initiatives. In other words, 
the different scenarios built within the collaboration 
between local stakeholders and design students may 
grow from such co-creation processes if they meet 
favourable environments. First and certainly more 
critical is the administrative and legislative flexibility. 
The proposed scenarios are different from current 
practices. They slightly change established rules. 
They push boundaries and goes countertrend. Public 
services and policy-making should therefore carefully 
watch the needs of the promising micro-projects, 
150
anticipate with them possible blockers and play a role 
of barrier remover. Second dimension of the public 
enabling framework is to provide the conditions 
to facilitate the development and consolidation 
of the social dynamics. Here comes requirement 
for measured forms of subsidies, technical help of 
experts and professionals (including urban planners 
and designers that may play key roles as enablers, 
interpreters and amplifiers) and support for permanent 
assessment and reorientation of this open governance.
4. DEVELOPMENT AGENCY LABS
The first experimentation between Paris-Saclay 
and ENSCI Paris DESIS Lab will further develop 
to investigate and experiment how user-centred 
design approach may transform territorial planning 
organizing an immersion session of students from 
different disciplines at the EPPS development 
agency. The aim is to work with urban planners and 
co-develop new integrated methods based on the 
previous experiences. One of the scenarios developed 
by the students proposes a vision for an urban and 
economic development agency as a public innovation 
place switching from consultation to co-creation 
through the generation of DEVELOPMENT AGENCYlabs 
putting the social architecture first and channelling 
then the appropriate urban infrastructure. 
This scenario is reproduced here as it applies the ideas 
developed before and proposes a conclusion in form of 
a vision before drawing design and policy implications.  
From the launch of Paris-Saclay Cluster Campus, major 
issues were clearly to kick-off the social dimensions of the 
project and generate a high quality of life between the 
mix of populations living there.
The Paris-Saclay Development Agency in charge of 
coordination of urban planning for the whole Campus 
decided to challenge its own work and innovation 
processes to better meet the social side of the project. 
The willingness to pass from consultation to co-
creation made them generate the first DEVELOPMENT 
AGENCYlabs: these new sub-structures worked as 
temporary project groups bringing together generally 
3 to 5 different stakeholders to coproduce an 
experimentation. For instance the first Learning Center 
around Politecnique metro station trigger appetite for 
more of such experimental third places: ‘La Villette-
Saclay’ was the first initiated by the Sciences and 
Industry Museum, NanoInnov and Ile-de-France Region 
Direction of Education. Another started in partnership 
with Minatech Arts & Science Atelier, CEA and Cartier 
Foundation. Each of these DEVELOPMENT AGENCYlabs 
real scale experimentations were scheduled for 6 months 
after which an assessment of the results is made by the 
partners and the experimentation is transformed into a 
real project or stopped. 
Other third places were generated around logging: 
Accord Hotel, Booking.com and Gites de France explored 
the concept of diffused hotels rooms at people’s 
home; Steelcase Strafor, the Hub and Cafés Costes 
implement the very French ‘Bistr’offices’, etc.
With DEVELOPMENT AGENCYlabs, the Development 
Agency turned planning upside down putting the social 
architecture first and channelling then the appropriate 
infrastructure.

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
The experiences conducted by design approaches to urban planning revealed some 
promising directions of development:
• 
Intensification of in-depth and long immersions into the territorial social fabric 
beyond classical user-centred approaches and tools;
Co-creation as enabling and supporting innovation by the population and 
stakeholders beyond limited involvement of creating with them;
Forward looking activities based on bottom-up generation of macro-visions 
from the aggregation of multiple single micro-projects; 
Support the deliberation and public participation with explicit representations 
of the future visions to be debated.
• 
• 
• 
DESIGN EDUCATION
The experiences conducted pointed a series of open questions for design schools:
• 
The value of the design approaches and tools for territorial development and 
the innovation in local policy making;
The richness of considering more interdisciplinary experiences (here between 
design, urban planning and policy making) as a way to question and explore the 
potential developments of design education;
The field work and immersive approaches that question the schools as physical 
places in vitro compared to education in vivo;
• 
• 
DESIGN POLICY
Both experiences of collaborative constructions of future visions for territorial 
development outline the perspective of an open governance calling for new roles 
and attitudes for policy making supported by design approaches:
• 
Giving visibility to local potentials mapping micro informal promising initiatives 
embedded or emerging from the territory;
Ensuring these potentials are developed in tangible visions meaningful for the 
population and that their future implications is expressed in an explicit way for 
all stakeholders; 
• 
•  Making sure that these visions are considered in the stakeholder debate for 
• 
their innovation capabilities within future challenges;
Developing public authorities capability to backup local bottom-up initiatives 
and provide the appropriate environment for self-territorial development.
