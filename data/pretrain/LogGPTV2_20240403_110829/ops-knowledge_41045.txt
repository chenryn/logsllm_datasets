Question: If the UID and GID keys of the Secure Enclave were to be compromised, which of the following scenarios would likely occur? Select all applicable outcomes.
"A": "Files encrypted with the device-specific UID would remain secure, as the UID is designed to be immutable and independent of other device identifiers.",
"B": "The compromised GID could potentially allow attackers to access data common to all devices using the same SoC, as the GID is shared among such devices.",
"C": "Face ID or Touch ID data could be at risk since these use the UID for device-specific secret protection.",
"D": "External storage devices connected over USB to the compromised device would be exposed, as the UID encryption extends to all connected peripherals."
Answer: BC
