they trust,” such as on websites that they already know, or
printed on a business card.
trusting a new URL without verifying it
CM1 alluded to a whitelist of company websites and job
application URLs which they can send to clients, but when
a company or job is not on their list, they either verify it
themselves, or recommend the following strategy for checking:
“I google it, the nearest address of that company. I told him,
this place is 15 minutes drive from here. I give him the
directions — I mean, I printed out the map. Then I told him
you can drive to the address, you can go in, and you can ask
them for their business card. Or you can ask them how to
apply on the website. If you get it from them, it’s trustful. . . ”
However, no participant explained how they learn a new
URL is safe, or what advice they would or do give to their
clients about
in
person or on paper — perhaps because they themselves are not
aware of foolproof strategies to recommend. This is a difﬁcult
problem even for digital natives, who may be more accustomed
to looking for browser-level signs like HTTPS indicators or
searching through search engine results.
Advice about Account Security. Though teachers generally
support their clients’ security and privacy by teaching them
how to protect themselves from scams, they typically do not
include (email) account security or password hygiene. Their
main goals with computer education are for clients to log in to
their email addresses in a browser, send emails, read emails,
attach documents, and log out, but creating the accounts or
picking good usernames and passwords is a one-time process
so it is not a priority (T1).
When case managers and teachers do convey advice about
keeping email accounts secure and private, they advise their
clients to remember their passwords and not to share pass-
words with anyone else (T1, T2, T3, CM5). We note that
this latter piece of advice may be directly counter to the case
managers’ and teachers’ own practices of retaining access to
clients’ passwords — again highlighting the tension between
security “best practices” and the day-to-day requirements of
their work, as well as subtle differences between whom a user
may reasonably need to trust with a password and from whom
passwords should be protected.
Case managers and teachers also impart advice about pass-
word creation, often while helping create or reset a password.
This implicit (or sometimes explicit) advice comes in the
form of the password creation algorithms the case managers
or teachers themselves employ: “I try to help them create
something that’s easy to remember, so I’m like, ‘your birthdate,
your child’s name, or your child’s birthdate’ ” (T1). These
strategies focus more on creating memorable passwords rather
than creating secure passwords, reﬂecting the teachers’ and
case managers’ assessment of their threat model for their
clients’ email accounts:
they often encounter cases where
clients have forgotten their passwords and need help accessing
their accounts, but told no anecdotes about accounts that had
been compromised.
Two teachers also mentioned teaching their clients to log
off of their emails when they are done on the computers, “so
that when someone else gets on the computer, they don’t open
up your email address” (T1).
Summary of security advice. Overall, in Section V-D, we ob-
serve that case managers and teachers seem aware of common
security best practices around account management and avoid-
ing suspicious websites — however, their technical knowledge
may be incomplete, they may struggle with fundamentally
hard usable security challenges (such as identifying phishing
websites), and they may trade off teaching and practicing
hypothetically stronger security measures with the need to
achieve other goals (e.g., helping their clients ﬁnd jobs as
quickly as possible).
VI. DISCUSSION
We now step back to highlight key lessons and develop
recommendations for the computer security community and
other technologists designing for refugees; since refugees have
signiﬁcant overlap with other underserved populations, these
lessons and recommendations may apply more widely to
populations other than refugees.
A. Lessons
In our
Refugees have heterogeneous technical expertise and threat
models, and intersect with other vulnerable populations.
interviews, we encountered and learned about
refugees with highly variable technical skills and experi-
ences. This heterogeneity leads to a diversity of threat mod-
els, security-related actions, and effectiveness of existing or
proposed security solutions. Some refugee subgroups share
concerns and threats with other vulnerable populations in the
US — e.g., people with low incomes,
limited
technical expertise, or limited English skills — while others
may not. The observation that “one size does not ﬁt all” echoes
recent work within the computer security community studying
the needs of particular user groups (e.g., [15]–[18], [22]). For
example, the importance of studying vulnerable populations

like refugees is highlighted by anecdotes from our study about
scams targeted particularly at people looking for low-income
housing or minimum wage jobs; similarly, many of the account
practices of refugees are unique to their situations and relation-
ships with case managers. Computer security researchers may
not be aware of these threats or challenges without speciﬁcally
studying the vulnerable populations that they affect.
Computer security is not a primary concern. Echoing a
common lesson in usable security, we observe that security is
generally not a primary concern for refugees. However, unlike
other user populations, refugees are often trading off security-
related decisions not with convenience or functionality, but
with existential needs that
include ﬁnding a job, making
an income, and establishing a life in the US. Thus, any
computer security solutions or advice that impact the efﬁciency
with which refugees can achieve those primary goals will be
ignored or circumvented.
Common security mechanisms require cultural knowledge.
Many refugees share in common the fact that
their entry
and integration into the United States involves a major cul-
tural shift. In addition to language and other barriers, these
cultural differences can create barriers to establishing their
new lives. We ﬁnd that these cultural barriers also directly
affect computer security. We observe that many common
end user computer security practices rely heavily on US-
based cultural knowledge and norms, including: the fact that
social security numbers must be kept private except under
certain circumstances (e.g., when applying for a job); the
existence of scams and identity theft as a common threat
(and the language skills needed to identify likely scams); the
information requested by account recovery security questions;
and the use of one’s birth date as an authentication token.
It is critical to identify such cultural assumptions embedded
in computer security technologies and account for them in
technology designs.
Common security advice and assumptions may be inap-
plicable to refugees. Among the heterogenous experiences
and needs of refugees, we observed cases in which common
security advice may be inapplicable to them, or even counter-
productive. For example, we found that refugees commonly
share email account access with their case managers, due
to the importance of ﬁnding a job quickly in the face of
limited cultural, linguistic, and technical skills. However, this
practice contradicts common security advice which instructs
people, without regard for their situation, never to share access
to accounts or account credentials. (For example, Apple,
Google, and Microsoft all ofﬁcially advise not sharing account
credentials, even with friends or family members.2) However,
following this advice can be counterproductive — for example,
leading to refugees who are locked out of their email accounts
due to forgotten passwords — and directly conﬂicts with a

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/prevent.aspx
refugee’s primary goal of quickly ﬁnding a job and settling
in the US.
Refugees’ computer security practices are limited by their
sources of advice. We ﬁnd that refugees’ computer security
threat models and practices are heavily inﬂuenced by their
case managers and teachers, who act as key facilitators of their
establishment of a life in the US. Other refugees, friends, and
family also provide security-related advice. As a result, the
security-related beliefs and practices of refugees are composed
of a patchwork of advice and anecdotes shared by people who
themselves are typically not technology or computer security
experts, and are thus limited by the gaps in their threat models
or technical knowledge (echoing ﬁndings about a digital divide
in prior work on security advice more generally [20], [21]). For
example, though case managers and teachers often discussed
attempting to teach their clients to be cautious about which
links to click on and which websites to trust, they often did
not describe concrete strategies for how to make these trust
judgments. It is not reasonable to expect that everyone working
with refugees (or other vulnerable populations) be a computer
security expert — instead, this observation further emphasizes
the need for usable security more generally.
B. Recommendations
Informed by our ﬁndings, we make recommendations for
concrete technical directions that can better serve the security
and privacy needs of recently resettled refugees in the US.
Security for public computer users. Since many refugees do
not have computers at home, we found that they frequently
use public computers for personal activities, including email
and job applications, raising a number of potential security
concerns. Ideally, administrators of public or semi-public
computers should anticipate that some of their users may
leave behind sensitive artifacts (and may rely on accessing
them later), like resumes, or logged-in email accounts, and
implement technical protections to protect the users’ privacy
between sessions. This solution relies on the individual admin-
istrators of these machines, however, and to our knowledge,
research methods for secure, trustworthy kiosks have not been
widely deployed [23]. By contrast, we found that refugees
frequently do have smartphones. One potential opportunity
for future work is to leverage these personal devices to help
provide security for personal accounts and artifacts on public
computers.
Security education and training. Refugees typically learn
computer skills and security from people who are not them-
selves computer security experts, and thus whose advice is
subject to the gaps in their own knowledge and threat models.
While it would be unreasonable to expect refugees or their case
managers and teachers to become computer security experts,
there may be targeted education and training interventions
that could be effective. Future work should consider how to
most effectively train and educate non-experts, such as case
managers and teachers, who educate, in high volume, a less

technically-adept population. For example, we suggest that
security advice take into account the unique needs and tensions
of technology use in this population, such as the reliance on
case managers for handling job-related emails — i.e., rather
than advising people never to share account access, directing
people to more secure alternatives that may better balance their
security and access needs (such as mail delegation in Gmail3).
Password and account management. Our results reveal that
refugees need to share their email accounts with their case
managers, and case managers need to be able to efﬁciently
access many different email accounts — causing them to en-
gage in practices that may violate common security “best
practices,” such as reusing passwords, using weak passwords,
or storing them in plaintext ﬁles. We observe that there already
exist
technologies that case managers and refugees could
use to balance these efﬁciency and security goals, such as
password managers and email account delegation. However,
we also observe that these existing solutions may not serve
this particular use case. Password managers, for instance,
may be difﬁcult to use on a public computer, and not every
password manager allows sharing credentials. Some email
providers, such as Gmail, allow email account delegation3,
but this feature seems designed more for use cases where the
primary account owner has an assistant — it would not allow
the case manager to actually act as the refugee when replying
to emails, and would not give the case manager direct access
to the password, which they sometimes need for account
recovery purposes. Furthermore, we observe that other account
security measures, such as two-factor authentication, may be
entirely impractical for refugees’ use cases, as they would
prevent intended access by case managers. These observations
raise several challenges for future directions: When existing
password and account management solutions are appropriate,
how can knowledge of these solutions be imparted to refugees
and case managers? And when existing solutions are not
appropriate, how should other, more appropriate mechanisms
be designed?
Design to leverage refugees’ trust in case managers and
teachers. We learned that many refugees trust and rely on
their case managers and teachers, who pass on a lot of
technical and cultural knowledge. An area for future research
is how to effectively leverage that trust and use technology
to help case managers and teachers pass on their knowledge
asynchronously and effectively. One example of existing work
along this line is Lantern [12], a smartphone application that
helps newer refugees leverage the expertise of more experi-
enced members of the community by scanning strategically
placed NFC tags in places like resettlement agencies, bus
stops, or grocery stores. Based on our ﬁndings, we observe
other such opportunities — for example, a browser extension or
smartphone application — that could allow refugees to consult
remotely with their case managers about their impression of
the trustworthiness of a particular website, or check a site
3https://support.google.com/mail/answer/138350?hl=en
against a whitelist precompiled by the case manager, a practice
that we observed occurring manually in Section V-C.
Security for digital documents. Another area where tech-
nology may be helpful for refugees is in providing security
for digital documents, such as photos of sensitive documents
that we learned refugees may carry on their (potentially un-
locked) smartphones. There do exist smartphone applications
for storing encrypted or hidden photos (e.g., KeepSafe4), as
well as digital wallet applications (e.g., DigiLocker5). Future
work should study these types of applications in detail to
determine whether they have the security, functionality, and
convenience properties needed for refugees’ use cases — and
if not, develop new applications or other approaches that do.
C. Limitations
Finally, we present several limitations of our study that
should be considered when interpreting our results.
First, although qualitative methods can be insightful probes
into vulnerable or hard-to-access populations, such as ours,
they do not allow for statistically signiﬁcant results. How-
ever, qualitative work on the security needs and concerns
of various populations is valuable, e.g., [15]–[17], and the
depth of the results forms recommendations and lessons for
future researchers. Additionally, there is inherent bias in any
interview study, particularly about security and privacy, from
the fact that participants self-select to participate. For example,
it is possible that highly privacy-conscious individuals may be
