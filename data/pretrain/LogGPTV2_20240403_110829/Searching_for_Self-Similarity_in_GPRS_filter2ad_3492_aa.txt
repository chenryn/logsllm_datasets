Abstract.  Based on measurements in live GPRS networks, the degree of self-
similarity for the aggregated WAP and WEB traffic is investigated by utilizing
six  well  established  Hurst  parameter  estimators.  We  show  that  in  particular
WAP traffic is long-range dependent and its scaling for time scales below the
average page duration is not second order self similar. WAP over UDP can also
determine the overall traffic scaling, if it is the majority traffic. Finally we ob-
serve  that  the  minor  traffic  exhibits  a  larger  Hurst  value  than  the  aggregated
traffic, in case of WAP as well as in case of WEB traffic.
1  Introduction
Based on live GPRS traffic measurements, we investigate the packet arrival process
and  the  data  volume  arrival  process  of  WAP  and  WEB  traffic  on  statistical  self-
similarity.
Many studies have been looking at various network types and found evidence for
self-similarity (e.g., [1],[2],[3]). This property is regarded as an invariant of network
traffic and has serious performance implications. In the case of self-similar traffic the
applied  statistics  for  performance  analysis  and  network  dimensioning  are  different
from  those  when  applied  to  statistically  more  simple  traffic,  which  can  be  modeled
with  Markovian  processes  ([4],[5]).  For  instance  the  queue  tail  behavior  is  heavy-
tailed in the case of self-similar input traffic [6]. This leads to heavy-tailed packet de-
lay distributions,  which can influence the TCP round-trip time  estimations.  Further-
more, the traffic does not smooth out in the case of aggregation, leading to congestion
situations and packet-drops due to the burstiness of the traffic. Consequently, it is im-
portant to understand the self-similar nature of the traffic in a network in order to ap-
ply  the  right  statistical  methods  for  performance  investigations  and  network  dimen-
sioning.  In  previous  studies  the  reason  for  self-similarity  has  been  identified  as  the
heavy-tailedness of many statistical properties of Internet traffic, on the user and ap-
plication level. In [7] and [18] the authors showed that heavy-tailed sessions and file
size  lengths  lead  to  self-similarity  for  large  aggregation  scales  (long-range  depend-
ency).  The  authors  in  [8]  and  [14]  have  furthermore  shown  that  self-similarity  (in
particular the multiscaling) behavior at small timescales (e.g., smaller than the aver-
age round-trip time) is due to protocol interactions of TCP.
But GPRS traffic and in general cellular access network traffic has not yet been in-
vestigated on its self-similarity property. GPRS is not merely a new access technolo-

gy, it also introduces novel applications such as WAP and MMS, and provides Inter-
net  access  in  a  mobile  or  nomadic  usage  environment.  This  yields  a  special  traffic
composition,  different  from  wireline  Internet  traffic.  We  have  investigated  GPRS
networks with more than 60% of the traffic volume consisting of UDP traffic. This is
in sharp contrast to the usual 80% of TCP traffic in the fixed Internet (cf. [9] for ear-
lier figures on GPRS traffic). Additionally, WAP and MMS file sizes are in general
much shorter than WEB and FTP file sizes [17]. For these reasons we counter-check
the property of self-similarity in GPRS. Based on our results, which show that GPRS
and in particular WAP traffic, is asymptotically second order self-similar (long-range
dependent), we propose for further research to study the scaling nature of GPRS traf-
fic and to explore in particular the reasons for this for WAP traffic.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we give a brief over-
view  of  self-similarity  together  with  the  commonly  used  methods  to  test  self-
similarity. Next, we describe our measurement set-up and the investigated traces. In
our main section we present the results of the Hurst parameter estimation methods to
assess the degree of self-similarity in GPRS. Finally, in the concluding section we list
open issues and future work items.

Self-similarity,  in  a  strict  sense,  means  that  the  statistical  properties  (e.g.,  all  mo-
ments) of a stochastic process do not change for all aggregation levels of the stochas-
tic process. That is, the stochastic process “looks the same” if one zooms in time “in

however, as it is often the used case, we will use long-range dependent for asymptoti-
cally second-order self-similar traffic.
Asymptotical second-order self-similar processes have a few interesting character-
istics. For instance, the  autocorrelation  function  of  an  LRD  process  is  decaying  hy-
perbolically. That is (with β the same as in H, above):
Also the variance of the aggregated time series is very slowly decaying. That is:

3  Estimation Methods for Self-similarity
Various  methods  for  estimating  the  Hurst  parameter  H  exist  for  deducing  self-
similarity  or  long-range  dependency  [15].  The  estimation  methods  can  be  grouped
into time-based and frequency-based methods. We will briefly provide an overview of
the methods used to estimate the value of the Hurst parameter.
The first four methods are time-based:
R/S method
This method is based on empirical observations by Hurst and estimates H are based
on  the  R/S  statistic.  It  indicates  (asymptotically)  second-order  self-similarity.  H  is
roughly estimated through the slope of the linear line in a log-log plot, depicting the
R/S statistics over the number of points of the aggregated series.
Variance Method
The Variance Method is based on the slowly decaying variance property as stated
above. It indicates long-range dependency. The slope β of the straight line in a log-log
plot, depicting the sample variance over the block size of each aggregation, is used for
roughly estimating H. H is given by

Absolute Moment Method
This method is related to the variance method computed for the first moment. The
