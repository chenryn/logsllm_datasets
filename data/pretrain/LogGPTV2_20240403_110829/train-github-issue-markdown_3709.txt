I am trying to send a csv file as a base64 encoded string in the body of a
post request to a flask server. It works find for small files. But when I try
to post a file above ~150k the server does not respond and there is no error
message. It seems to get hung up on `body = request.get_json()`. This non-
responsiveness happens through postman and node. To throw a wrench into the
problem, I can submit the file fine using pythons requests library. I am not
sure what is causing this or what the difference between the three requests.
The headers all look really similar and are included in the repo. I have
included the minimal server (server.py), working python request (test.py), the
not working node request (jstest.js) and the not working postman collection.
Thanks for any help.
