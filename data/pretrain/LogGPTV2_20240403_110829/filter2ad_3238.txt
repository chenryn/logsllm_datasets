## Abstract
The lack of adoption of a DNS-based geographic location service, as proposed in RFC 1876, has led to the deployment of alternative methods for locating Internet hosts. These alternatives include active probing of individual hosts and exhaustive tabulation of IP address ranges with their corresponding locations. Using active measurements, we demonstrate that the geographic span of IP address blocks makes it difficult to accurately determine their location. Assigning a single location to an entire block of IP addresses can result in significant localization errors, regardless of the chosen location. Even using the location that minimizes the global localization error for all IP addresses within a block still results in large errors. The concept of the geographic span of an IP address block is ambiguous and heavily dependent on the uncertainty associated with the location estimates of its IP addresses.

## 1. Introduction
Location-aware applications have become increasingly prevalent [1, 2, 3]. One approach to locate Internet hosts is to embed their location information in DNS records, as proposed in RFC 1876 [4]. However, this approach has seen limited adoption due to the required changes in DNS records. Other geolocation services rely on exhaustive tabulation between IP ranges and their corresponding locations, such as GeoURL [1], the Net World Map project [2], and several commercial tools. Managing and updating these tabulations is challenging, and the accuracy of the locations is often uncertain.

Padmanabhan et al. [5] developed three techniques to map IP addresses to geographic locations and investigated the challenges in geolocating Internet hosts. One technique involves iteratively clustering IP addresses to a single location. The authors observed that the accuracy of this method is related to the geographic spread of hosts within these IP blocks.

In this paper, we quantify the extent to which assigning a single location to all IP addresses within a block leads to inaccurate geolocation. We compare the locations of IP address blocks from two datasets [6, 7] with location estimates based on active measurements. Our findings show that the geographic span of IP address blocks, combined with the inherent uncertainty of individual IP address locations, makes it difficult to choose a representative location for the block. Even the optimal location (which minimizes the global localization error) for a block of IP addresses results in significant differences between the estimated location of individual IP addresses and the attributed location of the entire block. Throughout this paper, we refer to "block of IP addresses" as "block" and "IP addresses" as "IPs."

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the datasets used for inferring the location of target hosts based on active measurements. In Section 3, we investigate the inherent imprecision of estimating the location of individual IPs using a single location for their block. Finally, we conclude in Section 4.

## 2. Datasets
We use two datasets containing IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses with corresponding location entries. The first dataset includes 292,362 potential IPs of Web clients that exchanged content over CoralCDN [6], and the second dataset is the GeoIP database [3]. For each IP address in the CoralCDN dataset, we retrieve its geographic location from the GeoIP database, which also provides the block of IP addresses to which the IP belongs. We cross-check the location estimates from the two databases and find that 80,449 hosts provide different location estimates, while 211,913 hosts have the same location estimate (at the city level).

For the IPs with consistent location estimates, we apply the CBG technique [8] to determine their geographic location. We conducted measurements using 74 PlanetLab nodes distributed globally over three weeks from March 31 to April 19, 2006. We successfully located 25,775 IPs out of the 211,913 whose city-level locations agreed between the two databases. Of these, 7,016 IPs were not located by CBG, possibly due to being private, behind firewalls, or unresponsive to ping probes. Thus, our study uses the remaining 18,759 successfully located IPs, which correspond to 876 blocks. The number of IP addresses probed within these 876 blocks varies between 3 and 197.

## 3. Limitations of Block-Level Geolocation

### 3.1 Geographic Span of IP Address Blocks
Estimating the actual geographic area spanned by a block of IPs is challenging. Both active measurements and exhaustive tabulation contain some uncertainty. For active measurements like CBG, the geolocation is given as a confidence region (CR) [8]. Since all IPs in a block are attributed to a single city-level location in the two databases, it is impossible to estimate the span of blocks based on this information. Therefore, we rely on the estimates provided by CBG for each IP address, using the centroid of the CR as the location of the IP address.

For each block \( p \), we compute the maximum distance \( d_{\text{max}}(p) \) between any two of its IPs for which CBG provided a location. We call \( d_{\text{max}}(p) \) the maximal span of block \( p \). Since \( d_{\text{max}}(p) \) might be much larger than the typical distance between any two IP addresses within \( p \), we also compute the median distance between any pair of IP addresses within \( p \), which we call the median span of block \( p \).

Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of both the maximal and median spans over the 876 blocks of IPs. More than 10% of the blocks have a maximal span of 0, meaning all their IPs have the same location. More than 40% of the blocks have a median span of 0 km, indicating that half of the IPs in these blocks are located at the same spot. A very small span for a block requires that the uncertainty of the geolocation of its IPs be very small, which typically occurs when the localized host is close to one or several landmarks. About 50% of the blocks have a maximal span larger than 500 km, while only 5% of the blocks have a median span larger than 500 km.

### 3.2 Optimal Location of Blocks of IP Addresses
To determine the best possible location for a block that is as close as possible to the locations of all IPs within the block, we compute the optimal location for each block, i.e., the location that minimizes the sum of the distances between the location of the block and the centroid of the CR of each of its IPs. If we assign the optimal location to each block, we would obtain approximation errors as shown in Figure 2.

Even with the optimal location, only slightly more than 40% of the IPs would be located within 200 km of their estimated location based on active measurements. More than 10% of the IPs would still be mislocalized by more than 500 km. Although this is better than the localization provided by the database, it is still far from satisfactory compared to the precision achievable with active measurements.

## 4. Conclusion
We have investigated the imprecision of relying on the location of blocks of IP addresses to locate Internet hosts. Our results show that the geographic area spanned by blocks can be large, often much larger than the typical distance between any two IPs within a block. Even using the optimal location for a block leads to significant geolocation errors. This work highlights the need to assess the quality of geolocation information derived from exhaustive tabulation, as it inherently contains substantial imprecision.
