User: How to use GitLab CI/CD for automated build, test and deployment?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use GitLab CI/CD for automated build, test, and deployment: 1. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root directory of the code base, which defines the tasks to be executed when running the CI/CD process. 2. Set up and configure GitLab Runner, which is the agent for executing the CI/CD process. For detailed setup steps, please refer to the official GitLab documentation. 3. Runner will automatically trigger the CI/CD process every time the code is submitted. 4. Edit the .gitlab-ci.yml file to define the execution steps of each job, you can use Shell scripts or Docker containers, etc. 5. Define build, test, and deployment tasks. Multiple tasks can be executed in sequence, such as unit testing and automated testing after the build task is completed, and finally upload HTML and CSS files to the web server through the deployment task. 6. Define process variables and user options in the GitLab CI/CD process, which can be configured with constants and user choices, such as setting task names and selecting deployment servers. 7. To manage and execute the CI/CD process, you can view the logs and output of each task for troubleshooting and optimization.
