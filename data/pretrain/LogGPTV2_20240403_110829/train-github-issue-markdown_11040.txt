Hello,
I am using the preferred_choices option for the first time and i am seeing
that preferred choices are not duplicated in the main list.
I think it can cause trouble with users witch not pay attention that there are
a preferred list or when default value witch is not in the preferred list is
already selected (User will search alphabetically and maybe will not look to
the top of the list).
Is there a way to repeat preferred values in main list ?  
Maybe it should be the default symfony behavior ?
