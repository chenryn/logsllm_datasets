Subject: Preferred Choices Not Duplicated in Main List - Potential User Experience Issues

Hello,

I am currently using the `preferred_choices` option for the first time and have noticed that the preferred choices are not duplicated in the main list. This could potentially cause confusion for users who may not be aware of the existence of a preferred list, or when a default value that is not in the preferred list is already selected. In such cases, users might search alphabetically and overlook the preferred options at the top of the list.

Is there a way to repeat the preferred values in the main list? 

Additionally, I believe this should be the default behavior in Symfony to ensure a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
