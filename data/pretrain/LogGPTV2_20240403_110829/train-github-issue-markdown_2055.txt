Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-iterate-with-javascript-
while-loops has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include
links to screenshots if possible.
This isn't a bug but a problem with the wording in the instructions. The
exercise is for a while loop, but at the bottom of the instructions it says
"Let's try getting a FOR loop to work..."
Nothing major but I figure you would like to correct it for clarity.
Thanks!
