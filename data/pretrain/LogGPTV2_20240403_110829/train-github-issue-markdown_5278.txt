**Matt Young** opened **SPR-6859** and provided the following details:

I initially posted this issue on the forum but received no response. I am hoping that you could look into it.

While developing a scheduled task, I set up a method to run every 60 seconds for testing purposes. However, I noticed in the logs that the method is being executed twice. To rule out a logging issue, I added a static integer counter to the class, which increments with each call. The counter confirms that the method is indeed being executed twice.

I suspect that this might be due to a double context:component-scan, leading to duplicate execution, but I have not been able to pinpoint the exact cause. Any guidance or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

### Code
```java
/**
 * Date: Feb 15, 2010
 * Time: 10:54:36 AM
 */
@Component
public class DataHarvestingServiceImpl implements DataHarvestingService {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(DataHarvestingServiceImpl.class);
    private static int count = 0;

    @Override
    // Every night at 1 AM
    // @Scheduled(cron = "* * 1 * * ?")
    @Scheduled(cron = "0 * * * * ?")
    public void collectSocialMediaData() {
        logger.info("Starting data retrieval at " + new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
        logger.info("Finished media data retrieval at " + new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
        System.out.println("count is " + count++);
    }
}
```
