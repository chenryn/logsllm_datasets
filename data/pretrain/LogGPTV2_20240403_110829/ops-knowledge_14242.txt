User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Active Directory Naming I have a test active directory domain named ad.example.com and have joined some Windows clients stations to the AD domain.

I'm able to log on the client station as AD\username. However, when I try to access protected IIS resource on the the DC (dchostname.ad.example.com) I have to use EXAMPLE\username because AD\username does not work.

Why is this the case? I want to be able to logon to the IIS resource as the logged on user AD\username. Am I missing any setting in IIS to be able to use AD\username to access it? 

[Additional Information]
The server is Windows Server 2008 R2 with IIS 7. The client is Windows 7. Netbios name is dchostname. The protected resouce being accessed is ADFS trust points hosted under IIS Default Web Site to test single signon. As you can tell this is a test setup so I'm not too concerned about sharing on the DC.

In my other setup where the domain name is simply example.com everything works as expected. I'm trying to understand what is different about naming a domain ad.example.com and why that behaves differently. In this case is the domain AD being considered a subdomain? This is the only domain in the forest.

Assistant: Check permissions: who's allowed to use these shares.
Also, sharing something on DC is the bad idea.
