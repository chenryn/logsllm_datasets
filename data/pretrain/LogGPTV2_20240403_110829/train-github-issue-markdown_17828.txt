## ‚ùì Questions & Help

I have a question about RoBERTa. 

I understand that BERT uses the embedding of the `[CLS]` token for prediction. However, I am unclear about which token's embedding is used for prediction in RoBERTa. Could you please clarify which token's embedding is utilized for this purpose in the project? 

Thank you.
