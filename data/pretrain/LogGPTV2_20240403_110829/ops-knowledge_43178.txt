User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Docker: cannot create directory ‘/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs’: Permission denied I am trying to configure a docker image to run with a mounted volume, for persistence. The image is the official artifactory one. It seems odd to me that it will stop after creating several directories with a "Permission denied".

As I inspect the mounted volume, I can see that several folders were created when the image attempted to go up. And the database config is also ok.

Digging a bit, this guy seems to have permission issues artifactory:artifactory

However, I cannot go any further to the point I am able to explain or correct the problem.

Assistant: I had the same issue when sharing an nfs mount point as a volume. This resolved it:

docker-compose up --force-recreate


Hope that fixes your issue!
