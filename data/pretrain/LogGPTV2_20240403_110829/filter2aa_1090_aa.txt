## TEMPEST: Transmitted Electro-Magnetic Pulse/Energy Standards & Testing

- **Definition:** TEMPEST refers to the study and mitigation of compromising emanations from electronic devices.
- **Historical Context:** Coined in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the NSA to secure electronic communications from eavesdropping.
- **Relevance:** Investigates unintentional intelligence-bearing signals that, if intercepted, may disclose sensitive information.

## First Attack: Theory

### PS/2 Cable Wiring

- **Pin 1:** Data
- **Pin 3:** Ground
- **Pin 4:** +5V DC
- **Pin 5:** Clock
- **Pin 2/6:** Unused

### Signal Leakage

- **Poor Shielding:** The wires are close together and poorly shielded.
- **Leakage:** Information from the data wire leaks to the ground wire and/or cable shielding.
- **Ground Routing:** The ground wire is connected to the main power adapter, which is then linked to the power grid.

### Detection

- **Electric Grid:** Keystroke information can be detected on the power plug, including nearby ones sharing the same electric line.
- **Frequency Isolation:** The PS/2 clock frequency (10-16.7 kHz) is lower than other PC components, making it easier to isolate.
- **Filtering:** Use a Band Pass filter to isolate the signal from noise.

### Experimental Setup

- **Oscilloscope as ADC:** Used for initial testing.
- **Reference Ground:** A clean ground free of electrical system noise was used for better measurements.
- **Testing Environment:** Conducted in a nuclear physics laboratory with complex electric grid topology and noisy equipment.

### Results

- **Signal Identification:** Successfully identified keystrokes by filtering out the noise.
- **Examples:**
  - **Letter 'a':** | 0 | 00111000 | 0 | 1 |
  - **Letter 'b':** | 0 | 01001100 | 0 | 1 |

### Attenuation Estimation

- **Copper Cable:** Typical copper cables have an attenuation coefficient of 0.1 dB after 60 meters.
- **Test Observations:** No significant differences in signal strength between 1.5 meters and 15 meters.
- **Signal Power:** Output power is approximately ~1 pW (10^-9 Watt).

### Continuous Sniffing

- **Setup Diagram:**
  - **Keyboard and PC:** Connected via PS/2 cable.
  - **ADC (12-bit):** Sampling rate of 1 Msps / 100 Ksps.
  - **Reference Ground:** Clean ground for improved measurement.
  - **Resistor:** ~150 Ohm for measuring current.

**Conclusion:**
This research demonstrates the feasibility of side-channel attacks using power line leakage and optical sampling. Future work will focus on refining the techniques and equipment used.
