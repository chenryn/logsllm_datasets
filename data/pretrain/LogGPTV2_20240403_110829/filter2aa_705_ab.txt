### The Evolution of Gaming Peripherals

#### 1984-1989
- **Power Glove (Mattel, 1989)**: The Power Glove, released by Mattel in the US, was the first peripheral to "recreate human hand movements on a television or computer screen" [1].

#### 1989-1994
- **SEGA Genesis / MegaDrive (1989)**: SEGA launched the SEGA Genesis/MegaDrive, refining Nintendo's “D-Pad” concept and adding three digital buttons for gameplay, along with a fourth “start” button. The next-generation controller featured a unique “six-button” layout.
- **Variety of Peripherals**: A wide variety of peripherals were released for the Genesis/MegaDrive. For more information, see:

#### 1990
- **Super NES (Nintendo, 1990)**: Nintendo launched the Super NES, which introduced the first controller to use shoulder buttons. It also introduced a balanced “diamond” button configuration, which is still in use today.

#### 1994
- **Sega Saturn (SEGA, 1994)**: SEGA launched the Sega Saturn, featuring a modified Sega Genesis six-button controller and the Saturn 3D controller, which included an analog stick. This was the first controller on the market post-Jaguar to feature analog controls.
- **Sony PlayStation (Sony, 1994)**: Sony launched the PlayStation, initially with the original PlayStation controller, which reused the “diamond” formation of the SNES and added two more shoulder pads. The Dual Shock controller, which followed, introduced two analog sticks and rumble functionality. Sony was also the first to include a memory card for save game storage.

#### 1996
- **Nintendo 64 (Nintendo, 1996)**: Nintendo launched the Nintendo 64 with a redesigned three-pronged controller for better ergonomics. The console also featured a prominent rumble feature and a lock-on technology, mainly used in Pokémon games. It was the first to use a microphone in console games.

#### 2006
- **PlayStation 3 (Sony, 2006)**: Sony launched the PlayStation 3 with a simple redesign of the Dual Shock 2 controller. The vibration feature was removed due to patent violations. The SIXAXIS controller included sensors for yaw, pitch, roll, and translational movement.
- **Wii (Nintendo, 2006)**: Nintendo launched the Wii, revolutionizing controller design with translational, rotational, and positional sensors, providing a completely new gaming experience. The controller expansion port allowed for limitless peripheral development.

#### 2007
- **Project Epoc (Emotiv Systems, 2007)**: Emotiv Systems announced their mind control headset peripheral, Project Epoc. This game controller uses EEG (electroencephalography) as input stimuli, expanding the way we think about gaming and its impact on the human brain.

### Current Trends and Future Directions

#### Innovation Resurgence
- **Social Gaming**: The Wii redefined the social gaming dynamic, making it possible for parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles to play games with their kids.
- **Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs)**: MMOs like Second Life and World of Warcraft have changed the face of the economy and the business world. Some people even live off these games.
- **Xbox Live**: Xbox Live has enabled quick downloads of games, bringing back the shareware/demo era of gaming. Titles like Spore have also contributed to this trend.

#### Health and Cognitive Benefits
- **Cognitive Improvement**: Games like Brain Age have shown that games can help improve cognitive functions.
- **Customizable Platforms**: Sony's LittleBigPlanet is set to revolutionize the way we think about game content.
- **Physical Activity**: The Wii Diet and Dance Dance Revolution have been shown to help people lose weight and stay active, potentially addressing the obesity epidemic.

#### Negative Impacts
- **Addiction**: Games like World of Warcraft have led to addiction, with some players neglecting basic needs and leading to personal and social issues.
- **Personal Stagnation**: There is a need for a healthy balance between gaming and other activities to promote both physical and mental well-being.

#### Biofeedback and Game Design
- **Biofeedback in Games**: Using biofeedback to provide important information about vitals such as heart rate, galvanic skin response, and EEG can help manage conditions like ADD and stress disorders.
- **Pavlovian Training**: Games can be designed to train users to control their bodies and brains, enhancing both entertainment and life improvement.

### Our Contribution: BioBlox
- **BioBlox**: We developed a biofeedback version of a falling block game. One version measures physical stress through heart rate, and the other measures emotional state through galvanic skin response. Both versions adjust difficulty based on the player's physiological responses.
- **Source Code**: Updated source code is available at [http://www.frozennorth.net/DefCon15/BioBlox.zip](http://www.frozennorth.net/DefCon15/BioBlox.zip). Coded in C# for rapid prototyping and quick interface to USB peripherals using “unsafe-mode” memory access and the HID stack.
