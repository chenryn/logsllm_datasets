Body”
What Can Games Do For Us?
 With the right video game you can:
 Boost visual skills
 Lose weight
 Control ADD
 Boost language skills
 Ease pain
 Improve skills in literacy and numeracy
 Develop skills in visualization, experimentation, 
creativity, manual dexterity, strategic and tactical 
decision‐making
 Help the brain age slower
 Sharpen vision
 Control stress and tension
How Do We Achieve Such  
Wonders?
 Body and brain stimulus!
 Using biofeedback to provide important information 
about your vitals
 Heart‐rate to monitor physical stress and tension
 Galvanic skin response to cover psychological stress and 
emotion
 Electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brain waves
 Accelerometer to measure bodily motion
 Thermometer to measure body temperature
 Etc.
What Do We Propose?
 Use biofeedback response to learn to control your 
body and brain
 ADD can be managed by training the brain to focus
 Similarly, stress disorders can be managed by forcing the 
user to calm down before the game will continue, or get 
harder under duress
 Pavlovian training methodologies for bodily control
 More globally, make use of video games to not only 
entertain but to enhance your life
 Plus, it’ll make for some kick‐ass online play...
What Have We Done?
 BioBlox!
 A biofeedback version of everyone’s favourite falling 
block game
 Two versions: one measures physical stress by 
monitoring player’s heart rate
 Game gets harder the greater the heart‐rate
 Another measures emotional state through galvanic skin 
response
 Just like Scientologists but without the creepy
 Game gets harder as players approach an intense emotional 
state
What Have We Done?
