Abstract. In cellular networks, handover plays a vital role in supporting
mobility and connectivity. Traditionally, handovers in a cellular network
focus on maintaining continuous connectivity for legacy voice calls. How-
ever, there is a poor understanding of how today’s handover strategies
impact the network performance, especially for applications that require
reliable Internet connectivity.
In this work, using a newly designed context-triggered measurement
framework, we carry out the ﬁrst comprehensive measurement study in
LTE networks on how handover decisions implemented by carriers impact
network layer performance. We ﬁnd that the interruption in connectivity
during handover is minimal, but in 43% of cases the end-to-end through-
put degrades after the handover. The cause is that the deployed handover
policy uses statically conﬁgured signal strength threshold as the key fac-
tor to decide handover and focuses on improving signal strength which by
itself is an imperfect metric for performance. We propose that handover
decision strategies trigger handover based on predicted performance con-
sidering factors such as cell load along with application preference.
1 Introduction
Mobile devices rely on cellular networks to get network access to support data
services. Since the coverage of each cell1 is limited, handover between cells is
essential for ensuring continuous connectivity and mobility. In addition, when
the device is in the coverage of multiple cells, a proper policy should handover
the mobile device to a cell that provides good performance.
There has been little work to understand how the deployed cellular network
handover policies aﬀects network layer performance in the wild. Speciﬁcally,
questions such as what is the interruption in the network during handover and
whether network performance consistently improves after handover are not well
understood. In this paper, we perform the ﬁrst large-scale study of handovers in
LTE network using crowd-sourced measurements of over 200 users across three
major carriers for the purpose of evaluating the performance implications of

existing handover algorithms and policies. Performing measurements to capture
transient handover events eﬃciently is challenging. To address such challenges,
we develop a novel context-triggered measurement framework that dynamically
initiates performance measurements of interest only when handover is likely to
occur to reduce the measurement overhead.
Based on our measurement results, we identiﬁed fundamental limitations in
the current design and deployment of handover algorithms: the use of static
conﬁgurations on signal strength diﬀerence with neighboring cells and a lack
of awareness of network performance. As a consequence, in 43% of cases the
throughput degrades after the handover. By analyzing physical layer information
in LTE network, we found that the cause of the performance degradation is that
target cells have higher load and allocate less physical resources.
Our ﬁndings help motivate the need for handover algorithms based on net-
work performance considering both signal strength and cell load. The measure-
ment also shows the opportunity to improve the handover decision (Sect. 4):
(a) currently handovers do not occur only when devices experience poor sig-
nal strength, indicating that the time of handover could be potentially changed
without risk of link failures; (b) the dense deployment of cells provides more
than one candidate target cell the device could be potentially handed over to in
many cases.
We summarize the main contribution of our work below.
– We designed a context-triggered measurement
framework to support
lightweight and accurate handover measurements. Using this setup, we col-
lected 5 months’ data from 200 users across three major cellular carriers in
the U.S. to investigate performance impact of handover in LTE network.
– Using cross-layer analysis to incorporate radio link layer visibility with our
data collector, we found that the current deployed handover policy relies on
statically conﬁgured thresholds on signal strength. It focuses on improving
signal strength and leads to potential performance degradation after the han-
dover.
– We found that the interruption caused by intra-LTE handover is usually min-
imal. However, the median performance improvement after the handover is
close to 0 in metrics including latency, throughput and jitter. The current
handover algorithms do not appear to optimize performance.
– We identiﬁed that the performance degradation after handover is caused by
higher load in the target cell and less allocated physical resources to the
devices. We proposed cells predict performance after handover based on signal
strength and cell load information and make handover decisions based on
performance.

2.1 LTE Handover and Data Transmission Procedure
Handovers within LTE networks are initiated by the cells and they can maintain
ongoing network connections. We ﬁrst deﬁne some basic terminology. Serving cell
is the cell a user equipment (UE) is currently connected to. Target cell becomes
the serving cell after the handover. We also refer to the original serving cell after
the handover completes as the source cell.
As Fig. 1 shows, to help decide when to trigger handover, the mobile device
measures radio signal strength of both the serving cell and neighbor cells peri-
odically. A commonly used metric of signal strength is Reference Signal Received
Power (RSRP), i.e., the average power received from the reference signals of the
cell. The serving cell sends the measurement conﬁguration to the device to spec-
ify when measurement results should be reported back. Depending on the mea-
surement conﬁgurations, the measurement reports can be either event-triggered
or periodical. Event-triggered reports are sent only when the link quality sat-
isﬁes certain conditions. From previous work, a common trigger for intra-LTE
handover is event A3 [8,11], where the signal strength of neighbor cell becomes
better than the serving cell by a relative threshold value. Based on factors includ-
ing measurement reports and load information, the serving cell makes decisions
6
S. Xu et al.
on handover [13]. The actual handover decision algorithm depends on the imple-
mentation at eNodeB or LTE base-station. After the source cell determines to
perform a handover for a UE, it conducts a negotiation with the target cell to
ensure enough resource at the target cell. Then it sends a message to the UE
to initiate the handover. The UE disconnects with the source cell and connects
to the target cell. After it successfully connects to the target cell, it notiﬁes the
target cell of the completion of the handover. These signaling messages between
the cell and the UE are exchanged using radio resource control (RRC) protocol.
To understand how the network layer performance is determined by the lower
layer in LTE network, we also brieﬂy describe the data transmission procedure in
the physical layer. Wireless communication requires radio spectrum resources.
In LTE, cells dynamically allocate the physical radio resources in the unit of
physical resource blocks (PRBs) to UEs and transmit data to the UEs using
the allocated PRBs. The allocation strategy is not standardized in the speciﬁca-
tion and depends on vendor-speciﬁc implementation. However, typically cells use
proportional scheduling algorithm [7], which optimizes cell eﬃciency while main-
taining fairness across all UEs in the long term. When the cell load increases,
i.e. more UEs connect to the cell and the total traﬃc volume increases, the
allocated PRBs for each UE reduce. We denote the ratio between the allocated
PRBs to a UE and the total PRBs of a cell as PRB ratio. The number of bytes
transmitted by each PRB is determined by the signal strength, i.e., with strong
signal strength and good channel quality, the cell could use coding schemes with
high eﬃciency and thus transmits more data on each PRB. In summary, the
performance in LTE network is aﬀected by both the cell load which determines
the PRB allocation and the signal strength which determines the transmission
eﬃciency.
2.2 Related Work
The problem of handover in cellular networks has attracted signiﬁcant attention
in both academia and industry. However, there is little work on understanding
the performance impact of handover decisions in operational LTE network.
Previous work measured intra-LTE handovers using simulation [8,9] and
testbeds [13,22] to understand the performance of applications during handover.
Our work diﬀers in that we measured the handover performance in the wild.
Recent work [14,16,19,23] study persistent handover loops caused by miscon-
ﬁgurations. We also identify such misconﬁgurations for a few cells in the wild
but ﬁnd they are not dominant. Our focus is to characterize the interruption
caused by handover regardless of handover loops and compare the network per-
formance before and after handover to understand the performance implica-
tions of deployed handover policies. Some other work [4,12,20,21] studied han-
dovers between diﬀerent technologies, e.g. 3G and 4G. Our work studies handover
between diﬀerent cells in LTE network.

3 Methodology
To understand the impact of handover on performance in the wild, we crowd-
source our measurement using a context-triggered measurement framework.
3.1 On-Device Measurement Support
We combine passive monitoring with active measurements to study handover
with minimal measurement overhead.
Passive Monitoring. We keep track of device context including network type,
signal strength and location. Through a novel use of the built-in diagnostic inter-
face from Qualcomm communication chips, we also collect (1) lower layer RRC
layer information including measurement conﬁgurations and handover messages
and (2) physical layer information including PRB allocations. Our lower-layer
message collection builds upon SnoopSnitch [2] which is an open-source Android
app aimed to detect attacks such as fake base station using data from the Diag-
nostic Interface. The collector requires root privilege and reads the raw radio
messages from the character device /dev/diag when DIAG CHAR option is acti-
vated in Android kernel. The collector also collects ﬁne-grained signal strength
information from the diagnostic interface every 40 ms, while the signal strength
information from Android API updates only every two to three seconds. We are
one of the ﬁrst to crowd-source LTE radio-link layer messages.
Active Measurement. To understand how handover impacts network per-
formance, we use the Mobilyzer measurement library [18], a principled mobile
network measurement platform, to measure network performance. We issue ping,
TCP throughput, and UDP burst measurements to capture network character-
istics using metrics including latency, throughput, jitter, packet loss.
Compared with passive monitoring, active measurements consume data
resources and can cause signiﬁcant impact on battery life. As data and battery
resources are scarce on mobile devices, we need to capture performance during
handover events eﬃciently. Towards this goal, we develop a context-triggered
framework to trigger measurements only when a handover is predicted to occur
in the near future.
Context-Triggered Measurement Framework. In general, deciding when
to issue measurements is a challenging task. If we simply perform measurements
periodically, the interval is diﬃcult to conﬁgure. A small interval leads to large
amount of unnecessary measurements that fail to capture interesting phenomena,
wasting valuable data and battery resources on the device; while a large interval
can miss the phenomena we are interested in.
One approach to solving this problem is to trigger measurements [3] based
on context that speciﬁes the conditions of interest. We estimate the likelihood of
8
S. Xu et al.
observing relevant events based on the device context and trigger measurements
only when the probability of capturing desired events is high. This helps reduce
unnecessary measurements while capturing more events of interest.
We design a context-triggered measurement framework atop Mobilyzer [18].
We send the devices measurement tasks with speciﬁc context requirements. The
devices keep monitoring related context and trigger measurements once the con-
text conditions are met. Note that diﬀerent contexts contain diﬀerent informa-
tion with diﬀerent cost. Even querying the same context with diﬀerent granu-
larity requirement has diﬀerent cost implications. These considerations motivate
our design of supporting a multi-level triggering procedure. At the ﬁrst level, we
monitor a context with the lowest cost. If the context indicates that the possibil-
ity of desired event occurrence is high, we monitor another context with higher
cost or the same context with higher accuracy. This can be done with multiple
layers until we reach high conﬁdence that the event will occur. There is certainly
a trade-oﬀ from using many levels to reduce measurement overhead but at the
cost of introducing delay in capturing the event of interest which could lead to
fewer events captured. We argue that the number of levels need to be adjusted
depending on the type of events and the overhead of triggering at each level.
We apply this framework to understand the performance impact of han-
dovers. Based on the passively collected lower layer messages, we ﬁnd that LTE
handovers usually happen when a cell with a stronger signal strength than the
connected cell is discovered for a mobile user (Sect. 4). We implement the frame-
work as follows. We ﬁrst use sensors to detect user movement, as the power con-
sumption of movement detection sensors such as accelerometers is only 5 mW
for an active device. Once we detect that the user is moving, we start to read
ﬁne-grained signal strength data from the diagnostic interface, which consumes
around 200 mW. If the neighbor cell signal strength is stronger than the serving
cell, a ping, throughput or udp burst measurement is triggered, consuming more
than 1500 mW to activate the radio [10].
To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the framework, we run simulation on all traces
collected from PhoneLab deployment [5] as explained later. Figure 2 compares
the overhead and accuracy of measurements with and without context triggered
framework. T = x means the measurement are triggered when the signal strength
of neighbor cell is stronger than the serving cell by the threshold of x dBm. P = y
denotes periodic measurement every y minutes. We calculate the overhead as the
average number of measurements for identiﬁed handovers, and accuracy as the
percentage of measurements that capture handovers. As shown, our framework
can reduce the overhead to 1% while increasing the accuracy by 10 times. In
the actual deployment, labeled as “Real” in Fig. 2, we use T = 0. Compared
to the simulation results, the real deployment has a slightly lower overhead
and accuracy, because we imposed constraints on the resource usage of active
measurements to reduce impact on user experiences.
