### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
Override replaces some but not all instances of overriden dependency. In this
example, I have a dependency on a package which has a dependency on `npm`
which contains a vulnerable version of `ansi-regex`. I tried to fix this via
an override but `npm audit` still complains and searching through package-
lock.json shows various version numbers before my overriden value.
### Expected Behavior
According to docs, `overrides` should ensure all installed instances of a
dependency conform to the given value so I expect my override version 5.0.1
only to exist.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. Clone https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun
  2. Modify package.json with:
    "overrides": {
        "ansi-regex": "5.0.1",
      },
  3. Delete package-lock.json and run `npm install`
  4. Run `npm audit` and see that vulnerable older versions of `ansi-regex` still exist..
### Environment
