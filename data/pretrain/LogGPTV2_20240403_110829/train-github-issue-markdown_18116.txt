Im populating several Text Fields from localstorage using initialValue. As
default im only able to see first row, but it will expand as soon as im start
typing.
Is there any way i can enable full height as default?

I have tried the following properties.
            multiLine={true}
            fullWidth={true} 
            rowsMax={10}
            rows={5}
