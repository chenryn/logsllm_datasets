HOW TO DOWNLOAD FLASH VIDEOS, ICONS, AND OTHER IMAGES USING FIREFOX
Some websites—like www.DarknessGate.com—protect multimedia content by disabling 
selection and right-click. Many websites are still using Flash videos (SWF files) to display 
animation. to download SWF files and other multimedia files—when the right-click on a site is 
disabled—using only Firefox browser, follow these steps:
 a. go to the Firefox menu and select tools and then page info.
 B. go to the Media tab and locate your SWF file or the images you want to 
download. Select the file and then click the Save as button (see Figure 4-28).

 Reverse Image Search
A reverse image search uses a sample image instead of a search query. It works by 
uploading an image—or inserting its URL—into a reverse image search engine, which 
will in turn search its index to find where else this image appears online and display 
all the other locations. In this way, you can know the original source of photographs, 
memes, and profile pictures. The following are the most popular reverse image search 
engine sites:
• 
Google reverse search (https://www.google.com/imghp): Google has 
a dedicated search engine for image reverse searches; you can either 
paste the image URL in the search box or upload it to Google (see 
Figure 4-29).
• 
Karmadecay (http://karmadecay.com): This is a reverse image 
search on Reddit.com (in beta).
• 
TinyEye (www.tineye.com): You can search by image or URL; more 
than 24 billion images have already been indexed.
• 
Reverse Image Search (www.reverse-image-search.com): Conduct a 
reverse image search with Google, Bing, and Yandex.
• 
Imagebrief (www.imagebrief.com): Search for images and use reverse 
image searches as well.

• 
Cam Finds App (http://camfindapp.com): This is an app available 
for both Android and Apple devices. It uses visual search technology 
to recognize uploaded pictures and gives instant results about them 
such as related images, local shopping results, and a vast selection of 
web results.
• 
Image Identification Project (https://www.imageidentify.com): This 
uses visual search technology to recognize uploaded images.
 Image Manipulation Check
OSINT multimedia searches intersect many areas of the digital forensics field. As an 
online investigator, you should not trust all the multimedia files you acquire. If you are in 
doubt about any multimedia file (image or video), you should check carefully to assure 
that it has not been tampered with, meaning manipulated on purpose to hide or alter 
some facts. Image analysis begins with identifying the source device (camera or mobile 
phone) used to take the photo. This information is part of image metadata.
As we already mentioned in Chapter 2, all digital file types can include metadata 
(which is a data about data). Metadata can include a wealth of useful information 
for your investigation. In Chapter 2 we mentioned some tools to view/edit metadata 
in images, video, PDFs, and Microsoft Office documents. We will continue here and 
mention additional tools that are specifically useful for digital images:
• 
Forensically (https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic- 
magnifier): This site offers free tools for image forensics analysis; it 
includes clone detection, error-level analysis, metadata extraction, 
and more.
• 
Fotoforensics (http://fotoforensics.com): This offers the forensics 
analysis of JPEG and PNG files to check for any manipulation using 
error-level analysis (ELA) techniques.
• 
Ghiro (www.getghiro.org): This is an open source tool that can 
analyze images in bulk and extract metadata information, use GPS 
metadata to search for nearby images, and perform ELA to detect 
whether an image has been manipulated. You can download this 
program as a virtual appliance that is ready to use (it comes installed 
within Linux Ubuntu).

• 
ExifTool (https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool): You can 
read, write, and edit meta-information in a wide variety of files. It 
supports different metadata formats such as EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, 
JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, AFCP, and ID3.
• 
Exif Search (https://www.exif-search.com): This is a commercial 
search of images by using their metadata.
•

This analyzes the source of the image to test its authenticity.
• 
GeoSetter (www.geosetter.de/en): You can manipulate/view 
geodata—and other metadata information—of other images.
• 
Lets Enhance (https://letsenhance.io): You can enhance a photo 
size without losing its quality. The free account allows for 14 images. 
However, you still need to upload a target image to the server, and 
this will impose privacy concerns on the uploaded files.
 OCR Tools
During your search, you may encounter text written inside images. This text should be 
extracted first so that it can be edited, formatted, indexed, searched, or translated. The 
following are popular tools and web services for extracting text from images, known as 
optical character recognition (OCR):
• 
FreeOCR (www.paperfile.net/index.html)
• 
Free Online OCR (www.i2ocr.com)
• 
NewOCR (www.newocr.com)

You will notice that Google has presented your uploaded image on the top of the 
document and created an editable OCR text below it (see Figure 4-31).
 Video
The technological revolution has affected the way people communicate. For instance, 
Internet speed is increasing steadily and has become more affordable in most countries 
around the world. Computing devices such as tables and smartphones are getting 
cheaper, and almost anyone can acquire one. Many of these devices come equipped 
with powerful cameras. In fact, people have become used to recording their daily 
moments using videos; video-sharing websites allow anyone to upload a video file with 
just a simple click using each site’s app.

 Productivity Tools
In Chapter 2, we covered some useful tools for making your online investigations more 
organized. We deferred mentioning the remaining tools until now as they relate to file- 
searching techniques.
 Screen Capture
Sometimes you need to take a screen capture of the whole screen or part of the screen to 
capture important information (for example, to capture a pop-up message or a portion 
of online map) and include it in your investigation report. There are many tools to 
achieve this; these are two popular solutions:
• 
Awesome Screenshot Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/
firefox/addon/screenshot-capture-annotate/): This is a Firefox 
add-on; it can be used to capture the whole page or any portion of 
it; annotate it with rectangles, circles, arrows, lines, and text; blur 
sensitive information; and much more.

 Download Online Video
Online investigations require you to search and investigate video files to extract useful 
hidden information. Sometimes you may need to save (download) a video from the 
Internet—for example, from a YouTube website—to include it in your investigation or to 
analyze it further. There are many ways to download videos from the Internet; the easiest 
method is to use browser add-ons.
Easy YouTube Video Downloader Express
This is a Firefox add-on to download videos from YouTube. It allows the direct download 
of high-quality video/audio from YouTube (1080p full-HD and 256Kbps MP3) with a 
single click. You can find it at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/
