User: I want to explore and use the driver behavior service in my application. Unfortunately I got stuck as I'm getting empty response from getAnalyzedTripSummary API instead Trip UUID.
Here are the steps I've followed.

I've added the services called Driver behavior and Context Mapping to my application @Bluemix.
Pushed multiple sample data packets to the Driver Behavior using "sendCarProbe" API 
Sent Job Request using "sendJobRequest" API with from and to dates as post data.
Tried "getJobInfo" API, which results the status of job "job_status" : "SUCCEEDED")
Tried "getAnalyzedTripSummaryList" to get trip_uuid. But
its resulting empty. []

Could someone help me to understand what's wrong and why I'm getting empty response?
Assistant: I think your procedure is OK. 
There are following possibilities not to get valid analysis result. 
(1) In current Driving Behavior Analysis, it requires at least 10 valid gps points within a trip (trip_id) on a vehicle (trip_id). Please check your data which is used on "sendCarProbe" API. 
(2) Please check "sendJobRequest" API's from and to date (yyyy-mm-dd) really matches with your car probe timestamp.
