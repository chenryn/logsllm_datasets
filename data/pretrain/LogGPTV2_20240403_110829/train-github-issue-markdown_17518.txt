I'm using the Atom for Windows Alpha from the Atom website (not Chocolatey),
version 0.136.0 (as viewed in the Help menu and with `--version` in the
command line, the `version` file in the Atom folder says v0.17.1; it was
downloaded around 12:30AM US Eastern on October 14, 2014 if that helps) on
Windows 8.1. I set `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;` for `.editor` in
`styles.less` (because otherwise the ligatures aren't in effect and I get each
individual character). This happens regardless of whether hardware
acceleration is enabled. It also happens in `--safe` mode, and the developer
tools console shows no errors.

    ()::Functor f=>(a->b)->(f a->f b)
    fmap::Functor f=>(a->b)->(f a->f b)
in Hasklig, which has ligatures for ``, `::`, `=>`, and `->`.

    fifififififififififi
in Calibri, using the ligature for `fi`. The cursor is at the end of the line,
and the misspell underline only leads up to that point as well. The ligature
for `ff` in Calibri has the opposite effect; the cursor and underline extend
farther than text on the screen if you put enough f's on a line.
I can provide more details if you need them.
