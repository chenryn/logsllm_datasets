ABSTRACT
Accurate broadband coverage data is essential for public policy plan-
ning and government support programs. In the United States, the
Federal Communications Commission is responsible for maintain-
ing national broadband coverage data. Observers have panned the
FCC’s broadband maps for overstating availability, due to coarse-
grained data collection and a low coverage threshold.
We demonstrate a new approach to building broadband coverage
maps: automated large-scale queries to the public availability check-
ing tools offered by major internet service providers. We reverse
engineer the coverage tools for nine major ISPs in the U.S., test over
19 million residential street addresses across nine states for service,
and compare the results to the FCC’s maps.
Our results demonstrate that the FCC’s coverage data signifi-
cantly overstates the availability of each ISP’s service, access to any
broadband, connection speeds available to consumers, and com-
petition in broadband markets. We also find that the FCC’s data
disproportionately overstates coverage in rural and minority com-
munities. Our results highlight a promising direction for developing
more accurate broadband maps and validating coverage reports.

1 INTRODUCTION
Broadband internet access is an essential instrument for advancing
public policy goals, including economic opportunity, educational
attainment, and public health [1, 2]. The United States and the
European Union—along with many other nations and international
organizations—are prioritizing initiatives to increase broadband
availability [3, 4]. Governments worldwide are investing in network
infrastructure and closing the “digital divide” between broadband
haves and have-nots. These policies are especially critical today:

the COVID-19 pandemic has compelled a global shift to working,
attending school, and socializing through broadband connections.
Accurate coverage data is the foundation of efforts to close the
digital divide. Broadband maps guide both overall funding levels
and resource targeting, by identifying areas where infrastructure
investments are most needed. Coverage data also informs related
telecommunications policies, such as net neutrality, broadband pri-
vacy, municipal broadband, and unbundling, by identifying possible
market failures that substantiate regulatory intervention.
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) is responsible for maintaining nationwide broadband cov-
erage data [5]. Stakeholders have criticized the FCC’s maps for
methodological shortcomings that would overstate coverage. There
is wide agreement—including by the FCC’s leadership—that the
current maps are not adequately accurate. But there is little clarity
on what the errors are, and the FCC is just now beginning to revise
its broadband coverage data collection methods.
We investigate a new direction for developing broadband cover-
age maps: automated large-scale measurement of the representa-
tions that ISPs make to prospective customers. Every major ISP in
the U.S. offers a broadband availability tool (BAT) to check whether
an address is eligible for service. We systematically submit resi-
dential address queries to BATs and derive a dataset of U.S. fixed
broadband coverage. We make two main contributions: a rigorous
methodology for generating a coverage dataset from BATs, and a
comparative analysis that estimates errors in the FCC’s maps.
Our methodology begins with reverse engineering the BATs
for nine major ISPs. We examine each BAT with test queries, de-
veloping a preliminary taxonomy of distinct response types and
corresponding outcomes (e.g., the address is covered, not covered, or
unrecognized). Next, we conduct automated data collection, query-
ing the BATs with residential addresses from U.S. Department of
Transportation and U.S. Postal Service data. In total, we query over
19 million addresses across nine states. We iteratively add new BAT
response types to our taxonomy, and we evaluate the accuracy of
our final taxonomy by placing test calls to ISPs. We then use our
taxonomy to convert the BAT responses into a coverage dataset.
We analyze our dataset in comparison to the FCC’s coverage
data, contributing the most rigorous large-scale evaluation of the
FCC’s maps to date. Our results demonstrate that the FCC’s data sig-
nificantly overstates coverage by each ISP, access to any broadband
service, access to higher-speed broadband, and access to competing
providers. We also find the FCC’s data disproportionately overstates
coverage in rural and minority communities.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We provide background
on broadband maps in the U.S., then summarize and compare re-
lated work (Section 2). We then describe our BAT methodology

for generating broadband coverage data (Section 3). Next, we ana-
lyze our dataset in comparison to the FCC’s and discuss the results
(Section 4). We conclude with directions for future work (Section 5).
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we provide background on the FCC’s broadband
maps and their shortcomings. We then describe and compare related
work that evaluates the FCC’s maps and other broadband studies.
2.1 Background on U.S. Broadband Maps
For over two decades, the FCC has been responsible for encouraging
broadband deployment and competition in the U.S. [6]. As part of
that mission, the FCC requires ISPs to file coverage reports, via a
process termed Form 477 [7].1 The FCC then compiles the reports
into a dataset, which it uses to allocate infrastructure subsidies and
evaluate potential regulation. The FCC also makes its coverage data
and an interactive national broadband map available online [9].
Our work focuses on the Form 477 data for fixed broadband, such
as fiber, cable, and DSL. These ISPs are required to submit biannual
reports about service that exceeds 200 kbps in either direction [10].
There are several notable shortcomings to the FCC’s current
fixed coverage methods. First, the FCC collects data at the census
block level. While census blocks are the most granular geographic
units tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, these areas can still en-
compass nearly a thousand housing units (especially in urban areas)
or hundreds to thousands of square miles (especially in rural ar-
eas) [11]. Second, if an ISP reaches one address in a census block, it
reports coverage for the entire census block [12]. Third, even if an
ISP does not currently reach a census block, it still reports coverage
if it could soon provide service to an address in the block.2
The FCC’s current data collection methods necessarily lead to in-
accurate coverage analysis, because the resulting broadband maps
do not account for incomplete coverage within census blocks and
do not distinguish between actual and potential coverage. When
the FCC conducts analysis with its current maps—for annual re-
ports on broadband deployment [13], subsidy programs [14], policy
planning [15], and myriad other purposes—it treats coverage for the
geography, residences, and individuals within each census block as
all-or-nothing. Independent analysis relying on the FCC’s coverage
data similarly assumes—because it must—that reported coverage in
a census block means complete coverage for the block [16–18].
Erroneous coverage reports are another source of inaccuracy
in the FCC’s data. Unfortunately, the FCC’s ability to detect these
errors is very limited. In 2019, for example, FCC staff conducted on-
the-ground tests of the Verizon, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular mobile
networks in 12 states [19, 20]. The staff report concluded that Form
477 data from all three providers so “generally overstated” coverage
and performance that the data was not “generally reliable.” Earlier
this year, AT&T notified the FCC that it had mistakenly reported
fixed (i.e., non-mobile) coverage since 2017 in over 3,500 census
blocks across 20 states [21]. Also this year, the FCC initiated penalty
proceedings against BarrierFree—a local fixed ISP in New York—for
1The original Form 477 involved mailing paperwork and a floppy disk [8]. While the
FCC’s data collection is now online, the FCC has retained the name.
2The FCC ambiguously directs ISPs to report coverage if they could provide service
“within a service interval that is typical for that type of connection—that is, without
an extraordinary commitment of resources” [12].

submitting years of inaccurate coverage data [22]. In one Form
477 filing, BarrierFree claimed to provide service from Connecticut
through Virginia. In another filing, the ISP claimed to serve an
impossible number of customers in an area—over ten times the
number of housing units. The FCC relied on BarrierFree’s reports
until a civil society group spotted the errors [23].
For clarity throughout our work, we delineate two types of in-
accuracy that result from the FCC’s broadband coverage data. An
“overstatement” is an instance where the FCC data indicates a geog-
raphy, residence, or individual is covered, but broadband service is
not actually available. An overstatement may be attributable to the
FCC’s methods or to an ISP’s error. “Overreporting” is the specific
type of overstatement caused by a mistaken ISP filing.
The FCC’s maps have been widely criticized for inaccurately re-
flecting U.S. broadband availability, performance, and competition,
including by members of the FCC, legislators, executive officials,
civil society groups, and ISPs [5, 24–27]. In 2019, the FCC began
taking steps to overhaul its broadband coverage data collection
methods and restructure the Form 477 process as a new Digital
Opportunity Data Collection [28]. Congress required additional
updates in the Broadband DATA Act earlier this year [29], and
the FCC issued further revisions in response [30]. In the updated
FCC data collection process, ISPs will be required to submit fixed
coverage data by providing either geospatial polygons or address
lists. The methods for generating these polygons or lists—and their
accuracy—will be left up to ISPs, subject only to lax technology-
specific maximum buffer zones (e.g., for fiber, a provider may have
latitude to report service within 35 miles of its optical terminals).
Meanwhile, ISPs already maintain broadband coverage data at
much finer granularity than the census blocks that the FCC cur-
rently uses and the maximum buffer zones that the FCC plans to
use. For example, ISPs keep exact address-level records for current
and past subscribers. Moreover, every major ISP offers a public
broadband availability tool (BAT) on its website that responds to
address-level queries. ISPs have meaningful economic incentives to
maintain accurate BATs, because a false negative is a missed poten-
tial customer and a false positive is a waste of resources attempting
to provide service. While we cannot definitively determine the
granularity of coverage data that BATs rely on when responding to
queries, we have consistently observed that BATs provide coverage
data at finer granularity than the geographic scale of both census
blocks and the FCC’s new maximum buffer zones.
2.2 Related Work
There have been three notable efforts to examine the accuracy of
the FCC’s fixed broadband coverage data. In 2019, Microsoft studied
the related problem of U.S. broadband usage. Microsoft measured
the network speed for users of its services, geolocated users to
ZIP codes based on IP addresses, and then compared the resulting
usage data to the FCC’s maps [31]. The Microsoft study estimated
that, as of November 2019, about 157 million Americans were not
using broadband service at the FCC’s benchmark minimum of 25
Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. Microsoft inferred from its
results that the FCC’s maps pervasively overstate coverage [32].
In comparison to Microsoft’s work, we collect data on broadband

availability rather than usage, we do not rely on IP geolocation, and
our data is much more granular than ZIP codes.
BroadbandNow, a portal for consumers to compare broadband
service offerings, conducted a concurrent study of the FCC’s cov-
erage data [33]. The study methodology was similar to our own:
BroadbandNow manually queried BATs for nine ISPs using 11,663
addresses, totaling 20,065 address-ISP combinations. Broadband-
Now found that 19.6% of address-ISP combinations resulted in a
BAT response other than service available, and 13.0% of addresses
did not have any relevant BAT indicating service. The report in-
ferred from these results that the number of Americans without
broadband access is double FCC estimates. BroadbandNow also hy-
pothesized that overstatements in Form 477 data disproportionately
impact rural states, because a larger population proportion in those
states already lacks coverage according to the FCC’s data. While
the BroadbandNow report is a valuable contribution, it differs from
our work in several important methodological respects: we rigor-
ously source and format comprehensive residential address lists, we
develop and evaluate a full taxonomy mapping BAT responses to
coverage outcomes, and we collect orders of magnitude more data
by using automation. Our analysis also includes evaluation of over-
statements for speed and competition, as well as disproportionate
overstatements for rural and minority communities.
CostQuest Associates, a telecommunications consulting firm,
conducted a 2019 pilot study of the FCC’s maps in Missouri and Vir-
ginia [34].3 CostQuest developed a “fabric” of serviceable building
structures using proprietary methods that synthesized property tax
records, parcel records, address data, road data, satellite imagery,
and crowdworker labeling. The report then used coverage data
from an unspecified number of collaborating ISPs to evaluate the
accuracy of the FCC’s broadband maps. CostQuest concluded that
the FCC’s data overstated participating ISP coverage for 16% of
structures in Missouri and for 19% of structures in Virginia. We
cannot more directly compare our work to CostQuest’s, because
we do not have access to the proprietary methods and data.
In addition to the FCC, other government agencies are compil-
ing broadband coverage data. The National Telecommunications
and Information Administration is developing a National Broad-
band Availability Map, which integrates FCC, state, and commercial
data [36]. The California Public Utilities Commission also has an
initiative to collect state-level broadband coverage data [37].
3The study was commissioned by USTelecom, the U.S. ISP trade group [35].

Our work is situated in the networking literature on broadband
connectivity. Prior work has measured the broadband performance
that subscribers experience [38–45], investigated demographic dis-
parities (“digital redlining”) in broadband coverage through manual
speed tests and mapping [46–48], and examined how ISPs can effi-
ciently connect underserved communities [49, 50].
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe our methods for creating a dataset of
U.S. fixed broadband coverage using automated large-scale address
queries to ISP BATs. We begin by selecting nine major ISPs to study,
based on the FCC’s Form 477 data (Section 3.1). We then generate
a set of over 19 million residential addresses across nine states
to query for coverage, using U.S. Department of Transportation
(USDOT) and U.S. Postal Service (USPS) address data (Section 3.2).
Next, we reverse engineer the BAT for each ISP we study, building
both a client and a preliminary taxonomy for interpreting responses
(Section 3.3). We use our BAT client to accomplish large-scale data
collection, querying ISP-address combinations where, according
to FCC data, an address is covered by an ISP (Section 3.4). We
iteratively add new BAT response types to our taxonomy during our
data collection (Section 3.5), and we evaluate the final taxonomy by
manually checking that addresses exist and placing test telephone
calls to ISPs (Section 3.6). Fig. 1 presents an overview of the steps
in our methodology. We are intentionally conservative at each
step, because BATs are black-box systems from our perspective; we
present results with less conservative methods in Appendix I.
3.1 Selecting ISPs
We study nine broadband providers, which we term “major” ISPs:
AT&T, CenturyLink, Charter, Comcast, Consolidated, Cox, Frontier,
Verizon, and Windstream. We choose these providers for two rea-
sons. First, the major ISPs represent most of the broadband market:
according to the FCC’s Form 477 coverage data and population
estimates, these ISPs have large geographic footprints and together
reach over 90% of the population that has access to broadband in the
states that we study. Second, each of the major ISPs we study has a
BAT that we can reliably query with residential addresses [52–60].
The broadband market includes a number of small providers,
which we term “local” ISPs. These providers typically do not have
a public BAT, so we cannot measure coverage with our methods.
In the states that we study, we consider every provider that is not a

Table 1: We compile a dataset of residential addresses by starting with the USDOT NAD, excluding addresses that lack essential
fields or are categorized as non-residential, validating against USPS data, and filtering for broadband coverage according to

major ISP to be a local ISP.4 We also treat major ISPs as local ISPs
in states where they have limited market presence, owing to how
we prioritized data collection (see Appendix A for detail).
We conservatively assume that local ISPs have 100% availability
within census blocks that they report to the FCC as covered. Local
ISPs do (collectively) have broad coverage (Appendix C), so our
analysis of access to broadband is very sensitive to this assumption.
We present results from relaxing the assumption in Appendix I.
We use the FCC’s Form 477 data from June 2019 [12] and the
FCC’s census block population estimates from 2018 [61]. Both
datasets were the most recent available when we began this study.
3.2 Selecting Residential Addresses
After identifying ISPs for study, we compile a dataset of residential
addresses for our queries and analysis. We rely on USDOT, USPS,
and U.S. Census Bureau data. Table 1 presents counts for each step
in our address validation process. In total, our dataset includes
nearly 20 million addresses that are served by at least one ISP and
19.4 million addresses that are served by at least one major ISP.
The USDOT National Address Database (NAD) is an ongoing
initiative to create a comprehensive federal public database of ad-
dresses and associated locations [62, 63]. USDOT receives data from
state, county, and municipal agencies, then consolidates and stan-
dardizes records [64]. The NAD includes basic address fields (e.g.,
address number and street name), latitude and longitude coordi-
nates, and an optional address type (e.g., residential or commercial).
We limit our study to nine states where the NAD includes address
data and where the major ISPs are the predominant providers.5
We process the NAD addresses into a dataset of residential query
addresses with four steps. First, we filter for and standardize essen-
tial fields. We begin with the set of NAD addresses in each of the
nine states, and we exclude addresses that are missing an address
4We treat Altice as a local ISP in New York, for reasons explained in Appendix B.

our analysis for incomplete census blocks.

number, street name, municipality/community, or ZIP code, since
these fields are typically required by BATs. We also normalize street
suffixes according to USPS address standards [65], because we find
that certain BATs require properly formatted addresses.6
Second, where the NAD includes an address type, we filter out
non-residential categories. We retain addresses categorized as multi-
use, unknown, or other because we find many of these addresses
are residential and USPS data provides an effective further filter.
Third, we verify the remaining addresses against two USPS
datasets, which we access through a commercial provider [66].
We confirm that each address is able to receive ordinary postal
mail with USPS Delivery Point Validation [67]. We further confirm
that each address is residential by checking the USPS Residential
Delivery Indicator [68], which labels whether an address is subject
to residential rates for mail delivery.
