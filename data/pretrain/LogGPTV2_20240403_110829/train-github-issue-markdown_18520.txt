### Problem description
When props.animated is true, Popover calls setState from within a setTimeout.
    // in componentWillReceiveProps
    if (nextProps.animated) {
       this.setState({ closing: true });
       this.timeout = setTimeout(function () {
         _this2.setState({
            open: false
         });
       }, 500);
    }
Because componentWillReceiveProps doesn't mean that props changed, Popover has
the potential to call setState from within the setTimeout multiple times, when
no props have changed. For me, this is consistently causing an error where
setState is called on an unmounted component.
### Steps to reproduce
Rapidly re-render Popover (animated=true) after having changed open to false.
