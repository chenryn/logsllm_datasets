User: I wanted to update my python 2.6.1 to 3.x on mac but i was wondering if its possible to do it using terminal or i have to download the installer from python website? 
The reason why i am asking this question is because installer is not updating my terminal python version.
Assistant: I believe Python 3 can coexist with Python 2. Try invoking it using "python3" or "python3.1". If it fails, you might need to uninstall 2.6 before installing 3.1.
