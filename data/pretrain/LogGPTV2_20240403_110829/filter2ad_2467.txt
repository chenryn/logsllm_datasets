ABSTRACT
Smartphone users are facing serious threat of privacy leak-
age. This privacy leakage is caused not only by malicious
applications (apps), but also by the most popular apps in
one’s pocket. In this poster, we present our study on the is-
sues of information leakage caused by the most widely used
apps in Chinese app markets. Our goal is to ﬁnd what infor-
mation is exposed by each popular app, and then to focus
on the following three questions in order to explore the inﬂu-
ence of this kind of information leakage: (1) to what extent
can the information leaked by an app be used to characterize
the user’s behaviors? (2) to what extent can the informa-
tion leaked by a number of apps in the same smartphone be
used to characterize the user’s behaviors? and (3) whether
the leaked information from a number of smartphones can
be integrated to predict the social behaviors? Preliminary
experimental results on the top 50 popular apps in Chinese
app markets show the serious situation of this kind of infor-
mation leakage.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, Android-powered smartphones have be-
come very popular in both personal and business uses. Ac-
cording to a report from the International Data Corpora-
tion (IDC) [5], Android-powered smartphones dominate the
market with a 78% share in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015, while
according to a statistical result from AppBrain [2], the num-
ber of apps in Google Play has reached 1.5 million. However,
most of the Android apps are only installed by a few people.
In contrast, a number of apps are very popular in all kinds

of users, especially the apps in the top 50 list [1]. Most of
users have installed more than one app in the top 50 list in
their smartphones.
As a portable device, the smartphone stores a lot of per-
sonal information. The usage information of the smart-
phone also reﬂects the users’ habits, interests or relation-
ships. Hence, the privacy on the Android-powered smart-
phones is a big issue. In previous work, researchers made
their eﬀorts to detect malicious apps that steal users’ pri-
vacy [6] and to develop tools [4][7] that are used to discover
the privacy leakage paths in apps. However, there is little at-
tention paid to privacy leakage caused by the most popular
apps developed by reputed companies or groups. These apps
are normally in the Antivirus companies’ Whitelists and are
not alerted. However, the developers of these popular apps
also have the motivation to collect users’ usage information
of their apps in order to improve their apps’ quality. If the
collected information is not well protected, it can be exposed
to any network sniﬀers between the apps and their servers,
resulting in serious privacy leakage.
In this poster, we present our preliminary study on the
information leakage issues caused by the most popular apps
in Chinese app markets. We design a tool called ILDDroid
(Information Leakage Discover Droid) to discover the private
information leaked by the popular apps. ILDDroid tries to
discover unknown private information leakage, not just the
information protected by Android permissions. Based on
the analysis results from ILDDroid, we aim to answer the
following three questions to explore the inﬂuence of this kind
of information leakage:
• to what extent can the user be identiﬁed or character-
ized with the information leaked by an app?
• to what extent can the user be identiﬁed or character-
ized with the information leaked by a number of apps
in the same smartphone?
• is it possible to divide users into diﬀerent groups and
to predict the social behaviors of these groups based
on the leaked information from a number of users (or
smartphones)?
We conduct preliminary experiments on the top 50 popu-
lar apps in Chinese app markets. The experimental results
show a serious situation of this kind of information leakage.
The popular apps in one’s pocket not only send out smart-
phones’ hardware information that can be used to uniquely
identify one’s smartphones, but also expose when and where
one uses these apps and even how long one spends on each
1653item in one app. We believe that this information is enough
to distinguish an individual user. More extensive experi-
ments for groups’ behaviors prediction are being conducted.
2. SYSTEM DESIGN
Diﬀerent from the previous state-of-art Android analysis
tools [3][4], ILDDroid tries to discover unknown private in-
formation leakage at the app’s runtime. According to Zhou’s
[7] research results, it is possible to identify a user based
on the leaked information that is not protected by Android
permissions. Hence, ILDDroid captures the network traﬃc
data between the apps and their servers at ﬁrst. Then the
captured data is analyzed to distinguish the data sent for
asking services and the data sent for collecting users’ usage
information. We analyze the network traﬃc data sent for
collecting users’ usage information to discover what infor-
mation they leak. For some apps that send encrypted data,
we analyze the disassembled codes and running a modiﬁed
version of these apps to ﬁnd out what information is sent.
ILDDroid can be divided into two parts: network traﬃc an-
alyzer and app analyzer. We illustrate the system overview
in Figure 1.
2.2 App Analyzer
In order to discover the information transmitted by the
encrypted data, we developed an app analyzer that performs
both static analysis and dynamic analysis to ﬁnd out what
information is encrypted semi-automatically.
• Static analysis. The static analysis process is per-
formed as shown in Figure 2. First, the analyzer ﬁnds
out the Urls obtained from the network traﬃc ana-
lyzer in the apps’ disassembled codes. Second, the
analyzer identiﬁes where these Urls are used. Third,
the data sent with these Urls are tainted. Afterwards,
static taint analysis is performed to discover the origi-
nal data. This static analysis can ﬁnd out many static
data, such as the encrypted IMEI, Network informa-
tion etc.. If there are some unknown method that in-
vokes on the taint paths, we mark these points as in-
teresting points and leave them to dynamic analysis.
Figure 2: Static analysis process
• Dynamic analysis. The dynamic analysis is performed
based on the results of the static analysis. We in-
ject some monitoring codes into the apps’ disassem-
bled codes at the points we are interested. The in-
jected monitoring codes catch the runtime information
we want and output it through the apps’ log ﬁle. By
running the repackaged modiﬁed apps, we understand
what information is exposed.
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUS-
SIONS
We conduct an experiment on the top 50 popular apps in
Chinese app markets, each of them has more than 19 million
monthly active users. We list some analysis results in Table
1.
The table shows the current serious situation of the in-
formation leakage caused by the popular apps. Most of the
apps in the top 50 list transmit their collected users’ in-
formation through unsafe ways, except the apps developed
by big companies like Tencent and Alibaba. Some of these
apps send the unencrypted collected data in JSON format
directly, like “{“IMEI”:351554053490182}”. Some of them
just simply change the label of the data, such as change the
“{“IMEI”:351554053490182}” to “{“td”:351554053490182}”.
The other of them encrypt the collected data with AES.
But the keys are generated from current time. It is easily
compromised by analyzing the apps’ disassembled codes.
What is worse, the information collected by these pop-
ular apps is far more than the users imagine. It not only
contains the smartphone’s hardware information, but also
contains the detailed usage information as shown in Table
Figure 1: System Overview
2.1 Network Trafﬁc Analyzer
Network traﬃc analyzer captures the network traﬃc be-
tween the apps and their servers at ﬁrst. We just capture the
data transmitted through HTTP protocol. In our work, we
set up a WiFi hotspot with a computer and run a network
sniﬀer on that computer. An Android-powered smartphone
is connected to this hotspot. Network traﬃc data generated
by the apps running on the smartphone are totally logged in
the computer. We run each app for several minutes and trig-
ger most of their functions. After the network traﬃc data
are logged, we ﬁnd out the data transmitted for collecting
users’ usage information by the following rules: (1) Key-
words in the target Urls, such as “register”, “log” or “collect”
etc.; (2) Keywords in the transmitted data, such as “time”,
“imei”, or “action” etc.. This rule is not available for the
encrypted data; (3) Returned data once data is sent. If the
server returns nothing or just returns a status as “success”
or “error” after the app send a lot of data, these data may
contain users’ usage information.
Once we ﬁnd out the network traﬃc data sent for col-
lecting users’ usage information, we manually identify what
privacy may be leaked.

1. The usage information is generated by the apps and is
not protected by Android permissions.
It is therefore not
cared by the third-party security companies. A single app
may collect limited information from the users and may not
leak users’ privacy. However, multi-apps in the same smart-
phone actually leaks users’ privacy. For example, if a user
has installed the apps in Table 1, his address, reading in-
terest and favorite songs are totally exposed to intentional
monitors. The user’s age can also be inferred.
Another question is the information leakage caused by the
third-party analysis libraries in these apps. Apps package
some third-party analysis libraries into themselves and send
collected usage information to these third-party companies.
These third-party companies analyze the collected data and
give the developers a report of the usage of their apps. If
a user has installed several apps containing the same third-
party libraries, these third-party companies can easily ob-
tain the usage information from diﬀerent apps in one smart-
phone. The user’s identity and other private information are
thus leaked.
For the prediction of social behaviors, extended experi-
ments are being conducted. We plan to extend our exper-
iments to cover the top 200 popular apps in Chinese app
markets. These top 200 apps almost cover every aspects of
our daily life. In addition, we will capture the network traﬃc
from a large number of users.
4. CONCLUSION
In this poster, we explore the information leakage caused
by the most popular apps. We design a tool called ILD-
Droid that is used to analyze what information is leaked by
the widely used apps. The preliminary experimental results
show that the user’s privacy is leaked by the popular apps in
pocket. We are conducting extensive experiments to study
the feasibility of predicting the social behaviors of diﬀerent
groups of users.
