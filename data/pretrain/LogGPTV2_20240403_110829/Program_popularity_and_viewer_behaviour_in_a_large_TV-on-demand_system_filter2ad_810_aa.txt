## Abstract
The distribution of TV and video content over IP networks and the Internet is growing. Understanding TV program popularity and access patterns in real networks is crucial for traffic and cache management. This paper analyzes access patterns in a large TV-on-Demand system over four months, focusing on user behavior, program popularity, and their impact on caching.

We observe significant variations in demand, with high peaks on Friday and Saturday evenings. The cacheability, defined as the share of requests that are not first-time requests, is very high. A small set of programs accounts for a large fraction of the requests. During prime time, the share of requests for the most popular programs increases, and the change rate among them decreases, which is important for caching. The cache hit ratio also increases during peak demand times, making caching more effective when it matters most.

Additionally, we examine the popularity of individual programs and how it changes over time, noting that the type of programs offered influences the access pattern.

## 1. Introduction
The distribution of TV and video content over IP networks and the Internet is increasing. Many telecom and broadband companies now offer TV services using IP multicast. These services are evolving towards TV-on-Demand and time-shifted viewing, where users can watch programs at their convenience. Distributing individual TV streams to each viewer requires substantial bandwidth and server capacity. Therefore, understanding how to effectively use caching of popular content closer to viewers is essential to reduce network load.

In this paper, we study access patterns in a large TV-on-Demand system over four months, focusing on user behavior and program popularity and their impact on caching. Our work differs from previous studies of IPTV systems, which primarily focus on traditional scheduled TV distributed over IP networks. Instead, we examine TV-on-Demand, where viewers choose programs outside the TV schedule, and the content is transferred via unicast streams.

Our main contributions are:
1. An investigation of program popularity and access patterns in a real TV-on-Demand network.
2. A trace-based study of caching, characterizing access patterns for different program categories, showing how program popularity changes over time, and examining cache hit ratios for different cache sizes, replacement policies, and population sizes.

## 2. The Data Set
We analyze logs from the TeliaSonera TV-on-Demand service, which offers a mix of TV program libraries, time-shifted viewing, and rental videos. The data set includes RTSP session logs with timestamps, AssetIDs, and additional information about providers and program descriptions.

Table 1 summarizes the data set, which contains TV-on-Demand requests over 125 days between May 12th and September 13th, 2011. It includes more than 300,000 clients making over ten million requests. Figure 1 shows the number of requests, active clients, and distinct programs requested per day, highlighting weekly cycles with increased activity during weekends.

Figure 2 provides a log-log plot of the number of requests per client, showing that 5% of the viewers account for 41% of the requests, and 20% of the viewers account for 75% of the requests.

## 3. Access Patterns
### 3.1 Access Pattern Over a Week
Figure 3 shows the number of requests per hour during one week, revealing significant daily and weekly variations in demand, with large peaks in the evenings, especially on Friday and Saturday. The number of distinct programs requested per hour follows a similar pattern but with less pronounced peaks.

Figure 4 illustrates the share of requests per hour that the top 100 most popular programs account for, showing that their share increases during prime time.

### 3.2 Daily and Hourly Change in User Interest
Figure 5a shows the daily change among the top 100 and top 1000 most requested programs, indicating that 73% of the requested programs are the same as the previous day. There is a weekly pattern with less change in the top 100 during weekends.

## 4. Program Popularity
We find that the popularity of rental movies, news, and TV shows changes over time in different ways. News programs are often only requested for a few hours, while movies remain popular for months and increase in rank during weekends. TV shows increase in rank when the next episode is shown, and children's programs are top-ranked in the mornings and early evenings.

The program popularity conforms to the Pareto principle, with the 2% most popular programs accounting for 48% of the requests, and the 20% most popular programs accounting for 84% of the requests.

## 5. Caching Impact
The cacheability is very high, with a hit ratio above 50% when caching 5% of the average daily demand. The hit ratio increases during prime time, making caching more effective when it is needed most.

## 6. Related Work
Several studies have examined viewing behavior in IPTV systems, focusing on TV channel popularity and channel switching. Our work is unique in its focus on TV-on-Demand, where viewers choose programs outside the TV schedule.

## 7. Future Work
Future work will include further analysis of caching strategies and their impact on network performance, as well as an examination of the influence of new content types on access patterns.

## 8. Conclusion
Understanding TV program popularity and access patterns in TV-on-Demand systems is crucial for effective traffic and cache management. Our study provides insights into these patterns and their implications for caching, offering valuable guidance for optimizing network performance.
