words, given the queries/answers that the adversary receives, the conditional min-entropy of each
hash key Li is at least n − lg(n).
We ﬁrst bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad1]. For each entry (enc, i, N,·,·,·,·), there are at most
d other entries (enc, j, N,·,·,·,·) such that j (cid:54)= i, and the chance that one of those d entries satisfy
Kj = Ki is at most d/2k. Summing over at most q encryption entries,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad1] ≤ dq
2k .
Next, we bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad2]. Consider an entry (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)).
Since we are in the ideal world, the strings V0, . . . , V(cid:96) are uniformly random and independent. Thus
the chance that there are 0 ≤ s < t ≤ (cid:96) such that Vs = Vt is at most
(cid:96)((cid:96) + 1)
2n+1 ≤ (cid:96)B
2n ≤ |M|n · B

.
Summing this over all encryption queries,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad2] ≤ σB

Next, we bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad3]. For each entry (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)),
consider another entry (enc, j, N(cid:48), A(cid:48), M(cid:48), T (cid:48) (cid:107) C(cid:48), V (cid:48)
u). Since we are in the ideal world, the
strings V0, . . . , V(cid:96), V (cid:48)
u are uniformly random and independent, and thus the chance that
t is at most ((cid:96) + 1)(u + 1)/2n ≤ (|M|n +|A|n)(|M(cid:48)|n +|A(cid:48)|n)/2n. We
there are s, t such that Vs = V (cid:48)
consider the following cases.
0, . . . , V (cid:48)
0 ··· V (cid:48)
Case 1: i = j, and thus Ki = Kj. By summing over all encryption entries of user j, we obtain a
bound (|M|n +|A|n)B/2n for the particular entry (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)) above. Summing
this over all encryption entries, the probability corresponding to this case is at most σB/2n.
Case 2: i (cid:54)= j, and thus the conditional probability that Ki = Kj is 2−k. Summing over all pairs
of encryption entries, we obtain a bound σ2/2k+n for this case.
Summing up,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad3] ≤ σB
2n +
σ2
2k+n .
We now bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad4]. For each encryption entry (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C,
V0 ··· V(cid:96)), the strings V0, . . . , V(cid:96) are uniformly random and independent of Li, and thus the chance
that there is some Vs such that Vs = Li is at most ((cid:96) + 1)/2n ≤ (|M|n + |A|n)/2n. Summing this
over all encryption entries,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad4] ≤ σ
2n .
Next, we bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad5]. For each entry (prim, K, x, y), there are at most
d entries (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)) such that x ∈ {pad(N ), . . . , pad(N ) + (cid:96)}, and the chance
that one of those d entries satisﬁes Ki = K is at most d/2k. Summing over all p ideal-cipher queries,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad5] ≤ dp
2k .
Next, we bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad6]. View each entry (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96))
as throwing (cid:96) + 1 ≤ |M|n + |A|n balls into bins V0, . . . , V(cid:96). Hence totally, we throw at most σ balls
into 2n bins, and the throws are uniformly random. Using Lemma 3.4, with probability at least
1 − 2−8n, each bin contains at most n balls. Thus for each entry (prim, K, x, y,·), there are at most
n entries (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)) such that y ∈ {V0, . . . , V(cid:96)}, and the chance that one of
those n entries satisﬁes Ki = K is at most n/2k. Summing over all p ideal-cipher queries,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad6] ≤ 2−8n +
pn
2k .
We now bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad7]. Consider an entry (vf, i, N, A(cid:48), T (cid:48) (cid:107) C(cid:48)). Since the
adversary is d-repeating, there are at most d entries (enc, j, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)) of the same
nonce N . We consider the following cases.
Case 1: j = i. As H is c-AXU and the conditional min-entropy of Li is at least n − lg(n), the
chance that HLi(A(cid:48), C(cid:48))⊕T (cid:48) = HLi(A, C)⊕T is at most
nc(|C(cid:48)|n + |A(cid:48)|n + |C|n + |A|n)/2n .
Summing that over all veriﬁcation queries, the probability corresponding to this case is at most
ncσ/2n.
14
Case 2: j (cid:54)= i. As H is c-AXU and the conditional min-entropy of Li is at least n − lg(n), the
chance that HLi(A(cid:48), C(cid:48))⊕T (cid:48) = HLi(A, C)⊕T is at most
nc(|C(cid:48)|n + |A(cid:48)|n + |C|n + |A|n)/2n .
Conditioning on HLi(A(cid:48), C(cid:48))⊕T (cid:48) = HLi(A, C)⊕T , the chance that Ki = Kj is at most 2−k. Sum-
ming this over all veriﬁcation queries and all d matching encryption entries, the probability corre-
sponding to this case is at most ncdσ/2k+n.
Combining both cases,
Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad7] ≤ ncσ
2n +
ncdσ
2k+n .
Finally, we bound the probability Pr[Tideal ∈ Bad8]. We consider the following cases.
Case 1: The event Tideal ∈ Bad8 is caused by a prim entry of sign −. Again, view each entry
(prim, K, x, y,−), as throwing a ball into bin y. Thus we throw at most p balls into 2n bins, and
while the throws can be inter-dependent, their distribution satisﬁes the requirement of Lemma 3.4
due to the hypothesis that p ≤ 2n−2. Then by Lemma 3.4, with probability at least 1 − 2−8n, the
heaviest bin contains at most n balls. Hence for each entry (vf, i, N, A, T (cid:107) C), there are at most
n entries (prim, K, x, y,−) such that x = pad(N ), and the chance that one of those prim entries
satisﬁes the property K = Ki is at most n/2k. Summing over all q veriﬁcation queries, the chance
that this case happens is at most 2−8n + qn/2k.
Case 2: The event Tideal ∈ Bad8 is caused by a prim entry of sign + and a prior Vf query.
Consider an entry (prim, K, x, y, +). The chance that there is a prior entry (vf, i, N, A, T (cid:107) C) such
that HL(A, C)⊕T = y, with L ← EK(0n), and Ki = K is at most q/2k(2n − p) ≤ 2q/2k+n.
Summing over all p ideal-cipher queries, the chance that this case happens is at most 2pq/2k+n.
Case 3: The event Tideal ∈ Bad8 is caused by a prim entry of sign + and a subsequent Vf query. Fix
(i∗, N∗, A∗, C∗) and let (cid:96) = |C∗|n +|A∗|n. View each entry (prim, K, x, y, +) as throwing a ball into
bin y⊕HL(A∗, C∗), where L ← EK(0n). Thus we throw at most p balls into 2n bins, and while the
throws can be inter-dependent, their distribution satisﬁes the requirement of Lemma 3.4 due to the
hypothesis that p ≤ 2n−2. Then by Lemma 3.4, with probability at least 1− 2−(3(cid:96)+2)n, the heaviest
bin contains at most (cid:96)n/2 balls. Thus for any adaptive choice of T , the entry (vf, i∗, N∗, A∗, T (cid:107) C∗)
has at most n(cid:96)/2 corresponding entries (prim, K, x, y,−) such that y⊕HL(A∗, C∗) = T , with L ←
EK(0n). Then for any adaptive entry (vf, i, N, A, T (cid:107) C), the chance that it has at most n(|C|n +
|A|n) corresponding entries (prim, K, x, y,−) such that y⊕HL(A, C) = T , with L ← EK(0n), is at
least

22n .
Moreover, the probability that one of those n(|C|n +|A|n) entries (prim, K, x, y, +) satisﬁes K = Ki
is at most n(|C|n + |A|n)/2k. Summing over all veriﬁcation queries, the chance that this case
happens is at most nσ/2k + 2q/22n.

Transcript Ratio. Fix a good transcript τ . For a key K ∈ {0, 1}k, let the multi-set S1(K) be the
union of {(x, y) | (prim, K, x, y,·) ∈ τ} and the set {(0n, EK(0n))} as indicated by τ . Next, initialize
the multi-set S2(K) as the empty set, and for every entry (enc, i, N, A, M, T (cid:107) C, V0 ··· V(cid:96)) ∈ τ , if
τ indicates that Ki = K then add the pairs (pad(N ), V0), . . . , (pad(N ) + (cid:96), V(cid:96)) to S2(K). Finally,
initialize the multi-set S3(K) as the empty set, and for every (vf, i, N, A, T (cid:107) C) ∈ τ , if τ indicates
that Ki = K and there is no entry of the form (pad(N ),·) or (·, Z) in S1(K) ∪ S2(K), where
Z ← HLi(A, C)⊕T , then add the pair (pad(N ), Z) to S3(K). Let
(cid:88)
|S3(K)|
s =

which is at most the total number of veriﬁcation queries. Thus s ≤ q.
Suppose that this transcript τ contains exactly u users. Then in the ideal world, since τ is good,

On the other hand, in the real world, the multi-sets S1(K) and S2(K) indicate pairs (x, y) such
that EK(x) must be y, and the multi-set S3(K) indicate pairs (u, v) such that EK(u) must not be
v. Since τ is good, those multi-sets contain no conﬂicting information, and S1(K) and S2(K) are
disjoint. Let V (K) = |S1(K)| + |S2(K)|. Note that V (K) + |S3(K)| ≤ σ + q + p + 1 ≤ 2n−1. Then
