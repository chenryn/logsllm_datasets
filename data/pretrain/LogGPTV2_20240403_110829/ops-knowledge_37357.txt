User: Hi I am trying to use f2py in macosx.
I have a homebrew python instalation and I have installed numpy using pip.
If I write on terminal f2py I get -bash: f2py: command not found but if I write in a python script import numpy.f2pyit works well.
How can I solve this problem runing f2py directly from terminal?
Thank you!
Assistant: I had a similar problem (installed numpy with pip on macosx, but got f2py not found). In my case f2py was indeed in a location on my $PATH (/Users/username/Library/Python/2.7/bin), but had no execute permissions set. Once that was fixed all was fine.
