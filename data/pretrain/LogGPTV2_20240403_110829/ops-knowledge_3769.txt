User: How to install and use Docker in Ubuntu system?
Assistant: Docker is an open source platform for quickly building, publishing, testing and running applications. It leverages container technology to enable applications to run seamlessly across a variety of different operating systems and programming languages. The following describes how to install and use Docker in the Ubuntu system: 1. Install Docker First, you need to install Docker. In Ubuntu 16.04 and later, Docker can be installed using the apt-get command. Open a terminal and run the following commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install docker.io After the installation is complete, you can verify the version number with the following command: docker --version 2. Using Docker After the installation is complete, you can use the following command to verify Is Docker successfully installed: sudo docker run hello-world This command will download and run a simple hello-world container from Docker Hub. If the output resembles the following, Docker installed successfully. Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. 3. Basic operation To run an Ubuntu container as an example, you can execute the following command: sudo docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash This command will start a new container , and enter the shell inside the container. The commands executed in the container are the same as those executed in the local Ubuntu system. After performing operations, you can use the exit command to exit the container. 4. Build and publish custom images Docker also allows you to build custom images to run your own applications. You need to write a Dockerfile and then use the Docker build tool to build your own image. For example: FROM ubuntu:16.04 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx COPY index.html /var/www/html/ CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"] The Dockerfile starts with Ubuntu 16.04 is the base image, in which nginx is installed, and a file named index.html is copied to the default nginx root directory. After creating the Dockerfile, you can build a new image with the following command: sudo docker build -t my-nginx-image . This command will use the Dockerfile in the current directory to build the image and mark it as "my-nginx-image" . After the build is complete, the following command can be used to start a new container with the newly built image as its base image: sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-nginx-image This command will run a new container in the background , to make the nginx service available by mapping port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host. The above is the basic process of installing and using Docker in the Ubuntu system, and you can also have a deeper understanding of Docker for better use.
