User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Should I be worried if I accidentally entered my password in a username field? Occasionally I will fail to hit Tab properly when entering a username/password combination.  This results in me submitting username "myUsername$ecretPa$$word" along with a blank password.  I always try to change my password shortly after doing this, fearing that it's entirely possible that someone maintaining the site is logging failed login attempts.  It seems reasonable that someone (even a security-conscious admin) would consider logging attempted usernames both useful and safe.  But if this happens my password would be stored in some unencrypted log somewhere, right along with my username.

Is this a reasonable concern?  Am I being too paranoid?

Assistant: The short answer is that it is very, very likely that your concatenated username and password exist on an unencrypted log somewhere that a larger group of people would conceivably have access to than the restricted logs.

You are not paranoid to change your password and should change it when this happens.
