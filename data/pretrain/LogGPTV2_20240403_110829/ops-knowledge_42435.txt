I am currently working on a Windows system with Python and virtualenv. I would like to have setup and teardown scripts that are triggered upon the activation and deactivation of a virtual environment. However, I'm uncertain whether such hooks already exist, and if so, where they can be found.

One option I considered is modifying the `activate.bat` file, but then I wondered if using `activate.py` instead would be more appropriate. If `activate.py` calls `activate.bat`, I would only need to modify one file. Otherwise, I would need to adjust both. Another approach I thought about was using the `PYTHONSTARTUP` environment variable, but this would require redefining it for each virtual environment, which is not ideal. Ideally, I would like to use an activation/deactivation hook to set `PYTHONSTARTUP`, but this seems to defeat the purpose, as it creates a catch-22 situation.

**Edit:**
My goal is to use the virtual environment for interactive development sessions. I will manually call `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` from the terminal. I do not want to rely on loose Batch or PowerShell scripts that I need to remember to run every time I activate or deactivate the environment. Instead, I would like to integrate my custom scripting hooks into the activation process, so that I can simply execute `activate.bat` and start working without needing to recall the specific steps six months later.

**Solution:**

Many of these issues can be mitigated or resolved by using `virtualenvwrapper-win`. This well-written framework provides simple entry points for managing virtual environments. It has been a significant help in setting up a functional Python development environment on Windows, and I wish I had known about it earlier.

While `virtualenvwrapper-win` does not handle multiple Python installations or switching between them exceptionally well, the project owner has developed a complementary tool called `pywin` to address this shortcoming. 

Overall, `virtualenvwrapper-win` makes command-line development on Windows much smoother, even if it doesn't provide all the automation I might dream of.
