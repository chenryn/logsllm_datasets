### Services and Interfaces for Software Agents and Programs

Software agents and programs often require services that are accessible through web service interfaces. Swoogle, a specialized search engine, enables users to discover Semantic Web documents that utilize specific properties or classes.

### Conclusion

Currently, Google is not well-suited for searching Semantic Web Documents because it expects unstructured text. This limitation means that Google cannot effectively leverage the structured nature of the Semantic Web. Therefore, there is a significant need for powerful search and indexing systems tailored to the Semantic Web, which can help researchers find and analyze these documents more effectively.

Swoogle is a prototype crawler-based indexing and retrieval system designed specifically for Semantic Web Documents, such as those written in RDF or OWL. It employs multiple crawlers to discover these documents through meta-search and link following. Swoogle analyzes the documents, generates metadata, and computes their ranks. One of the key metrics computed is the document's rank, which measures its importance within the Semantic Web. The current version of Swoogle has indexed and analyzed over 11,000 semantic web documents. A second version is under development, which will capture more detailed metadata on classes and properties and is designed to handle millions of documents.

**An Over-Arching Description for the Semantic Web Technologies Column**

For SIGSEMIS: Semantic Web and Information Systems
http://www.sigsemis.org/columns/technologiesColumn/

In this bi-monthly column, I plan to cover various advanced technologies relevant to the field of semantic web technologies. The topics include but are not limited to:

- Knowledge Management techniques
- Advanced Knowledge technologies
- Grid Computing technologies, especially Semantic Grid technologies
- Enterprise Modelling and its applications in assisting the development of semantic web and knowledge management
- Verification and validation techniques applicable to semantic web/rich technologies
- Collaborative systems and their cooperative operations based on semantic web/rich technologies
- Workflow systems that understand, manipulate, and execute semantics-rich information
- Web services and overarching architectures that integrate different web services
- Advancements in process modelling and workflow technologies, especially their relation to the semantic web
- Applications based on advanced semantic web/rich technologies, e.g., advancements in bio-informatics
- Development and applications of ontology technologies, e.g., mapping, evolution, negotiation, and the use of ontologies
- Advanced information technologies, e.g., information extraction, knowledge capture, natural language generation/presentation based on information captured using IE, etc.
- Knowledge portal applications
- Evaluation and critique of current semantic web/rich technologies and their applications
- Combinations of some of the above technologies

While some columns will be entirely my own contributions, guest authors may be invited to provide additional expertise and broaden the column's perspective. Their names may appear as co-authors when appropriate. However, the overall responsibility for the column remains with me.

#### 1. Introduction

Modern organizations are virtual entities composed of heterogeneous resources spanning various geographical locations. Employees in such organizations often work in different places but need to collaborate to achieve common goals. Specialized expertise and tools are deployed as part of daily work, necessitating automatic methods to connect distributed knowledge and streamline workflows. Workflow systems are a prominent solution, but they face several challenges during development and deployment:

- **Gap between design and implementation:** Cross-organizational processes are often sketched out at the design phase, involving process modeling consultants, business personnel, and software engineers. Misinterpretations and errors can occur during the transition from design to implementation.
- **Gap between design and deployment:** Once a workflow system is in place, organizational demands may change, leading to modifications in work practices. While modifying the software directly can be time-saving, it can lead to long-term issues if changes are frequent and undocumented.
- **Adaptation to new technologies:** Businesses today are more technically aware and adopt new tools frequently. New systems often come with their own work practices and computational methods, which may conflict with existing systems. Ensuring compatibility and resolving conflicts is crucial, especially when legacy systems are still in use.

Semantic Web technologies offer a promising solution for interoperability by providing a neutral, semantic-based communication medium. When combined with business process model-based workflow management (BPM-WM), semantic-based BPM-WM enhances the transparency and understanding of information content, improving the quality and maintainability of workflow systems.

#### 2. A Semantic-based Business Process Modelling Language (FBPML)

FBPML integrates two recognized process modeling standards: IDEF3 and NIST PSL. IDEF3 provides comprehensive visual notations and modeling methods but lacks formal semantics, while NIST PSL offers formal semantics and temporal reasoning. FBPML combines these by adapting IDEF3’s visual and modeling methods and mapping them to NIST PSL’s formal semantics. FBPML includes a formal data language, FBPML-DL, for standard data descriptions, and its models can be automatically executed through a workflow meta-interpreter, closing the gap between design and implementation and allowing for easier modifications.

#### 3. Conceptual Overview of Workflow Framework

Figure 1 illustrates a conceptual architecture for a virtual organization where collaborative problem-solving is facilitated by a semantic-based workflow framework. Two departments, Sales and Technical, provide on-demand, customer-tailored computer configurations. The framework uses I-X process panels, FBPML, and the KRAFT constraint solver. FBPML models are translated and managed through I-X, and the KRAFT system is integrated via ontological mappings, enabling smooth collaboration.

#### 4. An Agent-based Communication Architecture

Figure 1 also shows a client-server architecture for interaction between workflow and constraint-solving systems. I-X agents send constraint problems to KRAFT, which solves them and sends back answers. This architecture supports more complex, argumentative communication, allowing the systems to exchange messages, constraints, and partial solutions. The system handles partial knowledge sharing by passing only necessary information and encapsulating domain-specific processes.

#### 5. Conclusion

The vision of the Semantic Web is to enable free sharing of knowledge and automated task execution. Semantic-based workflow technologies support this vision by using rich, semantic descriptions and integrating specialized knowledge-rich agents. We have presented an example of combining FBPML, I-X, and KRAFT to demonstrate how these technologies can enhance collaboration in a virtual organization.
