to the Coconut authorities through its long-term public key.
The authorities establish reputability of volunteers (identiﬁed
by their public keys) through an out of band mechanism. The
user U wants to ﬁnd proxy IP addresses belonging to reputable
volunteers, but volunteers want to hide their identity. As shown
(cid:101)H(s) = gs | s ∈ Fp.

Fig. 6: The censorship-resistant proxy distribution system.
in Figure 6, V gets an ephemeral public key pk(cid:48) from the
proxy (), provides proof of identity to the authorities (),
and gets a credential on two private attributes: the proxy IP
address, pk(cid:48), and the time period δ for which it is valid ().
V shares the credential with the concerned proxy (),
which creates the proxy info including pk(cid:48), δ, and the creden-
tial; the proxy ‘registers’ itself by appending this information
to the blockchain along with a zero-knowledge proof and the
material necessary to verify the validity of the credential ().
The users U monitor the blockchain for proxy registrations.
When a registration is found, U indicates the intent to use a
proxy by publishing to the blockchain a request info message
which looks as follows: user IP address encrypted under pk(cid:48)
which is embedded in the registration blockchain entry ().
The proxy continuously monitors the blockchain, and upon
ﬁnding a user request addressed to itself, connects to U and
presents proof of knowledge of the private key associated with
pk(cid:48) (). U veriﬁes the proof, the proxy IP address and its
validity period, and then starts relaying its trafﬁc through the
proxy.
Security consideration. A common limitation of censorship
resistance schemes is relying on volunteers that are assumed
to be resistant to coercion: either (i) the volunteer is a large,
commercial organisation (e.g., Amazon or Google) over which
the censor cannot exert its inﬂuence; and/or (ii) the volunteer is
located outside the country of censorship. However, both these
assumptions were proven wrong [50], [49]. The proposed CRS
overcomes this limitation by offering coercion-resistance to
