> This really isn't Ideal to compare your solutions
Actually, from a learner's perspective, being able to compare their own
solution against the ideal solution is absolutely ideal. In fact, **"If
feedback is not appropriate (either from an instructor or from self-reference
to an information source), then the practice tends to be ineffective or even
detrimental to learning."** [1]. It isn't about competition with others, but
self-reflection.
One of the biggest challenges becomes identifying "the ideal solution". But
interestingly, reviewing peers' work can be, _in and of itself_ , an effective
pedagogical method if certain conditions are met [2, 3, 4], and FCC is a
poster-child for these conditions!
The current approach means:
  * Having to go search for feedback (e.g. go look it up on the wiki), which means many learners simply won't get that feedback.
  * Lack of comparison between alternative answers (e.g. comparing and rating multiple working solutions) means learners aren't exposed to other solution paradigms, and therefore aren't developing _relevant_ critical thinking skills.
And to be very clear, providing alternative solutions _does not necessitate
competition_. Reviewing multiple alternative solutions (including non-optimal
solutions), and comparing peers' ratings of solutions, is the goal. There is
no need for names, affiliations, or anything else that breeds competition with
anyone else. However, it should encourage self-reflection.

>
>   1. When learners are at a similar skill level.
>   2. When assignments are low stakes [i.e. when a course is taken for
> professional development of personal interest as was the Digital Cultures

>   3. Where credit is not granted.
>   4. When learners are mature, self-directed and motivated.
>   5. When learners have experience in learning and navigating within a

> setting].
>   6. Learners have a developed set of communication skills.
