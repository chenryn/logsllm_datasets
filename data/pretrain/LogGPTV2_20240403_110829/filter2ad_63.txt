1. MOTIVATION
Cloud computing is recognized as the next generation in-
frastructure that would revolutionize the way users access
services [3]. The driving force behind the concept of cloud
computing has been fueled by the growth of computing de-
vices (in particular mobile devices) as well as rich services
which execute on power and memory constrained devices.
The vision of cloud computing will enable users to oﬄoad
these services into high powered storage facilities, where
users will be able to access infrastructures, platforms, as
well as software within the cloud. In essence, the cloud will
represent a network of high powered data centers [2] that
provides a multitude of services to end users based on a pay
as you go model (Figure 1). Although the cloud will en-
able users to elastically consume resources, this will bring
along new challenges for the underlying infrastructure. One
of these challenges include a dynamic traﬃc pattern in the
underlying network, which will require more scalable, eﬃ-
cient, and adaptive routing algorithms.
In this paper, we
propose a scalable routing algorithm called fast search - Pa-
rameterised Gradient Based Routing (fs-PGBR) that is fully
distributed, scalable and reduces considerable latency du-
ring route discovery. The algorithm is an extension to the
Parameterised Gradient Based Routing (PGBR) [1], which
suﬀers from scalability performance once the network topo-
logy size increases.

2. PROPOSED SOLUTION
2.1 PGBR
The original PGBR algorithm is a bio-inspired algorithm
that is inspired from the bacteria motility process known
as chemotaxis. The process of chemotaxis, enables bacteria
to mobilize itself towards a destination by sniﬃng through
an attractant gradient ﬁeld formed in the environment. Mi-
micking this process, the PGBR algorithm generates an in-
creasing chemical gradient ﬁeld that attracts packets to a
destination node. The equation for generating the gradient
ﬁeld can be represented as:
G
d
i (j) = αnl(j) + βlli(j) + γh
d
i (j)
(1)
where Gd
i (j) is the gradient value of link i → j for a packet to
destination d, nl(j) represents the node load value of neigh-
bour node j, lli(j) is the load value of the link i → j, hd
i (j)
is the normalised hop count neighbour node j of i for des-
tination d, and α, β and γ are weighting parameters. The
weighting parameters provides an extra feature of service
oriented routing, where diﬀerent weight sets can correspond
to diﬀerent service types.

Figure 2: Performance evaluation of the new metric
tructure, there is a slight shortfall. This shortfall is in the
approach used to calculate hd
i (j), which is not scalable once
the topology reaches a large number of nodes. In particular,
this could be an issue for large-scale cloud infrastructure
supported by a network topology with a high number of
nodes.
2.2 Hop count value for fs-PGBR
In order to counter the scalability problem, we have mo-
diﬁed the hd
i (j) calculation, and this is represented as:
d
i (j) =
h
max(wd
max(wd
i (k)) − wd
i (j)
i (k)) − min(wd
i (k))
, ∀k neighbour of i (3)
i (k)) = min(wd
This modiﬁcation enables each node i to compare the
shortest path weight of its neighbour k and evaluate it against
the maximum and minimum weights of its neighbours. In
the case of max(wd
i (j)
is set to 1. Therefore, the new calculation evaluates its hop
count not from the relational distance of nodes i and j to
the destination d, but rather from the immediate neighbo-
ring nodes, and its relation to shortest path. This leads to a
perturbation based route discovery process that diverts de-
pending on local conditions of neighboring node (e.g. node
or link load).

3. PRELIMINARY EVALUATION
We have evaluated and compared fs-PGBR to the original
PGBR discovery mechanism, where simulations were con-
ducted in our custom developed Java simulator. The simu-
lation evaluated two performance metrics based on a real-
world large scale topology (i.e. Sprintlink network). The
weights that were used to calculate the shortest path were
provided by the Rocketfuel project and the load of each link
were uniformly selected between 0 and 100% (loads are not
symmetric). The simulation scenario generated 100 source-
destination pairs for each hop count distance, ranging from
1 to 7 hops. The simulations were reproduced 100 times
with diﬀerent loads, and source-destination pairs selection.
For each simulation, we varied the value of γ from 0.1 to 1.0,
which is the weighting for hd
i (j) and reﬂects the importance
of this weight with respect to the shortest path approach.
In addition, α and β have similar weights, and set to make
the sum of the three weights equal to 1.
As shown in Figure 2, we evaluated the number of hops
required to successfully reach the destination as well as the
discovered path length ratio (Figure 2 (a) and (b)).
We observed, in Figure 2 (a) and (b) that using the new
i (j) calculation approach leads to minimal discovery time
hd
compared to the original approach, in particular for long
distance sources. This is due to a number of factors, in-
cluding minimal discovery rejection that may result from
Time-To-Live (TTL) expiration. Consequently, the new ex-
tension also enables more diversity in the choice of parame-
ters for fs-PGBR discoveries. Secondly, as shown in Figure
2 (c), the resulting path is maintained under smaller and
more reasonable path length ratio compared to the original
approach. This demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of fs-PGBR
and its suitability towards timely route discovery for cloud
computing infrastructures.
4. CLOUD COMPUTING INTEGRATION
Cloud computing requires fast discovery of services that
are populated in large scale data centre networks. Once dis-
covered, the paths for the services’ must also ensure that
Quality-of-Service (QoS) and Quality-of-Experience (QoE)
requirements are met. fs-PGBR provides individual routing
paths that can adapt to each service’s requirements in a fully
distributed manner, while minimizing the cost of discovery.
In particular, fs-PGBR is ideal for cloud computing infras-
tructure that are built over large network topologies, and
is able to support high service churn rates or varying user
demand.
