Assistant: I understand your question.
You wish to be able to maintain a list of users that have signed up with your service, and also want to record users using OpenID to authenticate.
In order to solve this I would do either of the following:

Create a new user in your users table for each new user logged in under OpenID, and store their OpenID in this table to allow you to join the two.
Move your site to OpenID and change all references to your current users to OpenID users.

I'd probably go with Option 1 if you already have this app in production.
Note: More experienced Open ID users will probably correct me!
