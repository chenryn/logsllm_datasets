### How to Integrate Local Users and OpenID (or Facebook, Twitter) Users

You are looking to integrate local user accounts with those authenticated via OpenID (such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter) into a single user model. This is a common requirement for many web applications, and there are several frameworks and libraries that can help you achieve this.

#### Understanding the Problem
You want to manage both local users (who sign up directly on your platform) and external users (who authenticate via OpenID or social media). The goal is to have a unified user model that can handle both types of authentication seamlessly.

#### Solution Approaches

1. **Create Separate User Types in the Same Table:**
   - **Approach:** Store all users in a single `users` table, but differentiate them by an additional column (e.g., `authentication_type`). For local users, store their username and password. For OpenID users, store their OpenID identifier.
   - **Example Schema:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE users (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         username VARCHAR(255),
         password_hash VARCHAR(255),  -- Only for local users
         openid_identifier VARCHAR(255),  -- Only for OpenID users
         email VARCHAR(255),
         authentication_type ENUM('local', 'openid')
     );
     ```
   - **Pros:** Simplifies querying and management since all users are in one table.
   - **Cons:** Requires careful handling to ensure that the correct fields are used based on the `authentication_type`.

2. **Use a Polymorphic Association:**
   - **Approach:** Use a polymorphic association to link a `user` model to different authentication methods. This involves creating separate tables for each authentication type and a main `users` table.
   - **Example Schema:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE users (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         email VARCHAR(255),
         -- Other common user fields
     );

     CREATE TABLE local_authentications (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         user_id INT,
         username VARCHAR(255),
         password_hash VARCHAR(255),
         FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE openid_authentications (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         user_id INT,
         openid_identifier VARCHAR(255),
         FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
     );
     ```
   - **Pros:** More flexible and scalable, especially if you need to add more authentication methods in the future.
   - **Cons:** Slightly more complex to implement and query.

#### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Django (Python):** Django has built-in support for multiple authentication backends, including local and third-party providers like OpenID. You can use the `django-allauth` package to easily integrate various authentication methods.
  - **Documentation:** [Django Authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/)
  - **Package:** [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth)

- **Ruby on Rails (Ruby):** Rails also supports multiple authentication backends. The `omniauth` gem is commonly used for integrating OpenID and other social logins.
  - **Gem:** [omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth)
  - **Tutorial:** [OmniAuth with Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/OmniAuth:-Overview)

- **Laravel (PHP):** Laravel provides the `Socialite` package for handling OAuth and OpenID Connect integrations.
  - **Package:** [Laravel Socialite](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/socialite)

- **Node.js (JavaScript):** For Node.js applications, you can use the `passport` library, which supports a wide range of authentication strategies.
  - **Library:** [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)

#### Example with Django and `django-allauth`

1. **Install `django-allauth`:**
   ```bash
   pip install django-allauth
   ```

2. **Add `allauth` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'django.contrib.sites',
       'allauth',
       'allauth.account',
       'allauth.socialaccount',
       'allauth.socialaccount.providers.google',
       'allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook',
       'allauth.socialaccount.providers.twitter',
   ]
   ```

3. **Configure `allauth` in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
       'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
       'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
   )

   SITE_ID = 1

   ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True
   ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False
   ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email'
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Set up social apps in the Django admin panel.**

By following these steps, you can create a robust and flexible user model that supports both local and OpenID-based authentication.
