triggered suppression in a six-node pyramid (Table 3), averaging
200 simulation runs. The damp count column indicates the number
of simulation runs in which withdrawal triggered suppression oc-
curred. We notice two main differences in convergence times when
compared to the behavior of the clique: (1) Sender-side loop detec-
tion completely eliminates convergence-based suppression in the
6-node pyramid! We veriﬁed that it actually does so for all other
pyramid sizes for which suppression is invoked in the base case.
(2) Unlike for the clique, withdrawal rate-limiting actually exhibits
lower convergence time than the base case. We explain these dif-
ferences below.

SSLD: SSLD is very effective for the pyramid, because it inval-
idates all alternate routes within a single round of the MRAI timer.
We show such an example for a 4-node pyramid in Table 4. When
node 1 withdraws the route to d, node 2 picks the alternate route
[2  1], but does not propagate it to  because it notices a loop.
Similarly,  picks [ 2 1] and does not propagate this route to 2.
Instead, both node  and node 2 send withdrawals to each other
(in this scenario, withdrawal rate-limiting is not in effect), but an-
nounce their choices to their other neighbors. When  receives
node 2’s withdrawal, however,  withdraws the route [ 2 1] from
all of its neighbors (stage 3 in Table 4). Similarly, node 2 withdraws
from its neighbor 3 (stage 4). As a result, node 3 will withdraw the
route from  after stage 4, so node X never sees enough ﬂaps to
exceed the suppression threshold.
WRATE: Table 3 shows that, unlike for the clique, the WRATE
scenario can actually exhibit a lower convergence time. This is
because when withdrawals are delayed by the MRAI timer, there
are some cases where node  sees fewer secondary ﬂaps compared
to the base case. These cases depend on a particular sequence of
route propagation. Please refer to [13] for an example of one such
sequence. Intuitively, since the number of alternate routes going
through  is much greater than ones that do not, withdrawal rate-
limiting increases the probability of exploring the former routes.

5.3.3 A Sample Topology
We take a sample real topology from the study done by Labovitz et
al. [8] to test whether withdrawal triggered suppression can hap-
pen in real topologies. Table 5 shows the results, each data point
denoting the average of 50 simulation runs. The damp count col-
umn indicates the number of simulation runs in which withdrawal
triggered suppression occurred. Note that the impact of the vari-
ous BGP knobs is consistent with our observations for the clique
topology: setting the MRAI timer to a smaller value increases the
number of messages and convergence times, and withdrawal rate-
limiting worsens the convergence times and increases the number
messages. What is interesting is that for this topology, SSLD and
less aggressive damping both eliminate withdrawal triggered sup-
pression. We found that with SSLD enabled, the number of MRAI
rounds is reduced to one and thus reduces the likelihood of trig-
gering route suppression. Note, SSLD cannot eliminate the pos-
sibility of withdrawal triggered suppression, because the route re-
announcement may cause additional ﬂaps.
5.4 Summary
In summary, our extensive simulations reveal several important
observations about withdrawal triggered suppression: In many topolo-
gies, including at least one real topology fragment, BGP path ex-
plorations following withdrawal can trigger route ﬂap damping af-
ter just a single withdrawal followed by a route re-announcement.
In such cases, the route is sometimes suppressed for up to an hour.
Even in topologies with a large number of alternate paths of dif-
ferent lengths, such as the pyramid, it is not always true that with-
drawal triggered suppression is more likely to be invoked than in
smaller topologies. No proposed or deployed BGP implementation
features eliminate this phenomenon for all topologies. For certain
topologies, e.g., pyramid, sender-side loop detection can eliminate
withdrawal triggered suppression.
6. TRACE ANALYSIS
We have already shown that withdrawal triggered suppression
can happen in practice, by taking a realistic topology fragment
from [8] and from our experiments of Cisco and Juniper routers
in a 4-node clique topology [13]. How prevalent is withdrawal
triggered suppression? This is a difﬁcult question to answer with
certainty. Instead, we get a handle on this question by perform-
ing a simple analysis of BGP update traces to determine how often
we can observe an important signature of delayed convergence—
successive announcements of strictly increasing path lengths. Each
such sequence of length greater than four can potentially trigger
230suppression at a damping-enabled router. For our traces analysis,
we use publicly available routing update data from RIPE NCC [16]
and the University of Oregon Route Views project [17].

Our trace analysis simply counts instances of routing message
sequences with strictly increasing path lengths followed by a with-
drawal, ignoring path length increases caused by AS path prepend-
ing. We only recorded sequences of length four or greater, since
at least four ﬂaps are required to trigger ﬂap damping. Table 6
shows the results of our analysis on a particular day from both
data sources. We ﬁnd several thousand instances of such routing
message sequences in our traces. Notice also that these sequences
are not restricted to a particular peer, nor from a particular pre-
ﬁx, and they span a wide variety of preﬁx lengths. This indicates
that the phenomenon we describe in this paper may actually oc-
cur relatively frequently, and is therefore of considerable practical
importance. As we conjectured earlier, we rarely observed update
sequences indicative of announcement-triggered suppression, i.e.,
routes of decreasing path lengths.
7. SELECTIVE ROUTE FLAP DAMPING
In this section, we consider a simple solution for both withdrawal
and announcement triggered suppression. We should emphasize
that our goal here is to demonstrate the existence of a relatively
simple mechanism that will reduce or eliminate the occurrence of
triggering route suppression during convergence. Much more eval-
uation and experimentation is necessary to understand the efﬁcacy
of the scheme under various topologies, as well as its incremental
deployability. That is the subject of future work.
The key to our mechanism is to detect route changes due to path
exploration to avoid increasing penalties. From the clique exam-
ple in Section 3, one might conclude that one way to detect route
changes due to path exploration is to avoid penalizing successive
routes with non-decreasing path lengths. Thus, if a new route has
the same or longer path length than the existing route, we do not
increment the ﬂap penalty.
While this works for the simple example we discussed above,
it does not work well in general. In particular, policies at various
nodes in the clique can, in theory, cause longer path lengths to be
explored ﬁrst than shorter ones (if they happen to be more pre-
ferred). So, a more general observation might be that each node,
during convergence after withdrawal, selects routes in order of non-
increasing preference until it ﬁnally withdraws the route. Thus, if
the sender of a route includes its current preference for the route (a
feature that BGP currently lacks for external peers), the receiver of
the route can compare the sender’s preference for the received route
with that of the previous route from the sender. The preference
value can be encoded in a specialized community attribute that is
nontransitive, making our proposal incrementally deployable. The
receiver can then increment the penalty for the route if the new
route does not have a higher preference (at the sender) compared to
the previous route.
This simple mechanism does not work perfectly. The sequence
of route changes seen from a peer during withdrawal convergence
can have route withdrawals interspersed with routing updates.17
Furthermore, in some topologies such as the pyramid, this can hap-
pen even without SSLD (see [13] for an example). Thus, our mech-
anism has to deal with this situation as well.
Our proposed mechanism is a modiﬁcation to route ﬂap damp-
ing that we call selective route ﬂap damping. It requires the sender
to attach to each route announcement its local preference or the
relative preference value compared to the previous route announce-
ment. We keep two bits for each destination route from each peer.
These two bits encode the comparative value of the last two an-
nouncements received. We call these two bits the comparison bits.
00 denotes the situation where fewer than two routes have been re-
ceived. 01 denotes that the values of the two routes are the same.
10 means the latest route has higher degrees of preference than its
previous route. And ﬁnally, 11 indicates the latest route is less pre-
ferred. When an announcement is received, comparison bits are
recomputed based on the current announcement and the latest an-
nouncement. The newly computed comparison bits are compared
with the stored comparison bits. If these two sets of comparison bits
indicate that the direction of route preference change has altered,
then we count the current announcement as a ﬂap. In other words,
if one set of comparison bits is 10 and the other is 11, we consider
the announcement received as a ﬂap. This heuristic is used, be-
cause secondary ﬂaps are always of either increasing or decreasing
degrees of preference.
To deal with interleaved withdrawals, selective damping tem-
porarily ignores withdrawal messages until the next announcement
is received. We keep track of the temporary penalty corresponding
to the withdrawal message and let it decay exponentially just like
the regular penalty value. This temporary penalty would have been
added to the penalty in the existing scheme. If the next announce-
ment received is considered a ﬂap, this temporary penalty is added
to the penalty value in addition to the penalty corresponding to the
current ﬂap. Otherwise, the temporary penalty is discarded. Here
we add another condition under which the current route is consid-
ered a ﬂap.
If the route received has the same preference value
as the previous one, we do not simply discard it as a redundant
update, because the announcements could be interleaved by with-
drawals. Thus, we count the current announcement as a ﬂap if it
has the same value as the previous announcement and is preceded
by a withdrawal. The goal of this slight modiﬁcation is to make
sure the new scheme can contain real ﬂaps.
Selective damping is thus designed to ignore route changes caused
by withdrawal exploration, yet to mimic unmodiﬁed route ﬂap damp-
ing. It does so, but with one caveat. Because of the way it deals with
withdrawals, it penalizes true route ﬂaps to the same extent that
unmodiﬁed route ﬂap damping would, but it might do so slightly
