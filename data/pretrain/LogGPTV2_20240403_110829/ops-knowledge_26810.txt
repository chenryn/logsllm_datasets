User: I get this warning while running a python program (some basic web automation using selenium):

warning: Debugger speedups using cython not found. Run
  '"/usr/bin/python3.5"
  "/root/.p2/pool/plugins/org.python.pydev_4.5.5.201603221110/pysrc/setup_cython.py"
  build_ext --inplace' to build. pydev debugger: starting (pid: 3502)

How can I address this issue?
Assistant: This is as expected. Run"/usr/bin/python3.5" "/root/.p2/pool/plugins/org.python.pydev_4.5.5.201603221110/pysrc/setup_cython.py" build_ext --inplace as it asks to get the debugger accelerations.
(Nb. The error in the comment below was because this answer was missing an initial double quote.)
Ideally run it from within your virtual environment, if you use one, to make sure you run this for the correct Python version. You'll need to run this once per Python version you use.
