cial overlay network among users to disintegrate into multi-
ple disconnected components. As a consequence, two nodes
that are online at the same time may not be able to com-
municate with each other due to them being present in two
distinct connected components and thus no path exists be-
tween them.
In essence, high unavailability degrades the
network connectivity which is critical to our system.
The authors [28] explore nodes that are beyond the imme-
diate trust circle of each node by tapping into the potential
of the 2-hop neighborhood of the node:
the neighbors of
its immediate neighbors. The idea is that trust is usually
transitive, i.e., friends of friends are often considered trust-
worthy albeit to a lesser extent. Their experiments reveal
that leveraging all the 2-hop neighbors of each node signiﬁ-
cantly improves the network connectivity even in the case of
high unavailability. In other words, a much larger fraction
of all online honest nodes belong to the largest connected
component (LCC) with the Two-Hop overlay in comparison
to that of the simplistic One-Hop overlay.
MCON [28], however, cannot be applied to our system di-
rectly due to the following reasons. First, MCON employs
a central authority that limits the number of Sybil identi-
ties, and controls the degree of each node to an extent in
the system. In contrast, our system aims for a decentral-
ized design where Sybil identities and node degree are not
restricted. Second, our analysis in Sec. 5.3 and the experi-
mental results in Sec. 6 validate our hypothesis that
Adding links from each node to all its 2-hop neigh-
bors has a signiﬁcant unintended consequence of
creating a large number of new (2-hop) attack
edges between honest and Sybil nodes.
This is particularly undesired since the robustness of SNSD
schemes relies on the attack edges being few and limited.
An Illustrating Example. Consider the following system
comprising an honest region and a Sybil region. The honest
region’s graph structure follows the Barab´asi-Albert prefer-
ential attachment model [9] with n = 500 honest nodes and
d = 4 average node degree. The Sybil region mimics the hon-
est region with the same model and the number of nodes but
with an average Sybil degree dS = d∗5 = 20. The honest and
Sybil regions are connected by g = 0.05 ∗ n (1-hop) attack
edges. This constitutes the initial overlay of the system,
as depicted in Figure 1(a). When only 20% of all honest
users are online (i.e., unavailability c = 0.8), the One-Hop
overlay disintegrates into multiple disconnected components
(Fig. 1(b)). Adding (2-hop) links from each honest node to
all its 2-hop neighbors results in the Two-Hop overlay with
better network connectivity, but comes at a signiﬁcant cost
of the creation of many new 2-hop attack edges (Fig. 1(c)).
5.2 Selective k 2-hop neighbors
The design space for our system, with the constraints of
high unavailability and strategic Sybil attack, can thus be
populated with two points: (i) One-Hop overlay with poor
network connectivity and fair attack resilience (Fig. 1(b)),
and (ii) Two-Hop overlay with fair network connectivity and
poor attack resilience (Fig. 1(c)).
In this paper, we pro-
pose a new design point in the trade-oﬀ between network
connectivity and attack resilience (Fig. 1(d)).
Our approach aims to add links from each node v to only
a selective few (k) of all its 2-hop neighbors. The criteria for
the selection of a v’s 2-hop neighbor y ∈ N2({v}) is based on
our adaptation of the expansion contribution [20] of y with
respect to v, which is calculated as:
f (v, y) = |N ({y})| − |N ({v}) ∩ N ({y})|

Expansion contribution captures the number of new neigh-
