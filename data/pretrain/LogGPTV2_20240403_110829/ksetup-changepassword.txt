### ksetup /changepassword

**Description:**
The `ksetup /changepassword` command uses the Key Distribution Center (KDC) password (kpasswd) value to change the password of the currently logged-on user. The command output will indicate whether the password change was successful or if it failed.

**Checking kpasswd:**
To determine if the kpasswd is set, you can run the `ksetup /dumpstate` command and review the output.

**Syntax:**
```
ksetup /changepassword
```

**Parameters:**
- **Old Password:** Specifies the current password of the logged-on user.
- **New Password:** Specifies the new password for the logged-on user. This password must meet all the password requirements set on the computer.

**Remarks:**
- If the user account is not found in the current domain, the system will prompt you to provide the domain name where the user account resides.
- To force a password change at the next logon, you can use an asterisk (*) as the new password, which will prompt the user to enter a new password during the next logon.

**Examples:**
1. **Change the password of the currently logged-on user in the current domain:**
   ```
   ksetup /changepassword OldPassword NewPassword
   ```

2. **Change the password of the currently logged-on user in the Contoso domain:**
   ```
   ksetup /domain CONTOSO /changepassword OldPassword NewPassword
   ```

3. **Force the currently logged-on user to change the password at the next logon:**
   ```
   ksetup /changepassword OldPassword *
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and update user passwords using the `ksetup /changepassword` command.
