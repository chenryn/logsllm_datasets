User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: i had same issue and did a pip upgrade using following and now it works fine.
 python -m pip install --upgrade pip
