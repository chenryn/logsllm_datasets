### Feature request
Whisper speech recognition without conditioning on previous text.  
As in
https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/7858aa9c08d98f75575035ecd6481f462d66ca27/whisper/transcribe.py#L278
### Motivation
Whisper implementation is great however conditioning the decoding on previous
text can cause significant hallucination and repetitive text, e.g.:
> "Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice?
> Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice?
> Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice?
> Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice?
> Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice? Do you have malpractice?
> Do you have malpractice?"
Running openai's model with `--condition_on_previous_text False` drastically
reduces hallucination
