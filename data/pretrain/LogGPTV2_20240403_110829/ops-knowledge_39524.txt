[0.0,84.6,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,70.6,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,51.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,55.6,93.7,0]
Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Unable to determine
B: Sparse
C: Stationary
D: Periodic

Assistant: Answer: B
