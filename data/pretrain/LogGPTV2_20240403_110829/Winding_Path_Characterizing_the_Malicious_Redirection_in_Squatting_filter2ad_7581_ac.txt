### Proportions of 'o-script' and 'i-script'

Our analysis reveals that the JavaScript-based method accounts for 35.3% of the total instances. Furthermore, adversaries tend to import redirection snippets from external files (referred to as 'o-script') rather than hard-coding them directly into the HTML content (referred to as 'i-script'). This approach allows adversaries to evade static HTML content analysis by security personnel to some extent.

### 4.2 Intermediary Sharing

In the previous section, we noted that some malicious samples ultimately point to the same URL, indicating that they start at different points but converge at the same destination. For example, an adversary may manage multiple squatting domain names and direct visitors to a single illegal gambling site. This observation led us to hypothesize that certain samples not only share the same destination but also use the same intermediary nodes. To test this hypothesis, we aggregated all redirection chains in malicious samples to identify common relay nodes.

**Table 6. Measurements of Commonly Used URLs, Domain Names, and Effective 2LDs in Malicious Redirection Chains.**

| Total | Commonly Used | Involved Samples |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| #     | %             | #                | %                 |
| URL   | 72,538        | 4,117            | 5.68%             | 15,593           | 57.48%          |
| Domain Name | 40,525       | 3,634            | 8.97%             | 16,899           | 62.29%          |
| Effective 2LD | 33,532      | 3,558            | 10.61%            | 17,060           | 62.89%          |

First, we measured the URLs that appeared in multiple redirection chains, performing exact matches including complete parameters and fragments. The second row of Table 6 shows that out of 72,538 distinct URLs, 4,117 URLs appeared in at least two redirection chains, accounting for 5.68% of the total. These commonly used URLs were involved in 15,593 malicious samples, indicating that 57.48% of the malicious squatting domain names share business relationships, which is a significant proportion.

Next, we examined the commonly used domain names in malicious redirections. Compared to URLs, domain names have higher coverage because we do not need to match various URL parameters and fragments. We also ignored the port field when extracting domain names. The third row of Table 6 lists the results: 40,525 distinct domain names were identified, with 3,634 domain names appearing in more than one sample, accounting for 8.97% of the total. Additionally, 62.29% of the malicious samples shared these intermediary domain names.

During our measurements, we found that some relay nodes with different domain names only differed in their subdomain names, meaning they had the same effective 2LD (e2LD). Further investigation at the e2LD level revealed that 10.61% of e2LDs appeared in multiple malicious redirection chains. However, the coverage of commonly used e2LDs did not increase significantly compared to domain names, with only 161 more involved samples.

### 4.3 Infrastructure Sharing

This section focuses on the Internet infrastructures supporting these intermediary domain names. We will discuss the abuse of Internet infrastructures by malicious redirections from the bottom up, considering IP addresses, BGP prefixes, and AS numbers.

We previously introduced the sharing of e2LDs in malicious redirections. Here, we matched the associated IP addresses of those 33,532 e2LDs from a built pDNS database, yielding 27,396 distinct IP addresses. This indicates that many e2LDs resolve to the same IP address. The second row of Table 7 shows that 8.38% of these IP addresses support the resolution of multiple malicious intermediaries, and 41.93% of the malicious samples involve the sharing of IP addresses during their redirections.

**Table 7. Measurements of Commonly Used IP Addresses, BGP Prefixes, and ASes in Malicious Redirection Chains.**

| Total | Commonly Used | Involved Samples |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| #     | %             | #                | %                 |
| IP    | 27,396        | 2,296            | 8.38%             | 11,375           | 41.93%          |
| BGP   | 8,932         | 4,817            | 53.93%            | 25,104           | 92.54%          |
| AS    | 754           | 424              | 56.23%            | 26,608           | 98.08%          |

Using the matched IP addresses, we then focused on their BGP prefixes. We used a third-party Python extension module called 'pyasn' [9] to look up the BGP prefix of an IP address based on a daily updated public BGP archive [6]. We found a total of 8,932 BGP prefixes, with 4,817 abused by at least two malicious intermediaries. These BGP prefixes provided resolution services for 92.54% of the malicious squatting domain names, either directly or indirectly. Additionally, 'pyasn' provides the lookup of AS numbers, allowing us to measure the ASes that own the abused BGP prefixes. The fourth row of Table 7 shows that the 8,932 BGP prefixes are aggregated into 754 ASes, with 424 ASes exploited by more than one malicious intermediary, accounting for 56.23% of the total. Importantly, 98.08% of the malicious samples involved the abuse of these 424 ASes during their redirections.

These measurements highlight the crucial role of Internet infrastructure in malicious redirection activities. Adversaries often choose ISPs with weaker Internet supervision, leading to the concentration of most malicious intermediary domain names within the same Internet infrastructure.

### 5. Limitation

This paper focuses on malicious redirections stemming from squatting domain names, but the types of domains employing such malicious services in the wild are far more varied. Additionally, we only considered domain rankings when selecting target brands, missing some hot terms, making our generated squatting domain names somewhat outdated. For instance, a large number of pandemic-related squatting domain names emerged in early 2020. Besides infrastructure sharing, we found that many malicious domain names also exhibit significant aggregation in requested web resources. Leveraging this sharing phenomenon, we can identify more suspicious domain names. Furthermore, we have not delved deeply into the specific working mechanisms of malicious redirections, especially the JavaScript-based method. Our measurements were conducted in the Chinese network environment, limiting our understanding of abusive URL redirections in other regions. Addressing these issues is crucial for understanding the target victims, working mechanisms, and monetization of malicious redirections, and we will address them in future work.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive insight into malicious redirections starting with squatting domain names. By crawling these domain names and analyzing their performance logs, we identified 20,079 squatting domain names that use URL redirection to lead visitors to malicious sites. Our investigation of the corresponding redirection chains shows that adversaries prefer to perform malicious redirections via imported JavaScript codes or iframes. More importantly, our further measurements reveal a very common phenomenon of resource sharing among various malicious redirection chains.
