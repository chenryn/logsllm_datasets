User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Adding tail behaviour where enter adds blank lines to less I love less, which I can use to follow logs with the +F flag (or the ShiftF hotkey), search forwards and backwards, and generally move freely through the document.

But there is one thing missing in less: usually I am at the end of the file, and I want to see new things happening. In tail -f I would just hit enter several times, and new log lines would just appear clearly separated from old lines.

Is it possible to add this to less? How?

Assistant: This isn't really tail's behavior -- it's the terminal. Tail is just sending a stream of output to stdout, which goes to your terminal, and you're inserting blank lines in the middle of that output by hitting enter. Tail itself isn't actually accepting input from you at all. You can type whatever else you want and that will show up too.

less, however, is a console app, and it takes input and processes it. It's managing the console using terminal control sequences, which is how you can scroll around. Letting you insert arbitrary characters into the stream would mess up the display, and anyway less uses your input to control the program.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have a way to mark the current position visually. That's not a terrible feature request, though, and less does still get new features from time to time.
