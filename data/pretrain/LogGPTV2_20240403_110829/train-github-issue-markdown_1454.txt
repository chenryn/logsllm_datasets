## Steps to Reproduce
I am attempting to compile a Flutter application that utilizes `FlutterViewController` for an iPhone 5 (ARM 32-bit architecture).

## Logs
When running the application using `flutter run`, the following log output is generated:

```bash
pawelurban@MacBook-Pro-4 ~/w/Flutter-Demo> ../flutter/bin/flutter run  
Launching lib/main.dart on iPhone (Test) in debug mode...
2017-02-07 13:31:00.989 ios-deploy[84260:11111874] [ !! ] Error 0xe8000087: This application does not support this device's CPU type. AMDeviceSecureInstallApplication(0, device, url, options, install_callback, 0)
Could not install build/ios/Release-iphoneos/Runner.app on 116fe6f14b81cb490ebab9c2f150d45810a740ed.
Try launching Xcode and selecting "Product > Run" to fix the problem:
  open ios/Runner.xcodeproj
Error launching application on iPhone (Test).
```

## Flutter Doctor Output
The `flutter doctor` command yields the following results:

```bash
