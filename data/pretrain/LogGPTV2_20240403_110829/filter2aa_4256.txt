## Repeating XOR (Crypto, 400 points)

Upon entering the luxurious condominium, you immediately sense that you are in the home of a former star. The extravagant flooring and furnishings showcase the opulence of this celebrity. But where is she? There she is, lying peacefully on her couch. It's evident what envy has done to her: despite her well-maintained, attractive body, her face is beyond recognition. Identifying her is crucial to uncovering who killed her and why. In the absence of any personal data, the only clue is a file containing cryptic text. You are fairly certain that she used her own name as the key for an XOR encryption. Your challenge is to determine her name.
