# Message Delivery and Latency Analysis in Static and Mobile Networks

## Figures 7 and 8: Latency to Deliver a Message to X% of Nodes
- **Figure 7**: Latency to deliver a message to X% of the nodes when all nodes are static (with 200 nodes and sending one message per second).
- **Figure 8**: Latency to deliver a message to X% of the nodes when nodes are mobile (with 200 nodes and sending one message per second).

### Recovery Mechanism
- We limited the number of times each message is gossiped to two. Additional gossip attempts slightly improve delivery ratios but at the cost of additional messages.
- The main Byzantine behavior checked was being mute, as it has the most adverse effect on system performance.

### Simulation Results for Static Networks
- **Figures 5, 6, and 7** present the results of simulations in static networks with no Byzantine nodes.
- In this benign case, all protocols achieve very high delivery rates, with latencies well below 20ms.
- However, the flooding protocol's network load grows dramatically with the number of neighbors each node has, making it less energy-efficient and scalable compared to other protocols.
- Despite the staggering used, the flooding approach resulted in a relatively small number of collisions, which were compensated for by its high redundancy, explaining its high delivery ratios.
- With higher sending rates, the flooding protocol is expected to perform much worse.

### Comparison of Protocols in Static Networks
- **MIS+B** and **CDS** performed almost identically, but MIS+B is more computationally efficient. Therefore, we only present the results for the MIS+B overlay in the rest of the work.

### Simulation Results for Mobile Networks
- **Figures 9, 10, and 8** present the simulation results for a mobile network.
- Flooding continues to perform well in terms of delivery ratio and latency but poorly in terms of network load.
- A significant difference is observed between our dissemination protocol (BDP) and a simple dissemination without gossip and recovery (OVERLAY).
- BDP maintains delivery rates close to flooding (and close to 100%), while OVERLAY's delivery rate drops to 40%.
- Generally, all protocols deliver messages quickly, but OVERLAY only delivers messages to about 40% of the nodes.
- In BDP, the latency slightly increases for the last nodes proportionally to the frequency of a single gossip exchange.

### Impact of Byzantine Nodes
- **Figures 11 and 12** explore the delivery ratio of different protocols with varying numbers of Byzantine nodes.
- Without a recovery mechanism, the delivery rate drops dramatically.
- Both BDP and the flooding protocol maintain very high delivery rates.
- Interestingly, the impact of Byzantine nodes is weakened when nodes are mobile, as the overlay adapts to the evolving network topology, reducing the influence of Byzantine nodes.

### Network Load Analysis
- **Figures 13 and 14** explore the network load imposed by different protocols as a function of the number of Byzantine nodes.
- In the static case, the network load imposed by BDP increases linearly with the number of Byzantine nodes, while the load imposed by flooding slightly improves.
- In the dynamic case, mobility improves the asymptotic behavior of the protocols, as the overlay structure evolves with the network topology, making it harder for Byzantine nodes to block message dissemination.

### Latency Analysis with Byzantine Nodes
- **Figures 15 and 16** explore the latency to deliver a message to X% of the nodes when some nodes are Byzantine (out of 200 nodes and a sending rate of 1 message per second).
- The latency grows with the number of Byzantine nodes.
- In the static Byzantine case, almost all nodes receive the message in less than a second, but it may take several seconds to deliver a message to the last 20% of the nodes if there are many Byzantine nodes.
- In the mobile case, the latency starts growing beyond one second at 60% of the nodes.
- Fine-tuning the rate of gossips and other timers can reduce the quantitative latency numbers, but without a best-effort recovery mechanism, reliable delivery is almost impossible due to the potential collusion of Byzantine nodes to block messages.

## Related Work
- A survey of broadcast and multicast protocols for wireless ad hoc networks can be found in [46].
- Routing in MANETs can be classified into proactive (e.g., OLSR [13]), reactive (e.g., AODV [40] and DSR [28]), and hybrid (e.g., ZRP [26]) approaches, as well as geographic routing [29, 30, 31, 41]. These protocols, however, do not account for Byzantine failures.
- Spanning tree-based overlays have been commonly used for message dissemination, but they also do not address Byzantine failures.
