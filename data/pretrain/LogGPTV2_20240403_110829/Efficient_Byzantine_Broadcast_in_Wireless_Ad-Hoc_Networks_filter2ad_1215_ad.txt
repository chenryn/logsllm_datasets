recovery. We limited the number of times each message is gossiped to two. Additional gossip attempts
slightly improve the delivery ratios, but at the cost of additional messages. Finally, the main Byzantine
behavior checked was of being mute, as this has the most adverse affect on the performance of the system.
The results of the simulations in static networks with no Byzantine nodes are presented in Figures 5, 6,
and 7. As can be seen by the graphs, in this benign case, all protocols obtain very high delivery rate.
Essentially, in all protocols the latency to deliver a message to all nodes remain well below 20ms. However,
the load on the network of the ﬂooding protocol grows dramatically in the number of neighbors each node
has (or in other words, the density of the network). Thus, from an energy stand point, ﬂooding is much
worse and less scalable than the others. Due to the staggering we used, even the ﬂooding approach resulted
in a relatively small number of collisions that were compensated for by its high redundancy, which explains
its high delivery ratios. However, with higher sending rates, it is expected to perform much worse.
Since MIS+B and CDS performed almost the same, yet MIS+B is much more computationally efﬁcient,
during the rest of the this work, we only present the results for the MIS+B overlay. Figures 9, 10, and 8
present the simulation results for a mobile network. Here, ﬂooding continues to behave well in terms
of delivery ratio and latency (and bad in terms of network load). However, we start seeing a signiﬁcant
difference between our dissemination protocol (BDP) and a simple dissemination with no gossip and no
recovery of messages (OVERLAY). While BDP maintains delivery rates close to ﬂooding (and close to
100%), without gossip the delivery rate drops to 40%. Generally speaking, all protocols deliver messages
fast. However, OVERLAY only delivers message to about 40% of the nodes. Also, in BDP the latency
slightly grows for the last nodes proportionally to the frequency of a single gossip exchange.
Figures 11 and 12 explore the delivery ratio of the different protocols with varying number of Byzantine
nodes. As can be seen, when no recovery mechanism is employed, the delivery rate drops dramatically. On
the other hand, both our protocol and the ﬂooding protocol maintain very high delivery rates. Interestingly,
when nodes are mobile, the impact of Byzantine nodes is weakened. This can be explained by the fact that
the overlay adapts itself to the evolving network topology. Thus, a Byzantine node does not necessarily
remain in the overlay throughout the execution.
Figures 13 and 14 explore the network load imposed by the different protocols as a function of the

number of Byzantine nodes. In the static case, the network load imposed by BDP exhibit a linear increase
with the number of Byzantine nodes. On the other hand, the network load imposed by ﬂooding slightly
improves. This can be explained by the fact that if Byzantine nodes avoid sending messages, then fewer
messages are sent. As for the dynamic case, here we also observe the interesting phenomena that mobility
improves the asymptotic behavior of the protocols. Again, this can be explained by the fact that the overlay
structure evolves with the network topology, making it “harder” for Byzantine nodes to block message
dissemination along the overlay.
Figures 15 and 16 explore the latency to deliver a message to X% of the nodes when some nodes are
Byzantine (out of 200 nodes and a sending rate of 1 message per second). Clearly, the latency grows with
the number of Byzantine nodes. Also, in the static Byzantine case, almost all nodes receive the message in
less than a second and only when there are many Byzantine nodes, it may take several seconds to deliver a
message to the last 20% of the nodes. In the mobile case we see the same qualitative behavior, but the latency
starts growing beyond one second at 60% of the nodes. We would like to point out that by ﬁne tuning the rate
of gossips and the other timers in the system, it is possible to dramatically reduce the quantitative latency
numbers. The numbers here do not include such tuning, yet we started exploring this option. However,
the important thing to note is that with Byzantine nodes, without a best-effort recovery mechanism, it is
almost impossible to ensure reliable delivery just by retransmission. This is because without additional
recovery mechanism, the Byzantine nodes might collude to block all messages from reaching some parts of
the network.

A good survey of broadcast and multicast protocols for wireless ad hoc networks can be found in [46]. In
particular, (multicast) routing in MANET can be classiﬁed into proactive, e.g., OLSR [13], reactive, e.g.,
AODV [40] and DSR [28], and mixtures of both, e.g., ZRP [26], as well as geographic routing [29, 30, 31,
41]. These protocols, however, ignore Byzantine failures.
