This robust solution combines the features of many resources within this chapter into one search. It relies on 
the Twitter API, so it will only analyze the most recent 3,200 Tweets. WTiilc searching my own account, I 
received a summaiy which included the following. Investigative benefits are next to each.

This page displays several changes I made to my account on 9/8/16, including changing my name and location. 
Searching more active people will usually reveal many pages of changes, and will always display die previous 
content as stricken, and highlight any changes in green. I do not recommend creating an account to use this 
service, it will demand access to the people you follow, which could jeopardize your investigation. z\n alternative 
to this sen ice is SearchMyBio (scarchmy.bio).
Real World Application: In 2017,1 assisted a law enforcement agency with a missing juvenile case. Authorities 
had suspicion initially that she may have run away, but became more concerned when all of her social networks 
became dormant and her cell phone stopped being used. Her Twitter profile possessed no valuable Tweets, and 
1 could not find any deleted content to recover. I supplied her name to Spoonbill and immediately received a 
log of changes to her Twitter profile. Two months prior to her disappearance, she listed her Snapchat username 
on her biography. This led me to her Snapchat profile photo. This photo and username had not been present in 
any of my previous investigations, and revealed a whole new world of leads. The username was associated with
On a final note about Twitter, I believe it is under-utilized by most investigators. We tend to find our target's 
profile on Twitter, scroll a bit, and quickly dismiss it. In my experience, the information most valuable to my 
case is never present in this live official view.
Similar to the way that users delete Tweets and comments, they also modify the information within their Twitter 
biography on their profile page. Several sites have come and gone which attempt to record these modifications, 
and my current favorite is Spoonbill. Use of this free service from the home page requires you to log in to your 
Twitter account. However, a direct URL query will display any stored results. If you were researching my Twitter 
handle, the following address would bypass the account login, and the result is displayed in Figure 11.21.
The graphical output of this resource is impressive, but the CSV export is more useful. Figure 11.20 displays the 
web view, and the CSV export option can be seen in the upper middle. Additionally, we can query an account 
directly via static URL. This allows us to include this resource in our automated tools. My account can be seen 
at the following URL.

an email address, which was used by the missing person to create another Facebook profile. The username from 
Facebook revealed her user ID number, which was used in the Facebook search tools mentioned previously. 
The "hidden" images connected to this account provided many interesting suspects. Within an hour, a single 
suspect had emerged from die new discoveries, and die juvenile was located safely nearby. I cannot overstate 
die necessity to retrieve modified and deleted content during ever}’ Twitter investigation.
The remaining sections of this page identify current posts, followers, people following, favorites, and lists. The 
main analytics portion identifies the average number of posts by day of the week and by hour of the day, as seen 
in Figure 11.22. It also displays from which platforms die user Tweets. Figure 11.23 displays this portion. This 
data discloses diat the target has an Android and an iPhone, and that the majority of his Twitter time is spent 
on a Mac computer. This also identifies his preferred web browser, check-in utility, photo sharing sendee, and 
video sharing sendee. Other information includes his Tweets that arc most "favorited" and "ReTwceted"; the 
users to whom he replies most often; and the users whom he mentions more than others.
One Twitter analytics website that stands out from the rest is Twitonomy. This is the most complete analytics 
sendee that I have found for a single Twitter handle. A typical user search would fill four pages of screenshots. 
A search of one user revealed the following details.
He has posted 8,689 Tweets
He is following 170 people
He has 17,079 followers
He joined Twiner on June 14, 2009
He averages 5 Tweets per day
He has mentioned 4,175 other Twitter users
He replies to 34% of posts to him
He has ReTwceted 621 posts (15%)

This service only displays the most recent one million Tweets on an international map. They do not have access 
to every Tweet available, often referred to as the "firehose", but they offer new Tweets even’ second. 1 would 
never rely on this map for complete data about a location. However, monitoring a large event can provide live 
intelligence in an easily viewed format. 1 recommend using a mouse scroll wheel to zoom into your location of 
interest. Once you are at a level that you can see single Tweets, you can click any of them to see the content. 
The page will automatically refresh as new information is posted.
There are a surprising number of Twitter accounts that are completely fake. These are bought and sold daily by 
shady people who want to make their profiles appear more popular than they really are. 1 have seen a lot of
While privacy-aware individuals have disabled the location feature of their accounts, many users enjoy 
broadcasting their location at all times. Identifying a user's location during a Twitter post is sometimes possible 
through various methods. Prior to 2014, identifying the GPS details of every post of man}’ users was simple. 
Today, most of these identification techniques are no longer working. A manual Twitter search method for 
identifying posts by location was explained earlier. That technique is best for current or live information, and is 
limited to only recent posts. You may have a need for historical details from previous posts from a specific 
location. I have had better success with historical data than current content in regard to geolocation. I believe 
this is because most people unknowingly shared their location while Tweeting for many years. When Twitter 
changed the default location option to "Disabled", most users never intentionally re-enabled the feature. 
Fortunately, there arc third-part}’ websites that collected this historical data, and can assist with easy searching. 
The following options will work best when you are investigating events that occurred several years prior. Whil 
you may get lucky and receive some recent posts, the majority could be quite old.

Omnisci is a massive database platform developed through collaboration between MIT and Harvard. 
Historically, each college had their own interface into this data, which supplied Twitter post locations from past 
Tweets. Each interface provided new ways of searching information. Both websites have been disabled, and the 
entire project has warped into Omnisci. This website can search by topic, username, or location. It can also 
combine all three options to conduct a detailed search. Results appear as blue dots on a dark map. Each dot 
represents a Tweet which possesses location data to the chosen area.

This tool defines ‘fake followers* as accounts 
that arc unreachable and will not see the 
account's tweets (either because they’re 
spam, bots. propaganda, etc or because 
they’re no longer active on Twitter).
The most robust option is SparkToro. Analyzing my own account, it declared that 28% of my followers were 
"accounts that are unreachable and will not see the account's tweets", as seen in Figure 11.24. It also provided 
some metrics and a full explanation as to how it achieves its results. This is something die others do not disclose. 
Once you have logged in to a Twiner account, you can query further users at the following static URL.
target profiles that have been padded with these fake followers. There are two websites that will assist in 
distinguishing the authentic profiles from the fraudulent. They both require you to be logged in to a Twitter 
account, and I will compare the results of each.
Ever) week, a new site arrives that takes advantage of die public data that Twitter shares with the world. These 
sites offer unique ways of searching for information that Twitter does not allow on their main page. This partial 
list is a good start to finding information relevant to your target. I encourage readers to follow my blog, podcast, 
and Twitter account for any updates which surface after this book has been published.
This option identified 9% of my followers as "fake" and provided very few details. It also allows for submission 
through a static URL, but you still need to request an audit once you get to the page. The following would 
display results for my own page.
This site allows for a search of an exact Twitter profile name, and provides the average time period that this user 
sleeps. The historical Tweets are analyzed according to the times of posts. Data is then presented that suggests 
when the user is usually sleeping due to lack of posting during a specific time period. A query of Kevin Mitnick 
revealed that he is likely to be sleeping between 12am and 7am according to his Tweets. .Although the idea was 
probably executed as a fun site, it can be quite useful.

Earlier, I explained how I use TweetBeaver to filter most of my Twitter friend and follower data. If it should 
become unavailable, there are two additional websites which can assist. Twiangulate identifies mutual friends on 
two specific accounts. In one example, 521 people were friends with one of my subjects. However, only 15 were 
friends with both targets of my investigation. This can quickly identify key users associated within an inner circle 
of subjects. All 15 subjects were listed within the results including full name, photo, bio, and location. While 
Twiangulate has assisted me in the past, I now recommend Followerwonk as a superior solution when you have 
multiple suspects.
This Twitter analytics tool provides a simple yet thorough report. The website requires that you log in to your 
Twitter account through this service, and the report includes the following information. My own can be seen 
at https://tinfoleak.com/reports2/inteltechniques.html.
This simple tool provides one feature that I have found helpful in my investigations. Once you supply the target 
Twitter username, it collects the most recent 3,200 Tweets and creates a word cloud. This identifies the most 
common words used within posts by the target. There are several sites that do this, but this service takes it a 
vital step further. Clicking on any word within the result displays only the Tweets that include the selected term. 
Clicking on any of the text circles would immediately identify posts related to those terms. I have used this when 
I have a target with too many posts to read quickly. TweetTopic allows me to quickly learn what my target posts 
about and immediately delve into any topics of interest to my investigation.
I found myself using many of these manual Twitter techniques daily. In order to prevent repetitive typing of the 
same addresses and searches, 1 created a custom tool with an all-in-one solution. Download the archive 
mentioned previously to access this resource. This page includes embedded JavaScript that will structure and 
execute web addresses based on your provided information.
Figure 11.25 displays the current state of this tool. Any utilities that do not look familiar will be described in the 
remaining pages of this book. This tool will replicate many of the Twitter searches that you have read about 
here. The first option on the left side populates all of the search fields with your target's Twitter name when 
entered there. This should save time and avoid redundant pasting of data. Clicking "Go" next to each option
This service is very similar to the previous Twitter analytics options. Providing a Twitter username presents the 
typical bio, statistics, topics, hashtags, and mentions analysis that you can find other places. I find the following 
option of most interest to my investigations. I previously explained Sleeping Time as a resource to learn a target's 
usual sleep pattern based on posting times. FollerMe provides a bit more detail including posting patterns per 
hour. Note that the results are displayed in Universal Time, so you will need to convert as appropriate for your 
suspect. Since I am on the east coast (UTC -5), my own example indicates that I tend to never post before 8:00 
a.m. or after 11:00 p.m. My peak Tweeting time is at 11:00 a.m. There is a very obvious sleep pattern present 
within this result.
