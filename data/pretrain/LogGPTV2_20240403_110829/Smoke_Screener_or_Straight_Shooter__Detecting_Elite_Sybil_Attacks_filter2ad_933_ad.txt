### Sybil User Detection and Evaluation

#### Sybilness Index Construction
To effectively identify elite Sybil users, it is insufficient to consider only the participation rate \(\rho_u \in C\). Instead, we incorporate both the participation rate \(\rho_u \in C\) and the number of reviews \(N_u \in C\) for each user \(u\) in community \(C\). The final index, termed "Sybilness," is calculated as a weighted average of \(N_u \in C\) with respect to \(\rho_u \in C\) across all communities \(C\):

\[ f(u) = \sum_{C} \rho_u \in C \cdot N_u \in C \]

This Sybilness score \(f(u)\) is used to determine the likelihood that a user is an elite Sybil user. Note that the Sybilness score can exceed 1.

#### Annotating Reviews by Elite Sybil Users
Not all reviews posted by elite Sybil users are fake. To differentiate, each review is annotated with a score defined as \(\rho_u \in C \cdot P_C(k)\), where \(P_C(k)\) is the probability that a review \(k\) is part of a Sybil campaign. This score can be used to filter out fake reviews or regulate CAPTCHA frequency.

### Evaluation

#### Data Collection
We developed a Python-based crawler to analyze the HTML structure of store and user pages on Dianping. The crawler collected reviews from January 1, 2014, to June 15, 2015. Starting with four hand-picked overhyped stores, we expanded the dataset by crawling users who wrote reviews in these stores and the stores they commented on. The final dataset includes 10,541,931 reviews, 32,933 stores, and 3,555,154 users. We categorized the stores into 13 types, with cinemas having the highest percentage of overhyped stores (over 30%).

#### Ground-Truth Dataset
For Sybil community detection, we manually labeled a subset of communities. A community is labeled as Sybil if it meets at least two of the following criteria:
1. **Massive Filtered Reviews**: A large proportion of reviews in the community are filtered by Dianping's Sybil detection system.
2. **Duplicate User Reviews**: Reviews by a user in the community are similar and focused on one or two stores.
3. **Spatio-Temporal Review Pattern**: Unusual sudden increases in the number of reviews for a store, indicating potential collusion.

Five Chinese undergraduate students were hired to label the communities. For cases without consensus, a majority vote was used.

#### Results and Detection Accuracy
**Sybil Community Detection:**
- ELSIEDET detected 710 communities.
- Randomly selected 170 communities as ground truth, labeling 117 as Sybil and 53 as benign.
- Using 8 features, SVM performed best with 96.45% F1 score and 99.42% AUC.

**Elite Sybil User Detection:**
- ELSIEDET identified 12,292 elite Sybil users.
- Manual validation of the top 1,000 flagged users resulted in 938 confirmed elite Sybil users, achieving a precision rate of 93.8%.
- Random sampling of 1,000 flagged users also showed a high precision rate of 90.7%.

#### System Performance
ELSIEDET was evaluated on a server with Intel CPU E3-1220 v3 @ 3.10GHz and 16GB memory. The most time-consuming step is computing pairwise similarity between potential collusive users, which took approximately 110 minutes. The remaining steps took about 22 minutes.

### Measurement and Analysis

#### Comparison with Regular Sybil Users
- **Review Distribution**: Elite Sybil users post a significant number of non-Sybil reviews to mimic genuine users. Regular Sybil users follow the Pareto principle, with 20% of users posting 60% of fake reviews.
- **Filtered Reviews**: Sybil communities have a higher percentage of filtered reviews compared to benign communities, validating the accuracy of our detection methodology.

#### Temporal Dynamics
- **User Posting Period**: Analyzed the posting periods of elite Sybil users to understand their strategies.
- **Sybil Campaign Duration**: Examined the duration of Sybil campaigns to identify patterns.

### Conclusion
ELSIEDET effectively detects Sybil communities and elite Sybil users with high precision. The system's performance and the analysis of user behavior provide valuable insights into the strategies employed by Sybil users.
