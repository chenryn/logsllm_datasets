User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is related to the system's network connection. It begins with the AirPort_Brcm43xx disabling WWEN, followed by the remote IP being set up for keepalive. The system then wakes up due to ARPT (Network) and the AppleActuatorHIDEventDriver is terminated. The BezelServices then asserts a failure, followed by the BSSID changing and a button report being sent. The CCFile then receives a capture notice and AWDL is resumed. The en0 then receives a 802.11d country code and the CCFile exits. The networkd then changes the NAT64 ifstate and AWDL is suspended. Finally, the hibernate page list is skipped and the hibernate teardown is completed.
