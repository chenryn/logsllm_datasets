sensors, we put the smartphone on the same tabletop (surface)
as the loudspeaker and used the word data set [24] as described
in Section IV. We set the volume of the loudspeaker to be at
the maximum value (99db) to achieve the most response in
the motion sensor readings. The surface used was one of the
surfaces that had showed effects of 280Hz tone and multi-tone
at 90db. The resulting setup is depicted in Appendix Figure 1.
Frequency Domain Analysis: We plot the recorded signal
from gyroscope and accelerometer in the frequency domain
that are depicted in Appendix Figure 4a (x axis rotation) and
Figure 4b (x axis), respectively. Similar frequency spectrums
were found for y and z axis rotation for the gyroscope and
y and z axis for the accelerometer. From the spectrum, we
can see a noticeable footprint for the speech signal on the
accelerometer spectrum (around the 3 second mark) that is
absent in the gyroscope spectrum. Thus, accelerometer seems
to be more sensitive to conductive vibrations from the surface
than the gyroscope. Even though, in our set-up we did not
observe any noticeable effect on gyroscope, the fact that multi-
tone showed an effect on gyroscope indicates that such an
effect may also exist for speech signals, as shown in [1].

Fig. 3: Comparison of sensor behavior under ambient
locations and in presence of speech in the Loudspeaker-Same-
Surface scenario. Maximum variance in sensor readings (in absence of speech) at quiet locations 1, 2, 3, 4 is plotted along
side maximum variance in sensor readings (in presence of speech) to determine the effect of speech on sensors. Due to surface
vibrations from loudspeaker, there is a noticeable effect on accelerometer readings that pushes the blue line plot signiﬁcantly
higher than the line plots of quiet locations (denoted by green, magenta, cyan, and red line plots).
are shown in Figure 3. The gyroscope readings for x axis
(Figure 3a) show that maximum variation in sensor readings
in presence of speech are comparable to readings taken in
absence of speech at quiet locations (between 0.004 and 0.010
rad/s). Maximum variation in readings for y and z axis
follow similar pattern (Figure 3b and 3c) falling between 0.005
and 0.012 rad/s, and between 0.004 and 0.007 rad/s. The
accelerometer readings in Figure 3d, for the x axis, show that
the maximum variation (between 0.104 and 2.066 m/s2) in
presence of speech is higher than in absence of any speech
at the four locations (at 0.107 m/s2). Maximum variations
shown on y axis (Figure 3e) follow similar pattern (between
0.113 and 2.511 m/s2) for speech and 0.111 m/s2 without
speech, while maximum variations in readings along z axis
(Figure 3f) are much more higher than the readings along x
and y axis. The readings are between 0.555 and 7.073 m/s2
in presence of speech while they remains the same (around
0.111 m/s2) in absence of speech.
2) The Loudspeaker-Different-Surface Scenario: For the
Loudspeaker-Different-Surface scenario, we put
the smart-
phone on a different surface from the loudspeaker and played
the word list from the word data set [24] as described in the
previous section. We set the volume of the loudspeaker to be
at the maximum value (99db) to achieve the highest possible
response in the motion sensor readings. The resulting setup is
depicted in Appendix Figure 2.
Frequency Domain Analysis: We analyzed the signal from
gyroscope and accelerometer readings in the frequency do-
main. The resulting spectrum is depicted in Figure 4c and
Figure 4d, respectively. The plotted gyroscope readings are
along x axis of rotation for the gyroscope and along x axis for
the accelerometer. We looked for signs of speech around 3.35
second mark that denotes the beginning of speech as per the
microphone recording. Both the spectrum ﬁgures seem to be
devoid of any noticeable footprint of the speech signal around
the intended time mark. This leads us to believe that speech
signals traveling through air may have no noticeable effect on
the motion sensors as per the frequency domain analysis.
Time Domain Analysis: In addition to frequency domain,
we also analyzed the readings in time domain as per our
measurement metrics and the results are shown in Figure 4 for
gyroscope and accelerometer. The gyroscope readings along x
and z axis in Figure 4a and 4c show that sensor behavior is
similar in presence and absence of speech (maximum range
varies between 0.004 and 0.008 rad/s). The readings for
y axis in Figure 4b show that the sensor reading with and
without speech have the variation for maximum range around
0.005 and 0.009 rad/s. We observe two spikes for speech
crossing 0.009 rad/s but there also exists two green spikes
around the same value that indicate that this behavior is also
displayed sometimes in absence of speech. For accelerometer,
the maximum variation in readings with or without speech
