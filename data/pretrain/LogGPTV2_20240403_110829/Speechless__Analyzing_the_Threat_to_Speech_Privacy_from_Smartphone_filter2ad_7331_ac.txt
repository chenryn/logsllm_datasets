### Experimental Setup and Analysis

#### 1. The Loudspeaker-Same-Surface Scenario

To conduct the experiment, we placed the smartphone on the same tabletop as the loudspeaker. We used the word dataset [24] described in Section IV. The loudspeaker volume was set to the maximum (99 dB) to maximize the response in the motion sensor readings. The surface chosen was one that had previously shown effects of a 280 Hz tone and multi-tone at 90 dB. The experimental setup is illustrated in Appendix Figure 1.

**Frequency Domain Analysis:**
We analyzed the recorded signals from the gyroscope and accelerometer in the frequency domain. The results are depicted in Appendix Figure 4a (x-axis rotation for the gyroscope) and Figure 4b (x-axis for the accelerometer). Similar frequency spectra were observed for the y and z axes for both sensors. The accelerometer spectrum showed a noticeable footprint of the speech signal around the 3-second mark, which was absent in the gyroscope spectrum. This suggests that the accelerometer is more sensitive to conductive vibrations from the surface compared to the gyroscope. Although no significant effect was observed on the gyroscope in this setup, previous studies [1] have indicated that multi-tone signals can affect the gyroscope, suggesting that such an effect may also exist for speech signals.

**Time Domain Analysis:**
The time domain analysis results are presented in Figure 3. For the x-axis, the gyroscope readings (Figure 3a) show that the maximum variation in sensor readings in the presence of speech (between 0.004 and 0.010 rad/s) is comparable to the readings taken in the absence of speech at quiet locations. The y and z axes (Figures 3b and 3c) follow a similar pattern, with variations between 0.005 and 0.012 rad/s and 0.004 and 0.007 rad/s, respectively. The accelerometer readings along the x-axis (Figure 3d) show that the maximum variation in the presence of speech (between 0.104 and 2.066 m/s²) is higher than in the absence of speech (0.107 m/s²). The y-axis (Figure 3e) follows a similar pattern, with variations between 0.113 and 2.511 m/s² in the presence of speech and 0.111 m/s² without speech. The z-axis (Figure 3f) shows the highest variations, with readings between 0.555 and 7.073 m/s² in the presence of speech, while remaining around 0.111 m/s² in the absence of speech.

#### 2. The Loudspeaker-Different-Surface Scenario

In this scenario, the smartphone was placed on a different surface from the loudspeaker, and the word list from the word dataset [24] was played. The loudspeaker volume was again set to the maximum (99 dB) to achieve the highest possible response in the motion sensor readings. The setup is illustrated in Appendix Figure 2.

**Frequency Domain Analysis:**
We analyzed the gyroscope and accelerometer readings in the frequency domain. The resulting spectra are depicted in Figures 4c and 4d, respectively. The gyroscope readings are along the x-axis of rotation, and the accelerometer readings are along the x-axis. We examined the spectra for signs of speech around the 3.35-second mark, which corresponds to the start of speech in the microphone recording. Neither spectrum showed any noticeable footprint of the speech signal at the intended time mark, suggesting that speech signals traveling through air may not significantly affect the motion sensors.

**Time Domain Analysis:**
In addition to the frequency domain analysis, we also analyzed the sensor readings in the time domain. The results are shown in Figure 4. The gyroscope readings along the x and z axes (Figures 4a and 4c) indicate similar behavior in the presence and absence of speech, with the maximum range varying between 0.004 and 0.008 rad/s. The y-axis readings (Figure 4b) show a maximum range variation between 0.005 and 0.009 rad/s. Two spikes in the speech data cross 0.009 rad/s, but similar spikes are also observed in the absence of speech, indicating that this behavior is not unique to speech. For the accelerometer, the maximum variation in readings with or without speech is consistent across all axes, with no significant differences observed.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the sensitivity of motion sensors to different types of vibrations and the potential impact of speech signals on these sensors.
