Subject: Issue Reproducing Loss and Accuracy in Example Code

Hi,

I am writing to inquire about an issue I encountered while attempting to replicate the results presented in the provided example. The example claims that a loss of 0.65 can be achieved within 25 epochs. However, when I ran the code using both the Theano and TensorFlow backends, with the default hyper-parameters, I was unable to achieve a validation loss lower than 2.30 and an accuracy higher than 0.1 after 25 epochs.

Could you please let me know if I might be missing something or if there are any additional steps required to reproduce the stated results? Additionally, I would appreciate it if anyone else could attempt to reproduce this and share their findings. A friend of mine has also attempted to run the code and experienced similar issues.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
