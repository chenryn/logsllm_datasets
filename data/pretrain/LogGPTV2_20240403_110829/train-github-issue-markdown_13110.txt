Hi,
The example here  claims to go to 0.65 loss in 25 epochs. I tried out the code
with both the theano and tensorflow backend and with the default hyper-
parameters as is but it does not seem to go below 2.30 validation (and 0.1
accuracy) in 25 epochs.
Is there anything that I am doing wrong and can anyone else reproduce this?
(At least a friend of mine could)
