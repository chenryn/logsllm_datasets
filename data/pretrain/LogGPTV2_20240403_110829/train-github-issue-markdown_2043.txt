  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
There will be no warnings in console.  
There will be a line with `timeout`, not with `transitionDuration` here  
https://github.com/mui-org/material-
ui/blob/v1-beta/src/Stepper/StepContent.d.ts#L18
## Current Behavior
This warning in console
    Warning: Unknown prop `transitionDuration` on  tag. Remove this prop from the element.
    in div (created by Transition)
        in Transition (created by Collapse)
        in Collapse (created by withStyles(Collapse))
        in withStyles(Collapse) (created by StepContent)
    ...
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
There is no such warning in codesandbox example. But I can see it in my
project. Also there is a `transitionDuration` mention -- see link above.  
If it's not enough - I'll try to create an example with the warning later.
