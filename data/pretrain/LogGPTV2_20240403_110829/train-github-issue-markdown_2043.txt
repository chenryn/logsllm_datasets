### Issue Report

#### I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
- There should be no warnings in the console.
- The code at the following line should use `timeout` instead of `transitionDuration`:
  - [Link to the relevant code](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v1-beta/src/Stepper/StepContent.d.ts#L18)

---

#### Current Behavior
- The following warning appears in the console:
  ```
  Warning: Unknown prop `transitionDuration` on <div> tag. Remove this prop from the element.
    in div (created by Transition)
    in Transition (created by Collapse)
    in Collapse (created by withStyles(Collapse))
    in withStyles(Collapse) (created by StepContent)
    ...
  ```

---

#### Steps to Reproduce
- The warning does not appear in the CodeSandbox example, but it does appear in my project.
- The `transitionDuration` prop is mentioned in the code at the specified line (see link above).
- If more information is needed, I will attempt to create a minimal example that reproduces the warning.
