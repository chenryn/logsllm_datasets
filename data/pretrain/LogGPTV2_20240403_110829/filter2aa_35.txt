Talk Outline: 
• Why do we need Vulnerability Management? 
• What do we need? 
• Vulnerability Management Lifecycle 
• What won’t work? 
• How to mature program?

Vulnerabilities- Are we vulnerable? Where? 
1. OpenSSL 'Heartbleed 
2. Shellshock  
3. Stagefright 
4. W32 conficker worm 
5. MS17-010

External RDP port 3389 
WPA2 Krack 
Apache 5 
Windows 2003

Why do we need Vulnerability Management? 
•Vulnerability and threats 
•Improve organizational security resiliency  
•Compliance requirement

Con 
• False positive 
• Expensive 
Pro 
• Accurate, less false 
positives 
• Much more in depth

Vulnerability Prioritization 
Always understand the vulnerability  
• Prioritization 
• The money making software and server 
• Patch vulnerabilities that already have known exploits 
• Unsupported software 
• Look for the one solution that fix many vulnerabilities 
• CVSS is a good start, but take them to the next level 
• Apply system scoring and criticality ratings. Etc, environmental 
factors

Report

Report 
•Target the audiences with the specific report type 
• There is no one report fits all 
•Report automation and template 
• Integrate with current ticket and report process 
•Always include SLA along with report 
• 14, 30, 60 days, etc.

What to include in the report or ticket? 
Dear Sysadmin: 
Title:      [Some kind of security identifier ] [SLA] [vulnerability name] 
Body:  
include patch name some where in the report 
where was found, IP, hostname, count. (excel is fine) 
Mention SLA again, nicely.

Remediation 
•If the current patching process works, follow it. Try 
not to reinvent new patch process, it will cause 
confusion 
•Involve risk management depending on the outcome, 
initiate risk exception 
•Keep track of SLA and hold owners responsible.  Don’t 
fall into the ticket black hole

Verification 
•Verify the same way you found it for accurate result 
•Verify the remediation solution did not introduce 
more vulnerabilities 
• Document the verification procedures and report in a central 
location… You will thank yourself later

What won’t work 
•Inaccurate vulnerability report or metrics 
•No Cooperation with Risk Management 
•Insufficient patch management program

I have everything, now what I can do? 
• Security configuration management 
• Incorporate threat intel feed for organization specific threat 
vulnerabilities 
• Look for things that attacker likes to find that aren’t 
vulnerabilities 
• Rely more on manual testing that can identify more complex 
vulnerabilities
