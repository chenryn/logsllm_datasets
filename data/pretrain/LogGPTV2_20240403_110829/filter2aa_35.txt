#### Talk Outline:
1. Why do we need Vulnerability Management?
2. What do we need?
3. Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
4. What won’t work?
5. How to mature the program?

#### Vulnerabilities: Are We Vulnerable? Where?
- **OpenSSL 'Heartbleed'**
- **Shellshock**
- **Stagefright**
- **W32 Conficker Worm**
- **MS17-010**

**Examples of Common Vulnerabilities:**
- **External RDP Port 3389**
- **WPA2 KRACK**
- **Apache**
- **Windows 2003**

**Note:** Most breaches are not from zero-day vulnerabilities. (Cited: Verizon 2016 DBIR)

#### Why Do We Need Vulnerability Management?
- **Vulnerability and Threats:** To identify and mitigate potential security risks.
- **Improve Organizational Security Resiliency:** Enhance the ability to withstand and recover from cyber threats.
- **Compliance Requirement:** Meet regulatory and industry standards.

#### What Do You Need for Vulnerability Management?
- **Vulnerability Scanner**
- **Asset Management (CMDB)**
- **Ticketing System**
- **People Skills (Collaboration and Communication)**

#### Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
1. **Detect**
2. **Prioritize**
3. **Report**
4. **Remediate**
5. **Verification**

#### Detect: Vulnerability Scanning
- **Manual Detection:**
  - **Pros:**
    - Easy to use (depending on the tool)
    - Enterprise-level scanning capability
  - **Cons:**
    - False positives
    - Can be expensive

- **Automated Detection:**
  - **Pros:**
    - Accurate, fewer false positives
    - More in-depth analysis
  - **Cons:**
    - Time-consuming
    - Requires highly skilled personnel

#### Prioritize
- **Understand the Vulnerability:**
  - **Prioritization Criteria:**
    - Criticality of the affected software or server
    - Patch vulnerabilities with known exploits
    - Unsupported software
    - Solutions that address multiple vulnerabilities
  - **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):**
    - Use CVSS as a starting point, but consider additional factors such as system criticality and environmental context.

#### Report
- **Target the Audience:**
  - Tailor reports to specific stakeholders.
  - No one-size-fits-all report.
- **Report Automation and Templates:**
  - Integrate with existing ticketing and reporting processes.
  - Include SLAs (e.g., 14, 30, 60 days) in reports.
  
- **Example Report Content:**
  - **Title:** [Security Identifier] [SLA] [Vulnerability Name]
  - **Body:**
    - Patch name
    - Location (IP, hostname, count)
    - Mention SLA again, politely.

#### Remediation
- **Follow Existing Processes:**
  - If the current patching process works, follow it. Avoid creating new processes to prevent confusion.
- **Involve Risk Management:**
  - Initiate risk exceptions if necessary.
- **Track SLAs:**
  - Hold owners accountable and avoid the "ticket black hole."

#### Verification
- **Verify Remediation:**
  - Use the same method used to detect the vulnerability for accurate results.
  - Ensure remediation does not introduce new vulnerabilities.
  - Document verification procedures and store them centrally for future reference.

#### Mix & Match the Lifecycle
- **Flexible Approach:**
  - Adapt the lifecycle steps based on the specific needs and context of your organization.

#### What Won’t Work
- **Inaccurate Vulnerability Reports or Metrics:**
  - Inaccurate data can lead to poor decision-making.
- **Lack of Cooperation with Risk Management:**
  - Collaboration is key to effective vulnerability management.
- **Insufficient Patch Management Program:**
  - A robust patch management process is essential for timely remediation.

#### Next Steps for Maturity
- **Security Configuration Management:**
  - Implement and maintain secure configurations.
- **Incorporate Threat Intelligence Feeds:**
  - Stay informed about organization-specific threats.
- **Identify Non-Vulnerability Risks:**
  - Look for other security weaknesses that attackers may exploit.
- **Enhance Manual Testing:**
  - Conduct more complex vulnerability assessments manually.

#### Conclusion
- **Final Thoughts:**
  - A sustainable vulnerability management program is essential for maintaining organizational security and compliance.

#### Q&A
- **Questions and Answers:**
  - Open the floor for any questions or further discussion.
