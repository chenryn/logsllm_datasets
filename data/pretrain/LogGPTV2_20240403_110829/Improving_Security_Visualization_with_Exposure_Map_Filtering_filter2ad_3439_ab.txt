### T2.a: Not-in-NEM Non-Threatening
This table includes flows from T2 where the source IP addresses do not have any corresponding flows in T1. The exposure map filtering technique assumes that these connection attempts are not a significant threat to the target network. This is because all probes from these sources have targeted closed ports, and thus, they have not obtained any meaningful information about the services offered by the target network.

### T2.b: Not-in-NEM Threatening
This table contains flows from T2 where the source IP addresses also have flows in T1. Therefore, these source IP addresses have queried both legitimate services and closed ports on the target network.

### Table T3: Suspicious
This table includes all flows from T2 (both T2.a and T2.b) and T1.b. These flows are labeled as "suspicious" because the source IP addresses have probed at least one closed port in the network.

### Table T4: Dangerous
This table includes all flows from T1.b and T2.b. These flows represent traffic from IP sources that have probed at least one closed port and also attempted to connect to an open port. According to the philosophy of the exposure maps technique, these flows are more likely to be malicious. If these IP sources are adversaries, they might attempt to exploit the open ports they have discovered.

### Data Structure and Logical Tables
The full dataset of externally initiated traffic, as described in Section 2.2, is stored in a data structure called the flows table. Additionally, the following subsets of the logical tables are constructed: T1.b, T2, T3, and T4. Instead of duplicating data, these tables store links to the entries in the flows table. Statistics for each of these tables, based on the dataset described in Section 2.2, are presented in Table 2.

### Illustrative Visualizations
Using the filtering indicated by the logical tables in Section 3, we plot netflow data in either 2D or 3D space. We have selected nine sets of graphs to illustrate the advantages of the filtering technique. Most of these graph types are simple or well-known. Each set of graphs contrasts the information conveyed before and after filtering. In all cases, the patterns in malicious activity were discovered through the filtered visualization process, providing valuable insights over the original unfiltered graphs. For each example, the unfiltered visualization (item (a)) includes all externally initiated flows, while the filtered visualization (item (b)) only includes flow data from the dangerous table (T4).

#### Figure 2: Destination IP and Port from Full Source IP Address
- **Figure 2(a)**: Shows a high number of source IPs probing a single port on the entire class C destination network, with dense areas around low-order ports.
- **Figure 2(b)**: Filters out non-threatening traffic, leaving only potentially malicious activities. For example, some horizontal scans in this figure target the first 64 addresses of our subnet, suggesting that the scanner is aware of our network topology.
- **Figures 2(c) and 2(d)**: Project the 3D visualization to a 2D view, showing the exact destination ports more clearly while hiding the destination IP address. The left-most horizontal scan in Figure 2(a) targets port 32000 TCP, which is not offered. In Figure 2(b), a random scan targeting port 9999 was found, and further investigation revealed a single source attempting connections to ports 143 TCP (IMAP) and 9999 TCP on all hosts, as well as port 25 (SMTP). This source may be categorized as an adversary and should be closely monitored.

#### Figure 3: Number of Distinct Source IP Addresses per Destination Port
- **Figure 3(a)**: Shows a high number of unique sources targeting ports 1-1000. An increase in inbound flows to port 53 starting on December 1 was noted.
- **Figure 3(b)**: After filtering, a consistently high number of sources targeting port 53 across the entire capture period is observed. Further investigation revealed 11 unique sources probing port 53 (both TCP and UDP) every day.

#### Figure 4: Source Port Over Time
- **Figure 4(a)**: Shows a high degree of clutter due to the random allocation of source ports.
- **Figure 4(b)**: Provides a cleaner view of the source ports used by dangerous sources. Four evenly spaced vertical lines in the center of the plot indicate four distinct IP addresses in separate class A networks attempting to bruteforce SSH accounts. Each source was found to be scanning the full destination class C for SSH service (TCP port 22) and focusing on the three responding hosts.

#### Figure 5: Frequent Originators Among Source IP Addresses
- **Figure 5(a)**: Shows a large number of source IP addresses attempting connections over 15 times in the 4-week capture.
- **Figure 5(b)**: After filtering, only four peaks remain, representing four groups of sources each probing for more than 25 days. Two small networks with Chinese ISPs were identified, with hosts exhibiting consistent behavior. These 10 IP addresses should be monitored closely.

#### Figure 6: Destination Port Over Time
- **Figure 6(a)**: Shows frequent targeting of low-order ports, with a vertical scan on November 28.
- **Figure 6(b)**: After filtering, the vertical scan is removed, revealing that the source probed 1036 ports on a non-existing host. Since the source did not try to connect to other hosts, the traffic was safely ignored.

#### Figure 7: Distinct Destination Ports Targeted
- **Figure 7(a)**: A single source attempting connections to nearly 1200 ports ruins the visualization.
- **Figure 7(b)**: After filtering, the remaining lines reveal that every source classified as dangerous visited at most 4 distinct destination ports. Two sources were found probing common web server ports (80, 443, 8000, and 8080) on the first 64 addresses of the target network.

#### Figure 8: Destination Port from Class B Source Networks
- **Figure 8(a)**: Shows several hosts in the same class B network attempting connections to a large number of destination ports.
- **Figure 8(b)**: After filtering, the distribution of dangerous class B subnets appears mostly random, with nearly all hosts targeting low-order ports.

#### Figure 9: Number of Flows per Source IP Address and Target Port
- **Figure 9(a)**: Shows a high volume of traffic from a small number of source addresses to a few destination ports.
- **Figure 9(b)**: After filtering, the spike is absent because the service (port 445, Microsoft Windows Shares) is not offered on any target network hosts. The remaining sparse activity cued us to explore the database records, revealing SSH bruteforce attacks.

These visualizations and the filtering technique provide a clear and focused view of potential threats, allowing analysts to efficiently identify and investigate suspicious and malicious activities.
