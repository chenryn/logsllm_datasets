T2.a: Not-in-NEM non-threatening. This table contains
ﬂows in T2 and whose source IP addresses have no ﬂows in T1.
Exposure map ﬁltering assumes these connection attempts are not
a signiﬁcant threat to the target network since sources, all of whose
probes have been to closed ports, have not learned what is consid-
ered signiﬁcant information from the target network (i.e., have not
learned what services are offered).
T2.b: Not-in-NEM threatening. This table contains ﬂows in
T2 and whose source IP addresses also have ﬂows in T1. Thus,
the source IP address of these ﬂows have queried both legitimate
offered services and closed ports.
Table T3: Suspicious. This table includes all ﬂows in T2 (T2.a
and T2.b) plus T1.b. We call this ‘suspicious trafﬁc’ because these
source IP addresses have probed at least one closed port in the
network.
Table T4: Dangerous. This table includes all ﬂows in T1.b plus
T2.b. This represents trafﬁc from IP sources that probed at least
one closed port and also attempted to connect to an open port.
According to the philosophy motivating the exposure maps tech-
nique, these are more likely to represent malicious ﬂows since
these IP sources, if adversaries, might attempt to send exploits to
the open ports that they have discovered.
The full dataset of externally initiated trafﬁc described in Sec-
tion 2.2 is stored in a data structure called the ﬂows table. In ad-
dition to this, the following subsets of the previously described
logical tables are actually built: tables T1.b, T2, T3, and T4 (and
rather than duplicating data, only links to the ﬂows table entries
are stored in these tables). Statistics for each of these tables, for
the dataset described in Section 2.2, are presented in Table 2.

4 Illustrative Visualizations
Using the ﬁltering as indicated by the logical tables in Sec-
tion 3, we proceed to plot netﬂow data on either a 2D or 3D space.
Although there are a large number of different types of graphs (i.e.
choices of data features to plot on the x, y and z axes), in this
section we have selected 9 sets of graphs to illustrate the advan-
tages of the ﬁltering technique. The majority of these are simple
or known graph types. Each set of graphs is intended to contrast
the information conveyed by the visualization before and after ﬁl-
tering. In all cases, the patterns in malicious activity were discov-
ered through this ﬁltered visualization process itself, with valu-
able insight gained from the ﬁltered visualizations over the origi-
nal unﬁltered graphs. For each of the examples in this section, in
the unﬁltered visualization we have plotted all externally initiated
ﬂows as item (a).
In the ﬁltered visualization (item (b) in each
graph pair) we have only plotted ﬂow data from the dangerous ta-
ble (T4) of Section 3. We emphasize that in practice, we expect
that the analyst will only need to study each item (b), with little or
no information gained from comparing (a) with (b).
Figure 2 graphs the full source IP address (plotted as an integer
from 0 to approximately 4.2 billion), the target destination host and
the destination port. Figure 2(a) shows a high number of source
IPs probing a single port on the entire class C destination network
and dense areas around low-order ports. On Figures 2(c) and 2(d),
the original 3D visualization is projected to a 2D view showing the
exact destination ports more clearly, while hiding the destination
IP address. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are similar to the “Spinning Cube
of Potential Doom” [9], except that we plot network ﬂow data as
opposed to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs. Due to the
large number of horizontal scans (probing a single port on all des-
tination IP addresses as noted by bottom-left to top-right diagonal
lines) displayed, a security analyst might have trouble identifying
which scans warrant further analysis from Figure 2(a). However,
most (if not all) horizontal scans in Figure 2(b) likely reveal some
type of malicious activity. For example we notice some horizontal
scans that only target the ﬁrst 64 addresses of our subnet, which
suggest that the scanner is aware of our network topology. The
data that was automatically removed in moving from Figure 2(a)
to 2(b) was, as previously noted, classiﬁed as non-threatening by
the exposure map ﬁltering. For example, the left-most horizon-
tal scan on Figure 2(a) belongs a single source probing all hosts
on the destination network for port 32000 TCP which is not of-
fered. On Figure 2(b) we randomly selected a scan in the middle

Figure 4. Source port over time (best viewed in color)
of the graph (selection not shown). After zooming in, we found the
port targeted was 9999 so we searched the database for the IP ad-
dresses that probed this port, and found a single source that tried to
connect to ports 143 TCP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and
9999 TCP on all hosts in this destination class C. That same source
also attempted to connect to port 25 on all hosts in the destination
subnet, ﬁnding the SMTP server along the way. This source may
be categorized as an adversary, having learned something from the
target network and might be more closely monitored for future
intrusion attempts. On Figure 2(c), we notice a single source IP
address attempting connections to a large number of TCP destina-
tion ports below 40000 (vertical line on the right). Querying the
database suggests this trafﬁc is unimportant because the source is
trying a large number of destination ports on a non-existing host;
note this trafﬁc is absent from Figure 2(d).
Figure 3 presents a count of the number of unique sources that
were seen targeting each destination port on a particular day and il-
lustrates a high number of sources attempting connections to ports
1-1000. This type of graph can help detect either groups of collab-
orating hosts or those infected by the same worm. In Figure 3(a),
we notice an increase in inbound ﬂows to port 53 beginning on
December 1. Further investigation by means of database queries
showed that the vast majority of sources going to port 53 on the
target network’s DNS server are not attempting connections to any
other ports/hosts, indicating that the DNS queries are probably le-
gitimate. Upon viewing the ﬁltered graph in Figure 3(b) (which
has been autoscaled due to less volume), we see a consistently
high number of sources targeting port 53 across the entire capture
period. Motivated by this visual cue, we discovered (by reviewing
text ﬂow records) that these are 11 unique sources probing port 53
both TCP and UDP every day.
Figure 4 plots the source port used for incoming ﬂows over
the entire capture period. Source ports might give insight as to
what operating system is being used, or what type of scan is be-
ing performed. Source port distribution is also useful for detecting
the spread of worms [21]. Source ports are usually allocated ran-
domly which explains the high degree of clutter in Figure 4(a).

ports being used by what we call dangerous sources. Though there
are quite a few patterns, we focus our attention to the 4 evenly
spaced vertical lines in the center of the plot. Triggered by this vi-
sual cue, we queried the database for the sources that match those
source ports, and we found that 4 distinct IP addresses in sepa-
rate class A networks were attempting to bruteforce secure shell
(SSH) accounts. Each one of the 4 sources was found to be scan-
ning the full destination class C for any hosts which offer the SSH
service (TCP port 22), and upon ﬁnding exactly the 3 hosts which
responded (note the 3 hosts serving the SSH service in Table 1),
changed their bruteforce attack to focus only on those hosts.
Figure 5 gives the number of days a speciﬁc source IP ad-
dress probed the network.
IP addresses that probe the network
repeatedly might be considered for additional analysis. Note that
in Figure 5(a), a large number of source IP addresses attempt con-
nections over 15 times in the 4 week capture. The ﬁltered view
leaves only only 4 peaks, representing 4 groups of sources each
probing during more than 25 days. This view is useful, as it leaves
the analyst with far less information to analyze; what the ﬁlter-
ing technique automatically removed was legitimate trafﬁc as well
as probes from source IPs going to only closed ports. By query-
ing the database for the source IPs corresponding to each one of
these 4 peaks, we were able to ﬁnd two small networks, with ad-
dresses allocated to Chinese ISPs, in which hosts exhibited the
exact same behavior. One network of 6 computers probed ports
53 TCP and UDP (Domain Name Service) on 2 of the destina-
tion network servers roughly 10 times per hour during the entire
capture period. The other network of 4 computers probed port 53
TCP and UDP as well on an hourly basis but only on one of the
target servers. These 10 IP addresses should be monitored closely,
as they have all found services the network is offering and are
exhibiting reconnaissance behavior. As another interesting obser-
vation in Figure 5(b) we see a noteworthy division between line
heights. We see either sources that return almost every day, or

sources that come back less than ﬁve days. This suggests potential

Figure 6 shows the local destination port targeted over the en-
tire capture period. Some ports are frequently targeted, particu-
larly low-order ports. On November 28, we see a scan taking place
(noted by the vertical line on Figure 6(a)). Although full vertical
scans are less common today, this choice of visualization (inde-
pendent of exposure map ﬁltering) prominently highlights remote
hosts performing such scans. A zoom-in version of the ﬁltered
graph is displayed in Figure 6(b) and shows that a small number
of low-order ports are probed throughout the capture period. An
interesting observation is that the vertical scan from November 28
is removed by the ﬁltering. Upon further investigation through
database queries, we found that the source of the scan in question
probed 1036 ports on a non-existing host on the destination net-
work. All of these probes went unanswered, and the source did not
try to connect to any other hosts. Had it tried to connect to other
target network hosts and found an open port, the ﬂows from that
source IP address would have been categorized differently through
the exposure map-based methodology of Section 3, and not re-
moved by the automatic ﬁltering. These conditions result in the
ﬁltering system (apparently safely) ignoring trafﬁc generated by
201211
this host, and omitting it in Figure 6(b).
Figure 7 shows the number of distinct destination ports tar-
geted for each source IP on a speciﬁc day. A high number of
distinct destination ports coming from a single source is what we
expect to attract an analyst’s attention since this would potentially
imply malicious activity. Notice that in Figure 7(a), a single source
attempting connections to nearly 1200 ports ruins the visualization
in its original form, likely encouraging an analyst to switch to a
logarithmic scale. However, in Figure 7(b), the large spike was
part of the data automatically ﬁltered out, and the remaining lines
reveal interesting information. In this particular example, every
source classiﬁed by exposure maps as dangerous visited at most 4
distinct destination ports. Cued by this new view we queried the
database for any hosts that attempted connections to any 4 distinct
destination ports, and found 2 sources probing for ports 80, 443,
8000, and 8080 (commonly used web server ports) on the ﬁrst 64
addresses of the target network.
Figure 8 shows in a 3D plot the targeted ports on the destina-
tion network probed from class B external networks. The x and y
axes represent the ﬁrst and second octet of the source IP address
respectively. Each point represents a single inbound ﬂow. For ex-
ample note that for a source IP of 200.200.x.x, there are several

Figure 9. Number of ﬂows per source IP address and target port
destination ports targeted (vertically). This type of plot is use-
ful for pinpointing the class B subnet sources of incoming trafﬁc
and the most targeted destination ports for each one. We notice 2
sparse vertical lines in Figure 8(a) which suggest that several hosts
in the same class B network are attempting connections to a large
number of destination ports on the target network. The lines disap-
pear after ﬁltering. The ﬁltering approach takes the position that
those sources did not learn anything useful from (i.e., got no re-
sponses from) the target network, and therefore (apparently being)
not a threat, can be safely ﬁltered out. Figure 8(b) shows a smaller
number of plotted ﬂows, allowing the analyst to notice that the dis-
tribution of dangerous class B’s appears mostly random, and that
nearly all hosts in each network were targeting low-order ports.
Figure 9 displays the trafﬁc volume (in number of ﬂows) at
each destination port along with the source of this trafﬁc (plotted
on the x axis). The noticeable vertical line in the front of Fig-
ure 9(a) represents a high volume of trafﬁc coming from a small
number of source addresses to a few destination ports. This type
of plot is helpful in highlighting source IPs sending high trafﬁc to
speciﬁc network ports. Similar numbers of ﬂows going to differ-
ent destination ports might indicate some correlations between the
sources. Although this type of activity wasn’t captured in Figure 9,
it was present in Figures 5(b) and 7(b) and helped detect hosts that
appear to be working together. The spike in Figure 9(a) turns out
to come from the same parent Class B network as the dataset’s
local network. When we queried the database for the ﬂows that
make up that spike, we discovered a single source IP attempting
connections to port 445 (Microsoft Windows Shares) on all 254
destination IPs on the target network. This spike is absent in the
ﬁltered graph (Figure 9(b)) because this service is not offered on
any of the target network’s hosts or servers. Since the target net-
work won’t reply to this type of activity, and the probing source IP
address did not probe any open ports, exposure map ﬁltering rea-
sons that these connection attempts are not an actual threat to the
target network. Thus omitting this activity from the displayed data
(as in Figure 9(b)) simpliﬁes the interpretation of the remaining
network activity, with no loss – the omitted activity is not among
the data in need of review by the analyst. One could argue, how-
ever, that the local network analyst does have a vested interest in
knowing that probing machine’s address and behavior, since in this
case it is a local machine which the analyst might be able to shut
down. Our ﬁltering tools could be easily modiﬁed to special-case
machines from the local network (or other speciﬁed classes of ma-
chines) and not ﬁlter out suspicious trafﬁc originating from them.
The visual patterns in the sparser activity that remains cued us to
explore the database records related to the peaks in Figure 9(b).
We found that these correspond to SSH bruteforce attacks.
