User: I'm having a hard time finding a conclusive answer for how to compile a Python 2.7 .py file into a executable program for Debian. Most tutorials say "we assume you've already written the manifest, etc.", but I cannot find how to do those first steps.
So, I need a step-by-step. How do I take JUST a .py file (using Python 2.7 and PyGTK) and a few .pdf and .png files that go with it, and compile all of that into a working Debian binary?
(Note: If the tutorial starts out with a tar.gz, or requires a setup.py or similar already written, I need instructions on how to get those files too.)
Assistant: Why do you think you need to compile it? Debian, like most other Linux distributions, comes with Python installed as standard, as many of the system tools depend on it. A Python script will just run.
