`runFromBundle` on FlutterView can be called only once. Some add-to-app use
cases (such as letting `RecyclerView` manage the lifecycle of the
`FlutterView`) requires us to be able to unload these bundles and load them up
again. This also affects use cases where the app bundles are dynamically
loaded from a URL. According to @sbaranov, this is one the roadmap so I am
creating a tracker issue here. Please dedupe as needed.
