ing 3X3 patterns. The most popular beginning for Pass-
O patterns is also the top-most node (Figure 4g), however
the number of Pass-O patterns that begin at the top node
(29.64%) is relatively smaller than 3X3 patterns (42.84%).
While 3X3 patterns are most likely to begin with corner
nodes, Pass-O patterns are most likely to begin with nodes

Figure 4: Feature distribution of 3X3 and Pass-O data
the pattern data to develop a Markov model based guessing
algorithm [13] and then, we use it to estimate the partial
guessing entropy [8] of 3X3 and Pass-O patterns.
6.1 Guessing Entropy
The attack technique we use is quite similar to that de-
scribed in [13]. The objective is to recover as many pat-
terns as possible using as few guesses as possible. To gain
maximum beneﬁt, pattern guesses should be generated in
decreasing order of probabilities. To estimate pattern prob-
abilities, we employ ngram-Markov model which exploits the
fact that subsequent choices in a human-generated sequence
are largely dependent on the current choices. For instance,
the letter ‘e’ is more likely to follow ‘th’ than the letter ‘z’.
In case of 3X3 patterns the adjacent nodes are more likely to
be chosen than the non-adjacent nodes. Based on this obser-
vation, the ngram-Markov model predicts the next letter in
a sequence using the preﬁx of length n − 1. The probability
of a sequence of letters s1, . . . , sl can be modelled as
P (s1, . . . , sl) = P (s1, . . . , sn−1) ·
P (si|si−n+1, . . . , si−1)
(2)
i=n
Parameters. We choose the value of n to be 3. The suit-
ability of the choice of trigrams is evident from Figure 8
given in appendix D. More than 1/6th of 3X3 patterns are
composed using the trigram 789, while 1/13th of Pass-O pat-
terns are made up of trigram 234. Further, we found that
increasing the size of n to 4 does not improve the pattern
guessability. We estimate the probabilities of trigrams that
do not appear in the dataset using the Laplace smoothing
technique.
Implementation. We use K-fold cross-validation technique
and split our dataset randomly into K = 5 disjoint equal
sized subsets. Then, we perform K iterations. In each it-
eration, we select a previously unvisited subset from K = 5
subsets, mark it as visited and use it as test set. The re-
maining 4 sets are combined and used as training set. The
size of 3X3 test set is around 13,959 while the size of Pass-O
test set is about 10,676. After ﬁxing the training set and
test set, we do the following computations.
• We assign highest probabilities to the frequent pat-
terns (count ≥ 10) appearing in the training set, so
l(cid:89)
n(cid:88)
{1,9,8,7}. To gauge the amount of randomness in a given
distribution, we use the Shannon entropy measure H.
Entropy H =
pi · log2(1/pi)
(1)
i=1
The entropy due to starting point choices of 3X3 patterns
is 2.51 bits while in case of Pass-O, the entropy is slightly
higher 2.62 bits. Further, the end point choices of 3X3 par-
ticipants are also highly biased with nearly 30% of 3X3 pat-
terns terminating at the bottom-right node. Surprisingly,
the termination choices of Pass-O patterns are relatively uni-
form. The entropy due to end point choices of 3X3 patterns
is 2.89 bits while for Pass-O patterns it is 3.14 bits.
Repetitions. Of the 69,797 3X3 patterns, only 16,310 (less
than 24%) patterns are distinct, whereas of the 53,383 Pass-
O patterns, 27,497 (more than 50%) patterns are distinct.
The most popular 3X3 pattern is the ‘Z’ shape and it con-
stitutes 3.10% of all 3X3 patterns (Figure 5). Other popular
3X3 patterns also resemble the letters of an English alpha-
bet such as ‘S’, ‘L’, ‘N’, and ‘M’. The most popular Pass-O
pattern constitutes 1.64% of all patterns and is drawn by
connecting all nodes in an anti-clockwise fashion beginning
from node 1. Other popular choices include patterns with
alternating nodes and those resembling English letters such
as ‘Z’ and ‘C’. A list of top 500 patterns can be found at [1].

Figure 5: Top 6 3X3 and Pass-O patterns from the study
Remark 2. The user-chosen Pass-O patterns are not only
visually more complex but also less repetitive and have uni-
form beginning and ending as compared to 3X3 patterns.
The data strongly suggests that the space utilized by Pass-
O patterns is much better than that of 3X3 patterns.
6. GUESSABILITY
In this section, we measure the relative strength of 3X3
and Pass-O patterns against guessing attacks. First, we use
404that they are used upfront while performing guessing.
• We compute trigram probabilities using the training
set and employ Markov model to estimate the proba-
bilities of the remaining patterns.
• We sort all patterns in decreasing order of probability.
• We use these as guesses to crack the test set patterns.
We repeat the entire process 50 times and report the mean.
Figure 6: Guessing resistance of 3X3 and Pass-O patterns
Results. Figure 6 demonstrates the success rate of guess-
ing algorithm against all (defensive + oﬀensive) patterns.
Within 5000 guesses, the attacker can recover 70% of 3X3
patterns but only 40% of Pass-O patterns. Even within the
ﬁrst 20 guesses, the attacker can crack 18.55% of 3X3 pat-
terns but only 11.51% of Pass-O patterns. Therefore, Pass-
O patterns are more resistant to guessing attacks.
Table 4 compares the percentage of patterns cracked on
diﬀerent layouts within the ﬁrst 20 guesses. Our guessing
algorithm cracked 18.55% of 3X3 patterns, 11% more than
that reported in [6]. Also, Pass-O patterns are much stronger
as compared to 3X3 and 4X4 patterns [6], since within 20
guesses the attacker can crack 18.55% of 3X3 and 19.90%
of 4X4 patterns but only 11.51% of Pass-O patterns.
6.2 Partial Guessing Entropy
Now, we compare the partial guessing entropy [8] (for def-
inition refer to appendix E) of 3X3 and Pass-O patterns. We
deﬁne the probability pi as the fraction of patterns cracked
by ith guess of our Markov-based algorithm. We found that
the eﬀort required to crack the ﬁrst 10% (G0.1) of 3X3 pat-
terns is just 5.80 bits while for Pass-O the eﬀort is 7.06 bits
(Table 4). Note that the guessing resistance (G0.1) of 3X3
patterns (5.80 bits) is less than reported (6.59 bits) in the
earlier study [6]. The diﬀerence in security is much higher
for cracking larger proportion of patterns, e.g., the security
of ﬁrst 50% of 3X3 patterns is 9.86 bits (less than three ran-
dom digits) while the security oﬀered by Pass-O patterns is
15.28 bits (more than four random digits).

As shown in Table 4, Pass-O defensive patterns are much
stronger than 3X3 defensive patterns. The eﬀort required
to crack the ﬁrst 20% of Pass-O patterns is 214.07−9.50 =
24.57 ≈ 23.75 times greater than that of 3X3 defensive pat-
terns (Table 4). Moreover, Pass-O defensive patterns are
also stronger by an order of magnitude than the defensive
patterns drawn on 4X4 grid [6] and Circle [13].
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an alternate circular layout
Pass-O which not only simpliﬁes the pattern drawing rules
but also improves the theoretical space and allows visually
complex patterns. We conducted a large-scale user study
and compared the security of 3X3 and Pass-O patterns. We
found that users do take advantage of circular layout and
create patterns with longer strokes and relatively large num-
ber of direction changes and intersections. Consequently,
a signiﬁcant fraction of the Pass-O patterns is classiﬁed as
strong by existing strength meters. Further, the search space
utilized by Pass-O patterns is much better than 3X3 pat-
terns. Consequently, the guessing resistance of Pass-O pat-
terns is also much higher.
Future Work. We found that Pass-O provides clear se-
curity improvements over 3X3 grid. However, due to the
web-based nature of the study, we could not compare the
usability of Pass-O and 3X3 patterns reliably. In future, we
intend to perform a focused usability study to determine any
resulting usability-security tradeoﬀ due to the use of Pass-O.
