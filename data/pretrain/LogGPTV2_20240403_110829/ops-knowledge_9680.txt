User: I have python code which asks user input. (e.g. src = input('Enter Path to src: ').          So when I  run code through command prompt (e.g. python test.py) prompt appears 'Enter path to src:'. But I want to type everything in one line (e.g. python test.py c:\users\desktop\test.py). What changes should I make? Thanks in advance
Assistant: You can use sys.argv[1] to get the first command line argument.  If you want more arguments, you can reference them with sys.argv[2], etc.
