`hyperkube` offers significant advantages in terms of reducing our
distribution size and simplifying the number of things that need to be
juggled. But some deployment scenarios are using separate binaries while
others are using `hyperkube`. We should switch everything over to `hyperkube`
and deprecate/remove the individual binaries.
Issues that need to be addressed before we can get there: #16410 #8772.
If we can agree on this being a good direction, I'm happy to chip in and do
the work.
