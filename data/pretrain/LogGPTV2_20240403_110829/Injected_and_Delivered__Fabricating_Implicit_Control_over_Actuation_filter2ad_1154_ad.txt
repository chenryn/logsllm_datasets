suddenly stop working and fall to the ground.
(3) Stabilizers. MEMS inertial sensors are widely used in
aiming and stabilizing systems. The goal of such systems
is to maintain a device or platform in a certain orientation
despite external forces or movements. Therefore, when
movements are detected by inertial sensors, the system
would actuate in opposite directions to cancel the effect
of external movements.
We evaluate our attacks on two camera stabilizers: a
DJI Osmo stabilizer and a Wenpod SP1 stabilizer. Our
results show that by spooﬁng the gyro and manipulating
the derived heading angle, the pointing direction of a sta-
bilizer could be controlled. However, fabricated heading
angles in X and Y axes will be gradually calibrated by
the system based on gravity information. As illustrated
1Precautions were used to ensure the safety of researchers.
Figure 11: An illustration of Switching attacks on a
stabilizer. The stabilizer tries to correct the fabricated
heading angle in Y-axis of the device by rotating to the
opposite direction. The attack is demonstrated in [13].
in Figure 11, we can use Switching attacks to induce a
maximum heading degree in the stabilizer. As the in-
duced heading angle increases, the calibration effect also
becomes stronger until the maximum heading angle is
reached.
Results. Both instances of stabilizers are vulnerable to
adversarial control through ultrasonic signals. The Osmo
stabilizer is mainly affected in X-axis while the Wenpod
stabilizer can only be manipulated in Y-axis of the de-
vice (which is the Z-axis based on the orientation of the
embedded inertial sensor). Our Side-Swing attacks and
Switching attacks on stabilizers are demonstrated in [8]
and [13].
(4) Anti-tremor Devices. Inertial sensors can be used by
anti-tremor gadgets in health-care applications, such as
gyroscopic tablewares and gloves [32] that mitigate hand
tremors and assist users to perform daily tasks. We eval-
uate acoustic attacks on a Liftware level handle and a
Gyenno gyroscopic spoon.
Results. The Liftware handle is vulnerable to DoS at-
tacks on its accelerometer. The handle under attacks
would abnormally actuate its motor to one direction and
become unusable. The Gyenno gyroscopic spoon is not
affected by acoustic signals.

Different from closed-loop systems that have a goal state,
open-loop control systems simply take inertial measure-
ments as inputs and actuate accordingly. We evaluate our
attacks on various types of devices that use real-time in-
ertial data for open-loop control. These devices use vari-
ous MEMS inertial sensors from different vendors. Nev-
ertheless, we ﬁnd that most of them could be susceptible
to implicit control.
(1) 3D mouses. Inertial sensors can be used in input de-
vices for remote control. 3D mouses use gyros to detect
a user’s hand movements and move the cursor accord-
ingly. We evaluate our spooﬁng attacks on an IOGear
3D mouse and a Ybee 3D mouse.
Results. Both instances of 3D mouse are vulnerable to
adversarial control through ultrasonic signals. By spoof-
ing the gyroscope, attackers could point the cursor of the
3D mouse in a remote system to different targets. We
demonstrate Side-Swing attacks and Switching attacks
on 3D mouses in [4] and [9].
(2) Gyroscopic screwdrivers. The gyroscopic screw-
driver is an industrial application that controls a mechan-
ical system based on inertial measurements. The moving
direction and speed of the motor in the screwdriver is de-
cided by the heading angle derived from gyroscope data.
In gyroscopic screwdrivers, there is usually no mech-
anism to calibrate the heading angle. Therefore, the in-
duced heading angle will not be eliminated even when
the attack ceases. Based on this feature, we adjust our at-
tack method to Conservative Side-Swing Attacks. The
basic idea is that attackers emit acoustic signals only
when changing the direction or speed of the motor. Once
the motor is tricked to move with a desired speed in the
target direction, attackers can turn off acoustic signals
to keep the heading angle in the system, as illustrated
in Figure 12. We evaluate our attacks on an E-design
ES120 screwdriver, a B&D gyroscopic screwdriver, and
a Dewalt gyroscopic screwdriver.
Results. By spooﬁng the gyro and manipulate the de-
rived heading angle, both the moving direction and speed
of the motor in the ES120 screwdriver can be controlled.
The B&D screwdriver can be manipulated only after we
remove its external panel and the Dewalt screwdriver is
not affected by acoustic signals.
(3) VR/AR devices.
Inertial sensors are used by Vir-
tual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) headsets and kinetic
controllers to track the user’s movements and control vi-
sual information in an image system. The user’s view
in VR systems or the position of augmented information
displayed in AR systems is often determined by heading
angles of the headset.
In addition, the movements de-

attacks on a screwdriver. Both the moving direction and
speed of the motor can be manipulated by spooﬁng the
gyroscope. The attack is demonstrated in [2].
tected by the kinetic controller will directly be used to
control an object in the image system. We evaluate our
attacks on an Oculus Rift VR headset, an Oculus Touch
controller, and a Microsoft Hololens AR headset.
Results. By spooﬁng the gyros with ultrasonic signals,
the user’s view in Oculus Rift headset and the orientation
of an object controlled by Oculus Touch can both be ma-
nipulated in X-axis. The Hololens headset can only be
affected very slightly by our sound source. Our Switch-
ing attacks on VR devices are demonstrated in [10] and
[14]. Recent researches have shown that buggy or ma-
liciously exploited visual information in an immersive
environment might startle or mislead a user and cause
unexpected consequences [50, 51]. Furthermore, a few
prototype products use AR applications to assist critical
real-world tasks [33, 31], and plenty of studies utilize in-
ertial measurements to remotely control mechanical sys-
tems such as a robotic arm [38]. Our experimental results
might help designers of these rapidly emerging applica-
tions to be aware of potential threats that might be caused
by spooﬁng inertial sensors.
(4) Smartphones. Smartphones have become a platform
that provides sensor data and computation resource for
large amounts of applications.
Inertial sensor data of
smartphones is often used in mobile VR/AR applications
and navigation systems. We evaluate our attacks on six
smartphones in different models. Both iOS and Android
devices are tested.
Results. The smartphones we test have different gyro-
scopes, which have different resonant frequency ranges.
While their sensitivity to resonant sound differs, we ﬁnd
that all of them are vulnerable to adversarial control. Our
Side-Swing attacks and Switching attacks on mobile VR
applications are demonstrated in [7] and [12]. In the de-
mos, we manipulate the VR user’s view and aim several
targets by spooﬁng the gyroscopic sensor.
(5) Motion-aware devices. Using inertial sensors to de-
tect motions is a popular wake-up mechanism in smart
devices. This mechanism can also be used to control

critical functions of an embedded system. The Pro32 sol-
dering iron uses an accelerometer to detect movements.
If there is no movement for a long time, the system will
cool down the iron tip and go into the sleep mode. This
protects the iron from overheating and reduces the risk
of accidental injuries or ﬁre. However, we ﬁnd that this
mechanism could be compromised by resonant acoustic
interferences. Our experiments show that attackers can
wake the Pro32 soldering iron up from the sleep mode
through DoS attacks on the accelerometer, and make the
iron tip heat up to a high working temperature repeti-
tively. The attack is demonstrated in [3].
7 Automatic Attack
In this section, we present a novel automatic attack
method and implement a proof-of-concept spooﬁng at-
tack on a mobile navigation system. We ﬁnd that in both
iOS and Android smartphones, inertial sensor data can
be accessed through a script in a web page or an applica-
tion without any permission. In our scope, a key question
is: Can an attack program facilitate spooﬁng attacks on
inertial sensors by leveraging the real-time sensor data?
To answer this question, we investigate automatic meth-
ods to implement Switching attacks.
Automatic Method. In automatic attacks, the attack pro-
gram modulates acoustic signals automatically based on
parameters set by the attacker. These parameters include
initial sound frequencies, threshold, target direction, etc.
The attacker can set the initial sound frequencies F1 and
F2 based on the real-time feedback of the sensor. The
threshold is used by the attack program to decide when
to switch the sound frequency. During attacks, the at-
tacker can send commands to the program to change the
target direction, to stop or restart the attack.
The attack program monitors the output of the sensor
and switches the frequency of acoustic signals between
F1 and F2 when the induced signal drops to the opposite
direction and falls below a threshold. However, we ﬁnd
that this setting only allows the program to attack auto-
matically for one or two minutes. After two minutes,
the integer multiple of the sensor’s sample rate might fall
outside (F1, F2) because of drifts in FS and the condition
of phase pacing (ε1 · ε2  0, we have,
F1 − ε1 = n0 ˆFS = F2 − ε2
After adaptation, we would have,
ˆF1 + ε2−ε1
2 = n0 ˆFS = ˆF2 − ε2−ε1
2
Therefore,
∆F = ˆF1 − F1 = ˆF2 − F2 = − ε1+ε2
Since ε2 − ε1 = F2 − F1, we have,
2(ε2−ε1) (ε2 − ε1)
where r =

∆F = r−1

ertial sensor data are necessary. Devices should control
the access to the sensor data. In addition, when a remote
autonomous agent transmits real-time inertial sensor data
for navigation purposes, the data should be encrypted.

It is important to protect control systems from sensor

much expenses in cost and size or compromises in de-
