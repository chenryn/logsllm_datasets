An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is 
an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. 
Motivation

disaster monitoring, and delivery businesses
Motivation
After the devastating earthquake and the following disastrous tsunami in Fukushima, Japan in 
2011, a Honey-well T-Hawk UAV equipped with special radiation sensors was used to 
investigate the reconnaissance missions for the reactor, where humans could not approach [1].

Introduction
Core ideas
‚Ä¢ Out-of-band location verification. 
‚Ä¢ Compare historical satellite images with real-time aerial images from its 
cameras.
‚Ä¢ Detect GPS spooÔ¨Ång attacks by analyzing the similarity metric between 
satellite imagery and aerial photography with deep learning.
Advantages
‚Ä¢ Easy to deploy.
‚Ä¢ No modifications on existing GPS infrastructure.
‚Ä¢ Detect attacks on-board while flying.

System Design of DeepSIM
Attacker model
‚Ä¢ An attacker can send fake GPS signals to UAVs by injecting, modifying, 
replaying, or delaying GPS signals.

Attacker model
‚Ä¢ The attacker may also block or jam the communication channel between the 
UAV and the ground station by active signal transmissions on the frequency 
channel used for communication.

Experimental results
Experiment and Evaluation
Average running time (left) and attack probability by different 
deviations (right) of the On-ground and On-board models. 
The results indicate the estimated probabilities of spoofing 
attacks become higher as the deviations increase.
