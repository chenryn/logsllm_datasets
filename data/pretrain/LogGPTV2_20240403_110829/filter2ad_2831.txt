## Abstract
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. This paper introduces DeepSIM, a method for detecting GPS spoofing attacks on UAVs by comparing satellite imagery with real-time aerial images captured by the UAV's cameras.

## Motivation
### Applications of UAVs
UAVs are widely used in various applications such as aerial surveillance, military reconnaissance, cadastral surveying, disaster monitoring, and delivery services. For example, after the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a Honeywell T-Hawk UAV equipped with special radiation sensors was deployed to investigate the reactor site where human access was impossible [1].

### Security Concerns
GPS spoofing is a significant security threat to UAVs. Incidents like the Iran–U.S. RQ-170 incident highlight the vulnerability of UAVs to such attacks [2]. Simulated GPS spoofing attacks can mislead a UAV to report a false location, leading to potential catastrophic consequences.

## Introduction
### Core Ideas
- **Out-of-band location verification:** DeepSIM uses historical satellite images and real-time aerial images from the UAV's cameras to verify the UAV's location.
- **Image comparison:** The system detects GPS spoofing by analyzing the similarity between satellite imagery and real-time aerial photography using deep learning techniques.

### Advantages
- **Ease of deployment:** No modifications to existing GPS infrastructure are required.
- **On-board detection:** The system can detect attacks while the UAV is in flight.
- **Flexibility:** DeepSIM can operate in both on-ground and on-board modes.

## Methodology
### Underlying Concept
DeepSIM compares the real-time aerial images with historical satellite images to detect discrepancies that indicate GPS spoofing. If the images do not match, it suggests a possible spoofing attack.

### Challenges
- **Rotation:** Differences in the orientation of the images.
- **Zoom levels:** Variations in the zoom level (eye altitude) of the images.
- **Ephemeral objects:** Temporary objects that may appear in one image but not the other.
- **Temporal differences:** Changes over time between the historical and real-time images.

### Dataset
The SatUAV dataset includes aerial photographs taken from different UAVs, such as the eBee and DJI Phantom 4 Advance. The dataset is calibrated to ensure accurate image pairing.

### System Design
#### Attacker Model
- **Spoofing attacks:** An attacker can send fake GPS signals to the UAV by injecting, modifying, replaying, or delaying legitimate GPS signals.
- **Jamming attacks:** The attacker can also block or jam the communication channel between the UAV and the ground station.

#### Neural Network Architecture
- **On-ground Model:**
  - Backbone: ResNet34
  - Layers: Fully Connected (FC), Batch Normalization (BN), ReLU, Dropout (DO), Parametric ReLU (PReLU)
- **On-board Model:**
  - Backbone: SqueezeNet
  - Layers: Convolutional (Conv_1*1), FC, BN, ReLU, DO, PReLU

#### Siamese Network
DeepSIM uses a Siamese network with a contrastive loss function to compare the similarity between the satellite and aerial images.

## Experimental Results
### Evaluation
- **Average running time:** The on-ground and on-board models were evaluated for their average running times.
- **Attack probability:** The estimated probabilities of spoofing attacks increase with the deviation from the true location.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the robustness of the models.

### Generalization Ability
The models were tested on a UK dataset (Birmingham, Coventry, Liverpool, and Peak District). The on-ground model achieved an accuracy of 0.888 (F1 score 0.889), and the on-board model achieved an accuracy of 0.841 (F1 score 0.872).

## Discussion
### Post-Detection Countermeasures
- **Fly out of the GPS spoofing area.**
- **Land in the current position.**
- **Return to home automatically.**

## Conclusion
- **Dataset:** A pioneering dataset of satellite-aerial image pairs.
- **DeepSIM:** A GPS spoofing-detection approach for UAVs via satellite imagery matching.
- **Prototype:** A prototype of the DeepSIM system.
- **Operation Modes:** The system can operate in both on-ground and on-board modes.
