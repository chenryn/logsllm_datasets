To align with the principle of least privilege, organizations should restrict permissions for deleting new instances. Specifically, the number of users with administrative privileges in Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles should be minimized. Additionally, efforts should be made to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments. Regular entitlement reviews of IAM users, roles, and policies are also recommended to ensure that access controls remain appropriate and up-to-date.
