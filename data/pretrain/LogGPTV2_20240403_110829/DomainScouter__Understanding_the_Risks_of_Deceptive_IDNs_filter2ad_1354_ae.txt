erty Organization (WIPO), one such service provider, handled
over 73,000 cases from 1999 to 2017 and successfully trans-
ferred the rights to rightsholders [65, 66]. A case ﬁled with
the WIPO is normally concluded within two months. The
Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS) [60], which com-
plements the UDRP, provides rightsholders with a quick and
a low-cost process to take down squatted domain names. The
fees of the URS start from almost $1,000 less than those of
the UDRP ($1,500 [49]). The identiﬁed invalid domain names
are suspended by the registry within two or three weeks; how-
ever, they are not deleted or transferred to the rightsholders.
To counter deceptive IDNs, domain owners can select one of
the two services (the UDRS or the URS) by taking both the
urgency and the monetary costs into consideration.
7.4 Certiﬁcate Authority
Outreach efforts to spread HTTPS by security engineers, re-
searchers, and browser vendors made many large websites
serve HTTPS by default. The major browsers also require
HTTPS; e.g., Google Chrome started to mark all HTTP sites
as “not secure” in July 2018.
Certiﬁcate authorities (CAs) should not issue certiﬁcates to
suspicious domain names (websites) to protect end users from
deceptive IDNs. However, in reality, many CAs have issued
certiﬁcates to squatted domain names, including deceptive
IDNs [58]. The baseline requirement for the issuance and man-
agement of publicly trusted certiﬁcates published by the CA
Browser Forum [6] mentions that CAs should do additional
veriﬁcation activities for high-risk certiﬁcate requests. We
recommend that CAs accommodate the brand-protection poli-
cies and procedures that are followed by domain registrars. If
all responsible CAs proactively shared trademark information
similar to the TMCH, they would NOT issue certiﬁcates to
squatted domain names. In addition, CAs would be able to re-
voke certiﬁcates for the domain names that violate trademarks
if they received such claims from rightsholders. Domain own-
ers are able to explore certiﬁcates of squatted domain names
in the log server of certiﬁcate transparency [34] because all
CAs are now encouraged to submit new certiﬁcates to it. Many
responsible CAs receive claims from rightsholders.
8 Related Work
We summarize related research literature in terms of deceptive
IDNs and non-IDN squattings.
Deceptive IDNs. Gabrilovich and Gontmakher ﬁrst men-
tioned an IDN homograph attack using non-ASCII characters
in 2002 [14]. In 2006, Holgers et al. investigated a campus
network trafﬁc to ﬁnd eng-homo IDNs targeting the Alexa
top 500 [19]. As mentioned in Section 4, in 2018, Liu et
al. proposed an eng-homo IDN detection method using the
SSIM index between IDNs and brand domains [36]. Sawabe
et al. proposed using OCR-based similarities between non-
ASCII and ASCII characters [48]. In 2019, Le Pochat et al.
explored candidate IDNs that brand owners may want to regis-
ter [43]. Suzuki et al. developed a framework to identify IDN
homographs in an automated manner [53]. Whereas the above
studies focused mainly on eng-homo IDNs using a smaller
number of IDNs under a limited number of TLDs, our work
has advanced these studies by focusing on various deceptive
IDNs (e.g., eng-combo, eng-homocombo, noneng-combo, and
noneng-homocombo), analyzing more IDNs under almost all
TLDs, and studying the extent to which users are deceived by
deceptive IDNs.
Non-IDN Squattings. In addition to deceptive IDNs, many
previous studies analyzed a wide range of domain squatting
methods in non-IDN (ASCII) domains such as combosquat-
ting (combining brand name with keywords) [30], bit squat-
ting (accidental bit ﬂips) [41], and typosquatting (typographi-
cal errors) [1, 29, 55, 62].
9 Conclusion
This paper proposed a system called DOMAINSCOUTER to
detect deceptive internationalized domain names (IDNs) and
calculate the deceptive IDN score. We performed the most
comprehensive measurement study to show that (1) there
are many previously unexplored deceptive IDNs, (2) their
number has kept increasing since 2014, and (3) only 3.8%
of them are protected by their targeted brand owners. More-
over, we conducted online surveys to reveal that the majority
of users cannot recognize deceptive IDNs and conﬁrm that
the deceptive IDN score successfully reﬂects the tendency of
users to be deceived. To reduce the risk of deceptive IDNs,
we provided suggestions for client applications, domain reg-
istrars/registries, domain owners, and certiﬁcate authorities.
We hope that our results can be used to enable a secure and
multilingual Internet for all users.
