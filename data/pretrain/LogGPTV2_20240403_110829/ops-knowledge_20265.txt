User: I am trying to run a python script on my mac .I am getting the error :-

ImportError: No module named opengl.opengl

I googled a bit and found that I was missing pyopengl .I installed pip.I go to the directory pip-1.0 and then say 

sudo pip install pyopengl

and it installs correctly I believe because I got this 

Successfully installed   pyopengl Cleaning up...

at the end.
I rerun the script but i am still getting the same error .Can someone tell me what I might be missing?
Thanks!
Assistant: Thanks guys! I figured it out.It was infact a separate module which I needed to copy over to the "site-packages" location and it worked fine.So in summary no issues with the path just that the appropriate module was not there.
