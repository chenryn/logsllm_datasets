I was attempting to run a Python script on my Mac and encountered the following error:

```
ImportError: No module named opengl.opengl
```

After some research, I discovered that I was missing the `PyOpenGL` package. I installed `pip`, navigated to the `pip-1.0` directory, and executed the following command:

```bash
sudo pip install pyopengl
```

The installation seemed to complete successfully, as I received the message:

```
Successfully installed pyopengl
Cleaning up...
```

However, when I reran the script, I still encountered the same error. Can someone help me understand what might be missing?

**Update:**

Thank you for your assistance! I have resolved the issue. It turned out that I needed to copy a separate module to the `site-packages` directory. Once I did this, the script ran without any issues. In summary, the problem was not related to the path but rather the absence of the necessary module in the `site-packages` directory.
