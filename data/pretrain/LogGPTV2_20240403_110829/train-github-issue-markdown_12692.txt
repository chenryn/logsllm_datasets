We are using the custom `_error.js` page, and we're seeing an issue where
anything other than a `404` from a server error is rendering the error page
twice.
It looks like it's rendering once on the server (the render HTML only has 1
error page), but also rendering an _additional_ error page on the client.
I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if there is something wrong with the way
we're handling the error (we're letting next handle the uncaught error). Any
guidance would be appreciated.
I've created an example that replicates the issue here:
