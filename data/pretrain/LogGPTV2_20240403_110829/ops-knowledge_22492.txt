User: I have quite a lot of C++ legacy code modules from my colleagues, unfortunately poorly written. Each is doing a different job, but they are  all GNU C++ code running under Linux. 
I want to write a controller program, to make a singular C++ module for a workflow, for a very urgent demo. Also I need to write a front-end web-app allowing clients submitting jobs to the controller.  
My main criteria are:

development speed (very urgent demo)
good binding with C++ (I have legacy code I do not want to rewrite in another language)
smooth introduction of new programming language to team (has some python, java and perl knowledge)

What programming language fits my needs best, and why?
Details:
I lean towards python for its perfect binding with C++, as writing JNI is too much work, and kind of obsolete nowadays. However, no one in my team is Python programmer; I do know some Python (no experience in server side programming at all). I have been developing Java EE apps last year, but I do not think JNI is a good solution. Only one team member knows some Perl, others are pure C++ programmers.
Assistant: I would use Python. You could write very basic wrappers using the Python C API and then call said functions from Python with relative ease.
