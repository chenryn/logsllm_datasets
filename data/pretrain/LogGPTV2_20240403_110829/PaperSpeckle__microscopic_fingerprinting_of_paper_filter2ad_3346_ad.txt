distinguish ﬁngerprints.
5.2.3
We extracted 25 speckles from diﬀerent pieces of paper
and submerged the pieces of paper under water for a few
minutes. To make sure we extract speckle from the same re-
gion, we used UniBall 207 Gel pen to pigment the papers and
mark the region (special ink from the Uniball pen doesn’t
fade when a paper is soaked in water). After pigmenting the
papers, it was submerged in water for a few minutes. Fig-
ure 10f, shows the results of comparing “same” ﬁngerprints
(on the left) and “diﬀerent” ﬁngerprints (on the right). The
two distributions are well separated and the ﬁngerprints can
be distinguished with no false positives. For a single false
positive to occur, at least 5000 bits of a Gabor binary ma-
trix need to be modiﬁed. This shows that PaperSpeckle is
robust and is able to withstand extreme conditions such as
water soaking.
5.2.4 Aging
We extracted 50 speckles from diﬀerent pieces of paper
and stored it for around two years in a storage closet. Then,
we extracted the speckles from the same set of papers, gen-
erated the ﬁngerprints and compared them. The mean and
standard deviation for “same” ﬁngerprints is 1.52 and 1.61.
The mean and standard deviation for “diﬀerent” ﬁngerprints
is 87.56 and 12.98. For a single false positive to occur, at
least 10000 bits of a Gabor binary matrix need to be mod-
iﬁed. This shows that PaperSpeckle works on aged paper
without any false positives.
6. APPLICATIONS
PaperSpeckle can be used in a variety of ways where ver-
ifying the authenticity of a paper document is of utmost
importance.
The main beneﬁt of ﬁngerprints corresponding to a speckle
pattern is that the ﬁngerprint can be printed on the same
piece of paper containing the paper speckle. Any piece of
paper can be made self-veriﬁable by extracting the speckle
pattern from a small region on the paper and imprinting
the ﬁngerprint of the speckle pattern of the region in the

This self-veriﬁable paper can be used for oﬄine
veriﬁcation of paper documents.
Paper check, receipt or voucher is issued by a trusted au-
thority such as a Bank or Government Authority. The ﬁrst
step of the oﬄine authentication mechanism is the paper
check generation. The issuing authority is associated with a
cryptographic key pair K = (P, Q), where P is the public-
key and Q is the corresponding private-key. While Q is only
known to the trusted authority creating the oﬃcial paper
documents, P is known to any entity who wishes to authen-
ticate the paper document in an oﬄine manner. Given any
piece of paper, the issuing authority can convert the paper
into an authentic oﬄine veriﬁable paper document using the
following paper check generation steps.
i) Make the paper
self-veriﬁable by reading a region of the paper, extracting
the speckle mark M and imprinting the corresponding ﬁn-
gerprint D(M ) computed using any computing device with
an attached microscope. ii) The Bank signs D(M ) using its
private key Q. We denote this as SQ(D) and the bank prints
SQ(D) on the paper check. In practice, SQ(D) can be repre-
sented as a compact 2D barcode. iii) The paper check con-
tains three artifacts: speckle pattern M , ﬁngerprint D(M ),
signed number SQ(D). In practice, this can be extended to
authenticate any additional information T embedded such
as serial number (for currency notes, checks), transaction de-
tails or personal information. To achieve this, we can simply
replace SQ(D) with SQ(D, T ). To authenticate this paper
in an oﬄine manner, a mobile device (cellphone) equipped
with a microscope, extracts the speckle image M from the
region, generates the ﬁngerprint D(M )(cid:48) of the speckle M
and checks if generated ﬁngerprint D(M )(cid:48) matches D(M )
printed on the paper. (If D(M ) is represented as a 2-D bar-
code, then D(M ) is read using inbuilt camera in the mobile
device coupled with a standard barcode library). If the ﬁn-
gerprints do not match, the paper is a counterfeit. Else, if
the ﬁngerprints match, then it is guaranteed that the paper
is genuine. Once the paper is determined to be genuine, the
next step is to verify whether the ﬁngerprint was signed by
the trusted authority (bank). SQ(D) which is represented
as a 2D barcode is read using the barcode scanner in the
mobile device. Using the authentic public-key P stored in
the mobile device, it is checked if SQ(D) is a valid signature
of D(M ).
In a similar fashion, PaperSpeckle can be used to authenti-
cate currency notes, lottery tickets, land records, degree cer-
tiﬁcates, receipts in microﬁnance and in other areas where
the possession of paper is used as a primary record of own-
ership.
7. DISCUSSION
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss the robustness of Paper-
Speckle in the face of photocopying or fabrication of paper.
Photocopying paper: Photocopying paper will clearly
not preserve the speckle pattern in the original paper since
the microscopic region of the copied paper is inherently very
diﬀerent. In addition, the speckle region in a paper is in the
micrometer range. The ﬁeld of view of a microscope with
200x magniﬁcation is 2mm and each pixel in the image is
around 1-2 microns. Even the shape of the contour at a
microscopic level may be very diﬀerent in the photocopied
paper. This was observed by Zhu et. al. [31] where they
state that due to the halftoning eﬀects of the photocopy-
ing process, the shape of the contour would diﬀer from the
original one. To test this hypothesis, we photocopied 100
speckles and compared their ﬁngerprints. The results we
obtained were similar to the results we obtained for “diﬀer-
ent” ﬁngerprints in Section 5.
Fabrication of paper speckle: Pappu [24] discusses
some of the current 3D fabrication techniques. Fabricat-
ing paper using photolithography techniques is an expensive
process usually in the order of hundreds of millions of dol-
lars [24]. Also, these processes manufacture large number
of identical structures and they are not economically suited
for producing just one cloned copy of a single microscopic
paper structure.
Optical scattering based systems are hard to copy/clone
for two reasons [28]. i) The light diﬀusion obscures the loca-
tion of the scatterers (scatterers or scattering elements, are
particles that scatter light in an object). The state-of-the-
art techniques can probe strong diﬀusive materials only up
to a depth of 10 scattering lengths (scattering of light be-
tween particles). ii) Even if we know the position of the all
scatterers, the precise positioning of large number of scat-
tering elements is very expensive.
Even the forward problem is hard. Given the details of all
the scattering elements, computing or simulating the speckle
pattern is computationally expensive where the complex-
ity increases exponentially with the number of scattering
events [28].
Destroying a speckle pattern: The simplest manner
to destroy a speckle pattern is to scratch the speckled region
with a sharp object that destroys the surface characteristics
of the region of interest. Alternatively, the speckled region
can be excessively scribbled upon (using a pen or pencil)
thereby changing the boundary speciﬁcation of a speckled
region or one can tear the piece of paper at exactly the
speckled spot. Any of these techniques have to be precise
since the speckled region is typically very small in diameter
(0.5 mm). To enhance the robustness of PaperSpeckle in the
face of inadvertent incidents, a simple approach is to speckle
a piece of paper at multiple points coupled with their corre-
sponding self-veriﬁable compact codes of each of the speckle
regions. A determined adversary who wishes to destroy a
speckled piece of paper has to destroy each of the speckle
points in the piece of paper which would essentially render
the paper useless.
8. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have presented PaperSpeckle, a low-cost,
robust, portable paper ﬁngerprinting system that can iden-
tify and authenticate paper. The key contributions of the
paper can be summarized as follows. We show how to ex-
tract repeatable texture speckle patterns from a region of
paper and present an algorithm to generate ﬁngerprint from
a region of paper. We provide detailed evaluation of our ﬁn-
gerprinting algorithm across diﬀerent types of paper and also
show how our system is robust against tampering by evalu-
ating texture speckles in adverse environmental conditions.
We implement the ﬁngerprinting mechanism on a cellphone
and discuss how our system can be used in an oﬄine man-
ner, which has a high potential in mitigating forgery and
enhancing physical security of paper in developing regions.
