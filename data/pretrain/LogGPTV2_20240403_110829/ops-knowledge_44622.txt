User: How to create a highly available distributed cache system? Please describe your design thinking.
Assistant: To create a high-availability distributed cache system, you need to consider the following design ideas: 1. Architecture design First, you should decide what architecture to use. Common distributed cache architectures include master-slave architecture, P2P architecture, and centralized architecture. Among them, the master-slave architecture can ensure the consistency of data, the P2P architecture can improve the availability of the system, and the centralized architecture can reduce the pressure of network transmission data. The specific architecture design should be selected according to business requirements, existing technology stack, data type, and distributed deployment nodes. 2. Data consistency In a distributed environment, data consistency is very important. If the data of a node is inconsistent with the master data, it will cause anomalies in the system data. In order to solve this problem, we can use the master-slave backup mechanism of the cache server to ensure the consistency of node data, and we can also use distributed locks to control concurrent data modification operations. 3. Load balancing Load balancing refers to distributing client request traffic to multiple cache nodes, and implementing different business logic on different nodes, thereby improving the performance and availability of the entire system. It can be implemented by using a hardware load balancer or a software load balancer. Commonly used software load balancers include Nginx, HAProxy, etc. 4. Multi-copy backup In order to prevent data loss and node downtime, we should have multiple copy backups. When a node fails, backup data can be obtained from other nodes to ensure data integrity and availability. This data backup method can adopt multi-copy synchronous or asynchronous data backup. 5. Monitoring and management The distributed cache system is characterized by complexity and high reliability. In order to ensure the stability and security of the system, monitoring and management is required. We need to monitor the cache system, including node status, CPU load, memory usage, network traffic, etc. You can use some monitoring tools to monitor and manage cache nodes, such as Zabbix, Nagios, etc. The above is the basic design idea. Based on the existing caching products such as Redis, the functions are extended again, and appropriate technical solutions and products are selected, and the technology is flexibly used to load services in various scenarios to expand the performance and availability of the system.
