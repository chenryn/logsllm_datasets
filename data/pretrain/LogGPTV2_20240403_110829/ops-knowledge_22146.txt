**Introduction:**
I am new to Python, Wing IDE, and Google Cloud applications. I have been attempting to configure Wing IDE to pause at breakpoints in a local (Windows 7) Google App Engine environment. I am using the provided guestbook demo application, which launches and functions as expected in the web browser.

**Issue:**
However, breakpoints are not being triggered. Upon starting the debugger, I receive the following status message:
```
Debugger: Debug process running; pid=xxxx; Not listening (too many connections) ...
```

**Configuration:**
My run arguments are set according to the recommendations in the Wing IDE help file section "Using Wing IDE with Google App Engine":
```
C:\x\guestbook --max_module_instances=1 --threadsafe_override=false
```

**Additional Observations:**
- When I follow the instructions to go into Project Properties and the Debug/Execute tab to set "Debug Child Processes" to "Always Debug Child Process," I find that this option is not available.
- In the guestbook application, if I press the pause button, the code breaks, usually in the `wait` method of the `threading.py` file, which seems logical.
- Breakpoints work correctly in a generic console application created within Wing IDE.

**Environment:**
- **Wing IDE Version:** 5.1.9-1 (Personal Edition)
- **Python Path:** I have included the Google App Engine directory and the guestbook directories in the Python path.

**Additional Issue:**
- `sys.stdout.write` strings are not appearing in the Debug I/O window.

**Resolution:**
To resolve the breakpoint issue, I copied the `wingdbstub.py` file (from the Wing IDE debugger packages) into the project directory and added the line `import wingdbstub` at the beginning of my script. This allowed me to successfully debug the modules.
