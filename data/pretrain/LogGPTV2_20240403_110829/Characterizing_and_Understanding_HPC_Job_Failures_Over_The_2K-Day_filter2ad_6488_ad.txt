(Takeaway 11): The fraction of the three most frequent exit
codes (“TO,” ‘Bug,” and “Kill”) are relatively consistent
across different numbers of nodes; in contrast, the “RS”
exit code exhibits a higher chance on relatively large
numbers of nodes used per job (the most error-prone
execution scales are 12,288 nodes and 32,768 nodes), in
that larger execution scale involves more resources.
(a) Exit Code Based on # of Nodes (b) Exit Code Based on Queue Name
Fig. 7. Exit Code Distribution Based on # of Nodes and Queue Name (We
use abbreviations to denote queue names; full names are in Table XIII.)
By contrast, as shown in Fig. 7(b), we have the following
takeaway. (Takeaway 12): The exit code distribution ex-
hibits a very high diversity across different queues, because
different queues are created to hold speciﬁc groups of jobs
with similar features. The jobs in the prod-1024-torus (prodt)
queue, for example, likely have bugs, according to the ﬁgure.
The failed jobs belonging to prod-long are likely because of
“timeout” issues. More detailed correlations can be observed in
the contingency table in terms of the queue name vs. exit code
(Table XIII). For instance, the prod-short queue deals mainly
with the relatively short jobs, so it involves the most jobs on
each exit code; SC13 prep is a particular queue reserved for
the research prepared for the SC13 conference, so it has a
small number of jobs (Table XIII).
4) Features Based on Job Queuing/Execution Length: In
Fig. 8 we characterize the distribution (CDF) of all jobs’
queuing/execution length. Based on this, we formulate the
following takeaway. (Takeaway 13): Most jobs request a
(a) Consecutive Tasks
(b) Multilocation Tasks
Fig. 6. Exit Code Distribution Based on Consecutive/Multilocation Tasks
node blocks, while exit codes “SI” and “ST” exhibit higher
frequency on the 512-node blocks. This feature can also be
veriﬁed by the contingency table based on the number of nodes
(as shown in Table XII). However, the correlation is hardly
observed on the same-size blocks (such as xxxxx-yyyyy-8192)
especially for the high-frequency exit codes (such as “NM”
and “TO”), indicating that the user-behavior based job failures
are not correlated with locality. This observation is consistent
with our χ2 signiﬁcance test, where the χ2 statistic of the
locations vs. exit code in the table is far greater than the
99.9%-conﬁdence-level threshold (437 vs. 126), but the χ2
values of the same-size locations with exit codes are lower
than the χ2 thresholds, meaning that exit codes cannot be
thought of as correlated with the same-block-size locations.
In Table XI, for example, the χ2 value of all 512-node blocks
is 64.6, which is lower than the χ2 threshold (80.1).
