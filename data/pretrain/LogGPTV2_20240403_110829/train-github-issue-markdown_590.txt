I wrote a program to watch an incoming files in inbox folder and it's working
fine, except some garbage shows on the screen, however, this works fine one
Windows 10. I used the following code:
import { green, magenta, red, bold, underline } from
"https://deno.land/std/fmt/colors.ts";  
const success = (text: string) => {  
console.log(green(bold(text)));  
}
success(`Watching the folder: C:/OpenAS2/data/inbox`);
Shows the attached image.
