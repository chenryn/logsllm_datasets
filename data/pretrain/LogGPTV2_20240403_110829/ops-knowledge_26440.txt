User: How is it possible to get a compiled .exe program written in Python to kill itself after a period of time after it is launched?
If I have some code and I compile it into an .exe, then launch it and it stays in a 'running' or 'waiting' state, how can I get it to terminate after a few mins regardless of what the program is doing?
The reason why is that the exe that is launched envokes a URL using PAMIE and automates some clicks. What I have noticed is that if the browser is closed the process remains in memory and does not clean itself up. I wanted to find a way to auto-clean up the process after say 5 mins which is more then enough time. I've tried using psutils to detect the process but that does not work in my case. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated.
Assistant: Create a thread when your process starts.
Make that thread sleep for the required duration.
When that sleep is over, kill the process.
