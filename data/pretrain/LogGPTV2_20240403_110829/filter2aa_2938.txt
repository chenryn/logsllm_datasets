### Home Detention Systems
Home detention systems are used to monitor 'low-risk' criminals in their homes. Examples include:
- A woman sentenced to home detention in an immigration scheme (Los Angeles, October 2014).
- A private investigator who hacked emails and was sentenced to 3 months in jail and 6 months of home detention (New York, June 2015).

### How Home Detention Systems Work
- **Older Systems**: Rely on phone lines and RF (radio frequency) for anklet bracelet proximity.
- **Newer Systems**: Utilize GPS, cellular networks, and short-range RF.

### In America
- According to James Kilgore (2012), approximately 200,000 people in the U.S. wear a black plastic box (anklet) as part of home detention.
- It is challenging to obtain detailed information about these systems.
- I obtained a 'sample' unit from a Taiwan manufacturing company (GWG International Inc.) for around $1,000 through social engineering.
- Different states and police forces use different trackers, making it difficult to determine the exact usage of this unit in the U.S.
- Other trackers likely share similar vulnerabilities.
- Detailed manuals were lacking, but I found a car tracking system (GS-818 by SAN JOSE TECHNOLOGY, INC) running the same operating system.

### Getting Hold of One
- **Operation**: The system uses GPS for location, a home base unit with short-range RF, and tamper detection.
- **Battery Life**: Depends on configuration and can be recharged without removing the anklet.
- **Base Unit**: Has a battery to handle power outages and communicates over SMS or GPRS (TCP socket) with a server.
- **Commands**: The system accepts commands to change settings such as username, password, network APN, SMS-TCP mode, SMS numbers, status report interval, geo-fence coordinates, buzzer, vibration alert, log to file settings, clear log, fiber optic break detection, and reed switch detection.

### The System – Base Unit
- **Internals Teardown**:
  - **Anklet**: Contains a JTAG header, Cinterion MC551, K9F5608U0D, vibration motor, M430F5418, and a 434.01 MHz module.
  - **Operation**: The system supports various commands and features, including setting usernames, passwords, network APNs, SMS-TCP modes, SMS numbers, status report intervals, geo-fence coordinates, buzzers, vibration alerts, log to file settings, clear logs, fiber optic break detection, and reed switch detection.

### GSM Security
- **Encryption**: GSM is encrypted using A5/1, A5/2, or A5/3.
- **Authentication**: The Ki embedded in the SIM card is used to authenticate the SIM, but the network is not authenticated, which is a known issue.
- **Temporary Key**: Kc is a temporary key used to encrypt traffic.
- **Unique ID**: The IMEI is used as a unique identifier, while the phone number is known only by the network, not the SIM.

### SDR (Software Defined Radio)
- **BladeRF and YateBTS**: Open-source GSM stack based on OpenBTS, allowing JavaScript scripts to control network functions.
- **Spoofing Network**: Can be used to spoof a real network. You need to find the MCC/MNC of local telcos, which is illegal.
- **Faraday Cage**: A simple Faraday cage (e.g., a roll of tin foil) can block real telco signals and encourage the device to connect to a rogue network.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **TCP Mode**: If the system is in TCP mode, MitM attacks are relatively easy.
- **SMS Mode**: If in SMS mode, MitM attacks are more challenging but still possible.

### Intercepting Status Messages
- **Example Message**: `#username, $GPRMC,110834.902,V,3750.580,S,14459.1854,E,0.00,0.00,141014,,*07,ST-1-M27-0-3885mV-50.0`
- **Components**:
  - `#username`: Used for authentication.
  - `$GPRMC...*07`: NMEA standard for GPS data, including coordinates and timestamp.
  - `*07`: Hex checksum for GPS data.
  - `ST-1-M27-0-3885mV-50.0`: Includes RF beacon code, charging status, and possibly message type, battery charge, and local cell towers.

### Spoofing SMS
- **Providers**: Many providers offer SMS spoofing services, costing around 30 cents per SMS.
- **smsgang.com**: We will use this service.
- **Number Acquisition**: Three methods to get the number: pulling the SIM card, brute-forcing the PIN, and using Kraken rainbow tables.

### Brute Forcing the PIN
- **Default PIN**: 0000, start with a dictionary attack.
- **Status Messages**: Drop status messages and let the anklet retransmit on the real network.
- **Full Control**: Once the PIN is found, you have full control of the device. Change the configuration to send status to a phone you control.
- **Mathematics**: The PIN must be 4 characters long, using letters and numbers. This results in 1,679,616 possible combinations. At a rate of 30 SMS messages per minute, it would take around 39 days to try every possible PIN.

### Kraken Rainbow Tables
- **Karsten Nohl (BlackHat 2010)**: Allows reversing the Kc of GSM traffic captured using SDR.
- **Decryption**: Once Kc is known, you can decrypt SMS, GPRS, and voice traffic.
- **Forgery**: Send forged messages to your own phone to get the number.
- **Limitations**: Cannot stop real messages, but if you have a Faraday cage and two SDRs, you can snoop commands and get the PIN.

### Live Demo
- **Assumptions**: Assume we have the anklet number from one of the attacks described.
- **Setup**: Use a Faraday cage and spoof the network.
- **Process**:
  - Decode the message.
  - Replace latitude and longitude.
  - Recalculate the checksum and encode.
  - Script a POST request to the SMS spoof service.
  - Use Google Maps to visualize points: green for delivered to the phone, red for captured by the spoofed network.

### RF Base Unit
- **Frequency**: 434.01 MHz.
- **Modulation**: Frequency Shift Keying (FSK).
- **Heartbeat**: Beacon every 10 seconds.

### Possible Attacks
- **Static Heartbeat**: Does not change until rebooted (unknown if unique to each device).
- **Record and Replay**: Record the base station heartbeat with an SDR and replay it.

### Black Hat
- **Warning**: Do not use this information in the real world. You will face severe legal consequences.

### System Detection
- **War Driving**: Scan for base unit RF beacons.
- **Expensive and Slow**: Unless you can detect RF from a long range. It is better to use court documents and newspapers to get names and dox.
- **Jamming**: Jam the base station, cell, and GPS signals (cheap and easy but very illegal).
- **Spoofing and Brute Forcing**: Spoof the real network, brute force the PIN, take control of the anklet, impersonate the user, crack Kc, get the number, jam the real device, and spoof fake coordinates.

### Monetization
- **Blackmail**: If people break the rules of their sentence, they normally go to jail. You could potentially blackmail users.
- **Sell Services**: Sell spoofing devices or services.
- **Cyber Hits**: Perform 'cyber hits' on people for a fee.

### Summary
- **Issues**: Home detention systems have several security issues.
- **Improvements**: Could be improved with mutual authentication and encryption.
- **Challenges**: Jamming and user locating are hard to mitigate.
- **Future Research**:
  - Try to execute code from malformed SMS.
  - Remove IC, dump ROM, and look for bugs/backdoors.
  - Write software emulators for the anklet.
  - Use SDR to spoof GPS.
