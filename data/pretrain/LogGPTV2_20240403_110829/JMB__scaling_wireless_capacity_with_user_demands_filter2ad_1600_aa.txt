ABSTRACT
We present joint multi-user beamforming (JMB), a system that en-
ables independent access points (APs) to beamform their signals, and
communicate with their clients on the same channel as if they were
one large MIMO transmitter. The key enabling technology behind
JMB is a new low-overhead technique for synchronizing the phase
of multiple transmitters in a distributed manner. The design allows
a wireless LAN to scale its throughput by continually adding more
APs on the same channel. JMB is implemented and tested with both
software radio clients and off-the-shelf 802.11n cards, and evaluated
in a dense congested deployment resembling a conference room. Re-
sults from a 10-AP software-radio testbed show a linear increase in
network throughput with a median gain of 8.1 to 9.4×. Our results
also demonstrate that JMB’s joint multi-user beamforming can pro-
vide throughput gains with unmodiﬁed 802.11n cards.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless spectrum is limited; wireless demands can, however,
grow unlimited. Busy Wi-Fi networks, for instance, in conference
rooms, hotels, and enterprises are unable to keep up with user de-
mands [40, 16], even causing high proﬁle failures like the wireless
network collapse during the Steve Jobs iPhone 4 keynote. Cellular
networks are in a similar predicament, with their demands forecast to
exceed available capacity within the next few years [32]. This is not
for lack of improvement in the performance of wireless devices. In-
deed, individual wireless devices have improved dramatically in re-
cent years through innovations like the introduction of multi-antenna
systems, better hardware, and lower receiver noise. The problem
however is that there is a mismatch between the way user demands
scale and network throughput scales; user demands scale with the
number of devices in the network but network throughput does not.
Unless network throughput also scales with the number of devices,
wireless networks will always ﬁnd it hard to keep up with their de-
mands, and the projected demands will keep exceeding the projected
capacity.

Figure 1: Traditional vs. Joint Multi-User Beamforming. In a
traditional multi-user beamforming system with multiple 2 antenna
APs, only 1 AP can transmit on a given channel at any given time.
This leads to a maximum of 2 simultaneous packet transmissions
regardless of the total number of APs. In contrast, JMB enables all
APs to transmit on the same channel, allowing up to 2N simultane-
ous packet transmissions if there are N 2-antenna APs.
In this paper, we present a system that enables a network to scale
its throughput with the number of transmitting devices. We focus
on the scenario of typical busy wireless environments such as mul-
tiple users in a conference room, enterprise, hotel etc. We enable a
wireless LAN to keep increasing its total throughput by continuously
adding more access points (APs) on the same channel.
The key technical idea behind our system is joint multi-user beam-
forming (JMB). Multi-user beamforming is a known technique that
enables a MIMO transmitter to deliver multiple independent streams
(i.e., packets) to receivers that have fewer antennas, as shown in
Fig. 1(a), where a 2-antenna access point delivers two packets con-
currently to two single antenna receivers. In contrast, as shown in
Fig. 1(b), JMB enables multiple access points on the same chan-
nel to deliver their packets concurrently to multiple receivers, with-
out interfering with each other. This system scales network through-
put with the number of devices, and delivers as many concurrent
streams/packets as the total number of antennas on all APs. Further-
more, it can leverage the continuing performance and reliability im-
provements of individual devices (e.g., more antennas per device).
The main challenge in implementing JMB stems from the need to
synchronize the phases of distributed transmitters. Speciﬁcally, the
goal of beamforming is to ensure that each client can decode its in-
tended signal without interference. Thus, at each client, the signals
intended for the other clients have to cancel each other out. This
requires the transmitters to control the relative phases of their trans-
mitted signals so that the desired cancellation can be achieved. Such
a requirement is naturally satisﬁed in the case of a single device per-
forming multi-user beamforming. However, in the case of JMB, the
transmitters have independent oscillators, which are bound to have
differences in their carrier frequencies. If one simply tries to jointly
beamform these independent signals from different transmitters, the
drift between their oscillators will make the signals rotate at differ-
ent speeds relative to each other, causing the phases to diverge and
hence preventing beamforming.

the frequency offset (i.e., the drift) ∆ω between the transmitters, and
compensate for the beamforming phase errors as ∆φ = ∆ωt, where
t is the elapsed time. However, such an approach is not practical. It
is well known [1, 36, 15] that frequency offset estimates have errors
due to noise, and using such estimates to compute phases causes
rapidly accumulating errors over time. Even a small error of, say,
10 Hz (4×10−3 ppm, which is several orders of magnitude smaller
than the mandated 802.11 tolerance of 20 ppm, or cellular tolerance
of 1-2 ppm), can lead to a large error of 20 degrees (0.35 radians)
within a short time interval of 5.5 ms. Such a large error in the phase
of the beamformed signals will cause signiﬁcant interference at the
receivers, preventing them from decoding.
JMB presents a simple and practical approach for synchronizing
the phases of multiple distributed transmitters. The key idea under-
lying JMB is to elect one of the APs as a lead and use its phase
as a reference for the whole system. Other APs (i.e., the slaves) di-
rectly measure the phase of the lead AP and change the phase of
their signals to maintain a desired alignment with respect to the lead.
In particular, JMB precedes every data packet with a couple of sym-
bols transmitted by the lead AP. The slave APs use these symbols
to directly measure the required phase correction for proper beam-
forming. Since this is a direct phase measurement as opposed to a
prediction based on frequency offsets, it has no accumulated errors.
After correcting for this phase error, the slave APs use the estimate
for their frequency offset to predict any phase changes throughout
the packet and correct for it. This bounds the maximum phase er-
ror accumulation to the duration of a packet. One can use a simple
long term average for the frequency offset to ensure that the phase
error accumulated for the duration of a packet is within the desired
performance bounds.
In the rest of the paper, we expand on this basic idea and demon-
strate that it can deliver accurate joint beamforming across dis-
tributed transmitters. Further, we also extend this idea to work with
off-the-shelf 802.11 cards. This would allow organizations to di-
rectly leverage JMB by simply upgrading their AP infrastructure,
without requiring any modiﬁcation to the clients.
We implemented JMB in two environments:
• The ﬁrst environment consists of USRP2 APs and receivers,
where both APs and clients can be modiﬁed. We use this environ-
ment to verify the scaling properties of JMB, and also to perform
ﬁner grained analysis of the individual components of JMB.
• The second environment consists of USRP2 APs and receivers
with Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 adapters. Each AP in this second
testbed consists of two USRP2s connected via an external clock
and conﬁgured to act as a 2-antenna MIMO AP. Correspondingly,
each receiver Wi-Fi card has 2 antennas enabled. We use this
testbed to verify that JMB can provide throughput gains with off-
the-shelf 802.11n cards, and further, that JMB can provide these
gains with multi-antenna devices.
We evaluated JMB in an indoor testbed using APs and receivers
deployed densely in a room to simulate a conference room scenario.
Our results reveal the following ﬁndings:
• USRP testbed: JMB’s throughput increases linearly with the
number of APs. In particular, in our testbed, which has 10 APs,
JMB can achieve a median throughput gain of 8.1 − 9.4× over
traditional 802.11 unicast, across the range of 802.11 SNRs.
• 802.11 testbed: JMB’s ability to linearly scale the network
throughput with the number of transmitters applies to off-the-
shelf 802.11 clients. Speciﬁcally, JMB can transmit simultane-
ously from two 2-antenna APs to two 2-antenna 802.11n clients to
deliver a median throughput gain of 1.8× compared to traditional
802.11n.
• Phase Synchronization: JMB’s distributed phase synchroniza-
tion algorithm is accurate. The 95th percentile misalignment be-
tween APs observed at the receiver is less than 0.05 radians. Fur-
ther, for the whole range of operational SNRs of 802.11 (5-25 dB),
the reduction in SNR at each client due to misalignment, (i.e., the
total power of interference from all signals not intended for this
client to the noise ﬂoor) increases on average by 0.13 dB for every
additional AP-client pair.
Contributions: This work presents the ﬁrst system that scales wire-
less throughput by enabling joint beamforming from distributed in-
dependent transmitters. To achieve this, we design a simple and prac-
tical approach for performing phase synchronization across multiple
distributed transmitters. Finally, we also show that our system can
deliver throughput gains from joint beamforming with off-the-shelf
802.11n cards.
2. RELATED WORK
(a) Empirical systems: Recent years have seen a few systems that
tried to capture the gains promised by distributed multi-user beam-
forming [8, 31, 7, 27]. These systems, however, do not address phase
synchronization, which is a basic problem in achieving such a sys-
tem. In particular, they either require the base stations to be tightly
synchronized with a Global Positioning System (GPS) clock1, or as-
sume that all the transmit antennas are driven by a single oscilla-
tor [7], or even assume that the receivers can jointly decode the data
by exchanging all the received signals [27]. The closest to our work
is [17], which addresses phase synchronization, but does not per-
form distributed joint transmission and achieves large errors (around
20 degrees) that cannot support distributed MIMO. In contrast, JMB
provides the ﬁrst system that achieves phase synchronization using
independent oscillators at the devices in the network. As a result,
JMB can enable devices to operate independently without having to
share a common clock or use external clocks such as GPS. Finally,
since JMB does not require any modiﬁcations to existing hardware,
it can work with off-the-shelf 802.11n cards.
JMB is related to work on enabling concurrent transmissions
across different nodes in the network like MU-MIMO in LTE and
WiMAX [24, 21], SAM [37], IAC [10], multi-user beamforming [3]
, and n+ [19]. However, these systems do not scale with the number
of devices in the network. In particular, the throughput of these sys-
tems is limited either by the number of antennas on a single AP [24,
21, 37, 3], or the maximum number of antennas on any device in
the network [19], or twice the number of antennas on any device in
the network [10]. In contrast, JMB is the ﬁrst system that enables
the number of concurrent transmissions to scale with the number of
APs, independent of the number of antennas on a single device. This
allows JMB to support multiple independent APs communicating si-
multaneously with multiple independent clients.
JMB is also related to work on harnessing channel diversity gains
such as distributed antenna systems [22, 5], and SourceSync [30],
as well as work on phased arrays [11], which provide directional
gain by sending the same signal on different antennas with differ-
ent, carefully calibrated delays. However, these systems can not pro-
vide multiplexing beneﬁts and hence, unlike JMB, cannot scale net-
work throughput with the number of APs. Finally, recent work has
shown how to synchronize concurrent transmissions in time and fre-
quency [36, 30]. JMB builds on these results to deliver a distributed

such a GPS-based system hard to use in practice.

MIMO system. However, time and frequency synchronization alone
are not sufﬁcient, since joint multi-user beamforming intrinsically
depends on the ability of the distributed APs to achieve phase syn-
chronization, without which it is impossible to allow independent
clients to decode simultaneously.
(b) Theoretical results: There is some theoretical work [38, 4] that
addresses distributed phase synchronization, but assumes frequency
synchronous oscillators and only provides one-time phase offset cal-
ibration. Further, the promise of distributed MIMO to improve the
scalability of wireless networks has been explored in the theoreti-
cal community [2, 35, 41]. Work by Ozgur et al. [28] theoretically
proved that such a setup can scale wireless capacity with the number
of nodes. While JMB builds on this foundational work, JMB is the
ﬁrst empirical system that shows that linear scaling of throughput
with the number of transmitters is possible in practical systems with
unsynchronized oscillators and resulting time-varying phase differ-
ences.
3. JMB OVERVIEW
JMB is designed for the wireless downlink channel. It is appli-
cable to wireless LANs, especially in dense deployments like en-
terprises, hotels, and conference rooms. JMB APs can operate with
off-the-shelf WiFi client hardware. The techniques in JMB are also
applicable to cellular networks, but the potential of integrating them
with off-the-shelf cellular clients and evaluating them in the cellular
context are beyond the scope of this paper.
JMB APs are connected by a high throughput backend, say, Gi-
gabit Ethernet, like they are today. Packets intended for receivers
are distributed to all APs through the shared backend. JMB enables
these APs to transmit concurrently to multiple clients, as if they were
one large MIMO node, potentially delivering as many streams (i.e.,
packets) as the total number of antennas on all APs.
In the next few sections, we describe how JMB works. We start
with the basic idea that enables distributed phase synchronization.
We then describe our protocol implementing this basic idea for em-
ulating a large MIMO node. We then extend our system to integrate
our design with off-the-shelf WiFi cards.
4. DISTRIBUTED PHASE SYNCHRONIZA-
TION
The chief goal of distributed phase synchronization is to enable
different transmitters powered by different oscillators to emulate a
single multi-antenna transmitter where all antennas are driven by the
same oscillator. Intuitively our solution is simple: We declare one
transmitter the lead, and make all other transmitters synchronize to
the oscillator of the lead transmitter, i.e., each transmitter measures
the offset between its oscillator and the lead oscillator and compen-
sates for the offset by appropriately correcting the phase of its trans-
mitted signal. This behavior makes all transmitters act as if they were
antennas on the same chip controlled by the same oscillator.
We now demonstrate how this intuitive design can deliver the
proper MIMO behavior and hence enable each receiver to correctly
decode its intended signal without interference. For simplicity, we
consider a scenario of 2 single-antenna APs transmitting to 2 single-
antenna clients, as shown in Fig. 2. Let hij, where, i, j ∈ {1, 2} be
the channel to client i from AP j, xj(t) the symbol that needs to be
delivered to client j at time t, and yj(t) the symbol that is received
by client j at time t. Correspondingly, let H = [hij], i, j ∈ {1, 2} be
the 2x2 channel matrix, (cid:126)x(t) = [x1(t) x2(t)]T be the desired symbol
vector, and (cid:126)y(t) = [y1(t) y2(t)]T be the received symbol vector.
