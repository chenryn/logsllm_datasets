### Data Collection and Privacy Disparities Between Apps and Websites

The observed disparities in data collection between apps and websites can be attributed to the different mechanisms for data collection, distinct analytics companies, and separate development teams. Despite providing the same functionality, these services often fail to implement uniform data collection policies across platforms. This discrepancy offers users the opportunity to make informed privacy decisions when choosing between installing an app or using a website, independent of the underlying reasons for these differences.

### Recipients of PII Leaks

To understand the extent of user PII exposure to third parties, we analyzed our dataset based on which third-party entities are contacted (via web or app) and identified whether app- or web-based trackers collect more or less of a specific type of PII. We focused on the top-20 A&A domains receiving PII, sorted by the total number of leaks. Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown, including the domain (excluding the top-level domain), the number of services that contact it, the average number of leaks per service, and the number of leaked identifiers. Our analysis revealed significant overlap between the apps and websites that contact each A&A domain, indicating that services tend to use the same trackers and ad networks across platforms.

Notably, the A&A domain with the highest number of leaks (Amobee) is used by the fewest services (1). Additionally, Amobee receives a similar set of PII over both apps and websites (intersection set size is two). Facebook emerged as the most frequently contacted domain across our tested apps. Interestingly, with a few exceptions, top A&A domains collect at least one type of PII from apps that are not collected via websites. This suggests that third parties are leveraging different platforms to expand their data collection. For example, YieldMo only collects PII from apps in our set of services.

### PII Leakage Across Platforms

Table 3 provides a detailed breakdown of how each type of PII is leaked across websites and apps, again sorted by the total number of leaks. The most commonly leaked types of PII include locations, names, and unique tracking IDs, with device-specific IDs being leaked only over apps. The first column group shows that the overlap in the apps and websites leaking specific pieces of PII is relatively low (except for location), reinforcing our finding that services may have very different privacy profiles across platforms. The third column group indicates that each type of PII is leaked to a significant number of domains by both apps and websites, though the common domains between the two represent only a fraction of the total.

### Summary

In summary, there is no clear winner in terms of privacy footprint between apps and their web counterparts. Both platforms leak significant information, but typically not the same information. This finding underscores the importance of user awareness and the need for custom recommendations to manage privacy effectively.

### Concluding Discussion

This paper addresses the question: "Are apps or websites better for privacy?" The answer is not straightforward. While more domains are contacted from websites and more device identifiers are leaked from apps, we found a pervasive tracking ecosystem that exposes users' PII across both platforms and different services. The answer ultimately depends on user preferences and priorities for controlling access to their PII. Our analysis provides the necessary data to inform custom recommendations for privacy, available at [https://recon.meddle.mobi/appvsweb/](https://recon.meddle.mobi/appvsweb/).

### Future Research

Future research could explore cross-service PII leaks and provide users with actionable information about how leaked PII can be used to build profiles. Another interesting area is the effectiveness of existing browser privacy protection tools in light of our findings and how ReCon can be augmented to provide improved protection in the mobile environment.
