believe this occurs due to the fact that apps and Web sites
often have diﬀerent mechanisms for data collection, diﬀer-
ent analytics companies, and diﬀerent development teams.
Interestingly, the services we tested provide the same func-
tionality over app and Web, and should in theory be able
to provide (at a high level) uniform data collection policies
across platforms. The fact that they do not provides an
opportunity for users to make informed privacy decisions
when choosing whether to install an app or use a Web site
(independent of the reasons behind these diﬀerences).
Recipients of PII Leaks.
To understand how per-
vasively user PII is exposed to other parties, we analyze
our dataset according to which third party is contacted (via
Web or app), and identify whether app- or Web-based track-
ers collect more or less of a certain type of PII. We focus
on the top-20 A&A domains receiving PII (sorted by total
leaks in our dataset). Table 2 shows each domain (absent
its top-level domain), the number of services that contact
it, the average number of leaks per service, and the number
of leaked identiﬁers. We observe signiﬁcant overlap between
the apps and Web sites that contact each A&A domain, re-
vealing that services tend to utilize the same trackers and
ad networks across platforms.
Notably, the A&A domain receiving the most leaks
(Amobee) is used by the fewest services (1). Further, the
third column group shows that Amobee receives a similar
set of PII over app and Web (intersection set size is two).
In addition, we ﬁnd that Facebook is the most pervasively
contacted domain across our tested apps.
Interestingly, with few exceptions, top A&A domains col-
lect at least one type of PII from apps that are not collected
via Web sites. Thus, third-parties are leveraging diﬀerent
platforms to expand the set of data that they collect about
users. We also see a small number of cases of platform-
speciﬁc data collection, e.g., YieldMo only collects PII from
apps in our set of services.
Table 2: Top-20 A&A domains, sorted by total leaks.
Last, we focus on how each type of PII is leaked across
Web sites and apps in Table 3 (again, sorted by total leaks).
We see that locations, names, and unique tracking IDs are
most commonly leaked, with device-speciﬁc IDs being leaked
only over apps. The ﬁrst column group shows that the apps
and Web sites leaking speciﬁc pieces of PII have relatively
low overlap (except for location), reinforcing our ﬁnding that
services may have very diﬀerent privacy proﬁles across plat-
forms. Similarly, the third column group shows that each
type of PII is leaked to a signiﬁcant number of domains by
both apps and Web sites, though the domains in common
between the two is a fraction of the total.
In summary, we ﬁnd that there is no clear winner in terms
of privacy-footprint between apps and their Web counter-
parts. Services leak signiﬁcant information on both plat-
forms, but typically not the same information.

5. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
This paper asks a simple question—are apps or Web sites
better for privacy?—and ﬁnds the answer not at all straight-
forward. Several clear trends emerged: more domains are
contacted from Web sites, and more device identiﬁers were
leaked from apps. However, we also found a pervasive track-
ing ecosystem that exposes users’ PII across both Web and
app versions of the same service, and across diﬀerent ser-
vices.
In short, there is no single answer to the seminal
question in this work; rather, the answer depends on user
preferences and priorities for controlling access to their PII.
Our analysis provides the necessary data to inform custom
recommendations for privacy via:
https://recon.meddle.mobi/appvsweb/
There are a number of interesting topics for future re-
search. For example, we would like to understand cross-
service PII leaks, as well as provide users with actionable
information about how leaked PII can be used by other par-
ties to build proﬁles about them. An interesting question is
how eﬀective are existing browser privacy protection tools
in light of our ﬁndings, and how we might augment ReCon
to provide improved protection in the mobile environment.
