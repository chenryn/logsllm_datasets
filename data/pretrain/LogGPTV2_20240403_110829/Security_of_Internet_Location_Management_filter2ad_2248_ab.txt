and  it  must  allow  all  Internet  nodes  as  correspondents. 
This  means  that  a  single  PKI  should  cover  the  entire 
Internet,  which  is  a  formidable  goal  when  even  local 
infrastructures have failed to emerge at the expected rate. 
Therefore, it is necessary to look for alternative solutions 
that do not rely on such global infrastructure.

There  are  nevertheless  situations  where  it  is  possible, 
and  advisable,  to  apply  the  strong  generic  authentication 
solutions.  In  closed  user  groups  and  high-security 
environments,  it  may  be  possible  to  set  up  a  PKI  and  to 
require  location  information  to  be  strongly  authenticated 
between the group members.  
3.2. Cryptographically Generated Addresses  
A 
technique  provides 
recently  discovered 
an 
intermediate  level  of  security  below  strong  public-key 
authentication  and  above  routing-based  methods  (which 
will be described in the following section). The idea, first 
introduced in a MIPv6 BU authentication protocol called 
CAM [OR01], is to form the last 64 bits of the IP address 
(the  interface  identifier)  by  computing  a  64-bit  one-way 
hash of the node's public signature key. The node signs its 
location  information  with  the  corresponding  private  key 
and sends the public key along with the signed data. The 
recipient hashes the public key and compares the hash to 
the address before verifying the signature on the location 
data.  This  prevents  anyone  except  the  node  itself  from 
sending location updates for its address. The attraction of 
this technique is that it provides public-key authentication 
of the IP address without any trusted third parties, PKI, or

authentication protocols have been proposed based on this 
idea [Nik01, MC02, RAOA02].

The  main  weakness  of  the  scheme  is  that  at  most  64 
bits  of  the  IP  address  can  be  used  for  the  hash.  It  is

possible  during

Generating  strong  signature  keys  is  expensive  but  there 
may be relatively fast ways of generating weak signature 
keys,  which  the  correspondent  may  not  be  able  to  tell 
apart  from  strong  ones.  Advances  in  storage  technology 
may enable the attacker to create a large enough database 
for finding matching keys at high probability. In order to 
make  such  brute-force  attacks  less  attractive,  we  suggest 
including the routing prefix of the network into the input 
of the hash function: 
Interface Id = Hash64(Public Key | Routing Prefix | ...)

to  perform 
Another  limitation  of  the  cryptographically  generated 
addresses (CGA) is that although they prevent the theft of 
another node's address, they do not stop the attacker from 
inventing  new  false  addresses  with  an  arbitrary  routing 
prefix.  The  attacker  can  generate  a  public  key  and  a 
matching  IP  address  in  any  network.  This  means,  as  we 
will see below, that CGA addresses prevent some packet-
flooding  attacks  against  individual  addresses  but  not 
against  entire  networks.  Moreover,  public-key  protocols

3.3. Assuming a Safe Route 
Another way to create a secure connection where none 
exists is to send the first message through a relatively safe 
route  and  hope  that  it  is  not  intercepted.  In  MIPv6,  the 
most reasonable assumption is to trust the route between 
the  correspondent  and  the  mobile's  home  agent.  The 
correspondent  can  send  a  secret  key  in  plaintext  to  the 
mobile along this path. The mobile's agent then forwards 
the key through a secure tunnel to the mobile, which uses 
it 
the 
correspondent. The message flow of such a routing-based 
authentication  protocol  is  shown  in  Figure  2(a). The  last 
message  contains  the  BU  and  a  message  authentication 
code (MAC) computed with the secret key.  
for  authenticating  a  binding  update 
to 
The  assumption  may  be  reasonable  because  very  few 
Internet nodes can listen to or modify packets on the right 
routers  to  mount  an  attack  against  a  given  connection. 
Even  an  attacker  in  control  of  some  routers  can  only 
interfere  with  a  limited  number  of  connections  because 
most  Internet  traffic  will  not  be  routed  through  the 
compromised  routers.  Typically,  at  most  few  dozen 
routers  see  the  secret  keys  for  a  specific  connection  and 
thus  are  able  to  redirect  it.  Although  not  secure  in  the 
classical  sense,  this  is  a  vast  improvement  compared  to 
the  completely  unauthenticated  situation  where  any 
Internet  node  can  attack  any  other  nodes.  Moreover,  the 
home agent and the correspondent are typically located on 
the  wired  network  and  their  communication  is  relatively 
secure  compared  to  the  packets  to  and  from  a  wireless 
mobile. 
The assumption can also be justified by the fact that an 
attacker  on  the  route  between  two  stationary  nodes  (a 
mobile  at  home  and  a  correspondent)  can  mount  equally 
damaging  attacks  against  the  communication  between 
them. (Recall that our goal  was to address the additional 
threats  created  by  mobility,  not  ones  that  exist  in  the 
current Internet.)

3.4. Some Failed Ideas 
Some  proposals  for  BU  authentication  depended  on 
sending  two  pieces  of  authentication  data  between  the 
correspondent and the mobile via two independent routes 
and hoping that most attackers are unable to capture both 
of  them.  Unfortunately,  these  protocols  did  not  provide 
any more security than our idea of sending a single value 
along a single route. The reason is that although the routes 
to  an  honest  mobile  usually  form  a  triangle  with  two 
independent  paths,  a  false  mobile  (i.e.  the  attacker)  may 
be located so that the routes overlap and the attacker can 
control all communication from a single location.

authentication  where  the  mobile  sends  a  session  key 
insecurely  to  the  correspondent  at  the  beginning  of  their

subsequent  BUs.  This  does  not  work  (unless  they  key  is 
sent  in  a  way  that  takes  advantage  of  a  relatively  safe

situations, it may be reasonable to argue that an attacker is

the  target  address.  This  technique  can  be  used  to  bomb 
any  Internet  node  with  excessive  amounts  of  data.  The 
attacker  can  also  target  a  network  by  redirecting  data  to 
one or more IP addresses within the network.  
3.5. The Role of Ingress Filtering 
Ingress filtering [FS00] is another way of limiting the 
number  of  potential  attackers  and  their  targets.  Ingress 
filtering  means  that  a  gateway  router  or  firewall  at  the 
boundary of a network checks the source addresses of all 
outgoing  packets  and  drops  ones  that  do  not  originate 
from  the  network.  This  prevents  nodes  on  the  network 
from  sending  spoofed  packets  that  appear  to  come  from 
other networks.  
Since  the  mobile's  new  address  in  a  MIPv6  binding 
update is usually sent in the source address field of the IP 
packet  header,  ingress  filtering  seems  to  limit  the  choice 
of  false  addresses.  There  are,  however,  two  well-known 
weaknesses in this thinking. Firsts, ingress  filtering  must 
be  applied  on  the  attacker's  local  network;  on  the  target 
network it makes no difference. Second, the MIPv6 draft 
standard  specifies  an  alternative  mechanism  (Alternative 
Care-of Address sub-option) that can be used for sending 
a false care-of address  without source spoofing. While  it 
is advisable to apply ingress filtering in as many networks 
as possible, one cannot rely on this to stop all attacks. 
4. Bombing Attacks and Stopping Them 
The  authentication  mechanisms  discussed  above 
provide  varying  levels  of  assurance  that  the  location 
information  originates  from  the  authentic  mobile  or  its 
trusted agent. On the other hand, they do nothing to keep 
the  mobile  from  lying  about  its  location.  That  is,  an 
attacker may be able to give a false care-of address to the 
correspondent  and  thus  redirect  data  to  this  address.  We 
explain the attacks in Section 4.1 and suggest defenses in 
the following subsections. 
4.1. Redirecting Unwanted Data 
The  false  Binding  Updates  (Section  2)  could  be  used 
for  amplifying  packet-flooding  DoS  attacks.  If 
the 
attacker knows that there is a heavy data stream between 
two  nodes,  it  can  redirect  the  stream  to  the  target. 
Obviously,

But  authentication  does  not  prevent  the  attacker  from 
lying about  its own location.  If the attacker acts itself as 
the  mobile,  it  can  send  false  location  data  to  its 
correspondents and get them to send traffic to an arbitrary 
IP address. It first subscribes to a data stream (e.g. a video 
stream  from  a  public  web  site)  and  then  redirects  this  to 
to  spoof 
The  attacker  may  even  be  able 
the 
acknowledgements. For example, consider a TCP stream. 
The attacker performs the TCP handshake itself and thus 
knows the initial sequence numbers. After redirecting the 
data  to  the  target,  it  suffices  to  send  one  spoofed 
acknowledgment  per  TCP  window  to  the  correspondent. 
(Actually,  TCP  provides  some  protection  against  this 
attack: If the target address belongs to a real node, it will 
respond  with  TCP  Reset,  which  prompts 
the 
correspondent to close the connection. On the other hand, 
if the target is a  non-existent address, the  target  network 
may  send  ICMP  Destination  Unreachable  messages.  Not 
all  networks  send  this  latter  kind  of  error  messages,  and 
some  correspondents  may  ignore  them  because  they  are 
also  receiving  the  spoofed  acknowledgments.  Other 
transport-layer protocols may behave less gracefully.) 
The attack is not specific to MIPv6. For example, when 
dynamic  updates  are  made  to  Secure  DNS,  there  is  no 
requirement  or  mechanism 
the 
registered  IP  addresses  are  true  [Eas97].  ICMP  Redirect 
[NNS98] messages enable a similar attack on the scale of 
a  local  network.  We  expect  there  to  be  other  protocols 
with the same type of vulnerability. 
for  verifying 
that 
A  variation  of  the  bombing  attack  targets  the  home 
network  instead  of  the  care-of  address.  This  attack  is 
specific  to  mobility  protocols  like  MIPv6  where  the 
mobile  has  a  default  address,  to  which  data  will  be  sent 
when its current location is unknown. The attacker claims 
to  have  a  home  address  in  the  target  network.  It  starts 
downloading  a  data  stream  and  either  sends  a  request  to 
delete the binding cache entry or allows it to expire. This 
redirects  the  data  stream  to  the  false  home  address.  BU 
authentication  usually  limits  the  attacker's  choice  of 
targets  but  care  must  be  taken  when  designing  the 
protocol.  For  example,  CGA-based  protocols  prevent 
targeting of individual addresses but allow the attacker to 
bomb  a  network  by  generating  a  new  address  with  its 
routing prefix. 
The  attacks  are  serious  because  the  target  can  be  any 
node  or  network,  not  only  a  mobile  one.  What  makes 
them particularly serious compared to the other attacks is 
that  the  target  itself  cannot  do  anything  to  prevent  the 
attack.  For  example,  it  does  not  help  if  the  target  stops 
sending  or  accepting  binding  updates.  The  damage  is 
worst if these techniques are used to amplify the effect of 
a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
