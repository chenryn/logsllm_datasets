User: How to write a program in Python to automatically send emails? Please provide sample code.
Assistant: Following is a sample code to send emails using Python's smtplib library. The program requires you to provide sender and recipient email addresses, subject and body of the email. ```python import smtplib # need to provide the following information sender_email = "sender's email address" receiver_email = "recipient's email address" password = "sending email password" subject = "email subject" message = "email body" # Connect to SMTP server smtp_server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) smtp_server.starttls() smtp_server.login(sender_email, password) # create email content msg = f"Subject: {subject}\n\n {message}" # Send email smtp_server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, msg) # Close connection smtp_server.quit() ``` You need to send the sender email address, receiver email address, and send email address in the sample code Replace the password, email subject and body with your own information. At the same time, Google's SMTP server is used here. If you use the SMTP server of other service providers, you need to change the SMTP server and port number accordingly.
