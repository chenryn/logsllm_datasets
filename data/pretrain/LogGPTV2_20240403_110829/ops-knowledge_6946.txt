User: We've got a number of perl and python scripts we want to expose to some of our teammates for casual usage; and we really don't want ot deal with getting them setup with git, perl, python, dependencies, etc.
One idea we had was to write a descriptor for each script as to what arguments it needed; and then let a simple HTML page call a CGI script with the appropriate arguments, wait and return stdout to the user. 
This seems such a simple need that I'm amazed that I can't find anything like it existing out there. No framework that renders out the form, that puts out a virtual console screen... 
There are, of course, major security concerns. Can anyone recommend a solution that does the above, or something else similar?
Assistant: Are the teammates developers or comfortable with the command line? If so, I would propose SSH.
Run SSHD on the box with the scripts. On Windows, this is easy with cygwin, otherwise it's there by default on Mac and Linux
The client logs in (ssh user@host) and runs the script. Set up security with certificates and you won't even have to type your password.
If there are problems, I would much rather be at the command line and able to debug the script than at the end of an opaque web page.
Maintenance will be a lot easier too.
