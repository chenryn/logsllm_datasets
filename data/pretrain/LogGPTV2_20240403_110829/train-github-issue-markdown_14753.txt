## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Every loader that uses `[hash]` needs to use `[hash:10]` to be consistent if
webpack's options were set as `output: { hashDigestLength: 10 } }`. It would
be better if loaders were able to use the same value by default if they choose
to.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
`hashDigestLength` should be able to be used by `[hash]` in file-loader and
other loaders if they choose to, so that `[hash]` would by default have a
length of `10`.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
In webpack/loader-utils#121 (comment) it says that the issue should be solved
on the webpack side. There was also an issue in `file-loader` project which
said it can't be solved there.
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**
