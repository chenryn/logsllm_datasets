I am currently following the steps outlined in the SciPy contributor guide to obtain a development version of SciPy. When I run the command `python3 runtests.py -v` in the terminal, the tests proceed successfully up to 22%, at which point an error occurs:

```
scipy/linalg/tests/test_decomp.py::TestEigh::test_eigh_integer realloc(): invalid next size
Fatal Python error: Aborted
```

Unfortunately, I am unable to reproduce the error consistently.

**System Specifications:**
- Ubuntu: 16.04

If you have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue or need more information, please let me know.
