I am in the process of following the exact steps as mentioned in the scipy
contributer guide in order to obtain a development version of scipy . When I
run the code ' python3 runtests.py -v ' on terminal , on after passing 22% of
the test , it gives an error :
scipy/linalg/tests/test_decomp.py::TestEigh::test_eigh_integer realloc():
invalid next size  
Fatal Python error: Aborted
Sorry its not really possible to reproduce the error.
