### Environment
- **Dubbo Version:** 2.5.2 (test), but there are multiple versions in use within the company.
  - `com.alibaba:dubbo:2.5.2`
  - `org.javassist:javassist`

- **Operating System Version:**
  ```sh
  Darwin tes.local 17.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.7.0: Thu Jun 21 22:53:14 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4570.71.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
  ```

- **Java Version:**
  Multiple versions are in use within the company (e.g., 1.6, 1.7).
  ```sh
  java version "1.8.0_161"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode)
  ```

### Reason
The lower version of Dubbo does not provide an elegant way to close the Dubbo service network. As a result, we are using reflection for compatibility, but we are unable to determine the number of consumers. 

I can obtain the provider information using reflection, but I am unable to get the consumer information. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and help. Please forgive any errors in my English.
