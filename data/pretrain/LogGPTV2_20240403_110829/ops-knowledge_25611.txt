User: I'm running GDB with a bash(.sh) script that does need sudo/super user access and it works good, but there is a problem, every time i runs gdb with that script, before gdb load the executable it will ask about running python with superuser. I want to remove this requirement/question.
I want to remove this:

WARNING: Phyton has been executed as super user! It is recommended to
  run as a normal user. Continue? (y/N)

I'm using gdb 7.9 on ubuntu server 12.x which i compiled by my own.
Ps: In another ubuntu server(version 15) the gdb(version 7.9) will not ask this question using the same script and access.
Assistant: Run gdb with the --batch command line option. This will disable all confirmation requests. You can also run the command "set confirm off"
