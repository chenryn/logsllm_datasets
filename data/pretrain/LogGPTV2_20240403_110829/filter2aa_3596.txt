# My Favorite Color
**Category:** Steganography  
**Points:** 50

## Description
> "My favorite color is transparent, what is yours?"  
A blank image was attached.

## Solution
Despite the image appearing to be completely blank, it contained a hidden message. By using a steganography tool such as [StegOnline](https://stegonline.georgeom.net/), we were able to extract the flag from one of the red color planes. The revealed flag is: `flag{transparent_is_the_new_black}`.
