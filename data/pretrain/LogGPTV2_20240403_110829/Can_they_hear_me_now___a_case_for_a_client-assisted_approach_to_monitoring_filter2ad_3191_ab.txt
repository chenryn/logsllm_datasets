composing infrequently collected measurement samples from
multiple (and potentially diverse) sources for estimating net-
work performance, as will be seen in Section 3.3. These mea-
surements were collected using client devices placed inside
personal automobiles and regularly driven over ﬁxed routes.
All of our measurements reported in this paper were col-
lected using laptops or single-board computers equipped with
diﬀerent models of cellular modems (some were USB-based
and others were PCMCIA).
Measurements collected: The Spot measurements and
Region measurements collected a speciﬁc set of performance
metric over three cellular networks, including TCP and UDP
throughput, UDP packet loss rate, application level jitter
measured in terms of Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation
(IPDV) [14], application level RTT, and ICMP-level RTT
(NetB only).
Throughput measurements were not conducted while us-
ing the WiRover system, as they would had aﬀected the net-
work performance experienced by the clients of the WiRover
system. Hence, we only collect latency measurements using
UDP pings, roughly 12 pings a minute. Details regarding
measurement settings for each dataset are summarized in
Table 2 and Table 1.
Eﬀect of vehicular mobility on measurements: In
our eﬀort to collect measurements from a vast region over
sustained durations, we were forced to utilize vehicles trav-
eling at varying speeds. To understand the eﬀects of the
vehicular speeds on our data we analyzed the distribution
of RTT latency (UDP ping test) as a function of vehicular
speed for the zones in our WiRover dataset in Figure 2(a).
As can be seen from the plot, there was very limited corre-
lation (correlation coeﬃcient mostly close to zero) between
the latency and the vehicle speed. We also plot the CDF of
the correlation coeﬃcients which were measured from each
zone in Madison and on the path from Madison to Chicago
in Figure 2(b). The plot shows that 95% of zones had little
correlation (0.16) between the speed of vehicle and latencies
observed, for typical vehicle speeds ranging from 0 km/h to
120 km/h. The absence of a correlation between the speeds
at which these measurements were collected assures us that
our datasets are representative of cellular network perfor-
mance, which are independent of (typical) vehicle speeds.
3. DESIGN OF WISCAPE FRAMEWORK
In this section we describe the design of WiScape. Fig-
ure 3 summarizes the ﬂow of this section. First, we analyze
our Wide-area datasets to characterize the performance of
cellular networks over a large spatial region to determine if
data is aggregatable in space. In Section 3.1 we use these
datasets to determine the appropriate size of zones for our
measurement framework.
In Section 3.2 we use our Spot
and Region datasets comprising of measurements collected
at ﬁner time scales to analyze the performance variations
of the three cellular networks at ﬁne-grained and coarse-
grained time scales at multiple locations. In Section 3.3.1
we determine the number of measurement samples necessary
to determine the bandwidth at a zone with certain degree of
accuracy. Then in Section 3.2 we determine the frequency
with which the measurements should be repeated. Finally,
in Section 3.3 we analyze our Region dataset to ascertain
the feasibility of carrying out client-sourced, coarse grained
performance estimation for cellular networks, involving mul-
tiple clients.
3.1 Aggregation in space (zones)
As it is not feasible to blanket monitor a entire wide-
area wireless network we must aggregate data into spatial
zones. We desire zone sizes which are small enough to ensure
similar performance at all locations inside the zone but big
enough to ensure enough measurement samples can be col-
lected for each zone to properly characterize the network’s
performance. For this purpose we analyze the variation of
TCP bandwidth measurements for NetB collected in Stan-
dalone dataset across city locations by dividing them into
circular zones of radius varying from 50 to 750 meters in
steps of 100 meters. We have not experimented with other
shapes of zones.
In Figure 4 we plot the CDF of relative standard devi-
ation (standard deviation of samples/mean of samples) for
all zones, for which we have at least 200 samples per week
over the duration of the measurement study. The left most

(b) WiRover: CDF of Correlation Coeﬃ-
cient
Figure 2: Latency is weakly correlated with typical
vehicular speeds. In Figure 2(a), the latencies are
mostly around 120 msec, with no observable trend
with increasing speeds. In Figure 2(b), the CDF of
correlation coeﬃcient between latency and vehicular
speed is less than 0.16 in 95% of zones.

sidered.
curve corresponds to zone size of 50 meters while the right
most curve corresponds to zone size of 750 meters. Further-
more, the relative standard deviation of for 80% of the zones
is around 2.5% for zones with radius of 50 meters and 7%
for zones with radius of 750 meters2. The increase can be
explained by the change in terrain conditions across bigger
zones. As can be seen from the plot, despite increasing zone
radius the relative standard deviation tends to vary only
slightly. We pick a zone radius of 250 meters as 80% of the
zones with 250 meter radius have relative standard devia-
tion less than 4% and 97% of zones have a relative standard
deviation of 8% or lower. The low relative standard devia-
tion, implies that the characteristics of locations inside the
zone are mostly similar.
2In Figure 1, some zones have a relative standard devia-
tion greater than 0.3 (mean = 1080 Kbps, dev = 350 Kbs).
These zones in Figure 1 correspond to regions with very few
samples (less than 200 hundred samples) and hence are not
considered while plotting Figure 4.
We ﬁnd that the TCP throughput does not vary signif-
icantly for the cellular network. Speciﬁcally, we note that
80% of zones have a relative standard deviation between 2%
and 8% regardless of zone size. Moreover, less than 2% of the
zones have a standard deviation of 15% or higher. Based on
the above observation we selected representative zones with
overall performance variability for NetB that was between
2% and 8% and zones with TCP throughput variability of
the other two networks that was less than 15%. These rep-
resentative zones are used for our Spot data collection, as
seen in Section 3.2.
We also examined data from WiFi-based networks as re-
ported by others (GoogleWiFi [15], RoofNet [16] and us
(MadCity Broadband [17]) in prior work on how throughput
measurements for cellular networks might compare to that
of such WiFi-based networks. Such prior work report high
and sudden variations in achievable throughputs in the WiFi
networks, often due to the use of unlicensed spectrum, ran-
dom access nature, and the characteristic of the spectrum
itself. This is contrast to the more coordinated access meth-
103ods and the licensed nature of the cellular spectrum that
provides some performance stability across epochs as de-
ﬁned above. Hence, epochs in WiFi system are likely more
diﬃcult to deﬁne than compared to these cellular systems.
The low degree of variability in cellular performance is the
motivation for exploring the feasibility of estimating cellular
data network performance using a small number of measure-
ments.
A closer look: To understand the stability of measure-
ments within individual zones, we use the Static and Prox-
imate datasets. As noted in Section 2, data for our Proxi-
mate dataset was collected by driving around in a car within
a 250 meter radius from corresponding Static dataset loca-
tions. The Proximate dataset, provides us with network
performance measurements from multiple locations in close
vicinity of the locations in Static. The measurements in
Proximate dataset are, thus, representative of the kind of
measurements we can expect to gather for a given zone from
a set of clients in a real deployment of WiScape system.
The data for Proximate dataset was collected for each zone
over a span of 5 months in Madison and 1 month in New
Brunswick. In the rest of this section, we present results for
a single zone from Madison and one in New Brunswick and
omit the results for the remaining ﬁve static locations. We
examine how the average throughput measured from Static
subset relates to the throughput measurements from the cor-
responding Proximate measurements.
We present the average and standard deviation for the
Static and corresponding Proximate measurements in Ta-
ble 3. From the table we note that the client sourced mea-
surements form a reasonable approximation of the expected
performance at a given location.
We observe that the average UDP throughput of NetB-WI
for the ground truth and the client sourced UDP traces are
876 Kbps and 855 Kbps respectively, where the percentage
of error is less than 1%. The observation holds true even in
case of representative zones from New Brunswick which has
higher degree of performance variation compared to zones
in Madison.
The jitter values reported in the Proximate dataset are
also close to 7 msec for NetA-WI which matches the corre-
sponding Static dataset jitter value shown in Table 3. Simi-
larly, the jitter for NetB-WI and NetC-WI are around 3 msec
in the Proximate dataset which again matches the Static jit-
ter value of the two networks at the location, as shown in
Table 3. We also have noted the same behavior for NetB-NJ
and NetC-NJ whose jitter values are 2.8 msec and 1.6 msec
respectively. From the above results we ﬁnd that measure-
ments collected across multiple locations within a zone are
close to each other.
Summary: We choose a radius of 250 meters for zones
as 97% of such zones in Madison have low (8%) relative
standard deviation for TCP throughput for NetB .
3.2 Aggregating in time (zone-speciﬁc epochs)
We analyze data from Spot dataset to understand the per-
formance of the three cellular networks over diﬀerent gran-
ularities of time. As noted in Table 2, the Spot data was
collected at ﬁve distinct locations in Madison and two loca-
tions in New Jersey, for all three networks, to characterize
the performance of the cellular networks at a ﬁne granularity.
In particular we study coarse (30 minutes) and ﬁne (10 sec-
onds) time scale variations of diﬀerent performance param-
eters such as throughput, loss rate etc. and in Section 3.2.2
we explain the mechanism for calculating the epoch duration
for the monitored zones.
3.2.1 Performance at different time granularities
We look at Spot data measurements to characterize the
performance variability of cellular networks. We present
data from two representative locations, one in Madison and
another in New Brunswick where the relative standard devi-
ation (standard deviation/average) of any of the parameters
(TCP and UDP throughput, Jitter, Loss rate) was less than
0.15, for the entire monitored duration. The highest relative
standard deviation of 0.15 was observed for TCP through-
put at both locations. We observed similar properties for the
other four measured locations in Wisconsin and one other lo-
cation in New Jersey, but do not present them in this paper
for the sake of brevity.
Coarse time scale: We present the average throughput,
jitter, and error rates, averaged in 30 minute bins collected
in Madison and New Brunswick in Figure 5(a,b,c,d) and
5(e,f,g,h) respectively. As can be seen from Figure 5, for the
selected location in Madison, the NetA network on an aver-
age oﬀers throughput beneﬁt greater than 50% for both TCP
and UDP over the worst performing network. We also ﬁnd
that the variance in throughput across all three networks
over the entire duration is less than 0.15 of their long term
average. Moreover, all three networks have a packet loss
rate less than 1% with a very low variation (Figure 5(d)).
We ﬁnd from Figure 5(c) that the jitter is around 3 msec for
