# What / Why
Executing `npm ci` ignores the `os` field in package.json. This causes
platform specific packages like `fsevents` (macOS-only) to be installed on
other platforms (Windows in this case).
## When
  * Every install through `npm ci`
## Where
  * Packages with the `os` field specified in package.json
## How
### Current Behavior
  * See description
### Steps to Reproduce
  1. Run npm init in a new directory on a windows machine
  2. Install a package with a deeply nested optional dependency on fsevents, like webpack: `npm i webpack`
  3. Notice a package-lock.json is created with an optional dependency on `PI:EMAIL`
  4. Remove `node_modules` te create a clean CI clone state
  5. Run `npm ci`
  6. See the installation fail because `fsevents` is downloaded, installed, and node-gyp is executed as a result.
### Expected Behavior
  * `fsevents` is skipped as the package is unsupported on Windows.
