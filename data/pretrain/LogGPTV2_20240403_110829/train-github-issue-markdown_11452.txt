Elasticsearch generates an InvalidShapeException from polygons generated by
PostGIS:
    MapperParsingException[failed to parse [catchment_mpoly]]; nested: InvalidShapeException[Provided shape has duplicate consecutive coordinates at: (145.105506775, -37.791859504, NaN)]
This particular check seems overzealous.
It's also surprising, given that the polygons are being fed through
`ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology`. It is generating errors after its own precision
is applied?
