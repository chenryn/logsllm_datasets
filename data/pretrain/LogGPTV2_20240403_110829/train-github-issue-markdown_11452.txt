Elasticsearch is generating an `InvalidShapeException` for polygons that are created by PostGIS. The specific error message is as follows:

```
MapperParsingException[failed to parse [catchment_mpoly]]; nested: InvalidShapeException[Provided shape has duplicate consecutive coordinates at: (145.105506775, -37.791859504, NaN)]
```

This error occurs due to the presence of duplicate consecutive coordinates in the polygon. The check that triggers this exception appears to be overly strict.

What is particularly surprising is that these polygons have already been processed using the `ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology` function, which should simplify the geometry while preserving its topological structure. It seems unusual that the simplified polygons would still contain duplicate consecutive coordinates and thus generate errors after the precision adjustments have been applied.
