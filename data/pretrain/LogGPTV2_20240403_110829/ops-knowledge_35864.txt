Question: Why is it not sufficient to rely solely on client-side JavaScript frameworks that automatically escape output to prevent stored XSS attacks like the one described involving malicious script storage on a web server?
"A": "Client-side frameworks cannot prevent malicious data that has already been stored on the server from being sent to the client's browser in the first place.",
"B": "All client-side JavaScript frameworks have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by stored XSS attacks without exception.",
"C": "Client-side frameworks may increase page load times, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct XSS attacks.",
"D": "Server-side technologies are inherently more secure than client-side technologies and should be used exclusively."
Answer: A
