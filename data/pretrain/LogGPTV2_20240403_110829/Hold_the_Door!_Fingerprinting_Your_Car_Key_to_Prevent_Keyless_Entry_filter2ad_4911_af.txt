setup in Section V-C. Advanced
adversaries are equipped with analog ﬁlters or an SDR device
with a high sample rate.
1) Ampliﬁcation attacks using analog ﬁlters: Advanced
dual-band relay adversaries can attempt to make a low value
for kurtosis by using an ampliﬁer with a pre- and post-analog
bandpass ﬁlter (BPF). In this attack scenario, adversaries use
pre- and post- analog ﬁlters to reduce unwanted noise. An
analog ﬁlter is a circuit made of analog components such as
resistors, capacitors, inductors, and op amps. Digital ﬁlters are
often embedded in a chip that operates on digital signals,
such as an MCU or DSP. Analog ﬁlters are fairly simple
but increase in complexity for narrow bandwidth and precise
roll-off. In contrast, digital ﬁlters, which are employed in
HODOR can be more precise in ﬁltering, but the signal must be
digitally sampled. Among the bandpass ﬁlters of MiniCircuits,
we used the one with the bandwidth most relevant to the
UHF band [9]. The low and high cut-off frequencies of the
bandpass ﬁlter are 400MHz and 510MHz, respectively. Fig. 18
shows the ampliﬁer used with the BPF in our evaluation. The
pre-/post-bandpass ﬁlters were connected to the input/output
port of each ampliﬁer. We conducted the same experiment as
the one used in the ampliﬁcation attack. Fig. 19 shows the
output distributions of the k-NN and SVM algorithms as a
function of the ampliﬁers. As seen in the ﬁgure, compared
to the ampliﬁcation attack without analog ﬁlters (Fig. 10),
the normalized output distance/score is slightly closer to the
legitimate case. Nevertheless, the k-NN and SVM algorithms

attack scenario
both output an FPR of 0% and FNR of 0% at thresholds
(ΓP KES) of 4 and 5, respectively. Since the bandpass ﬁlter
has a larger bandwidth (110MHz) than HODOR (30kHz),
ﬁltered noise has a negligible effect on the performance of
HODOR. This is because the analog bandpass ﬁlter has a larger
bandwidth than the digital bandpass ﬁlter of HODOR, which
still ampliﬁes the noise signals within the bandwidth of the
digital bandpass ﬁlter and corrupts the value of kurtosis. In
addition, if adversaries use the digital bandpass ﬁlter with a
narrower bandwidth than that of HODOR, it accompanies both
the ADC and DAC processes which corrupt the kurtosis and
spectral brightness. This corruption can be observed in the
evaluation results of the playback attack detection. As a result,
we concluded that HODOR is able to detect an ampliﬁcation
attack even with pre-/post-analog ﬁlters.
2) Playback attack with high sample rate: We also assumed
the presence of an adversary with strong PHY-layer sampling
capabilities in addition to the ampliﬁcation adversaries using
the analog ﬁlter. To evaluate HODOR with a high sample
capability, we used the maximum sampling rate of the USRP
X310 used in our evaluation. Because the Ethernet interface
did not support the maximum sample rate, we employed a
new PCIe x4 interface that can tolerate 200M samples/s on
baseband signals [6]. Through the PCIe X4 interface,
the
USRP X310 was connected with a desktop where an Intel
i7-7700 3.6GHz processor CPU with 16G RAM and a 512GB
SSD were installed.
We generated UHF-band signals with high samples by
using the USRP X310. HODOR captured the generated signals
with a sample rate of 5MS/s by using HackRF One. After
14

a function of sample rate
that, HODOR analyzed the features of the captured signals
to compare the differences with those from a legitimate key
fob. Considering the 200MHz of master clock rates (MCR)
supported on the USRP X310, its sample rates must be an
integer decimation rate of the MCR [8]. Accordingly, we
performed experiments with sample rates of 10MS/s, 25MS/s,
50MS/s, and 100MS/s. Theoretically, 200MS/s is also possible
on the USRP X310, but the signals with a sample rate of
200MS/s cannot be properly generated by our experimental
setup. It seems that higher performing hardware is required.
Fig. 20 shows the output distribution of the attack with a high
sample rate. As shown in the Fig. 20, the attacks with a higher
sample rate up to 25MS/s have a much closer output distance
to those with legitimate signals. Rather, the output distance
increases as the sample rate exceeds 50MS/s. We conclude that
a higher sample rate is not helpful to impersonate a legitimate
signal. However, it should be noted that this result is from an
experiment done with a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) device.
For further research on high sample rate attacks, more state-
of-the-art equipment is required, such as a pair of arbitrary
function generators and a tunable mixer.
L. Dynamic Channel Conditions
it
A dynamic condition may decrease the performance of
HODOR in identifying a legitimate key fob. We further eval-
uated HODOR under additional conditions, such as an under-
ground parking lot and a roadside parking space as shown
in Fig. 21. The underground parking lot had enough spaces
for approximately 700 cars, and many cars were frequently
entering and leaving the facility. Compared with an outdoor
parking lot,
is expected that a greater number of mul-
tipath components are present because of the ceiling and
thick concrete pillars, which can affect the performance of
HODOR. In addition, we evaluated HODOR when the vehicle
was parked on the road. This place was very crowded with
pedestrians and moving vehicles. Furthermore, our evaluation
was conducted during the most crowded hours of the day.
For both environments, we placed the key fob in a backpack.
Fig. 22 shows the output distribution of the k-NN and SVM
algorithms as a function of place where the vehicle was parked.
When the vehicle is parked in the underground parking lot,
the k-NN and SVM algorithms output an FPR of 5% and
4% with an FNR of 0%. When the vehicle is parked in a
roadside parking space, the k-NN and SVM algorithms output
an FPR of 2% and 3% with an FNR of 0%. We should note
[40] performed a comprehensive survey and security analysis
of the RKE system implemented in vehicles manufactured
by Volkswagen. The authors describe various types of RKE
systems used in Volkswagen vehicles, and revealed that they
were using a single worldwide secret key. Moreover, Benadjila
et al. [22] demonstrate attacks on RKE systems using the
Hitag-2 cryptographic algorithm. The authors demonstrate that
it is possible to extract the rogue key (a.k.a. not the true secret
key), while, in turn, exploiting a weakness of the Hitag-2
cryptographic algorithm. More recent studies further reveal a
weakness of the AUT64 automotive cryptographic algorithm.
In [45], the authors demonstrate the full details of AUT64
including a complete speciﬁcation and analysis of a block
cipher. The authors propose two key-recovery attacks based
on cryptographic weakness. In addition to studies based on
the weaknesses of cryptographic algorithms, roll jam attacks
on RKE systems have also been studied [67]. In this type of
attack, an adversary avoids being discovered by the victim
while jamming and eavesdropping, and at
the same time,
obtains a valid rolling code. In this scenario, the car owner
would not suspect an attack despite having pressed the button
on their key fob twice to unlock the doors.
Alrabady et al. [20] also analyze potential attacks on PKES
systems. The authors demonstrate several potential attacks
on passive entry systems and propose solutions to protect
vehicles from such attacks. However, to deploy these proposed
solutions, the frequency band of the key fob and the vehicle
would have to be altered, which forces the previous PKES
system to be re-designed. The same authors also analyzed
various types of security attacks against keyless entry systems
and compared the attacks in terms of the vulnerability of the
security mechanism deployed on the system, level of difﬁculty
to mount the attacks, and equipment needed for the attacks
[21]. Francillon et al. [38] pragmatically show a different type
of attack on PKES systems, the so-called relay attack. The
authors performed a comprehensive experiment and proposed
two types of attack scenarios: wired and wireless relay attacks.
In addition, [18] showed a similar but still different
type
of relay attack on PKES systems. In this work, adversaries
were presumed to be extracting binary codes from RF signals
and relaying these to another location. Although there is a
maximum receiving time delay allowance in the PKES system,
the authors showed that
it was possible to overcome this
constraint using cheap devices. Finally, in real car theft cases
[10], [13], it was revealed that the adversaries ampliﬁed both
the LF-band and UHF-band signals to mount a relay attack
known as an ampliﬁcation attack.
B. RF Device Fingerprinting
Depending on the signal region used to extract ﬁngerprints,
approaches can be categorized as transient-based, modulation-
based, or other approaches [32]. Transient-based approaches
use the turn-on/off transient of an RF signal for device iden-
tiﬁcation. This approach has been applied to the identiﬁcation
of VHF FM transceivers or intrusion detection in a WLAN
environment [36], [43]. However, transient signals have been
reportedly acquired at distances close to the front-end antenna
(10 ∼ 20cm), and this is unfeasible in keyless entry systems.
Modulation-based approaches extract features from the base
band signal. In this study, the classiﬁer achieves a classiﬁcation
error rate of 3% and 0.34% for the k-NN and SVM classiﬁers,
respectively. However, to achieve this error rate, a high-end

that we used the same values for the threshold, ΓP KES, as
used in other evaluations. As can be seen in Fig. 14, HODOR
displays weaker performance in dynamic environments than in
static environments. It seems that interference due to multipath
components affects the features that are analyzed in HODOR
even though their RF signals originate from a legitimated
key fob. However, we believe that this result is signiﬁcantly
meaningful, as it demonstrates that HODOR is able to identify a
legitimate key fob even within a dynamic environment. Finally,
we further evaluated feature importance under NLoS channel
conditions, including dynamic environments. In the results, the
peak frequency is the most salient feature followed by kurtosis,
SNR, and spectral brightness, in that order.
VI. RELATED WORKS
In this section, we introduce existing demonstrations of
attacks on keyless entry systems and device ﬁngerprint tech-
niques that have been proposed in previous studies.
A. Attacks on Keyless Entry Systems
Early keyless entry systems were designed without security
considerations. More speciﬁcally, RKE systems deployed in
Mercedes-Benz vehicles manufactured in the early 2000s still
used ﬁxed codes [40]. This means that these vehicles were
vulnerable to replay attacks. To prevent replay attacks, a
rolling code system using cryptography and a counter was
installed in the RKE system. Although the rolling code pro-
vides an adequate level of security, several studies [35], [48]
demonstrated the cryptographic weakness of the KEELOQ
system via a cryptographic analysis. For example, Garcia et al.
15
vector signal analyzer [12] is necessary for signal acquisition.
Other approaches considered other regions of the RF sig-
nals to extract the ﬁngerprints, such as the preamble of the
packet. As such, Suski et al. [60] proposed a power spectrum
density of the packet preamble to extract ﬁngerprints. Jun et
al. [46] also presented BlueID, which ﬁngerprints the clock
of a Bluetooth device. BlueID estimates the clock skew of a
Bluetooth device applying the Generalized Hough Transform
(GHT). In this work, 200 received preambles are required even
though the time-stamp value is not required to calculate a clock
skew. In a keyless entry system, however, the maximum ﬁve
preambles can be received for attack detection. Recently, the
authors of [27] proposed an RF-PUF which exploits the unique
hardware characteristics of an RF device to an authenticated
device. The main concept of HODOR is similar to that of
an RF-PUF, given that both analyze RF signals to develop
a security method, such as authentication or identiﬁcation.
However, in contrast to HODOR, multiple wireless devices used
in an RF-PUF were simulated based on software implemen-
tation. HODOR was evaluated using physical hardware rather
than simulations in environments while considering possible
scenarios in the PKES system.
A. HODOR and Security
VII. DISCUSSION
A threshold is a trade-off parameter in HODOR. If the output
score of a UHF-band signal and its features is larger than
the threshold, HODOR would determine that the signal is not
from a legitimate key fob. In addition, HODOR is designed
with a sufﬁciently large threshold so that it can tolerate some
degree of error. For example, the environments under an NLoS
channel and high-temperature variation cause a high noise
level, and HODOR should tolerate a feature variation that occurs
under these conditions. Because of this large threshold, on
the other hand, HODOR might accept a UHF-band signal even
if its features are not perfectly impersonated. We analyzed
the difﬁculties of feature impersonation to additionally discuss
HODOR’s security in the following subsection.
B. Feature Impersonation
Difﬁculty of feature impersonation is another crucial factor
in evaluating the security level of HODOR. Since HODOR
employs multiple features for attack detection, the degree of
feature impersonation difﬁculty should be discussed separately.
Peak frequency. The peak frequency represents the bit
time characteristics of an individual device. In a digital re-
lay attack and cryptographic attack, the peak frequency was
clearly different between attack signals and legitimate signals.
Because every RF device has a different bit time, it is possible
to identify RF devices based on their bit time. Moreover, the
peak frequency enables HODOR to identify RF devices even if
they have identical components with each other. On the other
hand, the playback attack that records and playbacks UHF-
band signals from a legitimate key fob is able to similarly
impersonate the peak frequency. However, even though the
peak frequency was successfully impersonated by the playback
attack,
it fails to impersonate the spectral brightness and
kurtosis which are affected by the ADC and DAC process.
SNR of a legitimate signal by using an ampliﬁer or by varying
the distance from the vehicle. However, the both methods
also affect kurtosis similar to the ways to impersonate the
peak frequency feature. Using an ampliﬁer especially increases
noise level as well as the baseband signal level. Due to this
ampliﬁed noise level, it is difﬁcult to impersonate kurtosis
while also impersonating SNR. In addition, channel condition
between the two adversaries affect the kurtosis feature. An
ideal analog ﬁlter would perfectly amplify only the baseband
signal level, and not noise level. However, it is very difﬁcult to
design the ideal analog ﬁlter in practice because of the analog
circuit complexity.
Spectral Brightness. The spectral brightness feature rep-
resents the amount of energy in a high-frequency region of
signals. This feature is very helpful to detect attacks where new
ADC and DAC processes occurs, such as in a playback attack.
However, the spectral brightness of each key fob has a similar
value. As a result, the attacks must be executed with identical
components as the target key fob in order to impersonate the
spectral brightness feature. However, different devices have
different bit times that are represented by the peak frequency
feature.
Kurtosis. The kurtosis feature was the most salient feature
across the series of evaluations. Although the kurtosis feature
is not helpful to detect the digital relay attack using identical
components (i.e., other key fobs), it outperforms when the
single-band relay attack and ampliﬁcation attack are detected.
However, the kurtosis feature of each key fob is similarly
distributed as spectral brightness. This implies that an attack
