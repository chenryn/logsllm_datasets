Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have a PHP file that calls a Python script and prints the output as follows:

```php
$output = shell_exec('/usr/bin/python hello.py');
echo $output;
```

The current output is:

```
b'total 16\ndrwx---r-x 2 oae users 4096 Jul 31 14:21 .\ndrwxr-x--x+ 9 oae root 4096 Jul 26 13:59 ..\n-rwx---r-x 1 oae users 90 Aug 3 11:22 hello.py\n-rwx---r-x 1 oae users 225 Aug 3 11:22 index.php\n'
```

However, I would like the output to be formatted as:

```
total 16K
drwx---r-x  2 oae users 4.0K Jul 31 14:21 ./
drwxr-x--x+ 9 oae root  4.0K Jul 26 13:59 ../
-rwx---r-x  1 oae users   90 Aug  3 11:22 hello.py*
-rwx---r-x  1 oae users  225 Aug  3 11:22 index.php*
```

Additionally, the `\n` characters should not be displayed. How can I achieve this?

One possible solution is to wrap the string in `<pre>` tags to preserve the formatting. However, I am looking for a more robust solution to handle the newline characters and format the output correctly.
