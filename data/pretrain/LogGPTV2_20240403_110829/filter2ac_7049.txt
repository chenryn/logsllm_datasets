**Title: Automation Techniques in C++ Reverse Engineering Using DLL Injection**

This presentation will explore various generic, automated dynamic analysis techniques that leverage DLL injection for type analysis during the reverse engineering of C++ code. Our primary focus will be on identifying the locations where structures are utilized within a C++ program throughout its execution, as well as determining the types of function arguments. The data collected through these methods can also provide valuable insights into inheritance and composition relationships, as well as subtype inference.

We will make the source code available, including the injected DLLs and data visualization plugins for IDA Pro and Hex-Rays, to facilitate further research and practical application.
