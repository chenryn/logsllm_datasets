titleblackhat:us-19 Automation Techniques in C++ Reverse Engineering
This presentation will discuss several generic, automated dynamic analysis techniques based on DLL injection for type analysis while reverse engineering C++ code. We focus on discovering the locations where structures are used within a C++ program throughout execution, as well as determining the types of function arguments. The data that we collect can also provide insight on inheritance and composition relationships, as well as subtype inference. Source code will be made available, including the injected DLLs and data visualization plugins for IDA and Hex-Rays.
