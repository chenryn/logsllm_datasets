TABLE I: Possible solutions and research directions
for victims [189]. At the same time, such research could help
an accused demonstrate that sexual abuse, in fact, did not
happen either because there was consent or because there was
no action by the accused that can be interpreted as sexual
abuse.
3) Reproducibility: Many characteristics worsen the impact
of revictimization for victims. As seen in §V-A1, the duplica-
tion and redistribution of the victim’s sexual content without
consent violates the victim’s privacy. Because reproducibility
is an inherent characteristic of technology, it may be difﬁcult
to address this challenge in the short term. Duplicated sexual
content could constitute pornography, and various ongoing
research is focused on reducing the speed of redistribution
of pornographic content [190]. To improve victims’ privacy
and help them have more control over their online sexual
content, future research, for instance, could look into methods
of notifying people about redistributed digital content that
includes them.
4) Issues of consent: In gathering evidence, victims lack
clarity on whether consent is needed to record the other party
sexually abusing them. Victims put their safety and lives at risk
without knowing if the recordings obtained without consent
will be accepted in court (§V-A1). We suggest the govern-
ment clariﬁes the state’s position on this [191]. For instance,
educational campaigns have been developed that explain what
constitutes consent in carrying out sexual activities [192]. Such
campaigns could also clarify exceptions to obtaining consent
prior to victims recording their sexual abuse incident.
In investigating gathered evidence, it is also difﬁcult to
determine if consent was given to engage in sexual activity.
It is even harder to determine if consent was initially given
and later revoked (§V-A1). While there are technological
solutions proposed to capture both parties’ consent before the
start of a sexual activity [193], they fail to capture revoked
consent [194]. Even though future research in technology
can look into capturing consent for the whole duration of
sexual activity, this may be a challenge beyond the scope
of technology. Other approaches may need to be explored in
combination with technology.
D. Reporting and preventing abuse (technological solutions)
We discuss how the characteristics of technology facili-
tate the challenges of using technological solutions. We also
discuss other challenges that are not linked to technological
characteristics and possible solutions to these challenges.
1) Multiple technological characteristics: Stakeholders
put the burden on the victim to stay safe by altering their use of
technology. This action supports victim blaming (see §V-B1).
Also, asking the victim to alter their use of technologies is
almost impossible due to its indispensability [39]. The concept
of digital minimalism [195], for instance, illustrates how difﬁ-
cult it is for people to do away with technology. The research
community could investigate ways of avoiding surveillance
without victims minimizing their use of technology.
Further, some characteristics of technology contribute to
security and privacy concerns around using solutions (see
Section IV). Because of the sensitive information that such
solutions would hold, solution providers should consider those
that provide high security and privacy for victims. Further,
solution providers should effectively communicate to victims
about their solutions’ security and privacy to reduce informa-
tion asymmetry.
2) Anonymity: Rather than visit a police station in person,
technological reporting solutions could help people report
sexual abuse incidents from the privacy of their homes [196].
Some stakeholders, however, fear an increase in false reporting
due to the anonymity that
technological solutions provide
(§V-B1). While this is a valid concern, compared to the
staggering ﬁndings that 95% of victims do not report being
sexually abused [197], addressing the assumption of false
reporting may currently be the wrong problem to address.
3) Alternative reporting paths: Most solutions provide
victims with one path to reporting with no alternatives, which
is rigid and problematic (e.g., when someone in a high ranking
position, such as a law enforcement agent or a support worker,
is the perpetrator). The information security principle Defence
in Depth calls for avoiding a single point of failure [183].
Solutions should be designed to have other paths for reporting
should one “fail.”
The research community could explore other pathways by
which victims can pursue justice. Digital activism, for exam-
ple, could be helpful in this regard; however, it has been known
to lead to revictimization [153]. Anonymous whistleblowing
could also help victims bypass an organization’s formal report-
ing structure and notify the authorities or upper management.
Liu [157] described a whistleblowing solution implemented
in the form of a Google spreadsheet that listed people who
have abused others in the media industry. This spreadsheet
was circulated among individuals in the industry to inform

others and add more names to the list. The solution, however,
faced three main problems: (i) it was not anonymous since
people could determine the originator of the list; (ii) people
were afraid of false reporting, which could immediately tarnish
the images of others; and (iii) such an approach did not help
the victims in their pursuit of justice. These are three main
challenges in using whistleblowing alternatives to reporting
that future research could address.
4) More effective technological solutions: Solutions have
low usability and lack personalization, risk assessment, evalua-
tion, and maintenance. Victims also do not know where to ﬁnd
solutions or that certain solutions exist (§V-B1). We discovered
two major reasons for the above issues: the lack of appropriate
revenue models and the failure to involve stakeholders in
solution development.
The revenue model for developing solutions for victims
needs to be rethought. Our results suggest victims found apps
that charged fees exploitative and were unwilling to pay for
them (§V-B1). It seems improper to charge someone in distress
to use technological solutions. However, the information mar-
ket is characterized by huge upfront investments in technology
design, though the marginal costs of scaling are almost negli-
gible [198], [198]. Typically, companies recover this money
through a number of revenue models such as subscription
services, advertising, freemium models, etc [199]. However,
these revenue models do not seem to work for solutions
assisting the targets of sexual abuse (§V-B1). For example, a
subscription service would seem inappropriate, asking people
to pay subscription fees pending a time they get abused and
can then use the solution to get justice. Currently, the most
optimal way to get resources to develop solutions is to apply
for funding from the government or other organizations [200].
However, the usage of this funding may be restricted to certain
conditions that guide the organization [200]. For more effec-
tive technological solutions to be developed and maintained,
research is needed for a revenue model where the developer
makes money to sustain and maintain the product while the
victims do not feel exploited.
Further, all stakeholders need to be in unison and be
involved in developing solutions. Our results show that the
development of solutions in isolation is problematic (§V-B1).
Stakeholders need to be on board for the technological solu-
tions to be trauma informed, effective, and not result in more
harm than good for victims [43].
E. Restricting abuse (government and service providers)
1) Uniform legislative laws: Laws vary across jurisdic-
tions, making it hard to hold perpetrators accountable. The
boundlessness of technology makes it possible for perpetrators
to meet people in various jurisdictions, commit sex crimes, and
return to their jurisdictions (§V-C1). For instance, one of the
most notorious serial rapists and murderers in Canada, Paul
Bernardo, was based in St. Catharines, ON, but was abusing
victims in Hamilton, ON. Contradictions in jurisdiction laws
in both cities made it harder to apprehend him [201]. Though
Bernardo’s situation was not technology facilitated, technology
opens up many more avenues for such abuse and presents
difﬁculties with arresting perpetrators. Researchers call for
more cohesive legislative laws, at least within countries [62],
[138]. Governments could consider such changes to facilitate
support for victims.
2) Increased service provider involvement: To shift the
responsibility of staying safe away from victims, service
providers need to get more involved and make technology
safer for victims to use (§V-C1). Some principles of designing
secure systems could be used as guidelines to help service
providers build better technologies that could reduce abuse for
victims. For instance, the Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults states
systems should be designed to be “fail-safe, meaning that they
fail ‘closed’ (denying access) rather than ‘open’ ” [183]. This
principle implies the default setting for any secured product
should be the safe option. For example, social media service
providers could consider making the default setting the more
private, restrictive option, whereby people cannot tag others
or post on other people’s social media walls or pages unless
the subject enables the setting. This setup could help reduce
the amount of public information a perpetrator can ﬁnd about
a victim.
Furthermore, in designing technologies service providers
could consider ways in which those technologies can be
misused by perpetrators and try to minimize that misuse.
Both Kadri and Uusitalo propose this approach to designing
everyday technologies and termed the approach empathy by
design [202] or safety by design [174]. While such technolog-
ical design may be unable to avoid every abuse use case, it
could go a long way in providing safer technological solutions
than currently exist.
VII. CONCLUSION
Our research offers the ﬁrst SoK on technology’s dual nature
in sexual abuse. We identify characteristics of technology
that facilitate abuse and report the challenges in providing
support for victims. Our ﬁndings suggest the governments,
stakeholders, technological service providers, and the research
community have a role in reducing abuse and supporting
victims of sexual abuse. Without active intervention, developed
solutions could result in more harm than help for victims.
As society’s reliance on technology increases, the need to
address the challenges of identifying, preventing, restricting,
and reporting abuse grows.
