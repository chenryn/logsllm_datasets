**Title: Black Hat Asia 2023 - Exploiting Managed Data Services in the Cloud**

The cloud has become the new operating system of the internet, with nearly all companies relying on it to host their workloads and data. While there is extensive discussion on how to configure and maintain secure public cloud environments, there is a relative lack of security research into the core cloud infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in these core services can have significant consequences for customers.

In this presentation, we will share our research that led to two major discoveries, both of which involved crossing tenant boundaries in services provided by the largest cloud vendors. We focused on two data integration services, where our exploits allowed us to obtain credentials to other customer accounts and execute code on remote machines.

We will delve into the nature of these new types of cloud provider service vulnerabilities, their anatomy, and the implications. We will also explore how seemingly simple vulnerabilities can lead to substantial impacts, and why, despite these risks, it remains advantageous to be a cloud customer.
