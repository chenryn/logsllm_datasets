User: My question is the following, I have sublime 2 and sublime repl plugin installed all working fine, the only thing i need is to change the version of python that is running on the sublimerepl built in console. What I mean is, I have python 2.7.5 (which is pre installed with maveriks) running fine in sublime (via sublimerepl), and I have installed via the installer from python.org, python 3.3.3 , that I need to use, I want to run this version of python on the sublimerepl console but I don't know how.
I know that there are alternatives to sublime but none of those are so beautiful as sublime is.
Can someone help me with this ? I've searched for all over the internet and couldn't find anything helpful.
Btw if I use terminal python 3.3.3 is working fine (Terminal>'python3'), I know this is possible beacause a friend of mine got it working and I have installed mine like he did, but mine is not working.
Assistant: I would suggest to change the directory to
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
This way whenever you update python, SublimeREPL will always get the updated version.
