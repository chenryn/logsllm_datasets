**Question:**

I am currently using Sublime Text 2 with the SublimeREPL plugin, and everything is working well. However, I need to change the Python version that runs in the SublimeREPL built-in console.

Currently, I have Python 2.7.5 (which comes pre-installed with macOS Mavericks) running in SublimeREPL. I have also installed Python 3.3.3 from the official Python website, and I need to use this version in the SublimeREPL console. I am unsure how to switch the Python version in SublimeREPL.

While there are other alternatives to Sublime Text, I prefer its aesthetics and functionality. Could someone please assist me with this? I have searched extensively online but have not found a solution.

For context, when I use the terminal, Python 3.3.3 works fine by typing `python3`. I know it is possible to configure SublimeREPL to use Python 3.3.3 because a friend of mine has successfully done so, and I followed the same installation steps, but it is not working for me.

**Assistant:**

To ensure that SublimeREPL uses the correct version of Python, you can update the path to the Python executable. I recommend changing the directory to:

```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
```

This way, whenever you update Python, SublimeREPL will automatically use the updated version.
