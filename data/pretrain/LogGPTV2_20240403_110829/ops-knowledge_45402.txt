User: So, I'm learning Python and would like to create a simple script to download a file from the internet and then write it to a file. However, I am using IDLE and have no idea what the working directory is in IDLE or how to change it. How can I do file system stuff in IDLE if I don't know the working directory or how to change it?
Assistant: Old question I know but maybe the OP's question was not answered? If you want Idle's File Open/Save/Save As menu items to interact with a particular folder, you need to set the CWD before starting Idle. So, assuming you have a folder on Windows "C:\Users<username>\Documents\python\my_project", then at a cmd prompt type cd C:\Users\<username>\Documents\python\my_project and then start Idle
