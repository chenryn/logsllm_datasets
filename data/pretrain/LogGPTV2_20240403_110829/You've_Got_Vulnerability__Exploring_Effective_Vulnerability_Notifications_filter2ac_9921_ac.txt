Figure 2: Differences between National CERTs—We show the remediation rate for each directly notiﬁed national
CERT after two weeks. The size of a data point is proportional to the number of abuse contacts in the country. We
directly contacted 32 CERTs for IPv6, and 29 CERTs for ICS. We observe notable differences between CERT groups.
However, none are statistically signiﬁcantly different than the control group. This may be because there are too few
hosts for some countries, and that the Bonferroni correction is conservative.
CERT groups or notify any US operators. One national
CERT included in the report to US-CERT informed us
they had not received any notices from US-CERT. As
seen in Figure 2, there were stark differences between
CERT groups—some duly notiﬁed operators, while oth-
ers appear to have ignored our disclosures.
Overall,
this
suggests
the most effective
approach—in terms of both the number of hosts patched
and the rate of patching—is to directly notify network
operators rather than contact CERT groups.

pairwise comparisons includes 15 tests, giving an indi-
vidual test threshold of α = 0.0033. Under the permu-
tation test, the gains that direct verbose notiﬁcations had
on the CERTs and the control group are statistically sig-
niﬁcant for both IPv6 and ICS, with all p-values less than
0.0001 except when comparing ICS verbose notiﬁcations
with national CERTs (p = 0.0027).
Notably, US-CERT—our local CERT who we asked to
disseminate data to other CERT groups—had the lowest
patch rate, which is statistically indistinguishable from
the control group that had no notiﬁcations. We suspect
that US-CERT did not disseminate the data to any other
4.2 Message Verbosity
To determine what information needs to be included in
notiﬁcation messages, we sent three types of emails: (1)
verbose, (2) terse, and (3) terse with a link to a website
with additional details. We observed the best remediation
by contacts who received verbose messages. For IPv6,
verbose messages were 56.5% more effective than either
terse messages after two days and 55.5% more effective
for ICS. However, as can be seen in Figure 1, the dif-
ferences between verbose and terse messages decreased
over time.
Using permutation testing and the Bonferroni correc-
tion, we ﬁnd that the differences between the message
types are not statistically signiﬁcant for IPv6 and ICS.
However, given the earlier beneﬁts that verbose mes-
sages had for both data sets, we argue notiﬁers may still
want to prefer verbose messages over terse ones. We dis-
cuss this effect further in Section 4.4 and note that further
investigation of this variable is warranted.
We tracked the remediation rate of contacts who vis-
ited the linked website, as shown in Figure 3. We note
that all of the information included in the verbose mes-
sage was available on the linked website and that 16.8%
of users who received an email with a link visited the site.
This indicates that a sizable population of users engaged

ing the link. Speciﬁcally, no more than 40% of website
visitors patched. Thus, even when our messages success-
fully reached contacts, the majority did not take action.
speaking countries for the ICS dataset was too low to pro-
vide signiﬁcant meaning. We randomly split the WHOIS
contacts in each country into four groups that vary lan-
guage and verbosity.
4.3 Message Language
To investigate whether notiﬁcations need to be translated
into recipients’ local languages or can be sent in English,
we distributed translated messages for two countries for
DDoS and IPv6 notiﬁcations. For DDoS ampliﬁers, we
obtained native Russian and Polish translations—for the
countries with the third and fourth largest number of vul-
nerable organizations. For IPv6, we translated messages
into German and Dutch, for the second and third largest
countries. The population of contacts in non-English
We observe no signiﬁcant effect from language for
DDoS notiﬁcations. This is unsurprising given our no-
tiﬁcations’ overall lack of effect on DDoS ampliﬁers.
For IPv6, as seen in Figure 4, we observe that trans-
lated messages resulted in worse patching than when left
in English. Several survey respondents were surprised
at receiving translated messages from United States in-
stitutions and initially suspected our notiﬁcations were
phishing messages or spam, which may explain the lower
patch rate. The additional overhead of translating mes-
sages paired with less successful disclosure suggests that
it may be most effective to send notiﬁcations in English.

Figure 7: Protocol Remediation Rates—We track the remediation rate for each speciﬁc protocol within the WHOIS
verbose group and the control group. We note that operators patched some protocols signiﬁcantly faster than others
(e.g., Telnet versus FTP).
However, we note that our results are limited to the small
set of languages we were able to obtain reliable trans-
lations for, and deeper investigation into the effects of
message language is warranted.
4.4 Staying Power of Notiﬁcation’s Effect
As can be seen in Figure 5, our notiﬁcations caused
a near immediate increase in patching. However, this
increased patching velocity did not persist.
In other
words, we ﬁnd that the effects of notiﬁcations were short-
lived—on the order of several days. The day after noti-
ﬁcations were sent, we observe large increases in the re-
mediation proportions for IPv6 and ICS notiﬁed groups,
as operators responded to our reports. However, we also
see that the daily changes in remediation proportions
drastically dropped by the second day.
For IPv6, the daily changes in remediation proportions

for all notiﬁed groups leveled off and matched that of the
control group from the ﬁfth day onward. We also witness
a drop off in the daily remediation proportion changes
for ICS, although a non-trivial amount of change contin-
ued throughout the ﬁrst 10 days. Notably, the national
CERTs ﬁrst began accelerating remediation after two
days, a delay compared to WHOIS experiment groups.
For ampliﬁers, there was little change in the remediation
rate over time, which is unsurprising given the limited
effect of our notiﬁcations.
4.5 Geographic Variation
As with the national CERTs, we note variation in the
patching rates between countries. This suggests that the
geographic distribution of vulnerable contacts may inﬂu-
ence a notiﬁcation’s outcome. As visible in Figure 6,
the United States, Great Britain, India, and Finland were
the only countries that patched signiﬁcantly better than
the control group. However, we note that some countries
had too few hosts to be statistically signiﬁcant, given the
conservative nature of the Bonferroni correction.
4.6 Variation over Protocols
In Figure 7, we observe variation in the patch rates for
different protocols within each vulnerability (e.g., Mod-
bus versus S7 for ICS). As seen in Figure 7a, network
administrators reacted most to open IPv6 NTP, Telnet,
and SSH services, and least to FTP, with over a 200%
difference in the remediation proportions. This variation
is not reﬂected in the control group (Figure 7d), where
all protocols exhibited similar behavior. This may reﬂect
an increased likelihood that certain services were unin-
tentionally left accessible, or that operators assessed dif-
ferent levels of risk for allowing different protocols to be
reachable.
Operators also responded differently for the multi-
ple ICS protocols (Figure 7c), but the variation is also
reﬂected for contacts in the control group (Figure 7f).
BACnet, Fox, and Modbus devices were ﬁxed at simi-
lar rates. While the remediation of S7 systems initially
lagged behind, there was a signiﬁcant upswing in action
after three days, with nearly 18% of contacts with vul-
nerable S7 systems patching after 8 days.
Surprisingly, no DNP3 systems had been patched
within 10 days of notiﬁcation (out of 5 contacts). We
note that these ﬁve contact groups belonged to Inter-
net service providers—not individual organizations. We
similarly note that DNP3 differs from the other pro-
tocols and is speciﬁcally intended for power grid au-
tomation. These devices may be remote power stations
which require more complex changes than local devices

(e.g., installation of new hardware versus a conﬁguration
change).
While we observe variation between ampliﬁer proto-
cols, these ﬂuctuations are similar in both the notiﬁed
and control group. Given the limited effect of our DDoS
ampliﬁer notiﬁcations, these differences likely reﬂect the
varying natural churn rates of these hosts.
4.7 Host Type
When notifying IPv6 operators, we were able to distin-
guish between servers and routers. To assess the differ-
ence between device types, for each type, we only con-
sider contacts with a vulnerable host of that type. We
count a contact as having performed some remediation if
that contact ﬁxed at least one host of that type.

Figure 10: Re-Notiﬁcations—We ﬁnd that a second round of notiﬁcations did not result in increased remediation.
We observe that servers and routers remediated at sim-
ilar rates for the ﬁrst four days, after which router re-
mediation dropped off and fell signiﬁcantly below that
of servers (Figure 8a). However, servers also naturally
patched at a higher rate than routers in the control group.
This difference accounts for the gap between notiﬁed
servers and routers after four days. This is also visible
in Figure 8b, where the daily changes in the remediation
proportions converged after four days. After 14 days,
notiﬁed contacts with servers ﬁxed at a rate 44% higher
than notiﬁed contacts with routers. The divergence in
the control group was similar at 48%. This indicates that
overall, network administrators respond to vulnerabili-
ties in servers and routers about equally.
4.8 Degree of Remediation
Up to this point, we designated a contact as having
patched if any host under its purview was patched. We
now consider how well operators patched their hosts.
As can be seen in Figure 9, the majority of contacts did
not patch all of their servers. Less than 60% secured all
hosts and we note that 30% of groups with 100% reme-
diation were only responsible for ﬁxing one or two hosts.
This highlights one of the challenges in the vulnerability
notiﬁcation process: even if our messages reach a desig-
nated contact, that contact may not have the capabilities
or permissions to remediate all hosts. The multiple hops
in a communication chain can be broken at any link.
4.9 Repeated Notiﬁcations
Given that our notiﬁcations resulted in improved patch-
ing, a natural question is whether repeat notiﬁcations
promote further remediation. We conducted a second
round of notiﬁcations for the contacts that were directly
sent verbose messages in the ﬁrst round since these
proved to be the most effective. We randomly split con-
tacts who had not remediated one month after our notiﬁ-
cations into two groups, one as a control group and one
to receive a second round of notiﬁcations.
As can be seen in Figure 10, the patch rates between
the re-notiﬁed group and the control group were similar
for all three vulnerabilities, indicating that repeat notiﬁ-
cations are not effective. This suggests that contacts who
did not remediate during the ﬁrst round of notiﬁcations

either were not the appropriate points of contact, or chose
(either intentionally or due to lack of capabilities) to not
remediate.
It is unlikely they simply missed or forgot
about our original notiﬁcation.
5 Notiﬁcation Reactions
We included a link to an anonymous survey in all of our
notiﬁcation emails as well as monitored the email ad-
dress from which we sent messages. In the two weeks
following our disclosures, we received 57 survey sub-
missions and 93 human email replies. In this section, we
analyze these responses.
5.1 Email Responses
Of the 685 email responses we received, 530 (77%) were
automated responses (e.g., acknowledgment of receipt),
62 (9%) were bounces, and 93 (14%) were human re-
sponses (Table 3). For all three vulnerabilities, over 70%
of the human responses expressed positive sentiments.
We received only four negative emails, all of which con-
cerned IPv6. Two stated that we were incorrectly us-
ing the abuse contact; the other two noted that the open
IPv6 services were intentional and asked to be excluded
from notiﬁcations in the future. None of the emails were
threatening. We detail the breakdown for each vulnera-
bility type in Table 4.
Beyond expressing sentiments, 23 contacts requested
information—primarily about how we de-
additional
tected the vulnerabilities; two requested remediation in-
structions. Of those 23 contacts, 15 (65%) received
terse notiﬁcations without a link to additional informa-
tion, while 3 contacts (13%) received verbose messages.
We note that verbose messages both reduced follow-up
communication and resulted in the highest patching rate.
Unexpectedly, all ﬁve contacts who requested infor-
mation about DDoS ampliﬁers asked for evidence of
DDoS attacks via network logs. This may be a result
of the extensive attention ampliﬁers have received in the
past, such that operators only respond to active abuse is-
sues regarding ampliﬁers.
Twelve IPv6 contacts rebutted our claim of vulnerabil-
ity. Six stated that the inconsistency was intentional; one
was a honeypot; and ﬁve explained that the IP addresses
we sent them no longer pointed to the same dual-stack
host, likely due to network churn. Two ampliﬁer contacts
claimed we falsely notiﬁed, stating that their hosts were
honeypots. However, we do note that these IPs were seen
as part of an attack and were therefore likely misconﬁg-
ured honeypots.
Most human responses were in English, with eight
(9%) in other languages: 3 Russian, 1 German, 1 Czech,
1 Swedish, 1 French, and 1 Slovak. These non-English
