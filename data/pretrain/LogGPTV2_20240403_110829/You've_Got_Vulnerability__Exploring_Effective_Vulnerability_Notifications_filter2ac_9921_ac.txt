**Figure 2: Differences in National CERT Remediation Rates**

- **Description**: The figure illustrates the remediation rates for each directly notified national CERT after two weeks. The size of each data point is proportional to the number of abuse contacts in the country.
- **Data Points**:
  - **IPv6**: 32 CERTs
  - **ICS Services**: 29 CERTs
- **Observations**:
  - There are notable differences between CERT groups.
  - None of the differences are statistically significant compared to the control group, possibly due to a small number of hosts in some countries and the conservative nature of the Bonferroni correction.

**Additional Context**:
- One national CERT included in the report to US-CERT informed us that they had not received any notices from US-CERT.
- As shown in Figure 2, there were stark differences between CERT groups—some duly notified operators, while others appeared to have ignored our disclosures.
- Overall, this suggests that the most effective approach, in terms of both the number of hosts patched and the rate of patching, is to directly notify network operators rather than contact CERT groups.

#### Figure 3: Remediation Rates for Website Visitors

- **Description**: Contacts who viewed our informational website remediated at a higher rate than those who received a verbose message. However, less than 40% of the contacts who visited the site fixed the vulnerability.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Pairwise comparisons include 15 tests, with an individual test threshold of α = 0.0033.
  - Under the permutation test, the gains from direct verbose notifications on the CERTs and the control group are statistically significant for both IPv6 and ICS, with all p-values less than 0.0001 except when comparing ICS verbose notifications with national CERTs (p = 0.0027).

**Notable Findings**:
- US-CERT, our local CERT, had the lowest patch rate, which was statistically indistinguishable from the control group that had no notifications.
- We suspect that US-CERT did not disseminate the data to other CERTs.

#### 4.2 Message Verbosity

- **Objective**: To determine the necessary information for notification messages.
- **Methods**:
  - Sent three types of emails: (1) verbose, (2) terse, and (3) terse with a link to a website with additional details.
- **Results**:
  - Verbose messages were more effective:
    - **IPv6**: 56.5% more effective than terse messages after two days.
    - **ICS**: 55.5% more effective than terse messages.
  - Over time, the differences between verbose and terse messages decreased (Figure 1).
- **Statistical Significance**:
  - Using permutation testing and the Bonferroni correction, the differences between message types were not statistically significant for IPv6 and ICS.
  - Despite this, we argue that notifiers may still prefer verbose messages over terse ones, given the earlier benefits observed.

**Website Engagement**:
- Tracked the remediation rate of contacts who visited the linked website (Figure 3).
- 16.8% of users who received an email with a link visited the site, indicating that a sizable population engaged with the site but many did not patch even after visiting the link.

#### 4.3 Message Language

- **Objective**: To investigate whether notifications need to be translated into recipients' local languages or can be sent in English.
- **Methods**:
  - Distributed translated messages for two countries for DDoS and IPv6 notifications.
  - For DDoS amplifiers, obtained native Russian and Polish translations.
  - For IPv6, translated messages into German and Dutch.
- **Results**:
  - No significant effect from language for DDoS notifications.
  - For IPv6, translated messages resulted in worse patching than when left in English (Figure 4).
  - Some survey respondents suspected phishing or spam upon receiving translated messages, which may explain the lower patch rate.

**Conclusion**:
- It may be most effective to send notifications in English, given the additional overhead of translation and the lower success rate.

#### 4.4 Staying Power of Notification’s Effect

- **Description**: Our notifications caused a near-immediate increase in patching, but this increased velocity did not persist (Figure 5).
- **Observations**:
  - Large increases in remediation proportions for IPv6 and ICS notified groups on the day after notifications.
  - Daily changes in remediation proportions dropped drastically by the second day.
  - For IPv6, the daily changes in remediation proportions for all notified groups leveled off and matched that of the control group from the fifth day onward.
  - For ICS, a non-trivial amount of change continued throughout the first 10 days.
  - National CERTs began accelerating remediation after two days, a delay compared to WHOIS experiment groups.

#### 4.5 Geographic Variation

- **Description**: Patching rates varied between countries, suggesting that the geographic distribution of vulnerable contacts may influence a notification's outcome (Figure 6).
- **Significant Countries**:
  - United States, Great Britain, India, and Finland patched significantly better than the control group.
  - Some countries had too few hosts to be statistically significant, given the conservative nature of the Bonferroni correction.

#### 4.6 Variation over Protocols

- **Description**: Observed variation in patch rates for different protocols within each vulnerability (Figure 7).
- **Examples**:
  - **IPv6**: Network administrators reacted most to open NTP, Telnet, and SSH services, and least to FTP.
  - **ICS**: BACnet, Fox, and Modbus devices were fixed at similar rates, while S7 systems initially lagged but saw a significant upswing after three days.
  - **DDoS Amplifiers**: No DNP3 systems were patched within 10 days, likely due to their specific use in power grid automation.

#### 4.7 Host Type

- **Description**: Assessed the difference in remediation rates between servers and routers.
- **Methods**:
  - Only considered contacts with a vulnerable host of that type.
- **Results**:
  - Servers and routers remediated at similar rates for the first four days, after which router remediation dropped off (Figure 8a).
  - After 14 days, notified contacts with servers fixed at a rate 44% higher than those with routers.
  - This indicates that overall, network administrators respond to vulnerabilities in servers and routers about equally.

#### 4.8 Degree of Remediation

- **Description**: Considered how well operators patched their hosts.
- **Results**:
  - The majority of contacts did not patch all of their servers (Figure 9).
  - Less than 60% secured all hosts, and 30% of groups with 100% remediation were only responsible for fixing one or two hosts.
  - This highlights the challenge in the vulnerability notification process: designated contacts may not have the capabilities or permissions to remediate all hosts.

#### 4.9 Repeated Notifications

- **Objective**: To determine if repeat notifications promote further remediation.
- **Methods**:
  - Conducted a second round of notifications for contacts who were directly sent verbose messages in the first round.
- **Results**:
  - The patch rates between the re-notified group and the control group were similar for all three vulnerabilities, indicating that repeat notifications are not effective (Figure 10).
  - Suggests that contacts who did not remediate during the first round either were not the appropriate points of contact or chose not to remediate.

#### 5 Notiﬁcation Reactions

- **Survey and Email Responses**:
  - Included a link to an anonymous survey in all notification emails.
  - Monitored the email address from which we sent messages.
  - Received 57 survey submissions and 93 human email replies.

**Email Response Breakdown**:
- **Automated Responses**: 530 (77%)
- **Bounces**: 62 (9%)
- **Human Responses**: 93 (14%)

**Sentiments**:
- Over 70% of human responses expressed positive sentiments.
- Four negative emails, all concerning IPv6.
- 23 contacts requested additional information, primarily about how we detected the vulnerabilities.
- Verbose messages reduced follow-up communication and resulted in the highest patching rate.

**Unexpected Findings**:
- All five contacts who requested information about DDoS amplifiers asked for evidence of DDoS attacks via network logs.
- Twelve IPv6 contacts rebutted our claim of vulnerability, with various explanations.

**Language of Responses**:
- Most responses were in English, with 8 (9%) in other languages: 3 Russian, 1 German, 1 Czech, 1 Swedish, 1 French, and 1 Slovak.
