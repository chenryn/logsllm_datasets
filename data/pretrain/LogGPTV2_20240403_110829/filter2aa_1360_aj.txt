To install the "Preferred Installer Program" (PIP), which is essential for managing Python packages, enter the following command into the Terminal. This will configure PIP for the current default version of Python (3) in Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

With PIP and other necessary utilities installed, you are now prepared to handle media-related tasks. Although these initial steps may not yield immediate, visible results, they lay the foundation for future scripting activities.

### YouTube-DL Installation and Usage

#### Installing YouTube-DL

To install YouTube-DL, use the following command. The `sudo -H` part ensures that the installation occurs with elevated privileges but as the current home user (`osint`), preventing potential issues with core functionality:

```bash
sudo -H pip install youtube-dl
```

#### Downloading a Single Video

Assume you want to download a high-quality video from Bob Ross's YouTube channel. After navigating to the desired video page (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQdO), use the following command to download it:

```bash
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQdO --all-subs
```

This command will download the video and its subtitles, saving them to your current directory. To change the save location to your desktop, use:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQdO --all-subs
```

#### Bulk Downloads and Automation

For bulk downloads, such as downloading all videos from a channel (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc/videos), use:

```bash
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc/videos --all-subs
```

To automate this process and simplify usage, you can create a script. Hereâ€™s an example script that prompts the user for a URL and downloads the video to a specified folder:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
timestamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M)
url=$(zenity --entry --title "Video Downloader" --text "Target URL:")
youtube-dl "$url" -o ~/Videos/Youtube-DL/"$timestamp_%(title)s.%(ext)s" -i --all-subs
zenity --progress --pulsate --no-cancel --auto-close --title="Video Downloader" --text="Video being saved to ~/Videos/Youtube-DL/"
nautilus ~/Videos/
exit
```

Save this script as `youtubedl.sh` on your desktop and make it executable:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
chmod +x youtubedl.sh
./youtubedl.sh
```

To avoid opening the Terminal each time, create a `.desktop` file to launch the script from the Dock:

1. Open the Applications menu and launch Text Editor.
2. Enter the following text and save the file as `youtubedl.desktop` on your Desktop:

    ```ini
    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=Application
    Name=Video Download
    Categories=Application;OSINT
    Exec=/home/osint/Documents/scripts/youtubedl.sh
    Icon=/home/osint/Documents/icons/youtube-dl.png
    Terminal=true
    ```

3. Move the `.desktop` file to the applications directory:

    ```bash
    sudo mv youtubedl.desktop /usr/share/applications/
    ```

4. Create the necessary folders and move the script and icon files:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/Documents/scripts
    mkdir -p ~/Documents/icons
    mv ~/Desktop/youtubedl.sh ~/Documents/scripts/
    cp /path/to/icon/youtube-dl.png ~/Documents/icons/
    ```

### Additional Features

You can enhance the script with additional features, such as downloading all comments from a video or exporting video page information. For example, to export all subtitles with timestamps:

```bash
yttool -v --subtitles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQdO > subs.txt
```

To export video page information:

```bash
yttool --info https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLWEXRAnQdO > info.txt
```

To export details of all videos in a playlist:

```bash
yttool --playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAEQD0ULngi67rwmhrkNjMZKvyCReqDV4 > playlist.txt
```

These commands and scripts provide a robust framework for handling various media tasks, making your workflow more efficient and user-friendly.
