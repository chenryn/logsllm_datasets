When binding to a list or map in a form tag, in my case:
The checkbox is correctly bound and rendered (using a custom property editors
etc), however on submission the request parameters are not correctly bound to
the form object. After investigation it appears that the HTML "name" attribute
of the input field is incorrect, before 3.0.1 (RELEASE-A) it would render:
It now renders:
    // Note the missing square brackets in the name
I am aware that in 2.5 the "id" attribute of input fields were changed to
remove the square brackets [ and ]. However it seems that the "name" also has
these removed causing the request parameters to not be bound on submission of
the form. Manually editing the HTML to include the [ and ] characters in the
"name" attribute fixes the issue.
Although I have found this in using the portlet API and the form:checkboxes/
tag, I suspect that it is common in the servlet code (and other form tags) too
- it seems to be in AbstractDataBoundFormElementTag:
In 3.0.0 (working):
    	protected String autogenerateId() throws JspException {
    		return StringUtils.deleteAny(getName(), "[]");
    	}
    	protected String getName() throws JspException {
    		return getPropertyPath();
    	}
In 3.0.1 RELEASE A:
    	protected String autogenerateId() throws JspException {
    		return getName();
    	}
    	protected String getName() throws JspException {
    		return StringUtils.deleteAny(getPropertyPath(), "[]");
    	}
Please feel free to shoot me down - I have spent a while on this and I cant
see how the above is supposed to work.
