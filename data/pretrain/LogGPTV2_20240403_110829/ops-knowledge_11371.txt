User: An existing Java application needs to periodically execute some important business logic through scheduled tasks, and each execution requires about 1GB of memory. Please provide a reasonable scheduled task scheduling scheme for the application.
Assistant: You can use Java's built-in ScheduledExecutorService to implement scheduled task scheduling. Whenever executing business logic, use JVM parameters to set maximum memory limit to prevent out of memory. The following is a sample code: ```java import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class TaskScheduler { private static final long INITIAL_DELAY = 0; private static final long PERIOD = 1; private static final TimeUnit TIME_UNIT = TimeUnit.HOURS; private static final long MAX_MEMORY = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; public static void main(String[] args) { ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors .newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();executor .scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> { // Set the maximum memory Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory(MAX_MEMORY); // Execute business logic // ... }, INITIAL_DELAY, PERIOD, TIME_UNIT); } } ``` the code The business logic will be executed every hour, and the maximum memory of the JVM will be set to 1GB before each execution.
