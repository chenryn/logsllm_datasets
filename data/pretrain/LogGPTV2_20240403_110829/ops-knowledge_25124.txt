User: The company's projects need to implement multilingual support, and multilingual texts need to be stored in the database or file system. Please provide a reasonable solution for multilingual support.
Assistant: feasible multi-language support solution is to use JSON files or database tables corresponding to languages to store multi-language texts, and a centralized language configuration file can be used in the application. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1. Create a language configuration file (such as language.json), which contains the list of supported languages and the default language. For example: { "supported_languages": ["en-US", "zh-CN", "es-ES"], "default_language": "en-US" } 2. Create a multilingual text storage file, such as language_en- US.json, language_zh-CN.json, language_es-ES.json. In these files, the text for each language is stored in JSON format. For example: { "hello_world": "Hello, World!", "welcome_message": "Welcome to our website!" } 3. In the application, read the language configuration file and the multilingual text storage file and cache them in in memory or stored in a global variable. When the user needs to switch languages, update the default language and refresh the multilingual text. 4. In the application, in order to facilitate the use of multilingual text, you can create a public method or class to obtain multilingual text. For example: function getText(key) { const currentLanguage = getCurrentLanguage(); const languageFile = readLanguageFile(currentLanguage); return languageFile[key]; } This method can be used in multiple places in the application, such as in the interface, mail, log, etc. and so on. With this approach, we can easily switch between multilingual texts, while managing and maintaining them conveniently. In conclusion, a multi-language support solution using JSON files and a centralized language configuration file is very practical. This solution can not only help us easily implement multilingual support in the application, but also facilitate the management and maintenance of multilingual texts.
