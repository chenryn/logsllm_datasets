rules, as explained in Section 4.3.
Furthermore, there is no limit on the number of offers a filtering
network can make. However, to simplify this selection process by
reducing the total number of offers that a defense agent must con-
sider, we restrict the number of offers a defense agent can select per
filtering network to one. This constraint, however, does not nega-
tively affect the overall efficacy of the defense because a filtering
network can make offers in such a way as to represent all possible
combinations of rules that it is willing to deploy. For example, if a
filtering network is willing to deploy rules x, y, and z, but, due to
resource limitations, can only deploy a maximum of two rules, it
could make 6 different offers: {x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y}, {x, z}, and {y, z}. To
reduce the overhead of sending these combinations of offers to the
defense agent, the filtering network can simply notify the defense
agent that it is willing to deploy any offer with maximum rule size
of two that includes rules x, y, and z, along with the price of each
rule (so that the defense agent can calculate the price of each offer).
Once the filtering networks make their offers, the defense agent
then selects which offers to buy, among all filtering networks, that
will most effectively mitigate the attack, given a limited budget and
threshold amount of collateral damage that it is willing to incur.
Note, measuring the exact collateral damage an offer will incur
is difficult and dependent on the type of rules that are deployed.
For example, for rules based on a source IP prefix, the amount of
collateral damage may be difficult to measure, but the number of
legitimate sources that may potentially be affected by those rules
can easily be calculated. Once the offers are selected, the filtering
networks that provided those offers will deploy the rules pertaining
to those offers in their networks to mitigate the attack. The cycle
of generating, selecting, and deploying rules will continue until the
attack is mitigated.

3.3 The Rule Space Constraint in In-Network
Filtering and the Need for Rule Selection
Although source IP-based filtering rules allow the defense agent
more fine-grained filtering of DDoS traffic, a significant drawback
to this method of filtering is the limited number of rules that can
be deployed at defending networks. This limitation is caused by
the scarcity of memory space on routers and switches for deploy-
ing filtering rules. Specifically, network routers rely on expensive
ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) to forward or dis-
card traffic with low latency, and most high-end routers today only
have enough TCAM space to support a few thousand filtering rules
without significantly reducing performance [3, 6, 40].
The problem of limited memory space for filtering rules is com-
pounded by the sheer scale of botnets today. The Mirai botnet was
found to have control over 50 million unique IP addresses spread
all across the world [11]. A victim who is under attack from such a
large portion of the Internet simply cannot deploy a filtering rule
for each /32 IP address. In fact, even deploying /32 filtering rules
(a /32 rule refers to a rule that drops traffic from a specific /32 IP
address, thereby achieving the finest filtering granularity possible)
to filter a portion of Mirai’s IP addresses would cost an astronomical
amount of money, assuming the victim would have to pay for each
rule deployed on each defending network’s routers.
Therefore, the victim would need to aggregate /32 prefix rules
into more coarse-grained prefixes (e.g., /24 or /16), in order to
reduce the number of rules deployed. However, by doing so, the
victim loses the ability to prevent filtering legitimate traffic, or
incurring collateral damage, that may originate from legitimate
source IPs within the more coarse-grained prefixes. In fact, there
are examples of DDoS attacks that try to exploit this problem, one of
which was proposed in recent literature [43]. Furthermore, recent
studies attempt to analyze how in-network DDoS defense solutions
attempt to handle this problem, albeit not from a rule selection
perspective [49].
Another factor to consider in the problem of balancing collateral
damage and monetary cost, is the location at which offers are
made, and ultimately, where rules are deployed. The location of
defending ASes chosen for filtering affects the collateral damage
and monetary cost incurred by a victim. For example, the closer
defending ASes are to the attack sources, the victim has a lower
chance of incurring collateral damage, but will probably incur a
relatively large monetary cost due to more rules being deployed.
On the other hand, the closer defending ASes are to the victim, the
victim has a higher chance of incurring collateral damage, but will
probably incur a relatively small monetary cost. Fig. 3 depicts how
the location of deployed rules can impact the collateral damage
and monetary cost incurred by a victim. If filtering rules were to
be deployed as close to the attack sources as possible, as seen in
Fig. 3a, the victim could deploy /32-granular rules at each source AS,
thereby dropping all attack traffic, without incurring any collateral
damage (only attack flows A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6 would be
dropped). However, the victim would need to deploy a total of 6
separate rules (corresponding to each attack flow) at ASes 1, 2, 7,
3, 9, and 4. If the rules were to be deployed on ASes somewhere
between the attack sources and victim (e.g., at ASes 11, 12, 13, and
14), as seen in Fig. 3b, the victim could deploy a more coarse-grained
rule at ASes 12 to filter A2 and A3, and another coarse-grained rule
at AS 13 to filter A4 and A5. The victim could still deploy two /32-
granular rules at AS 11 and 14 to filter A1 and A6, respectively.
Therefore, the victim would only need to deploy a total of 4 rules,
instead of 6. However, the coarse-grained rules at AS 12 and 13 may
also filter legitimate flows L1 and L2, causing collateral damage.
Finally, if filtering rules were deployed at the victim’s AS, as seen
in Fig. 3c, then the victim, at the very least, could deploy 1 very
coarse-grained rule to filter all of the attack traffic. However, this
coarse-grained rule could also filter L3 (along with L1 and L2),
causing even more collateral damage than the previous scenario
(of Fig. 3b). Note also that under link-flooding attacks, where a link
several hops upstream to the victim is DDoSed, deploying filtering
rules at the victim will be futile, and instead, filtering rules must be
deployed further upstream to alleviate the attacked link.
The conundrum of balancing the cost of filtering legitimate traffic
with the cost of deploying filtering rules leads to an interesting,
and not well-studied optimization problem: maximize the amount
of DDoS traffic filtered, while limiting the amount of collateral
damage incurred and money spent on deploying filtering rules. In
the next section, we formalize this optimization problem, which we
call the rule selection problem.

4 RULE SELECTION PROBLEM DEFINITION
4.1 Overview
After the defense agent generates rules and the DDoS-filtering
networks provide offers, the defense agent must select a set of offers
that most effectively mitigates the DDoS attack. However, there are
a number of factors that the defense agent must consider before
selecting an offer. Specifically, the defense agent must consider the
efficacy of the offer (i.e., the amount of attack traffic or number
of attack sources filtered), the collateral damage incurred by the
offer (i.e., the amount of legitimate traffic or number of legitimate
sources filtered), and the price of the offer.
The defense agent has the freedom to decide which factors to
treat as objectives and which to treat as constraints. In this paper,
we focus on maximizing the defense efficacy, while keeping the
maximum total collateral damage and the maximum amount of
money spent on defense as constraints. Thus, we formulate the
rule selection problem as Equation 1. Table 1 summarizes all of the
notations we use.
Some issues are outside the scope of this paper. In particular, this
paper is not concerned with how rules are generated and simply
assumes the rules generated for traffic filtering are the input to
the rule selection problem. It is not concerned with how rules may
be deployed at filtering networks either, except that it determines
which filtering networks should deploy different rules as the output
of the solution to this problem.

4.2.1 Optimization Objective. First, we formulate the objective
function of the rule selection problem. Let K be the set of all attack
flows, where k represents an attack flow in K, and let ak be the
amount of traffic of attack flow k. Let Jk be the set of filtering
networks that attack flow k passes through, where j represents
a filtering network, and let Ij be the set of all offers provided by
filtering network j, where i represents a single offer. Also, let bi jk
denote a binary value that represents whether offer i from filtering
network j filters attack flow k. Last but not least, the binary variable
xi j denotes whether to select offer i from filtering network j for
deployment. Note, if there exists an offer i from filtering network j
that can filter attack flow k and it has been selected, then xi jbi jk = 1,
otherwise 0. Note then, if there exists at least one offer i from all
of the filtering networks in Jk that can filter attack flow k and it
has been selected, then maxj ∈ Jk ,i ∈Ij {xi jbi jk } = 1, otherwise 0. We
take the max of xi jbi jk over j ∈ Jk and i ∈ Ij because we should not
credit multiple offers for filtering the same attack flow k. Therefore,
to maximize the total amount of attack traffic filtered, the objective
function is written as maxk ∈K ak maxj ∈ Jk ,i ∈Ij {xi jbi jk }.
4.2.2 Optimization Constraints. Next, we formulate the constraints
of the rule selection problem. The first constraint ensures that
the total amount of collateral damage is within tolerance. Let U
be the set of all legitimate flows, where u represents a legitimate
flow in U , and let au be the amount of traffic of legitimate flow u.
Analogously, let bi ju be a binary value that represents whether offer
i from filtering network j filters legitimate flow u, and let Wc be
the threshold for the total amount of collateral damage the defense
agent is able to tolerate. We again do not blame multiple offers
for filtering the same legitimate flow u. Therefore, we have the
Wc . The second constraint ensures that the total cost of the selected
offers respects the total budget. Let Pi j represent the price of offer
i from AS j and Wb represent the defense agent’s budget. Then, we
collateral damage constraint asu ∈U au maxj ∈ Ju ,i ∈Ij {xi jbi ju } ≤
havej ∈ Ji ∈Ij Pi j xi j ≤ Wb . Without loss of generality, the third
constraint,i ∈Ij xi j ≤ 1, ∀j ∈ J , limits the number of offers that
can be selected per AS to one. Finally, the fourth constraint ensures
the atomicity of an offer (i.e., the defense agent can either select
or refuse to select an offer, and cannot split an offer), which we
express as xi j ∈ {0, 1}, ∀j ∈ J , ∀i ∈ I .
