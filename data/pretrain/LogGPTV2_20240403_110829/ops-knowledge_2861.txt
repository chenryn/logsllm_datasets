User: I've tried this and run in to problems a bunch of times in the past. Does anyone have a  recipe for installing lxml on OS X without MacPorts or Fink that definitely works?
Preferably with complete 1-2-3 steps for downloading and building each of the dependencies.
Assistant: I compile it in /usr/local without any issues whatsoever.
Install Python, libxml2, libxslt and then lxml. You might need setuptools installed too.
