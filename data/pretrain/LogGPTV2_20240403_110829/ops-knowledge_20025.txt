Assistant: The Nginx+Keepalived load balancing solution is a load balancing solution suitable for enterprise-level applications, which can achieve efficient and stable system operation. It uses Nginx as the load balancing software, and realizes the distribution and management of business traffic by forming multiple nodes into a load balancing cluster. The specific implementation process is as follows: 1. Install Nginx and Keepalived software, configure a master node and multiple backup nodes. 2. In the Nginx configuration file, define load balancing policies, business traffic distribution rules, monitoring modules, etc. 3. In the Keepalived configuration file, define the monitoring, switching rules and health check mechanisms between the primary and backup nodes. 4. Start the Nginx and Keepalived services, ensure their stable operation, and perform monitoring and logging. Through the above steps, you can complete the construction of an efficient and stable load balancing solution. This solution has the following advantages: 1. It realizes the high availability of multiple nodes and ensures the stability of the system and the continuity of the business. 2. Optimize the distribution and management of business traffic, improve system performance and user experience. 3. It realizes real-time monitoring and log recording, which is convenient for maintenance personnel to diagnose and repair the system. In short, the Nginx+Keepalived load balancing solution is an efficient and stable load balancing solution suitable for enterprise-level applications. It can help enterprises achieve high-quality business operations and better user experience, while effectively reducing system risks and maintenance costs.
