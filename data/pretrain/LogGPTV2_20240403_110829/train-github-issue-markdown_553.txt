Challenge Waypoint: Assignment with Minus Equals has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    var a = 11;
    var b = 9;
    var c = 3;
    // Only modify code below this line
    a -= 6;
    b -= 15;
    c -= 1;
The code and test is okay, but where the result of the test is shown, c is
shown to have a value of '2' instead of just 2, making the result seem like
it's a string when it's most definitely a number.
