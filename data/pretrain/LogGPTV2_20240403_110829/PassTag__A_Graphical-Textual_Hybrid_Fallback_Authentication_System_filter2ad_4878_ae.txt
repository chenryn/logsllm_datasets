In sum, security questions are faster than the graphical hy-
brid schemes, and although the increased authentication time of
PassTag may not be desirable for frequent use cases (e.g., day-to-day
access), it can be justifiable (under 1 min.) for infrequent use cases
such as for fallback authentication given the memorability and secu-
rity improvements of PassTag. Unlike security questions, PassTag is
more memorable without much practice or reinforcement.
12 DISCUSSION
12.1 Advantages of PassTag
Our security and memorability analysis results demonstrate that
participants who used PassTag can create user secrets that are not
only secure against close adversaries but also memorable to them
over a long time period (e.g., three months) compared with those
who used security questions. We believe that combining graphical
and textual passwords would be helpful to enhance both security
and memorability. The advantages of PassTag can be summarized
as follows.
PassTag is Memorable: The overall successful recall rate of
images (97.1%) and input of images-tags (94.7%) after one week
in the second user study indicate that PassTag is memorable. The
high memorability is significant as the decoy images generated by
PassTag were similar to the user-provided images. This shows that
most users have an ability to successfully distinguish their chosen
specific images from a cluster of similar images due to the picture
superiority effect [1]. The memorability of image-tags was also high
indicating that it could be easier for users to recall text after pre-
sented with images as cues to the corresponding image-tags due to
the levels-of-processing effect [6]. Additionally, we found that users
who used PassTag maintained high long-term memorability (95.0%
after three months) of both their graphical and textual passwords
with minimal reinforcement and infrequent authentication com-
pared to the widely used security questions. We hypothesize that
both graphical and textual passwords act as cues of one another to
help during recall.
Users can Create Secure PassTag Secrets: For PassTag to be
secure, the correlation between: (1) two user-provided images; (2)
user-provided image label and text password; and (3) two text pass-
words; needs to be small. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that
users chose non-similar images and inputted non-obvious text pass-
words with the images. The diversity and combination of image
and text passwords can be helpful to enhance the security of the
fallback authentication system. Additionally, although the system
was tasked to find 20 similar images for each user-provided image,
the correlation between user-provided image and system generated
image needs to be high and PassTag was able to generate similar
images to the user-provided images.
Our approach showed promising results in terms of security
as the guessing attacks from close adversaries performed poorly
according to our study results. This was mainly because the decoy
images used in PassTag would be effective in increasing the diffi-
culty of guessing the correct image secret. We found that strangers
failed to guess the image secrets at most times through user studies.
Even close adversaries who have correctly guessed the image secret
finally failed to provide the additional corresponding correct textual
password. In comparison to the analysis by Rabkin [33] where 12%
of the security question samples could be attacked through user
studies, our close adversaries had 0% success rate attacking PassTag.
Those results show that the superiority of PassTag over security
questions in terms of security.
PassTag is Usable: Examining the results of the user studies,
PassTag is both secure and memorable. However, this advantage
comes at the cost of usability as our user-study results show that it
took longer for users to create (average 51.7 seconds) and authenti-
cate passwords (average 52.3 secs). The requirement for users to
examine and discern passwords from 40 images could be the con-
tributing factor to the extended creation and authentication time.
Yet, given the high memorability and infrequent use for fallback
authentication systems, we believe we can justify the longer authen-
tication time. One possibility to reduce creation and authentication
time is to reduce the total number of images that are displayed by
PassTag. This could increase usability but at the cost of security. For
future work, we plan to find the optimal amount of decoy images
to generate, while also preserving high security PassTag provides.

The key limitations of our work are the following: (1) we did not
have users create multiple accounts with PassTag; and, (2) our sam-
ple size was small, and the majority of the participants were quite
mostly young memory-strong population. Additionally, the eco-
logical validity is a limitation in our study design: We evaluated
PassTag in a controlled lab setting only, and participants may not
want to use the secrets selected in the studies for real-world appli-
cations. Moreover, even though we were able to test the recall rate
up three months, it would be interesting to evaluate the long term
memorability of PassTag after three months.
Our concern about the current PassTag design is that users
should provide secure and memorable images and texts. However,
similar to conventional textual passwords, it is sometimes chal-
lenging for casual users to choose secure and usable secrets as
their password. For example, Ur et al. [41] demonstrated that users
often have the wrong perception of what constitutes a secure pass-
word. Therefore, one future direction to strengthen the security
of PassTag is to explore the possibility of system-assigned image-
tags instead of user-provided image-tags. Perhaps, system-assisted
password selection policies (e.g., [5]) can be considered to avoid
the selection of weak passwords. Also, state-of-the-art machine
learning technology might help generate secure and memorable
image-tags automatically. Inherently, PassTag requires more net-
work bandwidth than text-based question-answer systems because
PassTag needs to transmit decoy images additionally. Therefore, we
need to measure the network bandwidth required for PassTag in
real-world settings. These are all limitations that will need to be
addressed before PassTag can be adopted into real-world use cases.
13 CONCLUSION
We proposed PassTag, a fallback authentication system, which
takes advantage of graphical and textual authentication methods.
PassTag strikes a good balance between memorability and security.
Our user study results demonstrate that PassTag improved the
success rate of authentication compared with conventional fallback
authentication schemes such as security questions. While it may
take more time for users to register and log-in using PassTag, we
believe the benefits of PassTag outweigh the cost. In future work,
we plan to conduct large scale user studies to evaluate PassTag for
longer periods of disuse. Furthermore, we plan to implement a
different number of images presented and selected by users in
the authentication phase to find the optimal number of iterations
that will reduce authentication time while keeping it secure. In
sum, PassTag can be a promising option for fallback authentication
systems. Therefore, we need to focus on further understanding the
images/tags users provide and the policies, guidance, and feedback
that can help them choose more secure and memorable images and
tags for PassTag.
