### Summary
Security questions are generally faster than graphical hybrid schemes. However, the increased authentication time of PassTag, while not ideal for frequent use cases (e.g., daily access), is justifiable for infrequent use cases such as fallback authentication. This is due to the enhanced memorability and security provided by PassTag. Unlike security questions, PassTag remains memorable with minimal practice or reinforcement.

### 12. Discussion

#### 12.1 Advantages of PassTag
Our analysis of security and memorability indicates that participants using PassTag can create user secrets that are both secure against close adversaries and memorable over a long period (e.g., three months) compared to those using security questions. Combining graphical and textual passwords enhances both security and memorability. The key advantages of PassTag are summarized below:

- **Memorability**: 
  - The high recall rates for images (97.1%) and image-tags (94.7%) after one week in the second user study indicate that PassTag is highly memorable.
  - The ability of users to distinguish their chosen images from similar decoy images demonstrates the picture superiority effect [1].
  - High long-term memorability (95.0% after three months) was maintained with minimal reinforcement and infrequent authentication, suggesting that both graphical and textual elements act as mutual cues during recall.

- **Security**:
  - PassTag requires a low correlation between two user-provided images, the user-provided image label and text password, and two text passwords.
  - Users chose non-similar images and inputted non-obvious text passwords, enhancing the security of the fallback authentication system.
  - Decoy images generated by PassTag were effective in increasing the difficulty of guessing the correct image secret, as evidenced by the poor performance of close adversaries in our study.
  - Strangers and even close adversaries who correctly guessed the image secret often failed to provide the corresponding textual password, highlighting PassTag's superior security compared to security questions.

- **Usability**:
  - While PassTag is both secure and memorable, it comes at the cost of usability. User studies show that it takes longer to create (average 51.7 seconds) and authenticate (average 52.3 seconds) passwords.
  - The requirement to examine and discern passwords from 40 images contributes to the extended creation and authentication time.
  - For infrequent use cases, the longer authentication time is justifiable given the high memorability and security benefits. Future work will focus on optimizing the number of displayed images to enhance usability without compromising security.

### 12.2 Limitations and Future Work
The key limitations of our work include:
- **Limited Scope**: We did not have users create multiple accounts with PassTag, and our sample size was small, primarily consisting of young, memory-strong participants.
- **Ecological Validity**: The study was conducted in a controlled lab setting, which may not reflect real-world usage. Additionally, the long-term memorability of PassTag beyond three months needs further evaluation.
- **User Selection of Secrets**: Similar to conventional textual passwords, casual users may find it challenging to choose secure and usable images and texts. Future work will explore the possibility of system-assigned image-tags and consider system-assisted password selection policies to avoid weak passwords.
- **Network Bandwidth**: PassTag requires more network bandwidth than text-based question-answer systems due to the transmission of decoy images. Real-world network requirements need to be measured and optimized.

### 13. Conclusion
We proposed PassTag, a fallback authentication system that leverages both graphical and textual authentication methods. PassTag achieves a good balance between memorability and security. Our user study results demonstrate that PassTag improves the success rate of authentication compared to conventional fallback schemes like security questions. Although it may take more time for users to register and log in, the benefits of PassTag outweigh the costs. Future work will involve large-scale user studies, evaluating PassTag over longer periods of disuse, and optimizing the number of images presented during authentication to reduce time while maintaining security. In summary, PassTag is a promising option for fallback authentication systems, and further research will focus on understanding user behavior and improving the selection of secure and memorable images and tags.
