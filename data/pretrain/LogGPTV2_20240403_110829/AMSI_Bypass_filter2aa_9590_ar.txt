### Overview of AMSI and Bypass Methods

**AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface)** is a script-based malware detection mechanism that is enabled by default in Windows 10. For more detailed information, refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn889587(v=vs.85).aspx).

This script implements six methods for bypassing AMSI:

1. **unload**: A method developed by Matt Graeber that unloads AMSI from the current PowerShell session.
2. **unload2**: Another method by Matt Graeber, which also unloads AMSI from the current PowerShell session.
3. **unloadsilent**: A method by Matt Graeber that unloads AMSI and avoids Windows Management Framework 5 (WMF5) auto-logging.
4. **unloadobfuscated**: The `unload` method obfuscated using Daniel Bohannon's `Invoke-Obfuscation` tool, which also avoids WMF5 auto-logging.
5. **dllhijack**: A method by Cornelis de Plaa that uses a modified `amsi.dll` file, sourced from p0wnedshell's GitHub repository ([p0wnedShell](https://github.com/Cn33liz/p0wnedShell)).
6. **psv2**: If .NET Framework 2.0.50727 is available on Windows 10, this method launches PowerShell v2, which does not support AMSI.

### Tools for Obfuscation

The script also provides information on tools that can be used for obfuscation:

- **ISE-Steroids**: A PowerShell ISE add-on that includes various features for script development and obfuscation. More details can be found at [PowerTheShell](http://www.powertheshell.com/isesteroidsmanual/download/).
- **Invoke-Obfuscation**: A PowerShell obfuscation framework developed by Daniel Bohannon. Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation).

### Script Parameters

- **-Method <string>**: Specifies the method to be used for bypassing AMSI. The default method is `unloadsilent`.
- **-ShowOnly <switch>**: When this parameter is used, the bypass method is only displayed to the user and not executed.

### Examples

1. **Running the `unloadsilent` Method:**
   ```powershell
   PS > Invoke-AmsiBypass -Verbose
   ```
   This command runs the `unloadsilent` method.

2. **Running the `unloadobfuscated` Method:**
   ```powershell
   PS > Invoke-PsUACme -Method unloadobfuscated -Verbose
   ```
   This command runs the `unloadobfuscated` method.
