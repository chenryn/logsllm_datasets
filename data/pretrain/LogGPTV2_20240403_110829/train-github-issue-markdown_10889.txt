With RESTART_ON_UPGRADE disabled (default for at least 1.5.2), the init script
of ES 1.7.x will be unable to restart ES after a Debian package upgrade from
1.5.x or earlier.
This is because the pid file path changed in 1.6.0 (IIRC), so when a user
invokes e.g. `/etc/init.d/elasticsearch restart` after the package has been
upgraded no pid file is found and ES is deemed to not be running. The
subsequent start will then fail since it can't bind to any ports as they're
still busy by the running ES process.
This broke my automated upgrade from 1.5.2 to 1.7.1, requiring a manual
shutdown of ES on affected machines and/or a package rollback. Could we try a
little harder to find the pid file by e.g. introducing a fallback pid file in
the 1.7.x series? Perhaps migrating the old pid file with something as simple
as
    LEGACY_PID_FILE="/var/run/elasticsearch.pid"
    if [ -f "$LEGACY_PID_FILE" -a "$LEGACY_PID_FILE" != "$PID_FILE" ] ; then 
            mv "$LEGACY_PID_FILE" "$PID_FILE" || exit 1
    fi
right after the PID_DIR creation in /etc/init.d/elasticsearch would do?
