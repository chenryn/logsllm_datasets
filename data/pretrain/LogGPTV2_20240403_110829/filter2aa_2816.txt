What we are doing here?
• Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design
• It’s easy!
• It’s fun!
• It will let everyone you know how 
much of a nerd you really are!
But what is a PCB?
• Layers of dielectric and metal
• Usually copper and FR4
• Anywhere from 2 to 20
• A means to layout circuits
• Prototype vs. Production
What to do with Cu?
• Create electrical 
connections between 
components
• Traces/Tracks
• Pours/Planes
• Need to use vias to 
connect layers
What’s a via?
• Plated hole going through the board 
that connects the layers together
• Yes, all of the layers (be careful!)
• Well, not always...
• Blind Vias
• Buried Vias
Components
• A circuit without components is like...
• A bird without wings
• A car without wheels
• A grad student without funding
Components
• A collection of pads or vias that a chip 
or discrete part will connect to the 
board
• a.k.a. Footprint
Datasheets:  Who cares?
• We do!
• Shows lots of valuable information:
• Electrical speciﬁcations
• Usual applications/schematics
• Footprint sizes 
What happens when you 
don’t listen to the datasheet:
Design Rules
• If you design it, they still might not be 
able to fab it.
• Machines are only so precise
• Smaller == $$$
• Allow for tolerances
• Design Rule Check (DRC) is a must!!!!
The Finishing Touches
•Soldermask
•Plating metal
•Silkscreen
Secrets of the Pros
• When in doubt, make the pad/via/
through-hole bigger than you think it 
should be
• Through Hole ROT:  +0.010” to 
diameter
• Will allow more room to solder or 
allow for an better ﬁt
• Use 1:1 printouts to make sure 
components ﬁt properly
More Secrets
• The Capacitor - An 
EE’s Duct Tape
• Reduces noise!
• Stores extra 
charge!
• Slices a transfer 
function!
• And even more!!!!

• Hundreds more
• Try Googling it
Enough Talk!
• Let’s design a PCB!
• We are going to use Advanced Circuits’ 
PCB Artist
• How about we redesign the DEFCON17 
Badge?
• All materials and information is
