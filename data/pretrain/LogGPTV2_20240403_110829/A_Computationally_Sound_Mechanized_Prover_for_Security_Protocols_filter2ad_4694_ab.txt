### Channel Restriction and Process Calculus Syntax

#### Syntax of the Process Calculus
The syntax of the process calculus is defined as follows:

- **Channel Restriction:**
  \[
  P ::= \text{input} \mid \text{output process} \mid c[M_1, \ldots, M_l](x_1, \ldots, x_k); Q \mid \text{new } x[i_1, \ldots, i_m] : T; P \mid \text{let } x[i_1, \ldots, i_m] : T = M \text{ in } P \mid \text{if } M \text{ then } P \text{ else } P' \mid \text{find } (\bigwedge_{j=1}^m u_j \leq n_j) \land M_j \text{ then } P_j \text{ else } P
  \]

- **Output Process:**
  \[
  \text{new } x[i_1, \ldots, i_m] : T; P
  \]
  This process chooses a new random number uniformly from \( I_\eta(T) \), stores it in \( x[i_1, \ldots, i_m] \), and executes \( P \).

- **Assignment:**
  \[
  \text{let } x[i_1, \ldots, i_m] : T = M \text{ in } P
  \]
  This process stores the bitstring value of \( M \) (which must be in \( I_\eta(T) \)) in \( x[i_1, \ld ., i_m] \), and executes \( P \).

- **Conditional:**
  \[
  \text{if } M \text{ then } P \text{ else } P'
  \]
  This process executes \( P \) if \( M \) evaluates to 1, and \( P' \) if \( M \) evaluates to 0.

- **Find Construct:**
  \[
  \text{find } (\bigwedge_{j=1}^m u_j \leq n_j) \land M_j \text{ then } P_j \text{ else } P
  \]
  This process tries to find values of \( u_1, \ldots, u_m \) for which \( M_j \) is true. If successful, it executes \( P_j \). Otherwise, it executes \( P \).

- **Array Lookup:**
  \[
  x[M_1, \ldots, M_m]
  \]
  This returns the content of the cell of indexes \( M_1, \ldots, M_m \) of the array variable \( x \).

- **Random Number Generation:**
  \[
  \text{new } x[i_1, \ldots, i_m] : T
  \]
  This generates a new random number uniformly in \( I_\eta(T) \).

#### Parameters and Types
- **Parameters:**
  The calculus assumes a set of parameters denoted by \( n \), which correspond to integer values polynomial in the security parameter \( \eta \). Specifically, \( I_\eta(n) = q(\eta) \) where \( q \) is a polynomial, and \( I_\eta(n) \) denotes the interpretation of \( n \) for a given value of \( \eta \).

- **Types:**
  The calculus also assumes a set of types denoted by \( T \). For each value of \( \eta \), each type corresponds to a subset \( I_\eta(T) \) of \( \text{Bitstring} \cup \{\bot\} \), where \( \text{Bitstring} \) is the set of all bitstrings and \( \bot \) is a special symbol. The set \( I_\eta(T) \) must be recognizable in polynomial time.

  - **Fixed-Length Types:**
    These are types \( T \) such that \( I_\eta(T) \) is the set of all bitstrings of a certain length, this length being a function of \( \eta \) bounded by a polynomial.
  
  - **Large Types:**
    These are types \( T \) such that \( |I_\eta(T)| \) is negligible. A function \( f(\eta) \) is negligible if for all polynomials \( q \), there exists \( \eta_0 \in \mathbb{N} \) such that for all \( \eta > \eta_0 \), \( f(\eta) \leq \frac{1}{q(\eta)} \).

- **Predefined Types:**
  - `bool`: \( I_\eta(\text{bool}) = \{0, 1\} \), where 0 means false and 1 means true.
  - `bitstring`: \( I_\eta(\text{bitstring}) = \text{Bitstring} \).
  - `bitstring ‚ä•`: \( I_\eta(\text{bitstring} \perp) = \text{Bitstring} \cup \{\bot\} \).
  - `[1, n]`: \( I_\eta([1, n]) = [1, I_\eta(n)] \).

#### Function Symbols
- **Function Symbols:**
  The calculus assumes a finite set of function symbols \( f \). Each function symbol comes with a type declaration \( f : T_1 \times \ldots \times T_m \to T \). For each value of \( \eta \), each function symbol \( f \) corresponds to a function \( I_\eta(f) \) from \( I_\eta(T_1) \times \ldots \times I_\eta(T_m) \) to \( I_\eta(T) \), such that \( I_\eta(f)(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \) is computable in polynomial time in the lengths of \( x_1, \ldots, x_m \) and the value of \( \eta \).

- **Predefined Functions:**
  - Equality test: \( M = N \)
  - Inequality test: \( M \neq N \)
  - Boolean OR: \( M \lor N \)
  - Boolean AND: \( M \land N \)
  - Boolean negation: \( \neg M \)

#### Processes
- **Input and Output Processes:**
  - **Input Process:** \( Q \) is ready to receive a message on a channel.
  - **Output Process:** \( P \) outputs a message on a channel after executing some internal computations.

- **Replication:**
  \[
  !i \leq n Q
  \]
  This represents \( n \) copies of \( Q \) in parallel, each with a different value of \( i \in [1, n] \).

- **New Channel:**
  \[
  \text{newChannel } c; Q
  \]
  This creates a new private channel \( c \) and executes \( Q \).

- **Input and Output Semantics:**
  - **Input:**
    \[
    c[M_1, \ldots, M_l](x_1, \ldots, x_k); P
    \]
    This input process waits to receive a message on channel \( c \) with terms \( M_1, \ldots, M_l \) and stores the received values in \( x_1, \ldots, x_k \), then executes \( P \).

  - **Output:**
    \[
    c[M_1, \ldots, M_l](N_1, \ldots, N_k); Q
    \]
    This output process sends messages \( N_1, \ldots, N_k \) on channel \( c \) with terms \( M_1, \ldots, M_l \), then executes \( Q \).

- **Adversary Control:**
  Using different channels for each input and output allows the adversary to control the network. For example, writing:
  \[
  !i \leq n c[i](x[i] : T) \ldots c'[i](M) \ldots
  \]
  The adversary can decide which copy of the replicated process receives its message by sending it on \( c[i] \) for the appropriate value of \( i \).

- **Syntactic Abbreviations:**
  - `if M then P` is an abbreviation for `if M then P else yield(); 0`.
  - A trailing `0` after an output may be omitted.

- **Variable Definitions:**
  Variables can be defined by assignments, inputs, restrictions, and array lookups. The current replication indexes at a certain program point in a process are \( i_1, \ldots, i_m \) where the replications above the considered program point are \( !i_1 \leq n_1 \ldots !i_m \leq n_m \).

- **Invariants:**
  - **Invariant 1 (Single Definition):** Ensures that each variable is assigned at most once for each value of its indexes.
  - **Invariant 2 (Defined Variables):** Ensures that variables can be accessed only when they have been initialized.

- **Poly-Injective Functions:**
  A function \( f : T_1 \times \ldots \times T_m \to T \) is poly-injective if it is injective and its inverses can be computed in polynomial time. We define a pattern matching construct:
  \[
  \text{let } f(x_1, \ldots, x_m) = M \text{ in } P \text{ else } Q
  \]
  as an abbreviation for:
  \[
  \text{let } y : T = M \text{ in let } x_1 : T_1 = f^{-1}_1(y) \text{ in } \ldots \text{ in } P \text{ else } Q
  \]
