# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

The Terminal application does not currently integrate well with PowerToys, specifically with the FancyZones feature. When attempting to use the "Shift + Move Window" shortcut, the Terminal window does not activate or snap to the predefined zones in FancyZones.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

To address this issue, we propose implementing the following enhancement:

- **Enable Shift + Move Window for Terminal**: When the user holds down the `Shift` key and clicks on the title bar of the Terminal window, the window should be able to be moved and snapped into the predefined zones in PowerToys FancyZones. This would provide a consistent and seamless experience across all applications that support FancyZones.

This implementation will ensure that the Terminal application behaves consistently with other windows when using the FancyZones feature, enhancing the overall usability and user experience.
