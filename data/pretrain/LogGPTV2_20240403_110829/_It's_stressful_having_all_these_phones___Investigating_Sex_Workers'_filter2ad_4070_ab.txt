safety, asking questions such as “What is safety to you as a
sex worker? How do you deﬁne safety?” We then probed their
perceived risks (e.g., whether they have had a negative expe-
rience online, what types of attacks and attackers they aim to
protect themselves against). We then explored participants’
strategies for maintaining their online safety (e.g., “Would
you say you do anything in particular to maintain your safety
online?”), including probing speciﬁc behaviors such as use
of security and privacy settings. Lastly, we asked participants
questions about additional sex-work-related topics, outside
the scope of this research paper.
Interview procedure. Participants chose to be interviewed
either via chat, voice, or video. As such, there are quotes that

language preference, interviews were conducted in English or
German by members of the research team ﬂuent in that lan-
guage. Interviews lasted on average 60 minutes, ranging from
approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours. For participant safety,
all interviews were conducted using private paid “rooms” on
Appear.in,1 an end-to-end encrypted communication service.
Participants were paid the equivalent of $75USD (75CHF
or 60 Euros) in the form of an Amazon gift card or money
transfer.2 Following each interview session, audio recordings
of the interviews, if applicable, were transcribed in the native
language. German transcripts (both chat and audio) were then
translated into English for analysis; bilingual members of the
research team consulted the original German transcripts dur-
ing analysis to ensure that tone, turns of phrase, and cultural
contexts were captured and included in quotes and coding.
3.3 Survey Data Collection
After conducting interviews, we developed a survey instru-
ment to gain a larger sample size and quantiﬁcation of the
same topics and emergent themes explored in our interviews.
Speciﬁcally, we used an open-response question to probe re-
spondents’ deﬁnitions of safety: “How do you deﬁne safety
as a sex worker? What does it mean for you to be safe?” Four
closed-response questions asked about respondents’ use of
different digital tools (e.g., encrypted messaging applications,
Tor); their use of safety strategies mentioned by interview
participants (e.g., “I only communicate with clients on certain
devices, SIM cards, or apps”); and how legalization of sex
work and immigration status affected respondents’ feelings of
safety.3 Survey participants were recruited from sex workers
who contacted us to participate in the interview after inter-
views had concluded (early 2019), and were compensated
10EUR for roughly a 10-minute survey. As in our interview
study, respondents could take the survey in either German or
English.
3.4 Analysis
Interviews were analyzed using an open-coding process.
Three co-authors randomly selected four interview transcripts
to identify emerging themes and create a thematic framework
for the interview data. After creating a codebook, two of the
co-authors independently coded 10 interviews to reach clearer
insights into the interview data. All interview transcripts were
then double-coded, codings were reviewed by the researchers
after every two to three interviews, and any disagreements
were reconciled. Because the interviewers reviewed every

independently-coded transcript together, we do not present
inter-rater reliability [49, 53].
Responses to the open-response survey question about
safety deﬁnitions were similarly analyzed using the same
codebook. The results of our closed-response survey ques-
tions are reported descriptively. As this work is exploratory
in nature, we had no hypotheses and thus make no statistical
comparisons.
3.5 Limitations
Our results may be limited in their generalizability and by
participants’ willingness to share sensitive experiences. While
we did our best to use many recruitment methods, conduct
our study in multiple languages and at different sites, use non-
judgmental language, and offer participants a high degree of
privacy to encourage sharing, we cannot be sure that we ex-
haustively captured all possible experiences and strategies of
sex workers in countries where sex work is legal. However,
our results provide a set of concrete insights into the expe-
riences and safety strategies of a high-risk population, not
previously studied in the security literature.
4 Results
Based on the responses from both interview and survey par-
ticipants,4 we describe the privacy and security goals of our
participants, the threats they see to those goals, and the strate-
gies they use to protect themselves.
4.1 Deﬁnitions of Safety
We identify seven common safety goals. Most participants
mentioned physical safety, and many talked about ﬁnancial
security, clear boundaries, and privacy. For some respect, le-
gality, and access to community were important safety aspects.
The ways that our participants deﬁne safety are intimately
connected with their digital security needs and guide their
protective strategies. By considering our participants’ holistic
safety goals [61], we can better understand their decision-
making processes and unmet safety and security needs. While
we describe each safety goal separately, these goals are inter-
connected and were often discussed together by participants.
For example, both ﬁnancial security and privacy may be nec-
essary to minimize the risk of physical harm.
Physical safety. Most participants’ deﬁnitions of safety in-
cluded physical safety, which often encompassed being pro-
tected from physical assault or threat of assault by aggressive
clients. As one survey participant stated, safety means “be-
ing able to work without fear of abuse or aggression” (S36).

That said, not all participants feared for their physical safety.
Although we cannot report safety fears by gender due to par-
ticipant protections, one participant’s response suggested that
their race and gender impacted their sense of safety: “Since I
am a very privileged white cis male I don’t think about safety
so much.” (S12) This difference in safety concerns across race
and gender is consistent with other studies [54].
Many participants discussed physical safety as being re-
lated to having the necessary resources — including supplies,
a safe physical space in which to work, and access to health-
care and the ability to enforce safe sex practices such as the
use of condoms — to safely do their work. P11 describes:
“Safety for me means: I can do my job in an en-
vironment that doesn’t endanger me and provides
me with the necessary stuff to protect me. I need
gloves and condoms, for example. I also like to not
be raped and killed on the job, so I prefer working
in a studio with colleagues present.” (P11)
“Safety is knowing. . . that my boundaries won’t get
crossed, like pushed to have unprotected sex. That
I’ll get paid for what I asked and that the hours will
be clear and done.” (P8)
Respect. Many participants connected their safety and well-
being to being respected by clients and society at large. S10
stated that safety means “not feeling that society thinks it’s
normal for me to get hurt.” P20 expands on this idea, saying
that safety is intertwined with being protected from discrimi-
nation and stigma:
“The absence of fear of suffering personal or ﬁnan-
cial disadvantages due to one’s activity. . . where
the rule of law prevails over personal reservations.
Working as a [sex worker] should be recognized as
a normal job.” (P20)
Privacy. Respect and privacy are often linked. P6 says:
Some participants described safety as when their protective
strategies — including digital strategies — were in place (we
discuss protective strategies in more detail in Section 4.3).
For example, one participant shared:
“Privacy is directly tied in with safety from harass-
ment these days. Safety is about working safe in a
society that treats me with respect and respects my
privacy as well.” (P6)
“I’m safe when people know where I am. . . I like
when the clients send me photos before of them
because when I don’t know the face of the guy I am
very scared.” (P10)
Financial security. For many participants, ﬁnancial secu-
rity is a primary component of safety. Participants mentioned
that ﬁnancial security depends on sex workers being compen-
sated fairly and having access to health insurance and other
government and social safety nets. Financial security also ties
closely into physical safety. For example, several participants
mentioned that when they are ﬁnancially secure, they are able
to turn away clients who make them feel unsafe. For example,
S31 explains:
“I don’t use drugs, don’t gamble, have no debts, no
ﬁnancially needy relatives etc so I feel zero pressure
to accept bookings. . . if I had to accept jobs against
my better judgement eg someone who’s obviously
drunk or aggressive... or demanding services I don’t
offer, I would be unsafe.” (S31)
Clear boundaries. Many participants’ deﬁnitions of safety
involved ideas of boundaries, psychological well-being, and,
as S9 put it, “to have control.” Participants reported feel-
ing safe when their physical and sexual boundaries were re-
spected, but also when their personal time was respected, as
well as when digital boundaries they established between their
work and personal lives were honored. P8 describes:
For others, feeling safe is directly connected to their abil-
ity to control the privacy of their personal information from
clients and/or from their social networks.
“For me, privacy is when clients don’t know my
name or address and can only contact me when I
allow it. . . . An unannounced visit from a friend
would be something nice. An unannounced visit
from a client would be a catastrophe.” (P14)
Many participants worried about being “outed,” or publicly
identiﬁed as a sex worker against their wishes. The potential
consequences of being outed range from embarrassment to
blackmail and threats of physical violence. P10 shared:
“I have a friend who [was blackmailed]. And if
she didn’t pay [the blackmailer], [they] would tell
all the . . . neighborhood . . . My friend was born in
a Muslim family, so it’s more difﬁcult. . . . If her
family knows it, and if neighborhood knows it, she
said to me that it would be the end of social life for
her family.” (P10)
This demonstrates how closely related privacy and physical
safety are: if privacy goals are not met, it may lead directly to
physical danger.
Legality. For some participants, safety stems from working
legally and having access to support services:
“I want to be recognized as a legit business. I want
to tax my income and also deduct my expenses. I
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    379
want to qualify for social security. I also want a
safe way to advertise and ﬁnd clients. I want to be
protected by law, if a client misbehaves.” (P6)
S22 describes how working in environments where clients
feared law enforcement — because the location where they
were pursuing services was not in compliance with legal
regulation — makes their job less safe:
“[I want] to work as little as possible in ‘gray / dark’
environments, such that customers [don’t] have the
feeling of needing to hide - [then] it is easier for me
to vet them ahead of time.” (S22)
For some participants, like P6, safety meant being able to
call the police if they had a negative experience or were in
danger. However, among our participants the ability to call the
police safely might depend on whether they were ofﬁcially
registered as a sex worker, which was often, in turn, related to
their immigration and work authorization status. Thus, some
participants instead described safety as minimizing contact
with the police as much as possible. S2 explains:
“One of my sex worker friends is an undocumented
migrant. . . She has no right to access healthcare.
She is very distrustful of police and the authorities.
She guards her privacy and anonymity more than
other sex workers I know.” (S2)
Access to community. Having access to a support commu-
nity of other sex workers can also be an important component
of safety. These support communities may be online or ofﬂine,
as suggested by other work on sex workers [22, 64]. These
online spaces can provide emotional or logistical support in
the case of a negative experience, or just a place to feel val-
idated and less isolated. S52 identiﬁes that to feel safe, it is
important for them to “ensure I get things off my chest. . . with
other sex workers in-house or online when I can.”
While these communities can provide safety education and
resources, participants may face signiﬁcant barriers to achiev-
ing and maintaining them. Policies regulating the use of online
platforms for sex-work-related topics, even if not used for sex
work itself, threaten the existence of these communities.
4.2 Perceptions of Risk
We next discuss the sources of risk identiﬁed by our partici-
pants. Unsurprisingly, clients pose a signiﬁcant threat. Risks
from clients often manifest on multiple safety axes. For exam-
ple, clients may violate a sex worker’s boundaries by ﬁnding
their personal Facebook. If the sex worker’s legal name is ex-
posed, this can create risks of stalking and blackmail, which
in turn increases risks to their physical security.
However, risk also stems from the legal and technical land-
scape in which sex work is conducted. Laws that regulate
sex work (or business more generally) create opportunities
for unwanted information exposure. Similarly, digital plat-
forms create information exposure risks through the ways
they moderate content and (dis)allow sexually-explicit uses,
which may threaten the ﬁnancial security and physical safety
of participants. Finally, even the non-sexual policies of dig-
ital platforms — like “real name” requirements and people
recommendation algorithms — create privacy risks for sex
workers.
Risks from clients. Clients were often the most direct
threat to workers’ physical safety. Several participants shared
stories of physical assault, while many others discussed expe-
riences with harassment and stalking:
“If you decide to close the [work] relation[ship]
[some clients] become obsessive. A couple of
times. . . I have been blackmailed, threaten they’d
expose my activities online to my peers and family.
Others have just showed up on my place of work
looking for me. . . It’s very unsettling, but with the
right precautions I’ve learnt to avoid it. I’d much
rather lose money than meet someone with potential
to cause problems.” (P17)
Efforts to avoid dangerous clients may threaten a partici-
pant’s ﬁnancial security. Furthermore, the threat of stalking
and blackmail from clients often led participants to not only
focus on physical safety, but also discuss the importance of
privacy. In particular, keeping their real name and location
private from clients was important for staying safe both online
and ofﬂine. As P11 stated, “I don’t want clients to show up
at my university or worse, at my ﬂat. Some clients can get
attached.” P24 had similar concerns, and shared a story illus-
trating the intersection between privacy and physical safety:
“My lovely partner, who is also a photographer,
has photographed me a couple times. I wasn’t very
smart and published my photos with his tag on a
relatively public forum. . . Then, a client of mine
who was very fond of me — which I also wasn’t
totally aware of — did some research and ﬁgured
out who my boyfriend is. He found our places of
