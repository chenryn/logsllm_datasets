### Safety and Perceived Risks

We began by exploring the concept of safety with participants, asking questions such as, "What does safety mean to you as a sex worker? How do you define safety?" We then delved into their perceived risks, including whether they had experienced negative online interactions and what types of threats and attackers they aimed to protect themselves against. Next, we inquired about their strategies for maintaining online safety, such as, "Do you take any specific measures to ensure your safety online?" This included examining specific behaviors like the use of security and privacy settings. Finally, we asked about additional sex-work-related topics that were beyond the scope of this research paper.

### Interview Procedure

Participants could choose to be interviewed via chat, voice, or video. As a result, some quotes may contain text-speak or emojis. Interviews were conducted in English or German, based on the participant's language preference, by members of the research team fluent in the respective language. The interviews lasted an average of 60 minutes, ranging from approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours. To ensure participant safety, all interviews were conducted using private, paid "rooms" on Appear.in (now known as Whereby.com), an end-to-end encrypted communication service. Participants were compensated with the equivalent of $75 USD (75 CHF or 60 Euros) in the form of an Amazon gift card or money transfer. Following each interview, audio recordings, if applicable, were transcribed in the native language. German transcripts (both chat and audio) were then translated into English for analysis. Bilingual members of the research team consulted the original German transcripts during analysis to ensure that tone, turns of phrase, and cultural contexts were accurately captured and included in the coding.

### Survey Data Collection

After conducting the interviews, we developed a survey instrument to gather a larger sample size and quantify the same topics and emergent themes explored in the interviews. Specifically, we used an open-response question to probe respondents' definitions of safety: "How do you define safety as a sex worker? What does it mean for you to be safe?" Four closed-response questions addressed the use of different digital tools (e.g., encrypted messaging applications, Tor), the use of safety strategies mentioned by interview participants (e.g., "I only communicate with clients on certain devices, SIM cards, or apps"), and how the legalization of sex work and immigration status affected respondents' feelings of safety. Survey participants were recruited from sex workers who contacted us after the interviews concluded (early 2019) and were compensated 10 EUR for a roughly 10-minute survey. Respondents could take the survey in either German or English.

### Analysis

Interviews were analyzed using an open-coding process. Three co-authors randomly selected four interview transcripts to identify emerging themes and create a thematic framework for the interview data. After developing a codebook, two co-authors independently coded 10 interviews to gain deeper insights. All interview transcripts were double-coded, and codings were reviewed by the researchers after every two to three interviews to reconcile any disagreements. Because the interviewers reviewed each independently coded transcript together, we do not present inter-rater reliability.

Responses to the open-response survey question about safety definitions were similarly analyzed using the same codebook. The results of the closed-response survey questions are reported descriptively. Given the exploratory nature of this work, we did not have hypotheses and thus made no statistical comparisons.

### Limitations

Our results may be limited in their generalizability and by participants' willingness to share sensitive experiences. Despite our efforts to use multiple recruitment methods, conduct the study in multiple languages, use non-judgmental language, and offer a high degree of privacy, we cannot be certain that we exhaustively captured all possible experiences and strategies of sex workers in countries where sex work is legal. However, our results provide concrete insights into the experiences and safety strategies of a high-risk population, which has not been previously studied in the security literature.

### Results

Based on responses from both interview and survey participants, we describe the privacy and security goals of our participants, the threats they perceive, and the strategies they use to protect themselves.

#### Definitions of Safety

We identified seven common safety goals. Most participants mentioned physical safety, and many discussed financial security, clear boundaries, and privacy. For some, respect, legality, and access to community were also important safety aspects. These definitions of safety are closely tied to participants' digital security needs and guide their protective strategies. By considering these holistic safety goals, we can better understand their decision-making processes and unmet safety and security needs. While we describe each safety goal separately, these goals are interconnected and often discussed together by participants. For example, both financial security and privacy may be necessary to minimize the risk of physical harm.

**Physical Safety:** Most participants defined safety as being protected from physical assault or the threat of assault by aggressive clients. One survey participant stated, "Safety means being able to work without fear of abuse or aggression" (S36). Not all participants feared for their physical safety, and one response suggested that race and gender impacted their sense of safety: "Since I am a very privileged white cis male, I don’t think about safety so much" (S12). Many participants discussed physical safety in terms of having the necessary resources, including supplies, a safe working environment, and access to healthcare and the ability to enforce safe sex practices such as the use of condoms. P11 described, "Safety for me means: I can do my job in an environment that doesn’t endanger me and provides me with the necessary stuff to protect me. I need gloves and condoms, for example. I also like to not be raped and killed on the job, so I prefer working in a studio with colleagues present."

**Respect:** Many participants connected their safety and well-being to being respected by clients and society at large. S10 stated, "Safety means not feeling that society thinks it’s normal for me to get hurt." P20 expanded on this idea, saying that safety is intertwined with being protected from discrimination and stigma: "The absence of fear of suffering personal or financial disadvantages due to one’s activity... where the rule of law prevails over personal reservations. Working as a [sex worker] should be recognized as a normal job."

**Privacy:** Respect and privacy are often linked. P6 said, "Privacy is directly tied in with safety from harassment these days. Safety is about working safe in a society that treats me with respect and respects my privacy as well." Some participants described safety as when their protective strategies, including digital ones, were in place. For example, P10 shared, "I’m safe when people know where I am... I like when the clients send me photos before of them because when I don’t know the face of the guy, I am very scared."

**Financial Security:** For many participants, financial security is a primary component of safety. Participants mentioned that financial security depends on fair compensation, access to health insurance, and other government and social safety nets. Financial security also ties closely into physical safety. Several participants mentioned that when they are financially secure, they can turn away clients who make them feel unsafe. S31 explained, "I don’t use drugs, don’t gamble, have no debts, no financially needy relatives, etc., so I feel zero pressure to accept bookings. If I had to accept jobs against my better judgment, e.g., someone who’s obviously drunk or aggressive... or demanding services I don’t offer, I would be unsafe."

**Clear Boundaries:** Many participants’ definitions of safety involved ideas of boundaries, psychological well-being, and control. Participants felt safe when their physical and sexual boundaries were respected, as well as when their personal time was respected. P8 described, "Safety is knowing... that my boundaries won’t get crossed, like pushed to have unprotected sex. That I’ll get paid for what I asked and that the hours will be clear and done." For others, feeling safe is directly connected to their ability to control the privacy of their personal information from clients and/or from their social networks. P14 shared, "For me, privacy is when clients don’t know my name or address and can only contact me when I allow it... An unannounced visit from a friend would be something nice. An unannounced visit from a client would be a catastrophe."

**Legality:** For some participants, safety stems from working legally and having access to support services. P6 stated, "I want to be recognized as a legit business. I want to tax my income and also deduct my expenses. I want to qualify for social security. I also want a safe way to advertise and find clients. I want to be protected by law, if a client misbehaves." S22 described how working in environments where clients feared law enforcement—because the location was not in compliance with legal regulation—made their job less safe: "[I want] to work as little as possible in ‘gray / dark’ environments, such that customers [don’t] have the feeling of needing to hide - [then] it is easier for me to vet them ahead of time."

**Access to Community:** Having access to a support community of other sex workers can also be an important component of safety. These communities may be online or offline and can provide emotional or logistical support in the case of a negative experience, or just a place to feel validated and less isolated. S52 identified that to feel safe, it is important for them to "ensure I get things off my chest... with other sex workers in-house or online when I can."

While these communities can provide safety education and resources, participants may face significant barriers to achieving and maintaining them. Policies regulating the use of online platforms for sex-work-related topics, even if not used for sex work itself, threaten the existence of these communities.

#### Perceptions of Risk

We next discuss the sources of risk identified by our participants. Unsurprisingly, clients pose a significant threat. Risks from clients often manifest on multiple safety axes. For example, clients may violate a sex worker’s boundaries by finding their personal Facebook. If the sex worker’s legal name is exposed, this can create risks of stalking and blackmail, which in turn increases risks to their physical security.

However, risk also stems from the legal and technical landscape in which sex work is conducted. Laws that regulate sex work (or business more generally) create opportunities for unwanted information exposure. Similarly, digital platforms create information exposure risks through the ways they moderate content and (dis)allow sexually-explicit uses, which may threaten the financial security and physical safety of participants. Even the non-sexual policies of digital platforms, like "real name" requirements and people recommendation algorithms, create privacy risks for sex workers.

**Risks from Clients:** Clients were often the most direct threat to workers’ physical safety. Several participants shared stories of physical assault, while many others discussed experiences with harassment and stalking. P17 shared, "If you decide to close the [work] relationship, [some clients] become obsessive. A couple of times... I have been blackmailed, threatened they’d expose my activities online to my peers and family. Others have just shown up on my place of work looking for me... It’s very unsettling, but with the right precautions, I’ve learned to avoid it. I’d much rather lose money than meet someone with potential to cause problems."

Efforts to avoid dangerous clients may threaten a participant’s financial security. Furthermore, the threat of stalking and blackmail from clients often led participants to focus not only on physical safety but also on the importance of privacy. Keeping their real name and location private from clients was crucial for staying safe both online and offline. P11 stated, "I don’t want clients to show up at my university or worse, at my flat. Some clients can get attached." P24 had similar concerns and shared a story illustrating the intersection between privacy and physical safety: "My lovely partner, who is also a photographer, has photographed me a couple of times. I wasn’t very smart and published my photos with his tag on a relatively public forum... Then, a client of mine who was very fond of me—which I also wasn’t totally aware of—did some research and figured out who my boyfriend is. He found our places of work and started sending threatening messages."
