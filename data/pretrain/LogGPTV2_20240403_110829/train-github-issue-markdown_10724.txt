Hello,
I just tried VS Code recently and I was surprised to see it didn't exclude the
files and folders listed in my `.gitignore` file.
I think an option allowing us to hide those files in the Explorer would be
really nice.
Here is how Atom does it:

And when this option isn't on, Atom colorizes the excluded files like that:
