User: I'm developing python application which works on aws beanstalk environment. For error handling and debugging proposes I write logs to custom lof file on the directory /var/logs/. 
What should I do in order to have ability snapshot logs from Elastic beanstalk management console?
Assistant: If you need have ability to snapshot log files from Beanstalk management console, you should just write you log files to "/opt/python/log/" folder. Elastic beanstalk scripts use this folder for log tailing.
