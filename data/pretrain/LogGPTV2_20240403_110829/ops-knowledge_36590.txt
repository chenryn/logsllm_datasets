User: Please describe the main differences between HTTP and HTTPS and the port numbers used by each protocol.
Assistant: The main difference between HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is security and data encryption. The data transmitted by HTTP is plain text and can be intercepted and eavesdropped, while HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS encryption protocol to ensure the security of data transmission. HTTPS uses encryption technology to ensure the security of transmission and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and data theft. HTTP, on the other hand, does not have these protections, so data transmission is at risk. The HTTPS protocol also requires authentication between the server and the client. The port number used by the HTTP protocol is 80, and the port number used by the HTTPS protocol is 443.
