User: Introduce the working principles of HTTPS and HTTP protocols respectively, and compare their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting data, and is often used to obtain HTML pages in the World Wide Web. HTTP uses TCP as the underlying transport protocol and uses port number 80 for communication. HTTP is a stateless protocol, each request and response are independent, and the server will not save the information requested by the client. HTTP is based on clear text transmission, which is easy to be eavesdropped, tampered with and forged, and has low security. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Security Protocol) is a secure communication protocol and a security-enhanced version of the HTTP protocol. HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt data transmission, which can effectively protect data security. HTTPS uses TCP as the underlying transport protocol and uses port number 443 for communication. HTTPS uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the server and client, protecting data from man-in-the-middle attacks. The security of the HTTPS protocol is high, but the encryption calculation will increase the burden on the server, resulting in a slow transmission speed. At the same time, it is necessary to purchase a certificate to ensure the credibility of identity verification, and the cost is high. Comparison of advantages and disadvantages: HTTP advantages: 1. Easy to use, easy to develop and implement. 2. The transmission speed is relatively fast, and the content of the web page can be obtained quickly. 3. Low cost, no certificate overhead. HTTP disadvantages: 1. Insecure, easy to be attacked. 2. Data transmission is in clear text, which is easy to be eavesdropped, tampered with and forged. 3. Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Advantages of HTTPS: 1. It is safe and reliable, and can effectively protect data security. 2. Credible authentication, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks. 3. Avoid security issues such as being hacked. Disadvantages of HTTPS: 1. Encrypted calculations will increase the burden on the server, resulting in slower transmission speed. 2. It is necessary to purchase a certificate to ensure the credibility of identity verification, and the cost is relatively high. 3. Very strong security protection sometimes affects the speed of web pages.
