User: I'm writing a chat application using Google App Engine. I would like chats to be logged. Unfortunately, the Google App Engine datastore only lets you write to it once per second. To get around this limitation, I was thinking of using a memcache to buffer writes. In order to ensure that no data is lost, I need to periodically push the data from the memcache into the data store. 
Is there any way to schedule jobs like this on Google App. Engine? Or am I going about this in entirely the wrong way?
I'm using the Python version of the API, so a Python solution would be preferred, but I know Java well enough that I could translate a Java solution into Python.
Assistant: i think you would be fine by using the chat session as entity group and save the chat messages .
this once per second limit is not the reality, you can update/save at a higher rate and im doing it all the time and i don't have any problem with it.
memcache is volatile and is the wrong choice for what you want to do. if you start encountering issues with the write rate you can start setting up tasks to save the data.
