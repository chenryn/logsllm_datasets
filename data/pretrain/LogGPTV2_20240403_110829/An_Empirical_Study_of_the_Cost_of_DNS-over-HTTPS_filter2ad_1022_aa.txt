## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial component for almost every networked application. Initially designed as an unencrypted protocol, it has raised significant security concerns. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) is the latest proposal aimed at enhancing the security of name resolution.

In this paper, we examine the current DoH ecosystem, with a particular focus on the cost of the additional security. We begin by surveying the current landscape of public DoH servers, evaluating their standard compliance and supported features. We then compare different secure DNS transport protocols to highlight the improvements DoH offers over its predecessor, DNS-over-TLS (DoT). These improvements partly explain the significantly higher adoption rate of DoH compared to DoT.

Finally, we quantify the overheads introduced by the additional layers in the DoH transport and their impact on web page load times. Our findings indicate that these overheads have a limited impact on page load times, suggesting that it is feasible to achieve improved security with only a marginal performance impact.

## 1 Introduction
Introduced in 1983, the Domain Name System (DNS) has become a critical component of the Internet. Beyond its original purpose of domain name resolution, DNS has gained importance due to its extensive use by Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) for traffic redirection [5, 8]. Most modern websites include content from third parties, necessitating multiple DNS queries [7] to access a single page. Figure 1 illustrates the number of DNS queries required to fully retrieve each page from the Alexa global top 100k sites. Each website was accessed using Firefox, with logging enabled at the stub resolver. The caches of both Firefox and the DNS stub resolver were cleared before requesting the next website. The figure shows that multiple DNS queries per page are common, with about 50% of the sites requiring at least 20 DNS queries.

DNS impacts networked application performance [6] and can reveal information about the destination of a connection [4]. To address growing security concerns, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [11] and more recently DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [10] have been proposed within the IETF. These protocols enhance security by establishing a TLS session between the client and the resolver. In the case of DoH, this TLS session also includes an HTTP connection. While DoT has seen limited adoption, DoH has gained substantial momentum, with support from major players like Mozilla, Cloudflare, and Google [13].

In this paper, we explore the implications of securing DNS with DoH and compare it with DoT to understand the reasons behind the increased interest in DoH. Our main contributions are:
1. A survey and characterization of the current landscape for secure DNS via HTTP and TLS.
2. A comparison of different transport protocols for securing DNS resolution to understand the momentum behind DoH.
3. Quantification of the overheads introduced by the additional HTTP and TLS layers in DoH.
4. An initial analysis of the impact of switching to DoH on web performance, specifically DNS resolution times and page load times.

## 2 The DoH Landscape
To better understand the current landscape of DoH resolvers, we used the list of DoH servers curated by the curl project [1] and assessed their supported feature set. We initially retrieved all information on October 10, 2018, and verified and updated entries on September 10, 2019.

Table 1 shows that major players such as Google, Cloudflare, and IBM (Quad9), along with some smaller players, support DoH. There is diversity in their service configurations. While different base URLs for each service are expected, it is surprising to see four different URL paths (/, /resolve, /dns-query, /family-filter) among these nine providers. Google even uses different paths for two different services with the same base URL. Although the DoH RFC [10] does not mandate a specific path and leaves it up to the service operators, most services still use the path /dns-query, which is the one used in all examples in the RFC. Given the efforts to obtain easy-to-remember and easy-to-configure IP addresses for UDP-based DNS servers [12, 24], the variety and choices for DoH service parameters are noteworthy. When we first collected this information in October 2018, we observed six different base paths for the same set of providers, but now we only observe four.

We now examine the features supported by the individual resolvers. HTTP supports the transmission of different content types. According to the DoH RFC, all DoH servers and clients must support the application/dns-message content type, which essentially encapsulates the UDP DNS wire format in HTTPS. Another widely supported type is application/dns-json, which represents DNS messages in JSON format. While a draft RFC for the JSON DNS format [3] exists, its support is not mandatory for DoH servers. The application/dns-message content type is supported by all implementations except Google's. Google operates two different services with two different paths (/resolve and /dns-query) on the same domain, with each service supporting only one content type. Curiously, the service supporting the RFC-mandated format was initially named /experimental and has since been renamed to /dns-query. This highlights that operators have recognized the confusion caused by too many different URLs.
