Question: Considering the prevention of eavesdropping during user authentication, which of the following statements are true regarding the use of SSL/TLS over HTTPS compared to a hypothetical browser-based challenge-response protocol using JavaScript for password handling?
"A": "SSL/TLS encrypts the entire communication channel, thereby offering broader security beyond just the password.",
"B": "A browser-based challenge-response protocol would prevent the password from being sent over the network, which is not always true for SSL/TLS.",
"C": "The browser-based protocol may not be as widely supported or standardized as SSL/TLS, leading to potential compatibility issues.",
"D": "SSL/TLS is less secure than the browser-based protocol because it only encrypts the password, not the entire session."
