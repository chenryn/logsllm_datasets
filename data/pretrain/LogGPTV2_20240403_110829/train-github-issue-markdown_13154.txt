Currently, the carousel only supports one transition effect: a sliding motion between images. It would be beneficial to add a fade effect as an additional option.

For reference, I have implemented a similar feature in a small project. You can find an example of this implementation in the following link:
[bootstrap-more.css#L493](https://github.com/GuillaumeAmat/bootstrap-more/blob/master/bootstrap-more.css#L493)
