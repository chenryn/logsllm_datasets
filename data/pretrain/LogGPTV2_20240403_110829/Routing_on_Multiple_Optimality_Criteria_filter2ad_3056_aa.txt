Abstract: This article presents an efﬁcient parametric
optimization method for the biobjective optimal routing
problem. The core process is a bounded greedy single-
objective shortest path approximation algorithm. This
method avoids the computationally intensive dominance
check with labeling methods and overcomes the deﬁ-
ciency with existing parametric methods that can only
ﬁnd extreme nondominated paths. Moreover, we propose
a decomposition scheme to convert a multiobjective rout-
ing problem into a number of biobjective problems. We
then compare its computational performance against the
classic label-correcting method over a set of synthetically
generated random networks and illustrate its algorithmic
advances and solution behaviors by an example applica-
tion of routing hazardous materials in a U.S. northeast-
ern highway network.
1 INTRODUCTION
Optimal routing with respect to multiple performance
measures poses important theoretical
interests and
practical applications. Such problems are ubiquitous
across transportation, distribution, and communication
networks (Current and Marsh, 1993; Boffey, 1995).
They not only arise as stand-alone applications in
their own right but also are often embedded as
subroutines into more complex network optimization
problems. The key algorithmic concern regarding a mul-
tiobjective routing problem is to identify a set of optimal
routes that cover all possible or representative trade-
offs between conﬂicting objectives, so that a subsequent
or interactive comparative assessment of cost-effective
scenarios can be made.

An important application area of multiobjective opti-
mal routing is the transportation of hazardous materials.
Shipments of hazardous materials, including ﬂammable,
explosive, poisonous, corrosive, and radioactive sub-
stances, liquids, or gases, as well as miscellaneous goods
that are harmful to humans and the environment,
constitute a signiﬁcant part of the freight transporta-
tion commodities in the United States, and their vol-
ume is continuously increasing in recent decades. It
was estimated that in the early 1980s, approximately
250,000 hazardous materials shipments were carried
daily through the U.S. transportation system; this num-
ber has reached a level of over 800,000 per day in
the year of 1998, which is by weight approximately
8.8 million tons (Rothberg and Hassan, 2000; Roth-
berg, 2001). Along with the increasing number of haz-
ardous material shipments, the public is increasingly
concerned about the potential risk to the population
and environment caused by trafﬁc accidents involving
hazardous materials vehicles. The recently issued Haz-
ardous Material Transportation Safety Reauthorization
Act of 2001 emphasizes the importance of improving
the routing regulation and operations for hazardous ma-
terials transportation.
The multiobjective setting and requirement for the
hazardous materials routing problem reﬂect the prob-
lem’s multifaceted nature. In general, a number of
decision factors, such as efﬁciency, safety, and environ-
ment concern, must be taken into account in making
routing decisions, which bear impact on different parties
or stakeholders (e.g., the shipper, carrier, and affected
populations). As a synthetic consideration, for example,
we may incorporate the following objectives into the
formulation of a hazardous materials routing problem,
such as minimization of travel distance (or travel time
or transportation cost), minimization of accident rate,
78

minimization of the affected population size (Turnquist,
1987; Nozick et al., 1997; Chang et al., 2005; Souleyrette
and Sathisan, 1994). In this example, although it is rea-
sonable to combine the second and third objectives to
generate a new performance measure named risk ex-
posure (e.g., Zografos and Davis, 1989), which is the
product of population size and accident rate, further
combination does not seem to be appropriate. This in-
commensurability between objectives necessitates the
explicit inclusion of multiple objectives into a single op-
timal routing problem.
Nevertheless, in either the triobjective or the biob-
jective hazardous materials routing case, major changes
with modeling complexity and solution algorithms oc-
cur as the number of objectives increases from one to
two. Suppose a multiattribute directed network G =
(V, E, N), where V is the vertex or node set, E is the
edge or arc set, and N is the attribute set of edges or
arcs. Every arc (i, j) ∈ E is associated with a set of at-
tributes speciﬁed by N and its attribute vector is ci j =
(c1,i j , c2,i j , . . . , cn,i j ), where |N| = n. Given origin node
r and destination node s, an optimal routing problem
with n objectives is to ﬁnd all efﬁcient or nondominated
paths between r and s in terms of the n path attributes,
where it is assumed that all arc attributes are nonneg-
ative and additive along paths, or in other words, this
optimal routing problem is of the min-sum type or is
simply called a shortest path problem. We say that a
path is efﬁcient or nondominated if there does not exist
any feasible path that is superior to this path in terms of
each of the attributes/objectives. An n-objective short-
est path problem (P1) can be in general written into the
following vector form:

objective counterpart. However, different from the
single-objective problem, the integrality constraint (3)
is required in the multiobjective model; otherwise, opti-
mal solutions may contain nonintegral numbers, which
fail to represent individual paths. Due to the imposi-
tion of such an integrality requirement, a multiobjec-
tive shortest path problem is known as an NP-complete
problem in its worst case (see Garey and Johnson, 1979;
Hansen, 1979). A numerical example shown in Figure 1
illustrates the requirement of the integrality constraint
to the biobjective shortest path problem.
For illustration, we are only concerned about ﬁnd-
ing shortest paths from node 1 to node 4 in the
example network. If we consider the shortest path prob-
lem with respect to the ﬁrst objective only, the result-
ing shortest path is 1-3-4, which corresponds to the op-
timal values of the decision variables: x12 = 0, x13 = 1,
x23 = 0, x24 = 0, and x34 = 1; if we consider the short-
est path problem with respect to the second objective,
the shortest path is 1-2-3-4, where the corresponding
optimal values of the decision variables are: x12 = 1,
x13 = 0, x23 = 1, x24 = 0, and x34 = 1. Without the in-
tegrality requirement, the optimal solution of a single-
objective shortest path problem automatically implies a
single path. Then, we consider the shortest path prob-
lem with both objectives. If the integrality constraint is
still not imposed, we obtain the nondominated solution
set {x12 = α, x13 = 1 − α, x23 = α, x24 = 0, and x34 =
1} and the nondominated objective vector set {(3+3α,
6−α)}, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. It is readily known that no so-
lution from the nondominated solution set indeed rep-
resents an individual path unless α = 0 or α = 1.
The focus of this article is the deterministic multiob-
jective shortest path problem presented. This class of
shortest path problems has been tackled by various so-
lution strategies, including labeling methods (Hansen,
1979; Daellenbach and De Kluyver, 1980; Martins,
1984; Cox, 1984; Tung and Chew, 1988, 1992; Vincke,
1974; Loui, 1983; Warburton, 1987; Brumbaugh-Smith
and Shier, 1989; Skriver and Anderson, 2000), rank-
ing methods (Cl´ımaco and Martins, 1982), constraint

(Lawler, 1976), and parametric methods
(Robbins, 1983; Henig, 1985; Current et al., 1990;
Coutinho-Rodrigues et al., 1999; White, 1982; Mote
et al., 1991). A multiobjective shortest path problem
could be also treated by heuristic or metaheuristic meth-
ods such as compromise programming (e.g., Lounis and
Vanier, 2000), genetic algorithm (e.g., Liu et al., 1997),
simulated annealing (e.g., Paya et al., 2008), ant system
(e.g., Vitins and Axhausen, 2009), hybrid metaheuristic
(e.g., Rama Mohan Rao and Shyju, 2010). For extensive
surveys of general optimal routing problems, interested
readers are referred to Current and Marsh (1993), Bof-
fey (1995), and Raith and Ehrgott (2009).
The labeling methods constitute the major part of ex-
isting multiobjective shortest path solution techniques.
The labeling methods include two types: label-setting
methods (Hansen, 1979; Daellenbach and De Kluyver,
1980; Martins, 1984; Cox, 1984; Tung and Chew, 1988,
1992) and label-correcting methods (Vincke, 1974;
Loui, 1983; Warburton, 1987; Brumbaugh-Smith and
Shier, 1989; Skriver and Anderson, 2000), in terms of
how label sets are updated at nodes and how short-
est path labels “converge” to the optimal set. Either
type of labeling methods is a multidimensional exten-
sion of its single-objective counterpart. The key algo-
rithmic feature distinguishing a multiobjective labeling
procedure from its single-objective version is merely
the storage of multilabel vectors and the use of the
vector dominance rule at each node in the dynamic
updating process. Because of this relatively simple al-
gorithmic logic and ease of implementation, labeling
methods have become the dominating solution algo-
rithm for the hazardous materials routing problem (see
Turnquist, 1987; Nozick et al., 1997; Chang et al., 2005;
Cox, 1984; Miller-Hooks and Mahmassani, 1998; Erkut,
1995, 2007). However, given the nondomination nature
of solutions, the number of the label sets at a node
(|V| − 2)!/ (|V| − 2 − k)! in
could be as high as
the worst case, where |V| is the total number of nodes
in the network (Tung and Chew, 1992), which makes it
difﬁcult for this type of solution method to be applied to
large networks.

The major contribution of this article is the develop-
ment of a parametric algorithm that can efﬁciently ap-
proximate the nondominated path set of a multiobjec-
tive shortest path problem. In particular, we present a
polynomial-time solution procedure that can potentially
identify both extreme and nonextreme nondominated
paths through an iterative constrained single-objective
shortest path search. Despite that it does not guaran-
tee the completeness of the nondominated solution set,
the algorithm’s performance is positively justiﬁed by
promising results in our tests; it also identiﬁes “repre-
sentative” solution points that can sketch the nondomi-
nated solution proﬁle in just a few initial iterations. This
latter feature makes it particularly attractive in the cir-
cumstance that we need to make a routing decision in a
prompt manner.
We structure this article as follows. We ﬁrst dis-
cuss the deﬁciencies of existing parametric methods and
present our algorithmic considerations that overcome
these deﬁciencies, which result in a constrained para-
metric algorithm and a problem decomposition scheme
for problems with three or more objectives. Then, the
characteristic and advantage of these algorithmic ad-
vances are illustrated in detail through a hazardous ma-
terials transportation case study in a U.S. northeast-
ern highway network. Finally, the research ﬁndings are
summarized and further research directions suggested
in the last section.
2 PARAMETRIC ALGORITHM
2.1 Existing parametric methods
Parametric methods for multiobjective shortest path so-
lutions appear in the literature in two types. The ﬁrst
type uses a parameterized utility function combining all
the objectives so as to convert a multiobjective problem
into a series of single-objective shortest path problems
with a range of parameter values (Robbins, 1983; Henig,
1985; Current et al., 1990; Coutinho-Rodrigues et al.,
1999). Each parameter in the utility function serves as
a weight for its corresponding objective; nondominated
solutions are obtained sequentially through exhaust-
ing the parameter range and solving the correspond-
ing parameterized problem. This solution strategy orig-
inates from Cohon’s (1978) noninferior set estimation
(NISE) method for multiobjective linear programming
(MOLP) problems. The second type resorts to a linear
relaxation of the original integer-restricting functional
form of the multiobjective problem (White, 1982; Mote
et al., 1991). Extreme nondominated solutions, which all
belong to the extreme solution set of the relaxed lin-
ear program, can be readily identiﬁed by the pivoting
operation of a multiobjective simplex method. In the
simplex solution framework, the pivoting operation it-
eratively moves the search from one extreme solution
to another adjacent extreme one along the boundary of
the feasible solution region of the relaxed linear pro-
gram. Although both types of parametric methods rely
on a linear relaxation to the original problem, the differ-
ence between them is that the former type of methods
solves a set of single-objective LP problems while the
latter directly deals with a multiobjective LP problem.

Xie & Waller
A common algorithmic feature pertaining to the
parametric methods is that nondominated solutions
are generated individually as a sequence, each of
which can be solved in general by some polynomial-
time algorithm. Those “independent” individual solu-
tion searches may be conducted in a parallel manner,
which further reduces the required computational time
through implementing parallel processing techniques.
Moreover, as needed, the order of generating individ-
ual solutions may be customized to give priority to those
most “representative” solution points. This character-
istic is very useful as in many cases it is not necessary
to present all the nondominated solutions to the deci-
sion maker but a subset of key solutions supporting the
nondominated proﬁle. In an actual computational pro-
cess, we may suspend the solution search when the num-
ber and range of collected nondominated solutions have
satisﬁed a certain threshold. Because of this ﬂexibility,
a parametric method can be used in a variety of differ-
ent objective preference information environments, in-
cluding a priori, a posteriori, or interactive preference
articulation cases.
However, the deﬁciency of existing parametric meth-
ods is also apparent: they can only ﬁnd a subset of
nondominated solutions, that is, extreme nondominated
solutions, which are those minimizing convex combi-
nations of individual objectives. Unless all the objec-
tives are commensurate with each other, the extreme
solution set cannot in general represent the whole non-
dominated solution set. Here the commensurability im-
plies that different objectives can be quantitatively mea-
sured by some common standard. For example, given
two routing objectives, travel cost and travel time, we
say that two objectives are commensurable if there ex-
ists a value of time and hence travel time can be con-
verted to and evaluated in terms of monetary cost. The
reason for this partial solution problem is that use of
a utility function or linear relaxation yields a more ag-
gressive vector dominance condition, which in princi-
ple omits all nonextreme solutions. Due to this rea-
son, parametric methods at best can only be believed
as heuristic algorithms, or they must be jointly used
with other methods that are capable of ﬁnding nonex-
treme nondominated solutions. In fact, such a mixed so-
lution strategy has been suggested in a few paramet-
ric algorithm implementations. For example, Current
et al. (1990) used their NISE-like parametric algorithm
with an auxiliary constrained shortest path algorithm;
Coutinho-Rodrigues et al. (1999) suggested a combina-
tion of an NISE-like algorithm and a k-shortest path al-
gorithm; Mote et al. (1991) developed a two-phase pro-
cedure that uses a multicriterion simplex method in the
ﬁrst phase and then a label correcting method in the sec-
ond phase.
In addition, it must be noted that though these para-
metric methods have been successfully developed for
biobjective shortest path problems, it does not seem
straightforward to extend the algorithmic procedure
to deal with problems with three or more objectives.
Some researchers, for example, Boffey (1995), sug-
gested treating extra objectives more than two as side
constraints or subsidiary objectives. Such a treatment,
however, might ignore some attractive nondominated
solutions to the original problem. Because of this mul-
tidimensional difﬁculty, it is not surprising that all the
parametric methods listed above have only been ap-
plied to biobjective cases.
2.2 A generic biobjective solution framework
Prior to discussing our parametric method, it is neces-
sary to interpret a couple of fundamental terms we will
use throughout this text, namely, extreme and nonex-
treme nondominated solutions, and full and partial non-
dominated objective sets.
The notion of extreme solutions plays an important
role in understanding the algorithmic behavior of a
parametric method. A solution x to a multiobjective
shortest path problem formulated as (1) is an extreme
solution, if it cannot be represented as a strict convex
