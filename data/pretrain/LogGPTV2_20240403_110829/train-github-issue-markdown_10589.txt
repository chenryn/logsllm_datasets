### Expected Behavior
I am trying to stop the second instance under special circumstances (which is
not being over the registered protocol/scheme).
### Actual Behavior
I identify the second instance and call app.quit() but the application window
still appears. I tried app.exit() instead with no luck.  
The application continues to open up (new windows). I also notice no calls
made to these events after calling quit() or exit():
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {  
console.log('window-all-closed ', process.platform);
});
app.on('before-quit', () => {  
console.log('before-quit');  
mainWindow.close();  
});
app.on('activate', () => {  
console.log('activate is called');  
if (mainWindow === null) {  
mainWindow = windowLauncher.createWindow();  
}  
});
as the console.log does not write anything in the output.
### To Reproduce
call app.requestSingleInstanceLock() and try to quit the app if no lock could
be gained from the call.
### Screenshots
### Additional Information
here is my code:
`const gotTheLock: boolean = app.requestSingleInstanceLock(); if (!gotTheLock)
{ console.log('second instance identified, closing the app'); app.quit();
console.log('quit() was called'); }`
