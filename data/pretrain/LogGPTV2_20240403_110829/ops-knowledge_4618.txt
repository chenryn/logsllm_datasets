User: We now need to build a highly available database system to ensure that the database is not disconnected and can respond to read and write requests quickly. Please provide a solid database schema design.
Assistant: The following is a high-availability database architecture design based on master-slave replication: 1. Use master-slave replication architecture: By connecting a master database and multiple slave databases together, the data of the master database is synchronized to all slave databases. . The master database is responsible for handling all write operations (addition, deletion, modification), and the slave database is only responsible for read operations (check). If the master database fails, the slave database can automatically take over and become the master database to ensure the continuity of the system. 2. Database load balancing: distribute the load to different servers to share the pressure of the database. Soft load balancing tools, such as LVS or HAProxy, can be used. 3. Database backup strategy: back up the database once a day, and store the backup data in different places, such as local hard disk, cloud storage, etc. In addition, full data checksums can be performed periodically to ensure the integrity and availability of backup data. 4. Monitoring and early warning: By monitoring the running status of the database, ensure the stable operation of the system. You can use monitoring tools (such as Zabbix, Nagios, etc.) to monitor the running status of the database and send alerts, as well as record the historical records of database-related indicators for analysis and optimization. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish a problem feedback mechanism and an emergency handling process in order to respond to emergencies in a timely manner. 5. Security policy: Take necessary security measures, such as encryption, access control, etc., to ensure the security of the database and data. At the same time, the database auditing function can also be enabled to record the database access history for auditing and monitoring. The above is a high-availability database architecture design scheme based on master-slave replication, which can be further optimized and adjusted according to the company's actual needs and business characteristics.
