ABSTRACT
Online tracking of users in support of behavioral advertis-
ing is widespread. Several researchers have proposed non-
tracking online advertising systems that go well beyond the
requirements of the Do-Not-Track initiative launched by the
US Federal Trace Commission (FTC). The primary goal of
these systems is to allow for behaviorally targeted advertis-
ing without revealing user behavior (clickstreams) or user
proﬁles to the ad network. Although these designs purport
to be practical solutions, none of them adequately consider
the role of the ad auctions, which today are central to the
operation of online advertising systems. This paper looks at
the problem of running auctions that leverage user proﬁles
for ad ranking while keeping the user proﬁle private. We
deﬁne the problem, broadly explore the solution space, and
discuss the pros and cons of these solutions. We analyze
the performance of our solutions using data from Microsoft
Bing advertising auctions. We conclude that, while none of
our auctions are ideal in all respects, they are adequate and
practical solutions.

INTRODUCTION
Third-party tracking of users is widespread and increas-
ing [17]. One of the primary purposes of user tracking is
behavioral advertising. Although many companies that par-
ticipate in tracking and behavioral proﬁling claim to not
gather Personally Identifying Information (PII), it is often

easy to link tracking information with PII [16]. Concern
over tracking continues to grow, and has led for instance to
the Do-Not-Track initiative launched by the Federal Trace
Commission (FTC), and proposals for a do-not-track reg-
istry [23]. Do-not-track, however, requires a public that is
largely unaware of tracking to opt-out. It also forces a trade-
oﬀ between tracking and behavioral targeting: a compromise
that industry is not prepared to make. Not surprisingly, do-
not-track has not gained a lot of traction with the public,
and ad networks are actively ﬁghting it.
Several recent research projects take a diﬀerent tack (Ad-
nostic [24], Nurikabe [18], and Privad [13]). Rather than
simply opting out of tracking, or pushing for data-protection
after the fact, they propose alternative advertising technolo-
gies that allow for behavioral targeting without requiring
tracking. These are meant to be practical alternatives that
industry ﬁnds attractive. None of these systems, however,
adequately explore how to operate the auctions that are
critical to current advertising systems. Without this com-
ponent, these systems leave unanswered what revenue the
broker (i.e. an ad network like Google) can earn, thereby
reducing the likelihood that a non-tracking1 advertising sys-
tem will be of commercial interest. In this paper, we look at
the problem of running auctions that leverage a user proﬁle
for ad ranking while keeping the user proﬁle private.
Although the non-tracking advertising systems cited
above diﬀer in signiﬁcant ways, they all share several key de-
sign components. All systems propose a software agent that
runs at the client and generates a user proﬁle. All systems at
least share the privacy goal that this proﬁle not be revealed.
All these designs propose that the broker transmit multiple
ads to the client, not all of which match the user proﬁle. For
instance, the ads may all be within a given interest category.
The client then locally selects from among these ads which
best match the user proﬁle, and display these to the user.
The client reports the result of this selection anonymously,
and without letting the broker link together diﬀerent com-
ponents of the user proﬁle. The key privacy mechanisms are
therefore anonymity and unlinkability.
What does this have to do with auctions? The most
common pricing model for online advertising systems to-
day is Pay Per Click (PPC): the advertiser does not pay
the broker for showing an ad to a user, rather it pays
only if the user clicks on an ad. The broker selects which
ads to show through an auction whereby advertisers bid
against each other.
In a PPC system, the broker maxi-
mizes revenue by ranking the competing ads according to

highest ranking ads to the client where they are displayed in
rank order. Of course, the broker doesn’t know the precise
click probability for every ad. Rather, the broker tries to
predict the click probability as best it can. This prediction
is based on a number of inter-related factors such as the ad
keywords, the landing page keywords, the user search terms
or keywords associated with the web-page being browsed,
stored user characteristics, and so on.
The user proﬁle has a strong eﬀect on click probability. To
give a simple example, say a user searches for “running shoe”.
Whether the user is a man or a woman, or prefers brand-
name products or discount products, plays an important role
in which running shoe ad he or she is more likely to click on.
In a do-not-track compliant advertising system, the broker
does not know the user proﬁle:
if the auction takes place
at the broker in the same way that it does today, then the
user proﬁle will not be factored into the result. Therefore
the highest Bid × ClickP robability ads won’t be selected,
leading to less revenue than should otherwise be possible.
This paper characterizes the problem, and proposes three
basic solutions, one of which is a variant of a method pro-
posed in [12]. Following the lead of the initial work on non-
tracking advertising, this paper takes a pragmatic approach
to the problem. It looks for a good trade-oﬀ between strict
privacy guarantees and practical business and deployment
concerns. As such, this paper explores the pros and cons of
the three approaches in terms of not just privacy (both user
and advertiser), but also revenue, overhead, and vulnerabil-
ity to attack.
It uses around 2TB of auction traces from
Microsoft Bing to guide and validate the design choices.
Altogether, this paper makes the following contributions:
1) It proposes two new non-tracking auction designs, and
a third based on the previous work but substantially im-
proved. 2) It analyzes the trade-oﬀs between these three
designs in terms of privacy properties, auction properties,
and fraud resistance. 3) It analyzes the eﬀect of bid churn
and auction timing on revenue and ad ranking using a trace
of Bing search advertising auctions, and uses this analysis
to argue for the feasibility of the solutions.
2. BACKGROUND
This section describes how current online advertising sys-
tems such as Google and Microsoft work, and then describes
an abstract alternative advertising model patterned after ex-
isting proposals for non-tracking advertising. In the process,
we establish terminology and deﬁne the basic components.
2.1 Current 2nd Price Ad Systems
In current ad systems [7,11,20], advertisers submit ads to
a broker. Associated with each ad is a bid, one or more
keywords, and optionally some targeting information like
demographics (location, age, gender) or interests. When
a client computer does a search or receives a web page
with adboxes (space to place an ad), the broker identiﬁes
the ads that match the search terms or keywords associ-
ated with the web page, and runs an auction. The auction
ranks the selected ads in order of highest expected revenue
(Bid × ClickP robability), and transmits some number of
ads to the client. As already discussed, many factors are
considered in estimating click probability. In this paper, we
refer to all of these factors taken together as a quality score
Q, where a higher value means higher expected click prob-
ability. Denoting bid as B, the ranking then is in order of
the product (B × Q).
When a user clicks on an ad, the ad ID is transmitted to
the broker. The broker computes Cost per Click (CPC), that
is, the price that the advertiser must pay, using a second-
price auction [8]. In this approach, the price paid is pegged
to the bid of the ad that is ranked immediately below the
clicked ad. To give a simple example, suppose that adver-
tiser A is willing to pay as much as $5 for a click, and ad-
vertiser B is willing to pay $10. In a second-price auction,
A could go ahead and bid $5 and B could bid $10. B would
win, but would only pay incrementally more than A’s (2nd-
price) bid, say $5.01.
Second-price auctions allow bidders to bid the maximum
that they are willing to pay, rather than frequently modify
their bid in search of the value incrementally higher than the
next lower bidder. Speciﬁcally, the CPC is computed as:
Qc (cid:19)
CP C = Bn(cid:18) Qn
where Bn and Qn are the bid and quality score of the next
lower ranked ad, and Qc is the quality score of clicked ad.
This CPC formula captures the minimum amount the ad-
vertiser would have had to bid to beat the next-ranked ad
in a ﬁrst-price auction. Note that it prevents the advertiser
from paying more than it bid, even when the next-ranked in
fact bid more.
2.2 Abstract Non-tracking Advertising
In this section, we describe an abstract non-tracking ad-
vertising system that captures key aspects of the three ex-
isting non-tracking advertising designs.
The principle components of the abstract non-tracking ad-
vertising system include those of today’s tracking systems,
the broker, the client, and the advertiser. A user proﬁle is
stored at the client (i.e. the user’s computer, or a device
trusted by the user: the distinction is not important for our
purposes). Each ad is associated with targeting information.
The user proﬁle is deﬁned as that information needed to de-
termine how well an ad’s targeting matches the user. To
produce the user proﬁle, the client monitors user behavior
(i.e. the user’s searching, browsing, purchases, and so on).
The privacy goals of the abstract non-tracking system are:
• Anonymity: the broker cannot associate any unit of
learned information with any user PII (including net-
work address), and
• Unlinkability:
the broker cannot associate separate
units of learned information with a single (anonymous)
client. This prevents a broker from building up a user
proﬁle, and then associating it with a known user using
externally gathered knowledge.
The broker is assumed to be honest-but-curious. We be-
lieve that this is close to reality (brokers like Google can
generally be trusted to do what they claim they are doing).
Nevertheless, we believe it is wise to avoid making it pos-
sible for brokers to obtain high-value information through
hard-to-detect cheating, and our designs reﬂect this belief.
Figure 1 illustrates the basic architecture and message ex-
change of an abstract non-tracking advertising systems. The
network layer address of all messages is anonymized, which
we represent as an anonymizing proxy. Messages are en-
crypted to prevent viewing by the anonymizing proxy. The

client requests a set of ads of a given type (i.e. for a given
product or service). The request must be generic enough
that a substantial set of clients can have legitimately made
the request (i.e. K-anonymity and L-diversity). A set of ads
matching the type, each with identiﬁer A and associated tar-
geting information, are transmitted to the client and stored.
When an adbox is presented to the client, for instance on a
web page, the client selects among the stored ads those that
best match the user proﬁle, and puts them in the ad box for
viewing by the user. The client reports the view and click of
the ad A on a webpage with the given URL. There is noth-
ing in the messages that allows the broker to link diﬀerent
messages as coming from the same user.
Our model has two necessary channels of communications
between client and broker, ad delivery, and view and click
reporting. Both channels present opportunities for the bro-
ker to learn information contained in user proﬁles, and cur-
rent non-tracking advertising designs protect these channels.
Any new information that must be conveyed for the purpose
of the auction must also be protected.
3. AUCTION GOALS
The privacy goals for the auction component of a non-
tracking advertising system are the same as described in
Section 2: anonymity and unlinkability. This section de-
scribes the goals of the auction itself.
The primary goal of the auction in a non-tracking adver-
tising system is to provide a second-price auction mechanism
that achieves close-to-ideal ranking of ads (i.e., in order of
Bid × ClickP robability). For today’s tracking advertising
systems, leveraging the user proﬁle is straightforward, since
the broker itself accumulates and maintains this informa-
tion.
In a non-tracking system, the broker does not have
user proﬁle information, but does have other information
that goes into the quality score Q. In other words, part of
the information used to produce Q is in the broker, and part
is in the client. Therefore, we deﬁne a user score U which
directly reﬂects the eﬀect of the user proﬁle, when matched
against an ad’s targeting information, on click probability.
We deﬁne a second quality score G, that reﬂects the remain-
ing “global” information known to the broker.
Speciﬁcally, this results in an ideal ranking and CPC of:
Rank ⇒ B × G × U
Gc × Uc (cid:19)
CP C = Bn(cid:18) Gn × Un
(1)
(2)
For example, U could be a positive real value greater or
less than 1 that raises or lowers the click probability propor-
tionally to its eﬀect on the click probability deﬁned by G.
Section 7 brieﬂy discusses how U may be computed.
In current tracking advertising systems, the click normally
takes place almost immediately after the view, and so CPC
is normally computed shortly after the ranking. As a result,
the parameters that go into determining the ranking (B and
Q) do not change much between ranking and CPC. In non-
tracking advertising systems, as explained later, some time
may pass between when B is set by the advertiser and when
the ad is ranked, or between when an ad is ranked and when
CPC is calculated. Therefore, we set the following goals with
respect to ranking and CPC calculation:
• The B, G, and U used for CPC calculation are the
same as the B, G, and U used for ranking. Note in
particular that if they are not the same, then it is
possible for instance for the CPC to be higher than
the submitted bid of the clicked ad.
• The delay between ranking and CPC calculation is
small enough that the churn in B, G, or U does not
have a signiﬁcant impact on rankings, CPC values, and
broker revenue.
What exactly comprises user score U depends on the client
proﬁler and can vary from system to system. We can, how-
ever, classify user information into three time frames. At
the time frame of months or even years are user demograph-
ics like gender, location, language, age, salary, and so on.
User interests can also last years (e.g. coin collecting), but
more typically last weeks (a new car), days (a new pair of
shoes), or minutes (a pizza). If we assume that matching
ads to the content of a web page or search page increases
click probability, then user score can change in seconds or
less. For instance, a user might be interested in tennis and
