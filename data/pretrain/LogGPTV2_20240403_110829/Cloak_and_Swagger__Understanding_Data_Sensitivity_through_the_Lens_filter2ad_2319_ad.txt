4) Topic-based Results: Table III presents statistics for those
35 topics whose A(T ) is three standard deviations above
the mean. As becomes immediately clear from the table, the
most sensitive topics are dominated by the adult themes of
sex, sexuality, sexual orientation, pornography, and by the
theme of drugs. However, even among these, there are outliers:
Lady Gaga, Bathroom Etiquette, University of Pennsylvania,
conﬁrming our hypothesis from the study of contexts that topics
considered sensitive by users are not limited to the obvious
ones, and that education, celebrities, and personal experiences
may be important exception themes.
Similar to the manual analysis done for contexts, we hired
ﬁve workers to label all the 596 Quora topics whose answer
anonymity ratio, A(T ), exceeds one standard deviation above
the mean. As was the case for contexts, a high number of topics,
namely 188, were not associated with any of the conventionally
considered sensitive categories by any of the workers. Our
loose categorization of these topics into themes is presented
in Table II.
The analysis based on topics lends support for all typically
considered sensitive categories, including criminal record, via
high answer anonymity ratios for topics such as: Capital
Punishment, Organized Crime, When the Police Arrest You
or Pull You Over.
B. Discussion of Approach and Findings
1) The Approach: Although we present the results based
only on answer anonymity ratio, A, the results based on
the follower anonymity ratio, F , are quite similar for both
contexts and topics. This is not unexpected, based on previously
mentioned high correlation between the two measures (0.84
in the case of contexts and 0.88 in the case of topics), and
the common sense that given the Quora features, someone
who prefers not to associate one’s interest in a topic with their
real name, would also prefer to answer questions in that topic
anonymously, and vice versa. Several notable exceptions to
this, where A is signiﬁcantly higher than F are the topics
and contexts of: Patent Law, Orgasms, Genitalia; whereas the
situation is reversed for Interviews (Behavioral), Student Loans
and Debt, Immigration.
We have explored two methodologies for inferring sensi-
tivity: one based on contexts (Section IV-A1) and another
based on topics (Section IV-A3), and both yield similar and
consistent results, which adds conﬁdence to the methodology
and robustness of ﬁndings.

2) Search Engine Privacy Impact Mitigation: Furthermore,
it is important to remember that due to the method used for
data collection, we are not able to distinguish between answers
and followers that are truly anonymous versus those that are
marked as such due to “Search Engine Privacy” settings by
those users. Although this is a potentially signiﬁcant limitation,
we believe it has a limited impact on the conclusions made in
the preceding analyses for the following reasons.
Firstly, the “Search Engine Privacy” setting is not enabled
by default on Quora, which likely implies its limited utilization
since users rarely change defaults [45]. Secondly, users who
seek out and choose to enable this setting likely do so
because of the nature of the questions they are following
or answering, and their desire to protect their privacy while
doing so, advancing an argument that actions by users whose
“Search Engine Privacy” setting is enabled should be viewed as a
weaker, but also possibly valid, indicators of sensitivity. Finally,
if the previous argument is not correct, then the limitation due
to search engine privacy should affect all topics and contexts
at an equal rate in expectation, making the absolute anonymity
ratios for topics and contexts higher than the true ones, but
doing so equally, and therefore, enabling correct conclusions
based on the relative comparisons between the average ratios.
To verify the previous two hypotheses, we randomly sampled
100 question URLs which include a context and have at least
6 answers from each of the following groups of questions: our
entire crawl, the 14 contexts with the highest anonymity ratio
(Table I), our crawl excluding the 14 contexts with the highest
anonymity ratio, the contexts ranked 15-28 according to the
anonymity ratio. For each of the 100 questions, we manually
loaded the corresponding Quora page while being signed-in
(and thereby, bypassing the crawl limitation) and noted the
total number of answers and number of anonymous answers
for it. Table IV presents the anonymity ratio computed for each
of the four groups of questions based on the data not subject
to the “Search Engine Privacy” limitation and the data subject
to it. As expected, the true anonymity ratios are lower than the
ones computed based on our crawl, but the relative magnitudes
are unchanged, with questions from contexts ranked 1-14 and
15-28 based on our crawl exhibiting signiﬁcantly higher true
anonymity ratios than the average.

These ﬁndings lend credibility to our hypothesis that the
impact of “Search Engine Privacy” on our conclusion is limited,
as long as we rely on relative, rather than absolute values
of anonymity ratios when comparing contexts and topics for
sensitivity. We base most of our analyses in the subsequent
sections on the data from identiﬁed contexts and topics with
501
high anonymity ratio, and therefore, hope to further mitigate the
impact of our crawl limitation due to “Search Engine Privacy”.
3) Surprising Findings: Although, arguably, many readers
would have predicted that the themes of relationships, law &
government, and personal experiences would be among the
ones for which Quora anonymity features are highly utilized,
there are several themes among our ﬁndings whose prominence
among the topics and contexts for whom anonymity is utilized
is quite unexpected. In particular, we speculate on the reasons
for some of the unexpected ﬁndings:
• Answers to education and educational institution related
questions are often anonymous spurred by questions such
as “What are the downsides of attending Harvard as an
undergrad?”6
• Answers to questions related to particular companies
are often anonymous due to possibility of disclosing
information that only insiders of the company have
access to, e.g., “How do Zynga employees feel about
the company’s summer 2012 stock price drop?”7
• Humor makes the list because of answers or questions that
are not politically correct or may hurt someone’s feelings,
e.g., “What’s the most offensive joke ever?”8
• Celebrities – because users may be interested in the gossip
but not eager to admit it, e.g., “Who are famous people
who had/have relationships with dogs?”9
• Several topics related to online privacy and security also
elicit a high rate of anonymous answers and followers.
One hypothesis for the unifying reason for these seemingly
surprising sensitive themes is that
they combine a topic
with feelings, personal experiences or thoughts, or insider
information. This suggests one avenue for possible future work
in order to develop better privacy-preserving features that would
enable users to share without regrets or negative consequences
– to rely not only on a set of pre-identiﬁed sensitive topics,
but to also evaluate whether the question or its answers may
include personal experiences, feelings, judgements, emotions,
or insider information. Another possible conclusion is one that
supports the main thesis of this research – content sensitivity is
quite nuanced, and one of the core methods to understand and
accommodate users’ preferences should be based on a data-
driven analysis of user actions related to the use of privacy-
enhancing features in the product for which the sensitivity
policies are to be set.
V. SENSITIVE WORDS
In this section, we perform an analysis that compares
vocabulary of anonymous answers with the vocabulary of non-
anonymous answers. As was the case for topics and contexts,

the words that are more prominent in anonymous answers are
not limited to the expected set.
A. Word Data
We limit our analysis of sensitive words to answers from
questions that belong to one of the 243 contexts whose
anonymity ratio, A(C), exceeds the overall average by at
least one standard deviation identiﬁed in Section IV-A2. Such
a choice allows us to partially mitigate the impact of “Search
Engine Privacy” limitation, as the anonymity ratio is higher
in these contexts regardless (see discussion in Section IV-B2).
We do not use word stemming in order to preserve ability to
easily reason about ﬁndings rather than have to guess the word
a particular root form is arising from. Hence, we observe some
root word repetitions in the reported results, e.g., both singular
and plural forms of the same word.
Among the answers analyzed, 60,912 distinct words occur
1,952,979 times. For every word, we calculate its number
of occurrences in anonymous answers and its number of
occurrences in non-anonymous answers. The average number
of occurrences of a word in anonymous answers is 10.2 and
in nonanonymous – 21.8, with the latter being (unsurprisingly)
higher than the former since there are more nonanonymous
answers than anonymous ones. To avoid making statistically
spurious observations, we exclude words with less than 32
(= 10.2 + 21.8) occurrences in total among all answers from
consideration. Among the remaining, reasonably frequent,
5,396 words, we manually identify and remove 114 so-called
stop words (such as “like”, “the”, “and”, “or”, etc.). The
remaining 5,281 words occur a total of 939,849 times. We
analyse these words to identify strong indicators of answer
anonymity and content sensitivity.
B. Analysis Methodologies
We explore two methodologies – one statistical and another
natural language processing based – for identifying words
that are strong indicators of anonymity. We do not claim one
method is better than the other, but only highlight the fact
that multiple analysis approaches exist and may offer slightly
differing perspectives. An online service provider may choose
to combine several such techniques in practice.
1) Statistical Analysis: In our ﬁrst methodology, for each
word, we divide its number of occurrences in anonymous
answers by the total number of all word occurrences in
anonymous answers to obtain its normalized rate of occur-
rence in anonymous answers, RA(W ). Similarly, we com-
pute RN (W ) based on number of the occurrences in non-
anonymous answers. We then compute each word’s anonymity
ratio, A(W ), as RA/RN . We observe that, mean

A(W )

= 0.69.
The intuition behind such choice of measurements is that
a word W that is not relevant to the outcome of whether the
answer is anonymous or not will have approximately the same
rate of occurrence in both types of answers, i.e., RA(W ) ≈
RN (W ), whereas for a word relevant to the outcome, RA
will signiﬁcantly exceed RN . Conﬁrming this, the average and

median of A are both close to 1; whereas there are 159 words
with word anonymity ratio, A(W ), at least three standard
deviations above the mean of A. We present the top 100
words based on their anonymity ratio in Figure 5, formatted
analogously to the coding of contexts in Section IV-A2.
2) Collocation Analysis: In our second methodology, we
apply the likelihood ratio test, typically used in word collocation
discovery in natural language processing [46], to our problem.
We model our sensitive word discovery problem as a
collocation discovery problem, where instead of attempting to
discover a word’s collocation with another word, we look
for signiﬁcant collocations between a word and a label –
“anonymous” or “nonanonymous”, in a corpus obtained by
converting each occurrence of a word w in an anonymous
answer into an instance of w with label “anonymous”, and
each occurrence of w in a nonanonymous answer – into an
instance of w with label “nonanonymous”. The likelihood ratio
test with each label then quantitatively evaluates two alternative
hypotheses – the word being independent or dependent of the
label, with the log likelihood ratio of the maximum likelihood
estimates of those hypotheses enabling ranking of the words
(and their co-occurrence with the label) by their signiﬁcance.
As is standard in NLP [46], we rank collocations in the
decreasing order of −2 times the log of their likelihood ratios.
Since we are interested in identifying sensitive words, we
present the top 100 words co-occurring with the “anonymous”
label in Figure 6.

C. Discussion of Findings
As the two methodologies rely on different underlying
principles, a top ranked word identiﬁed using one methodology
might not appear in the top 100 words obtained using the other
methodology. However, this does not mean that the second
method did not identify any correlation between the speciﬁc
word and anonymity. In fact, though the ordering is different,
we observe a signiﬁcant overlap among the words identiﬁed as
anonymity indicators by the two methods. Even among the top
100 words listed in Figures 5 and 6, there are several overlaps,
such as transgender, proverbs, verifone, leviticus, etc.
As is evident from Figures 5 and 6, the proportion of
words that are not typically considered sensitive among those
identiﬁed as sensitive via our data-driven analysis is quite high.
We manually group the words not typically considered sensitive
and identify several noteworthy themes:
• Law & Government, such as sue, witness
• Companies, such as verifone, zynga, quora, square, acquir-
• Education and Educational Institutions, such as admissions,
colleges, graduates, faculty, dorm, academics, committee
• Relationships, such as relatives, grandfather, neighbors,
• Emotions & Emotional Experiences, such as apology,
laughing, ashamed, aggressively, afﬁrmative, secretly, feel,
denied
grandmother, parents, followers, friends, customers
ing, palantir
• Career, such as modeling, astronauts, ofﬁcers, admins
• Science, such as boson, api, site, technical, science, orbiter
• Arts & Entertainment, such as ﬁction, story
• Travel & Transportation, such as gate
• Social Issues, such as immigration
• Food & Drink, such as cheese, beef, spoon
• People Qualities, such as gorgeous, righteous, faithful,
forgiveness, morality, stereotype
Many of these themes echo the ones identiﬁed in Section IV
and described in Table II, with the exception of the last –
related to People Qualities. There were no analogues for these
in context and topic analyses likely due to the absence of
context and topic labels conveying this theme among those
created by the Quora moderators.
As in the previous section, our ﬁndings support the hypothe-
sis that sensitivity is quite nuanced, and not limited to the typi-
cally considered sensitive topics and words. Concretely, among
the top 200 words identiﬁed using the above methodologies
(100 words from each technique), nearly 73% of words, evoking
the themes of emotions, relationships, career, etc., would be
