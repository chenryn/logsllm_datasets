I tried to update the PowerToys app today and during the process it asked me
to close apps such as Office 365 Suite apps, Slack, Calculator and all my
browsers + a lot more apps. There is no documentation I can find that explains
the reasoning behind these requirements. And I don't see how the installation
would benefit from closing all these other apps, apart from it being tedious
and annoying.
## üìù Provide a description of requested docs changes
It would be great if someone could shed light on these requirements and maybe
explain why it has to be done every time the app is updated (which is quite
frequently).
