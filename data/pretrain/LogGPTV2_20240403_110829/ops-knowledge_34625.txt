Question: "You are tasked with updating an Android app to use the new APK Signature Scheme v3.1. Your app currently targets Android 12 but intends to support future versions. You decide to rotate the app's signing key. Which of the following statements correctly describe the behavior of the app's signatures on different Android versions and the use of the `apksig` library?"
 "A": "Android 13 devices will use the original signer in the v3.1 block, while older versions will use the rotated signer in the v3 block."
 "B": "The `apksig` library will default to using the v3.1 signing block if the `minSdkVersion` is set to Android 13 or higher and a rotated key is provided."
 "C": "Devices running Android 12 or lower will not recognize the block ID of v3.1 and will therefore use the original signer from the v3 block, ignoring the rotated signer."
 "D": "If the app's `minSdkVersion` is set below Android 13, the `apksig` library requires a rotated key without the need for specifying the original signing key."
