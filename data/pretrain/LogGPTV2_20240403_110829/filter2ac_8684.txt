**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Audit

To effectively detect and mitigate hijacking opportunities within an enterprise, it is essential to use auditing tools that can identify and address such vulnerabilities. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework include modules, such as PowerUp, which can be used to explore systems for potential weaknesses.

### Key Recommendations:

1. **Use sxstrace.exe for Manifest File Inspection:**
   - Utilize `sxstrace.exe`, a tool included with Windows, in conjunction with manual inspection to check manifest files for side-loading vulnerabilities in software. This will help identify and correct any issues that could be exploited.

2. **Eliminate Path Interception Weaknesses:**
   - Identify and eliminate path interception weaknesses in program configuration files, scripts, the PATH environment variable, services, and shortcuts.
   - Enclose PATH variables in quotation marks where possible to prevent unintended file execution.
   - Be aware of the search order Windows uses for executing or loading binaries, and use fully qualified paths whenever appropriate to reduce the risk of path hijacking.

3. **Clean Up Old Registry Keys:**
   - Remove old Windows Registry keys when software is uninstalled to avoid leaving behind keys with no associated legitimate binaries. This helps prevent attackers from using these orphaned keys to load malicious code.

4. **Regularly Search for and Correct Path Interception Weaknesses:**
   - Periodically search for and correct or report path interception weaknesses on systems. Use custom or available tools that can identify and report software configurations with insecure path settings.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of hijacking attacks and enhance the overall security posture of your enterprise systems.
