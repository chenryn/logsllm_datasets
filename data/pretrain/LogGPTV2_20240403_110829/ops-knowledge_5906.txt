It appears that the issue you're encountering with `pip` is due to spaces in the Python installation path. To resolve this without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces, you can try the following steps:

1. **Upgrade `pip`**: Ensure that you have the latest version of `pip`. You can upgrade it using the following command:
   ```sh
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Reinstall the packages**: After upgrading `pip`, reinstall the problematic packages. For example, if you were using Django REST framework and SimpleJWT, you can reinstall them with:
   ```sh
   pip uninstall djangorestframework simplejwt
   pip install djangorestframework simplejwt
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to get `pip` to work correctly without needing to change the installation path.
