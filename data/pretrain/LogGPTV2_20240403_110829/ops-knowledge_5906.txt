User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: I had this problem when using django rest framework and simplejwt. All I had to was upgrade pip and reinstall the packages
