### Analysis of DCG over Streaming Channels

The performance of DCG (Dynamic Cognitive Game) over streaming channels was evaluated in terms of solving time and error rate, with the results summarized in Table 5.

#### LSHL Relay Attack Setting
In the LSHL (Low-Speed, High-Latency) relay attack setting, only two participants managed to complete one of the Easy EI-DCG (Emerging Image Dynamic Cognitive Game) variants, and only one participant completed one of the Medium EI-DCG variants. Consequently, the overall error rate for the three categories of EI-DCG averaged 0.99. The average time taken by participants to complete the challenges was 42.68 seconds. Additionally, participants performed a significantly higher number of drag-and-drop actions and attempts compared to those in the usability study. If the number of allowed drags/attempts is limited to 21, the overall error rate for the Easy EI-DCG variant increases to 1.00.

#### HSLL Relay Attack Setting
In the HSLL (High-Speed, Low-Latency) relay attack setting, the error rate decreased from approximately 0.99 to 0.87 on average compared to the LSHL setting. However, the error rate remains high. The completion times and the number of drags and attempts for participants who successfully solved the challenges were comparable to those in the usability study, except for the number of attempts in the Easy variant. Limiting the number of allowed drags/attempts to 21 did not affect the overall error rate. A Mann-Whitney test comparing the successful completion times between each variant of EI-DCG in the usability and streaming-based relay attack studies did not reveal statistically significant differences. Further analysis showed that only 9 out of 48 participants (18.75%) could complete any EI-DCG challenges, with each solving an average of 10.33 out of 15 challenges.

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that EI-DCG is extremely challenging to solve via streaming-based relaying, especially when human solvers are located far away and have slow internet connections. The likelihood of solving EI-DCG challenges marginally increases when solvers are in close proximity and have high-speed internet connections. Even when solvers can complete the CAPTCHA challenges, their gameplay patterns differ from legitimate users, which can be detected.

### Attack Detection Technique
We developed and implemented a machine-learning-based detection mechanism for EI-DCG stream relay attacks. This mechanism leverages differences in participants' performances in the usability study and the HSLL relay attack study. We logged all interactions with the challenges, including mouse events, positions, and object states. From the collected data, we extracted sixteen different features:

- **Number of Drags (ND)**: Total number of drags.
- **Number of Attempts (NA)**: Number of mouse clicks.
- **Distance-based Features**:
  - **Distance Drag (DD)**: Total distance of mouse movement while dragging an object.
  - **Distance Attempts (DA)**: Distance of mouse movement while the mouse status is down but not dragging.
  - **Distance Mouse Up (DU)**: Distance of mouse movement while the mouse status is up.
- **Time-based Features**:
  - **Completion Time (T)**: Total time taken to complete the challenge.
  - **Time Drags (TD)**: Total time during which an object is being dragged.
  - **Time Attempts (TA)**: Time when the mouse is down and no object is being dragged.
  - **Time Mouse Up (TU)**: Time when the mouse status is up.
- **Speed-based Features**:
  - **Speed of Drags (SD)**
  - **Speed of Attempts (SA)**
  - **Speed of Mouse Up (SU)**
- **Acceleration-based Features**:
  - **Acceleration of Drags (AD)**
  - **Acceleration of Attempts (AA)**
  - **Acceleration of Mouse Up (AU)**
- **Max Attempt (MA)**: Maximum time taken in a single attempt.

For each EI-DCG variant, we randomly selected a number of instances of successfully completed challenges in the usability study equal to the number of successfully completed challenges in the HSLL relay attack study. We then implemented a Java program to determine the best subset of features and classifier for each challenge category (Easy, Medium, Difficult). We experimented with various classifiers, including SVM (C-SVC and nu-SVN with linear, polynomial, and radial kernels), Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, Simple Logistic, and Logistic.

Performance measures included Precision, Recall, and F-measure (F1 score). We selected the classifier with the maximum recall to minimize the rejection of legitimate users while maintaining an acceptable precision rate.

### Results
The results of the best classifier and feature subset for each EI-DCG difficulty level are shown in Table 6. The results indicate that a classifier can be effectively built to reject around 11% of legitimate users and detect around 65% of HSLL relay attackers. Given that only 13% of HSLL relay attackers could solve the EI-DCG challenges, our proposed detection method can detect approximately 95% of them. The LSHL relay attack is already prevented with at least 98% probability. This suggests that streaming-based relay attacks generally have a very low chance of success against EI-DCG CAPTCHAs.

### Discussion
EI-DCGs are resilient to streaming-based relay attacks due to the requirement for high data connection speed and low latency. The game size and required frame rate necessitate a minimum connection speed of 2.22 Mbit/s, which is often not achievable in regions with slower internet speeds, such as India. In contrast, the higher average connection speed in the USA allows some human solvers to successfully complete the challenges. Testing with multiple screen-sharing applications, such as TeamViewer and AnyDesk, confirmed similar data rate requirements, validating the generalizability of our findings.

A third relay attack scenario, Small Game Relay, involves reducing the game size to lower the data rate. However, this is not applicable to EI-DCG as it would make object recognition nearly impossible.

### Conclusions
EI-DCG, based on emerging images and dynamic cognitive games, incorporates countermeasures to resist automated object recognition. The higher network delay and lower frame rate on the human-solver's side reduce the likelihood of successful challenge completion. Experiments against both automated and relay attacks demonstrated the robustness of EI-DCG.
