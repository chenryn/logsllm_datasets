When doing some math works in pandas, the rolling function is very useful,
such as pd.rolling().mean() or  
pd.rolling().max().  
Here is my problem: when I want to get a time-series rank in a Series or a
column in DataFrame, there is no function like pd.rolling().rank(). Is there
any function can work as pd.rolling().rank() ?
