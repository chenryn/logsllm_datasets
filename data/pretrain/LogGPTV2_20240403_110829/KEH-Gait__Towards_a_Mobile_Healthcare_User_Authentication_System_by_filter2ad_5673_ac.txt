B. Data Collection
The dataset used to evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed system consists of 20 healthy subjects (14 males and
6 females)5. During the data collection phase, the participants
were asked to hold the data logger in their preferred hand and
walk at their normal speed (0.7-1.1m/s). The data collection
is performed in several environments (indoor and outdoor)
in order to capture the inﬂuence of different
terrains. An
illustration of indoor environment and outdoor environment
is shown in Fig 10(a) and Fig 10(b). The terrain of the chosen
outdoor environment varies including plain, grass and asphalt.
Each volunteer participated in two data collection sessions
that was separated by one week. During each session, the
participants were asked to hold the device (see Fig 10(c)
and Fig 10(d)) and walked along the speciﬁc route shown in
Figure 10(a) and Figure 10(b) for approximately 5 minutes.
Based on the above description, the gait dataset is close to
a realistic environment as it includes the natural gait changes
over time and different environments (indoor and outdoor).
In total, we have collected over 300 seconds of samples for
each subject from the EH devices as well as the accelerometer.
We collect two voltage datasets by using the PEH and EEH
devices, respectively, and perform gait cycle segmentation and
unusual gait cycle deletion on both of the datasets, and ﬁnally
we extract 200 gait cycles from each subject for evaluation.

VI. EVALUATION
A. Goals, Metrics and Methodology
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the pro-
posed system based on the collected dataset. The goals of the
evaluation are threefold: 1) investigate the relation between
recognition accuracy and sampling rate of accelerometer data;
2) compare the recognition accuracy of KEH-Gait with that
of using accelerometer data; 3) compare the proposed clas-
siﬁcation method in KEH-Gait with several state-of-the-art
classiﬁcation algorithms.
In this paper, we focus on the following three evaluation
metrics:
•
•
•
Recognition accuracy: it represents the percentage of
correct classiﬁcations which is simply the number of
true classiﬁcations over the total number of tests.
False positive rate (FPR): probability that the authen-
tication system incorrectly accepts the access request
by an imposter.
False negative rate (FNR): probability that the au-
thentication system incorrectly rejects the access re-
quests from the genuine users.
The recognition accuracy of KEH-Gait
is obtained by
using output voltage in one gait cycle as a test vector. For
fair comparison, we perform the same signal processing and
classiﬁcation method on acceleration data. The only difference
is the test vector is obtained by concatenating acceleration data
along three axes in one gait cycle together. In the evaluation,
we compare MSSRC with Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-
Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB). The intuition
of we use SRC is that it has shown better performance than
traditional classiﬁcation methods (e.g., SVM and KNN) in
recognition tasks of sensor areas such as face recognition [27],
[32] and voice recognition [33]. SRC is known to be robust to
noise because of its use of (cid:96)1 optimization [27]. Thus, we use
SRC in KEH-Gait and improve its performance by exploring
the sparsity of testing vectors as discussed in Section IV-D.
The parameters in SVM, KNN and NB are well tuned to
give highest accuracy. For KNN classiﬁer we set the number
of nearest neighbors as 10. For SVM classiﬁer, we choose
linear kernel function, and the soft margin constant is set 10.
We choose normal Gaussian distribution for NB. For each
classiﬁer, we perform 10-fold cross-validation on the collected
dataset. Speciﬁcally, we randomly split the dataset into 10 folds
with equal size. Then, each fold is retained as the validation
data for testing the classiﬁer, and the remaining 9 folds are used
as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated
10 times, with each of the 10 folds used exactly once as the
testing data. In the evaluation, we let k denote the number
of gait cycles fused to perform classiﬁcation and σ denote
the compression rate. The compression rate means the number
of projections/features over the dimension of original testing
vector. We plot the results of the average values and 95%
conﬁdence level of the recognition accuracy obtained from 10
folds cross-validation.
B. Recognition Accuracy v.s. Sampling Rate
In the ﬁrst experiment, we evaluate the impact of sampling
rate on the gait recognition accuracy of acceleration data. The
goal is to investigate the relation between recognition accuracy
and the consumed power of accelerometer, as the power
consumption is directly related to the sampling rate. We use
MSSRC as the classiﬁer and calculate the recognition accuracy
at different sampling rates by subsampling the acceleration
data from 100Hz to 1Hz. As shown in Figure 11(a),
the
recognition accuracy increases with growing sampling rate.
This is intuitive as the more measurements are sampled, the
more information is available, and thus, enabling more accurate
classiﬁcation. However, the improvement diminishes after the
sampling rate is greater than 40Hz. The results indicate that to
achieve high recognition accuracy, a sampling rate of at least
40Hz is required. In the rest of the evaluation, we limit our
discussion on sampling at 40Hz.
this consumption requirement
As we will discuss in Section VII-B1, the power consump-
tion of accelerometer-based system will increase signiﬁcantly
with the rising sampling frequency. Based on our measurement
results,
the accelerometer-based system consumes approxi-
mately 300µW with 40Hz to achieve accurate recognition.
However,
is far beyond the
actual power generated by the energy harvester (neither PEH,
nor EEH). According to a recent theoretical study of energy
harvesting from human activity [11], assuming 100% con-
version efﬁciency, the power can be harvested from walking
is only 155µW . Unfortunately, in practical, according to our
measurement results, the average power produced from walk-
ing is 19.17µW using EEH, and approximately 1µW using
PEH which is not tuned speciﬁcally for human activity energy
harvesting. In this case, due to the limited amount of power that
is available to power the system, its sampling frequency will
decrease below 40Hz. As a result, the recognition accuracy

will dramatically decrease accordingly. The results highlight
the necessity of using kinetic voltage signal to achieve gait
recognition directly, instead of using the accelerometer signal.
In the next subsection, we will show that the recognition
accuracy of using kinetic voltage signal is comparable to that
of using accelerometer data.
C. KEH-Gait v.s. Accelerometer-based System
In this section, we investigate whether KEH-Gait can
achieve comparable accuracy compared to accelerometer sig-
nal. In case of using accelerometer signal, we calculate the
recognition accuracy at two different sampling rates: 1) raw
sampling rate (100 Hz) of the data logger; and 2) the highest
achievable sampling rate of the accelerometer if it is powered
by the energy harvester. From our dataset, the energy harvester
can generate 19.17 µW on average from walking. Thus,
according to the handbook of MPU9250 which is used in our
prototypes, it can sample at most 8Hz if it is powered by the
energy harvester.
In this experiment, we set k = 1 and calculate the
recognition accuracy by varying compression rate σ from
15% to 100%, and the results are plotted in Figure 11(b).
We can see that the recognition accuracy of using voltage
signal is signiﬁcantly higher than that of using accelerometer
at sampling rate of 8Hz. This suggests that the harvested power
cannot support the accelerometer to sample at a high frequency
which leads to low recognition accuracy; instead, using the
voltage signal
itself is able to achieve higher recognition
accuracy. However, the recognition accuracy of using voltage
signal is still approximately 6% (PEH) and 17% (EEH) below
than that of using raw accelerometer signal when σ = 100%.
We now demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of using
harvested power signal can be improved signiﬁcantly by the
proposed MSSRC, and it reaches a comparable recognition
accuracy compared to using the raw accelerometer signal. In
this experiment, we set σ = 75% as the accuracy improvement
diminishes when the number of projections/features increased
to 200 as shown in Figure 11(b). Then we calculate the
recognition accuracy of KEH-Gait using accelerometer signal
and voltage signal, while increasing k from 1 to 8. From the
results in Figure 11(c), we notice that the recognition accuracy
is improved signiﬁcantly when more gait cycles are fused
together. The result is intuitive as more information can be
obtained to identify the subject by using more gait cycles. We
also ﬁnd that by using voltage signal of PEH, we can achieve
a comparable accuracy compared to using raw accelerometer
signal when k = 8, and the recognition accuracy of EEH is
slightly lower (3%) than using raw accelerometer signal. In the
real application, k can be tuned by the healthcare company to
satisfy their own needs. For example, a larger k makes the
system more secure to the imposters while it sacriﬁces user
experience because it will take more time to collect required
steps.
D. Comparison with Other Classiﬁcation Methods
We now evaluate whether MSSRC outperforms other state-
of-the-art classiﬁcation algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we compare
MSSRC with SVM, KNN, and NB. We perform comparison
on two datasets separately.
Performance on PEH dataset. We follow the same exper-
imental procedure in Section VI-C to evaluate the recognition
accuracy of different methods under different d (number of
projections/features). From Figure 12(a), we ﬁnd that KEH-
Gait improves recognition accuracy by up to 7% compared to
the second best classiﬁcation method (i.e., NB). We further
evaluate the recognition accuracy of SVM, KNN and NB by
combining several gait cycles together. As KEH-Gait utilizes
multiple gait cycles to ﬁnd the ﬁnal classiﬁcation result, we
apply the majority voting scheme to achieve a fair comparison.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst obtain the identity of each gait cycle by

using SVM, KNN and NB, then we apply majority voting
scheme to combine the results together, the subject with the
highest voting is declared to be the recognized person. Again,
we set σ = 75% and calculate the recognition accuracy of
different methods by varying k from 1 to 5 (number of gait
cycles). From the results in Figure 12(b), we ﬁnd that KEH-
Gait consistently achieves the best performance and is up to
10% more accurate than the second best approach (i.e., NB).
The improvement of MSSRC over other methods is because
MSSRC exploits the sparsity information from multiple gait
cycles.
Performance on EEH dataset. We perform the same steps
as above on EEH dataset and plot the results in Figure 12(c)
and Figure 12(d). The results show that KEH-Gait is 6% better
than NB when σ = 75%, k = 1, and 4% better than NB when
σ = 75%, k = 5. We also ﬁnd that the overall performance
on EEH dataset is lower than that on PEH dataset. We believe
the drop on recognition accuracy is caused by the fact that the
magnet is not sensitive to slight vibrations and motions.
The results in this section suggest
the proposed
MSSRC in KEH-Gait can improve recognition accuracy signif-
icantly by fusing several steps together and outperform several
state-of-the-art classiﬁcation algorithms. Another straightfor-
ward method to apply SRC on multiple steps is to ﬁrst apply
that
SRC on each step and then obtain the ﬁnal results by major-
ity voting scheme. We found that MSSRC is approximately
3% − 7% more accurate than direct majority voting on our
dataset since it exploits the sparsity information of multiple
measurements. Due to limited space, we do not plot the results
of direct major voting in this paper.
E. Robustness to Gait Variations
To evaluate the robustness of KEH-Gait to gait variations,
we conduct the following two experiments: different day evalu-
ation and different environment evaluation. In this experiment,
same day evaluation means the training set and test set are
chosen from the sessions of the same day while different
days evaluation chooses the sessions from two different days
separated by 1 week. Similarly, in different environment eval-
uations, indoor evaluation means the training set and test set
are chosen from indoor environment while outdoor evaluation
chooses training data and test data from outdoor environment.
We conduct this evaluation on PEH dataset and EEH dataset
respectively. As the results in Figure 13(a) and Figure 13(b),
the accuracy of different day is lower than the same day
evaluation as the different days evaluation tends to produce
more changes to gait. However, KEH-Gait can still achieve
the accuracy of 95% and 89% on the two dataset respectively

This observation holds in
the different environment evaluation. From Figure 13(c) and
Figure 13(d), we can see outdoor environment achieves lower
accuracy than indoor environment because it includes several
different terrains such as grass path and asphalt road. Gait
changes can be caused many other factors such as speed and
shoes etc.. We further discuss the inﬂuence of these factors in
Section VIII-B.
F. Robustness Against Attackers
As mentioned in Section III, we assume the presence of a
passive adversary and an active attacker during an authentica-
tion session. We evaluate the robustness of the proposed system
against the eavesdropper and active attacker by conducting the
following two imposter attempt experiments.
•
•
A passive imposter attempt is an attempt when an
imposter performs authentication using his own walk-
ing pattern. This attack happens when the genuine
user passes his device to another person to spoof the
healthcare system.
An active imposter attempt means the imposter mimics
the gait of the genuine user with the aim to spoof
the healthcare system. This attack happens when the
several users collude to fool the healthcare system.
The ﬁrst experiment is conducted to evaluate the robustness
to a passive imposter. In this experiment, we use the raw
voltage signal from other subjects as passive imposter attempts.
We then repeat this experiment by testing all the steps of
the 20 subjects in the dataset. To evaluate the robustness
against the second imposter attack scenario, we group the 20
subjects into 10 pairs. Each subject was told to mimic his/her
partner’s walking style and try to imitate him or her. Firstly,
one participant of the pair acted as an imposter, the other one as
a genuine user, and then the roles were exchanged. The genders
of the imposter and the user were the same. They observed
the walking style of the target visually, which can be easily
