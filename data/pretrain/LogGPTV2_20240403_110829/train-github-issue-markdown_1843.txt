This may have been filed already, but I did a quick search and couldn't find
it. Please close if that's the the case.
A React component's reusability as a view is highly limited without strong
ties in with CSS. Currently, passing className to a component eg `` does nothing unless explicitly consumed by the the
implementation of `Component`. This requires that each implementation to read
the immutable prop (possibly use the React css addon) to append the class to
the top level DOM or to explicitly set the `style`. As a result, this creates
a lot of code duplication for components that need the flexibility to be used
in multiple contexts.
While, my understanding of the internals may be a bit lacking, I believe that
this feature would mesh well with JSX since `className` and `style` are
already protected keywords. Certainly let me know if I am missing something
obvious as to why this would be a bad feature.
