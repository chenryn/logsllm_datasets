Let us know what functionality you'd like to see in Playwright and what your
use case is.
Let's say I have a page object like the one below
    class PageObject {
      readonly parent: Locator;
      readonly child: Locator;
      constructor(page: Page) {
        this.parent = page.locator('[data-id=parent]');
        this.child = page.locator('[data-id=child]');
      }
    }
It makes sense in my use case to have these as separate locators.  
But in some instances I would essentially want to chain the parent locator to
the child locator.  
I could add another locator `this.parentChild = page.locator('[data-id=parent]
[data-id=child]')` but it seems like duplication of selectors that are already
defined.  
Or I could extract out the selectors but that again is more code.
Some ideas are:
  1. Allow the first arg of page.locator() to be either a `selector: string` OR a `locator: Locator` \--> `this.parent.locator(this.child)`
  2. Be able to get the selector from a `locator` \--> `this.parent.locator(this.child.selector)`
