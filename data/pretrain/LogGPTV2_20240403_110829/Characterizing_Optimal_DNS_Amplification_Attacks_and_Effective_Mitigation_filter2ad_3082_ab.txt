### The Impact of EDNS on DNS Amplification

The use of EDNS (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) can result in larger responses, which may overshadow the size of the OPT record and increase the amplification factor. To quantify this, we measured amplification with and without EDNS enabled, setting the maximum application layer packet size to 4096 bytes as recommended by RFC 6891.

We also issued queries for AAAA records associated with IPv6. However, these were not widely used and did not provide significant amplification compared to other query types. Therefore, we do not discuss AAAA records further.

In summary, we issued the following DNS queries for each domain:
1. A record without EDNS or DNSSEC support.
2. A record with EDNS and DNSSEC support.
3. ANY record without EDNS or DNSSEC support.
4. ANY record with EDNS and DNSSEC support.

These queries were conducted from July 29, 2013, to August 1, 2013. To handle the large number of queries efficiently, we used a dedicated querying process and a separate packet capture process to collect and store the DNS responses. Some packets may have been lost, but for practical reasons, we accepted these losses and did not attempt retransmission. As a result, our reported amplification results are conservative estimates.

### Analysis of Servers and DNS Responses

We analyzed the DNS responses, excluding malformed packets, which constituted 0.07% of the dataset. Table 1 shows the overall success rates of our queries and the degree of amplification for each. We calculated all packet sizes at the application layer, excluding IP and UDP/TCP headers, to focus on DNS.

| Query Type | Record Uses EDNS | Response Rate | Total (MB) | Sent (MB) | Received (MB) | Amplification Ratio (All Queries) | Amplification Ratio (Top 1 million) |
|------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| A          | no               | 90%           | 34          | 485       | 725           | 2.74                             | 14.42                              |
| A          | yes              | 89%           | 44          | 534       | 1,444         | 2.29                             | 16.37                              |
| ANY        | no               | 84%           | 35          | 534       | 1,444         | 6.22                             | 15.32                              |
| ANY        | yes              | 85%           | 44          | 1,444     | 3,277         | 5.03                             | 32.77                              |

Figure 1 shows the distribution of amplification factors for each dataset. For all query types, the attacker receives at least a 129% increase in traffic volume at the application layer using DNS reflection. However, only 0.35% of A record queries and 1.54% of ANY queries had a packet size greater than 512 bytes when EDNS was enabled. This suggests that the overhead of using EDNS reduced the average amplification factor for both A and ANY queries. In general, an attacker does not benefit from using EDNS because few responses need to be shortened to fit within 512 bytes.

### Selective Querying and Amplification

While the overall amplification may be useful for an attacker, focusing on queries and responses that yield the highest amplification can be more effective. Table 1 provides statistics on the top 1 million packets by response size for each dataset. These packets make up roughly 0.3% of each dataset. Although EDNS did not significantly help an attacker sending queries to random domains, it did benefit the attacker who targeted highly amplifying servers. In both groups, EDNS yielded a notable increase in amplification among the largest responses, allowing an attacker to achieve amplification ratios of up to 32.77.

ANY queries provide the best amplification, but they may raise suspicions. An attacker using A record queries can still achieve an amplification factor of 16.37. Anecdotally, during our study involving approximately 1.5 billion DNS queries, our organization was contacted only once by a queried organization. The report indicated that the ANY query received from our querying host might be part of a reflection attack against us. Organizations may start filtering ANY queries to reduce amplification, but the amplification potential of A queries is unlikely to change.

### Theoretical Maximum Amplification

To provide context, we consider the theoretical maximum amplification for DNS with EDNS, using the recommended maximum response size of 4096 bytes. The DNS header is 12 bytes, with an additional n + 5 bytes for a query record (where n is the domain name length), and 11 bytes for the OPT record to enable EDNS. The average maximum amplification with EDNS can be expressed as 4096 / (N + 28), where N is the average domain name length. In our dataset, the average domain name length was 17 characters, yielding a maximum average amplification of approximately 91.02. Our overall amplifications are much lower, indicating that most queried systems do not provide maximum-sized responses. However, the top 10% of amplifying name servers show an amplification of 78.13, suggesting longer domain names and nearly maximum-length responses.

### Distribution of Reflectors

Attackers must ensure they use a large, distributed base of reflectors to avoid bottlenecks and detection. We received responses from 669,090 reflecting name servers, but a smaller pool of servers is responsible for the highest amplifying queries. For the top 1 million A record queries, the number of servers ranges from 24,782 to 24,841. For the top 1 million ANY queries, the number of servers ranges from 22,508 to 28,101. In other words, less than 3.8% of authoritative name servers are associated with the highest degrees of amplification. Figure 2 illustrates the amplification ratios associated with each name server.

### Impact of Record Type on Response Size

Table 2 shows the contributions of each resource record to the typical DNS packet from the top 1 million EDNS groups. Attackers may target record types with the largest payloads. Not all record types are present in each packet. For example, the SOA record typically signals no valid records, and DNSSEC records tend to be large, constituting a majority of the packet size when present.

| Record Type | Packet Bytes (Percent) | Packet Occurrence % |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| A           | 171 (22.13%)            | 87.2%               |
| AAAA        | 115 (7.63%)             | 60.7%               |
| NS          | 158 (19.60%)            | 85.9%               |
| SOA         | 181 (15.76%)            | 12.5%               |
| TXT         | 70 (11.10%)             | 12.5%               |
| All DNSSEC  | 623 (71.3%)             | 40.2%               |
| RRSIG       | 590 (67.5%)             | 40.2%               |
| DNSKEY      | 1,308 (65.2%)           | 40.2%               |
| NSEC3       | 444 (20.8%)             | 11.8%               |

Interestingly, the use of DNSSEC to ensure the authenticity of DNS records has the unintended consequence of improving DNS amplification attacks. As a countermeasure, DNS servers may apply rate-limiting to DNSSEC records. If a server continually asks for a response, the server may stop providing DNSSEC records before cutting off the client entirely, effectively reducing the amplification factor. However, this would limit clients' ability to get authenticated records in cases of high DNS packet loss. Operators should consider these trade-offs.
