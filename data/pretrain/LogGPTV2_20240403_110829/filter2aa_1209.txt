Reliably Prevent Disk Caching
• Use two HTTP headers (not meta tags):
• Pragma: no-cache
– IE 8 and earlier with HTTP/1.0 servers
• Cache-Control: no-store
– All other cases
How to Fail at Preventing Caching
• Cache-Control: no-cache
– Not standard
– Works in IE 4-9
– Broken in IE 10
• Pragma: no-cache
– Only works in IE
• Cache-Control: private
– Not for browsers
• Cache-Control in meta tags
– Not recognized in any browser
• Cache-Control with HTTP/1.0
– Broken in IE 4-8
History of Disk Caching Policies
• Never cache HTTPS
– Netscape 1, 3+
– Mozilla
– Firefox 1, 2
– Safari
• Opt-in
– Firefox 3, 3.5
• Non-standard opt-out
– Netscape 2
– IE 3
• Generous opt-out
– IE 4-8
– IE 9
– IE 10
• Strict standards 
compliance
– Chrome
– Firefox 4+
Misunderstandings of Caching
• Google:
– “browsers do not cache ssl”
– “browsers do not cache https”
Browser Developers
• Favorite quote from Mozilla bug 531801:
I’m on MoCo’s security team :)
Among sites that don’t use cache-control:no-store, 
the correlation between “SSL” and “sensitive” is very 
low.
Recommendations
• Update web standards
• Fix web applications
• Fix bad documentation
• Fix browsers (maybe?)

A History Lesson
• 1995
– Netscape 1 does not disk cache HTTPS 
content
• 1996
– Netscape 2 is opt out:  caches unless Pragma: 
no-cache header or meta tag is set
– IE 3 copies Netscape opt-out behavior
– Netscape 3 reverts, does not cache by default
A History Lesson (cont.)
• 1997
– RFC 2068 introduces Cache-Control header
– IE 4 supports Cache-Control when sent by an 
HTTP/1.1 server
– Cache-Control: no-cache prevents disk caching in IE
– Pragma: no-cache remains supported
• 1998
– Mozilla scraps Netscape code; begins rewrite
– Pragma: no-cache support lost in rewrite
A History Lesson (cont.)
• 2000
– Netscape 6 released, does not cache
– Pragma: no-cache is lost (but no one notices)
– Apache SSL bug workaround introduced; 
breaks Cache-Control support in IE 4-8
• 2003
– Safari released; never caches
A History Lesson (cont.)
• 2008
– Firefox 3 is opt-in:  caches only if Cache-
Control: public is set
– Chrome is opt-out:  caches unless Cache-
Control: no-store is set
– Chrome does not support Pragma: no-cache
• 2010
– Apache trunk patched; Cache-Control breakage 
now restricted to IE 4, 5
A History Lesson (cont.)
• 2011
– Firefox 4 adopts Chrome’s opt-out caching by default
– IE 9 accepts Cache-Control headers over HTTP/1.0
• 2013
– IE 10 caches despite Cache-Control: no-cache
– ISE tests 30 HTTPS sites; 21 fail to set
Cache-Control: no-store on sensitive data
– IE 8 Cache-Control support still broken by Apache 
software in latest CentOS
