### The Future of Business: Balancing Change and Stability

**“Manage up/manage down is the single most dangerous attitude in business. Transparency between leadership and execution teams is vital.”**
— Phil Tee, CEO of Moogsoft

#### Teams and Leadership Misperceptions
Leaders often underestimate the amount of time their teams spend on monitoring. In reality, teams dedicate a significant portion of their time to monitoring, far more than to other tasks such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), support desk/tickets, reducing toil, and quality assurance (QA). This misalignment highlights an optimism bias among leaders, who believe teams are investing in future capabilities, while teams are primarily focused on maintaining current systems.

This disconnect should serve as a wake-up call for leaders. To enable digital transformation and inject capacity into teams, it is crucial to help them find and create more time for experimentation and innovation. Carving out time for these activities is often challenging but essential for long-term success.

#### The Impact of SLAs on Monitoring
The higher the Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements, the more time teams must spend on monitoring. Larger organizations, which typically have higher SLAs, also allocate more time to incident and infrastructure management. These activities, while necessary, do not add direct value to the customer and can be stressful and demotivating. They consume time that could otherwise be invested in DevOps capabilities, leading to better customer experiences through new features and faster platforms.

#### Key Takeaways
- **DevOps Adoption**: The transition from project to product is still ongoing.
- **Monitoring Overload**: Engineering teams are stuck in monitoring cycles, which is neither effective nor enjoyable.
- **Metric Alignment**: Organizations lack the metrics needed to align teams and leaders and provide insights for improvement.
- **Cost of Talent**: Finding and replacing Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and developers with DevOps skills is expensive. Investing in tools that support DevOps principles is a cost-effective alternative.

### Tools and Their Role in Digital Transformation

#### The Evolution of Monitoring Tools
Tools play a critical role in digital transformation, with the internet and software being foundational. Monitoring tools first appeared in the 1990s and have evolved significantly. Today, cloud migration is still in progress, with only about 50% of infrastructure moved to the cloud so far. Cloud promises higher availability through modern distributed architectures and elasticity, making it a prerequisite for many DevOps optimizations.

On average, respondents report using 16 monitoring tools, with some organizations using up to 40. High SLA teams tend to use more tools across various categories, which increases the time spent on monitoring. Leaders may be aware of the number of tools but often underestimate the time required for their management and maintenance.

#### AIOps and Tool Consolidation
AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) is already a key part of the technology stack, with around 80% of respondents using it. However, despite the widespread adoption of monitoring tools, teams still miss SLAs, and customers frequently report issues before the tools detect them.

Only a third of respondents have DevOps toolchain and automation capabilities, though almost everyone wants them. The time spent managing existing investments hinders teams from optimizing for the future. The next phase of cloud and DevOps adoption will likely involve rebalancing monitoring towards AIOps and advanced correlation to ensure proactive management of availability.

#### Key Takeaways
- **Reduce MTTD and MTTR**: Use AIOps to improve customer experience and free up time for improvements.
- **Consolidate Tools**: Reduce the number of monitoring tools to lower license, management, and maintenance costs.
- **Focus on Employee Experience**: Improve organizational performance by focusing on employee experience, which is closely linked to customer experience.

### Our Guidance

#### Improving Availability
Organizations must improve availability, as they frequently miss SLAs and are often alerted to problems by customers. Setting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for availability and staying ahead of customer sentiment are crucial. Availability comes at a high cost, and leaders need to buy back time for their teams to invest in technical stability.

By reducing the time spent on monitoring and incident management, teams can focus more on creating value that improves customer experience, such as new features or platform enhancements. This shift also allows for more time to pay down technical debt, automate toil, and improve employee experience.

#### Steps to Success
1. **Document and Agree on Business Goals**: Align business goals with availability.
2. **Identify and Classify Critical Assets**: Determine and classify business-critical applications, services, and infrastructure.
3. **Discover and Document Tools**: Identify the tools in use, their usage, and associated costs.
4. **Set KPIs, SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs**: Establish and track relevant metrics.
5. **Prioritize and Consolidate Tools**: Focus on the most valuable tools and reduce the footprint.
6. **Adopt AIOps**: Implement AIOps to reduce noise and improve visibility.
7. **Automate and Innovate**: Automate toil, prioritize technical debt, and refocus on innovation.

#### Output and Outcomes
- **Reduced MTTD and MTTR**: Immediate reduction in ticket volume and improved problem detection.
- **Increased System Stability**: Reduction in mean time between incidents and less unplanned work.
- **Improved Customer Satisfaction**: Higher levels of customer satisfaction and DevOps capability adoption.
