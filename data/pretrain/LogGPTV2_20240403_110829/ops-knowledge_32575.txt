User: How to check server load and how to adjust server parameters to improve server performance?
Assistant: 1. Check the server load: You can use the top or htop command to check the server load. These tools can help you understand the real-time status of the server and the resources consumed by the process. Generally speaking, the standard of server load is three indicators: CPU, memory and disk. CPU: If the CPU usage is high, it means that the server's processor is overloaded or the processing program is using a lot of CPU resources. Memory: If the memory capacity of the server is insufficient, the system will write data to the disk swap partition, resulting in performance degradation. Disk: If the disk I/O usage is high, it may cause the disk to be insufficient to support the normal operation of the application. 2. Adjust server parameters to improve performance: Adjusting server parameters usually requires the following steps: - Understanding server hardware and software configuration - Optimizing network and operating system settings - Adjusting process, memory, I/O and other resource limits and settings - Increasing or Reduce the number of threads to match the processor, memory and disk capacity - Configure JVM parameters to improve performance - Adjust configuration and parameters for specific applications For specific operating systems and applications, you can make corresponding adjustments according to actual conditions. For high-load servers, consider increasing the hardware configuration and horizontal expansion of the server.
