In Bootstrap 3.2.0 adding a form-control-feedback icon to a select input
causes the icon to hover over the select's dropdown icon, thus it's not
clickable anymore.
It looks like this:

with the following HTML:
      A label
        Option 1
        Option 2
        Option 3
      A label
          Option 1
          Option 2
          Option 3
The first one is quite easy to fix:
    .form-control + .form-control-feedback {
      right: 12px;
    }
but I haven't found a solution for the latter without using a special class
with selects.

_Edit:_ Fixed validation error below, moved to jsfiddle, Bootply didn't work
anymore.
