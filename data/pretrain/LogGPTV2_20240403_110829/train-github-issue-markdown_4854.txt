# Bug report
## Describe the bug
When the `title` tag is created in a sub-component inside the `Head` tag it
get's set to nothing after the client side bundle takes over. When disabling
the JS in the devtools you can see that when the SSR code is used the `title`
tag is used correctly.
## To Reproduce
Use the code below, load up the index page and you will see the title change
from `My title is set here` to an empty string when the client side bundle
takes over.
    // Pages/index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import Head from "next/head";
    import MetaTags from "./../components/MetaTags";
    export default () => (
    );
    // components/MetaTags.js
    import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
    export default () => (
            My title is set here
    );
## Expected behavior
Expect the client side code to behave like the SSR code when nesting a `title`
tag in the `Head` component.
## Screenshots

## System information

When putting the `title` tag directly in the `Head` component it works as
expected
