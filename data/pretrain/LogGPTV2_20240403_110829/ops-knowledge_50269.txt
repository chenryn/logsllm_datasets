User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why are my deadlocks not shown by SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;? I have a MariaDB (5.5.41) cluster made of 2 nodes configured as master-slave. All reads and writes are sent to the same node.

I have been investigating some deadlock issues for a few weeks.

On a regular basis, my PHP application returns Message: SQLSTATE[40001]: Serialization failure: 1213 Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction.

I used to be able to run SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS; and would see that last deadlock, but for some reason, after a small irrelevant configuration change (changing innodb_buffer_pool_instances from 1 to 19), and a reboot of both nodes, doing a SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS; will not show any deadlock.

However, if I connect with my mysql client and manually create transactions resulting in a deadlock, the status command does show the deadlock.

I tried playing innodb_print_all_deadlocks ON and OFF. Nothing shows in the mysql-error.log, except for my manually triggered deadlock.

Why are the deadlocks created by my PHP application not showing anymore?

Assistant: I don't think I can answer your question directly, given my lack of access to your systems and the information given. However, here are some AWESOME tools I've used to get a better handle on all varieties of MySQL-derived databases I've been charged with administering.

InnoTop:
https://github.com/innotop/innotop

Check out the "D" command in the innotop man page:

       D: InnoDB Deadlocks
           This mode shows the transactions involved in the last InnoDB
           deadlock.  A second table shows the locks each transaction held and
           waited for.  A deadlock is caused by a cycle in the waits-for
           graph, so there should be two locks held and one waited for unless
           the deadlock information is truncated. [...]


The "K" and "L" commands are also potentially relevant to you. 

NOTE: innotop, to be fully useful, may need to change schema information and settings, and add a 'test' database to gather information. READ THE ENTIRE MAN PAGE to know what you are getting into before blindly changing your database. (Personally, I love the extra information the changes innotop unveils...)

Less directly relevant to your lock problem, but very useful, nonetheless:

The Percona Toolkit (formerly MAATKIT):

Good luck!
