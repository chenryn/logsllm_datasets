User: I would like to execute a script work.py in Python, after executing some initialization script init.py.
If I were looking for an interactive session, executing python -i init.py or setting PYTHONSTARTUP=/path/to/init.py would do the trick, but I am looking to execute another script.
Since this is a generic case which occurs often (init.py sets environment and so is the same all of the time), I would highly prefer not referencing init.py from work.py. How could this be done? Would anything change if I needed this from a script instead of from the prompt?
Thank you very much.
Assistant: Python has a special script that is run on startup. On my platform it is located at /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sitecustomize.py IIRC. So, you could either put init.py in that directory alongside a sitecustomize.py script that imports it, or just paste the content of init.py in the sitecustomize.py.
