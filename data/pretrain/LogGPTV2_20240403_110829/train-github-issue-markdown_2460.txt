## ‚Ñπ Computer information
  * PowerToys version: 0.18.1
  * PowerToy Utility: Fancy Zones
  * Running PowerToys as Admin: Yes
  * Windows build number: [run "winver"] 19041.450
## üìù Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Open Fancy Zones > Custom Themes
  2. Add enough custom themes that they no longer fit on your screen
  3. See no Scroll option and delete themes so you can get to the Apply button
### ‚úîÔ∏è Expected result
_What is the expected result of the above steps?_  
Ability to scroll down to Apply
### ‚ùå Actual result
_What is the actual result of the above steps?_  
No way to see Apply without deleting layouts. Apply goes off screen.
  * I move my computer between multiple monitor configurations and locations, and I have layouts for each so having to delete is not ideal.
