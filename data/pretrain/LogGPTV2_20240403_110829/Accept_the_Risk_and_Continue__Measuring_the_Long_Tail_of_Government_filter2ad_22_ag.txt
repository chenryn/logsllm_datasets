### A.2 Case Study 2: Republic of Korea (ROK)

As discussed in Section 6, the Republic of Korea (ROK) exhibits significant differences from the United States, despite both countries having high human development indices and Internet adoption rates. Table A.3 provides a breakdown of South Korean government websites that serve content over HTTP, HTTPS, or both. Additionally, Table A.4 details the reasons for certificate invalidity, with hostname mismatches being the most common issue, indicating potential misconfigurations by system administrators or webmasters.

#### Table A.3: Breakdown of South Korea Datasets

| Dataset               | Total Websites | HTTP Only | HTTP and HTTPS | Valid HTTPS Certs | Invalid HTTPS Certs |
|-----------------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| South Korea Domains Set | 21,818         | 16,814     | 11,685          | 13,768            | 8,542               |

#### Table A.4: Breakdown of South Korean Government Websites by Vulnerability

| Vulnerability                    | Count | % of Total |
|----------------------------------|-------|------------|
| Total Websites Considered        | 21,818 | 100.00%    |
| Content Served on HTTP           | 16,814 | 77.06%     |
| Content Served on HTTPS          | 13,768 | 63.10%     |
| Valid HTTPS Certificates         | 5,226  | 23.95%     |
| Invalid HTTPS Certificates       | 8,542  | 39.15%     |
| Hostname Mismatch                | 2,529  | 11.59%     |
| Unable to Get Local Issuer Cert  | 2,126  | 9.75%      |
| Unknown Exceptions               | 2,903  | 13.30%     |
| Usage of Self-Signed Cert        | 21     | 0.09%      |
| Certificate Expired              | 23     | 0.10%      |
| Self-Signed Cert in Chain        | 818    | 3.75%      |
| Operation Timed Out              | 25     | 0.114%     |
| Connection Refused               | 97     | 0.44%      |

Figure A.3 illustrates the popular CAs issuing EV certificates to South Korean government websites. Notably, Thawte EV RSA CA, the largest EV certificate provider for these sites, has a certificate invalidity rate of ≥95%. The highest number of valid EV certificates for ROK are issued by GeoTrust.

### A.3 Crawler Effectiveness

Figure A.4 demonstrates the effectiveness of our crawler in gathering 134,543 unique government hostnames as described in Section 4.1. The crawler starts with a seed list of websites, visits each root page, and follows links. Only links with valid country codes are further crawled and added to the queue. The crawl is terminated after 7 levels of depth. The red line in the plot shows the percentage increase in the dataset at each level, the pink line represents the number of unique domains filtered at each level compared to the original seed list, and the blue line indicates the number of domains matching the government ccTLDs.

### A.4 Interconnected Governments & MITM Risks

As noted in Section 7.3, our data indicates that 75% of countries (indicated in blue) have links from their government websites to other government websites in at least 7 countries. Many countries (indicated in orange) are linked by government websites of ≥50 countries. This interconnectivity poses a risk for MITM attacks, as a secure HTTPS website might provide links to government websites that support only HTTP. Users navigating to these HTTP sites from a legitimate HTTPS site could be served a MITM version, leading to the risk of receiving false information.

### A.5 Worldwide EV Certificate Usage

Figure A.6 presents the popular EV certificate issuers worldwide and the number of valid certificates provided by these CAs. As indicated in Figure 2 of the paper, the most popular EV certificate-issuing CA ranks 15th among all CAs. The number of invalid certificates used by government websites, due to misconfigurations or expiries, ranges between 15% and 20%, even for EV CAs. This suggests that the paid model of CA-issued certificates does not significantly affect HTTPS validity and supports the move by popular browsers to remove explicit user interfaces that distinguish EV certificates from DV certificates [74].
