A.2 Case Study 2: Republic of Korea (ROK)
As shown in section 6, Republic of Korea (ROK) is very different from the United States despite having a comparably high human development
index score and Internet adoption rate. In Table A.3, we present a breakdown of websites which serve content using http, https and over
both. Similarly, we also provide the detailed breakdown showing the reasons for invalidity in Table A.4. Hostname mismatches continue to
be the most common reasons for certificate invalidity and indicate possible misconfigurations by the system administrators/webmasters
which could be easily corrected.

Table A.3: Breakdown of South Korea Datasets
In Figure A.3, we show popular CAs which issue EV certificates to government websites in South Korea. The largest EV certificate provider
for South Korean government websites, Thawte EV RSA CA, has ≥95% certificate invalidity. The largest number of valid EV certificates for
ROK are issued by GeoTrust.
In Figure 11, we show the popular CAs used by South Korean government websites. The leading CAs for ROK are different from that of
the United States or from a worldwide perspective. Many government websites in ROK continue to use CA authorities which were previously
a part of the NPKI infrastructure and are now considered untrusted by many popular browsers and have been removed from the trust stores.

A.3 Crawler
In Figure A.4, we show the effectiveness of our crawler in gathering the 134,543 unique government hostnames as described in section 4.1.
The crawler is provided with the seed list of websites, visits the root page of each of the website, and uses the follow links present on the
page. Only the links which have a valid country code are chosen to be further crawled and added to the queue of the crawler. We terminate
the crawl after 7 levels of depth. The red line in the plot shows the percent increase in the dataset at each level, the pink line refers to the

domains matching the government ccTLDs.

A.4 Interconnected Governments & MITM Risks
As indicated in section 7.3, our data indicates that 75% of the countries (indicated by blue) have links from their government websites to
other government websites of at least 7 countries. There are many countries (indicated in orange) being linked by government websites of
≥50 countries. A secure https website might provide links on their page to government websites which support only http, posing a risk for
MITM attacks. For example, a user navigating to the http website from the legitimate https website could think that a MITM version of the
http website served to them is legitimate and is at risk of being provided false information.

A.5 Worldwide EV Certificate Usage
In Figure A.6, we present popular EV certificate issuers worldwide and indicate the number of valid certificates provided by these CAs which
continue to be used. As indicated in Figure 2 of the paper, we note that the most popular EV certificate issuing CA is at the 15th most popular
CA. The number of invalid certificates used by the government websites, due to misconfigurations or expiries range between 15% and 20%
even for EV CAs possibly indicating that the paid model of CA issuing certificates does not affect https validity and supports the move by
popular browsers from removing explicit user interfaces which distinguished EV certificates from DV certificates [74].
