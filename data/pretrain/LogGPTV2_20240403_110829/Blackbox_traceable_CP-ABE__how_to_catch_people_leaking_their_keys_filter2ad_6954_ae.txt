iments H2 and H3 with non-negligible advantage.
Proof. The indistinguishability of H2 and H3 can be
proven using a proof similar to that of Lemma 6.3 in [9],
which was used to prove the indistinguishability of similar
hybrid experiments for their Augmented Broadcast Encryp-
tion (AugBE) scheme. For simplicity, we will prove Claim 2
by a reduction from our AugCP-ABE scheme to the AugBE
scheme in [9]. Complete proof will be given in the full pa-
per.
5. POLICY-SPECIFIC DECRYPTION BLACK-
BOX
In previous sections, we considered the traceability against
key-like decryption blackboxes, which allow a seller (on eBay)
to advertise the alleged decryption privilege of a blackbox
D by an attribute set SD. The seller can claim that D can
decrypt a ciphertext (with at least a non-negligible proba-
bility) if the ciphertext access policy A is satisﬁed by SD.
Note that A can be any arbitrary access policy as long as
it can be satisﬁed by SD. This type of decryption black-
boxes are very powerful and therefore, could also be one of
the most crucial issues to solve in practice using a blackbox
tracing algorithm. In this section, we focus our attention on
another interesting scenario which requires us to deal with
another type of decryption blackboxes, which we call it a
policy-speciﬁc decryption blackbox.
Policy-Speciﬁc Decryption Blackbox on Sale. Attempt-
ing to invalidate the possible tracing algorithm (such as the
one we proposed above), a malicious user may build and
sell a decryption blackbox which decrypts ciphertexts with
a speciﬁc access policy only. Such a decryption blackbox,
which we call it a policy-speciﬁc decryption blackbox, has
weaker decryption ability than that of the previous key-like
decryption blackbox, as it decrypts ciphertexts with a spe-
ciﬁc access policy only rather than any arbitrary access pol-
icy as long as it is satisﬁed by a speciﬁc attribute set. In
483practice, a seller or a malicious user may set the price lower
for such a policy-speciﬁc decryption blackbox, and adver-
tises that it can decrypt any ciphertexts associated with ac-
cess policy AD. Below is another scenario, which we call it
“found-in-the-wild”, where policy-speciﬁc decryption black-
boxes may be concerned.
A law enforcement agency gets a warrant to search a sus-
pect’s computer and ﬁnds a decryption blackbox. As the
suspect might try to destroy evidence, the explicit descrip-
tion of the blackbox’s (decryption) ability might be gone,
while the law enforcement agency only has certain clue on
the certain access policy associated to the ciphertexts that
the blackbox can decrypt.
Though the corresponding attribute set is not available
and only a speciﬁc access policy AD is known that the asso-
ciated ciphertexts can be decrypted by a policy-speciﬁc de-
cryption blackbox, interesting, we notice that the AugCP-
ABE scheme in Sec. 4 also implies a fully secure BT-CP-
ABE scheme with (selective) traceability against this policy-
speciﬁc decryption blackbox. On its formal deﬁnition, it is
similar to that of key-like decryption blackbox, with the fol-
lowing diﬀerences:
1. Trace algorithm: The tracing algorithm takes an access
policy AD as input, i.e. TraceD(PP, AD, ǫ) and the rest
is the same as before.
2. GameTR:
In the (Policy-speciﬁc) Decryption Blackbox
Generation phase, the adversary A outputs a decryp-
tion blackbox D associated with an access policy AD
and a non-negligible probability ǫ. A wins GameTR if
(a) Pr[D(Encrypt(PP, M, AD)) = M ] ≥ ǫ, where the
probability is taken over the random choices of
message M and the random coins of D.
(b) KT = ∅, or KT 6⊆ KD,
or (∀kt ∈ KT , Skt does not satisf y AD ).
3. GameIH: We do not need the concept of strictest access
policy here, i.e., in the Challenge phase, A submits a
message M and an access policy A∗, and the challenger
sends CT ← EncryptA(PP, M, A∗, ¯k + b) to A. Here
we have to deﬁne a weaker model of GameIH, where
A is required to declare A∗ before seeing the public
parameter, and the deﬁned index-hiding property is
referred to as selective index-hiding.
4. Similar to Theorem 1, we can show that an AugCP-
ABE with message-hiding and (selective) index-hiding
properties implies a secure and (selectively) traceable
BT-CP-ABE against policy-speciﬁc decryption black-
box.
To prove the message-hiding and index-hiding properties
of the AugCP-ABE scheme under the deﬁnition above for
policy-speciﬁc decryption blackbox, we only need to modify
a few prooﬁng details of Lemma 1, and the proof idea is
similar to the current one for key-like decryption blackbox.
In the proof of Lemma 1 for key-like decryption blackbox,
as the challenge ciphertext is generated using the strictest
access policy of the challenge attribute set S∗, we can have
a guess on a particular attribute ¯x and consequently prove
the index-hiding against adaptive adversaries. However, in
the case of policy-speciﬁc decryption blackbox, the challenge
ciphertext is generated using the challenge access policy A∗,
where it is hard to have a successful guess unless we consider
only the selective adversaries.
In summary, the resulting
BT-CP-ABE scheme is fully secure and selectively traceable
against policy-speciﬁc decryption blackbox.
6. RELATED WORK
Sahai and Waters [22] introduced Attribute-Based En-
cryption (ABE) for addressing the fuzzy identity matching
problem in IBE. Goyal et al. [11] later formalized the notions
of CP-ABE and Key-Policy ABE (KP-ABE). KP-ABE sys-
tems available in the literature include [21, 15, 20, 1], how-
ever, these systems do not address the traceability problem.
Katz and Schr¨oder [14] introduced the notion of traceabil-
ity in the context of predicate encryption [13], where they
proposed a generic construction that adds traceability to any
inner-product predicate encryption (IPE) scheme with the
price of adding overhead linear in K (the number of users)
to the original scheme. Note that although IPE (e.g., the
most expressive schemes to date in [13]) implies IBE, BE
and KP-ABE, it cannot eﬃciently implement the functions
of expressive CP-ABE. The advances of our work is mak-
ing are twofold in the sense that we add traceability (1) to
an existing expressive CP-ABE scheme (2) at the expense of
sub-linear (i.e. √K) overhead, although our result is speciﬁc
rather than generic as [14] is.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a new CP-ABE scheme that si-
multaneously supports fully collusion-resistant (and public)
blackbox traceability and high expressivity (i.e., support-
ing any monotonic access structures), as well as without the
one-use restriction. The scheme is proved secure against
adaptive adversaries in the standard model. For the trace-
ability against key-like decryption blackbox, the scheme is
proved traceable against adaptive adversaries in the stan-
dard model, and for the traceability against policy-speciﬁc
decryption blackbox, the scheme can be proved traceable
against selective adversaries in the standard model. Com-
pared with the most eﬃcient conventional (non-traceable)
CP-ABE schemes currently available with high expressivity
and full security in the standard model, the new CP-ABE
adds fully collusion-resistant (and public) blackbox trace-
ability with the price of adding only O(√K) elements in the
ciphertext and public key.

APPENDIX
A. PROOFS
A.1 Proof of Lemma 1
Proof. Suppose there exists a polynomial time adver-
sary A that breaks the index-hiding game with advantage
ǫ. We build a PPT algorithm B to solve a 3-Party Diﬃe-
Hellman problem instance in a subgroup as follows.
B receives the 3-Party Diﬃe-Hellman challenge in a sub-
group from the challenger as (N, G, GT , e, g, g2, g3, A =
ga, B = gb, C = gc, T ), where G is a bilinear group of order
N = p1p2p3, Gpi is the subgroup of order pi in G (i = 1, 2, 3),
g, g2 and g3 are generators of Gp1 , Gp2 and Gp3 respectively,
and a, b, c are randomly chosen from ZN . B’s goal is to de-
termine T = gabc or T is a random element from Gp1 .
Setup. Firstly, B randomly chooses an attribute ¯x ∈ U to
guess that ¯x will be in the challenge attribute S∗ (regardless
of whether A behaves in Case I or Case II) and will not be
in S(¯i,¯j) if A behaves in Case II. Then B randomly chooses
{αi ∈ ZN}i∈[m], {ri, z′
i ∈ ZN}i∈[m]\{¯i}, {cj ∈ ZN}j∈[m]\{¯j},
{ax ∈ ZN}x∈U \{¯x}, r′
¯i, z¯i, c′
and η, θ ∈ ZN . B gives A the public parameter PP:
(cid:16) g, f = C η, h = gθ, {Ei = e(g, g)αi}i∈[m],
{Gi = gri , Zi = C z′
i}i∈[m]\{¯i}, G¯i = Br′
{Hj = gcj}j∈[m]\{¯j}, H¯j = C c′
{Ux = gax}x∈U \{¯x}, U¯x = C a′
¯i , Z¯i = gz¯i
¯j ,
¯x (cid:17).
¯j , a′
¯x ∈ ZN ,
Note that B implicitly chooses r¯i, c¯j , a¯x ∈ ZN and {zi ∈
ZN}i∈[m]\{¯i} such that
¯i ≡ r¯i mod p1, cc′
br′
i ≡ zi mod p1 ∀i ∈ [m] \ {¯i}.

¯j ≡ c¯j mod p1, ca′
¯x ≡ a¯x mod p1,
