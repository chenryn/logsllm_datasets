### Is Our Ground-Truth for Traffic Classification Reliable?

In our dataset, 14,445 flows (1.14% of all flows) accounting for 0.28 GB (0.78%) of data volume were identified based on the HTTP content-type field extracted from the packets. Consequently, we successfully established ground truth for 535,438 flows (42.43% of all flows), representing 32.61 GB (91.37%) of the total data volume. The remaining flows remain unlabeled due to their short lifetimes (less than approximately 1 second), which prevented the VBS from reliably establishing the corresponding sockets. Only the successfully classified flows will be considered during the evaluation of the classifiers. However, all flows are included in the publicly available traces to ensure data integrity and the proper functioning of the classifiers, which may rely on the coexistence of different flows.

We isolated several application classes based on the information stored in the database, such as application labels and the HTTP content-type field. The classes, along with the number of flows and the data volume, are presented in Table 2. We have published this labeled dataset, including full packet payloads, in [12]. This dataset can serve as a reference benchmark for the research community to validate and compare network traffic classifiers.

## 3. Performance Comparison

This section provides a detailed analysis of the classification results for different types of traffic by each classifier. The results are summarized in Table 3, which presents the ratio of correctly classified flows (precision or true positives), incorrectly classified flows (errors or false positives), and unclassified flows (unknowns). The complete confusion matrix is available in our technical report [15].

### P2P Traffic Classification

#### Edonkey
For the classification of Edonkey traffic, PACE and Libprotoident achieved high precision (over 94%). NDPI and OpenDPI, which use the same pattern, as well as NBAR, could classify almost no Edonkey traffic (precision below 1%). L7-filter classified about one-third of the flows but produced many false positives, classifying over 13% of the flows as Skype, NTP, and finger. Misclassified flows in NDPI were labeled as Skype, RTP, and RTCP, while those in NBAR were labeled as Skype.

#### BitTorrent
None of the classifiers fully succeeded in classifying BitTorrent traffic. PACE and Libprotoident again achieved the highest precision (over 77%). The other classifiers had significant difficulties in identifying this type of traffic. When misclassified, BitTorrent traffic was often labeled as Skype.

### Traditional Applications

#### FTP
FTP traffic was generally correctly classified. Only L7-filter and NBAR had issues, with L7-filter classifying some traffic as SOCKS.

#### DNS
All classifiers could properly classify DNS traffic. Similar results were obtained for NTP, with most classifiers achieving high precision. However, NBAR completely failed to classify NTP traffic.

#### SSH
SSH traffic (Linux version) was classified with high accuracy. NBAR nearly classified all flows, while the other classifiers labeled more than 95% of them correctly.

#### RDP
RDP, commonly used by VoIP applications, was also classified with similar performance. L7-filter and NBAR could not classify this application at all. False positives for L7-filter, Libprotoident, and NBAR were mainly due to Skype, RTMP, and H323, respectively.

### NETBIOS
NETBIOS traffic classification results were quite different. Surprisingly, NBAR and NDPI were the only classifiers that correctly labeled NETBIOS traffic. PACE could classify two-thirds of this traffic, and OpenDPI only one-quarter. L7-filter and Libprotoident did not detect this traffic properly. Misclassified flows in Libprotoident were labeled as RTP and Skype, and in L7-filter as Edonkey, NTP, and RTP.

### RTMP
RTMP traffic, commonly used by browsers and plugins for playing FLASH content, was evaluated. Only Libprotoident has a specific pattern for RTMP. Therefore, RTMP traffic classified as FLASH was also counted as correct, though less precise. L7-filter and NBAR could not classify this traffic. The other classifiers achieved a similar precision of around 80%. NDPI's false positives were due to some traffic being classified as H323, and L7-filter errors were due to traffic being misclassified as Skype and TSP.

### HTTP
All classifiers except L7-filter could properly classify most HTTP traffic. L7-filter labeled all traffic as finger or Skype. NDPI classified some HTTP traffic as iMessage_Facetime. PACE, known for low false positive rates, surprisingly had many errors, with all incorrect classifications labeled as Meebo traffic. The older Meebo pattern in OpenDPI and the newer one in NDPI did not have this issue.

### Sub-classification of HTTP Traffic
Our dataset allows for the study of HTTP traffic at a finer granularity, such as identifying different services running over HTTP. NDPI is the only tool that can sub-classify some applications at this level (e.g., YouTube, Facebook). Newer versions of PACE also provide this feature, but we did not have access to it for this study. Table 4 shows the results for four applications running over HTTP, identified by NDPI. Unlike other tools, NDPI can correctly label these applications with a precision higher than 97%. Misclassifications were caused by traffic labeled as HTTP without providing the lower-level label.

Table 3: DPI Evaluation
| Application | Classifier | % Correct | % Wrong | % Unclassified |
|-------------|------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Edonkey     | Libprotoident | 94.80 | 0.45 | 34.21 |
| ...         | ...        | ...       | ...     | ...            |
| HTTP        | NDPI       | 95.71 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
