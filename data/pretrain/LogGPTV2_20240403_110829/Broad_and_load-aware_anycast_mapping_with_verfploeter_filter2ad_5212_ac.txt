**Table 3: List of anycast sites used in our measurements.**

Our study involves a total of 10 anycast sites, with 5 sites in Europe, 2 in the USA, and 3 other sites spread across Asia, Oceania, and South America, as detailed in Table 3. Tangled, our anycast testbed, allows us to examine the interactions between a larger number of sites and conduct experiments that are not feasible in an operational anycast service. This setup helps us understand anycast instability and the presence of Autonomous Systems (ASes) in multiple catchments (§6).

### Limitations

- **Shared ISP:** Three of the testbed sites share a common Internet Service Provider (ISP), which may influence the overall catchment.
- **Routing via Common Link:** The anycast site in São Paulo routes all its traffic via the same link as the site in Miami, potentially causing announcements from São Paulo to be overshadowed.
- **Connectivity Issues in Japan:** The connectivity at the site in Japan is such that it does not attract much traffic, as announcements from other sites are almost always preferred.

Before conducting the measurements, the connectivity of each site was individually validated by announcing our prefix from that location only. These limitations are not unique to our testbed, as similar issues can be observed in public anycast services [43].

### Dataset

As shown in Table 1, we measured the catchment using both Verfploeter and Atlas on February 1, 2017 (UTC). Additionally, we determined the catchment of Tangled using Verfploeter every 15 minutes over a 24-hour period starting on March 23, 2017, 10:57 UTC, resulting in 96 measurements. In total, we collected 342,604,759 ICMP replies, of which 324,675,876 remained after data cleaning.

For each measurement, we transmitted one ICMP packet to each of the 6.4 million IPs on the hitlist at a rate of 10,000 packets per second to prevent network or equipment overload. Each measurement round took approximately 10.5 minutes to complete. A unique identifier in the ICMP header was used in every measurement round to ensure dataset separation.

### 5. Analysis of the Verfploeter Mechanism

In this section, we evaluate the Verfploeter measurement method. We demonstrate the broader coverage of Verfploeter compared to RIPE Atlas and how catchment mapping from Verfploeter can be combined with historical traffic load to accurately predict load at individual anycast sites.

#### 5.1 Utility: Operational Evaluation of Anycast Catchments

A long-standing goal of anycast mapping is to assess load balancing and routing problems [9, 43]. We examined B-Root's anycast distribution, which has only two sites but was recently deployed in May 2017, allowing us to deploy Verfploeter on it.

We measured the geographic footprint of B-Root using RIPE Atlas (Figure 2a) and Verfploeter (Figure 2b). These maps highlight several important differences:

- **Broader Coverage:** Verfploeter provides good coverage for most of the populated globe, while Atlas coverage is good in Europe and reasonable in North America but sparse elsewhere, especially in China.
- **Denser Observations:** Even where coverage is good, Verfploeter provides far more numerous observations, with the scale of Figure 2b being 1000× greater than Figure 2a.

These differences are particularly important for examining B-Root catchments in South America and China. For example, Verfploeter shows that most of China selects the MIA site, while Atlas cannot provide this information. The denser coverage in South America also highlights the impact of B-Root’s hosting ISPs, such as AMPATH, which is well-connected in Brazil and Argentina but not on the west coast of South America.

Better coverage in locations like East and South Asia, which have many Internet users but few Atlas VPs, is crucial. B-Root’s goal in measuring anycast is to understand routing choices, which we will return to in §6.1.

#### 5.2 Utility in Mapping Multi-Site Anycast

B-Root demonstrates the benefits of increased VP numbers with Verfploeter, but we also want to understand how different approaches work on anycast deployments with more sites. Therefore, we turn to Tangled, our anycast testbed designed and deployed by us (§4.2).

Figure 3 maps the catchments of Tangled with Atlas and Verfploeter. Outside of Europe, the greater density of coverage provided by Verfploeter results in clear qualitative differences. For example, the IAD site (dark yellow) is prominent across North America in Verfploeter but not in Atlas, where CDG and ENS seem to serve that region. We also see very different mixes of sites in Australia, and only Verfploeter provides coverage of China.

The key result is that Verfploeter coverage tracks the Internet as a whole, not just where physical VPs can be placed. We quantify this difference in the next section.

#### 5.3 Greater Coverage in Verfploeter

In §5.1 and §5.2, we showed how the greater coverage in Verfploeter reveals aspects of B-Root and our testbed Tangled that would otherwise be missed. This coverage is possible because Verfploeter’s passive VPs only require a computer that responds to ICMP, rather than physically deployed devices (Figure 1), allowing us to cover millions of /24s.

To quantify the difference in coverage visible in Figure 2, Table 4 compares the number of blocks seen by both measurement approaches. For both systems, some VPs are unavailable: 455 Atlas VPs do not respond, and about 3M Verfploeter ping targets do not reply. All Atlas VPs have geolocation, but we discard a few Verfploeter blocks (678) that we cannot geolocate.

The key result is that Verfploeter sees around 430× more blocks than Atlas. Although Atlas finds a few unique blocks, about 77% of Atlas blocks are also seen by Verfploeter, and Verfploeter sees around 3.61M additional blocks.

#### 5.4 From Observations to Load

Next, we look at how well different measurement systems relate to actual load on an anycast service. It is well known that the distribution of RIPE Atlas reflects more about who RIPE interacts with than global Internet traffic. Our goal is to calibrate different measurement systems to best match actual traffic. We show that, once calibrated, we can get very accurate predictions about expected service load, but the calibration is necessary to account for variation in load per block. Calibrated predictions are important if Verfploeter is to be used for capacity planning.

**Estimating Load:**

To estimate load on B-Root, we begin with our prediction about anycast catchments from Verfploeter, then weight each /24 block by our measurements of its known traffic load (§3.2). Blocks that do not reply to our probes or where the specific address did not reply are mapped to “unknown,” indicating we cannot determine the anycast mapping. We assume their traffic will go to our sites in similar proportion to blocks in known catchments.

Figure 4a shows the result of this load prediction. Comparing this estimate to Figure 2b, which counts /24 blocks that source traffic, and Figure 2a, which counts Atlas VPs, the most striking operational difference is that load seems to concentrate traffic in fewer hotspots. This outcome is not surprising, as DNS is a common service operated by most ISPs with a local recursive resolver. Thus, an ISP with users spread over a large region may still send all DNS traffic through recursive resolvers housed at a few data centers. Weighting coverage by load corrects for these protocol-specific effects not seen directly in our ICMP-based measurements.

Second, Verfploeter can only map blocks that respond to our probes. Table 5 shows coverage as seen from B-Root’s traffic logs, indicating that there are a large number of blocks (about 12.9%) that are not mapped. Figure 4a plots the load from these blocks in red, showing that most are in Korea, with some in Japan and central and southeast Asia. In §5.5, we show that these missing blocks do not alter our predictions.
