niﬁcantly degrading the quality of the audio; and it would
be unforgeable, so that it could not be applied to an un-
protected album without the cooperation of the protec-
tion vendor, even if the adversary had access to protected
discs.
This last requirement stems from the DRM vendor’s
platform building strategy, which tries to put the DRM
software on to as many computers as possible and to have
the software control access to all marked discs.
If the
vendor’s identifying mark is forgeable, then a record la-
bel could mark its discs without the vendor’s permission,
thereby taking advantage of the vendor’s platform with-
out paying.5
The active protection mechanisms employed by XCP and
MediaMax regulate access to raw CD audio, blocking ac-
cess to the audio tracks on albums protected with a par-
ticular scheme while allowing access to all other titles.
5.2 MediaMax Disc Recognition
To ﬁnd out how well the disc recognition mechanisms
employed by CD DRM systems meet
the ideal re-

quirements, we examined the recognition system built
into MediaMax. This system drew our attention be-
cause MediaMax’s creators have touted their advanced
disc identiﬁcation capabilities, including the ability to
identify individual tracks within a compilation as pro-
tected [16]. XCP appears to use a less sophisticated disc
recognition system based on a marker stored in the data
track of protected discs; we did not include it in this
study.
We determined how MediaMax identiﬁes protected al-
bums by tracing the commands sent to the CD drive
with and without the active protection software run-
ning. These experiments took place on a Windows XP
VMWare virtual machine running on top of a Fedora
Linux host system, which we modiﬁed by patching the
kernel IDE-SCSI driver to log all CD device activity.
With this setup we observed that the MediaMax soft-
ware executes a disc recognition procedure immediately
upon the insertion of a CD. The MediaMax driver reads
two sectors of audio at a speciﬁc offset from the begin-
ning of audio tracks—approximately 365 and 366 frames
in (a CD frame stores 1/75 second of sound). On unpro-
tected discs, the software scans through every track in
this way, but on MediaMax-protected albums, it stops af-
ter the ﬁrst three tracks, apparently having detected an
identifying feature. The software decides whether or not
to block read access to the audio solely on the basis of in-
formation in this region, so we inferred that the identify-
ing mechanism takes the form of an inaudible watermark
embedded in this part of the audio stream.6
Locating the watermark amid megabytes of audio
might have been difﬁcult, but we had the advantage of
a virtual Rosetta Stone. The actual Rosetta Stone—a
1500 lb. granite slab, unearthed in Rosetta, Egypt, in
1799—is inscribed with the same text written in three
languages: ancient hieroglyphics, demotic (simpliﬁed)
hieroglyphics, and Greek. Comparing these inscriptions
provided the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphic
texts. Our Rosetta Stone was a single album, Velvet Re-
volver’s Contraband, released in three different versions:
a U.S. release protected by MediaMax, a European re-
lease protected by a passive scheme developed by Macro-
vision, and a Japanese release with no copy protection.
We decoded the MediaMax watermark by examining the
differences between the audio on these three discs. Bi-
nary comparison revealed no differences between the re-
leases from Europe and Japan; however, the MediaMax-
protected U.S. release differed slightly from the other
two in certain parts of the recording. By carefully an-
alyzing these differences—and repeatedly attempting to
create new watermarked discs using the MediaMax ac-
tive protection software as an oracle—we were able to
deduce the structure of the watermark.
The MediaMax watermark is embedded in the audio
of each track in 30 clusters of modiﬁed audio samples.
Each cluster is made up of 288 marked 16-bit audio sam-
ples followed by 104 unaltered samples. Three mark
clusters exactly ﬁt into one 2352-byte CD audio frame.
The watermark is centered at approximately frame 365
of the track; though the detection routine in the software
only reads two frames, the mark extends several frames
to either side of the designated read target to allow for im-
precise seeking in the audio portion of the disc (a typical
shortcoming of inexpensive CD drives). The MediaMax
driver detects the watermark if at least one mark cluster
is present in the region read by the detector.
A sequence of 288 bits that we call the raw watermark
is embedded into the 288 marked audio samples of each
mark cluster. A single bit of the raw watermark is em-
bedded into an unmarked audio sample by setting one
of the three least signiﬁcant bits to the new bit value (as
shown in bold below) and then setting the two other bits
according to this table:7

The position of the embedded bit in each sample fol-
lows a ﬁxed sequence for every mark cluster. Each of
the 288 bits is embedded in the ﬁrst-, second-, or third-
least-signiﬁcant bit position of the sample according to
this sequence:

The active protection software reads the raw water-
mark by reading the ﬁrst, second, or third bit from each
sample according to the sequence above. It determines
whether the resulting 288-bit sequence is a valid water-
mark by checking certain properties of the sequence (rep-
resented below). It requires 96 positions in the sequence
to have a ﬁxed value, either 0 or 1. Another 192 positions
are divided into 32 groups of linked values (denoted a–z

and α–ζ below). In each group, three positions share the
same value and three share the complement value. This
allows the scheme to encode a 32-bit value (value A),
though in the discs we studied it appears to take a differ-
ent random value in each mark cluster of each protected
title. The ﬁnal 32 bits of the raw watermark may have ar-
bitrary values (denoted by below) and encode a second
32-bit value (value B). MediaMax version 5 uses this
value to distinguish between original discs and backup
copies burned through it proprietary player application.

5.3 Attacks on the MediaMax Watermark
The MediaMax watermark fails to satisfy the indelibility
and unforgeability requirements of an ideal disc recogni-
tion system. Far from being indelible, the mark is sur-
prisingly brittle. Most advanced designs for robust au-
dio watermarks [7, 6] manipulate the audio in the fre-
quency domain and try to resist removal attempts that use
lossy compression, multiple conversions between digital
and analog formats, and other common transformations.
In contrast, the MediaMax watermark is applied in the
time domain and is rendered undetectable by even minor
changes to the ﬁle. An adversary without any knowledge
of the watermark’s design could remove it by converting
the tracks to a lossy format like MP3 and then burning
them back to a CD, which can be accomplished easily
with standard consumer applications. This would result
in some minor loss of ﬁdelity, but a more sophisticated
adversary could prevent the mark from being detected
with almost no degradation by ﬂipping the least signiﬁ-
cant bit of one carefully chosen sample from each of the
30 watermark clusters, thereby preventing the mark from
exhibiting the pattern required by the detector.
The watermark also fails to satisfy the unforgeability
requirement. The mark’s only defense against forgery is
its complicated, unpublished design, but as is often the
case this security by obscurity has proved tedious rather
than impossible to defeat. As it turns out, an adversary
needs only limited knowledge of the watermark—its lo-
cation within a protected track and its conﬁnement to
the three least signiﬁcant bits of each sample—to forge
it with minimal loss of ﬁdelity. Such an attacker could
transplant the three least signiﬁcant bits of each sample
within the watermarked region of a protected track to the
corresponding sample from an unprotected one. Trans-
planting these bits would cause distortion more audible
that that caused by embedding the watermark since the
copied bits are likely to differ by a greater amount from
the original sample values; however, the damage to the
audio quality would be limited since the marked region
is only 0.4 seconds in duration. A more sophisticated ad-
versary could apply a watermark to an unprotected track
by deducing the full details of the structure of the water-
mark, as we did; she could then embed the mark in an
arbitrary audio ﬁle just as well a licensed disc producer.
Though MediaMax did not do so, it is straightforward
to create an unforgeable mark using digital signatures.
The marking algorithm would extract a segment of music,
compute its cryptographic hash, digitally sign the hash,
and write the hash into the low-order bits of audio sam-
ples elsewhere in the music ﬁle. The recognition algo-
rithm would recompute the hash, and extract and verify
the signature. Though unforgeable, this mark would be
no more indelible than the MediaMax scheme—making
an indelible mark is a more difﬁcult problem.
6 CD DRM Players
Increasingly, personal computers—and portable play-
back devices that attach to them—are users’ primary
means of organizing, transporting, and enjoying their mu-
sic collections. Sony-BMG and its DRM vendors recog-
nized this trend when they designed their copy protec-
tion technologies. Rather than inhibit all use with PCs,
as some earlier anti-copying schemes did [10], XCP and
MediaMax provide their own proprietary media players,
shipped on each protected CD, that allow certain limited
uses of the music subject to restrictions imposed by the
copyright holder.8
The XCP and MediaMax players launch automatically
using autorun when a protected disc is inserted into a PC.
Both players have similar feature sets. They provide a
rudimentary playback interface, allowing users to listen
to protected albums, and they allow access to “bonus con-
tent,” such as album art, liner notes, song lyrics, and links
to artist web sites. The players access music on the disc,
despite the active protection, by using a special back door
interface provided by the active protection software.
XCP and MediaMax version 5 both permit users to
burn copies of the entire album a limited number of times
(typically three). These copies are created using a propri-
etary burning application integrated into the player. The
copies include the player applications and the same ac-
tive (and passive, for XCP) protection as the original al-

of copying.
