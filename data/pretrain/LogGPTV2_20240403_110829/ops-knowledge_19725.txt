User: how do i use python for a Spark program in eclipse?
I've installed PyDev plugin in eclipse and installed Python on the system but how do i use PySpark.
Assistant: I started a new Python project in PyDev, then went into Project -> Properties -> PyDev - PYTHONPATH -> External libraries. I added a "source path" entry for 

/path/to/spark/spark-0.9.1/python

This allowed PyDev to see all Spark-related code and provide auto complete, etc.
Hope this helps.
