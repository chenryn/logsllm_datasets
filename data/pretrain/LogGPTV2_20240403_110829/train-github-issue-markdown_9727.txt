In several recent runs, the following issues have been observed:

- [Run 1](https://k8s-gubernator.appspot.com/build/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/pull/28543/kubernetes-pull-build-test-e2e-gce/48158/)
- [Run 2](https://k8s-gubernator.appspot.com/build/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/pull/26696/kubernetes-pull-build-test-e2e-gce/48157/)
- [Run 3](https://k8s-gubernator.appspot.com/build/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/pull/27243/kubernetes-pull-build-test-e2e-gce/48156/)

During these runs, the system attempted to wait for up to 300 seconds for cluster initialization. This process continuously checks whether the Kubernetes API is reachable. If an uncaught error occurs during startup, this step may time out.

In each of the mentioned runs, the cluster failed to initialize within the 300-second window. The specific error messages are as follows:

```
2016/07/07 15:09:32 e2e.go:218: Error running up: exit status 2
2016/07/07 15:09:32 e2e.go:214: Step 'up' finished in 7m56.450395031s
2016/07/07 15:09:32 e2e.go:114: Error starting e2e cluster. Aborting.
exit status 1
```

These errors indicate that the cluster did not initialize successfully, and the end-to-end (e2e) tests were aborted.
