  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I expect that in the handler for the `Router.onRouteChangeComplete` event,
`document.title` would be the title of the new page that was navigated to.
## Current Behavior
`document.title` is still the title of the previous page
`onRouteChangeComplete`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Example: https://create-next-example-app-qyxwpdeqzb.now.sh/
Please note that the pages here are wrapped with the following layout
component:
    import React, { Component } from "react";
    import Router from 'next/router';
    import Head from "../components/head";
    class Page extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { title: null };
      }
      componentDidMount() {
        Router.onRouteChangeComplete = (data) => {
          this.setState({ title: document.title });
        };
      }
      render() {
        return 
          Page title (this.props.title): {this.props.title}
          Page title (onRouteChangeComplete): {this.state.title}
          {this.props.children}
      }
    }
    export default Page;
## Context
I have been trying to add tracking analytics in `onRouteChangeComplete`, but
because the title is inaccurate, my analytics are incorrect.
