This is a request to add a model viewer example.  
I think it's a very common need to display a model, pan, rotate and zoom.
Features:
  * Load models of different formats with plugable loaders. It can help unify the loaders API if needed.
  * Auto zoom the model to a reasonable initial value. Allow zoom in/out.
  * Use TrackballControls to rotate the model.
  * Allow pan.
This example can be used as a base for many other examples.  
For example, for showing different loaders and controls.
Thigiview is very nice but it uses an old version of three.js
