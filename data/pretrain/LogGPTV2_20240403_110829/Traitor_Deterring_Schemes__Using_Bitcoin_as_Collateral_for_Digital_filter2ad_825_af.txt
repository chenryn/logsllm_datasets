service. In regular intervals the SP checks the public ledger
to see whether any active account has an outgoing transac-
tion (no matter to who is transferred).
If there is such a
case the subscription of the user should be cancelled (this
would require the revocation of the key ski an issue that we
do not explicitly deal here but can be handled generically
via e.g., a re-key operation where the SP at regular intervals
refreshes the keys of the system keeping the same collaterals
for all the remaining subscribers). Observe that due to the
properties of TDS for as long as the user respects the service
agreement and does not share her secret-key her collateral
bitcoin remain safe. The user can collect her collateral bit-
coin whenever she wants to terminate the service.
7. CONCLUSION AND OPEN PROBLEMS
We formalize and construct the new cryptographic prim-
itive of TDS that achieves proactive deterrence of unautho-
rized device distribution and we show how bitcoin can be
used as a collateral for a TDS deployment.We also revisit
the open problem of digital signets and reformulate as TDS
in the known ciphertext model, and show how we can uti-
lize TDS to solve it under parameter choices that allow a
possibility result.
There are many interesting open problems that remain.
The ﬁrst one is how to construct a TDS with constant size
ciphertext under standard assumptions. This may require a
fuzzy locker for, e.g., Tardos code [31] which currently uses a
secret tracing algorithm. Also, a construction of unbounded
collusion secure CPE is another alternative which will be of
independent interest. Furthermore, combining a TDS with
a revocation system as in [27] to obtain a “Trace Deterring
and Revoke scheme” would be an important advance.

APPENDIX
A. SOME OMITTED PROOFS
Proof of corollary 4.5. We ﬁrst analyze the parameters
of the instantiation of CPE in section 4.2.
For the parallel repetition construction, as every secret
key is generated from a diﬀerent master secret key, and the
ciphertext CT = {CTi}, and CTi = OneFE.Enc(mpki, m)
for the same message m. It is obvious that due to the secu-
rity of the underlying 1-query secure FE, every ciphertext
is simulatable given C(m) by running the corresponding 1-
query secure FE simulator.
Next, we will analyze the optimized q-query secure FE.
Following the analysis of [15], the only diﬀerence of our
scheme is that we use a c-query secure FE as the build-
ing block. We replace the ﬁrst restriction to be | ∪i1,...,ic
Γij )| ≤ d, as each instance now can assure security
(∩ic
given that the for less than d instances, the collusion of t
users have c keys.
ij =i1
Now we can analyze that this condition will improve the
size of N . To be more speciﬁc, suppose Xij denotes the ex-
pected size of the intersection of two random subsets Xi, Xj,
E(Xij|Xi = X) Pr[Xi = X] = E(Xij|Xi = X).
(cid:88)
E(Xij) =
X
To see this, for any X with size dD + 1, the expected value
E(Xij|Xi = X) is the same and the conditional distribution
follows the hypergeometric distribution with dD + 1 good
balls and tD +1 draws, thus E(Xij|Xi = X) = (tD +1)2/N .
For Xijk denoting the expected size of intersection of three
random subsets Xi, Xj, Xk, we have:
(cid:88)

E(Xijk) =

Pr[Xij = i]E(Xijk|Xij = i)

.
The expected size Ec of the disjoint of all possible inter-
Γij )| (we denote as γ)
Similarly, we can generalize the second formula to the ex-
pected size of intersection of c random subsets which is
(tD + 1)c/N c−1.
section of c subsets: | ∪i1,...,ic (∩ic
is the summation of all combinations of Xi1,...,ic , i.e.,
Ec = q(q−1) . . . (q−c+1)·(dD+1)c/N c+1 ≤ (2qdD)c/N c−1.
If we let Ec ≤ d
2 , i.e. let N = 4d(Dq)1+e, where e = 1 + 1/c,
then following the Chernoﬀ bound: for any δ > 0, Pr[X >
(1 + δ)E[X]] ≤ e
−δ2
2+δ E[X], thus:
ij =i1
Pr[γ ≥ t] = Pr[γ ≥ (1 + 1)Ec] ≤ e

While we are focusing on comparison predicate, which can
be easily implemented e.g., for two numbers x, v represented
using bits x1 . . . x(cid:96), v1 . . . v(cid:96), the comparison predicate [x ≤
v] ⇐⇒ [x = v] ∨ [x1 = 0 ∧ v1 = 1] ∨ [(x1 = v1) ∧ (x2 =
0 ∧ v2 = 1)] ∨ . . . ∨ [(x1 . . . x(cid:96)−1 = v1 . . . v(cid:96)−1) ∧ x = v], is
with degree at most (cid:96) = O(λ).
Summarizing the above analysis, if we set d = λ, N =
Γij )| ≥ d] ≤
O(q1+epoly(λ)), we have Pr[| ∪i1,...,ic (∩ic
e−λ/6 = negl(λ). Then following the analysis of [15], all the
ciphertexts can be simulated.
The ciphertext eﬃciency of the optimized scheme is that
O(N · S · τ ) = O(q3+e · poly(λ)), where N, S are the num-
ber of ciphertext and plaintext elements in each ciphertext
respectively, and τ is the size of ciphertext for each plain-
text element of the underlying succinct c−bound FE, for
c = poly(λ), arbitrary polynomially bounded integer.
tion is simply with ciphertext eﬃciency O(n · poly(λ)).
On the other hand, the parallel repetition based construc-
ij =i1
As the succinct 1-query secure FE can be constructed
assuming succinct fully homomorphic encryption and at-
tribute based encryption for circuit, and the following two
can be based on LWE assumption. Then following theorem
4.1, we can conclude as in the corollary.
Deﬁnition A.1 [1,7] For a subset V randomly chosen from
a universe U , the approximate membership testing problem
with a false positive probability η is to produce a data struc-
ture T such that, for a random element x ∈ U , if x ∈ V ,
T (x) always outputs 1, while if x (cid:54)∈ V , T (x) outputs 0 with
probability at least 1−η (i.e., it may output 1 with probability
at most η, a false positive).
Lemma A.2 [28]. For a universe U with size u, and V ⊂
U with size v, and v (cid:28) u, using space τ , the false positive η
in the AMT problem satisﬁes 2τ ≤ (2η)v.
Proof of proposition 5.2. We will show an attack that
uses up to Ω(k·log2 λ) space can defeat the black-box traitor
deterring if the privacy of the user data is also required.
The adversary selects a set k of distinct plaintexts S =
{m1, . . . , mk} and submits this as a distribution Pk. The
adversary furthermore corrupts user i and receives the cor-
responding set of ciphertexts S = {c1, . . . , ck}. A creates a
membership tester T with a false positive probability  for
S, such that T can be constructed using space O(k log 1
 ).
Using Bloom ﬁlters, [1, 28], if A uses space Θ(k log2 λ), then
 will be a negligible function in λ. A produces a pirate box
B with T built in, and when is given input c, B ﬁrst checks
whether c ∈ S (besides the storage, this checking program
has only a constant description). Assuming the test passes,
the algorithm applies the key ski to decrypt the ciphertext.
Assume there is a black-box recovering algorithm recov-
ers user i’s secret information when given oracle access to B,
and another adversary corrupts a diﬀerent user j and build
a similar box B(cid:48) s.t., it is the same as B only when inputs
passes the tester, B(cid:48) uses skj to decrypt the query and re-
spond. It is obvious that the input/output distribution of
B, B(cid:48) is statistically close (with the only diﬀerence because
of the negligibly small false positive), these two boxes can-
not be distinguished by any algorithm via only oracle access
to them. Thus the Rec algorithm will also return the same
output, i.e., secret information of user i when having oracle
access to B(cid:48), hence contradicting the privacy property.
