privacy addresses may, in a sense, be over-represented; while an autoconﬁgued address
is ﬁxed, a privacy address is periodically regenerated. We also show results for random
addresses, which would have been classiﬁed as privacy addresses except the 6th bit was
set. We see a tiny number of these random addresses. This indicates that the classiﬁca-
tion of address as as a privacy address is unlikely to include many false positives. When
we inspect the random addresses, we see mostly random patterns and a few regular
patterns that have been incorrectly matched.

Some addresses look autoconﬁgured but do not have the global bit set to a value
we expected based on vendor-assigned MAC address. These may be generated from
manually-assigned MAC addresses, may be soft MAC addresses on virtual machines,
or may be manually-assigned host IDs. The data showed no addresses generated from
the MAC range used by VRRP/CARP. We do ﬁnd some addresses corresponding to
autoconﬁguration from the MAC broadcast address. This host ID may be the result of
a failed Ethernet EPROM/faulty driver combined with autoconﬁguration.
A small, but increasing, amount of ISATAP activity is visible. By comparing with
Fig. 4(a) we see that by the end of our data the populations of 6to4, Teredo and ISATAP
clients are roughly in a ratio of 30%:10%:0.3%.
4.2 IE IPv6-Enabled Nameserver
We now consider the data described in Section 3.2. Fig. 6 shows the results for the two
months of data as log-scale bar charts. Activity is quite consistent over the two months.
It is important to note that for a DNS query to be logged, there is no need for a TCP
handshake to complete, and so there is no check for return routability. Thus, about 0.5%
of queries come from 6bone preﬁxes and a handful of requests come from unassigned
(2000:1::1), ULA ([6]) and documentation [9] addresses.

Fig. 6. Results for IEDR name server (log scale), April and May 2007
For comparison, Fig. 7 shows the corresponding results for ftp.heanet.ie. We
expect a contrast between the client populations of these servers, because clients of
mirror servers should not have much in common with recursive DNS servers. Indeed,
when compared to ftp.heanet.ie, ns6.iedr.ie sees fewer requests from pri-
vacy, Teredo and ISATAP addresses. Even the proportion of 6to4 addresses is lower.
The geographic distribution of the addresses also seems more even. We also see an in-
crease in wordy and low addressing. This suggests that administrators shy away from
transition mechanisms for recursive resolvers and opt for manually-assigned addresses.
4.3 Traceroute Data
Now consider the addresses observed in tracerouting across the IPv6 network from
a commercial ISP, an NREN (HEAnet) and from a 6to4 network. Fig. 8 shows the
