### Network Block Device Performance
Each query is treated as a request for a random block, irrespective of sequentiality. For the network block device, the overall query throughput increases but eventually plateaus as larger ranges consume the available bandwidth.

### File Server Workload
To evaluate rORAM in real-world applications, we utilized the file server workload from FileBench. This workload generates accesses similar to those in a regular file system and closely mirrors the SPECFsfs benchmark suite [7]. Specifically, it generates read and write requests for files of various sizes while also updating corresponding metadata. rORAM handles variable-sized accesses efficiently, demonstrating a 5x increase in overall throughput compared to Path ORAM for local HDDs (Figure 7(b)). Similar performance trends are observed for both SSD and network device scenarios (Figure 7(b,c)).

### Video Server Workload
A more suitable benchmark for range ORAM applications is a video server that deploys multiple threads to fetch large sequential chunks of streaming data. In this scenario, large sequential requests can be executed as range queries. Additionally, the application performs writes of variable sizes to metadata and inactive video files. A naive solution of storing and accessing files in large sequential chunks, to minimize seeks, would waste significant I/O when updating small metadata. Since rORAM supports range queries of arbitrary sizes, it handles variable-sized sequential accesses effectively. Consequently, rORAM achieves an 11x increase in query throughput over Path ORAM for local HDDs (Figure 7(a)), an 8x increase for SSDs (Figure 7(b)), and a 4x increase for network devices (Figure 7(c)).

### Client-Side Storage Requirements
For the storage configurations used in our experiments, rORAM requires (in the worst case) approximately 8GB of client-side stash when \( L = 2^{14} \) blocks (combined stash size for all 15 sub-ORAMs) and 128MB when \( L = 2^8 \) blocks (Section VI). The stash size depends only on \( L \) and is independent of the total outsourced storage size. Empirical observations show that, in practice, a smaller stash size may suffice. For example, in our experiments, the maximum observed stash occupancy was around \( 2^{14} \) blocks (64MB) and \( 2^{10} \) blocks (4MB) for \( L = 2^{14} \) and \( L = 2^8 \) blocks, respectively.

### System Tweaks and Optimizations
The Range ORAM construction is designed primarily to minimize the number of disk seeks per operation in the general setting of client/server ORAMs with limited client storage. In practice, several other parameters or settings can be adjusted to further improve performance. In this section, we briefly outline a few of these modifications and optimizations.

#### Parallel Seeks with Multiple Heads or Disks
Modern storage systems often have multiple read/write heads (a high-capacity HDD can have up to 8) or use arrays of high-capacity disks that may be striped (e.g., using RAID). Such configurations, where seeks can occur in parallel, can significantly enhance performance. rORAM can leverage these setups with minimal modifications.

Assume the serverâ€™s storage is partitioned into \( k \) equal-sized parts (disk platters or cluster nodes), and each part can be read or written separately in parallel. It can be shown that the number of parallel seeks per access is \( O\left(\log N \cdot \left(1 + \frac{\log N}{k}\right)\right) \). This means perfect parallel speedup in the number of seeks is possible for \( k \leq \log N \).
