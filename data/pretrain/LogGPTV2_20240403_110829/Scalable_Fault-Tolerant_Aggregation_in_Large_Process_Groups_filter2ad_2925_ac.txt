not masked from the network message loss rate. 
Another scheme elects a committee of I(’  (instead ofjust 
one) leaders in  each  protocol  phase  (conceptually, at each 
internal tree node). Such a scheme is (K’- 1)-fault-tolerant 
at each subtree root.  This may  appear to be sufficient, but 
phase i requires that knowledge of each height-(i - 1) sub- 
tree’s  leader  committee be  disseminated  among all  mem- 
bers  of  its  sibling  height-(i  - 1) subtrees  -  this  typically 
takes at least O(logN) time because of the constant mem- 
ber bandwidth constraint.  Thus, K’  needs to be  O(logN) 
to survive the possibility of all the leaders in the committee 
failing before the dissemination completes. Such a dissemi- 
nation can be avoided by  having views consistent and com- 
plete at all members, but  this  approach requires the use  of 
accurate failure detectors. 
In conclusion. using leader election appears to be either 
inadequate or require unrealistic assumptions for a one-shot 
global aggregation algorithm using the Grid Box hierarchy. 
Random message delivery failures and process crashes can 
arbitrarily affect the completeness of the aggregate value. 
6.3. The Gossiping Approach 
In this section, we present an algorithm for evaluating  a 
composable global aggregate function over member votes. 
This  algorithm  uses  the  Grid  Box  Hierarchy,  but  avoids 
leader election.  We present a discussion and analysis of the 
algorithm, showing that it is only poly-logarithmically sub- 
optimal in time and message complexity.  We  then present 
simulation  results  in  Section  7  to  evaluate  the  resilience 
of  the completeness of  the protocol  to message losses and 
member failures. 
Informally,  the  algorithm  at  each  member consists  of 
l o g ~ N  phases, phase i calculating  the aggregate function 
for the set of  votes  in  the  subtree  of height i (in  the  Grid 
Box Hierarchy) that the member belongs to.  As discussed 
in Section 6.1, in each of  subtree of  each phase, the  com- 
ponent votes  of child members (phase  1) or aggregates of 
child  subtrees  (higher phases)  are  required  for  this  calcu- 
lation.  These component aggregates  or votes are obtained 
by  gossiping rather  than  by  electing  a  leader  and sending 
votes to it. Gossiping lends itself to robustness against ran- 
dom message and process failures, while scaling very well 
with group size. Our algorithm inherits these characteristics 
- its completeness characteristics scale well with increasing 
group size, while the time and message complexity are only 
poly..logarithmically sub-optimal for any group size. 
Our  scheme  does  not  require  complete  or  consistent 
views at any group member - however, we will assume these 
in or’der to simplify the analysis. 
The  algorithm  is  started  simultaneously  at  each  group 
member.  Each group member Ai;  executes  the  following 
three steps in different protocol phases: 
I. Phiase 1: (a) AI;  starts o h  in phase i  = 1, where it gos- 
sips, within  its own grid box, about individual  votes that it 
knows of and that belong to members in  its own grid box - 
this of course includes AI;’s  own vote.  AI;  does so by  pe- 
riodically  (once every gossip roirnd) l )  randomly selecting 
a few gossipees only from among other members in its own 
grid box, and 2 )  sending (gossiping to) them one randomly 
selected known vote along with the identifier of the member 
whose vote it  is.  In  turn, Ai,  knows about  the  vote of an- 
other member in its own  grid box when it first receives the 
same by a gossip message from another member. 
(b) After KlogN  gossip rounds, AI;  applies the aggregate 
funci:ion to the known votes of members in its grid box, and 
bumps itself  up to phase 2. 
11. Phase i (2 5 i  5 10gh-N - 1): (a) In every gossip round 
in phase i, Ai; chooses a few gossipees randomly from the 
set of all members in the same subtree of height i as itself, 
i.e., the set of members whose grid box addresses agree with 
AI,’:;  in the most significant  (logKN - i) digits.  AIj  then 
sends these gossipees a randomly selected aggregate value 
from  among the known  (at AI,)  aggregates for the  height- 
(i - 1) child  subtrees of  AI,’s  height-i  subtree.  Note that 
there  can be at most I 1 at a member M j ,  after 
KlogN  gossip rounds  of  the  above protocol, each of  the 
height-(i - 1) child subtrees’ aggregate values is received 
(via gossip) at M j  with  a probability  C,(N, K ,  b) that can 
be bounded from below from ( I )  as: 
This analysis of course does not apply to the first phase 
of the protocol since a grid box can have anywhere between 
0 and N members, and that many values have to be gossiped 
about during the first phase.  However, we can express the 
expected completeness of  the  first  phase  in  any  grid  box 
from (1) as: C1 ( N ,  K ,  b) = 
1 
1 +i.e.  - K  b  IoqN 
Evaluating C1 ( N ,  K ,  b) exactly is beyond the scope of this 
paper.  Instead, here, we will use a pragmatic approach that 
combines simulation and reasoning to bound the complete- 
ness of our protocol’s first phase. 
Figure 4 shows that at K  = 2  and  b  = 4,  -log(l  - 
C1(N, K ,  b ) )   varies  linearly  with  log(N) (since  both

axes  are  logarithmic).  From  this  curve,  we  obtain  that 
C1(N, K  = 2, b = 4) 2 1 - h, which is a very pessimistic 
lower  bound.  Further,  C I ( N ,  K ,  b) is  monotonically  in- 
creasing with both b and K .  The former is verified by  ob- 
servation.  Figure 5 shows the  variation  of  (1 - C l ( N  = 
2000, I(, 6 = 4))] with K ,  both axes being logarithmic. Ev- 
idently, the completeness is monotonically increasing with 
K .  The same trend was also observed for other values of N 
and b. Thus,

first phase in  any grid  box with an average of K  members 
can be lower bounded by  [l - &I.

completeness of the Hierarchical Gossiping protocol can be 
lower bounded by  [l - &].

This is indeed a satisfactory, although pessimistic, lower 
bound on the protocol’s completeness, for very reasonable 
assumptions on the protocol parameters ( K ,  b).  However, 
this analysis does not reflect the effect of members execut- 
ing protocol phases asynchronously, or of having b < 4 (i.e.,
