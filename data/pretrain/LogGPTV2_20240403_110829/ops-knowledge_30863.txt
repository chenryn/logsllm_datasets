User: I am trying to download some files via mechanize. Files smaller than 1GB are downloaded without causing any trouble. However, if a file is bigger than 1GB the script runs out of memory: 
The mechanize_response.py script throws out of memory at the following line
self.__cache.write(self.wrapped.read())
__cache is a cStringIO.StringIO, It seems that it can not handle more than 1GB.
How to download files larger than 1GB?
Thanks
Assistant: It sounds like you are trying to download the file into memory but you don't have enough.  Try using the retrieve method with a file name to stream the downloaded file to disc.
