memory  system  is  able  to  combine  the  low  latency  benefit  of 
DRAM  and  high  capacity  benefits  of  PCM.  In  addition,  [29] 
proposes  morphable  memory  system  that  dynamically  regulates 
the number of bits per cell in memory system depending on the 
workload  requirement  for  performance  enhancement,  while  our 
schemes focus on the reliability. [27] proposes and evaluates an 
adaptive bit flip technique to enhance write performance, energy 
and endurance. Although PCM can increase memory capacity in 
a  cost-effective  and  power-efficient  manner, 
limited 
endurance  imposes  a  constraint  on  the  lifespan  of  PCM-based 
memory.  [14]  investigates  a  3D  die-stacked  PCM  memory  with 
architectural-  and  OS-  support.  To  maximize  PCM  lifespan,  [4] 
presents  a  set  of  techniques  to  extend  the  lifetime  of  PCM 
memory,  such  as  redundant  bit-write  removal,  row  shifting  and 
segment  swapping.  Furthermore,  [3]  proposes  a  simple  and 
effective  wear-leveling  technique  that  uses  only  two  registers 
rather than a large storage in conventional wear-leveling schemes 
to  minimize  the  area  and  latency  overhead.  In  addition,  [26] 
characterizes  the  impact  of  process  variation  on  PCM  systems 
and  proposes  several  techniques  to  mitigate  the  deleterious 
impact of process variation for PCM in the upcoming nano-scale 
processing technology era. Our study differs from these work in 
that we focus on multi-level cell PCM and investigate the impact 
of  its  drift  phenomena  on  the  readout  reliability.  To  our 
knowledge,  this  is  the  first  work  that  addresses  the  PCM 
resistance drift reliability using holistic approaches.

CONCLUSIONS 
The multi-level cell capability of PCM allows it to be well 
suited for designing high-density memory and disk cache systems. 
One  of  the  main  challenges  in  MLC-PCM  systems  is  read 
reliability  degradation  due  to  resistance  drift.  In  this  study,  we 
characterize the impact of resistance drift on MLC-PCM readout 
error rate in a MLC-PCM/DRAM hybrid memory and show that 
drift can cause a serve reliability issue. A conservative approach 
to  tolerate  drift  and  meet  the  reliability  target  is  to  enlarge  the 
margin between adjacent states. However, such a naïve approach 
can  cause  up  to  2.3X  power  overhead  and  reduce  the  effective 
lifetime  of  a  PCM  system  by  up  to  100X.  We  propose  data 
inversion and rotation, hybrid SLC/MLC design and temperature-
aware  page  allocation  schemes  that  can  effectively  improve  the 
drift tolerance, so that design with smaller margins are sufficient 
to satisfy the reliability requirements in a power- and endurance- 
efficient  manner.  Our  experimental  results  show 
the 
aggregated  effect  of  the  proposed  mechanism  has  the  capability 
of  reducing  the  error  rate  by  an  average  of  87%  and  the  lower 
error  rate  allows  an  up  to  3%  performance  improvement.  For  a 
given reliability target (i.e. lower than 1% error rate in our study), 
using  the  smaller  margin  that  is  enabled  by  our  proposed 
mechanisms  achieves  28%  power  savings  and  15X  endurance 
enhancement with respect to that of simply enlarging the margin. 
Although we focus on MLC-PCM based hybrid memory design 
in this work, the issue of resistance drift remains for MLC-PCM 
based  disk  cache  design,  to  which  our  proposed  techniques  can 
also be applied.
