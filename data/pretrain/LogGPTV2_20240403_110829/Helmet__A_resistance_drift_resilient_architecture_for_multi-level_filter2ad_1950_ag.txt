### VII. Related Work

Recently, there has been increasing interest in exploring phase change memory (PCM) in computer memory system design [1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 26, 27, 28]. Reference [1] provides a rigorous survey of PCM properties, examines PCM buffer organization, and proposes partial writes to tolerate the long latency and high energy of writes. Reference [2] explores the high density feature to increase main memory capacity with minimal cost and power. A hybrid memory system consisting of PCM storage coupled with a small DRAM buffer is proposed, combining the low latency benefit of DRAM and the high capacity benefits of PCM. Additionally, [29] proposes a morphable memory system that dynamically regulates the number of bits per cell based on workload requirements for performance enhancement, while our schemes focus on reliability. Reference [27] proposes and evaluates an adaptive bit flip technique to enhance write performance, energy, and endurance. Although PCM can increase memory capacity in a cost-effective and power-efficient manner, limited endurance imposes a constraint on the lifespan of PCM-based memory. Reference [14] investigates a 3D die-stacked PCM memory with architectural and OS support. To maximize PCM lifespan, [4] presents techniques such as redundant bit-write removal, row shifting, and segment swapping. Furthermore, [3] proposes a simple and effective wear-leveling technique using only two registers instead of large storage to minimize area and latency overhead. Additionally, [26] characterizes the impact of process variation on PCM systems and proposes techniques to mitigate the deleterious impact of process variation in upcoming nano-scale processing technology. Our study differs from these works in that we focus on multi-level cell PCM and investigate the impact of its drift phenomena on readout reliability. To our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses PCM resistance drift reliability using holistic approaches.

### VIII. Conclusions

The multi-level cell (MLC) capability of PCM makes it well-suited for designing high-density memory and disk cache systems. One of the main challenges in MLC-PCM systems is read reliability degradation due to resistance drift. In this study, we characterize the impact of resistance drift on MLC-PCM readout error rate in a MLC-PCM/DRAM hybrid memory and show that drift can cause severe reliability issues. A conservative approach to tolerate drift and meet the reliability target is to enlarge the margin between adjacent states. However, such a naïve approach can cause up to 2.3X power overhead and reduce the effective lifetime of a PCM system by up to 100X. We propose data inversion and rotation, hybrid SLC/MLC design, and temperature-aware page allocation schemes that can effectively improve drift tolerance, allowing smaller margins to satisfy the reliability requirements in a power- and endurance-efficient manner. Our experimental results show that the aggregated effect of the proposed mechanisms can reduce the error rate by an average of 87%, and the lower error rate allows up to a 3% performance improvement. For a given reliability target (i.e., lower than 1% error rate in our study), using the smaller margin enabled by our proposed mechanisms achieves 28% power savings and 15X endurance enhancement compared to simply enlarging the margin. Although we focus on MLC-PCM-based hybrid memory design in this work, the issue of resistance drift remains for MLC-PCM-based disk cache design, to which our proposed techniques can also be applied.
