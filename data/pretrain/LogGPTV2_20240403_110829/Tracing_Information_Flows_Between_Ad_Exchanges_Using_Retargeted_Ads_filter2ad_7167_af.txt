is not surprising, given that Criteo was identified as the
largest retargeter in the US and UK in 2014 [15].
In contrast, SSPs tend to have in/out degree ratios
closer to 1, since they facilitate the exchange of ads be-
tween multiple publishers, DSPs, and even other SSPs.
Some SSPs, like Atwola, work more closely with pub-
lishers and thus appear more frequently at p2, while oth-
ers, like Mathtag, cater to other SSPs and thus appear
almost exclusively at pn−1. Most of the SSPs we observe
also function as DSPs (i.e., they serve some retargeted
ads), but there are “pure” SSPs like Casale Media and
OpenX that do not serve ads. Lastly, Table 3 reveals that

SSPs tend to do more user tracking than DSPs, by getting
embedded in more e-commerce sites (with Criteo being
the notable exception).
Google is an interesting case study because its
different domains have clearly delineated purposes.
googletagservices is Google’s in-house SSP, which
funnels impressions directly from publishers to Google’s
DSPs: 2mdn, googlesyndication, and doubleclick.
In contrast, googleadservices is also an SSP, but it
holds auctions with third-party participants (e.g., Criteo).
googlesyndication and doubleclick function as
both SSPs and DSPs, sometimes holding auctions, and
sometimes winning auctions held by others to serve ads.
Google Syndication is the second most frequent source
of retargeted ads in our dataset behind Criteo.
7 Concluding Discussion
In this study, we develop a novel, principled methodol-
ogy for detecting flows of tracking information between
ad exchanges. The key insight behind our approach is
that we re-purpose retargeted ads as a detection mech-
anism, since their presence reveals information flows
between ad exchanges. Our methodology is content-
agnostic, and thus we are able to identify flows even if
they occur on the server-side. This is a significant im-
provement over prior work, which relies on heuristics to
detect cookie matching [2, 54, 21]. As we show in § 6,
these heuristics fail to detect 31% of matching pairs to-
day, and they are likely to fail more in the future as ad
networks adopt content obfuscation techniques.
Implications for Users.
Ultimately, our goal is not
just to measure information flows between ad exchanges,
but to facilitate the development of systems that balance
user privacy against the revenue needs of publishers.
Currently, users are faced with unsatisfactory choices
when deciding if and how to block ads and tracking.
Whitelisting approaches like NoScript are effective at
protecting privacy, but are too complicated for most
users, and deprive publishers of revenue. Blocking third-
party cookies is ineffective against first-party trackers
(e.g., Facebook). AdBlockPlus’ controversial “Accept-
able Ads” program is poorly governed and leaves users
vulnerable to unscrupulous ad networks [62]. DNT is
DOA [8]. Although researchers have proposed privacy
preserving ad exchanges, these systems have yet to see
widespread adoption [22, 28, 7].
We believe that data about information flows between
ad exchanges potentially opens up a new middle ground
in ad blocking. One possibility is to develop an auto-
mated system that uses the methodology developed in
this paper to continuously crawl ads, identify cookie
matching flows, and construct rules that match these
flows. Users could then install a browser extension that
blocks flows matching these rules. The advantage of this
extension is that it would offer improved privacy protec-
tion relative to existing systems (e.g., Ghostery and Dis-
connect), while also allowing advertising (as opposed to
traditional ad blockers). However, the open challenge
with this system design would be making it cost effec-
tive, since it would still rely crowdsourced labor.
Another possibility is using our data as ground-truth
for a sophisticated blocker that relies on client-side In-
formation Flow Control (IFC). There exist many promis-
ing, lightweight approaches to implementing JavaScript
IFC in the browser [30, 10, 59, 31]. However, IFC alone
is not enough to block cookie matching flows: as we
have shown, ad networks obfuscate data, making it im-
possible to separate benign from “leaky” flows in gen-
eral. Instead, we can use information gathered using our
methodology as ground-truth to mark data in specific in-
coming flows, and rely on IFC to enforce restrictions that
prevent outgoing flows from containing the marked data.
