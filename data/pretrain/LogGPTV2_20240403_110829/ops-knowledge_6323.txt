User: How to use the SSH protocol to remotely log in and manage a Linux server? Please provide specific steps.
Assistant: SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for remote login and management of Linux servers. The following are the specific operation steps for using the SSH protocol to remotely log in and manage the Linux server: 1. Open the local terminal or command line window. 2. Enter the command ssh user@target host IP or domain name, where user is the user name on the target host, and target host IP and domain name represent the IP address and domain name of the target host. 3. If it is the first time to connect, a prompt will appear asking whether the ssh public key fingerprint is acceptable, enter yes and press Enter. 4. Enter the password of the target host user as prompted and press Enter. 5. After successfully connecting to the target host, you can enter various Linux commands for management operations. For example: - pwd: Displays the current directory. - ls: List the files and subdirectories in the current directory. - cd: switch to the specified directory. - mkdir: Create a new directory. - rm: delete a file or directory. 6. When you need to exit the remote connection, you can enter the command exit and press the Enter key, or close the terminal window directly. Summary: Using the SSH protocol to remotely log in and manage Linux servers is mainly to connect to the target host by entering the ssh command in the local terminal or command line window, then enter the user name and password to log in, and finally use various Linux commands for management operations.
