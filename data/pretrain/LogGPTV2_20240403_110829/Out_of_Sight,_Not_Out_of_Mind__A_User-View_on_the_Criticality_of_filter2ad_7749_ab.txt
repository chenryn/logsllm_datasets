traceroute, we iterate through a list of submarine cables,
testing if it is possible for a signal to traverse from source to
destination, via the landing site of a given cable, within the
minimum measured time. Listing 1 describes this test.

The following paragraphs present the data collection process
and describe the dataset used in our analysis. We select a
list of countries per region that, together, capture a signif-
icant portion of Internet users for (most) regions and the

world [11]. We use the top sites ranking provided by Alexa,
which consists of the most popular sites visited by users in
each country/region, and various VPN services to identify
the resources served by these sites to users in those coun-
tries. We then launch traceroutes to the hosting resources
from RIPE Atlas nodes within those same countries. For sub-
marine cable detection, we rely on the SCN dataset made
publicly available by TeleGeography [35]. We ran this data
collection process twice between April and September of
2020, with the same list of countries and websites.
4.1 Countries and Regions
For data collection, we focus on countries that(1) host servers
with available VPNs with DNS servers within the country,
(2) have good coverage of RIPE Atlas probes [31], and (3)
for which Alexa Top Sites [8] data exists. Our set includes
63 countries covering every sub-region in the world, includ-
ing the Americas, Europe, Asia, Oceania3, Middle East and
Africa.
3We treat Australia as an island country based on our definition.

While the SCN interconnects almost every country in
the world, we expect the criticality of this network to vary
widely depending on features such as sub-region, geography
and Internet penetration. For example, we would expect an
island-country like Japan to rely on the SCN more heavily
than a landlocked country like Switzerland would. Thus we
classify each country [12, 13] as Island, Landlocked or Other.
An Island country is defined as one without land borders
with other countries/regions, while a Landlocked country
is defined as one with only land borders. The remaining
countries are classified as Other. Table 1 lists, for each sub-
region, the number of countries included per class, and the
percentages of Internet users in both the sub-region and
the world. For instance, in Europe, our dataset includes 34
countries, 9 of which are Landlocked countries and 3 of
which are Island countries. Together, they capture 83.5%
of the Internet user population of Europe and 13.3% of the
world’s Internet population. The percentage of the Internet
population covered is computed as the fraction contributed
by the sub-region times the percentage of the sub-region’s
Internet population captured by our dataset. For most sub-
regions, we have included enough countries so as to cover
> 75% of the Internet user population in that sub-region.
Two exceptions are in the Middle East and Africa, together
contributing 15.4% of the world Internet population, where
we could not find sufficient vantage points, particularly from
VPN services.
4.2 Web Page Resources Dataset
For the selected countries, we use the local Alexa Top-50
sites as a proxy for the most popular Internet resources users
in those countries rely on (with a total of 1864 websites).
While some popular sites may be similar across countries
(≈1% of sites are shared by ≈50% of the countries), the set of
resources those sites rely on and the servers hosting those
resources are likely to be different. To capture the actual re-
sources users in specific countries rely on, we employ servers
hosted by the Nord [14], Cyberghost [9], HideMyAss [10] and
Transocks [15] VPN services as web vantage points when
crawling these sites. For each VPN connection, we use a
Selenium-controlled Chrome web browser instance to crawl
the sites.
Since a single server could host multiple resources, we
maintain a map matching resources requested to server IP ad-
dress. On average, each country is mapped to 848 unique IP
addresses hosting web resources. We then use the designed
IP geolocation pipeline to geolocate all the unique resource
server IP addresses. On average, we were able to geolocate
61.24% of the server IP addresses, which corresponds to an
average of 66.28% of all resources geolocated for all coun-
tries/regions. As a last step, we use a publicly available tool
for tagging resources with CDNs [4, 23].
4.3 Traceroutes and Country Level Routes
With the collected set of resources and their correspond-
ing hosting servers identified, we launch traceroute mea-
surements to the different hosting servers from RIPE Atlas
probes in the respective countries. We thus collect 53,419
traceroute measurements for our analysis. To better under-
stand the criticality of the SCN for landlocked countries, we
derive a country-level path from the collected traceroutes by
geolocating each router on the path.
4.4 Submarine Cable Data
We collect information on submarine cables, including land-
ing sites and their geographic coordinates, countries, and
cable length, using the dataset made publicly available by
TeleGeography [35]. The overall dataset consists of the main
information for all submarine cables currently deployed or
under construction around the world. We iterate through all
submarine cables listed on the TeleGeography public dataset,
and use all pairs of landing points that are connected by
each submarine cable to create a table of key-value pairs. We
use the countries of the two landing sites as keys, with the
values being the sets of submarine cables that connect the
two countries.
4.5 Summary of the Dataset
In summary, our dataset includes an average of 12,199 unique
resources per country, for 63 countries around the world.
These resources are hosted by the Alexa Top-50 sites for each
country, with a total of 1864 unique websites. We resolve each
resource URL to get the IP address of the server hosting the
resource. On average, we observe 848 unique IP addresses for
the selected countries. For each pair of country and IP address
hosting resources for content accessed from that country, we
launch traceroute measurements using an in-country RIPE
probe towards the IP address. In total we generate 53,419
traceroute measurements for our analysis. All dataset and
VPN configurations are publicly available.
5 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
We now present results from our analysis of the criticality
of the SCN infrastructure for different countries around the
world, focusing both on individual Internet resources and
full websites. We look at the benefits of CDNs and frame our
results in terms of the Internet population impacted.

graphic category, both absolute and normalized by In-
ternet penetration per country.
5.1 Criticality
We first look at the criticality of the SCN, separating coun-
tries based on their geographic categories (i.e., Landlocked,
Island, and Other). Figure 1 shows the distribution of SCN
hit rates per geographic category. As a reminder, we define
criticality (§2) in terms of the fraction of “popular” Internet
resources hosted on the other side of a submarine cable.
As one would expect, Island countries are the most depen-
dent on the SCN, with an average SCN hit rate of 42.7% and
a maximum hit rate at 64.33% (Cyprus).4 For regions clas-
sified as “Other” (neither landlocked nor islands), we find
a lower yet significant reliance on the SCN infrastructure,
