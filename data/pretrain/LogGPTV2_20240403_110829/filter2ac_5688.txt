**ATT&CK ID:** T0883  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Internet-Accessible Device

**Description:**
Adversaries may gain access to industrial environments by targeting systems that are directly exposed to the internet for remote access, rather than through external remote services. These internet-accessible devices may be unintentionally or intentionally exposed without adequate security measures. This exposure can allow adversaries to move directly into the control system network.

Access to these devices is typically achieved without the use of exploits. If exploits are used, such activity would be categorized under the "Exploit Public-Facing Application" technique.
