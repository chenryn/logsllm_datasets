**Current behavior**
It seems impossible to navigate to some path and clear any named outlets in
the process. Consider this code:
    this.router.navigate(['/', { outlets: { secondary: null } });
This does not remove the `(secondary:)` portion from the path. However this
code does remove that segment:
    this.router.navigate([{ outlets: { secondary: null } });
In addition `this.router.navigateByUrl('/')` also works.
**Expected behavior**
The first code should also work and remove the secondary outlet segment from
the path.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
The current behavior looks erroneous. I believe there should be an `else` here
which sets `children[outlet]` to `null` so it is not initialized later.
**Please tell us about your environment:**
  * **Angular version:** 2.4.10
Code in master looks the same as in 2.4.10.
  * **Browser:** [all | Chrome XX | Firefox XX | IE XX | Safari XX | Mobile Chrome XX | Android X.X Web Browser | iOS XX Safari | iOS XX UIWebView | iOS XX WKWebView ]
All browsers.
  * **Language:** [all | TypeScript X.X | ES6/7 | ES5]  
I think it is a framework issue rather than a language one.
  * **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` =
