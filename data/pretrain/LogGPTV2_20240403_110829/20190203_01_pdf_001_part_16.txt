In the Filter dialog box, enter a descriptive filter name and the filter clause to select the
rows you want to replicate. The filter name and filter clause must meet the following
conditions:
 For any given table or view, each filter rule must be assigned a unique filter name.
 For any given table or view, the filter clauses must have different syntaxes (that
is, the filtering criteria must be different).
In the following example a filter rule is defined on the DEPT table so only rows where the
deptno column contains 10, 20, or 30 are included in replications. All other rows are
excluded from replication.

The following shows a rule added to the EMP table by choosing EDB.EMP from the
Table/View drop-down list and then entering the selection criteria for only rows with
deptno containing 10 in the Filter dialog box.
Figure 5-12 - Adding a filter rule for the EMP table
Repeating this process, additional filter rules can be added for the EMP table. The
following shows the complete set of available filter rules defined for the DEPT and EMP
tables.

To remove a filter rule, click the primary mouse button on the filter rule you wish to
remove so the entry is highlighted and then click the Remove Filter button.
You may also modify the filter name or filter clause of a filter rule listed in the Table
Filters tab by double-clicking on the cell of the filter name or filter clause you wish to
change. When the cursor appears in the cell, enter the text for the desired change.
When creating a subscription, you may selectively enable these table filters on the
corresponding subscription tables. See Section 5.3.3 for information on creating a
subscription.
Step 4: Click the Create button. If Publication Created Successfully appears, click the
OK button, otherwise investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

5.2.4 Control Schema Objects Created for a Publication
After you have added a publication database definition and publications you will find the
following control schema objects have been created in addition to your original
publication tables and views:
 In the publication database, control schema objects are created to control and
manage the xDB replication systems. How the control schema objects are
organized under the actual, physical database schemas depends upon the
publication database server type (that is, whether it is Oracle, SQL Server, or
Postgres).
 If the publication is not a snapshot-only publication, that is synchronization
replication is permitted, and synchronization replication is implemented using the
trigger-based method, then three triggers and one shadow table are created for
each publication table as part of the control schema.
 If the publication is using synchronization replication with the log-based method,
then a single trigger is created for each publication table as part of the control
schema.
The following sections list the control schema objects found in an Oracle, SQL Server,
and Postgres publication database.
Do not manually delete any of these database objects as the replication system
control schema will become corrupted.
When you remove publications and publication database definitions using the xDB
Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI, the control schema objects are
deleted during the removal process.
5.2.4.1 Oracle Control Schema Objects
The control schema objects created in the publication database user’s schema (that is, the
control schema) are shown in the following output:
SQL> CONNECT pubuser/password
Connected.
SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
SQL> SELECT table_name FROM user_tables ORDER BY table_name;

on user_triggers are found only for synchronization publications. In this
