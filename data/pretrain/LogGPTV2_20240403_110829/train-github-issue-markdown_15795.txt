Retrieving the last termination status or resources for a pod can be challenging, but one effective method is to use the `kubectl get pods` command with the `-o` (output) option. This allows you to specify the format of the output, making it easier to extract the required information.

For example, you can use:
```sh
kubectl get pods <pod-name> -o json | jq '.status.containerStatuses[0].lastState.terminated'
```
This command will provide detailed information about the last terminated state of the pod, including the exit code and reason.

Alternatively, you can use the `yaml` format for a more human-readable output:
```sh
kubectl get pods <pod-name> -o yaml
```
Then, look for the `lastState` section under `containerStatuses` to find the termination details.
