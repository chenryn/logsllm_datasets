User: Please design a complete system architecture based on the following server configuration information and deployment requirements, and explain its advantages and disadvantages. Server configuration:\nCPU: Intel Xeon E5-2670 2.60GHz\nMemory: 32GB DDR3\nHard disk: 2TB SATA 7200RPM\nDeployment requirements:\nAn enterprise-level web application needs to be deployed, and the daily PV volume is expected to be more than 1 million. At the same time, data security and high availability need to be guaranteed.
Assistant: Architecture design plan: 1. Number of servers: at least 2 servers, one as a web server and the other as a database server. 2. Load balancer: Add a load balancer before the web server and database server to distribute traffic and ensure high availability. 3. Database technology selection: choose a high-performance database technology, such as MySQL Cluster, and use MySQL's master-slave replication to ensure data security and backup availability. 4. Caching technology: Use caching technology, such as Redis or Memcached, to reduce the number of database accesses. 5. Firewall: Install and configure a firewall to filter and check all incoming data to ensure data security. 6. Security audit system: Install and configure a security audit system to ensure that all access to the system is recorded and tracked, and preventive responses to abnormal events are made in a timely manner. 7. Safety backup: Regular data backup and data recovery test are carried out regularly to ensure data availability. Advantages: 1. High availability: Introduce load balancing technology to ensure that services can still be provided in the case of server downtime; 2. Data security: use MySQL's master-slave replication technology to ensure data security, and use firewalls and security audit systems to Data security and controllability; 3. High concurrency: Using caching technology can reduce the number of database accesses and improve system performance and concurrency. Disadvantages: 1. Relatively high deployment cost: at least 2 servers are required to install and configure complex system components, requiring higher deployment costs; 2. Higher complexity: due to the configuration and coordination of multiple system components, in Certain technical skills are required for deployment and operation and maintenance.
