### Different Privacy Requirements for Various Groups

The heterogeneous condensation method can handle both static and dynamic data sets. This approach creates condensed groups of records, which can be used directly with a variety of data mining algorithms or with minor modifications to existing ones.

#### Data Representation and Grouping

Consider a set of \( n \) records, where each record \( R_i \) has a corresponding privacy level \( P(R_i) \). The complete database is denoted by \( D \), and the subset of the database corresponding to privacy level \( p \) is represented by \( D_p \). The data is partitioned into several groups, each containing \( d \) dimensions. Records within a given group are indistinguishable from one another, and summary statistics are maintained for each group. These summary statistics enable the direct application of data mining algorithms to the condensed groups.

The size of each group must be at least equal to the maximum privacy level of any record in that group. For each group \( G \) containing records \( \{R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_k\} \), the following summary statistics are maintained:
1. **Sum of attribute values**: For each attribute \( j \), the sum \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} R_i(j) \).
2. **Sum of privacy levels**: The sum \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(R_i) \).
3. **Product of attribute values**: The product \( \prod_{i=1}^{k} R_i(j) \) for each pair of attributes \( i \) and \( j \).
4. **Total number of records**: The count \( k \).

#### Group Construction and Segmentation

During the construction of groups, each record must be inserted into a group whose size is at least equal to the maximum privacy level of any record in the group. The process involves:
1. **Classifying records based on privacy levels**.
2. **Creating groups for various privacy levels individually**.
3. **Segmenting the database** to form natural clusters. If a group does not form a natural cluster, it can be reassigned to one or more clusters.

After segmentation, the process of attrition and cannibalization is applied to reduce information loss without compromising privacy requirements. Cannibalization is performed by moving excess points from one group to another, thereby improving the quality of data representation.

#### Association Rule Generation and Hiding

**A. Association Rule Generation**

The Apriori algorithm is applied to the dataset to generate frequent itemsets and association rules. An association rule \( A \rightarrow B \) satisfies the following conditions:
- Support: \( \text{supp}(A \cup B) \geq \text{min\_supp} \)
- Confidence: \( \text{conf}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{supp}(A \cup B)}{\text{supp}(A)} \geq \text{min\_conf} \)

Where:
- \( \text{supp}(X) \) is the support of itemset \( X \).
- \( \text{min\_supp} \) and \( \text{min\_conf} \) are user-defined threshold values.

**B. Hiding Association Rules**

There are two methods for hiding association rules:
1. **Increasing the support of \( A \)**: This decreases the confidence of the rule \( A \rightarrow B \).
2. **Decreasing the support of \( B \)**: This reduces the confidence of the rule \( A \rightarrow B \).

A hybrid algorithm combining ISL (Item Set Level) and DSR (Data Set Reduction) techniques is used to hide rules. The algorithm first hides rules where item \( A \) is on the right-hand side (RHS) and then hides rules where item \( A \) is on the left-hand side (LHS).

### Conclusion

In this paper, a system is proposed for maximizing privacy and minimizing information loss while sharing data without disclosing individual identities. Condensation and covariance-based methods are used for preserving privacy. Association rule hiding using ISL and DSR techniques modifies the database transactions to reduce the confidence of association rules.
