of individuals. 
The heterogeneous condensation is able to handle both 
static  and  dynamic  data  sets.  This  approach  creates 
condensed  groups  of  records,  which  can  be  used  directly 
with a variety data mining algorithm or directly with minor 
change in existing data mining algorithms.  
Let consider that I have a set of (cid:1840)	records and each of 
with  each  data  point (cid:1861),with  corresponding  privacy  level 
(cid:1868)((cid:1861)). The complete database is represented by D, Whereas 
the  database  corresponding  to  the  privacy  level	(cid:1868)    is 
represented by 	(cid:1830)(cid:1868).The data  is partitioned  into  number of 
which  contain  ddimensions,  also  assume  that  associated 
groups of records.Records within a given group cannot be 
distinguished from one another. For all the groups need to 
maintain certain summary statistics about the records. This 
summary statistics provides the ability to apply data mining 
algorithms directly to the condensed groups of records. 
The size of groups may be of different size but its size 
must be of at least equal to the desired privacy level of each 
record of that group.

While constructing group each record must be inserted 
in  a  group  which  must  be  at  least  equal  to  maximum 
privacy level of any record in the group.

privacy  levels  and  then  create  the  groups  for  various

which have no privacy constraints at all. 
The  privacy  level  of  each  group  is  calculated  by  the 
number  of  records  present  in  it.  The  information  loss  is 
defined by the average difference of the record about their 
centroid. The input given to the algorithm is the database D 
with  the  maximum  privacy  level  which  is  referred  by 
MaxPLevel.

If group (cid:1833)	€	(cid:1834)(cid:3043)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)does not form a natural cluster then

For  better  fitment  group  in (cid:1834)(cid:3043)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)need  to  move  the

In first level dataset is collected from condensed group

hidden by using hybrid algorithm which is combination of 
both ISL and DSR technique.

B.  Hiding Association Rule 
There are two ways for hiding association rule. First by 
increasing the support of A I can decrease the confidence of 
right  hand  side  of  the  rule,  this  would  reduce  the 
confidence  faster  than  simply  reducing  the  support  of 
one item at a time by changing from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 in 
a selected transaction. Hybrid algorithm will first hide the 
rules  in  which  item  Ain  RHS  and  then  hide  the  rules  in 
which item A in LHS.
