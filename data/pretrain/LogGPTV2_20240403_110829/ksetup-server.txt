ksetup server
Allows you to specify a name for a computer running the Windows operating system, so changes made by the ksetup command update the target computer.
The target server name is stored in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\LSA\Kerberos. This entry isn't reported when you run the ksetup command.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\LSA\Kerberos
Important
There's no way to remove the targeted server name. Instead, you can change it back to the local computer name, which is the default.
