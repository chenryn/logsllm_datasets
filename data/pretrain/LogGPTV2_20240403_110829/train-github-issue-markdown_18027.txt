_Glide_ : 3.7.0  
_Integration libraries_ : no  
_Devices_ : currently running on emulator only, hardware GPU rendering  
_Issue_ : animated GIFs generally work well, except that the final frame's
delay is being ignored. The product design involves having a long delay on the
last frame so that the final rendering can be reviewed again. Instead the last
frame flashes quickly and then it returns to the beginning.  
A secondary issue: not only should it be waiting to cycle back to the
beginning for the amount stated in the duration, but the particular GIFs being
tested are set to only 1 iteration (meaning in theory they should not ever
recycle).  
To reproduce, generate a GIF with a long delay on the last frame. Then display
the GIF. It appears to flicker right back to the beginning. Viewing the same
GIF in a web browser or posting to e.g. FB messenger, the delay is properly
observed.
_Layout Design_ : FrameLayout with a single ImageView inside. (added) These
are inside a RecyclerView. I am testing with ~ 20 items at one time.  
_Code Design_ : using a RecyclerViewAdapter; Glide code is in onBindViewHolder
_Error Messages_ : I am getting the following, from reading up it doesn't
sound like this is related but curious of others' opinions:  
W/Bitmap: Called reconfigure on a bitmap that is in use! ...
