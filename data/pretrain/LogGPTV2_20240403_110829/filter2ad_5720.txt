Abstract
PhFit, a new Phase-type ﬁtting tool is presented in this
paper. PhFit allows for approximating distributions or set
of samples not only by continuous but by discrete Phase-
type distributions as well. The implemented algorithms sep-
arate the ﬁtting of the body and the tail part of the distribu-
tion which results in satisfactory ﬁtting also for heavy-tail
distributions. Moreover, PhFit allows the user to choose
the distance measure according to which the ﬁtting is per-
formed. The tool is equipped with a graphical interface that
visualizes the goodness of the provided approximation from
several aspects.
Keywords: Phase-type distribution, Phase-type ﬁtting
1 Introduction
Continuous and Discrete Phase-type (CPH,DPH) distri-
butions are deﬁned as the distribution of time to absorption
in Continuous- and Discrete-time Markov chains with one
absorbing state, respectively. In the recent decades, a lot
of research was carried out to handle stochastic models in
which durations are CPH or DPH distributed.
In order to exploit recent advances in handling models
with PH distributed activity durations, one needs algorithms
to determine the parameters of the applied PH distribution.
Despite the effort made to invent ﬁtting algorithms, none
of the methods gained widespread use in applied stochastic
modeling. The aim of this paper is to present PhFit, a Phase-
type ﬁtting tool which is novel from several aspects and pro-
vides the modeler with functionality to perform and validate
the ﬁtting process. The next section gives a brief overview
of the input, output and the algorithms implemented in Ph-
Fit. A more detailed description of the tool is given in [3].

The tool requires the following input:
(cid:15) The distribution to be ﬁtted can be given either by a ﬁnite
set of samples or can be chosen from a set of distributions.
(cid:15) PhFit implements a special method to ﬁt distributions with
heavy-tailed behavior [2]. The user has to deﬁne the type of
the tail decay (either polynomial or exponential), its associ-
ated parameter and its weight.
(cid:15) The ﬁtting can be performed either by CPH or by DPH
distributions. A comparison of CPH and DPH distribution
can be found in [1]. In case of DPH ﬁtting of a continuous
distribution the time unit of the discrete approximation has
to be deﬁned as well. This time unit is the mapping of one
step of the DPH to some natural time unit.
(cid:15) The distance measure which is minimized by the ﬁtting
algorithm has to be selected. The measure can be the cumu-
lative density function (cdf) area difference, the probability
density function (pdf) area difference or the cross-entropy.
(cid:15) The user has to deﬁne the number of phases to ﬁt the body
and the number of phases to ﬁt the tail of the distribution.
The output of the tool consists of
(cid:15) the representation of the approximate PH distribution,
(cid:15) ﬁgures depicting either the body or the tail of the cdf, pdf
or complementary cdf of the approximating distribution,
(cid:15) various indicators of the goodness of ﬁtting like moments
and their relative errors, the distance of the approximating
distribution from the original one according to various dis-
tance measures (cdf and pdf area difference, cross-entropy),
ﬁgures depicting the relative error of the pdf, cdf or ccdf.
