## Abstract
PhFit, a new Phase-type fitting tool, is introduced in this paper. This tool allows for the approximation of distributions or sets of samples using both continuous and discrete Phase-type (CPH, DPH) distributions. The implemented algorithms separate the fitting of the body and tail parts of the distribution, resulting in satisfactory fitting even for heavy-tailed distributions. Additionally, PhFit enables users to choose the distance measure according to which the fitting is performed. The tool is equipped with a graphical interface that visualizes the quality of the provided approximation from multiple perspectives.

**Keywords:** Phase-type distribution, Phase-type fitting

## 1. Introduction
Continuous and Discrete Phase-type (CPH, DPH) distributions are defined as the time-to-absorption distributions in Continuous- and Discrete-time Markov chains with one absorbing state, respectively. In recent decades, significant research has been conducted to handle stochastic models where durations follow CPH or DPH distributions.

To leverage recent advancements in handling models with PH-distributed activity durations, algorithms are needed to determine the parameters of the applied PH distribution. Despite efforts to develop fitting algorithms, none have gained widespread use in applied stochastic modeling. This paper presents PhFit, a novel Phase-type fitting tool that offers several unique features and provides modelers with the functionality to perform and validate the fitting process. The next section provides a brief overview of the input, output, and algorithms implemented in PhFit. A more detailed description of the tool can be found in [3].

### Input Requirements
The tool requires the following inputs:

- **Distribution to be fitted**: Can be provided either as a finite set of samples or chosen from a predefined set of distributions.
- **Tail behavior**: For distributions with heavy-tailed behavior, the user must define the type of tail decay (polynomial or exponential), its associated parameter, and its weight.
- **Fitting type**: The fitting can be performed using either CPH or DPH distributions. For DPH fitting of a continuous distribution, the time unit of the discrete approximation must also be defined. This time unit maps one step of the DPH to a natural time unit.
- **Distance measure**: The user must select the distance measure to be minimized by the fitting algorithm. Options include the cumulative density function (CDF) area difference, the probability density function (PDF) area difference, or cross-entropy.
- **Number of phases**: The user must specify the number of phases to fit the body and the number of phases to fit the tail of the distribution.

### Output
The tool provides the following outputs:

- **Approximate PH distribution representation**.
- **Figures** depicting the body or tail of the CDF, PDF, or complementary CDF of the approximating distribution.
- **Goodness-of-fit indicators**, including moments and their relative errors, the distance of the approximating distribution from the original one according to various distance measures (CDF and PDF area difference, cross-entropy), and figures showing the relative error of the PDF, CDF, or CCDF.
