User: Analyze the possible fault causes of the following phenomena, and provide solutions that involve modifying/saving entries and other commands that need to write to the disk (such as tar, cp, mv, rm, chmod, chown, wget download, etc.). It is a prompt for Read-only file system, which means that the system is read-only and nothing can be written.
Assistant: Causes of failure: ①The file system is damaged; ②Disk problem, and the disk has bad sectors; ③fstab file configuration error, such as partition format error (write ntfs as fat), configuration command spelling error, etc. Check the website program, see the error message, service log error, and system log to locate the problem. Solution: ①If you can confirm that the data and system files are not damaged, after repairing the fstab file configuration, you only need to reload R/W or reboot to restore to normal. Remount the file system in read-write mode mount -o rw, remount /system② If there is a problem with the file system, you need to execute the fsck command in the umount state to check the file system and repair the errors in the file system. nohup fsck -y /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 > /dev/shm/fscklog & # After checking, reboot and restart ③If the disk hardware is damaged, the best way is to replace it with a new hard disk. If you feel that it is a pity to throw away the old hard disk, you can also low-level format it and then reinstall the system. After the system is reinstalled, the disk will be repartitioned. ④ If you just want to back up the data and the machine is with you, you can use a live-cd to start the system from the CD, and then back it up directly. Of course, you can also modify the configuration files in the hard disk at this time, such as /etc/fstab.
