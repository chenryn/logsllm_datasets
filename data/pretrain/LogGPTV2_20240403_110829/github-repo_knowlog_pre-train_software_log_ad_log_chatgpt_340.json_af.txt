  "-[NETClientConnection effectiveBundleID] using process name apsd as bundle ID (this is expected for daemons without bundle ID",  "This log is referring to a process named \"apsd\" that does not have a bundle ID. The bundle ID is a unique identifier for processes in macOS and iOS. Normally, processes should have bundle IDs to distinguish themselves from other processes. However, in the case of daemons, which are background processes that run without user interaction, it is expected that they may not have bundle IDs.\n\nThe log is indicating that the \"NETClientConnection\" is using the process name \"apsd\" as the effective bundle ID. The \"NETClientConnection\" is a network connection in this context. It is using the process name \"apsd\" as an identifier for the connection, and since \"apsd\" does not have a bundle ID, it is considered the effective bundle ID.\n\nOverall, this log is not indicating an issue with the system. It is simply providing information about a network connection using a process name as an identifier."

  "RTC: PowerByCalendarDate setting ignored",  "The RTC (Real Time Clock) is a computer clock that keeps track of time even when the computer is turned off. PowerByCalendarDate is a setting that controls when the RTC should power on the system, indicating that specific date is reached instead of regular intervals like minutes or hours. The log entry \"PowerByCalendarDate setting ignored\" may indicate that the setting was set but ignored, or simply that it was not set at all. \n\nThis log message may appear due to various reasons, one of which could be an incorrect configuration for the RTC, for example, if the setting was turned off. Another reason could be a software error or a fault in the hardware system. The solution would depend on the root cause of the error. To determine the cause, an engineer may need to do a thorough analysis of the RTC, the configuration settings, and any associated software applications or hardware systems. If the issue is a configuration error, the engineer may need to adjust or enable the PowerByCalendarDate setting. In the case of a software or hardware fault, the engineer may need to replace or repair the affected components."

  "PMStats: Hibernate read took 197 ms",  "PMStats relates to Performance Management Statistics and is a tool used to measure application performance. Hibernate is a java framework which is often used for object-relational mapping and managing database operations. A \"read\" operation means that the application interacts with the database to retrieve data. In this case, the \"Hibernate read\" operation took 197ms to complete. This log entry indicates the time it took for the application to retrieve the necessary data from the database. A read operation can take longer if the size of data is vast or the database server is under pressure. Hibernate read time is vital to analyse the performance of the application. If the read time is higher than expected, it is generally an indication that further optimisation is necessary like reindexing the tables or adding indexes to table columns which will improve the read performance."
