venues in ﬁve subcategories: Computer Security & Cryptog-
raphy, for its relevance to authentication; Computer Vision
& Pattern Recognition and Signal Processing, because of
their relevance to biometric authentication techniques; Human
Computer Interaction, because AR and VR are a focus of the
HCI community; and Engineering & Computer Science (gen-
eral), to ensure all top venues were considered. We considered
the top 20 venues in each subcategory, then supplemented this
list with venues from CSRankings [1] under the Computer
Vision, Computer Security, Mobile Computing, and Human-
Computer Interaction categories. We removed workshops from
the list of venues. In total, we considered 102 top venues.
Keywords used. For authentication: “authentication”, “au-
thenticate”, “authenticating”, “authenticated”, “user identiﬁca-
tion”, “password”, and “biometric”. For AR and VR: “vir-
tual reality”, “augmented reality”, “mixed reality”, “smart
glasses”, “smartglasses”, “head-mounted displays”, and “head-
worn display”. We curated these keywords based on manual
searches on Google Scholar for papers relevant to AR/VR
authentication.
Appendix D
Definitions of Evaluation Criteria
Fig. 8 shows why we included each criterion. Our deﬁni-
tions for each of the evaluation criteria are as follows.
Deployment criteria.
(1) OS-Supported: The method is built into the SDK or
similarly available for use by developers with close to
no eﬀort.
(2) Platform-Agnostic: The method could also be used on a
computer or smartphone with no additional hardware.
For example, a method that requires the use of con-
trollers is not platform-agnostic. Though computers and
smartphones usually have user-facing cameras, we do
not consider iris scanning or other eye biometrics to be
platform-agnostic since most methods currently require
external devices or are speciﬁc to AR/VR cameras. A
scheme is quasi-Platform-Agnostic if The method only
requires extra hardware which it is plausible the user will
have (e.g. EarEcho requires an earbud), or the method is
common across platforms but in a slightly diﬀerent form
(e.g. gait has been explored on smartphones and smart
watches, but usually does not use head movement like
in an HMD.
(3) Mature: The scheme has been implemented and deployed

on a large scale for actual authentication purposes beyond
research. A scheme is quasi-Mature if the foundational
scheme is mature, but is implemented slightly diﬀerently
(e.g., a classic PIN entered on a shuﬄed keyboard).
(4) Low-Power-Consumption: The method does not perform
any type of signal processing. The method may also
fulﬁll the criterion if it performs signal processing but
is proven to have a negligible eﬀect on the battery life
of the device. Incumbent methods are assumed to have
Low-Power-Consumption.
Usability criteria.
(1) Eﬃcient-to-Use: The time the user must spend authen-
ticating comparable to biometrics, i.e. nearly instanta-
neous. A scheme is quasi-Eﬃcient-to-Use if the time the
user must spend authenticating is comparable to using a
PIN on a smartphone, i.e. 2-3 seconds.
(2) Physically-Eﬀortless: The authentication process does
not involve explicit actions requiring physical eﬀort. We
consider eye movement to be eﬀortless actions. A scheme
is quasi-Physically-Eﬀortless if the user’s eﬀort is limited
to a single movement comparable to a button press (e.g.,
one tap on the Google Glass touchpad), or involves only
speech.
(3) Memorywise-Eﬀortless: Users of the scheme do not have
to remember any secrets at all. A scheme is quasi-
Memorywise-Eﬀortless if users have to remember one
secret for everything (as opposed to one per veriﬁer).

(4) Easy-to-Learn: The method is familiar and is not compli-
cated to explain. Absent reported results for this metric,
we identify the set of instructions needed to commu-
nicate the authentication mechanism to a user and use
the number of instructions, plus a familiarity factor, to
rank each mechanism. For example, AugAuth has two
instructions: (1) read the shuﬄed digits, (2) enter your
PIN [79]. It is also familiar to users as a PIN. In contrast,
RubikAuth has three: (1) turn the cube to the correct face
for the ﬁrst digit of your PIN, (2) select the correct digit
on that face, (3) repeat for each digit of your PIN [56],
[57]. Since RubikAuth adds a lot of complexity to a
traditional PIN, we consider it unfamiliar and increment
the number of instructions to four. Using this method, we
deem any method with zero or one instruction as Easy-to-
Learn. Any method with two instructions is quasi-Easy-
to-Learn. Though we recognize that this is a subjective
process, we believe our results are internally consistent
and thus provide a valid way to compare mechanisms on
this criterion.
(5) Nothing-to-Carry: Users do not need to carry an addi-
tional physical object (electronic device, mechanical key,
piece of paper) to use the scheme. For example, a scheme
that requires the use of electrodes is not nothing-to-carry.
A scheme is quasi-Nothing-to-Carry if the object is one
that they’d carry everywhere all the time anyway, such
as their mobile phone, but not if it’s their computer
(including tablets).
Infrequent-Errors: The task that users must perform to
log in usually succeeds when performed by a legitimate
and honest user. In other words, the scheme isn’t so
hard to use or unreliable that genuine users are routinely
rejected. This refers to both entry accuracy (for non-
biometric methods) and model accuracy (for biomet-
ric methods). Speciﬁcally, we require 98% accuracy or
above (or ≤1% EER). A scheme is quasi-Infrequent-
Errors if accuracy is at least 90% (or EER is ≤5%).
(6)
(7) Acceptable-in-Public: A majority of users would feel
comfortable using the scheme in any public place. The
scheme therefore must not require large, visible actions
or speaking. If the scheme only requires gestures the user
would already do to interact with the device (like Glass
commands), that also fulﬁlls this criterion. A method is
quasi-Acceptable-in-Public if the scheme requires only
small, discrete gestures, such as placing a ﬁnger on the
smart glasses frame or nodding one’s head. Alternatively,
the scheme requires gestures that would be completely
acceptable in some situations, but not in others (e.g.
(1) Accessible-Visual: The method does not require a user
to be able to see or the use of eye biometrics. A
scheme is quasi-Accessible-Visual if the scheme uses eye
biometrics, but does not require the user to be able to see.
walking).
Accessibility criteria.
(2) Accessible-Hearing: The method does not require a user
to hear.
(3) Accessible-Speech: The method does not require a user
to speak.
(4) Accessible-Mobility: The method does not require phys-
ical movements, besides speech. A scheme is quasi-
Accessible-Mobility if the method requires only blinking
or requires actions the user would already be doing
to interact with the device (e.g. typical Google Glass
interactions).
(5) Accessible-Cognitive: The method does not require the
user to memorize a secret. The method is also either
completely passive or requires only movement that the
user is likely to already be doing.
Security & privacy criteria.
(1) Resilient-to-Guessing For knowledge-based methods, we
consider the password space of the method. A password
space equivalent to a four-digit PIN is not Resilient-to-
Guessing, but a more complex password space is, as
long as users choose from the entire space. For biometric
methods, we consider the false accept rate (FAR) or the
success rate of statistical attacks, whichever is reported.
The FAR must be 5% or less for a method to be quasi-
Resilient-to-Guessing, and it must be at most 1% to be
fully Resilient-to-Guessing. If neither FAR nor statistical
attack success rate is reported, we default to the same
value as Infrequent-Errors.
(2) Resilient-to-Physical-Observation: The method does not
require the use of gestures which would be visible to
observers. A method can also fulﬁll the criterion if it
uses visible gestures but proves that gestures are resilient
to physical observation (i.e., the attack success rate is
less than 1%, or less than 5% to be quasi-Resilient-to-
Physical-Observation).
(3) Protects-User-Privacy: The scheme does not utilize any
sensitive user data, i.e. biometric measurements. (Pass-
words are not considered sensitive user data.) We con-
sider a scheme quasi-Protects-User-Privacy if it uses
sensitive user data only locally on the device, or if it
is promoted as a cancelable biometric.
(4) Multi-Factor: The
scheme
involves multiple
fac-
tors/authentication layers by design (e.g., a user entered
PIN is combined with hand movement biometrics in
RubikBiom). This includes biometrics from diﬀerent
body parts (e.g. head movement and hand movement).
