### Appendix B: Additional Details of User Study

**Figure 5** presents demographic information about the participants. **Figure 6** details the popularity of each AR and VR device and the reasons for their use. **Figure 7** shows the number of participants who have experience with different authentication methods on AR and VR devices.

**Authentication Methods Experience:**

| Authentication Method | AR Users | VR Users |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|
| Password              | 17       | 75       |
| Unlock Pattern        | 4        | 7        |
| Iris Scan             | 6        | 0        |
| Paired Device         | 8        | 28       |
| Paired Account        | 3        | 38       |

### Appendix C: Publication Venues Considered

Using Google Scholar metrics, we gathered top venues in the following subcategories: Computer Security & Cryptography, Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition, Signal Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Engineering & Computer Science (general). We considered the top 20 venues in each subcategory, supplemented by venues from CSRankings under Computer Vision, Computer Security, Mobile Computing, and Human-Computer Interaction. Workshops were excluded, resulting in a total of 102 top venues.

**Keywords Used:**
- For authentication: "authentication", "authenticate", "authenticating", "authenticated", "user identification", "password", "biometric".
- For AR and VR: "virtual reality", "augmented reality", "mixed reality", "smart glasses", "smartglasses", "head-mounted displays", "head-worn display".

### Appendix D: Definitions of Evaluation Criteria

**Figure 8** outlines the criteria used for evaluation and the reasons for their inclusion.

**Deployment Criteria:**
1. **OS-Supported:** The method is built into the SDK or available with minimal effort.
2. **Platform-Agnostic:** The method can be used on a computer or smartphone without additional hardware.
3. **Mature:** The scheme has been implemented and deployed on a large scale beyond research.
4. **Low-Power-Consumption:** The method does not perform signal processing or has a negligible effect on battery life.

**Usability Criteria:**
1. **Efficient-to-Use:** The authentication process is nearly instantaneous.
2. **Physically-Effortless:** The process does not require explicit physical actions.
3. **Memorywise-Effortless:** Users do not need to remember any secrets.
4. **Easy-to-Learn:** The method is familiar and simple to explain.
5. **Nothing-to-Carry:** No additional physical object is required.
6. **Infrequent-Errors:** The method has high accuracy (≥98% or ≤1% EER).
7. **Acceptable-in-Public:** Users feel comfortable using the method in public.

**Accessibility Criteria:**
1. **Accessible-Visual:** The method does not require vision or eye biometrics.
2. **Accessible-Hearing:** The method does not require hearing.
3. **Accessible-Speech:** The method does not require speaking.
4. **Accessible-Mobility:** The method does not require physical movements.
5. **Accessible-Cognitive:** The method does not require memorizing secrets.

**Security & Privacy Criteria:**
1. **Resilient-to-Guessing:** The method has a strong password space or low false accept rate (≤5% FAR).
2. **Resilient-to-Physical-Observation:** The method is resistant to observation (≤1% attack success rate).
3. **Protects-User-Privacy:** The method does not use sensitive user data.
4. **Multi-Factor:** The method involves multiple authentication layers.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive and consistent evaluation of AR and VR authentication methods.
