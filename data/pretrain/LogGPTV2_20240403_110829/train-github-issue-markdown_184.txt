I have an electron project that I compile using gulp-tsb in one pass. Some
files reference github-electron-renderer.d.ts and others reference github-
electron-main.d.ts. Unfortunately, the duplicate definition of ipc causes some
errors which takes away from the advantage of having a d.ts to begin with.
Has anyone else seen this issue?
