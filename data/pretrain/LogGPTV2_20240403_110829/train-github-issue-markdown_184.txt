I am working on an Electron project and using `gulp-tsb` to compile the TypeScript code in a single pass. Some of my files reference `github-electron-renderer.d.ts`, while others reference `github-electron-main.d.ts`. Unfortunately, the duplicate definition of `ipc` in these declaration files is causing some compilation errors, which undermines the benefits of using `.d.ts` files in the first place.

Has anyone else encountered this issue, and if so, how did you resolve it?
