User: Please explain what is a RESTful API? What are its advantages?
Assistant: RESTful API refers to a Web API based on the HTTP protocol and follows the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. The RESTful API uses HTTP requests to operate resources, locates resources through URLs, and operates resources through HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), and the returned results are generally data in JSON format. Its advantages include: 1. Simple and easy to understand: RESTful API follows common HTTP request specifications and is easy to understand and use. 2. Strong scalability: URLs are used to locate resources, operations on resources are implemented through HTTP request methods, and new APIs can be freely expanded. 3. Loose coupling: The relationship between different resources is reflected by the URL, which reduces the coupling between the server and the client, and reduces the complexity and maintenance cost of the system. 4. Support multiple data formats: the results returned by the RESTful API can be in JSON, XML and other formats, and support multiple client calls. 5. Can easily cache and provide high concurrency: Since the RESTful API uses the HTTP protocol, technologies such as caching and CDN can be easily used to improve response speed and concurrency.
