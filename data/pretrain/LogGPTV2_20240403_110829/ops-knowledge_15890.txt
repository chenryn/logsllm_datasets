User: What are EC2 instances and S3 storage in AWS? How to use them to achieve highly available and scalable application architecture?
Assistant: An AWS EC2 instance is a virtual machine in cloud computing on which users can run different operating systems and applications. EC2 instances can flexibly adjust computing power and storage capacity according to user needs. AWS S3 storage is an object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve considerable amounts of data objects in a secure, highly available, scalable, and economical manner. To achieve a highly available and scalable application architecture, users can place applications on multiple EC2 instances and use automatic scaling and load balancing to achieve automatic horizontal expansion. In addition, users can use S3 storage to store static files and assets to offload EC2 instances and ensure high availability of data. By combining S3 and EC2 and using various services provided by AWS (such as Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, etc.), users can achieve high-performance, reliable and scalable application architecture.
