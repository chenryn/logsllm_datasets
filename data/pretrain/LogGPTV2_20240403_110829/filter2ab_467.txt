### Title: Stuxnet-in-a-Box: In-Field Emulation and Fuzzing of PLCs to Uncover the Next Zero-Day Threat in Industrial Control Systems

In recent years, the field of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security has seen significant developments, with numerous high-profile attacks highlighting the lack of a design-for-security initiative in ICS. Concurrently, a substantial body of research has emerged, aiming to proactively uncover underlying vulnerabilities. The primary focus of both attackers and researchers has been on the network level, as it serves as the main gateway to an ICS, and on the control operations performed by these systems.

As ICS evolve, the control logic is increasingly abstracted to a purely software level, hosted on generic operating systems. This abstraction makes software-level evaluation of multiple layers within an ICS a logical and straightforward approach. In this work, we introduce a new tool for the cybersecurity assessment of ICS, specifically Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), enabling in-field security evaluations without disrupting the actual process.

Our tool leverages system emulation to eliminate the need for direct experiments on the actual hardware, significantly improving scalability and compatibility for easy deployment across various platforms. On the emulated platform, we apply fuzzing techniques to different software levels, including the device firmware, the system itself, the hosted PLC abstraction layer, and the application performing the control logic. Through fuzzing, we aim to expose vulnerabilities that may arise from poor maintenance or sloppy programming.

For our PLC platform, we have chosen the Codesys runtime, an industry-leading solution used in approximately 25% of currently deployed PLCs. Additionally, we will integrate the knowledge of uncovered vulnerabilities with a custom reverse engineering tool to dynamically synthesize a new cyber threat. This synthesized threat will incorporate operational manipulation, system exploitation, and stealth, making it a Stuxnet-level threat to ICS.

By combining advanced emulation, fuzzing, and reverse engineering, our approach aims to proactively identify and mitigate potential zero-day threats in industrial control systems, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of critical infrastructure.
