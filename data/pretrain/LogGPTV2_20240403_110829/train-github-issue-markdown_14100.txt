### Describe the workflow you want to enable
As a user who specify weighted metrics/scoring such as balanced accuracy, I
would like the scoring `GridSearchCV` uses for optimising and `best_score_` to
be weighted as well. Based on current documentation, I think it is currently
simply a mean, so I do not aware if this has been tackled/asked before.
I am thinking about this since my data is imbalanced, and saw this post in SO
too.
The mean seems to work fine when `StratifiedKFold` with minority class is
multiple of `K`. If not (where the number minority class in each fold can be
different) the scoring could be different with the 'combined scoring'.
However, this is not as severe as doing this in `LeaveOneOut`.
### Describe your proposed solution
When the user specify built-in weighted scoring, record the validation results
for all folds and calculate scoring from combined validation result.
This can be default behavior or an option to turn this on/off. However, I
couldn't see why people who specify weighted metrics want to turn this off.
