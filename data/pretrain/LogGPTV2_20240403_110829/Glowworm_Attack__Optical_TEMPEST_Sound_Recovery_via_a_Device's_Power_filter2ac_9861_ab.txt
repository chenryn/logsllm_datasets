today (e.g., Lamphone [54]), or (4) specialized equipment for spy-
ing [53], a fact that may limit their availability in some countries
(limiting the sale of such equipment to, e.g., police departments).
3 Threat Model
In this section, we describe the threat model and explain its sig-
nificance with respect to other methods. The Glowworm attack
targets the speech of participants in virtual meeting platforms (e.g.,
Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, Microsoft Teams). During the COVID-
19 pandemic, these platforms became a popular way for people to
meet and share information; personal and valuable information is
routinely exchanged when these platforms are used for personal
and business meetings.
We assume that an individual is located inside a room or office
and using his/her computer to conduct a virtual meeting with
another person (or a group) using a virtual meeting platform. The
purpose of the conversation can vary, for example, the individuals
may want to discuss business (e.g., sharing something with a client
or colleague) or something of a personal nature (e.g., talking about
medical test results with a doctor).
We consider an eavesdropper that is a malicious entity interested
in recovering speech from meetings and using the valuable infor-
mation discussed in the meeting for a malicious purpose that may
include spying on individuals (e.g., to obtain sensitive information
that can be used for blackmail) or spying on an organizations (e.g.,
to obtain a company‚Äôs IP and use it to give a competitor an advan-
tage). We assume the eavesdropper is located within 35 meters of
the target room. The eavesdropper can be: (1) a person located in
a room in an adjacent building, (2) a person in a nearby car. We
consider this threat as highly probable in the COVID-19 era due
to the number of personal and business meetings being held in
unsecured settings, including home offices.
In order to recover the sound in this scenario, the eavesdrop-
per performs the Glowworm attack. We assume that the a power
indicator LED of a vulnerable device is visible from outside the
room/office. We consider two types of attacks: (1) a direct attack,
where the eavesdropper recovers sound from the power indicator
LED of the speakers, and (2) an indirect attack, where the eaves-
dropper recovers sound from the power indicator LED of the device
used to provide the power to the speakers (e.g., a connected USB
hub, a microcontroller). Note that the Glowworm attack can be
applied by eavesdroppers to recover: (1) the speech of any person
speaking to the victim during a virtual meeting, and (2) any sound
(e.g., music from YouTube, videos from the Internet) that is played
by the speakers during the virtual meeting, which may or may not

be related to the meeting; in this paper, we present the attack in
the context of recovering speech from a virtual meeting.
The main components used to perform the Glowworm attack
are: (1) A telescope - This piece of equipment is used to focus the
field of view on a device‚Äôs power indicator LED from a distance. (2)
An electro-optical sensor - This sensor is mounted on the telescope
and consists of a photodiode that converts light into an electrical
current; the current is generated when photons are absorbed in the
photodiode. (3) A sound recovery system - This system receives an
optical signal as input and outputs the recovered acoustic signal.
The eavesdropper can implement such a system with: (a) dedicated
hardware (e.g., using capacitors, resistors), or (b) the use of ADC
to sample the electro-optical sensor and process the data using a
sound recovery algorithm running on a laptop. In this study, we
use the latter digital approach.
Fig. 1 outlines the threat model: The sound ùë†ùëõùëë(ùë°) played by the
speakers in the victim‚Äôs room results in changes in the power con-
sumption due to the direct connection of the power indicator LED
to the input power line and the device‚Äôs lack of voltage stabilizers.
These changes in power consumption influence the intensity of the
light produced by the device‚Äôs power indicator LED, resulting in a
pattern of changes over time that the eavesdropper measures with
an optical sensor which is directed at a device‚Äôs power indicator
LED via a telescope. The analog output of the electro-optical sen-
sor is sampled by the ADC to a digital optical signal ùëúùëùùë°(ùë°). The
eavesdropper then processes the optical signal ùëúùëùùë°(ùë°), using an
optical-audio transformation, to an acoustic signal ùë†ùëõùëë‚àó(ùë°).
In order to keep the digital processing as light as possible in terms
of computation, we sample the electro-optical sensor with the ADC
set at the minimal sampling frequency allowing comprehensible
audio recovery; Glowworm is aimed at recovering speech, and
this requires a sufficient sampling frequency rate. The spectrum
of speech covers quite a wide portion of the audible frequency
spectrum. Speech consists of vowel and consonant sounds; the
vowel sounds and the cavities that contribute to the formation of the
different vowels range from 85 to 180 Hz for a typical adult male and
from 165 to 255 Hz for a typical adult female. In terms of frequency,
the consonant sounds are above 500 Hz (more specifically, in the 2-4
KHz frequency range) [2]. As a result, a telephone system samples
an audio signal at 8 KHz. However, many studies have shown that an
even lower sampling rate is sufficient for recovering comprehensible
sound (e.g., 2200 Hz for the visual microphone [24]). In this study,
we sample the electro-optical sensor at a sampling rate of 4/8 KHz.
The significance of Glowworm‚Äôs threat model with respect to
related work is that Glowworm is:
(1) Not dependent on the distance between a sound source and
a nearby object: Glowworm analyzes the intensity of a device‚Äôs
power indicator LED, which is affected by a device‚Äôs power con-
sumption. As a result, the attack is not limited based on the required
distance between a sound source and a nearby lightweight object
(diaphragm) that vibrates in response to sound (as opposed to other
sound recovery methods that are limited in that there can be no
more than one meter between the sound source and a vibrating
object [13, 15, 24, 43, 51, 53, 54, 61, 62, 68, 70, 73]).
(2) External: Glowworm does not rely on compromising a device
to obtain the data needed to recover sound (as opposed to other
sound recovery methods that require eavesdroppers to compromise
a device with malware first [13, 32, 43, 51, 61, 73]).
(3) Passive and relies on a benign sensor: The method relies
on a passive electro-optical sensor that is not considered spying
equipment and gives no indication regarding its application (as
opposed to the laser microphone [53] in which a laser beam is
directed at a glass window).
(4) Capable of recovering speech without the need to compile
a dictionary: Glowworm can be used to recover any speech (as
opposed to other methods that are limited to classifying isolated
words contained in a precompiled dictionary [13, 51, 68, 73]).
(5) Not dependent on being withing hearing range: Glowworm
can be applied by eavesdroppers that are located beyond hearing
range, from a distance of 15-35 meters (as opposed to other methods
that require the eavesdropper to be located within 15 meters of the
victim [23, 24]).
(6) Capable of recovering speech at a virtual meeting‚Äôs sound
level of 70 dB (in contrast to other methods that can only be used
to recover sound at a high volume [24, 43, 54]).
4 Analysis
In this section, we describe the series of experiments performed to
evaluate the risk of optical sound recovery posed by the vulnerabil-
ity of the power indicator LED of various devices. The experiments
analyze: (1) the influence of sound played from speakers on the
power consumption of various devices, (2) the response of the de-
vice‚Äôs power indicator LED to sound, and (3) the side effects added

to the optical signal which are not the result of sound played from
the speakers.
The devices used in these experiments are: Logitech S120 speak-
ers [5], Winner speakers [11], a TP-Link UE330 USB hub splitter
[10], a MIRACASE MHUB500 USB hub splitter [6], a Raspberry Pi
(RP) 4, a Google Nest Mini [3], and Creative Pebble speakers [1].
Four of the devices are presented in Fig. 2.
The experiments were conducted as follows: An electro-optical
sensor (the Thorlabs PDA100A2 [9], which is an amplified switch-
able gain light sensor that consists of a photodiode which is used
to convert light/photons to electrical voltage) was directed at the
power indicator LED of each device. The voltage was obtained from
the electro-optical sensor using a 24-bit ADC NI-9234 card [8] and
processed in a LabVIEW script that we wrote. The internal gain
of the electro-optical sensor was set at the highest level before
reaching saturation. The setup is presented in Fig. 2.
4.1 Understanding How Played Sound Affects
the Power Consumption
Here we explore the effect of played sound on a device‚Äôs power
consumption and show that it linearly affects the device‚Äôs power
indicator LED due to the fact that hardware manufacturers do not
integrate any voltage stabilizers or filters in some products. We
show that optical measurements can be used to recover sound using
an electro-optical sensor directed at a device‚Äôs power indicator LED
and eliminate any other reasonable side effects that could explain
this phenomenon.
4.1.1 How Played Sound Affects a Device‚Äôs Power Consumption and
the Intensity of Its Power Indicator LED Here, we show that the
intensity of a device‚Äôs power indicator LED is highly correlated
with the device‚Äôs power consumption.
Experimental Setup: We created a USB adapter that allows us
to obtain power measurements from any device with a USB input
connector (the connector can be seen in Fig. 2). We conducted three
experiments. In the first experiment, the Logitech speakers‚Äô USB
was connected to the adapter which was connected directly to the
electricity. In the second experiment, the Logitech speakers‚Äô USB
was connected to the TP-Link USB hub splitter. The input USB
connector of the USB hub splitter was connected to the adapter
which was connected to a PC. In the third experiment, the Logitech
speakers‚Äô USB was connected to the RP. The input micro USB con-
nector of the RP was connected to the adapter which was connected
to the electricity. In all of these experiments, the audio was played
via the speakers (at 70 dB). The audio played from the speakers is a
30 second audio file that consists of a chirp function (a frequency
scan between 0-4 KHz). We obtained optical measurements via the
electro-optical sensor which was directed at the power indicator
LED of the speakers (in the first experiment), the USB hub splitter
(second experiment), and the RP (third experiment). In addition, in
each of the experiments, we obtained power measurements from
the adapter by connecting it to a BNC cable that was connected to
a 24-bit ADC NI-9234 card [8]. The ADC was used to obtain opti-
cal and electrical measurements simultaneously from each tested
device.
Results: Fig. 3 presents (1) three spectrograms extracted from the
optical signal, and (2) three spectrograms extracted from the power
signal. As can be seen, the chirp function played by the speakers
affected the power consumption of all three devices. In the case of
the RP, the frequency scan that was played by the speakers (0-4
KHz) can be spotted in the power consumption signal). In the cases
of the TP-Link USB hub splitter and Logitech speaker, a frequency
scan between 0-8 KHz can be seen in the power consumption signal
(we discuss this phenomenon later in this section). Moreover, as
shown in Fig. 3, the intensity of the power indicator LED of the
devices is perfectly correlated with the power consumed by the
devices (excluding some optical noise which will be discussed later
in the paper).
Conclusions: Based on these experiments, we concluded that: (1)
The power consumed by the three devices correlates with the sound
that the speakers play and the intensity of their power indicator
LED. (2) The manufacturers of these devices do not distort/change
the known linear response of the intensity of an LED to power
consumption [39] by integrating filters and voltage stabilizers into
the electrical circuits. (3) The power consumed by the speakers
influences the devices providing the power to the speakers (e.g.,
USB hub splitter, RP). (4) The linear correlation between the power
consumed by the device, the audio played, and the intensity of the

optical measurements obtained from a device‚Äôs visible power indi-
cator LED is the result of changes in a device‚Äôs power consumption
which linearly affect the intensity of the LED.
4.1.2 Ruling Out Other Possible Side Effects One might argue that
the optical measurements could be affected by a phenomenon un-
related to the changes in the intensity of a device‚Äôs power indicator
LED. For example, one reasonable argument is that electromagnetic
radiation emitted from the device was captured by the electro-
optical sensor. Another reasonable argument is that the optical
sensor captures minuscule vibrations of the power indicator LED
caused by the device‚Äôs vibrations due to the sound waves produced
from the speakers. In order to disprove these claims, we conducted
the following set of experiments.
Experimental Setup: We placed an RP on a table and directed the
electro-optical sensor at its power indicator LED from a distance
of one meter (through a telescope with a 15 cm lens diameter). We
connected the USB cable of the Logitech speakers to the RP which
was connected to the electricity on the other end. The speakers
were placed on a different surface than the RP in order to eliminate
any vibration resulting from the sound waves produced by the
speakers. The speakers played an audio file consisting of a chirp
function which is a frequency scan between 200-400 Hz.
We conducted the following three experiments: In the first exper-
iment, we obtained optical measurements when the electro-optical
sensor was directed at the RP, however we covered the device‚Äôs
power indicator LED with tape (to examine whether the played
signal appears in the optical measurements and rule out any effect
of EMR). In the second experiment, we attached a gyroscope (MPU-
6050 GY-521 [7]) to the RP to measure its vibrations (to examine
whether the played signal appears in the gyroscope measurements
and rule out any effect of vibration). We obtained measurements
from the gyroscope via another RP which was used to sample the
gyroscope at 1000 Hz. In the third experiment, we obtained optical
measurements when the electro-optical sensor was directed at the
RP‚Äôs power indicator LED (in order to prove that the played signal
can be identified in the optical measurements). The third experi-
ment was performed for the purpose of validation. The frequency
band tested in these experiments (200-400 Hz) was chosen, since
the maximum sampling rate our gyroscope provided was 1000 Hz,
which means that only frequencies below 500 Hz can be measured.
Results: The results are presented in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the
frequency scan appears in the spectrogram obtained from the opti-
cal measurements when a device‚Äôs power indicator LED is visible.
However, the frequency scan cannot be spotted in the spectrograms
obtained from (1) the optical measurements when a device‚Äôs power
indicator LED is covered, or (2) the gyroscope measurements in
each of the three axes.
Conclusions: Based on these experiments, we concluded that
(1) the optical measurements are not affected by electromagnetic
radiation (if they were, the frequency scan would have appeared
in the spectrogram when the power indicator LED was covered
with tape); and (2) the optical measurements are not affected by
the vibration caused by the sound waves produced from the speak-
ers (if they were, the frequency scan would have appeared in the
spectrograms obtained from the gyroscope on at least one of the
three axes). These experiments prove that the frequency scan in the
