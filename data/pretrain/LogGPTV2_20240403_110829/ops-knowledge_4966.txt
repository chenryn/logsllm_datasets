User: How do I get the name of a running Python script?
I tried os.__file__ but that returns the name of the file where os resides.
Assistant: It depends on what you mean by "a running python script".
__file__ will give you the name of the currently executing file. If that's a module, you'll get where it was imported from e.g. blahblah.pyc
sys.argv[0] will give you the name of the script that is being run, even if called from a module that that script imported.
Please do look up the answers to the earlier question on this topic (see S.Lott's comment on your question).
