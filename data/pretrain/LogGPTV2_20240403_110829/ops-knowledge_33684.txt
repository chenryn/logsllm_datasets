User: I`m implementing a custom filesystem on Ubuntu using Fuse, but I need to trap when a copy or move operation occur. Right now all I see are when some file are opened for writing or reading, but I need to see these operations in context so I can see what file are being copied or moved.
Any hints?
Assistant: Copy is as Weholt said: difficult to trap because it is basically the same as creating a new file and writing to it.
Move is the same operation as a rename.
