The right side of topbar stops functioning properly when you shrink the size
of the screen under the min-width. This is observable in both the app and
fluid layout if you shrink the screen size.
This is due to the position fixed of the topbar forcing it to be anchored to
the top right. I tried looking to see if there was a way to support the min-
width, but this does not seem possible without javascript usage. That said the
UX should not break under these conditions. Simply adding something like the
code below will prevent this, but it's not a bulletproof solution.
.topbar .container {  
width: auto;  
max-width: 940px;  
}  
.topbar .container-fluid {  
min-width: 0px;  
}
