2. **Session Expirations:**
   - At 11:01:06, the ZooKeeperServer expired a session (session ID: 0x34edfaa9c220022) due to a timeout of 10,000ms.
   - At 11:01:08, another session (session ID: 0x14edfaa86f6002a) was expired for the same reason.
   - At 11:07:52, yet another session (session ID: 0x14edfaa86f60031) was expired due to a 10,000ms timeout.

3. **Session Terminations:**
   - At 11:01:06, the PrepRequestProcessor processed session terminations for two sessions with IDs 0x14edfaa86f6002d and 0x24edfaa8717002d.
   - At 12:57:10, the PrepRequestProcessor processed session terminations for two more sessions with IDs 0x34edfaa9c22003d and 0x14edfaa86f60047.

4. **Socket Closures:**
   - At 11:01:41, the NIOServerCnxn closed a socket connection for a client at IP address 10.10.34.13 with session ID 0x24edfaa87170022.
   - At 11:07:42, another socket connection was closed for a client at IP address 10.10.34.12 with session ID 0x24edfaa87170035.

5. **New Session Requests:**
   - At 11:01:55, a new session was attempted by a client at IP address 10.10.34.12.
   - At 11:09:03, another new session was attempted by a client at IP address 10.10.34.40.

6. **Connection Warnings:**
   - At 11:07:35 and 12:57:00, the NIOServerCnxn caught end-of-stream exceptions.
   - At 11:09:02, the ZooKeeperServer received a connection request from an old client at IP address 10.10.34.30, which would be dropped if the server was in read-only mode.

7. **Other Operational Events:**
   - At 15:31:15, the DatadirCleanupManager set the autopurge.purgeInterval to 0.
   - At 15:31:41, the QuorumCnxManager$Listener received a connection request from IP address 10.10.34.11.
   - At 15:36:21, a snapshot was taken of the version-2 directory, saved to /var/lib/zookeeper/version-2/snapshot.50000062e.
