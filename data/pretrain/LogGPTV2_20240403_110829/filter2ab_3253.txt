### Title: Black Hat EU-20: Effective Vulnerability Discovery with Machine Learning

**Abstract:**

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies by comparing the libraries detected in an application against a database of known vulnerabilities. These databases typically aggregate information from multiple sources, including bug tracking systems, source code commits, and mailing lists, and are curated by security researchers to ensure accuracy.

We have designed and implemented a machine learning system that encompasses a complete pipeline, from data collection and model training to prediction and validation of new models before deployment. This process is executed iteratively to generate increasingly accurate models with updated labels, and it incorporates self-training to automatically expand the training dataset.

The deployed model automatically predicts the vulnerability-relatedness of each data item, enabling effective discovery of vulnerabilities across the open-source library ecosystem. To ensure performance stability, our methodology includes an additional evaluation step to assess the new model's performance. Specifically, this evaluation measures the agreement between the new and old models while aiming to improve metrics such as precision and recall.

This study, which is the first of its kind to leverage a variety of data sources, was recently recognized with the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at the Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR) 2020.

**Key Points:**
1. **Data Aggregation and Curation:** SCA tools rely on curated databases of known vulnerabilities, sourced from various repositories.
2. **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Our system includes a comprehensive pipeline for data collection, model training, and iterative improvement.
3. **Self-Training and Data Expansion:** The system uses self-training to automatically increase the size of the training dataset, enhancing model accuracy.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** An additional evaluation step ensures the new model's performance and agreement with the previous model, focusing on precision and recall.
5. **Recognition and Impact:** The study was awarded the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at MSR 2020, highlighting its significance in the field.

By leveraging this machine learning approach, we can more effectively and accurately discover vulnerabilities in open-source libraries, contributing to the overall security of software applications.
