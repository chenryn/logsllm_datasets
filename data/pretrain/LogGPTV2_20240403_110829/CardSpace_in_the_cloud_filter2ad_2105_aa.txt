ABSTRACT 
This paper describes a web based federated identity management 
system  which  is  based  on  the  user  centric  approach  of  the 
Information Card model, and has been enhanced to remove many 
of 
in  Microsoft’s  original  design. 
Furthermore the new design is adapted to interwork with existing 
SAML 2 federations. Our model supports not only improved user 
mobility  and  the  aggregation  of  claims  from  multiple  identity 
providers (IdPs), but also user authentication via just one of the 
IdPs  without  placing  any  constraints  on  the  authentication 
mechanism  that  is  used.  This  is  achieved  by  introducing  a  new 
component, the Linking Identity Selector, which allows the user 
to select multiple cards at service provision time. Users can then 
use the combined set of credentials to access a wider range of web 
based resources. We describe our first example application which 
allows  the  user  to  present  a  credit  card,  a  self  asserted  card,  a 
hotel loyalty card and a frequent flyer card in order to make an 
online hotel booking, using voice biometrics for authentication.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Information cards are a core component of Microsoft’s Cardspace 
identity management and authorisation system. A good high level 
overview  of  CardSpace  can  be  found  in  [1].  Each  information 
card is a partial representation of a user’s online digital identity 
and  the  full  set  of  cards  is  a  representation  of  the  user’s  entire 
digital identity. Information Cards have some excellent features in 
terms  of  usability  and  security.  From  a  usability  perspective 
InfoCards provide a metaphor that is familiar to users i.e. that of 
plastic  cards  in  a  wallet.  The  simple  clicking  of  a  card

simultaneously provides user consent and submission to a service 
provider (SP). Cards may be self issued or managed, meaning that 
the  claims  originate  from  either  the  user  herself  or  an  Identity 
Provider  (IdP).  From  a  security  perspective  they  significantly 
reduce  the  risk  from  phishing  attacks,  they  provide  privacy 
protection of the user’s personal information, and good assurance 
to the service provider (SP) that the user does have the attributes 
or claims that are being asserted.  Unfortunately the model suffers 
from  a  number  of  significant  disadvantages.  CardSpace  only 
supports a limited number of authentication mechanisms with an 
IdP (un/pw, X.509 certificate and Kerberos V5) and adding new 
mechanisms  such  as  voice  biometrics  or  one-time  passwords  is 
impossible without significant changes to the protocol flows.  The 
user’s  cards  are  held  in  a  fat  client  on  the  desktop  (the  Identity 
Selector) which constrains mobility and limits the choice of end 
user devices. Furthermore, Cardspace only allows a single card to 
be used in each transaction. This is a serious limitation, since in 
the  physical  world  of  plastic  cards,  users  typically  have  lots  of 
cards  issued  by  many  different  IdPs,  with  each  card  typically 
holding  only  one  (or  very  few)  user  attribute(s),  along  with  its 
validity period, a user identifier, a mechanism to authenticate the 
user  (usually  a  signature  or  PIN,  but  could  be  a  photograph  as 
well), and details of the issuer. Other contents such as holograms 
and chips are there to ensure the authenticity of the physical card 
and the attribute assertion (or claim) that it makes. They do not 
provide  additional  attributes  of  the  user.  Thus  as  federated 
identity management systems expand to Internet scale, users will 
need  to  aggregate  their  attributes  from  multiple  IdPs.    In  the 
InfoCard model this means that users will need to be able to select 
and use multiple cards in a single transaction. 
By  way  of  a  motivating  example,  we  present  the  use-case  of  a 
user wishing to make an online hotel booking, in which she needs 
to  prove  she  has  a  valid  credit  card,  she  wishes  to  present  her 
hotel loyalty card to get a free room upgrade, her frequent flyer 
card to score air miles, and her current name and address (which 
are  different  to  those  registered  with  the  various  card  holders). 
Furthermore, the user does not wish to have to remember lots of 
usernames and passwords, and because she is sending her credit 
card  details,  she  wants  to  use  her  credit  card  IdP  which  uses 
strong authentication. In our case the credit card IdP offers voice 
biometrics to authenticate her. It also offers the protection option 
of  not  revealing  her  credit  card  details  to  the  hotel,  but  instead 
sending  it  an  assertion  with  a  session  identifier  confirming  that 
the  user  holds  a  valid  credit  card,  and  that  payments  can  be 
charged to the session id.

Our  model  assumes  that  the  user  is the only person who knows 
about  all  of  her  managed  cards  (i.e.  IdP  accounts),  and  that  she 
does  not wish any IdP to know about all of her other accounts.  
This mirrors real life today. We further assume that all IdPs and 
SPs  are  part  of  a  pre-existing  federation  structure  with  pre-
existing trust relationships between them. We introduce a new SP 
into the federation, called a Linking Identity Selector (LIS). The 
LIS holds links to the user’s various IdP accounts, and allows the 
user to select multiple cards (IdPs) at service provision time. The 
LIS helps to protect the privacy of the user since the IdPs link to 
the  LIS  instead  of  to  each  other.  Furthermore  the  LIS  does  not 
have any knowledge of who the user actually is or what attributes 
are held by each individual IdP, except for those attribute types 
(but not values) that the user chooses to release to the LIS when 
she links her accounts together. The user is free to choose any LIS 
in the federation and is not bound to any single provider. The user 
may have different accounts at multiple LISs if desired. Each LIS 
is  trusted  by  the  IdPs  and  SPs  to  hold  the  user’s  account 
information confidentially and securely and to only release details 
back  to  their  respective  IdPs  and  to  SPs  when  requested  by  the 
user. 
2.1  IdP/Card Registration 
We  introduce  a  pared  down  InfoCard  schema  that  contains  no 
personal  data,  only  the  picture/logo  and  name  of  the  IdP  along 
with  the  metadata  needed  to  access  it.  The  advantage  of  this 
design is that a single InfoCard is valid for all users, and cards 
can be made publically available. If they are intercepted or lost 
they  don’t  affect  the  user’s  privacy  (unlike  current  InfoCards). 
We further propose that each IdP hosts an InfoCard well known 
address  e.g.  http://idp.com/InfoCard/  where  users  can  obtain 
cards.  This  removes  a  current  limitation  of  today’s  managed 
cards, i.e. no-one knows how or where to get them.  When a user 
wishes  to  retrieve  an InfoCard as a file she can navigate to this 
well known address using any browser and download it to her PC. 
Since our Identity Selector runs in the cloud, there is no reason 
for users to need to import and export their cards as they move 
between devices, as with current InfoCards, since all their devices 
can  contact  the  LIS  in  the  cloud.  Users  access  the  LIS  with  a 
normal web browser and a simple new plug-in module, which is 
advantageous  to  using  the  thick  client  of  current  CardSpace 
systems.  
The user may upload one of her InfoCard files to the LIS, or the 
LIS  may  already  hold  cards  for  all  the  IdPs  in  the  federation. 
Once  the  LIS  knows  which  card  the  user  wishes  to  use,  it  will 
redirect the user to the authentication service of that IdP, using the 
metadata  on 
to 
login/authenticate  using  any  mechanism  it  chooses.  We  thus 
devolve  the  act  of  authentication  from  the  identity  selector, 
thereby  freeing  the  IdPs  to  use  any  authentication  mechanisms 
they  wish.  In  the  pilot  scheme  we  are  constructing,  our  Credit 
Card  IdP,  run  by  Voice  Commerce  Group,  will  be  using  voice 
biometrics to authenticate users.  We use the standard SAMLv2 
protocol [2] for interactions between the user’s browser, the LIS 
(acting  as  SP)  and  the  IdP,  although  an  alternative  protocol 
mapping could be devised if desired.  
The  LIS  requests  an  authentication  and  attribute  token  from  the 
IdP, which should contain a random but persistent identifier (PId) 
the  card.  This  will  prompt 
the  user 
for this user. This PId is used as a pair-wise secret between the LS 
and the IdP to identify the user’s account at either end in all future 
communications between the two parties. After authenticating the 
user,  the  IdP  asks  the  user  which  attribute  types  she  wants  to 
include  in  her  linked  card  at  the  LIS,  and  includes  these  in  the 
response.  When  the  LIS  receives  an  unknown  PId,  it  creates  a
