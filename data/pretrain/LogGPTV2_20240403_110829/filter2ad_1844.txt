## Abstract
The proliferation of interconnected embedded systems has transformed the vision of pervasive computing into a reality, now commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). With this development, embedded security has become a critical concern across a wide range of applications. This tutorial will explore both the constructive and destructive aspects of embedded security in the IoT.

### Keywords
Security, embedded security, Internet of Things, implementation attacks

## Introduction
The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about a new era of interconnected embedded systems, making pervasive computing a tangible reality. This evolution has also highlighted the importance of embedded security, which is now a crucial aspect in numerous applications. Examples include the Stuxnet virus, which reportedly delayed Iran's nuclear program, and consumer applications like iTunes and Amazon’s Kindle, whose business models rely on intellectual property protection. Additionally, medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, which can be remotely configured, underscore the dual nature of embedded security—both its constructive and destructive potentials.

In this tutorial, we will address both the constructive and "penetration testing" aspects of embedded security. We will focus on implementation attacks, also known as physical attacks, which are particularly significant in the context of embedded devices. Unlike network-based attacks, physical attacks exploit the physical environment of an application. For example, an attacker can monitor a device's power or timing behavior, or induce malfunctions through power spikes, and extract information from faulty outputs. Many otherwise secure systems become vulnerable to these implementation attacks.

### Destructive Aspects: Implementation Attacks
Implementation attacks, specifically side-channel attacks (SCA), are among the most potent methods in the realm of physical attacks. Differential Power Analysis (DPA) is a prominent technique within SCA. We will delve into the mechanics of DPA and examine recent case studies where real-world implementations were compromised using SCA. These include successful attacks against contactless smart cards and FPGAs.

### Constructive Aspects: Lightweight Cryptography
On the constructive side, we will explore the field of lightweight cryptography, which aims to provide security at the lowest possible cost, measured in terms of power consumption, code size, or chip area. Over the past six years, this has become a highly active area within symmetric cryptography. Notably, the NSA recently released two lightweight ciphers, SIMON and SPECK. We will discuss the motivations behind such ciphers, particularly for applications like passive RFID tags and anti-counterfeiting, and compare them with existing standards like AES.

## Conclusion
Embedded security in the IoT presents both challenges and opportunities. By understanding and addressing the destructive and constructive aspects, we can enhance the security and reliability of embedded systems, thereby ensuring the integrity and safety of the IoT ecosystem.
