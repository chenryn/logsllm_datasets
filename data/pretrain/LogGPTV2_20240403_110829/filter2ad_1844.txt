phers, e.g., for passive RFID tags or anti-counterfeiting ap-
plications. We will then introduce several lightweight con-
structions and will compare them with AES.

Through the prevalence of interconnected embedded sys-
tems, the vision of pervasive computing has become reality
over the last few years. More recently, this evolutionary
development has become better known as the Internet of
Things. As part of this development, embedded security
has become an increasingly important issue in a multitude
of applications. Examples include the Stuxnet virus, which
has allegedly delayed the Iranian nuclear program, killer ap-
plications in the consumer area like iTunes or Amazon’s Kin-
dle (the business models of which rely on IP protection) and
even medical implants like pace makers and insulin pumps
that allow remote conﬁguration. These examples show the
destructive and constructive aspects of modern embedded
security. In this tutorial we will address both the construc-
tive and “penetration testing” aspect of embedded security.
In the area of destructive embedded security implemen-
tation attacks, also known as physical attacks, are of cru-
cial importance. Whereas a network-borne attacker usu-
ally can’t exploit the physical environment of an applica-
tion, embedded devices often allow this. For instance, an
attacker can monitor the power or timing behavior of a de-
vice. Also she can force the device to malfunction, e.g.,
through power spikes, and deduct information from faulty
outputs. Many systems which are otherwise secure become
vulnerable against implementation attacks. In this talk, we
will focus on side-channel attacks, or SCA, which form ar-
guably the most powerful method among physical attacks.
After developing the mechanics of DPA (diﬀerential power
analysis), we will look at recent case studies in which real-
world implementation were broken using SCA. This includes
successful attacks against contactless smart cards and FP-
GAs.
With respect to constructive aspects of embedded secu-
rity, we will look at the ﬁeld of lightweight cryptography.
The goal here is to provide security at the lowest possible
“cost”, e.g., measured in power consumption, code size or
chip area. Over the last six years or so, this has become a
very active area within symmetric cryptography. Very re-
cently, even NSA released two lightweight ciphers, SIMON
