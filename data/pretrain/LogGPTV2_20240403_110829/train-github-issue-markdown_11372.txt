Feature
**What is the current behavior?**  
If multiple rules match a module, I believe either the loaders are applied
serially or only loaders from the first-matched rule processes the file.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I'd like to be able to process the same module multiple times, possibly via
separate rules. This doesn't necessarily need to be asynchronous.
There was a loader that helped with this once, but it no longer appears
relevant in webpack 2/3: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/multi-loader; for
loaders like ExtractTextPlugin, no file is output.
One implementation of this might be allowing us to configure a rule to only
apply for certain entries; e.g.
    config = {
      entry: { main: 'index.js', vendor: 'vendor.js' },
      module: { rules: [ { test: (file, entry) => file === 'test.css' && entry === 'main', use: [ ... ] } ] }
    } 
Or perhaps we can just specify a rule to apply in "parallel", for any
overlapping rules.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**  
Lots of use cases for this; one might be to process a stylesheet in different
ways, and saving them as separate files via ExtractTextPlugin.
