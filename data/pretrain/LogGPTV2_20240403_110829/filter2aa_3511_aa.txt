ABSTRACT 
In this paper, the terms Digital Terrestrial Tracking (DTT) and 
Digital Terrestrial Footprint (DTF) are introduced. The DTF 
defines the uniquely identifiable signature of wireless signals 
emitted by a device or collection of devices that an individual 
carries on their person in the physical world. These signals can 
reveal a device’s history at a location and point in time, and 
potentially disclose details about the owner. Interrogation or 
interaction with the device may reveal further details.  
The DTF positions itself between an individual’s physical world 
footprint (their unique personal attributes), and their online 
footprint (defined by their unique online persona). Physical world 
tracking would involve following a person based on what they 
look or sound like; online tracking would involve tracking a 
person online activity based on their unique online signature 
(cookies, IP addresses, social media accounts); and digital 
terrestrial tracking involves tracking a person in the real world 
based on a unique signature emitted by devices on their person. 
The goal of the research conducted and discussed in this paper 
was to build a mass data collection and correlation framework 
based on information leaked from the wireless devices that people 
carry. The framework should be able to identify, track, and profile 
people by passively collected wireless information from devices, 
and collect information that is more verbose by optionally 
interrogating devices. 
The result is a tool, named Snoopy, written in Python, capable of 
operating in a distributed manner, in harsh environments on 
affordable off the shelf (OTS) hardware. Snoopy is able to draw 
specific and high level conclusions about individuals based on 
their digital wireless signals. 
The framework has been extensively tested in busy public areas 
(such as conferences, airports, hotels, etc.) and validated our 
hypothesis that such tracking was possible. Analysis performed 
against the collected data revealed interesting insights and trends, 
which will be discussed in the results section of this paper.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Mobile electronic devices such as smart phones, laptops, tablets, 
wearable computers (e.g. smart watches, fitness bracelets, etc.) 
emit wireless signals, even whilst not in active use. If the signals 
emitted by one or more of these devices are unique, the device 
(and therefore the owner) can be identified as being in a certain 
location at a certain time. The signals may also reveal personal 
information about the owner, or upon interrogation or interaction 
divulge such information. 
An example of such signals is the 802.11 wireless probe-request 
that is broadcast from mobile phones and other portable Wi-Fi 
enabled devices. These signals include a unique MAC address of 
the device, and the name (SSID) of the wireless network being 
searched for. The SSID may be able to be geo-located, or simple 
link-analysis could be conducted by identifying different devices 
searching for the same SSIDs, thus revealing secondary and even 
tertiary relationships (e.g. a spouse, or business partner).  
Active interaction with devices may also be possible. For 
example, due to a lack of verification with WEP or OPEN Wi-Fi 
networks it is possible to respond to arbitrary probe requests from 
client devices with a beacon, thereby impersonating the desired 
access point, and intercepting network traffic from client devices. 
Similar techniques work with GSM, by detecting the unique IMSI 
(international mobile subscriber identity) of a mobile phone, with 
the option of operating a personal cellular tower (small cell) to 
intercept data. Other examples include detecting the MAC address 
and device name via Bluetooth; detecting the device ID with 
RFID; reading data from an NFC device; or detecting the device 
number of an ANT fitness device. Furthermore, if carrying 
multiple devices the cloud of device signals may provide a unique 
identity even if individual devices do not. 
The Snoopy tool was originally released as a proof of concept for 
detecting, tracking, and interrogating client Wi-Fi devices [1]. 
Since then, it has been re-written to be modular with a technology 
agnostic framework able to collect signals emitted from arbitrary 
technologies as defined by its plugins. Current plugins include 
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GSM, NFC, and RFID. The framework 
is designed to run unattended for prolonged periods synchronizing 
data to a central server (via 3G modem, Xbee, or Wi-Fi). It has 
several modes of operation, including an aerial surveillance and 
tracking mode. 
Visual data exploration from a central server reveals enlightening 
patterns-of-life of individuals, both at the macro and micro levels. 
This will be discussed in the results section of the paper. 
Work has been done in this area by academics, private 
corporations, and military institutions 2-13], but at the time of 
writing Snoopy is the only open source technology agnostic DTF 
tracking and profiling framework that we know of. 
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The goal of this research was to build a framework to detect a 
user’s DTF, demonstrate how the user could be tracked via it, and 
what link analysis could be conducted against data in both a 
passive and active manner. Data collection should be in a 
distributed manner allowing for the deployment of low cost 
sensors (later named drones) over an area with data synchronised 
between sensors and servers. A degree of data protection was a 
@glennzw // DefCon 22 August 2014 
further requirement; such that a discovered sensor would not 
reveal captured information to a third party. 
Data exploration should be possible in a graphical manner, in such 
a way that operators can query data to visually discover patterns.  
Finally, the devised solution should be based upon open source 
software and off-the-shelf hardware.  
3. BACKGROUND 
In this section, we discuss several wireless technologies, their 
common deployment in consumer devices, and examine the DTF 
they may create for the user. 
3.1 Wireless Technology 
The ever decreasing cost of production, increase in computing 
power, and desire for convenience is prompting a growing number 
of wireless enabled devices to be carried by consumers. This 
includes, but is not limited to; Wi-Fi/GSM/Bluetooth enabled 
smart phones, NFC bank cards, RFID biometric passports, Wi-Fi 
enabled pacemakers, low power Bluetooth tagged ‘Internet of 
Things’ items. These technologies may disclose unique 
identifiers, or personal information concerning the owner. 
3.1.1 Wi-Fi 
Wi-Fi (or more accurately the group of IEEE wireless 802.11 
specifications) provides wireless access to networks at Open 
Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers one (radio wave 
modulation) and two (primarily media access control) of the OSI 
network stack, and is indistinguishable from a wired (Ethernet) 
connection to the user or software on layers three and up. A Wi-Fi 
network configured in infrastructure mode (i.e. a Basic Service 
Set (BSS)) describes a client device as a station, which connects 
to an access point (AP). Ad-hoc networks are also possible 
between clients, but not relevant for our discussion. A typical AP 
has a range of 35 meters indoor, and 100 meters outdoors. 
The Wi-Fi standard defines three high-level wireless frame types: 
data, management, and control.  Data packets encapsulate higher-
level data (e.g. IP packets); management packets control the 
management of the network (e.g. devices connecting to an access 
point); control packets mediate access to the shared medium, such 
as collision detection and back-off (in a similar way to Ethernet). 
frame types have different subtypes. For example, the beacon, 
probe-request, and deauthentication frames are examples of 
management frame subtypes, while Request to Send (RTS) and 
Clear to Send (CTS) are examples of control frame subtypes. 
Wi-Fi packets typically have three addresses associated with 
them: a source address, a destination address and a Basic Service 
Set ID (BSSID) address (the latter uniquely identifies an AP). 
These three packet types define the origin of a packet, where it is 
going, and which AP it should use to get there. 
Security in Wi-Fi networks is broadly defined by three possibly 
options: Open, WEP encrypted, WPA encrypted or 802.11i (aka 
WPA/2) encrypted. Open networks require no passphrase to 
connect, whilst WEP and WPA and WPA/2 networks do. 
Fundamental security concerns were discovered in the WEP 
protocol, and WPA was designed to rectify them. WPA2 further 
enhanced the security. 
Stations (client devices) associate to an AP by sending a probe-
request, which includes the station’s MAC address and the SSID 
of the desired network (alternatively, an AP may send out a 
beacon packet first). The AP responds with a probe response, after 
which security options and transfer rates are negotiated. Finally, 
the authentication process occurs (which will be dependent on the 
type of encryption in use, if any). If encryption is in use, only after 
this process will any traffic actually be encrypted (therefore it is 
trivial to intercept and/or spoof any of the association steps). 
3.1.2 Bluetooth 
Bluetooth operates in the 2.4GHz range, and is designed for 
transmitting data over short distances between mobile devices, 
and for creating Personal Area Networks (PANs). 
A Bluetooth network consists of one master device, and up to 
seven slave devices. A slave may become a master by making a 
request to the current master. The master can only communicate 
with one slave at a time, but can rapidly change which device it is 
communicating with in a round-robin fashion. 
Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a subset of Bluetooth 4.0 with a 
new protocol stack. It is designed to have very low power 
consumption and run off a coin cell.  
Bluetooth stacks are increasingly incorporated into smart phones, 
wearable technology, and a range of other low power applications. 
Examples include; the FitBit bracelet, which collects information 
such as sleep patterns and daily activity syncing results to a smart 
phone or computer via BLE; the PebbleBee, a personal item 
tagging solution which allows a user to find possessions via BLE 
(and allow other uses to locate them if lost); and iBeacon, an 
indoor positioning system that Apple calls “a new class of low-
powered, low-cost transmitters that can notify nearby iOS 7 
devices of their presence.” [16]. 
3.1.3 ANT 
ANT is a wireless sensor network technology utilizing the 2.4GHz 
spectrum. Unlike Bluetooth, which was designed for small star 
networks, ANT was designed for large-scale sensor network 
topologies (whilst still requiring low power at each node). It has 
been primarily targeted at recreation and sports, especially cycling 
performance monitoring. The devices are typically embedded into 
equipment such as cadence meters, speed monitor, and heart rate 
monitors. The collected data is typically relayed back to a smart 
phone or computer for analysis. 
3.1.4 ZigBee (Wireless Sensor Networks) 
ZigBee is a specification for a communication protocol to create 
wireless sensor networks built from small, lower power radios. 
Although devices are low power, transmit range can be very high 
(up to several kilometers). It is designed for scenarios that require 
a low data rate, prolonged battery life, and secure communication. 
Common applications include wireless meters, light switches and 
traffic management systems. It is intended to be cheaper and 
simpler than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. 
3.1.5 Cellular (GSM / UMTS) 
The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) and 
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) are 
standards to describe protocols for second (2G) and third (3G) 
cellular networks. 
When a mobile phone is turned on, it registers with the carrier 
communicating a TMSI (temporary mobile subscriber identity) 
with the nearest tower, as well as the IMSI (international mobile 
subscriber identity). The TMSI value rotates on tower switching, 
but the IMSI is constant for a device. Devices will also 
periodically update their location with the network (the familiar 
“tzzz” sound heard when a phone is near a radio). How often the 
location update occurs varies between country and provider. 
A discussion of the security measures and algorithms in use in 
cellular networks are beyond the scope of our discussion, but the 
@glennzw // DefCon 22 August 2014 
IMSI catchers have demonstrated the ease with which a cellular 
network can be impersonated. With such a device, it is possible to 
determine the uniquely identifying IMSIs of all users registering 
with it, or to convince handsets to communicate via an attacker 
controlled personal cell tower (small cell). In certain conditions, it 
is even possible to actively signal users’ handsets to instruct them 
to discontinue use encryption. 
3.1.6 NFC (Near Field Communication) 
NFC is a set of standards for establishing radio communication, 
and operates in the 13.56 MHz range. Communication involves an 
initiator and a responder, whereby the initiator generates an RF 
field to power a passive target. Targets may therefore be very 
simple devices, such as a tag, key fob, or card. The tags can store 
personal data such as credit card information, passport numbers, 
PINs, loyalty card numbers, amongst other information. 
Unlike Bluetooth, NFC operates at slower speeds but does not 
require pairing and consumes far less power. 
Whilst NFC has a theoretical maximum distance of 20cm, it has 
been demonstrated that with the right hardware NFC devices can 
be detected up to several meters away. 
3.1.7 RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Tags) 
RFID tags are devices that have unique identification information 
that can be read via an external reader. Some tags are powered by 
and read by magnetic fields (via electromagnetic induction), while 
others use a battery or collect energy from the interrogating 
electromagnet field and then passively emit microwaves or UHF 
radio waves. There are several frequencies available, with the 
discerning characteristic being the range and data transmission 
rate (from 120kHz/10cm to 3-10GHz/200m).  
The tags are used in a wide array of applications, from access 
control; to tracking of goods; to contactless payment; to machine-
readable identify documents.

The ability to track and profile consumers is of great relevance to 
the retail world. Several companies give the ability to track 
consumers both in store, between stores, and out of stores. These 
metrics are often combined with other data sources, such as credit 
card data, loyalty schemes, and stores cameras. RetailNext
