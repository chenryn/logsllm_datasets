The issue described in the title arises when a JSX line is transformed, resulting in an extra comma and right parenthesis. This can lead to incorrect JavaScript code. Hereâ€™s a more detailed explanation:

### Source JSX
```jsx
var ExampleCommaIssue = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return <div style={{ margin: '42px' }} className="test" />;
    }
});
```

### Incorrect Transformation
When this JSX is transformed, it might result in the following incorrect JavaScript code:
```javascript
React.createElement("div", {style: ({'margin':'42px'}, ), className: "test"});
```

### Correct Transformation
The correct transformation should be:
```javascript
React.createElement("div", {style: {'margin': '42px'}, className: "test"});
```

### Key Observations
- This issue only seems to occur if another attribute follows the one with the parenthesized object literal.
- The problem specifically arises due to the extra comma and right parenthesis introduced by the transformation.
- It is unclear whether arbitrary values in parentheses also cause this issue, as this was not tested.

By addressing this transformation bug, the generated JavaScript code will be syntactically correct and free of unexpected commas and parentheses.
