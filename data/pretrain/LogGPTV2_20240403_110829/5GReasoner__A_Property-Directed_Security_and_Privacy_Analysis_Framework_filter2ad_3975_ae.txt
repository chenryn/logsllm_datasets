i.e., neither apply integrity protection (NIA0) nor ciphering (NEA0).
The null integrity protection algorithm is used only for control-
plane messages and for the UE in limited service mode. A UE in
limited service mode may still be allowed to establish an emergency
session (for emergency 911 phone calls) by sending the emergency
registration request message (TS 33.501, clause: 6.7.3.6). In case the
null integrity protection algorithm is used, the ‘NULL’ ciphering
algorithm is also used.
Impact. The adversary forces the victim to use null cipher and null
integrity at the RRC and PDCP layer which allows the adversary to
see and inject any control-plane messages. In such limited service
mode, the UE may expose its SUPI in plaintext if the fake base
station sends a identity_request message as shown in Figure 12.
6.2.3 Lullaby Attack. In this attack, the adversary intermittently
forces the victim device to release the existing connection with the
legitimate network and traps the device into the idle state until the
device needs to reconnect with the network. Incessant switching
from idle to connected state requires the UE to spend its energy
on further interactions and cryptographic operations which may
cause the device to deplete its battery faster.
Adversary Assumptions. We assume that the adversary already
knows the C-RNTI [45] of the victim device. The victim device is
assumed to be connected with a fake base station or to a MitM
relay [28, 45].
Vulnerability. The base station sends the encrypted and integrity
protected rrc_reconfiguration message to the UE to reconfigure the
RRC layer connection with the UE. If the UE cannot verify the
integrity protection of rrc_reconfiguration message, it releases the
connection and moves to the idle state. In this attack, the adversary
exploits this response behavior to perform the following denial-of-
service attack.
Detection and Attack Description. We model check the MRRCadv
against the following property: If a UE is in RRC connected state
and the base station sends a rrc_reconfiguration message, it will re-
main in the RRC connected state after the reconfiguration procedure.
The MCheck provided a counterexample in which the adversary
impersonating the base station sends a rrc_reconfiguration message
with an arbitrary MAC. Upon receiving this message, the victim
UE cannot verify the integrity and thus moves to the RRC idle state
by locally/implicitly releasing the RRC connection.

but use the rrc_resume and rrc_reestablish_request messages with
arbitrary invalid MAC to achieve a similar impact on the victim UE.
Impact. This attack enables the adversary to coerce a device to
move to the RRC idle state by deleting its security context (TS 38.331,
clause 5.3.11). Later on, if the UE has any outgoing/incoming mes-
sage to be sent/received, the UE will again establish the connection
and set up the RRC layer security context. The adversary may per-
form this attack more frequently to quickly drain the battery of the
victim UE.
Incarceration with rrc_reject and rrc_release. The over-
6.2.4
arching goal of the adversary in this attack is to keep the victim
device in a connection initiation loop with the base station so that
the adversary can hold off the victim device from connecting to a
legitimate network as long as possible.
Adversary Assumptions. We assume the adversary already knows
the victim device’s C-RNTI [45] or TMSI (Attack in Section 6.3.1)
and is capable of setting up two fake base stations.
Vulnerability. When a UE is in the RRC idle state, it accepts
rrc_reject messages without integrity protection.
Attack Description. One of the fake base stations lures the victim
device to connect and send rrc_setup_request message to itself. In
response, the fake base station may reply with a non-integrity pro-
tected rrc_reject message. Since the UE is in the idle mode, it accepts
the non-integrity protected reject message. If the fake base station
sets the mobility backoff timer in the reject message, the victim waits
in the idle state for a maximum 16 seconds and tries reconnecting
with the base station. The base station can then force the victim UE
to stay in this connection establishment loop by sending the reject
messages again and again. The victim UE, however, maintains a
connection establishment fail counter on the same cell and changes
the cell selection criteria once that counter reaches the limit (e.g., 4
trials). To prevent the counter from reaching the maximum limit
on the same cell, the fake base station sends rrc_release messages
interleaving with rrc_reject message. The adversary includes the
redirected carrier information in the rrc_release message to persuade
the victim to connect with the second fake base station operating
on the redirected frequency.
Impact. By turning on/off the fake base stations one at a time, the
adversary can keep the victim device in such a malicious connection
establishment loop as long as possible.
6.3 Cross-Layer Attacks
5GReasoner’s cross-layer analysis uncovered two new attacks. In
what follows, we discuss these two new attacks.
6.3.1 Exposing Device’s TMSI and Paging Occasion. With
this attack, the adversary exploits vulnerabilities in both RRC and
NAS layers to learn victim device’s TMSI as well as the paging
occasion (i.e., the time instance or radio frame number at which
the network sends paging messages to a UE) which can then be
used to track the location of the user.
Adversary Assumptions. For this attack, we assume the adver-
sary to know the victim’s C-RNTI [45] and phone number. We also
assume that the adversary can selectively drop a message with
adv
the use of a MitM relay [28, 45] and also eavesdrop on the paging
broadcast channel of the legitimate base station.
Vulnerability The adversary exploits the specification’s design
weakness of not requiring an acknowledgment of the rrc_release
message in the RRC layer and also the paging retransmission re-
quests with the same TMSI in the NAS layer.
Detection and Attack Description. We model checkMcross−layer
against the following property extracted from TS 24.501 [4]: Paging
containing TMSI will be sent just once between two incoming service
notifications. The MCheck yields a counterexample in which the
adversary (equipped with a MitM relay) first drops the rrc_release
message sent for the victim by the legitimate base station. This
forces the victim UE not to release the RRC connection and to stay
in the RRC connected state. As a result, the network assumes that
the victim device is in IDLE mode. Now the adversary makes mul-
tiple phone calls (i.e., service notifications) to the victim’s phone
number. For each call, the network will request the base station
to broadcast paging messages containing the victim’s TMSI. Since
the idle mode paging occasion for a UE is different [3] from that
of the connected mode paging occasion, the victim UE will not re-
ceive base station’s paging message. The adversary, however, with
a paging channel sniffer will find a TMSI that appears in more than
one paging messages triggered by multiple phone calls and will
infer that as the victim’s TMSI. Since 5G proposes to compute the
idle mode paging occasion using TMSI (instead of IMSI in 4G), the
adversary can also learn victim’s paging occasion from knowing
the TMSI.
Impact. The adversary knowing the victim’s TMSI or paging oc-
casion can track the location of the device (in case of infrequent
TMSI update policy used by network operators [48] as it is left
for operators’ implementations by the standard [4]), or hijack the
paging channel to broadcast fake emergency alerts or use it as the
pre-requisite step for other attacks [28, 50].
6.3.2 Exposing Device’s I-RNTI. The adversary follows the sim-
ilar attack philosophy and exploits similar vulnerabilities to the
first cross-layer attack and learns the victim’s I-RNTI and paging
occasion for tracking the user.
Attack Description. In this attack, if the adversary drops the
rrc_release message (containing the indication of RRC suspend)
sent for the victim by the legitimate base station, it may force the
victim to stay in the RRC connected state instead of moving to
the inactive state. Now the adversary makes multiple phone calls
to the victim’s phone number for each of which the base station
broadcasts paging messages containing victim’s I-RNTI. Thus, the
adversary may learn the victim’s I-RNTI and the paging occasion at
which the base station sent paging containing the victim’s I-RNTI.
The adversary may use this to further hijack the paging channel
and perform stealthy denial-of-service attacks.
6.4 Prior Attacks Detected by 5GReasoner
In addition to the newly discovered attacks, 5GReasoner also iden-
tified 5 attacks, the underlying vulnerabilities of which were either
detected by prior work [14] or were inherited from 4G LTE. Table 1
summarizes the list of such attacks detected by 5GReasoner for 5G.
