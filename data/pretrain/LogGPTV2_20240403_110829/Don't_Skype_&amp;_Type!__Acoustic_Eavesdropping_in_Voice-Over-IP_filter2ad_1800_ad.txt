formation via social engineering techniques, e.g., laptop [13],
microphone [8] or webcam [17] ﬁngerprinting.
Key classiﬁcation. Once the attacker learns target-device,
it proceeds to determine keyboard input. However, it does
not have any extra information about the victim that can
be used to train the classiﬁer. Nonetheless, the attacker can
use, as a training set, data obtained from another user on a
laptop of the same model as target-device.
Figure 8: S&T attack performance – User Proﬁling
scenario, average accuracy.
Results reﬂected in Figure 8 show that top-1 accuracy de-
creases to as low as 14% on Toshiba and Lenovo laptops, and
to 19% on Macbook Pro. However, top-5 accuracy grows
to 41.9%, 54%, and 45.6% on Lenovo, Macbook Pro, and
Toshiba, respectively. This shows the utility of social engi-
neering techniques used to obtain labeled data of the victim,
even on a diﬀerent laptop.
5.2.4 Model Proﬁling Scenario
We now evaluate the most unfavorable and the most re-
alistic scenario where the attacker does not know anything
about the victim. Conducting S&T attack in this scenario
requires: (i) target-device classiﬁcation, followed by (ii) key
classiﬁcation.
Target-device classiﬁcation. The ﬁrst step for the at-
tacker is to determine whether target-device is a known model.
We assume that the attacker collected a database of acoustic
emanations from many keyboards.
When acoustic emanations from target-device are received,
if the model of target-device is present in the database, the
attacker can use this data to train the classiﬁer. To evaluate
this scenario, we completely excluded all records of one user
and of one speciﬁc laptop of the original dataset. We did this
to create a training set where both the victim’s typing style
and the victim’s target-device are unknown to the attacker.
We also added, to the training set, several devices, including
3 keyboards: Apple Pro, Logitech Internet, Logitech Y, as
well as 2 laptops: Acer E15 and Sony Vaio Pro 2013.
We did this to show that a laptop is recognizable from its
keyboard acoustic emanations among many diﬀerent mod-
els. We evaluated the accuracy of k-NN classiﬁer in ideni-
tifying the correct laptop model, on the Touch typing and
Skype ﬁltered data combination. Results show quite high
accuracy of 93%. This experiment conﬁrms that an attacker
can determine the victim’s device, by using acoustic emana-
tions.
Figure 9: S&T attack performance – Model Proﬁling
scenario, average accuracy.
Results of S&T attack in this scenario are shown in Fig-
ure 9. As expected, accuracy decreases with respect to pre-
vious scenarios. However, especially with Macbook Pro and
Toshiba datasets, we still have an appreciable advantage
from a random guess baseline. In particular, top-1 accuracy
goes from a 178% improvement from the baseline random
guess on Lenovo datasets, to a 312% improvement on Mac-
book Pro datasets. Top-5 accuracy goes from a 152% on
Lenovo to a 213% on Macbook Pro.
To further improve these results, the attacker can use an
alternative strategy to build the training set. Suppose that
the attacker recorded multiple users on a laptop of the same
model of the target-device and then combines them to form a
“crowd” training set. We evaluated this scenario as follows:
We selected the dataset of one user on a given laptop, as
a test set. We then created the training set by combining
the data of other users of the same laptop model. We re-
peated this experiment, selecting every combination of user
and laptop as a test set, and the corresponding other users
and laptop as a training set. Results reported in Figure 10
show that overall accuracy grows by 6-10%, meaning that
this technique further improves classiﬁer’s detection rate.
In particular, this increase in accuracy, from 185% to 412%
(with respect to a baseline random guess) yields a greater
improvement than the approach with a single user on the
training set.

uated both the accuracy of S&T attack, and the quality of
the call by using the voice recognition software CMU Sphinx
v5 [14] on the Harvard Sentences. We show the results in
Figure 11.
Figure 10: S&T attack performance – Model Pro-
ﬁling scenario with “crowd” training data, average
accuracy.
Results show that S&T attack is still quite viable in a
realistic VoIP scenario, with a target text which is both short
and random. Moreover, this is possible with little to none
speciﬁc training data of the victim, i.e., the attacker might
even have no prior knowledge of the victim.
5.3 VoIP-speciﬁc Issues
To conclude the experimental evaluation, we further an-
alyze the impact of issues that stem from using VoIP to
perform S&T attack. Using VoIP as the attack medium
poses additional challenges to the attacker, such as possible
presence of speech on top of the keystroke sounds. Also,
we need to investigate to what extent (if any) technical fea-
tures of the SILK codec [26] degrade performance of S&T
attack. For example, this codec reduces audible bandwidth
whenever available Internet bandwidth is low; this operation
degrades the sound spectrum.
We now analyze the impact of variable Internet band-
width on S&T attack performance, and the impact of voice
audio overlaying keyboard emanations, i.e., the victim talk-
ing while pressing keyboard keys.
5.3.1 Impact of Fluctuating Bandwidth
In the experimental setup, both VoIP end-points were
connected to a high-speed network. However, a realistic
call might go over slower or more error-prone network links.
Therefore, we performed a number of sample Skype calls
between the two end-points while monitoring network load
of the transmitter (i.e., the one producing emanations).
We experimented as follows: we ﬁltered all data recorded
on one Macbook Pro laptop by all the users with the HP
typing style using Skype, together with a ﬁve minutes sam-
ple of the Harvard Sentences, commonly used to evaluate the
quality of VoIP applications [24]. We initially let the Skype
software use the full bandwidth available, and we measured
that the software used an average of 70 Kbit/s without any
noticeable packet loss. We subsequently limited the band-
width of the transmitting machine at 60 Kbit/s, 50 Kbit/s,
40 Kbit/s, 30 Kbit/s, respectively, 20 Kbit/s. We observed
that, with values below 20 Kbit/s, the quality of the call
is compromised, because of frequent disconnections. S&T
attack with such a small bandwidth is therefore not possi-
ble, and we argue that real users suﬀering this degradation
of service would anyway not be willing neither able to con-
tinue the Skype call. Therefore, we believe the bandwidths
we selected are representative of all the conditions on which
Figure 11: Voice recognition and S&T attack accu-
racy, on data acquired through Skype with diﬀerent
connection bandwidths.
From Figure 11, we can see that, while there is no change
to the accuracy of the voice recognition software until the
20 Kbit/s threshold, the classiﬁer suﬀers a noticeable loss at
and under 40 Kbit/s. This analysis shows that aggressive
downsampling, and communication errors, can greatly hin-
der the accuracy of the attacker on the eavesdropping task,
and that a loss of the order of 20% is to be expected if the
connection speed is very low. We also observe that, at 20
Kbit/s, even if the Skype call is working, many samples of
both the speech and keyboard sounds are lost or irreparably
damaged due to the small bandwidth, and the ﬁnal qual-
ity of the call might be undesirable for the user. However,
it is realistic to assume Skype to be always working at the
best possible quality or almost at the best possible quality,
since 70-50Kbit/s are bandwidths that are small enough to
be almost guaranteed.
5.3.2 The Impact Of Voice
In the experiments we described so far, we did not con-
sider that the victim can possibly be talking while he types
the target text. However, in a VoIP call, this can happen
frequently, as it is probable that the victim is talking while
he types something on the keyboard of his target-device. We
evaluated the impact of this scenario as follows: we consid-
ered all the data of one user on the Macbook Pro laptop,
consisting of 260 samples, 10 for every class, in a 10-fold
cross-validation scheme. For every fold, we performed fea-
ture selection on the train data with a Recursive Feature
Elimination algorithm, and we then overlapped the test data
with a random part of a recording of some Harvard Sentences
with the pauses stripped out (so that the recording always
has some voice in it). To account for the random overlap, we
repeated the process 10 times, to have the keystroke sound
overlap diﬀerent random phonemes. We then evaluated the
mean and standard deviation of the accuracy of the classi-
ﬁer.
We repeated the described experiment with diﬀerent rela-
tive intensities of the voice against the intensity of the sound
of the keystrokes. We started at -20dB, meaning that the
keystrokes are 20dB louder than the voice of the speaker,
and evaluated progressive steps of 5dB, until we had the

performed this scheme on the data for all users on the Mac-
book Pro laptop, with Touch typing and data ﬁltered with
Skype. We show the results in Figure 12.
Figure 12: S&T attack performance – average ac-
curacy, overlap of keystroke sounds and voice, at
diﬀerent relative intensity.
We observe that, from −20dB until 0dB, S&T attack does
not suﬀer almost any performance loss, and then the ac-
curacy rapidly decreases, until it reaches the random guess
baseline at +20dB. We explain both the positive and the
negative results with the phenomenon of auditory mask-
ing [29], where only the most powerful tone among all the
tones at a given frequency is audible. In our case, the greater
the diﬀerence between the intensity of the sound of the
keystroke and of the voice, the more only the frequencies
of the louder sound will be audible. However, it is realistic
to assume that the speaker will talk at a reasonable volume
during the Skype call. Given that the keystrokes are very
loud when recorded from a laptop microphone (sometimes
almost peaking the headroom of the microphone), it is un-
likely that the victim will talk more than 5dB louder than a
keystroke sound. These results therefore show that the vic-
tim speaking does not prevent the attacker to perform S&T
attack.
5.4 S&T Practical Applications
We now consider two practical applications of the results
of S&T attack: understanding words, and cracking random
passwords.
In particular, if the victim is typing English
words, we analyze how S&T can help understanding such
words. If the victim is typing a random password, we show
how S&T attack can greatly reduce the average number of
trials required in order to crack it, via a brute force attack.
In the following, we report the results of these practical ap-
plications on the Complete Proﬁling scenario, and on the
Model Proﬁling scenario.
5.4.1 Word Recognition
To evaluate how S&T helps understanding the words that
the victim typed, we proceeded as follows. We drew a num-
ber of random words from an English dictionary; we call such
words actual words. For each actual word, we reconstructed
its typing sound combining the sound samples of each let-
ter in the actual word. We used the sound sample of the
letters we collected in Section 5.1. We then performed S&T
attack, to obtain the top-5 predictions for each letter of the
actual word, and we created a set of guessed words with the
predicted letters. We then calculated the error between the
actual word and the most probable guessed word, i.e., Ham-
ming distance / length of the word. We tested 1000 random
words for each of the datasets. On the Complete Proﬁling
scenario, we obtain an average error of 9.26% characters for
each word (± 8.25%), that goes down to 2.65% (± 5.90%)
using a simple spell checker, who is able to correct most
of the errors. We ﬁnd this trend independent of the word
length. On the Model Proﬁling scenario, we obtain an aver-
age error of 60.79% characters (± 9.80%), down to 57.76%
(± 11.50) using spell checking techniques. These results
are indicative of the possible applications of S&T attack,
and can be greatly increased with the use of more power-
ful spell checking techniques, Natural Language Processing
techniques, and crowd-sourced approaches (e.g., Google In-
stant).
5.4.2 Password Recognition
Secure passwords that prevent dictionary attacks are ran-
dom combinations of alphanumeric characters. In order to
understand how S&T attack helps in cracking such random
passwords, we analytically study the speed-up of an im-
proved brute-force scheme that takes advantage of our re-
sults. In particular, the scheme is as follows: given the x
guesses of S&T for each of the n characters of the target
password, we ﬁrst consider all the xn combinations of such
characters. We then assume that the set of x guesses of the
ﬁrst character was wrong, and subsequently consider all the
other characters. When we ﬁnish considering that one set
of guesses was wrong, we consider all the combinations of
two wrong guesses (i.e., ﬁrst and second sets of guesses were
wrong, ﬁrst and third sets were wrong, up to the seventh
and eighth sets). We repeat this scheme until we ﬁnally
try the combinations where the classiﬁer was always wrong.
This brute-force scheme leverages the probability of success
of S&T to minimize, on average, the required time to crack
a password. If we consider a target password of 10 lower-
case characters of the English alphabet, a regular brute-force
scheme requires requires (26)10
50% probability. On the Complete Proﬁling scenario, that
we recall has an average top-5 accuracy of more than 90%,
we only need 9.76 · 106 tries to have 50% probability. This
corresponds to a very high average speedup of 107, and an
entropy reduction of more than 50%. On the Model Proﬁl-
