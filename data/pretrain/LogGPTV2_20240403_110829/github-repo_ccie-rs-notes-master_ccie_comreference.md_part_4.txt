Multiple ares in a domain,primary created for summariztion. Summarization should be configured on each L1L2 router in the area. Done by adding **summary-address** command inside **router isis**. Applies equally to intra-area networks going from L1 to L2, and redistributed routes.

```
Routers providing connectivity for areas must be L1L2 routers, otherwise L1 routers cant form adj with them.
Passive interface behaviour is so that a network can be advertised without necessarily needing to be active in IS-IS (i.e. not forming adj). Similar to EIGRP for v6 where passive-interface default causes all local interfaces networks to be advertised in is-is

# IGP Route Redistribution, Route Summarization, Default Routing and Troubleshooting
## Route-Map match commands
- match interface - looks at outgoing interface of routes
- match ip address - Examines route prefix and prefix length (can use ACL or prefix list)
- match ip next hop - Examines routes next hop, use ACL
- match ip route-source - Match advertising routers IP, use acl
- match metric - Matches metric exactly, or optionally range of metrics (plus/minus configured deviation)
- match route-type - Matches route type (internval, external, E1/N1, E1/N2, level-1, level-2)
- match tag
## Set commands
- set level - Defined database into which route redist (l1, l2, l1l2, stub-area, backbone)
- set metric *metric-value* - Sets route metric OSPF, RIP and IS-IS
- set metric *bandwidth delay reliability loading mtu *- Sets IGRP/EIGRP metric
- set metric type - internal, external, type-1, type-2, for IS-IS and OSPF
- set tag
## Administrative distance
**distance ***distance *- RIP
**distance eigrp ***internal-dist external-dist*
**distance ospf {[intra-area ***dist1 ***] [ inter-area ***dist2***] [ external ***dist3 ***] }**
## Full Syntax redistribution
**redistribute ***protocol ***[ ***process-id ***] [ level-1 | level-1-2 | level-2 ] [ ***as-number ***] [ metric ***metric-value ***] [ metric-type ***type-value ***] [ match { internal | external 1 | external 2} ] [ tag ***tag-value ***] [ route-map ***map-tag ***] [ subnets ]**
### Notes
* Subnets causes subnets to be advertised into OSPF
* Default cost of 20 for OSPF from IGP, 1 from BGP
* Only redists routes in current IP routing table
By default, when redistributing into OSPF, only redistributes classful networks, hence **subnets** option. If **auto-summary** used, each redistributed network would show just the classiful networks.
## Distance per route
Can apply Distance to just a route, eg
**distance { ***distance-value ip-address ***{ ***wildcard-mask ***} [ ***ip-standard-list ***] [ ***ip-extended-list ***]**
## Route Tags
**distribute-list route-map check-tag-9999 in**
**redistribute ospf 1 route-map tag-ospf-9999 in**
## Route Summarization
### EIGRP
Place **ip summary-address eigrp ***as-number network-address subnet-mask *[ *admin-distance *] on an interface. Any component routes causes summary route to be sent out that interface.
### OSPF
- ASBR - **summary-address **{{* ip-address mask *} { *prefix-mask *}} **[not-advertise] [tag ***tag ***]**
- ABR - **area ***area-id ***range ***ip-address mask ***[advertise | not-advertise] [cost ***cost ***]**
For ABR command, this is the area for where component subnets reside. Can set cost of summary route rather than using lowest cost of all component routes.
## Default routes
- Static route to 0.0.0.0 with redistribute static command - EIGRP, RIP
- **default-information-originate **command - RIP, OSPF
- **ip default-network**- RIP, EIGRP
- Using summary routes - EIGRP
### Static routes with redistribute
- both commands need to be on same router
- Metric must be default or set
- Redistribute command can refer to route map, which examines all static routes
- EIGRP treats default route as external by default
### Default-information originate
- Redistributes any default route in table
- Can set metric and metric type directly, default cost of 1, type E2
- Allows use of always keyword, meaning default always exist even if not in table
- Supported in RIP but with differences
### IP Default network
- Local router must configure **ip default-network ***net-number*, with net-number being classful network number
- Classiful network must be in local routers IP routing table (by any means)
- For EIGRP, classiful network must be advertised by local router into EIGRP
### Route Summarization for defaults
- Local router creats local summary, dest null 0, using AD 5, when deciding whether its route is best one to add to local routing table
- Advertises summary to other ADs as 90
- Need to set higher distance in the **ip summary-address **command to not blackhole traffic
## PfR
## PfR Basic Configuration
### **Config of MC**
1. Create the authentication key chain
Auth required, uses MD5 keychain/keystring approach. Made under global config
R4 - MC
```
key chain PFR_AUTH
 key 1
  key-string DAVEPERFORMS
```
2. Enable PFR process
```
pfr master
```
3. Designate internal/external interfaces
MC must designate what interfaces on the BR are internal and external
```
pfr master
 border 2.2.2.2 key-chain PFR_AUTH
  interface Se0/0.21 internal
  interface Fa0/0 external
 border 3.3.3.3 key-chain PFR_AUTH
  interface Se0/0.31 internval
  interface Fa0/0 external
```
show oer master border
### **Config of BR**
1. Authentication key chain
```
key chain PFR_AUTH
 key 1
  key-string DAVEPERFORMS
```
2. Enable PfR process
```
pfr border
 master 4.4.4.4 key-chain PFR_AUTH
```
3. Specify the local itnerface
Need to specify a source, eg a loopback
```
pfr border
 local loopback 0
```
Can also use logging and change the port used as well (**logging **command under pfr border and **port 3950** under pfr border)
Will be seen as MC Active on MC when both BRs up (otherwise PfR is useless)

# Fundamentals of BGP operations
## Timers
```
router bgp 65001
 bgp timers keepalive holdtime
 neighbor x.x.x.x timers keepalive holdtime [min-holdtime]
```
## Router ID
```
bgp router-id
```
## Basic Config
```
router bgp 123
 no sync
 bgp router-id 111.111.111.111
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 neighbor 2.2.2.2 remote-as 123
 neighbor 2.2.2.2 update-source Loopback1
 neighbor 3.3.3.3 remote-as 123
 neighbor 3.3.3.3 update-source Loopback1
 neighbor 3.3.3.3 password DAVE-LIKES-BGP
 no auto-summary
 ```
## External neighbours
Single links usually, **ebgp-multihop** if not
## Resetting Prefers
**neighbor shutdown** - Shuts down a connection from config
**clear ip bgp * - **Resets neighbour connection, closes TCP, removes all entries in table for that neighbour, begins process of rediscovering neighbour after
## Network command
no auto-summary implied since 12.3 mainline
**network **{ *network-number *[ **mask ***network-mask *]} [ **route-map ***map-tag *]
## aggregate
**aggregate-address ***prefix mask - *Will advertise out aggregate
**aggregate-address ***prefix mask ***summary-only ***- *Will advertise out aggregate only
**aggregate-address ***prefix mask ***summary-only as-set***- *Will advertise out aggregate only with all ASNs in component subnets as an AS-SET
## Default routes
- Use **network **command
- Redistribute in
- Use **neighbor ***neighbor-id ***default-originate [ route-map ***route-map-name *] command
default-information-originate required to get default route in when redistributing
## Next hop treatment
- iBGP - **next-hop-self** to change it
- eBGP - **next-hop-unchanged** to not change it
## Showing per neighbour routes
**show ip bgp neighbour advertised-routes**
**show ip bgp neighbour received-routes ** - Only works if **neighbor ***neighbor*** soft-reconfiguration inbound **enabled
The * valid part in **show ip bgp** just means the route is a candidate for use. Before route can be used and added, NEXT_HOP must also be reachable
## Admin distance
Change under BGP for all routes with **distance bgp ***extenal internal local***. **Or change for a route with **distance ***distance {* *ip-address *{ *wildcard-mask *}} [ *ip-standard-list *| *ip-extended-list *]
## Backdoor route
There is the **network backdoor** command, following occurs: -
- Makes BGP route a local route, hence 200 AD by default
- Does not advertise route with BGP downstream (received it via eBGP)
## Confederations
As ASN stated in **router bgp **will now be confederation AS, cant configure on existing kit without taking down BGP on this router
**router bgp ***sub-as*
**bgp confederation identifier ***asn - *Defines true AS
**bgp confederation peers ***sub-asn - *Identifies a neighbouring AS as another sub-AS
## Route Reflectors
**neighbor ***neighbor ***route-reflector-client**
**bgp cluster-id ***id*
## MP-BGP
## Config of MP BGP
When MP-BGP activated, automatically carries IPv4 unicast routes. This can be disabled with
```
router bgp 1
 no bgp default ipv4-unicast
```
Some configs can carry VPN-IPv4 routes, some only v4, other carry both. Type of BGP session controlled with address families, and activating the peer in that AF. Known as context based routing.
Default context becomes catch all where any non-VRF based or IPv4-specific session can be configured. Anything in here injected into global table
Standard v4 config
```
router bgp 1
 neighbor 194.22.15.3 remote-as 1
 neighbor 194.22.15.3 update-source lo0
 neighbor 194.22.15.3 activate
```
AF config
```
router bgp 1
 address-family vpnv4
  neighbor 194.22.15.3 activate
```
Another command required to support MP-BGP-specific extended communities
**neighbor ***neighbor ***send-community extended/standard/both. **Default sends only extended.
# BGP Routing Policies
## Filtering types
- **neighbor distribute-list** - Using standard ACL, can match prefix with wildcard mask
- **neighbor distribute-list **- Using extended ACL, can match prefix and length, with WC mask for each
- **neighbor prefix-list ** - Exact or first N bits pf prefix, plus range of prefix lengths
- **neighbor filter-list** - AS_PATH contents
- **neighbor route-map** - Prefix, prefix length, AS_PATH, and/or any PA matchable
## Filtering based on NLRI
### Route Map Rules for NLRI Filtering
**deny** as a route-map action will filter a route, whereas in a prefix-list or ACL is specifies whether it matches or doesnt match
### Soft reconfig
**clear ip bgp { * | neighbor-address | peer-group-name} [ soft [in | out ]]**
IOS supports soft reconfig for send update automatically, needs enabling for inbound. **neighbor ***neighbor-id ***soft-reconfiguration inbound**. This means updates received will be stored.
## Filtering based on aggregate-address command
Can allow none, all, or subset of summaries routes. This means filtering certain routes is an option. Filter all with **summary-only**, allow all with no **summary-only**, or use a supress map to allow certain ones through.
## AS PATH filtering
1. Configure AS_PATH filter using **ip as-path access-list ***number ***permit/deny ***regex*
2. Enable AS_PATH filter with **neighbor ***neighbor-id ***filter-list ***as-path-filter-number ***{ in | out }**
### Types to match
* AS_SEQ standard
* AS_SET has comma delimiter between ASNs, enclosing segment with {}
* AS_CONFED_SEQ has space delimiter between ASNs, enclosing segment with ()
* AS_CONFED_SET has comma delimiter between ASNs, enclosing segment with {}
### regex
1. Regex of first line in list applied to AS_PATH of each route
2. For matched NLRIs, NLRI passed/filtered based on that AS_ATH filters configured **permit **or **deny**
3. For unmatched, Step 1 and 2 repeated using next line in filter
4. Any NLRIs not matched explicitly is filtered
- ^ - Start of line
- $ - End of line
- | - Logical OR
- _ - Any delimiter (blank, comma, start of line, end of line)
- . - Any single character
- ? - Zero or one instance of character
- * - Zero or more instances of character
- + - One or more instance of character
- (string) - Combine enclose string characters as a single entity when used with other characters (eg (49182)+)
- [string] - Wildcard for which any single character in string can be used to match that position in AS_PATH
To match an AS_CONFED, need to enclose brackets like so, [(], as ( is a regex character already
## BGP Decision process
Shortest AS_PATH length can be ignored with **bgp bestpath as-path ignore**
First 9 steps done before ** maximum-paths** comes into play
Choose smallest neighbor RID, use route who next-hop router RID is smallest, only performed if **bgp bestpath compare-routerid **configured
## Configuring BGP Policies
