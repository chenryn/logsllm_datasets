High Security Locks and
Standards
• Normal vs. High Security
• Facility specifications based on
UL/ANSI
• Protection: Forced, Covert, Key control
• Protection of high value and critical
targets

Standards (ANSI/BHMA)
• ANSI 156.5
– Auxiliary Locks
– Graded 1-3 (1=highest rating)
• ANSI 156.30
– High Security Cylinders
– Graded A-C (A=highest rating)
Standards (ANSI A156.5)
Security Tests
• Impact
• Tension
• Torque
• Impact
• Sawing
• Pressure
• Tensile
In addition to the above requirements all cylinders must meet all
DRILLING(5min) and PICKING(10min) requirements of UL-437
Standards (ANSI A156.30)
High Security Cylinders
• Key Control (ratings are cumulative)
– C - Manufacturer restricted blanks
– B - Blanks protected by law
– A - Authorization required
• Forced Entry Extensions (Above A156.5)
Standards (ANSI A156.30)
• Pick Resistance (Cumulative)
C: Minimum of 2 Security Pins
 Paracentric Keyway
 Minimum of one bore depth designed to prevent
overlifting
B: Meets all levels of C plus UL-437 for pick 
resistance (10 min)
A: Resist picking for 15 min as tested by 5 “ALOA 
Certified” Locksmiths with “commercially” 
available tools
What is “High Security”?
Standards (UL-437)
• Cabinet Locks
• Door Locks
• Locking Cylinder
• Security Containers
• Two-Key Locks
UL-437
Higher Security: Not High Security
Tests Include:
- Endurance
- Attack Resistance

Common Hand Tools
LIES
• Representations by lock manufacturers
• Design issues and failures
• Bypass methods not contemplated
Representations by
Manufacturers
• Locks are secure
• High security v. standard locks
• Implied representations
• Know or should have known of problems
• Meet specifications?
• Need truth in packaging and advertising
Design Issues
• Failure of imagination
• Design engineer problem
• Key never unlocks the lock
• Moshe Dyan problem
Mechanical Bypass
• Defeating locks in less than a minute
• Not included in standards
– Not forced or covert entry
• Many certified locks can be
compromised
• Public is misled
Mechanical Bypass:
Another Method of Entry
• Wires and shims
• Vibration, shock, bumping
• Air pressure
• Magnetics
• Breaking of internal components
• Radio Frequency energy
• Temperature
Failure of Imagination
• Mechanical bypass
• Forced entry techniques
• Covert entry techniques
• Key control compromise
– Manufacturers cannot find the
vulnerabilities
Design Defects
• Failure to understand laws of physics
• Failure to understand methods of entry
• Failure to imagine
– Generally simple design failures
– Directly affect the security of the lock
– Affect any security ratings
– Mislead the consumer
Case Examples
• El Safe (UnSafe) hotel safe
• File cabinet locks
• Targus Defcon CL
• Padlocks: Master and Corbin Sesamee
• Codelock electronic lock
• Kwikset
• Medeco
El Safe in room hotel safe
• Security = gear drive in back of door
File Cabinet Locks
• Security = spring loaded locking dog
Targus Defcon CL
• Piece of plastic to decode gate position
Padlocks
• Master combination
• Corbin Sesamee
Codelocks CL1000
• Security = spring loaded blocking tab
Codelocks 5000
Moshe Dyan Problem
“The road from Damascus to Tel Aviv also runs from
Tel Aviv to Damascus”
• Drain hole out: wire in
Kwikset Maximum Security
• Defective design
• No real security
• Open in under 30 seconds
• No apparent evidence of entry
Kwikset Ultra Max
• No real security
• Defective design
Common Myths
• Key Control
• Bumping
• Picking
• Mechanical Bypass
MEDECO:
The High Security Cylinder
• Protects high value and critical targets
• For 35 years: THE lock to attack
• UL437 and ANSI 156.30 rated
• Advertising Statements: Consider in context
– “bump proof”
– Highly pick resistant
– Key control
– Secure
MEDECO “CAVEATS”
• High quality locks and hardware
• Secure for most locations and uses
• May be vulnerable for high value targets
• User needs to assess security
• Security depends upon many factors
– Location and value of target
– Expected sophistication of attack
– Master key or non-master key system
MEDECO m3
• Replaced the Biaxial in 2005 when
patent expired
• Biaxial design with slider
• Three levels of security:
– Pin tumblers elevated to shear line
– Pin tumblers rotated to correct angles
– Slider moved to correct position
Medeco m3 Design
Common Myth #1:
Key Control
• UL 437: No key control criteria
• ANSI 156.30
– Patent protected blanks
– Cannot replicate the blanks
– Cannot duplicate the keys
– Factory control of keys produced by code
Medeco Key Control
• Biaxial patent expired in 2005
• Replaced with m3
• m3 is protected but can be simulated
• Restricted keyways can be bypassed
• Security feature of m3 can be bypassed
which does not infringe on patent
Medeco m3 Meets the Paper Clip
“Michaud M3 Degrade Attack”
Common Myth #2: Bumping
• Some High security locks can be
bumped open
– Locks can be bumped: Not all but many
– Depends on many factors
– Sidebar codes must be known or simulated
– Patent filing for technique to bump
Medeco Not Bump-proof
• Medeco:
– “Our locks are bump proof!”
– “Our locks are virtually bump proof!”
Virtually bump proof = virtual reality
Virtual Reality
Common Myth #3: Picking
• Special pick and decoder tools
developed
• Medeco locks can be extremely difficult
to pick because of pin rotation
• A target for 35 years
• Attempts largely unsuccessful
• Caveats
Picking Medeco Locks
• Medeco locks can be picked with
conventional tools with a special
technique in patent filing
• High percentage of these locks can be
picked
Common Myth #4:
Hardware Bypass
• Kwikset UltraMax and others
• Medeco hardware security: Is it really
secure?
• Example: Deadbolts - A failure of
imagination
• The entire security is based upon two
small components
“The key never unlocks the lock!”
Medeco Security: Two Screws
Loose!
Medeco Security: Two Screws
Loose!
• Medeco Deadbolt Lock
– Security is based upon two tiny screws
– Can be compromised in under 30 seconds
– Will not meet high security standards
• UL and ANSI does not address this issue
• Bypass of deadbolt mechanism
• Design incompetence
LIABILITY
• Defective or deficient products
• Negligent designs
• Misrepresentations in packaging
• Manufacturers are experts
• Federal statutes
• Fiduciary duty to customers
– DCR v. PEAK
NEEDED: Real World Testing
• Propose Security Laboratories
– Security professionals
– Manufacturers
– Law enforcement
– Locksmiths
– Hackers: Vulnerability Geeks
• Why we need Physical Security Hackers
SECURITY LABORATORIES
• Disclosure Policy
– Product beta v. introduced
– Can the problem be fixed
– Who’s at risk
– Notify manufacturer: recall or replace
– How many locks are affected
– Level of risk
– National security issues?
DISCLOSURE CRITERIA
• Public or private disclosure
• Level of threat
• Likelihood of exploit
• Market penetration
• Level of disclosure
– Security issues only
– Detail the vulnerability
– Demonstrate the vulnerability
Product Testing
• For members
• For non-members
• Confidentiality
• Privilege
• Propose new designs
Feedback
• Idea of joint cooperation
• Structure of Security Laboratories
• Disclosure policy
• Use of hackers
