Question: "If an adversary has wiped configuration files on network devices using Network Device CLI commands, why would upgrading network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) alone not be sufficient to prevent such incidents in the future?"
 "A": "Because NIDS are primarily focused on monitoring network traffic and may not detect command execution or unauthorized changes to device configurations."
 "B": "Because NIDS are outdated technology and have been replaced by next-generation firewalls in modern network security infrastructures."
 "C": "Because NIDS typically prevent physical access to network devices, not the execution of CLI commands by authorized users."
 "D": "Because NIDS are designed to prevent data backups from being accessed or destroyed, which is not relevant to wiping configuration files."
Answer: A
