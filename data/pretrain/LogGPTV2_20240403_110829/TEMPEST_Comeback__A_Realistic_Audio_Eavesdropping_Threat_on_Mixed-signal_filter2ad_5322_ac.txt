In Summary, concerning the suggested generative principle and
the strong coupling conditions, the result experimentally verifies
that the target MSoC meets the coupling conditions as mentioned
in Subsection 2.2.
3.4.4 Reconstruction Attack from a Distance. To demonstrate that
the new threat based on the SWREG noise is more critical, we
increase the distance between the target board and the antenna
under the same experimental setup with the microphone. Due to
the distance restriction of the anechoic chamber, we perform the
experiments up to 5 meters. Figure 10 shows the experimental
results at 192 MHz in relation to the distance when the frequency
sweep tone (from DC to 20 kHz) and a piece of music (a part of
“We will Rock You” of Queen) sounds are consecutively played
into the microphone. The left parts of Figure 10 show the post-
processed time signals according to each distance; and the silent
and sound sections can be distinguished at a distance of 5 meters.
The spectrograms (the right parts of Figure 10) additionally show
that the sweep tone and music have sufficient spectral similarity
and intelligibility at 5 meters. The results of the sweep tone are more
intelligible than those of the music. The intelligibility difference
between two reconstructed signals can be explained since the power
of a single tone is focused on a single frequency, in comparison to
the music. We can expect that the tone signal could be sufficiently
recognizable at more than 5 meters distance. All the captured signals
stored with “wav” format are also available on the web link [12].
3.5 Leakage Analysis on Other MSoCs
3.5.1 Target MSoCs. To generalize the vulnerability of the illus-
trated new TEMPEST threat based on the SWREG noise, we mea-
sure the unintentional leakage EM radiations for four additional
popular MSoCs manufactured by the four vendors as shown in
Session 4B: Physical Attacks CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA1091Table 2. The target devices are not commercial products but devel-
opment kits (DKs) that are made by each MSoC manufacturer, re-
spectively. The primary selection criteria of the MSoCs are whether
they are recently released and highly integrated, including SWREG.
We configure the same experimental setup with the function gen-
erator, except the supplied ADC 𝑉𝑝𝑝 as shown in Table 2.
Frequency Distributions of Signal Leaks. Appendix C shows
3.5.2
the leakage and noise power distributions of each MSoC. Table 2
also presents the measured strong radiation source parameters
(𝑓𝑆 𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘 and 𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒). In Figure 20(a) of Appendix C,
the nRF52832 emits the AM modulated unintentional EM waves at
every 8 MHz (𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒) which is the same as the nRF52840;
the spectral peaks at every 64 MHz (𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒) are also ob-
served. In Figure 20(b) of Appendix C, the CC2640R2 emits the
strong power peaks at intervals of 48 MHz (𝑓𝑆 𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘) and 750
kHz (𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒). The strong EM leakages in the CSR1010 are
observable at the intervals of 16 MHz (𝑓𝑆 𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚_𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘) and 4 MHz
(𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒). However, in the case of the Qualcomm QCA4020,
any leakage coupled with the ADC signal over the noise floor can-
not be traced in the frequency range. This fact might imply that the
MSoC and DK are already carefully designed to protect radiations
(e.g., relatively small 𝑉𝑝𝑝 input range and the additional metallic
enclosure). Except for the QCA4020, it can be generally said that
most of MSoCs, which especially have not been carefully designed,
are in a state that vulnerability may be possible.
4 TEMPEST ATTACKS IN REAL
ENVIRONMENT
So far, we verify the radiation mechanism by measuring the fre-
quency distribution of leakage signals on DKs of popular MSoCs in
an anechoic chamber. Based on the results in the ideal environment,
in this section, we show that the new TEMPEST attack based on
the SWREG noise on commercial devices could happen around us.
4.1 Target Commercial Devices
As target devices, we select nine commercial products from various
manufacturers as shown in Table 3. The products are categorized
into two types, considering their usage. The device C1 is a “Blue-
tooth voice recorder” that adopts the nRF52810 MSoC. All other
products are recently popular “Bluetooth earbuds,” which are uti-
lized to wirelessly listen to music or make a phone conversation.
4.2 Attack scenarios
The first attack scenario through the vulnerability suggested in this
paper is the real-time eavesdropping on call conversation made by
a victim using Bluetooth earbuds. (a) A victim makes a phone call
with earbuds. (b) Suppose an attacker already know the model name
of the earbuds, the attacker could know its radiation frequencies
from the pre-investigated frequency database. (c) By receiving the
EM signals and post-processing, the attacker could surreptitiously
eavesdrop the victim’s conversation at a remote site in real-time.
The second scenario is to eavesdrop on conversations of a secret
meeting that is held in a closed room while recording the conversa-
tion using a voice recorder for the purpose of keeping records. The
detailed attack sequence is the same as that of earbuds.

4.3 Experimental Setup
The experimental environment was set up in the consideration of a
real-world scenario as follows:
Real Radio Environment. as an experimental site, we consider
an office environment where licensed frequency signals and various
RF noises, caused by multiple PCs and smart devices, coexist in
the same area. However, we assume that the radio propagation
environment between the target device and the adversary’s antenna
is the line-of-sight. The reason why we do not consider a complex
situation (i.e., obstacles, such as a glass or a wall) is that the radio
propagation model according to frequencies, medium, obstacles are
theoretically already well analyzed and proven; from the line-of-
sight experimental results, one can predict degradation effects of
obstacles based on a received signal power and an attack range.
Portable Equipment. a huge size wideband directional antenna
(0.6 m × 1.65 m × 1.68 m size and 5 kg weight) of the previous
experiments was replaced with the two small PCB antennas, LP0410
(from 400 MHz to 1 GHz) and LP0965 (from 850 MHz to 6.5 GHz).
Figure 11 shows the full equipment set for the attack; an attacker
can pack all the set in a briefcase and can easily carry it due to the
benefit of its portable weight.
4.4 Estimation of Frequency Parameters Using
Probe
Before attacking the commercial devices, we first measure the ra-
diated frequency parameter (𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒) of the devices. A near-
field probe (EM-6882, from 20 MHz to 230 MHz) is employed in
order not to miss a small power component radiated from the de-
vices. Considering the categories of the devices, we receive signals
according to the following setup:
Voice recorder (ADC). (a) connect a smartphone to the target
device with Bluetooth, (b) an external speaker generates the fre-
quency sweep tone (DC to 20 kHz) toward the device, and (c) record
the received audio signal from the device with smartphone App.
Earbuds (DAC). (a) connect a smartphone to the target device
with Bluetooth, and (b) play the sweep tone at the smartphone.
Then, the sweep tone is played in the speaker of the target device.
After experimental measurements, we obtain the frequency dis-
tributions of the coupled sweep tone in each target device as shown
in Figure 21 of Appendix D, and the estimated switching frequencies
(𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒) are shown in Table 3. As expected, all the target
products radiate unintentional coupled sweep tone signals over
a wide frequency range at intervals of 𝑓𝑆𝑊 𝑅𝐸𝐺_𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 noise (from
1 MHz to 6 MHz). Even though the measured frequency range is
limited due to the operating range of the probe, we can noticeably
