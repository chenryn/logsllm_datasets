User: There is a python script I built called convert.py, which is a file converter (SQLite3 -> SQLite3). It takes about 30 minutes to finish, working on with heavy CPU and I/O.
I opened 30 CMD.EXE windows on my computer (Windows 7, CPU with 2 cores and hyper-threading), and started convert.py on each  window. I let them work over night, so I expected that it will be all done until next morning ... but it didn't. Only half of them were done. The CPU monitor log told me that my computer was working 100% on it for 1 hour and suddenly it started to use only 25%. It seems that all CPU power wasn't used for the left tasks.
The left tasks resumed it work when I pressed Ctrl+C on it.
So, what is going on? Is this problem a python's problem, or windows' problem? Is there a way to let my computer work constantly 100% on my python script until all of them are done?
Assistant: The reason was that each process used massive memory, and I tried to work it concurrently. It was over capacity. It was frequently swapping out, but it was hidden by SQLite access which was also working hard with my HDD.
I would like to thank Lennart, who notified me to check other params in my computer, and everybody who gave me guesses and hints, since I gave too less information about the issues occuring in front of me.
