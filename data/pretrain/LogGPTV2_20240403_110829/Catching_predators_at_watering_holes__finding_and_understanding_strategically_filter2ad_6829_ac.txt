### Pre-Filtering System and Dataset Evaluation

A pre-filtering system, though promising, requires a more extensive study on a larger dataset for comprehensive validation. To evaluate the system, we ran Eyeson on all collected HTTP traffic spanning 5.4 years (as detailed in Table 2). This dataset includes 14 million snapshots for 133,527 monitored URLs, with a clean profile built for each monitored URL. 

In our experiment, we initialized the profile for each monitored URL with 10 visits: an initial 5 visits followed by 5 additional visits to collect change rates. Eyeson was then run over all the snapshots in chronological order. The profile change rate series was reset at the beginning of each calendar year or whenever a time gap of over three months was detected, due to missing data in the archive. We used a 95% confidence interval to scan the collected HTTP traffic based on the timeline of the snapshots, which included both archived and real-time visits.

Eyeson detected 1.7 million significant changes (visits) across 2.7 million URLs (embedded links) hosted on 17,600 fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and 456 static IP addresses. These findings are detailed in Appendix A and Table 10.

### Potential as a Pre-Filtering System

Currently, Eyeson serves as a measurement methodology to identify potential watering hole instances but is not yet ready for full organizational pre-filtering. However, with appropriate modifications and further organizational evaluations, Eyeson has the potential to function as a pre-filtering system. In terms of toxicity levels (i.e., the fraction of confirmed alerts), Eyeson outperforms Evilseed [35], with 3.4%-7.4% of confirmed malicious domains compared to 1.12% for Evilseed. Further details on Eyeson 2.0 are provided in Appendix A.

### Identifying Compromised Websites

Running the system over 5.4 years of traffic resulted in the detection of numerous suspicious visits. Some of these were false positives, attributed to legitimate changes (such as website design upgrades and template changes), ad-related URLs not covered by whitelists (especially when hosted on the monitored domain itself, e.g., OpenX ad platform), or malformed URLs. Additionally, the content related to many of the detected changes was missing from the archives, making their legitimacy difficult to verify.

To validate the outputs for new watering holes, we implemented a multi-step validation process:

1. **Blacklist Cross-Matching**: We cross-matched the detected changes with several blacklists (Table 2). Since the HTTP traffic we collected often relates to website snapshots from a few years ago, the compromises involving those sites may have already been reported to blacklists. We used historical blacklist data to validate detected domains and their snapshots. For example, CleanMX virus watch [13] maintains a large number of URLs, many of which are legitimate domains that were compromised for short periods. To avoid false positives, we linked the blacklisted URLs to the dates they were reported as compromised.

2. **VirusTotal Scanning**: We leveraged VirusTotal [62], which provides an API for scanning URLs and files. We scanned the output from Eyeson, excluding cloud-related URLs, as VirusTotal often flags them as malicious based on reports from one or two antivirus systems. For cloud-related URLs, we only used VirusTotal if the content was available and could be scanned.

3. **Manual Analysis and Clustering**: To maximize the chance of finding new watering hole cases, we considered suspicious URLs that indicated the hosting status as currently parked, down, using DDNS, URL shorteners, cloud-related hosting, or static IPs. We clustered the new URLs based on their patterns (tokenized sequences including paths, file names, and other parameters without values) and further clustered the detected monitored domains by the frequency of changes. We then randomly selected suspicious change cases from these clusters for manual analysis.

Through this process, we confirmed many compromised domains, many of which turned out to be watering holes. Manual validation is crucial, as watering holes are rarely caught by blacklists and VirusTotal, especially for recent ones (2014 and later).

### Finding New Watering Holes

After the three-step validation process, we generated a set of confirmed compromised visits corresponding to 3,200 monitored FQDNs (details in Table 10). The next challenge was to determine whether any of these confirmed compromises were indeed watering hole attacks. This is difficult because it requires understanding the perpetrator's intention, which can only be done by comparing the compromises with known cases, looking for attackers' fingerprints, and leveraging cyber intelligence. 

We forwarded our findings to leading industry agencies experienced in watering hole analysis for cross-agency validation. Due to the high cost and complexity of this validation process, we hand-picked a few likely instances from the confirmed attack cases. We randomly selected a few compromised domains confirmed by VirusTotal or blacklists if the attacks were marked as "exploit." We also picked out those whose suspicious changes happened recently and were therefore more likely to be validated using available data.

In the end, we forwarded 30 FQDNs to our industry partner, which, along with other organizations, analyzed 20 of them over the past three months, confirming 7 new watering hole attacks. Among these was a high-profile JSONP attack (Section 4.1), a politically oriented case later reported in the media [23, 58, 51, 64]. Additionally, we searched all suspicious URLs for indicators of known watering holes (e.g., ScanBox) and found 10 new unreported watering holes.

### Understanding Watering Holes

#### Results Overview

As a result of the manual validation and collaborations with industry partners, we confirmed 17 new unreported watering holes corresponding to 16 FQDNs, with one domain being strategically compromised twice. Discovering 17 watering hole attacks is a significant achievement in targeted attack research, as such attacks are infrequent and stealthy. Our new discoveries increase the publicly available attack instances by 59%.
