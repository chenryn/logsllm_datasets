license established in section 4 of the TOU, use of Glider includes copying to RAM within
the meaning of section 106 of the Copyright Act, users of WoW and Glider are not entitled
to a section 117 defense, and Glider users therefore infringe Blizzard’s copyright.  MDY
does not dispute that the other requirements for contributory and vicarious copyright
infringement are met, nor has MDY established a misuse defense.  The Court accordingly
will grant summary judgment in favor of Blizzard with respect to liability on the contributory
and vicarious copyright infringement claims in Counts II and III.

on Blizzard’s counterclaim under 17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1) (Dkt. #45 at 12), but MDY’s
motion contains no discussion of this statutory provision (id. at 13-16) and its reply brief only
addresses the section in one sentence (Dkt. #69 at 6-7).

III.
Blizzard’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act Claim (Count IV).
Blizzard alleges that MDY has violated the DMCA.  Specifically, Blizzard claims that
MDY traffics in technological products, services, devices, or components designed to
circumvent technological measures Blizzard has put in place to control access to its
copyrighted work and to protect its rights as the copyright owner of WoW.  Blizzard moves
for summary judgment on all of its DMCA claims.  MDY moves for summary judgment on
Blizzard’s claim under 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2).  The Court will grant MDY’s motion insofar
as it applies to Blizzard’s game client software code, but deny the motions in all other
respects.8  
A.
Section 1201(a)(2).
 This section of the DMCA provides that “[n]o person shall manufacture, import, offer
to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device,
component, or part thereof” that “is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of
circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected
under this title[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)(A).  Even if the product is not “primarily designed
or produced” for this purpose, this section of the DMCA may be violated if the product has
only limited commercially significant purposes other than to circumvent the technological
measure, or if the product is sold with the knowledge that it will be used in circumventing
the technological measure.  Id. § 1201(a)(2)(B)-(C).  “[A] technological measure ‘effectively
controls access to a work’ if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the
application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright
owner, to gain access to the work.”  Id. § 1201(a)(3)(B).
Blizzard alleges that MDY has violated this provision by enabling Glider to evade
Blizzard technologies designed to detect and prevent the use of bots by WoW players.
Blizzards’ protections, referred to in the briefing as “Warden,” include two different software

components.  One component, known as “scan.dll,” scans the user’s computer for
unauthorized programs such as Glider before the user logs onto the WoW servers to play the
game.  If Glider or similar programs are detected, scan.dll denies the user access to the game
servers.  The second component, referred to as the “resident” component of Warden, runs
periodically while a user plays WoW.  If the resident software detects the use of Glider or
a similar program, Blizzard revokes access to the game.  
Blizzard argues that scan.dll and its resident software control access to its copyrighted
software, as required by section 1201(a)(2), in two different but related respects.  First, when
scan.dll prevents a user from playing WoW, or when the resident software terminates a user’s
playing of WoW, they prevent additional code in the game client software from being written
to RAM.  Second, scan.dll and the resident software bar access to WoW’s “non-literal
elements, which are the products that are generated by the code’s interaction with the
computer hardware and operating programs.”  Dkt. #70 at 7 (citations in parentheses
omitted).  Blizzard explains that these non-literal elements include “the multi-media
presentation of the WoW universe and character interactions.”  Id.  Because scan.dll and the
resident software prevent a user from further writing of the software code to RAM, and from
further accessing these non-literal elements, Blizzard contends that Warden constitutes an
effective access control device within the meaning of § 1201(a)(2).  
MDY asserts that a holder of Blizzard’s game client software has full and complete
access to the software code.  This access is available on the CD that contains the game client
software or on the user’s hard drive once the game client software is loaded on the user’s
computer.  The user thereafter can view or copy the game client software code, regardless
of whether the user actually plays WoW or encounters Warden.  MDY likewise argues that
the user has full access to the non-literal aspects of the WoW software through the game
client software, and that these non-literal aspects can be viewed on the user’s computer.
With respect to the code contained in the game client software, the Court agrees with
MDY.  The Court has found no Ninth Circuit law that addresses this issue, but the following
explanation from the Sixth Circuit is highly relevant:

It is not Lexmark’s authentication sequence that “controls access” to
the Printer Engine Program.  See 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2).  It is the purchase
of a Lexmark printer that allows “access” to the program.  Anyone who buys
a Lexmark printer may read the literal code of the Printer Engine Program
directly from the printer memory, with or without the benefit of the
authentication sequence, and the data from the program may be transferrable
into readable source code after which copies may be freely distributed.  No
security device, in other words, protects access to the Printer Engine Program
code and no security device accordingly must be circumvented to obtain
access to the program code.
The authentication sequence, it is true, may well block one form of
“access” – the “ability to . . . make use of” the Printer Engine Program by
preventing the printer from functioning, but it does not block another
relevant form of “access” – the ability to [ ] obtain” a copy of the work or to
“make use of” the literal elements of the program (its code).  Because the
statute refers to “control[ling] access to a work protected under this title,” it
does not naturally apply when the “work protected under this title” is
otherwise accessible.  Just as one would not say that a lock on the back door
of a house “controls access” to a house whose front door does not contain a
lock and just as one would not say that a lock on any door of a house
“controls access” to the house after its purchaser receives the key to the lock,
it does not make sense to say that this provision of the DMCA applies to
otherwise-readily-accessible copyrighted works.
Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 387 F.3d 522, 547 (6th Cir. 2004). 
The same is true with respect to the code contained in Blizzard’s game client software.
A user has full access to that code once the game client software has been placed on the user’s
computer.  The user need not pass through Blizzard’s security devices to gain access to the
code.  The user may view the code on the hard drive and may freely copy it to another hard
drive, a CD, a jump drive, or other media.  Because scan.dll and the resident software do not
control access to the code in Blizzard’s game client software, section 1201(a)(2) does not
apply and MDY’s marketing of Glider with capabilities of evading scan.dll and the resident
software does not violate the statute.  The Court therefore will grant summary judgment in
favor of MDY on this issue. 
Blizzard argues for a contrary result on the basis of Ticketmaster.  In Ticketmaster,
however, the district court concluded that Ticketmaster’s protective software, known as
CAPTCHA, “controls access to a protected work because a user cannot proceed to copyright
protected web pages without solving CAPTCHA[.]”  507 F. Supp. 2d at 11-12 (emphasis in
original).  A purchaser of Blizzard game client software, by contrast, can view and copy the

9 The Sixth Circuit in Lexmark noted that “[i]n the essential setting where the DMCA
applies, the copyright protection operates on two planes:  in the literal code governing the
work and in the visual or audio manifestation generated by the code’s execution.”  387 F.3d
at 548.  Blizzard’s reference to the “non-literal elements” of its game appears to be the same
as Lexmark’s second plane.  Although the Sixth Circuit addressed this issue, the parties have
provided no factual basis upon which the Court may analyze it in this case.

code within that software without passing through scan.dll or the resident software.
The Court cannot similarly grant summary judgment with respect to the non-literal
elements of Blizzard’s game.  The parties’ statements of fact say virtually nothing about this
aspect of the game, and the Court is therefore unable to determine whether MDY or Blizzard
is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  Blizzard argued in its reply memorandum
that a user of WoW could not gain access to the non-literal elements of the game without
passing through scan.dll and the resident software, but has provided no factual support for this
assertion.  MDY disputed the assertion during oral argument, but has provided no factual
support for its position.  The Court therefore will deny the motions of both parties on this
issue.9
The Court has identified an additional apparent defect in Blizzard’s section 1201(a)(2)
claim.  The statute applies only to the circumvention of a “technological measure” that, “in
the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or
a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work.”  17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(3)(B).  Blizzard’s scan.dll and resident software do not appear to satisfy this
description.  Both software programs function by searching for the presence of bots and
similar programs.  As Blizzard explained in its statement of facts, the scan.dll component
“finds” unauthorized programs, and the resident software “scans” for cheats and other
unauthorized programs.  Dkt. #40 ¶¶ 110-115.  These programs thus do not appear to require
the application of information by the game user, or the application of a process or a treatment
by the game user, before granting access to copyrighted information.  Because the parties did
not address this issue in their briefs and have not provided specific factual information
concerning this question, however, the Court will not rely on it to grant summary judgment

10 MDY also argues that scan.dll and the resident software are not “effective”
protection devices and therefore do not fall within section 1201(a)(2).  The Court is not
convinced, however, that only effective measures are covered by the statute.  Although the
statute includes that word, it is a term of art defined in section 1201(a)(3)(A).  Nothing in the
definition suggests that the Court must assess the success of scan.dll and the resident
software in determining whether they enjoy the protection of the statute.  And as other courts
have noted, affording protection only to effective measures – measures that cannot be
circumvented – would render the statute a nullity.  See Lexmark, 387 F.2d at 549;  Universal
City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 294, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).

for MDY.  This will be a factual issue for trial.10
B.
Section 1201(b)(1).
This provision of the DMCA is similar to section 1201(a)(2), with one critical
difference.  Section 1201(a)(2) applies to protective measures that control access to software.
Section 1201(b)(1) applies to “a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a
copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(1)(A).
The protection of copyright rights, not controlling access, is key.  The statute further provides
that “a technological measure ‘effectively protects the rights of a copyright owner under this
title’ if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise
limits the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.”  17 U.S.C. § 1201(b)(2)(B).
Blizzard seeks summary judgment on this claim, arguing that scan.dll and the resident
software constitute technological measures that, in the ordinary course of their operation,
prevent, restrict, or otherwise limit the exercise of a right of Blizzard as the copyright owner.
Specifically, Blizzard asserts that scan.dll and the resident software prevent users from
copying software code to RAM and accessing the non-literal elements of the game once they
are caught using Glider.
MDY disputes this factual assertion.  MDY contends that code from the game client
software is not written to RAM after a user passes by scan.dll or the resident software.
Dkt. #58 at ¶¶ 35-39.  Although Blizzard contends that scan.dll and the resident software
prevent a user from accessing the non-literal elements of the game, as noted above, Blizzard
and MDY have failed to address this aspect of the case in their statements of fact.  Because
