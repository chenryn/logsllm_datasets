Hi, I'm not sure the exact state of deno right now. I was just introduced to
it. One of the things I was wondering, was how we can handle running commands
similarly to nodejs in the package.json.
So previously we could define, for example:
    "build": "webpack ."
Is there a way to do this in deno, otherwise, how should a development
environment be done?
