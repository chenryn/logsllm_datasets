User: I want to install pillow on my Mac.  I have python 2.7 and python 3.4, both installed with Homebrew.  I tried brew install pillow and it worked fine, but only for python 2.7.  I haven't been able to find a way to install it for python 3.  I tried brew install pillow3 but no luck.  I've found a post on SO that says to first install pip3 with Homebrew and then use pip3 install pillow.  As it happens, I have already installed pip3.
I've never understood the difference, if any, between installing a python package  with pip and installing it with Homebrew.  Can you explain it to me?  Also, is it preferable to install with Homebrew if a formula is available?  If installing with Homebrew is indeed preferable, do you know how to install pillow for python 3 with Homebrew?
The first answers indicate that I haven't made myself plain.  If I had installed pillow with pip install pillow instead of brew install pillow would the installation on my system be any different?  Why would Homebrew make a formula that does something that pip already does?  Would it check for additional prerequisites or something?  Why is there a formula for pillow with python2, but not as far as I can tell for pillow with python3?
Assistant: Homebrew is a package manager, similar to apt on ubuntu or yum on some other linux distros. Pip is also a package manager, but is specific to python packages. Homebrew can be used to install a variety of things such as databases like MySQL and mongodb or webservers like apache or nginx.
