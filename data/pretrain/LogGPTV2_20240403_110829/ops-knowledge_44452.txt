User: How to run celery worker on Windows without creating Windows Service? Is there any analogy to $ celery -A your_application worker?
Assistant: I have run celery task using RabbitMQ server.
RabbitMq is better and simple than redis broker
while running celery use this command "celery -A project-name worker --pool=solo -l info"
and avoid this command "celery -A project-name worker --loglevel info"
