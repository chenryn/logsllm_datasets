User: I have a tool which I have written in python and generally should be run as a daemon.  What are the best practices for packaging this tool for distribution, particularly how should settings files and the daemon executable/script be handled?
Relatedly are there any common tools for setting up the daemon for running on boot as appropriate for the given platform (i.e. init scripts on linux, services on windows, launchd on os x)?
Assistant: correct me if wrong, but I believe the question is how to DEPLOY the daemon.  Set your app to install via pip and then make the entry_point a cli(daemon()).  Then create an init script that simply runs $app_name &
