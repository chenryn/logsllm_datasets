Abstract—A  central  element  of  designing  IT  security  in-
frastructures  is  the  logical  segmentation  of  information  assets 
into  network  zones  sharing  the  same  security  requirements  and 
policies. As more business ecosystems are migrated to the cloud, 
additional  demands  for  cybersecurity  emerge  and  make  the 
network-zone  operation  and  management  for  large  corporate 
networks challenging. In this paper, we introduce the new concept 
of  an  inter-domain  transit  zone  that  securely  bridges  physically 
and  logically  non-adjacent  zones  in  large-scale  information  sys-
tems,  simplifying  complex  network-zone  structures.  With  inter-
zone  translation  points,  we  also  ensure  communication  integrity 
and  conﬁdentiality  while  providing  lightweight  security-policy 
enforcement. A logically centralized network coordinator enables 
scalable  and  ﬂexible  network  management.  Our  implementation 
demonstrates  that  the  new  architecture  merely  introduces  a  few 
microseconds  of  additional  processing  delay  in  transit.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Network  zoning  has  long  been  an  essential  part  of  the 
Internet  security  infrastructure,  which  logically  partitions  net-
work  and  information  assets  into  disjoint  segments  that  share 
the  same  security  requirements  and  policies,  and  functional 
similarities. Zones deﬁne the network boundaries and their de-
fense requirements by explicitly stating the entities populating 
the  zones,  the  entry  points  into  the  zone,  and  how  trafﬁc  is 
monitored  and  ﬁltered  at  these  entry  points.  Informally,  these 
zones  are  realized  by  a  virtualized  separation  at  layer  2  (e.g., 
IEEE  802.1q  [28])  with  ﬁrewalls  at  higher  levels  governing 
data  transfers  between  zones  [40].
Each  zone  is  associated  with  a  security  level.  By  default, 
a  host  within  a  zone  with  a  low  security  level  cannot  access 
a higher security zone. To realize access control based on the 
security  level,  ﬁrewalls  are  considered  to  be  the  most  viable 
technology. However, operating ﬁrewalls in large enterprises is 
often challenging for network operators and security architects. 
The access control for network zones might be dynamic, which 
requires  complex  management  schemes  to  accommodate  a 
myriad  of  policies.  While  there  are  advanced  technologies 
such as virtual ﬁrewalls [3], [12], distributed security enforce-
ment [38], [69], and Uniﬁed Threat Management (UTM) [53], 
newly designed to enforce access control polices in extremely 
dynamic  networks,  network  zone  management  and  modeling 
still  remains  cumbersome  [21],  [54].

the Internet),
Bridging geographically distant network zones is very
challenging today. In general, network zones are created not
only for security purposes but also because of geographi-
cal, operational, or organizational factors. Large enterprises
with geographically distributed branch networks, and possibly
collaborative partners’ networks need to be interconnected.
Given that distant network zones exchange information over
an untrusted network (e.g.,
there is a risk
that the communication exposes security-sensitive informa-
tion during transit. To mitigate such threats, administrators
leverage additional security mechanisms (e.g., IPsec [32] and
TLS-VPN [55]) which ensure conﬁdentiality and integrity of
the transmission over the untrusted network by encrypting
and authenticating the data with shared cryptographic keys.
Nonetheless, these technologies bring forth new challenges
such as management scalability [19] and compatibility issues
with other security solutions [34]—universal agreement with
business partners on building collaborative security infrastruc-
ture is often problematic.
MONDRIAN is a new network zoning architecture that
secures inter-zone communication—which operates on layer
3, supporting heterogeneous layer 2 architectures—while en-
suring scalable cryptographic-key management and ﬂexible
security policy enforcement. MONDRIAN ﬂattens the current
hierarchically-complex network zone topology into a collection
of horizontal zones connected to a uniﬁed security gateway,
called Zone Translation Point (TP), thus simplifying large
enterprise networks. By interconnecting zones through TPs,
complex zone restructuring operations become easier with
respect to new zone initializations or zone migrations. The
TP ensures source authentication, zone transition authoriza-
tion, and illegitimate access ﬁltering by acting as a secure
ingress/egress point for network zones. A logically centralized
control unit provides management scalability on zone classi-
ﬁcation and policy enforcement, and mediates cryptographic
key establishment. Since poor security practices, complicated
controls, and rushed updates cause security breaches [37], the
management scalability and ﬂexibility offered by MONDRIAN
provide strong, transparent, and efﬁcient controls, minimizing
human error and enhancing the security of enterprise networks.
A secure zone transition is performed in three steps: i) the
TP acquires access policies for each network zone from its
controller, ii) the TP issues a cryptographically protected au-
thorization token if a given zone transition request is permitted,
and iii) the network forwards only packets with a valid token.
By leveraging the notion of secure tunneling between two
endpoints (i.e., a pair of local and remote TPs), conﬁdentiality
and integrity of the zone transition packets are ensured, while
keeping the overhead of the authentication process small. For
scalable key management, we employ a key establishment
system that enables dynamic key derivation and ensures perfect
forward secrecy.
We provide an implementation of MONDRIAN that ensures
secure zone transition for both intra- and inter-domain commu-
nication at line rate, while requiring no network-stack changes
from end hosts. We extensively evaluate this implementation to
demonstrate the practical viability of MONDRIAN. The results
show that the TP introduces negligible processing delay; less
than 500 ns of additional delay for intra-domain zone transition
and approximately 2.5 ∼ 3µs for inter-domain zone transition.
We further provide in-depth analyses for security and practical
considerations.
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
• We introduce MONDRIAN, a new security architecture
that enables secure, ﬂexible and viable network zoning
and inter-zone communication for large enterprise
networks.
• We introduce an inter-domain transit zone that simpli-
ﬁes the current hierarchical zone structure, enabling
ﬂexible network zone management.
• We implement MONDRIAN as an opensource project.
II. NETWORK ZONING
Using a case study we explore how network zoning is
realized in modern enterprise networks, and later we derive
the main challenges we confront.
A. Case Study
Most enterprise networks have embraced the notion of
layered security classiﬁcation, that can be broadly split into
intranet, extranet, and opennet [54]. The opennet is the least
trusted network (e.g., the Internet) which is an inhospitable
region where live threats exist, whereas the intranet is the most
trusted network hosting business-critical systems and sensitive
information. Since the intranet has rigorous access control
mechanisms to protect information assets from exposure to
the opennet, enterprises are forced to operate another security
layer (extranet, also known as demilitarized zone or DMZ) in
between, which exposes the publicly accessible services to the
opennet, while reducing the attack surface.
Over time,
the layered network structure has become
more sophisticated [45] due to extreme changes in network
environments—diverse demands from customers, partners and
employees accessing enterprise networks with a variety of
devices. As a result, many enterprise networks comprise a large
number of zones deﬁned by operational, organizational, and
most importantly security factors. Figure 1 depicts a real-world
use case for network zones running on inter-domain level with
multiple involved autonomous systems (ASes). Zone transition
can be categorized into three main types.
Intra-domain Zone Transition. Within a local network,
multiple devices such as servers, databases, and hosts are
connected through network switches. These devices are as-
signed with a unique IP address that belongs to a logically

zones are realized with heavy use of security middleboxes
(e.g., Firewalls).
isolated network zone. These zones commonly consist of
multiple subnets, often realized with a layer 2 virtualization
technology (e.g., VLAN). Each zone is protected by a set
of security middleboxes, e.g., ﬁrewalls, intrusion-prevention
systems (IPS), and intrusion-detection systems (IDS), which
enforce predeﬁned security policies for all
trafﬁc passing
through.
To maintain the zone-based trust model, an access per-
mission to one zone is not considered to be valid for other
zones. That is, an entity must obtain access permissions from
all zones on the path when accessing a non-adjacent zone. This
trust model however often complicates policy management
and enforcement, especially for large enterprise networks. To
resolve this complication, the current practice introduces the
notion of a dedicated zone transition point, called Transit Zone.
A Transit Zone acts like a patch panel allowing zones to be
interconnected without the need of a dedicated link between
each pair of zones. The Transit Zone sits in the middle of
multiple zones and mediates access between zones that need
to communicate with each other. It is commonly comprised of
only forwarding devices (e.g., switches), interconnecting the
attached zones via various ingress/egress points on which se-
curity middleboxes enforce the security policies. In a nutshell,
the Transit Zone reduces the depth of zone hierarchies and
thus simpliﬁes the network zone design and management.
Inter-domain Zone Transition. To ensure that geographically
distributed zones can securely communicate with each other,
enterprises employ various networking technologies. The most
common choice is connecting two remote sites with a physical
leased line, (e.g., Layer 2 circuit). Enterprises can lease these
lines from Internet service providers and make use of them
to bridge local networks. However, purchasing leased lines is
costly and might raise trust issues towards the service provider.
An alternative is a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN
uses encryption and authentication to create a virtual tunnel
between two local networks, thwarting information leakage
during transmission over the public Internet. While a VPN
can achieve data conﬁdentiality, typically yet another layer
of overlay protocols is required to achieve virtual separation
of zones. The use of such overlay protocols, however, has
the disadvantage that all interconnected sites need to deploy
the same protocol since such protocols generally do not offer
interoperability.
Trafﬁc from the Internet. Trafﬁc not originating from coop-
erative (trusted) networks can be classiﬁed into the following
three types: i) public trafﬁc, ii) authorized trafﬁc, and iii)
malicious trafﬁc. The ﬁrst case covers customers who access
the enterprise’s public services, e.g., Web servers. This trafﬁc
in general ends up at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) hosting
only public services that require exposure to the Internet.
The second case refers to the trafﬁc coming from temporarily
authorized devices. For example, a legitimate employee outside
the enterprise’s premises—working from home with a personal
device—may get a temporal permit to access restricted zones
via a VPN. The last category comprises attack packets which
are to be ﬁltered by the security middleboxes in the frontline
of defense.
B. Challenges
Secure Zone Transition. Transmitting security-sensitive data
between zones in different physical locations (e.g., data center
to branch site) over the public Internet poses a challenge.
Security level information is lost in transit, requiring that the
data is re-authenticated and ﬁltered again on the receiving
site even though source and destination could be part of the
same logical zone. Today’s overlay protocols are often used to
overcome the restriction of losing security level information
in transit. This however introduces new challenges: difﬁculties
in deployment per zone, computational overhead, and poor
management scalability.
Interoperability. To support seamless interconnection between
security zones in different networks, we consider interoperabil-
ity as another challenge. Even if security-level information per-
sists in transit, different zones might not be built on the same
internal protocols. For example, large enterprise networks often
lease a physical network infrastructure from Internet service
providers or cloud service providers, in which a different layer-
2 protocol is running (e.g., Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) [27]
vs. Trill [48]). The use of different protocols eventually results
in the incompatibility of zone translation and makes it difﬁcult
for end systems in different zones to communicate with each
other seamlessly.
Management Scalability. In current
local network zoning
architectures, administration is being considered a tedious,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive task. For example, simply
adding a new zone might require existing policies to be
thoroughly reviewed, updated, and re-distributed to the local
network entities. The management complexity dramatically
increases in a wide-area network (WAN) environment.
III. OVERVIEW
This section provides an overview of MONDRIAN. We ﬁrst
elaborate on the fundamental goals of this research, along
with requirements, and design choices (§III-A). We then sketch
MONDRIAN including a brief introduction of each component
and associated workﬂow (§III-B). Finally, we describe our
threat model (§III-C) and state our assumptions (§III-D).
A. Design Principles
Goal. The fundamental goal of this work is to build an
architecture that weds local network zoning with inter-domain
routing to achieve lightweight interoperability, secure zone

transition, and incremental deployability—thereby enabling
secure, scalable, and ﬂexible network zoning on a global scale.
That is, an administration domain expresses zone deﬁnitions
and corresponding zone transition rules, and deploys the
policies to distributed network entities. These policies force
the network to only forward authorized packets protected by
cryptographically secured authenticators, ensuring secure and
sustainable zone-to-zone communication.
Desired Properties. We consider the following properties to
achieve this goal.
•
•
Data conﬁdentiality: through a constructive approach,
the zone transition protocol ensures that no informa-
tion is exposed while being transmitted via the public
Internet.
•
• Management scalability: logically centralized orches-
tration empowers network administrators to easily
migrate network topologies, update policies and mirror
abstract network zones into the real network.
Efﬁciency: the cryptographic primitives introduce only
minor performance overhead in terms of latency, band-
width, and operational costs.
Deployability: the MONDRIAN architecture requires
minimal changes to the existing network infrastruc-
ture in order to achieve compatibility. Furthermore,
ﬁrewalls and VPN devices at each entry point of every
zone can be replaced with one MONDRIAN gateway,
saving operational costs for the same level of network
security.
