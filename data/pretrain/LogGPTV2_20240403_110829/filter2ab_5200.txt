### Title: BLEEDINGBIT: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Enterprise Wi-Fi Access Points

In recent years, enterprise Wi-Fi access points equipped with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chips have become increasingly prevalent. While these chips offer new functionalities, they also introduce security risks, creating a new attack surface for potential threats. In this presentation, we will demonstrate BLEEDINGBIT, a set of two zero-day vulnerabilities in Texas Instruments' (TI) BLE chips, which are used in Cisco, Meraki, and Aruba wireless access points. These vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to an enterprise network over the air.

The first BLEEDINGBIT vulnerability was identified in the BLE stack embedded in TI chips used in Cisco and Meruki Wi-Fi access points. The second vulnerability was found in TI's Over-the-Air Firmware Download (OAD) feature, which is utilized by nearly all Aruba Wi-Fi access points currently on the market. Collectively, these vendors account for approximately 80% of the wireless access points sold annually to enterprises.

By exploiting BLEEDINGBIT, an attacker can first achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the BLE chip. From there, the attacker can leverage the compromised BLE chip to take control of the main operating system of the access point, thereby gaining full control over it. Once the access point is compromised, the attacker can intercept and read all traffic passing through it, distribute malware, and even move laterally between different network segments.

While initially discovered in wireless access points, BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities may also be present in a wide range of devices and equipment used across various industries. For example, medical centers use BLE to track the location of valuable assets such as resuscitation carts. Retailers employ BLE for mobile credit card readers and indoor navigation applications. A BLEEDINGBIT attack on any of these devices could occur without warning, bypassing existing security controls and leaving organizations vulnerable.

This presentation will provide a detailed analysis of the BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and recommendations for mitigating the associated risks.
