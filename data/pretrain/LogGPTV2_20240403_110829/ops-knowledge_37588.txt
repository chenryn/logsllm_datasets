User: I am on windows with Python 2.5. I have an open file for writing. I write some data. Call file close. When I try to delete the file from the folder using Windows Explorer, it errors, saying that a process still holds a handle to the file.
If I shutdown python, and try again, it succeeds.
Assistant: It does close them.
Are you sure f.close() is getting called?
I just tested the same scenario and windows deletes the file for me.
