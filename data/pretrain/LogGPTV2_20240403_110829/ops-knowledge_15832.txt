User: I'm processing requests in Tornado that comes with Content-Encoding: gzip header in the body request. The problem is that Tornado shows a warning:

[W 150713 17:22:11 httputil:687] Unsupported Content-Encoding: gzip

I'm doing the unzip operation inside the code and it works like a charm but I'd like to get rid of the message.
Is there any way of accepting that Content-Encoding in Tornado? 
Thanks!
Assistant: You must opt-in to handling of gzipped requests by passing decompress_request=True to the HTTPServer constructor (or Application.listen).
