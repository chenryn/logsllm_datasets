User: Is there a equatable bit of code to GetSystemMetrics in win32api, for Ubuntu?  I need to get the monitors width and height in pixels.
Assistant: I assume you're a GUI toolkit. Why else would you be interested in the screen dimensions?
Check out gtk.gdk.screen_width() and gtk.gdk.screen_height() from PyGTK. Something similar should be available for QT.
