### 3.2.3 Threat Actor Classifications

The previous section introduced threats and threat actors. Cybersecurity professionals are primarily interested in threat actors, as most threats to systems, networks, and enterprises are human. Key attributes of cybercrime compared to physical crime include anonymity, the ability to execute attacks remotely, and typically a lack of physical danger and monetary cost.

There are various types of threat actors, each with different levels of technical sophistication, resources, motivations, and ethical frameworks. While it is impossible to list every type of threat actor, several high-level classifications are essential to understand:

#### Individual Malicious Actors
Anyone attempting unauthorized actions fits into this category. In cybersecurity, malicious actors can exploit unintended digital tactics, such as authenticating to restricted services, stealing credentials, and defacing websites.

**Example: Paige Thompson**
In July 2019, Paige Thompson was arrested for exploiting a router with unnecessarily high privileges to download the private information of 100 million people from Capital One. This attack led to the loss of personal information, including SSNs, account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The attack was partly enabled by a misconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) with excessive permissions. It could have been prevented by applying the principle of least privilege and verifying the correct configuration of the WAF. Additionally, social media monitoring could have detected the attacker's posts about their actions.

#### Malicious Groups
When individuals form groups, they often become more powerful than their individual members. This is particularly true online, where instant communication tools enable coordination and goal achievement that would be impossible otherwise. For example, the ability to quickly coordinate tasks via instant messaging is valuable for both malicious cyber groups and modern businesses. Malicious groups are usually more purposeful, organized, and resourceful than individuals, making them one of the more dangerous threat actors.

**Example: Lapsus$ Group**
Over several months, the "Lapsus$" group conducted multiple attacks on various companies, stealing proprietary information and engaging in extortion. These attacks resulted in the loss of corporate data, public exposure, and financial losses for companies that submitted to extortion. The variety and sophistication of techniques used by the group highlight the danger of such actors. Palo Alto Networks suggests focusing on security best practices such as MFA, access control, and network segmentation to mitigate such attacks.

#### Insider Threats
Insider threats are individuals with privileged access who abuse their privileges to attack a system. Often, these are current or former employees motivated to harm the enterprise. Insider threats are particularly dangerous because they are usually trusted, which can be exploited to gain further access or use internal knowledge not meant for public disclosure.

**Example: Christopher Dobbins**
During the PPE shortage in March 2020, Christopher Dobbins, a recently fired Vice President of a medical packaging company, used a fake account to access company systems and alter critical data, delaying the delivery of medical supplies. This attack could have been prevented by applying the principle of least privilege, rigorously auditing accounts, and better monitoring for anomalous activity.

#### Nation States
Nation-state actors are among the most proficient, resourceful, and well-financed operators of cyber attacks. Since 2009, North Korean threat actors, often grouped under the name Lazarus, have engaged in various attacks, including data theft, ransomware, and financial theft. NCC Group recommends steps such as network segmentation, patching, MFA, and monitoring for anomalous behavior to prevent or mitigate such attacks.

### 3.2.4 Recent Cybersecurity Breaches

While the previous section focused on who performs attacks, this section covers different kinds of breaches that have occurred in recent years. We will analyze some recent cybersecurity attacks, discuss their impact, and consider how they could have been prevented or mitigated.

#### Social Engineering
Social engineering involves persuading or manipulating victims to provide information or access they should not have.

**Example: Twitter Breach (July 2021)**
Attackers used spearphishing to gain access to an internal Twitter tool, allowing them to reset passwords for high-profile accounts and promote a Bitcoin scam. The attack caused financial losses, data exposure, and reputational damage. Prevention measures include better employee training, limiting access to sensitive tools, and increased monitoring for anomalous activity.

#### Phishing
Phishing is a broader class of attack where malicious communications are sent to many people, increasing the likelihood of a victim clicking a link or taking an action that compromises security.

**Example: Toyota Subsidiary (September 2021)**
A Toyota subsidiary fell prey to a Business Email Compromise (BEC) phishing scam, resulting in a transfer of ¥4 billion (approximately $37 million USD). The FBI recommends verifying the legitimacy of requests, being wary of urgent requests, and carefully inspecting email addresses and URLs.

#### Ransomware
Ransomware is malware that locks users out of their systems and demands a ransom for access.

**Example: Colonial Pipeline (May 2021)**
A ransomware incident at Colonial Pipeline disrupted fuel distribution for multiple days, leading to corporate data loss, halted fuel distribution, ransom payments, and increased fuel prices. The attack could have been prevented by enabling MFA and prohibiting password reuse.

#### Credential Abuse
Credential abuse occurs when attackers acquire legitimate credentials, allowing them to log into systems they should not be able to access.

**Example: SolarWinds (December 2020)**
Malicious updates in the SolarWinds Orion platform allowed malware to be installed on customer environments, compromising numerous organizations, including US government agencies. The attack resulted from a weak password exposed on GitHub. Prevention measures include ensuring strong passwords and monitoring for leaked secrets.

#### Authentication Bypass
Authentication bypass allows attackers to ignore or circumvent intended authentication protocols.

**Example: Kaseya VSA (July 2021)**
An attack on Kaseya’s VSA remote management tool bypassed the authentication system, pushing REvil ransomware to endpoints. The vulnerability had been known for at least three months. Timely and urgent fixes for known vulnerabilities could have prevented this attack.

### 3.3 The CIA Triad

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
- Understand why it’s important to protect the confidentiality of information
- Learn why it’s important to protect the integrity of information
- Explore why it’s important to protect the availability of information

To understand offensive techniques, we need to know the principles defenders should follow to identify opportunities to exploit their mistakes. Similarly, good defenders benefit from understanding how attackers operate, including their biases and errors.

The CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—is a model used to describe the relationship between security and its objects. Each attribute is a desirable property of the things we want to secure, and each can be attacked. Most attacks against computer systems and networks threaten one of these attributes. Let’s begin with a high-level overview:

- **Confidentiality**: Can actors who should not have access to the system or information access it?
- **Integrity**: Can the data or the system be modified in an unintended way?
- **Availability**: Are the data or the system accessible when and how they are intended to be?

In some cases, one aspect of the CIA triad may be more critical than others. For example, the confidentiality of a personal journal may be more important than its integrity or availability. Conversely, the integrity of a system tracking medical prescriptions is crucial, as unauthorized modifications could have life-threatening consequences.

When securing a system and an issue is discovered, it is important to consider which of these concepts, or which combination, the issue impacts. This helps in understanding the problem comprehensively and allows for appropriate categorization and response.

#### 3.3.1 Confidentiality
A system is confidential if only explicitly permitted individuals can access it. A person’s social media account credentials are confidential as long as the password is known only to the owner. Common attacks against confidentiality include network eavesdropping and credential stuffing.
