When setting the `facecolor` of a patch with an alpha value, for example:

```python
facecolor=(1, 0, 0, 0.5)
```

the alpha value is ignored. Instead, only the patch's `_alpha` property is used. This behavior makes it impossible to create a patch with an opaque edge and a partially transparent fill.

I have only tested this issue using the TkAgg backend.
