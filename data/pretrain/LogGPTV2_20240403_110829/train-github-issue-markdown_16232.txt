If you set the facecolor of a patch with an alpha value, e.g.
    facecolor=(1,0,0,0.5)
the alpha value is ignored; only the patch's `_alpha` property is used. This
makes it impossible to have a patch with an opaque edge and a (partially)
transparent fill.
I've only tested this on the TkAgg backend.
