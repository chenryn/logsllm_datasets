pass filter to keep the high-frequency voltage ripples introduced
by servers’ PFC circuits, while removing the nominal UPS output
voltage frequencies and harmonics. Thus, with a high-pass filter,
the line voltage components VAB, VBC, and VCA becomes almost
zero. Next, by using ˜x to represent the filtered version of x that only
keeps frequency components around the servers’ PFC switching
frequencies, we get the following relations:
˜Vab ≈ −RL · (2˜Iab − ˜Ibc − ˜Ica)
≈ −RL · (−˜Iab + 2˜Ibc − ˜Ica)
˜Vbc
˜Vca ≈ −RL · (−˜Iab − ˜Ibc + 2˜Ica).
Thus, by collecting the ˜Vab, ˜Vbc and ˜Vca signals using its voltage
probes, the attacker can easily solve the above equation set and
extract the high-frequency voltage ripple signals (i.e., RL · ˜Iab, RL ·
˜Ibc, and RL · ˜Ica) resulting from the server clusters’ power usage.
Consequently, based on the approach proposed in Section 4,
the total power usage of each server cluster at runtime can be
tracked and, when combined together, provides the attacker with
an estimate of the total PDU-level power usage for timing its attacks.
In summary, even in the most complicated three-phase power
distribution system, the benign tenants’ aggregate power usage can be
extracted by the attacker through our discovered voltage side channel
for precisely timing its attacks.3
3To exploit the voltage side channel in the three-phase system illustrated in Fig. 18,
the attacker needs to house at least one server rack in each of the three server clusters
(e.g., by pretending to be three tenants) to measure cluster-wise voltage signals.

6.2 Evaluation Results
In Section 6.1.2, we have provided a theoretical foundation for
timing power attacks based on a voltage side channel in three-
phase data centers. Next, we evaluate the timing accuracy of the
voltage side channel.
6.2.1 Methodology. We only have a limited access to a large multi-
tenant data center with three-phase power distribution and cannot
perform experiments due to the destructing nature of our research.
Hence, we re-use the experimental results from our servers that
have three different types of power supply units. Concretely, we
generate three different sets of server power and voltage signal
traces based on experiments done on our single-phase server setup
with 13 servers. To simulate a large three-phase system, we make
50 copies for each set of trace and add 10% randomness in the power
load and PFC switching frequency for each copy. The randomness
accounts for the heterogeneity in servers’ power supply units and
PFC switching frequencies in large systems. Hence, each set of
server power and voltage signal traces obtained through our experi-
ments are essentially scaled up by 50 times, and represent the power
loads and voltage signals of one server cluster in the three-phase
system. Therefore, the three-phase system under consideration has
650 servers (50 times of our single-phase experiment) in each of
the three clusters.
In our simulation, the attacker has at least one server rack in each
cluster and can measure the phase-to-phase voltages (Vab, Vbc, and
Vca). Since each server rack is connected to two different phases and
the phase voltages are affected by multiple server clusters (hence,
multiple power-voltage traces), we use the three-phase voltage
equations in Section 6.1.1 to generate the attacker’s voltage mea-
surements (Vab, Vbc, and Vca). Note that, while we consider the UPS
supplies a balanced three-phase voltage (i.e., VAB = VBC = VCA,
with a 120◦ phase difference), the supplied voltage is eliminated
from the filtered voltages ( ˜Vab, ˜Vbc, and ˜Vca) which the attacker
uses for extracting the server clusters’ power usage. The benign
tenants and attacker are scaled proportionally according to the
composition in Table 1. The resulting attack opportunities take up
7.5% of the time.
6.2.2 Results. Due to the space limitation, we only show the most
important results — timing accuracy. Specifically, Fig. 19 shows
the true positive and precision rates under different triggering
thresholds. We see that, compared to the results in Fig. 14, the
timing accuracy is still reasonably good although it becomes a
bit worse in the three-phase system. This is mainly due to the
randomness added in the power and PSD data when scaling up our
edge data center to a large multi-tenant data center, and also due to
the fact the attacker needs to track the power usage of three server
clusters rather in a three-phase system.
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the voltage side chan-
nel in terms of timing power attacks in a three-phase system. This
matches with our expectation, because the high-frequency voltage
ripples generated by servers’ PFC circuits exist both in single-phase
and three-phase systems and these voltage ripple signals can be
transmitted over the data center power line network.
7 DEFENSE STRATEGY
To mitigate the threat of well-timed power attacks, we highlight a
few possible defense strategies to degrade the voltage side channel
and, more generally, against power attacks.
DC power distribution. The PFC circuit universally built in to-
day’s server power supply units is the root cause for high-frequency
voltage ripple signals that leak server power usage information
through the power lines (i.e., voltage side channel). Thus, the volt-
age side channel may be eliminated by adopting DC power distribu-
tions where the AC to DC conversion is done at the UPS rather than
at the server end, as illustrated in Fig. 26 in Appendix G. Naturally,
given DC power distributions, the PFC circuit is no longer needed
in a server power supply unit. While this is effective for contain-
ing the voltage side channel, it requires a holistic industry-wide
change, including an entirely new set of power distribution system
as well as new power supply units for every server. Thus, we do
not anticipate this change will happen any time soon.
Modifying power supply unit. Another approach to getting
rid of the voltage side channel is to modify/update the power supply
unit design for removing current/voltage ripples. However, it could
be challenging to find a suitable substitute for existing mature
design. Further, it also requires an industry-wide swap of power
supply units, which is highly unlikely in practice.
Jamming signal and filtering. Inspired by jamming attack in
communications [50], an inexpensive alternative to the above DC
power distribution is to add PSD noise to the PDU and UPS distribu-
tion buses around the servers’ PFC switching frequency range (e.g.,
40kHz to 100kHz). Also, using advanced signal processing tech-
niques and detection, antiphase voltage signal can be injected at
the PDU to cancel out the PSD spikes due to server loads. Nonethe-
less, this may require modification/upgrade of the existing power
distribution equipment. In addition, adding jamming signals may
reduce the overall power factor of the data center and incur more
power losses. Another approach is to install low-pass filters to pre-
vent high-frequency voltage ripple signals from entering the data
center power network but, if improperly chosen, the filters may
also block legitimate communications (e.g., for network manage-
ment [43]). Moreover, in practice, filters can reduce the strengths of
high-frequency voltage ripples but not completely eliminate them.
Infrastructure reinforcement. Since power attacks target to
exploit the data center power infrastructure vulnerability (due to
the common practice of oversubscription [14, 15, 17]), another nat-
ural approach is to strengthen the infrastructure against power
attacks. Toward this end, additional investment can be made to
increase the infrastructure redundancy (e.g., installing extra UPSes),
but this comes at a great capital expense and can be especially chal-
lenging for existing data centers. Moreover, it is a passive defense:

center availability, though actual outages may occur less frequently.
Attacker identification. A more proactive approach is to iden-
tify attackers inside the data center and evict them in the first place.
For example, high-granularity monitoring and rigorous analysis
of tenants’ power usage can expose a tenant’s malicious intention.
The main challenge here is to distinguish an attacker from benign
tenants because the attacker also follows all contractual limits and
can behave like a benign tenant in terms of power usage. In addi-
tion, it is even more difficult to identify an attacker if the attacker
houses its servers in different racks (pretending to be multiple dif-
ferent benign tenants) and/or launches well-timed power attacks by
increasing benign tenants’ power usage through request flooding
(instead of only relying on the attacker’s own power capacity).
To conclude, it is non-trivial to defend data center power infras-
tructures against power attacks timed through a voltage side channel.
Thus, effective and inexpensive defense strategies are one of the
future research directions in data center power security [7–11].
8 RELATED WORK
Power capping. Power infrastructure oversubscription has been
extensively applied for increasing capacity utilization. To handle
the ensuing possible capacity overloads, power capping has been
proposed, such as throttling CPU [14, 19], rerouting workloads [45],
and partially offloading power demand to energy storages [51–53].
However, these techniques cannot be applied in multi-tenant data
centers due to the operator’s lack of control over tenants’ servers.
While [15] proposes a market approach for handling capacity over-
loads in multi-tenant data centers, the market assumes that all
tenants are benign and, more crucially, broadcasts the data center’s
high-power periods (i.e., attack opportunities) unsuspectingly to
all tenants including possibly an attacker.
Data center security. Securing data centers in the cyber do-
main has been widely studied to defend against attacks such as
DDoS [3, 4], and data stealing and privacy breach [5, 35, 54, 55].
Meanwhile, an emerging attack vector has been malicious power
loads that target the oversubscribed data center power infrastruc-
tures to create outages. Studies [7, 9, 10, 36] investigate how VMs
can be used to create power overloads in cloud data centers. An-
other two recent works [8, 11] exploit physical side channels in
multi-tenant data centers to time power attacks. In contrast, we
propose a novel voltage side channel that is not sensitive to external
disturbances, does not require any offline modeling, does not suffer
from time lag, and can accurately track power shapes of multiple
tenants. A detailed comparison between our work and these related
studies is provided in Sections 2.3 and 3.
Power management in multi-tenant data centers. Finally,
our work furthers the growing literature on power management
in multi-tenant data centers. While the recent studies have pre-
dominantly focused on improving power/energy efficiency and
reducing cost [15, 56–59], we focus on the complementary aspect
of its physical security against devastating power attacks.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we consider the emerging threat of power attacks in
multi-tenant data centers. We discover a novel voltage side channel
resulting from the high-frequency switching operation in the PFC
circuit of a server’s power supply unit. The voltage side channel
can accurately track benign tenants’ power usage and helps the
attacker precisely time its power attacks. Our experiment results on
a prototype edge data center show that an attacker can effectively
use the voltage side channel to utilize 64% of the power attack
opportunities. We also highlight a few defense strategies and extend
to more complex three-phase power distribution systems.
