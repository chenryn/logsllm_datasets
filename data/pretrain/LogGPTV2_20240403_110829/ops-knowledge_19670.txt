User: I just downloaded and installed Anaconda on my Windows computer. However, I am having trouble executing .py files using the command prompt. How can I get my computer to understand that the python.exe application is in the Anaconda folder so it can execute my .py files?
Assistant: Right click on a .py file and choose 'open with'
Scroll down through the list of applications and click something like 'use a different program'
Naviage to C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3
click on python.exe and then click on 'ok' or 'open'
Now when you double click on any .py file it will run it through Anaconda's interpreter and therefore run the python code.
I presume if you run it through the command line the same would apply but perhaps someone could correct me?
