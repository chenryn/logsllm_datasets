On Windows 8.1, with a high DPI screen, min-width/min-height behave wrongly -
the value is multiplied by the current DPI over standard DPI, resolving in
higher actual values.
For example, when the min-width is set to 1000, the system has a resolution
width 2560, but Electron renders as if the width of the screen is around 1330
(so that things do not appear to small), the actual window width based on min-
width resolves in around 1500px, but the actual window comes up wider than the
screen because the width is already re-calculated according to this.
The point is, min-width/min-height shouldn't be re-calculated according to DPI
since width/height of the window already are.
