### Largest Connected Component in the Drunkard Model

The largest connected component, expressed as a fraction of \( n \), was analyzed for increasing values of \( l \) in the drunkard model. For large values of \( l \), the average size of the largest connected component is approximately 0.9\( n \). However, if the transmitting range is reduced to \( r_0 \), the size of the largest connected component drops to about 0.5\( n \).

We also examined the transmitting ranges that ensure the average size of the largest connected component is 0.9\( n \), 0.75\( n \), and 0.5\( n \), respectively. These transmitting ranges are denoted as \( r_{l90} \), \( r_{l75} \), and \( r_{l50} \). The mobility parameters and \( n \) were set as described above. The rationale behind this investigation is that network designers might be interested in maintaining only a certain fraction of nodes connected to achieve significant energy savings. Additionally, in scenarios such as wireless sensor networks where the cost of a node is very low, it may be feasible and cost-effective to deploy twice as many nodes as needed and set the transmitting ranges so that half of the nodes remain connected.

### Ratio of Transmitting Ranges in the Random Waypoint Model

Figure 6 shows the ratio of \( r_{l90} \), \( r_{l75} \), and \( r_{l50} \) to \( r_{\text{stationary}} \) for increasing values of \( l \) in the random waypoint model. Simulation results indicate that while \( r_{l90}/r_{\text{stationary}} \) tends to decrease with increasing values of \( l \), converging to about 0.52, the ratios \( r_{l75}/r_{\text{stationary}} \) and \( r_{l50}/r_{\text{stationary}} \) are almost independent of \( l \). Specifically, \( r_{l75}/r_{\text{stationary}} \) is about 0.46 and \( r_{l50}/r_{\text{stationary}} \) is about 0.4. The relative differences between the three ratios decrease as \( l \) increases. This suggests that for small networks (few nodes distributed in a relatively small region), the energy required to maintain 90% of the nodes connected is significantly higher than that required to connect 50% of the nodes. For large networks, the energy savings are less pronounced if the connectivity requirement is only 50% of the nodes.

### Simulation Results for Different Mobility Patterns

A second set of simulations was conducted to investigate the effect of different mobility parameters on the value of \( r_{100} \). We considered the random waypoint model with \( l = 4096 \) and \( n = 64 \). The default values of the mobility parameters were set as follows: \( p_{\text{stationary}} = 0 \), \( v_{\min} = 0.1 \), \( v_{\max} = 0.01l \), and \( t_{\text{pause}} = 2000 \). We then varied one parameter at a time, keeping the others constant.

Figure 7 reports the value of \( r_{100} \) for values of \( p_{\text{stationary}} \) ranging from 0 (no stationary nodes) to 1 (corresponding to the stationary case) in steps of 0.2. Simulation results show a sharp drop in \( r_{100} \) in the interval 0.4-0.6: for \( p_{\text{stationary}} = 0.4 \), \( r_{100} \) is about 10% larger than \( r_{\text{stationary}} \), while for \( p_{\text{stationary}} = 0.6 \) and higher values, \( r_{100} \approx r_{\text{stationary}} \). To investigate this drop more closely, we performed additional simulations by exploring the interval 0.4-0.6 in steps of 0.02. As shown in Figure 7, there is a distinct threshold phenomenon: when the number of stationary nodes is about \( n/2 \) or higher, the network can be regarded as practically stationary from a connectedness point of view. This result is interesting because it suggests that a certain number (albeit a large fraction) of stationary nodes can significantly increase network connectedness. With more than \( n/2 \) mobile nodes, the network quickly becomes equivalent to one in which all nodes are mobile.

Figures 8 and 9 show the effect of \( t_{\text{pause}} \) and velocity on \( r_{100} \). Increasing values of \( t_{\text{pause}} \) tend to decrease the value of \( r_{100} \), although the trend is not as pronounced as in the case of \( p_{\text{stationary}} \). A threshold phenomenon seems to exist in the interval 4000-6000, but further simulations in this interval have shown that, although the trend can be observed, no sharp threshold actually exists. We believe the reason for this is that while the value of \( p_{\text{stationary}} \) has a direct impact on the "quantity of mobility" (informally understood as the percentage of stationary nodes with respect to the total number of nodes), the effect of the pause time is not as direct. In the random waypoint model, the "quantity of mobility" depends heavily on the node destinations, which are chosen uniformly at random. Even if the pause time is long and the velocity is moderate, a node could be "mobile" for a long time if its destination is very far from its initial location. Thus, an increased pause time tends to render the system more stationary, but in a much less direct way than \( p_{\text{stationary}} \).

As shown in Figure 9, the value of \( r_{100} \) is almost independent of the value of \( v_{\max} \): except for low velocities (\( v_{\max} \) below 0.1\( l \)), \( r_{100} \) is slightly above \( r_{\text{stationary}} \). This surprising result can be attributed to the fact that the "quantity of mobility" is only marginally influenced by the value of \( v_{\max} \), and a larger value of \( v_{\max} \) tends to decrease the "quantity of mobility." In fact, the larger \( v_{\max} \) is, the more likely it is that nodes arrive quickly at their destination and remain stationary for \( t_{\text{pause}} = 2000 \) steps.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we addressed a connectivity problem in both stationary and mobile wireless ad hoc networks. For the stationary case, we derived tight bounds on the magnitude of \( r \), \( n \), and \( l \) ensuring connectedness with high probability for 1-dimensional networks. Our bounds improve on existing results and prove a conjecture stated in a previous paper. We also investigated the mobile version of the problem for 2-dimensional networks through extensive simulation. We implemented two motion patterns to model both intentional and non-intentional movements and simulated 2-dimensional networks of different sizes and using different mobility parameters. Simulation results have shown that consistent energy savings can be achieved if connectedness must be ensured only for a large fraction of the nodes. Regarding the influence of mobility patterns, simulation results have shown that connectedness is only marginally influenced by whether motion is intentional or not, but rather related to the "quantity of mobility," informally defined as the percentage of stationary nodes with respect to the total number of nodes. For example, when about \( n/2 \) nodes are static, the network can be regarded as stationary from a connectivity point of view. Further investigation in this direction is needed and is a matter of ongoing research.

### Appendix

**Proof of Lemma 2.**

Consider the complementary event of \( E_l \), i.e., \( \bar{E}_l \), which corresponds to all the values of the random variables \( Z_1, \ldots, Z_n \) such that the 1-bits in \( B \) are consecutive. Given the hypothesis of \( E_l \), it can be easily seen that the independence of the random variables \( Z_1, \ldots, Z_n \) holds. When exactly \( k \) cells out of \( C \) are empty (i.e., \( k \) bits in \( B \) are 0), the ratio of all configurations of \( (n-k) \) consecutive 1-bits over all possible configurations of \( k \) 0-bits in \( C \) positions is given by:

\[
P(\bar{E}_l) = \frac{\binom{C}{k}}{\binom{C}{n-k}}
\]

Since \( C = l/r \) and \( r \ll l \), we have:

\[
P(\bar{E}_l) \approx \frac{\binom{l/r}{k}}{\binom{l/r}{n-k}}
\]

We can rewrite the last limit as:

\[
\lim_{l \to \infty} P(\bar{E}_l) = \lim_{l \to \infty} \frac{\binom{l/r}{k}}{\binom{l/r}{n-k}}
\]

This completes the proof.
