component  (expressed  as  a  fraction  of  n)  for 
increasing values of l in the drunkard model. 
the 
connected component (of average size about 0.9n for large 
values of l) still exists. However, if the transmitting range 
is further decreased to r0, the size of the largest connected 
component drops to about 0.5n. 
We also considered the value of the transmitting range 
ensuring  that  the  average  size  of  the  largest  connected 
component  is  0.9n,  0.75n  and  0.5n,  respectively.  The 
corresponding values of the transmitting range are denoted 
rl90, rl75 and rl50. The mobility parameters and n were set as 
above.  The  rationale  for  this  investigation  is  that  the 
network designer could be interested in maintaining only a 
certain fraction of the nodes connected, if this would result 
in significant energy savings. Further, considering that in 
many scenarios (e.g. wireless sensor networks) the cost of 
a node is very low, it could also be the case that dispersing 
twice as many nodes as needed and setting the transmitting 
ranges  in  such  a  way  that  half  of  the  nodes  remain 
connected is a feasible and cost-effective solution.  
The value of the ratio of rl90, rl75 and rl50 to rstationary for 
increasing  values  of  l  in  the  random  waypoint  model  is 
shown  in  Figure  6.  Simulation  results  have  shown  that 
while rl90/rstationary tends to decrease with increasing values 
of l, converging to about 0.52, the ratios rl75/rstationary and

rl50/rstationary  are  almost  independent  of  l.  In  particular, 
rl75/rstationary  is  about  0.46  and  rl50/rstationary  is  about  0.4. 
Further,  the  relative  differences  between  the  three  ratios 
decrease for increasing value of l. This indicates that, while 
for  small  networks  (few  nodes  distributed  in  a  relatively 
small  region)  the  energy  needed  to  maintain  90%  of  the 
nodes connected is significantly higher than that required 
to connect 50% of the nodes (rl50 is less than half of rl90 for 
l=256),  for  large  networks the savings are not as great if 
the requirement for connectivity is only 50% of the nodes 
(rl50 is 20% smaller than rl90 for l=16384). 
4.3  Simulation  results  for  different  mobility 
patterns 
A second set of simulations was done to investigate the 
effect  of  different  choices  of  the  mobility  parameters  on 
the  value  of  r100.  We  considered  the  random  waypoint 
model  with  l=4096  and  n= l =64.  The  default  values  of 
the mobility parameters were set as above, i.e. pstationary=0, 
vmin=0.1, vmax=0.01l, and tpause=2000. Then, we varied the 
value of one parameter, leaving the others unchanged. 
Figure 7 reports the value of r100 for values of pstationary 
ranging from 0 (no stationary nodes) to 1 (corresponding 
to  the  stationary  case)  in  steps  of  0.2.  Simulation  results 
show  a  sharp  drop  of  r100  in  the  interval  0.4-0.6:  for 
pstationary=0.4, r100 is about 10% larger than rstationary, while 
for pstationary=0.6 and for larger values of pstationary we have 
r100≈rstationary.  To  investigate  this  drop  more  closely,  we 
performed  further  simulations  by  exploring  the  interval 
0.4-0.6 in steps of 0.02. As shown in Figure 7, there is a 
distinct  threshold  phenomenon:  when  the  number  of 
stationary nodes is about n/2 or higher, the network can be 
regarded  as  practically  stationary  from  a  connectedness 
point of view. This result is very interesting, since it seems 
to  indicate  that  a  certain  number  (albeit  a  rather  large 
fraction)  of  stationary  nodes  would  significantly  increase 
network connectedness.  With more than n/2 mobile nodes, 
the  network  quickly  becomes  equivalent  to  one  in  which 
all nodes are mobile. 
The effect of tpause and of the velocity on r100 is shown in 
Figures 8 and 9. Increasing values of tpause tend to decrease 
the value of r100, although the trend is not as pronounced as 
in the case of pstationary. A threshold phenomenon seems to 
exist in the interval 4000-6000 in this case also. However,

further  simulations  in  this  interval  have  shown  that, 
although  the  trend  can  be  observed,  no  sharp  threshold 
actually exists. We believe that the rationale for this is the 
following: while the value of pstationary has a direct impact 
on  the  "quantity  of  mobility"  (which  can  be  informally 
understood  as  the  percentage  of  stationary  nodes  with 
respect  to  the  total  number  of  nodes),  the  effect  of  the 
pause time is not so direct. In fact, in the random waypoint 
model  the  "quantity  of  mobility"  depends  heavily  on  the 
node destinations, which are chosen uniformly at random: 
even if the pause time is long and the velocity is moderate, 
a node could be "mobile" for a long time if its destination 
is very far from its initial location. So, an increased pause 
time tends to  render the  system  more stationary, but in a 
much less direct way than pstationary.  
result  could  be  due 
As  shown  in  Figure  9,  the  value  of  r100  is  almost 
independent of the value of vmax: except for low velocities 
(vmax  below  0.1l),  r100  is  slightly  above  rstationary.  This 
surprising 
the  apparently 
counterintuitive fact that the “quantity of mobility” is only 
marginally  influenced  by  the  value  of  vmax,  and  a  larger 
value of vmax tends to decrease the “quantity of mobility”. 
In fact, the  larger  is vmax, the more likely  it is that nodes 
arrive  quickly  at  destination  and  remain  stationary  for 
tpause=2000 steps.

5.  Conclusions 
two  motion  patterns 
In this paper, we considered a connectivity problem in 
the  case  of  both  stationary  and  mobile  wireless  ad  hoc 
networks.  For  the  stationary  case,  we  have  derived  tight 
bounds  on  the  magnitude  of  r,  n  and  l  ensuring 
connectedness  with  high  probability  for  1-dimensional 
networks.  Our  bounds  improve  on  existing  results,  and 
prove a conjecture stated in a previous paper. We have also 
investigated  the  mobile  version  of  the  problem  for  2-
dimensional  networks  through  extensive  simulation.  We 
implemented 
to  model  both 
intentional  and  non-intentional  movements,  and  we 
simulated  2-dimensional  networks  of  different  sizes  and 
using  different  mobility  parameters.  Simulation  results 
have shown that consistent energy savings can be achieved 
if 
if 
connectedness must be ensured only for a large fraction of 
the  nodes.  Regarding  the  influence  of  mobility  patterns, 
simulation results  have  shown that connectedness is only 
marginally influenced by whether motion is intentional or 
not,  but  it  is  rather  related  to  the  “quantity  of  mobility”, 
which  can  be  informally  defined  as  the  percentage  of 
stationary nodes with respect to the total number of nodes. 
For example, when about n/2 nodes are static, the network 
can be regarded as stationary from a connectivity point of 
view. Further investigation in this direction is needed, and 
is a matter of ongoing research.
