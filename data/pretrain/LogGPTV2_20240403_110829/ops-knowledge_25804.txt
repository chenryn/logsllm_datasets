User: Is there a way to access a JET database from Python? I'm on Linux. All I found was a .mdb viewer in the repositories, but it's very faulty. Thanks
Assistant: Probably the most simple solution:

Download VirtualBox and install Windows and MS access in it.
Write a small Python server which use ODBC to access the database and which receives commands from a network socket.
On Linux, connect to the server in the virtual machine and access the database this way.

This gives you full access to all features. Every other solution will either limit the features you can use (for example, you won't be able to modify the data) or be pretty unsafe.
