6 Conclusion
We have presented a novel attack that takes as input a
sound recording of a dot-matrix printer processing En-
glish text, and recovers up to 72 % of printed words.
If we assume contextual knowledge about the text, the
attack achieves recognition rates up to 95 %. After an
upfront training phase, the attack is fully automated and
uses a combination of machine learning, audio process-
ing and speech recognition techniques, including spec-
trum features, Hidden Markov Models and linear clas-
siﬁcation; moreover, it allows for feedback-based incre-
mental learning. We have identiﬁed and evaluated coun-
termeasures that are suitable to prevent this kind of at-
tack. We have successfully mounted the attack in-ﬁeld in
a doctor’s practice to recover the content of medical pre-
scriptions under realistic conditions. Moreover, we have
shown the relevance of this attack by commissioning a
representative survey that showed that dot-matrix print-
ers are still deployed in a variety of sensitive areas, in
particular by banks and doctors.

tion.
A.1 The original text
First, we give the original text.
In computing, a printer is a
peripheral which produces a hard
copy (permanent human-readable
text and/or graphics) of documents
stored in electronic form, usually
on physical print media such as
paper or transparencies. Many
printers are primarily used
as local peripherals, and are
attached by a printer cable
or, in most newer printers, a
USB cable to a computer which
serves as a document source.
Some printers, commonly known
as network printers, have built-in
network interfaces (typically
wireless or Ethernet), and can
serve as a hardcopy device for any
user on the network. Individual
printers are often designed to
support both local and network
connected users at the same time.
