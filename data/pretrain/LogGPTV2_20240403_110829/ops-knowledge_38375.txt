User: Analyze possible security vulnerabilities in the following code and provide suggestions for repair public void loginUser(String username, String password) {\n String sql = \
Assistant: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + username + "' AND password='" + password + "';"; ResultSet rs = executeQuery(sql); if (rs.next()) { System.out.println ("Login successful"); } else { System.out.println("Incorrect username or password"); } } Possible security holes: 1. SQL injection attack. Since the SQL statement is directly spliced in the code, the attacker can modify the execution logic of the SQL statement by entering malicious characters, and even obtain sensitive information. 2. Clear text password transmission. The password transmitted in plain text in the code is easy to be intercepted and stolen, resulting in leakage of account information. Repair suggestions: 1. Use parameterized query or concatenate precompiled SQL statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. 2. The user password is encrypted and transmitted using secure protocols such as HTTPS to ensure the security of account information.
