User: How to implement a SMS sending system? Including SMS API access, queue processing for SMS sending, recording and query of SMS sending status, etc.
Assistant: The following steps are required to implement an SMS sending system: 1. SMS API access Choose a reliable SMS service provider, such as Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, etc., activate SMS service on their platform, and obtain an API key. Write code according to the provider's interface document, establish a connection with the API server, and realize the interface for sending SMS. 2. SMS sending queue processing Add the request to send SMS to the queue, and design a timing task or asynchronous message sending method to process the waiting SMS request in the queue regularly or asynchronously. You can use a message queue such as RabbitMQ / Kafka cluster and send messages to the queue. 3. Record and query of SMS sending status When a SMS sending request is added to the queue, record the status of the SMS in the database, and update the status of the SMS after sending. Provides a simple query interface, allowing to query information such as the status of a message and the history of sending messages. 4. Security control In the SMS sending system, it is necessary to control user rights to ensure user security, as well as audit and audit configuration of SMS content. Encryption technology should be used to ensure data security during transmission and storage. In addition, it is also necessary to fully consider the security control of the amount of SMS sent to prevent malicious behaviors such as mass SMS sales and spam SMS sending. 5. Performance optimization and expansion The SMS sending system needs to have the characteristics of high availability and high scalability. In order to ensure the robustness of the system, technologies such as caching, load balancing, and process pools can be used for performance optimization. At the same time, horizontal expansion should also be considered to increase the number of sending SMS nodes to ensure high availability of the system. To sum up, implementing a short message sending system requires technical integration, including API access, queue processing, status recording, security control, performance optimization, scalability and other considerations.
