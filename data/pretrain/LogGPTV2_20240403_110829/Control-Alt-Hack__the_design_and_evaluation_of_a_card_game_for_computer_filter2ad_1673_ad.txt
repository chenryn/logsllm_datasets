represented in the evaluation, suggests that the produced game is 
aligned with our Exposure Goal.  
6.2  Critiques and Tradeoffs 
The critiques of the game contained in educators’ responses were 
analyzed  as  falling  into  one  or  more  of  five  somewhat  self-
explanatory statements: (1) Takes a long time to learn; (2) Takes a 
long time to play; (3) Not enough fun; (4) Not enough educational 
value; and (5) Has inappropriate content. We discuss the critiques 
at  some  length  because  many  of  them  directly  reflect  the  design 
tradeoffs that we selected to meet our intended goals. 
Takes a long time to learn. Examples: 
  E5-no-play:  “Honestly,  after  reading  over  the  rules,  we 
didn’t understand how to play it, and we gave up. So sorry!” 
  E15-vetting: “The game itself is too complex to easily teach 
and use for the first time.” 
Following the shipment of the game to educators, we have created 
a new video that walks viewers through game setup and gameplay 
in  a  shorter,  clearer  format  (a  video  of  an  hour-long  conference 
talk  was  previously  available  which  contained  an  explanation  of 
how  to  play),  which  we  will  publish  online;  the  new  video  is  10 
minutes long. Some of the learning curve is due to the complexity 
of the game mechanics that we chose (Section 3.1); however, we 
accepted  a  level  of  complexity  as  a  good  tradeoff  for  increased 
replay value and the in-game opportunities to strategize. 
Takes a long time to play. Examples:

the  game  and  eliminate  some 
  E12-classroom  (22  undergraduates,  Computer  Security): 
“Students  reported  that  they  enjoyed  the  game,  but  that  the 
hour twenty was pushing the limit.” 
Gameplay  duration  can  vary  depending  upon  the  number  of 
players,  players’  familiarity  with  the  rules,  and  the  emergent 
characteristics  of  a  particular  game  instance.  Potentially  long 
gameplay can make the game unwieldy for the classroom setting; 
however,  the  gameplay  duration  can  be  an  asset  in  other  social 
settings.  Many  educators  indicated  positive  results  even  when 
playing a version of the game truncated to fit into a class period. 
Not  enough  fun.  One  example  (the  only  other  instance  an 
example of coder disagreement, and is given in the Appendix): 
  E3-vetting:  “The  feedback  from  the  instructors  trying  the 
game  is  that  it  didn’t  seem  very  enjoyable  to  play  or 
strategic.  It  may  be  that  more  experience  will  change  this, 
but the first impression was not positive.” 
While the players in the above example (adult instructors) are not 
our  primary  target  audience,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the 
instructors’  students  would  have  found  the  game  fun.  We  do  not 
have  sufficient  data  to  confidently  predict  who  will  or  will  not 
enjoy  the  game;  nevertheless,  observation  and  anecdotes  suggest 
at the very least that if the audience is familiar with and enjoys the 
style  of  game  on  which  Control-Alt-Hack  is  based,  then  it  is 
relatively likely that they will find the game fun. 
Not enough educational value. Examples: 
  E11-checkout:  “The  game  could  use  more  specificity 
around  computer  activity.  My  students  were  hoping  for  a 
higher level of rigor.” 
  E17-classroom:  “Since  we  approached  the  game  expecting 
to  be  tested  on  our  knowledge  of  vulnerabilities  and 
penetration techniques, we were dissatisfied in that manner, 
but we enjoyed the overall concept.” 
We  intentionally  chose  a  lower  level  of  technical  depth  in  the 
design  phase  in  order  to  further  the  Exposure  Goal  and  be 
comprehensible  to  a  wider  portion  of  our  target  audience;  in  the 
case  of  these  classrooms  that  decision  was  not  well  aligned  with 
instructors’ intentions. We  recognize that the  game is not a  good 
fit  for  students  with  a  more  advanced  security  background  who 
are hoping to learn new material; this would only be accomplished 
if  the  game  were  paired  with  a  supplementary  activity,  as  some 
educators chose to do (see Section A.4 in Appendix). 
Has  inappropriate  content.  There  is  only  one  instance  of  this 
critique appearing in the data: 
  E20-vetting-didn’t-read:  “I  didn’t  have  time  to  vet  the 
game  for  appropriateness  and,  from  what  I  did  read  on  the 
above site, I felt that the cards significantly contributed to a 
learning environment hostile to women.” 
We  do  not  wish  to  create  an  environment  hostile  to  women,  and 
kept  gender  issues  at  the  forefront  of  our  minds  during  game 
development. We  took  care to make references gender-neutral or 
gender-balanced:  for  example,  the  CEO  is  a  woman,  half  of  the 
Hacker cards are female, and with one exception, all innuendo is 
gender-neutral  (a  Mission  card  about  cell  phone  security  has  the 
title  “That’s  What  She  Said”).  We  recognize  that  innuendo  can 
make  an  environment  more  hostile  to  women,  particularly  if  the 
environment  already  has  uncomfortable  overtones;  however, 
during 
the 
appropriateness  of  our  content  from  multiple  parties,  including  a 
former  (female)  teacher  of  high  school  computer  science  and  3 
(female)  outreach  officers  (Section  3.2),  and  incorporated  it  into 
the  design  phase  we  gathered 
feedback  on 
922the game.  For example, we redid  the style of dress of one  of the 
female  Hackers in  response  to their comments. The materials we 
distribute to educators included a list of PG-14 cards which can be 
reviewed for content and/or removed from the deck. 
6.2.1  Discussion 
Table 3 presents the classroom-based educator experiences coded 
for the goals and critiques; Table 4 presents the same for the non-
classroom-based educator experiences.  
The most prominent critique was that the game takes a long time 
to learn (classroom:  4/14, non-classroom: 3/8). From observation 
and  anecdotes,  individuals  who  are  familiar  with  this  style  of 
game find it fairly quick to pick up. For example, E13-classroom 
gave this quote: “The students with some game experience found it 
obvious  and 
is  easy.”” 
Additionally,  we  suggest  that  educators  could  make  the  start  of 
gameplay  smoother  by  pre-designating  individuals  to  learn  the 
rules and play together ahead of time, so that those individuals can 
then seed gameplay groups during the activity. 
intuitive.  They  would  say  “this 
The  second  most  prominent  critique  was  that  the  game  did  not 
have  enough  educational  value  (classroom:  4/14,  non-classroom: 
5/8).  As  previously  mentioned,  many  of  the  non-classroom 
educators  reported  on  the  experience  wherein  they  vetted  the 
game, and chose not to use it in their classroom. Control-Alt-Hack 
may  not  be  suitable  for  all  educational  contexts,  but  its 
educational value can be increased by pairing it with or using it to 
bootstrap a level-appropriate supplementary activity, as done by 5 
of the classroom educators. 
The  third  most  common  critique—and  the  only  other  critique 
expressed by educators who used the game in the classroom—was

*Might instead use with high school students or interns.

that the game took too long to play. Control-Alt-Hack may not be 
suitable  for  all  class  formats  and  in  all  contexts;  however,  from 
observation  and  anecdotes  we  tentatively  find  that  having  more 
than  4  players  in  a  game  significantly  extends  the  duration  of 
gameplay;  we  therefore  suggest  staying  below  5  players  in  a 
game.  Responses  indicate  that  there  is  some  value  in  playing  a 
short game, even if  players do not  have time  to finish;  educators 
who  provided  as  little  as  40  minutes  of  time  to  play  (E16-
classroom) reported some positive results. Additionally, gameplay 
is  somewhat  modular,  with  logical  periodic  stopping  points;  if 
players are already familiar with gameplay, then individual rounds 
are of manageable lengths. 
6.3  “Would Use Again” 
To  serve  as  an  overall  assessment  of  the  game’s  usefulness,  we 
asked educators the following questions on the surveys: 
Would  you  use  Control-Alt-Hack  again  in  your  classroom? 
Why or why not? 
Would  you  suggest  Control-Alt-Hack  to  others?  Why  or  why 
not? 
Educators’ responses are given in Table 5. Overall, the results are 
promising.  13  of  the  14  educators  who  used  the  game  in  their 
classrooms  reported  that  they  would  suggest  the  game  to  others, 
and  10  of  them  reported  that  they  would  use  Control-Alt-Hack 
again. E8-classroom responded that they would not use the game 
with those who already had some familiarity with the subject, but 
might  with  high  school  students  or  interns,  and  E12-classroom 
clarified  that  they  would  not  use  the  game  again  in  class  due  to 
time constraints, but might as an out-of-class exercise; for both of 
these educators, this suggests that they still find merit in the game, 
even if it is not an appropriate match for their instructional needs. 
E17-classroom indicated elsewhere in responses that the game did 
not contain sufficient educational content (Table 3), so we surmise 
that  is why they will not  use the game again  or recommend  it to 
others. As mentioned in the previous section, the educational level 
of  our  game  was  an  intentional  decision  related  to  our  Primary 
Audience and Exposure Goals (Section 2).  
For  the  non-classroom  experiences  with  the  game,  5  of  the 
educators  were  playing  the  game  with  other  instructors,  friends, 
graduate students, or staff to vet its use, and did not subsequently 
report  on  using  the  game  in  their  classrooms.  The  remaining  3 
educators  would  use  the  game  again  and  would  suggest  it  to 
others  (E2-ACM,  E11-checkout,  and  E21-lunch).  E21-lunch 
clarified that they might use the game again and recommend it to 
others, but only with supplementary educational material and after 
further  consideration.  These  three  scenarios—an  extracurricular 
club,  a  checkout,  and  a  staff  lunch—are  highly  aligned  with  the 
social, ad hoc interaction model supported by choosing to create a 
recreational game.  
6.4  Reaching New Audiences 
Interestingly, 2 of the 14 educators who used Control-Alt-Hack in 
their  classrooms  reported  that  they  would  not  have  covered 
similar  security  material  in  any  other  format.  An  additional 
educator gave this response, but was teaching a computer security 
course  (E12-classroom),  so  this  response  may  have  been  in  error 
or  a  misinterpretation  of  our  intention  when  posing  the  question 
(If  you  had  not  used  Control-Alt-Hack,  would  you  still  have 
covered  the  material?);  it  is  also  possible  that  the  educator 
intended  to  convey  that  they  would  not  have  covered  topics 
included  in  the  game  such  as  physical  security  or  cyber-physical 
security. We are conservative and count this response as an error. 
If the educators in the remaining contexts would not have covered
