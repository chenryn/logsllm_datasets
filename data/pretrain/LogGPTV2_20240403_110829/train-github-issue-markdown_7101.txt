Atom version: 0.123.0  
Platform: OSX v10.9.4
### Reproduce:
  1. Open new atom window with single pane, "pane1"
  2. Open new pane, "pane2" (`cmd`+`k`+`arrow`)
  3. Ensure pane2 is empty
  4. Focus on pane1 & open Settings (`cmd`+`,`)
  5. Drag Settings tab to empty pane2
As per screencap above, this bug only presents when the target pane is empty.
Dragging to a pane which has an editor window open renders the Settings page
normally.
