**Confidence Goods and Travel Products**

Travel products, often categorized as "confidence goods," cannot generally be tested before purchase. To some extent, travel products can also be considered "experience goods" (e.g., car rental and hotel stays). Traditionally, travel agents have been expected to visit various locations to provide detailed and accurate recommendations to customers. 

**Online Booking Services and Cost Reductions**

One of the primary benefits of online booking services is significant cost reduction, primarily due to decreased transaction costs and the unlimited temporal and geographic availability of the system. Dynamic packaging, which involves the individualization and customization of travel packages, further enhances this cost efficiency through fully automated processes.

**Communication and Information Dissemination**

While using the Internet for customer communication may reduce social interaction to the exchange of digital data, it also offers new opportunities to inform customers about tourism products in a cost-effective manner. This can include providing information in various digital formats, such as textual descriptions, photographs, and videos. Additionally, Internet technology can make the search and booking process more transparent and facilitate the creation of a community of travelers.

**Framework of Critical Success Factors and Requirements**

After introducing the basic strategies for dynamic packaging, we will develop a framework of critical success factors for each strategy. This framework will allow for the evaluation of existing systems, and we will derive operational criteria for assessment.

### Geographic Market Expansion

When expanding into international markets, it is essential to consider target group-specific requirements, such as language, cultural issues, and legal aspects. Supporting multilingual communication is crucial, as the ability to communicate effectively is fundamental for interacting with customers in new markets. Data on personal preferences and previous travel experiences can be gathered through online questionnaires or automated click-stream analysis. It is important to ensure that the data collected is up-to-date and that privacy concerns are addressed.

### Customization

Customized products and processes are a core objective of dynamic packaging. To successfully implement a customization strategy, it is necessary to cooperate with a critical mass of suppliers from various travel industries, such as airlines, hotels, and car rentals. Integration of data formats and information systems of suppliers is essential to provide real-time, up-to-date information. Customization should allow for flexibility and personalization, including preselecting preferences and customizing the order of searching for offers.

### Added Value

Travel products, being mostly confidence goods, require appropriate ways of informing customers about product characteristics. Using multimedia, such as textual descriptions, photographs, and videos, can enhance the description of travel products. Establishing a community of travelers for sharing travel experiences can also add value. The community should be designed to allow users to individualize their view based on personal preferences.

### Cost Leadership

The travel industry is characterized by a high degree of internationality and a dynamic market. Dynamic packaging aims to achieve better and faster responses to market changes. However, to cost-effectively implement dynamic packaging, it is necessary to support an appropriate level of integration with the information systems of value chain partners.

### System Integration

Integration can be achieved on two levels: data and functionality. On the data level, a semantic framework can explicate the meaning and relationships between concepts. On the functional level, standardized communication protocols and functions for retrieving or calculating information can support efficient and secure data transactions. Standardized data formats and semantics offer more opportunities for cost-effective reuse of information and reduce switching costs when changing suppliers.

### Analysis of Online Travel Agencies

Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz are the three most dominant online travel agencies leading the development of dynamic packaging technology. Expedia, the largest online travel agency, follows a merchant model and offers comprehensive dynamic packaging features. Travelocity and Orbitz also provide dynamic packaging, but under different names and with varying functionalities. All three agencies offer multilingual support and provide information on hotels through internal star ratings and customer reviews.

In summary, the developed framework of critical success factors and operational criteria allows for the evaluation of dynamic packaging implementations. The analysis of the three major online travel agencies provides insights into the maturity and potential of current dynamic packaging strategies.
