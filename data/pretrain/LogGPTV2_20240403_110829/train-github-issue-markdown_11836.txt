### Issue Report

#### I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
When form validation fails, the `TextField` should be marked as an error state to indicate that there is an issue with the input.

## Current Behavior
Currently, when the form is in an error state, no visual indication is provided. The `TextField` does not change its appearance or provide any feedback to the user.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Visit the following CodeSandbox: [Link](https://codesandbox.io/s/qk17pp2vlq)
2. Enter invalid data into the `TextField`.
3. Observe that the `TextField` does not visually indicate an error state.

## Context
I am looking for the simplest and most effective approach to implement form validation in my project. I would appreciate any feedback on the current method I am using. I have searched through the existing issues but did not find any relevant information. If this is off-topic, please guide me in the right direction.

Thank you!
