User: I want to install python using homebrew and I noticed there are 2 different formulas for it, one for python 2.x and another for 3.x. The first symlinks "python" and the other uses "python3". so I ran brew install python3. 
I really only care about using python 3 so I would like the default command to be "python" instead of having to type "python3" every time. Is there a way to do this?  I tried brew switch python 3.3 but I get a "python is not found in the Cellar" error.
Assistant: You definitely do not want to do this! You may only care about Python 3, but many people write code that expects python to symlink to Python 2. Changing this can seriously mess your system up.
