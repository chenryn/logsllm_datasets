**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Program Upload

Adversaries may attempt to upload a program from a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to gather information about an industrial process. By uploading the program, they can acquire and analyze the underlying logic, which can provide valuable insights into the operational details of the system.

Programs can be uploaded using vendor-provided software, which allows users to access and read the code running on the PLC. This software can be utilized to transfer the target program to a workstation, jump box, or another interfacing device for further analysis.
