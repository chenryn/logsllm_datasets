User: On Mac OSX 10.6.4 where do you install dynamic libraries (dylib) so Python 2.6.1 can import them? I've tried placing them in /usr/local/lib and usr/localbin and /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages but none of these locations have worked. The library I'm trying to install is libevecache.dylib a library to access cache files for Eve-Online.
Assistant: Run the included setup.py file. You should never try to copy things into place manually; it'll lead to disaster, especially in situations involving pip or easy_install.
