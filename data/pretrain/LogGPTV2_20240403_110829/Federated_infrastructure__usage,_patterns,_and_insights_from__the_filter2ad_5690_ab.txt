### 1. Introduction and Context

During the period under study (through May 2021), validators were not yet active, so we do not consider them extensively in this analysis. However, it is important to note that validators appear as special-case miners on the blockchain and will influence our later analysis of deployed hotspots. Our primary focus in this study is on Helium as a wireless network, rather than the maintenance and operation of the Helium blockchain.

We introduce the term "handlers" to describe individuals who own and maintain Helium hotspots. Unlike users, who send and receive data using the network, handlers and their hotspots do not generate any data; they simply forward it and receive payment. It is possible for individual entities, such as the authors of this paper, to act as both users of the network and handlers who help deploy the network (e.g., we own two hotspots and around a dozen devices).

### 2. Proof of Coverage (PoC)

To function effectively as a wireless carrier, Helium must provide geographically wide-area coverage. As a decentralized wireless network not owned and guaranteed by any single entity, there needs to be a mechanism to prove that a hotspot is providing coverage. Helium uses an algorithm called Proof of Coverage (PoC) to verify the location of a hotspot.

At random intervals, one hotspot acts as a challenger and selects another hotspot, referred to as the challengee or transmitter, to send a wireless packet with an encrypted secret. Any hotspot within wireless range can witness this packet by reporting its contents to the challenger. Hotspot challenges are not geographically coordinated and can involve any other hotspot in the world. They do not target and prove coverage in specific regions but instead stochastically validate every node in the network over time.

After a PoC event, the challenger, challengee, and witnesses receive HNT rewards. Challenger rewards are fixed, while challengees' and witnesses' rewards scale with the quality of coverage (more witnesses generally mean better coverage). There have been and continue to be numerous attempts to cheat this metric, and the system is continually evolving.

When deployments are sparse, and a hotspot cannot "see" any other hotspots, it can only earn PoC rewards for challenge construction. This incentivizes hotspot density to avoid gaps in coverage. However, there is also a decay in rewards if hotspots are too dense. Qualitatively, this seems to work, as improving coverage rewards is often discussed on Helium forums and message boards. We discuss these incentives and coverage quantitatively in Sections 7 and 8.

### 3. HNT and Data Credits (DC)

For general-purpose users of the network, Helium aims to provide a stable pricing model. Miners are rewarded with newly minted Helium tokens (HNT), a traditional cryptocurrency whose value ranged from $8.32 to $19.70 USD in May 2021. Users planning deployments require more stable pricing, as transit costs cannot unexpectedly double overnight. For this, Helium introduces Data Credits (DC), whose value is fixed at $0.00001 USD per 1 DC. All payments are made using fixed-cost DC.

Together, DC and HNT create a "burn-and-mint equilibrium." In the long run, the intent is to stabilize the price of HNT and tether it to network usage. In the short term, DC provides a stable, deterministic payment model for network users, while network operators receive incentives in the more speculative form of HNT. Notably, this model enables the Helium network to "pay" handlers without incurring traditional capital outlay. The details of this new crypto-economic model are provided for background, but the analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. We focus on the network infrastructure-related aspects of Helium.

### 4. Data Sources and Methodology

The Helium network is a dynamically growing network composed of handlers who deploy hotspots, many users who deploy edge devices, and a modest number of advanced users who deploy their own routers (cloud endpoints). While the distributed nature makes direct inspection of network activity challenging, the pay-per-access design means that most transactions are recorded in a publicly accessible ledger: the Helium blockchain.

Most of our analysis stems from an examination of the history of all transactions on the blockchain. While anyone can download and parse the blockchain—easiest done by running the miner Docker container locally—most of our analysis takes advantage of a replica of the blockchain continuously extracted, transformed, and loaded into a database by the Decentralized Wireless Alliance (DeWi). This database also monitors the Helium p2p network, which we use for our analyses. Details on the DeWi database are available on their Discord. We spot-verified several of our own transactions and our hotspots' p2p records to ensure they appear correctly in this database. We also perform some controlled measurements in Section 8 to measure the actual performance of the network.

The Helium blockchain is a fast-moving target. New blocks are minted every 60 seconds, and as of this writing, roughly 1,000 new hotspots are being added daily. Unless otherwise noted, measurements in this paper reflect the state of the network as of late May 2021.

There are 20 native Helium blockchain transactions. The transactions most relevant to our analysis are as follows:
- `add_gateway` adds a new hotspot to the network, including the hotspot ID, owner ID, location, and time.
- `assert_location` allows an established hotspot to change its location. To discourage frequent moving, this transaction carries a 1,000,000 DC fee ($10 USD).
- `PoC_request/PoC_receipt` is created for each PoC challenge and indicates the work done to validate network coverage.
- `state_channel_open` creates a sidechain for a router to use to receive packets, staking DC in advance.
- `state_channel_close` settles payments, burns spent DC, and returns unspent DC to the router.

To start, we can look at this blockchain data as a whole for initial insights and investigatory guidance. The first real entry to the blockchain was recorded on July 29, 2019. The vast majority of transactions recorded on the blockchain consist of PoC requests and receipts. Out of 59,092,640 total transactions, 58,619,153 are carried out only to provide proof for the network's accuracy and validity. Since the inception of the Helium network, approximately 99.2% of all blockchain transactions are PoC transactions.

### 5. What Does "Decentralized Wireless" Look Like in Practice?

We begin our analysis by examining hotspots, which make up the majority of the deployed infrastructure of Helium. We are interested in understanding where hotspots are deployed, who is deploying them, and what happens to deployed hotspots over time.

#### 5.1 Where Are Hotspots?

Whenever a hotspot's location is first published to the Helium network or changed, Helium records a transaction that contains the hotspot location encoded via the H3 geospatial indexing system. The H3 encoding system encodes locations to hexagonal areas on a map. If a hotspot lies within the borders of the hexagon, the hotspot's latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates are mapped to that specific H3 identity. H3 hexes allow for different "resolutions," which encode location with varying precision. Hotspot locations are stored at resolution 12, which are hexagons with an average edge length of 9.4 meters and an average area of 3.1 square meters. For our location analysis, we assume all hotspots are located at the center of their hex. We decode the H3 location to retrieve hotspot latitude and longitude, which we use in all subsequent analyses.

Observing how hotspot locations change gives insight into whether the policy and rewards set out by the Helium network improve real-world coverage. In Figure 2, we look at the absolute number of moves per hotspot and find that the vast majority of hotspots either do not move at all or move no more than two times. The Helium network permits hotspots to move up to two times for "free" (the Helium company pays the `assert_location` fee). One explanation for the large number of "first-move" events may be new hotspot owners first testing the hotspot in an easily accessible location and then moving the hotspot to a permanent deployment location.

To test this hypothesis, we study all hotspot moves. In Figure 3, we see two broad categories of moves. The first are a large number of short-distance moves, likely indicative of a local test-then-deploy scenario. The second are a large number of long-distance moves. We visualize these longer moves in Figure 3c.

We see two classes of long-distance movement. The first are hotspots that assert their location with a default (0,0) latitude and longitude—the large cluster in the ocean just below West Africa—and then later move to their true location. Hotspots occasionally move to (0,0) but do not stay there; currently, aside from hotspots who initialized at (0,0), there are no online hotspots that have moved to and remain at (0,0). We found that 331 (89%) of (0,0) location assertions were first-time assertions, suggesting that most initial assertions at (0,0) were accidental (e.g., no GPS fix); the total number of assertions at (0,0) is 372. The remaining 41 assertions at (0,0) were attempted relocations. This could have been accidental, a test out of curiosity, people attempting to game the system by clustering hotspots at a fake location, or possibly Helium developers testing validator nodes (which appear in the blockchain as hotspots that never transmit packets).

The second trend is a non-trivial "flow" of hotspots from the US to international destinations, particularly Europe. We attribute these moves to the resale of hotspots and the heavy US-export to Helium's initial sales restriction to only the US market.

We also studied the typical timing interval between a hotspot's relocation. We plotted a CDF regarding the number of blocks between a hotspot's relocation in Figure 4 to observe the time interval between location assertions; one block approximately corresponds to one minute. 17.9% of hotspot relocations occur within a day, 35.8% of relocations occur within a week, and 63.2% of relocations occur within a month. The remaining 36.8% of hotspot relocations have a timing interval of more than a month.

Finally, in the analysis of hotspot moves, we identify a small number of outliers. For example, one hotspot moved twenty times. It is possible this is an individual with multiple residences bringing their hotspot along with them, perhaps in service of providing local coverage for their own edge devices. However, we also note that the owner of this hotspot has well over 800,000 HNT, possibly posing as a business entity or developer account.

#### 5.2 How Fast Is Helium Growing?

Figure 5 shows the cumulative and daily number of hotspots that were added to the Helium network. For coverage discussions, we refine this count and draw a distinction between "connected" and "online" hotspots. A connected hotspot is one that has ever connected to the Helium network (this is the number displayed on various Helium status pages), while an online hotspot is one that is still connected and active (defined as fully synced and participating in PoC challenges). On March 7th, 2021, the total number of connected hotspots was about 20,000, but only approximately 16,000 hotspots were online. On May 26th, 2021, the total number of connected hotspots was about 40,000, with approximately 35,000 hotspots online.

Qualitatively, growth seems mostly limited by hotspot availability. New production runs (‘batches’) are quickly placed into service.

### 6. Bulk Owners

#### 6.1 Commercial Entities

We start by identifying large owners on the Helium blockchain and describe how we work backwards to identify the owning company. We show how this procedure may be used to identify entities using Helium infrastructure solely with information available on the public blockchain or other easily accessible public sources. A similar approach can identify unannounced users of the network. We wish to emphasize that Helium does not explicitly provide receiver or transmitter anonymity. However, the design of the network also does not explicitly identify the users performing transactions. We show how easily publicly announced application traffic can be identified in the blockchain, which may be problematic for applications intended to be private.

**Example 1: Careband**
Careband is a small startup in Chicago that specializes in developing wander-management wearables to detect patient movement, especially for those with dementia. Their main office is located at 222 West Merchandise Mart Plaza. We looked at hotspots within that area and found one owner ID that owns 25 hotspots, mostly in and around Chicago city and some individual hotspots in the rest of the United States. We believe these hotspots are owned by Careband or provide coverage to Careband customers.

**Example 2: Nowi**
Nowi is another startup that uses the Helium network to support water monitoring systems for multi-family property owners. They have one testimonial from Edworks LLC Property Management. We found out they are registered in Stonington, Connecticut. As of September 17, 2021, there are 19 owners that collectively own 61 hotspots in Stonington. Out of them, 9 owners in Stonington own multiple hotspots and regularly send at least tens of data packets every couple of hours. This indicates that there are devices communicating their data over the Helium network.

#### 6.2 Mining Pools

We believe that owners who own multiple hotspots and carry out frequent data transactions are service providers who manage these hotspots to provide coverage to their products. Other owners, such as the one in Figure 6, own multiple hotspots that are geographically distributed but do not engage in data transactions. We believe these owners are running hotspots to earn coverage rewards.

Ownership clusters in cities are popular. In one case, two owners own 144 hotspots and 136 hotspots in the Denver, Colorado area. The hotspots appear to be distributed evenly around the city. Deploying hotspots too geospatially close to each other reduces reward benefits; hotspots yield better mining efficiency when placed reasonably far away from each other. This incentive of improved rewards from improved network coverage appears to be important to these types of owners.

The examples we present here have publicly announced their use of Helium via the Helium blog, which we believe mitigates any potential harm from using them.
