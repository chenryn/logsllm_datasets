validators were not yet live during the period under study (through
May 2021), we do not consider them extensively. We note validators
here as they appear as special-case miners on the blockchain and
will influence some of our analysis of deployed hotspots later. Our
focus in this study is primarily Helium as a wireless network, as op-
posed to the maintenance and operation of the Helium blockchain.
Handlers is a new term we define to describe individuals who
own and maintain Helium hotspots. In contrast to users, who send
and receive data using the network, handlers and their hotspots do
not generate any data; they simply forward it and receive payment.
It is possible for individual entities (e.g. the authors of this paper) to
act as both users of the network and handlers who help deploy the
network (i.e., we own two hotspots and around a dozen devices).
2.3 Proof of Coverage
To be useful as a wireless carrier, Helium needs to provide geograph-
ically wide-area coverage. As a decentralized wireless network not
owned and guaranteed by any one entity, there needs to be a mech-
anism for the network to prove that a hotspot is providing coverage.
Helium uses an algorithm called Proof of Coverage (PoC) to prove
the location of a hotspot. At random, one hotspot will act as a
challenger and will randomly select another hotspot, referred to
as either the challengee or transmitter, to send a wireless packet
with an encrypted secret. Any hotspot that is in wireless range
can witness this packet by reporting its contents to the challenger.
Hotspot challenges are not geographically coordinated and can be
acted on any other hotspot in the world. They do not target and
prove any specific region has coverage, rather they stochastically
validate every node in the network’s coverage over time.
Each of the challenger, challengee, and witnesses receive HNT re-
wards after the PoC event. Challenger rewards are fixed (the reward
is in creating and administering the challenge), but challengees’
and witnesses’ rewards scale with the quality of coverage (in simple
terms here, more witnesses are better). As we will show, there have
been and still are numerous attempts to cheat this metric, and it
continues to evolve.

When deployments are sparse, i.e., if a hotspot cannot “see” any
other hotspots, then hotspots can only earn PoC rewards for chal-
lenge construction. This aims to incentivize hotspot density such
that there are not holes or gaps in coverage; however, there also is
decaying of rewards if hotspots are too dense. Qualitatively, this
seems to work, as improving coverage rewards is often discussed
on Helium forums and message boards. We discuss these incentives
and coverage quantitatively in Sections 7 and 8.
2.4 HNT and DC
For general purpose users of the network, Helium aims to provide
a stable pricing model. Miners are rewarded with newly minted
Helium tokens (HNT). HNT is a traditional cryptocurrency, whose
value has ranged from $8.32–19.70 USD in the month of May, 2021.
Users planning deployments require more stable pricing—transit
costs cannot unexpectedly double overnight. For this, Helium in-
troduces Data Credits (DC), whose value is fixed at $0.00001 USD
per 1 DC. All payments are done using fixed-cost DC.
Together, DC and HNT create a “burn-and-mint equilibrium.”
In the long run, the intent is to stabilize the price of HNT and
tether it to network usage. In the short term, DC provide a stable,
deterministic payment model for network users, while network
operators receive incentives in the more speculative form of HNT.
Notably, this model enables the Helium network to “pay” handlers
without incurring traditional capital outlay. The details of this new
crypto-economic model are only provided for background, analy-
sis is beyond the scope of this paper; we only study the network
infrastructure-related aspects of Helium.
3 DATA SOURCES & METHODOLOGY
The Helium network is a dynamically growing network composed
of handlers that deploy hotspots, (ideally) many users that deploy
edge devices, and a modest number of advanced users that de-
ploy their own routers (cloud endpoints). While the distributed
nature makes direct inspection of network activity challenging, the
pay-per-access design means that most transactions are ultimately
recorded in a publicly accessible ledger: the Helium blockchain.
Most of our analysis stems from an examination of the history of
all transactions on the blockchain. While anyone can download and
parse the blockchain—easiest done by running the miner Docker
container locally—most of our analysis takes advantage of a replica
of the blockchain continuously extracted, transformed, and loaded
into a database by the Decentralized Wireless Alliance (DeWi). This
database also monitors the Helium p2p network, which we also
use for our analyses. Details on the DeWi database are available on
their Discord.5 We spot-verified several of our own transactions
and our hotspots’ p2p records to ensure they appear correctly in
this database. We also perform some controlled measurements in
Section 8 to measure the actual performance of the network.
The Helium blockchain is a fast-moving target. New blocks are
minted every 60 s, and as of this writing, roughly 1,000 new hotspots
are being added daily. Unless otherwise noted, measurements in
this paper reflect the state of the network as of late May, 2021.
There are 20 native Helium blockchain transactions [8]. The
transactions most relevant to our analysis are as follows:
5discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/769659586205712424/786375046930104341
add_gateway adds a new hotspot to the network. It includes
the hotspot ID, owner ID, location, and time when it was added.
assert_location allows an established hotspot to change its lo-
cation. To discourage frequent moving of hotspots, this transaction
carries a 1,000,000 DC fee ($10 USD).
PoC_request/PoC_receipt is created every PoC challenge and
indicates the work done to validate network coverage.
state_channel_open creates a sidechain6 for a router to use to
receive packets. This stakes DC in advance, which allows packet
delivery without waiting for individual payment transactions.
state_channel_close settles payments. Spent DC are burned,
miners that ferried data receive HNT proportional to total network
traffic, and unspent DC are returned to the router.
To start, we can look at this blockchain data as a whole for initial
insights and investigatory guidance. We see the first real entry to
the blockchain was recorded on July 29, 2019. The vast majority of
transactions recorded on the blockchain consist of PoC requests
and receipts. Out of 59,092,640 total transactions, 58,619,153 are
carried out only to provide proof for the network accuracy and
validity. Since the inception of the Helium network, approximately
99.2% of all blockchain transactions are PoC transactions.
4 WHAT DOES “DECENTRALIZED
WIRELESS” LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE?
We begin our analysis by looking at hotspots, which make up the
majority of the deployed infrastructure of Helium. We are interested
in understanding where hotspots are deployed, who is deploying
them, and what happens to deployed hotspots over time.
4.1 Where are Hotspots?
Whenever a hotspot’s location is first published to the Helium
network or changed, Helium records a transaction that contains the
hotspot location encoded via the H3 geospatial indexing system [19].
The H3 encoding system encodes locations to hexagonal areas on a
map; if a hotspot lies within borders of the hexagon, the hotspot’s
latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates are mapped to that specific
H3 identity. H3 hexes allow for different “resolutions,” which encode
location with varying precision. Hotspot locations are stored at
resolution 12, which are hexagons with an average edge length
of 9.4 m and average area of 3.1 m2; for our location analysis, we
assume all hotspots are located at the center of their hex.7 We
decode the H3 location to retrieve hotspot latitude and longitude,
which we use in all subsequent analyses.
Observing how hotspot locations change gives insight into whether
the policy and rewards set out by the Helium network improve
real-world coverage. In Figure 2, we look at the absolute number of
moves per hotspot and find that the vast majority of hotspots either
do not move at all or move no more than two times. The Helium
6See Singh et al. for background and detailed discussion of sidechains [17]
7One may note from these averages that H3 hexes are not regular hexagons. This is a
result of H3’s use of gnomonic projection. For resolution 12 hexes, the min and max
area are 1.9 m2 and 3.7 m2 respectively. In practice, hotspot locations are set using
manually entered GPS fixes from a “set pin” interface on a companion phone app.
Resolution 12 hexes are likely more precise than these fixes for the majority of use
cases. As our analyses are primarily concerned with distances of several hundred
meters or more, a few meters imprecision in hotspot location is not significant.

Blocks are minted roughly once a minute.

scenario. The second are a large number of long-distance moves.
We visualize these longer moves in Figure 3c.
We see two classes of long-distance movement. The first are
hotspots that assert their location with a default (0,0) latitude and
longitude—the large cluster in the ocean just below West Africa—
and then later move to their true location. Hotspots occasionally
move to (0,0) but do not stay there; currently, aside from hotspots
who initialized at (0,0), there are no online hotspots that have moved
to and remain at (0,0). We found that 331 (89%) of (0,0) location
assertions were first time assertions, which suggests that most
of the initial assertions at (0,0) were accidental (e.g. no GPS fix);
the total number of assertions at (0,0) is 372. The remaining 41
assertions at (0,0) were attempted relocations. This could have also
been accidental, a test out of curiosity, people attempting to game
the system by clustering hotspots at a fake location, or possibly
Helium developers testing validator nodes (which appear in the
blockchain as hotspots that never transmit packets).
The second trend is a non-trivial “flow” of hotspots from the
US to international destinations, particularly Europe. We attribute
these moves to resale of hotspots, and the heavy US-export to
Helium’s initial sales restriction to only the US market.
(c) Hotspots move from blue circles to red "X" marks.
Figure 3: CDF of all moves and map of hotspot location
changes greater than 500 km. Figure 3c shows every location
change from initial to final destination distances that are greater
than 500 km away. Blue dotted lines indicate moves that departed
the US; red dotted lines indicate location initialization outside of
the US. Black dotted lines indicate moves from the initial location
at (0,0) to anywhere else in the world, and black solid lines indicate
a hotspot whose location changed to (0,0).
network permits hotspots to move up to two times for “free” (the
Helium company pays the assert_location fee). One explanation
for the large number of “first-move” events may be new hotspot
owners first testing the hotspot in an easily accessible location and
then moving the hotspot to a permanent deployment location.
To test this hypothesis, we study all hotspot moves. In Figure 3,
we see two broad categories of moves. The first are a large number
of short-distance moves, likely indicative of a local test-then-deploy
We also studied the typical timing interval between a hotspot’s
relocation. We plotted a CDF regarding the number of blocks be-
tween a hotspot’s relocation in Figure 4 to observe the time interval
between location assertions; one block approximately corresponds
to one minute. 17.9% of hotspot relocations occur within a day,
35.8% of relocations occur within a week, and 63.2% of relocations
occur within a month. The remaining 36.8% of hotspot relocations
have a timing interval of more than a month.
Finally, in the analysis of hotspot moves, we identify a small
number of outliers. For example, one hotspot moved twenty times.
It is possible this is an individual with multiple residences bringing
their hotspot along with them, perhaps in service of providing local
coverage for their own edge devices. However, we also note that the
owner of this hotspot has well over 800,000 HNT, possibly posing
as a business entity or developer account.
4.2 How Fast is Helium Growing?
Figure 5 shows the cumulative and daily number of hotspots that
were added to the Helium network. For coverage discussions, we
refine this count and draw a distinction between “connected” and
“online” hotspots. A connected hotspot is one that has ever con-
nected to the Helium network (this is the number displayed on

Figure 6: Hotspot distribution of one larger owner.
4.3.1 Bulk Owners – Commercial. We start from large owners on
the Helium blockchain and describe how we work backwards to
identify the owning company. We show how this procedure may
be used to identify entities using Helium infrastructure solely with
information available on the public blockchain or other easily-
accessible public sources.8 A similar approach can identify unan-
nounced users of the network. We wish to emphasize that Helium
does not explicitly provide receiver or transmitter anonymity. How-
ever, the design of the network also does not explicitly identify the
users that are performing transactions. We show how easily publicly
announced application traffic can be identified in the blockchain.
This may be problematic for applications intended to be private.
Careband is a small startup in Chicago which specializes in
developing wander-management wearables to detect patient move-
ment, especially for those who have dementia. Their main office is
located in 222 West Merchandise Mart Plaza. We looked at hotspots
within that area and found one owner ID which owns 25 hotspots
mostly in and around in Chicago city and some individual hotspots
in rest of the United States. We believe these hotspots are owned
by Careband or provide coverage to Careband customers.
nowi is another startup that uses the Helium network to support
water monitoring systems for multi-family property owners. They
have one testimonial from Edworks LLC Property management.
We found out they are registered in Stonington, Connecticut. There
are 19 owners that collectively own 61 hotspots in Stonington
as of September 17, 2021. Out of them, 9 owners in Stonington
own multiple hotspots and regularly sends at least tens of data
packets every couple of of hours. This indicates that there are
devices communicating their data over the Helium network.
4.3.2 Bulk Owners – Mining Pools. We believe that owners which
own multiple hotspots and carry out frequent data transactions are
service providers who manage these hotspots to provide coverage
to their products. Other owners, such as the one in Figure 6, own
multiple hotspots which were geographically distributed but do not
engage in data transactions. We believe these owners are running
hotspots to earn coverage rewards.
Ownership clusters in cities are popular. In one case, two own-
ers own 144 hotspots and 136 hotspots in the Denver, Colorado
area. The hotspots appear to be distributed evenly around the city.
Deploying hotspots too geospatially close to each other reduces re-
ward benefits; hotspots yield better mining efficiency when placed
reasonably far away from each other. This incentive of improved
rewards from improved network coverage appears to be important
to these types of owners.
8The examples we present here have publicly announced their use of Helium via the
Helium blog [9, 10], which we believe mitigates any potential harm from using them.
