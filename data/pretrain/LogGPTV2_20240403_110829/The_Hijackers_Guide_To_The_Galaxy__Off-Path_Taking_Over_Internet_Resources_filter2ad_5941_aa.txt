## Abstract

Internet resources form the backbone of the digital society, providing essential platforms for critical infrastructures, financial services, and government operations. Control over these resources effectively translates into control over the digital society.

In this work, we demonstrate that current practices in managing Internet resources, including IP addresses, domains, certificates, and virtual platforms, are insecure. Adversaries can maintain control over these resources, performing stealthy manipulations leading to devastating attacks. We show that network adversaries can take over at least 68% of assigned IPv4 address space and 31% of top Alexa domains by hijacking accounts associated with these resources.

We achieve account hijacking through off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks, redirecting password recovery links to adversarial hosts. Our findings indicate that all tested providers are vulnerable to these attacks. We recommend mitigations to block the attacks, but fundamental changes in the management of Internet resources are necessary to prevent such transactions from being easily and stealthily executed.

## 1. Introduction

Internet resources are the foundation of modern societies, supporting a wide range of digital services, from critical infrastructures to medical and childcare services. The stability and availability of these services depend on the control over Internet resources, making them attractive targets for adversaries.

In this study, we explore the security of Internet resource management systems, including IP address management (Regional Internet Registries, RIRs), domain registration (domain registrars), virtual machine resources (IaaS providers), and certification (Certificate Authorities, CAs). These providers manage the allocation, registration, and operation of Internet resources for their customers. We investigate how easy it is for network adversaries to take over customer accounts and exploit the associated resources.

We find that current practices are insecure, allowing adversaries to take control of digital assets and maintain control for extended periods without detection. Although such attacks are appealing to strong nation-state adversaries and security agencies, we demonstrate that even weak off-path network adversaries can perform these attacks through protocol manipulations.

## 2. DNS Cache Poisoning Overview

### DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] performs lookups for services on the Internet. Recursive caching DNS resolvers receive requests for services in different domains and query authoritative nameservers. The nameservers respond with DNS records, which are cached by the resolvers and provided to clients and servers. Subsequent requests for the same domain are answered from the cache.

### DNS Cache Poisoning
In a DNS cache poisoning attack, an adversary redirects clients of a resolver to an adversarial IP address for queries in a target domain. The adversary sends a spoofed DNS response with malicious records mapping the victim domain to an adversarial IP address. If the resolver accepts and caches the malicious record, its cache becomes poisoned.

### History of DNS Cache Poisoning
Cache poisoning attacks have evolved over time, with various mitigations and countermeasures. In 1995, Vixie suggested randomizing UDP source ports in DNS requests [45]. In 2002, Bernstein warned about the vulnerability of relying solely on Transaction ID (TXID) randomization [7]. In 2007, vulnerabilities in Bind9 and Windows DNS resolvers were identified, allowing off-path attackers to reduce TXID entropy [29, 30]. In 2008, Kaminsky presented a practical cache poisoning attack against truly randomized TXID [26], leading to patches that randomize UDP source ports in queries [RFC5452].

However, new methods have been developed to bypass these mitigations, including side-channel attacks [17, 41, 47, 5, 33, 31], fragmentation-based attacks [18, 11, 23, 32], and others. DNSSEC [RFC6840, 46] can prevent cache poisoning, but its deployment is limited, with less than 1% of second-level domains signed and most resolvers not validating signatures [12].

## 3. Attack Overview

Our study examines the security of services that provide access and management of key digital assets, including domains, IP prefixes, ASes, virtual machines, and certificates. Table 1 lists the resources and public service providers studied. Access and management of these resources are performed through accounts offered by providers via web portals.

### Attack Steps
1. **Find the Target**: Identify an account to which the resources are assigned.
2. **Poison DNS of Public Service Provider**: Launch an off-path DNS cache poisoning attack against the provider's DNS resolver.
3. **Hijack Victim Account**: Trigger password recovery, causing the reset link to be sent to the adversarial host.
4. **Manipulate the Resources**: Exploit the resources associated with the hijacked account.

## 4. Off-Path DNS Cache Poisoning

Our key contribution is demonstrating that once an adversary controls an account with a resource provider, they can easily and stealthily manipulate the associated digital resources. We use methodologies from [14] to launch off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks, including BGP prefix hijacks, side-channels, and IPv4 defragmentation cache poisoning. We evaluate these attacks against providers and customers in our dataset.

### 4.1 Setup
To test our attacks, we set up a victim AS by registering a secondary LIR account with RIPE NCC for our organization. This setup allowed us to conduct experiments in the Internet.

## 5. Evaluation and Findings

### 5.1 Methodologies
We use the following methodologies to launch off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks:
- **BGP Prefix Hijacks**: Advertise a BGP announcement to hijack the prefix of a victim for a short time.
- **Side-Channels**: Use side-channels to infer the source ports in DNS requests.
- **IPv4 Defragmentation Cache Poisoning**: Exploit vulnerabilities in IPv4 fragmentation to inject malicious DNS records.

### 5.2 Experimental Setup
We describe the experimental setup used to evaluate the attacks against the providers and customers in our dataset. This includes setting up a victim AS and conducting controlled experiments to measure the success rate and stealthiness of the attacks.

### 5.3 Results
Our results show that all tested providers are vulnerable to the off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks. We detail the specific vulnerabilities and the extent to which the attacks can be carried out undetected.

## 6. Manipulation of Digital Resources

Once an account is hijacked, the adversary can manipulate the associated digital resources. For example, hijacking an SSO account allows the adversary to take over ASes and IP blocks allocated to the victim. They can also make manipulations in the Internet Routing Registries (IRR) and Internet Addressing Resource Registries, facilitating effective BGP prefix hijacks.

### 6.1 Certificate Authorities
Hijacking an account under a CA allows the adversary to revoke, renew, or issue new certificates for domains registered under the hijacked account. Some CAs do not validate certificate renewal requests, making it easier for the adversary to associate new key-pairs with existing certificates.

### 6.2 Domain Registrars
Hijacking accounts of domain registrars enables the adversary to manipulate domain records, such as launching phishing attacks.

### 6.3 IaaS Providers
Hijacking accounts of IaaS providers allows the adversary to take over virtual machines and the resources running on those machines, including databases, applications, and computations.

## 7. Risk Assessment

We assess the fraction of digital resources (IP address blocks and domains) that are at immediate risk due to being associated with vulnerable accounts. Our analysis provides insights into the potential impact of these attacks and the need for urgent mitigations.

## 8. Countermeasures

We recommend the following countermeasures to mitigate the risks of off-path DNS cache poisoning attacks:
- **Implement DNSSEC**: Deploy DNSSEC to authenticate DNS records.
- **Enhance Randomization**: Improve the randomization of UDP source ports and TXIDs.
- **Monitor and Detect Anomalies**: Implement monitoring and anomaly detection systems to identify and respond to suspicious activities.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for account access to add an additional layer of security.

## 9. Conclusion

Our work demonstrates the insecurity of current practices in managing Internet resources and the ease with which adversaries can take over and manipulate these resources. While we recommend several countermeasures, fundamental changes in the management of Internet resources are necessary to ensure long-term security.
