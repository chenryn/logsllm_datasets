### 4.4. Simulation Results

Figures 1–4 present per-receiver results obtained from six typical traces out of the 14 studied. The results for the remaining traces were very similar, and due to space limitations, only the results for these six traces are depicted.

**Figure 1: Average Normalized Recovery Times**

Figure 1 shows the average normalized recovery times achieved by SRM (Standard Recovery Mechanism) and CESRM (Caching-based Expedited Recovery Mechanism). The recovery time for each receiver is normalized by that receiver’s RTT (Round-Trip Time) estimate to the source, and is therefore given in units of RTT. From Figure 1, it is evident that the caching-based expedited recovery scheme employed by CESRM significantly reduces the average normalized recovery time. For most receivers, CESRM’s average recovery times are 40% to 70% (50% on average) smaller than those of SRM.

**Figure 2: Difference in Average Normalized Recovery Times**

Figure 2 depicts the difference in the average normalized recovery times between expedited and non-expedited recoveries of CESRM. Equations (1) and (2) presented in Section 3.4 predicted that, for the scheduling parameters used in our simulations, the difference between the average recovery times of expedited and non-expedited recoveries would be roughly bounded by 2.25 RTT. Figure 2 confirms this prediction, showing that the difference in the average normalized recovery latency between expedited and non-expedited successful recoveries ranges from 1 RTT to 2.5 RTT.

**Figure 3: Number of Request Packets Sent**

Figure 3 illustrates the number of request packets sent by each receiver using SRM and CESRM. The bars corresponding to CESRM are split into two components: the white component represents requests unicast by the expeditious requestor as part of CESRM’s expedited recovery process, while the gray component represents requests multicast when CESRM falls back on SRM’s recovery scheme. The source of the IP multicast transmission corresponds to receiver 0.

Figure 3 reveals that, for most receivers in each simulation, the number of requests sent by CESRM is less than the number sent by SRM. In some cases, the number of requests sent by CESRM exceeds that of SRM. However, a significant portion of the requests sent by CESRM are unicast from specific requestors to specific repliers, rather than multicast to the entire group. Since unicast transmissions are substantially less costly than multicast transmissions, the overhead associated with sending requests in CESRM is significantly lower than that in SRM.

**Figure 4: Number of Reply Packets Sent**

Figure 4 shows the number of reply packets sent by each receiver using SRM and CESRM. The bars represent the total number of reply packets sent, with the same color coding as in Figure 3. The results indicate that CESRM generally requires fewer reply packets compared to SRM, further reducing the overall network overhead.

### Summary

- **Figure 1**: CESRM reduces average normalized recovery times by 40% to 70%.
- **Figure 2**: The difference in average normalized recovery times between expedited and non-expedited recoveries ranges from 1 RTT to 2.5 RTT.
- **Figure 3**: CESRM sends fewer request packets, with a significant portion being unicast, reducing overhead.
- **Figure 4**: CESRM requires fewer reply packets, further reducing network overhead.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CESRM in improving recovery times and reducing network overhead compared to the standard SRM.
