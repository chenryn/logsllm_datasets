limitations, we do not include these results here.
4.4. Simulation Results
Figures 1–4 present per-receiver results obtained with 6
typical traces of the 14 studied traces. The results obtained
with the remaining traces were very similar. Due to space
limitations, we depict only the results obtained for these 6.
Figure 1 presents the per-receiver average normalized re-
covery times achieved by SRM and CESRM. The recov-
ery time of each receiver is normalized by that receiver’s
RTT estimate to the source, and is therefore given in units
of RTT. From Figure 1, we can see that the caching-based
expedited recovery scheme employed by CESRM substan-
tially reduces the average normalized recovery time. For
most of the receivers, CESRM’s average recovery times are
40% to 70% (50% on average) smaller than SRM’s.
Figure 2 depicts the difference in the average normalized
recovery times between expedited and non-expedited recov-
eries of CESRM. Equations (1) and (2) presented in Sec-
tion 3.4 predicted that, for the scheduling parameters used
in our simulations, the difference between the average re-
covery times of expedited and non-expedited recoveries
would be roughly bounded by 2.25 RTT. Figure 2 indeed
reveals that, in our simulations, the difference in the av-

times between expedited and non-expedited recoveries of
CESRM.

erage normalized recovery latency between expedited and
non-expedited successful recoveries ranges from 1 RTT to
2.5 RTT.
Figure 3 depicts the number of request packets sent by
each of the receivers with SRM and CESRM. The bars cor-
responding to CESRM are split into two components. The
white component corresponds to requests unicast by the ex-
peditious requestor as part of CESRM’s expedited recovery
process; the gray component corresponds to requests that
are multicast when CESRM falls back on SRM’s recovery
scheme. The source of the IP multicast transmission corre-
sponds to receiver 0.
Figure 3 reveals that, for most receivers in each of the
simulations, the number of requests sent by CESRM is less
than the number sent by SRM. For some of the receivers the
number of requests sent by CESRM exceeds that sent by
SRM. Notably, however, a large portion of the requests sent
by CESRM are unicast from particular requestors to partic-
ular repliers, rather than multicast to the entire group. Since
unicast transmissions are substantially less costly than mul-
ticast transmissions, the overhead associated with sending
requests in CESRM is substantially smaller than that in-
curred in SRM.

each of the receivers with SRM and CESRM. The bars
