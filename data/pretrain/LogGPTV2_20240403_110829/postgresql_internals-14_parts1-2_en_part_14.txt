6.6. Managing the Load
Operatingatthepagelevel,vacuumingdoesnotblockotherprocesses;butnever-
theless,it increases the system load and can have a noticeable impact on perfor-
mance.
VacuumThrottling
To control vacuuming intensity, Postgre makes regular pauses in table pro-
200 cessing. Aftercompletingaboutvacuum_cost_limitunitsofwork,theprocessfalls
0 asleepandremainsidleforthevacuum_cost_delaytimeinterval.
Thedefaultzerovalueofvacuum_cost_delay meansthatroutinevacuumingactu-
ally never sleeps,so the exact vacuum_cost_limit value makes no difference. It is
assumedthatifadministratorshavetoresorttomanualvacuuming,theyarelikely
toexpectitscompletionassoonaspossible.
If the sleep time is set, then the process will pause each time it has spent vac-
p. uum_cost_limit units of work on page processing in the buffer cache. The cost of

AutovacuumThrottling
Throttling for autovacuum1 is quite similar to throttling. However,auto-
vacuumcanberunwithadifferentintensityasithasitsownsetofparameters:
• autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit −1
• autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay 2ms
Ifanyoftheseparametersissetto−1,itfallsbackonthecorrespondingparameter
for regular. Thus,the autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit parameter relies on
thevacuum_cost_limitvaluebydefault.
Priortoversion,thedefaultvalueofautovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay wasms,andit
ledtoverypoorperformanceonmodernhardware.

6.7. Monitoring
Ifvacuumingismonitored,youcandetectsituationswhendeadtuplescannotbe
removed in one go, as references to them do not fit the maintenance_work_mem
memorychunk. Inthiscase,alltheindexeswillhavetobefullyscannedseveral
times. It can take a substantial amount of time for large tables, thus creating a
significantloadonthesystem. Eventhoughquerieswillnotbeblocked,extra/
operationscanseriouslylimitsystemthroughput.
Such issues can be corrected either by vacuuming the table more often (so that
eachruncleansupfewertuples)orbyallocatingmorememory.

VACUUM
All in all, there have been three index scans; each scan has removed ,
pointers to dead tuples at the most. This value is defined by the number of
tid pointers (each of them takes  bytes) that can fit into an array of the main-
tenance_work_mem size. The maximum size possible is shown by pg_stat_prog-

MonitoringAutovacuum
The main approach to monitoring autovacuum is to print its status information
(which is similar to the output of the   command) into the server
log for further analysis. If the log_autovacuum_min_duration parameter is set to −1
zero,allautovacuumrunsarelogged:
=> ALTER SYSTEM SET log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0;
=> SELECT pg_reload_conf();
=> UPDATE vac SET s = 'C';

Chapter6. VacuumandAutovacuum
To track the list of tables that have to be vacuumed and analyzed, you can use
theneed_vacuumandneed_analyzeviews,whichwehavealreadyreviewed. Ifthis
list grows, it means that autovacuum does not cope with the load and has to be
spedupbyeitherreducingthegap(autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay)orincreasing
theamountofworkdonebetweenthegaps(autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit). Itis
notunlikelythatthedegreeofparallelismwillalsohavetobeincreased(autovac-
uum_max_workers).

7.1. Transaction ID Wraparound
InPostgre,atransactiontakesbits. Fourbillionsseemstobequiteabig
number,butitcanbeexhaustedveryfastifthesystemisbeingactivelyused. For
example,for an average load of , transactions per second (excluding virtual
ones),itwillhappeninaboutsixweeksofcontinuousoperation.
Once all the numbers are used up, the counter has to be reset to start the next
round (this situation is called a“wraparound”). But a transactionwith a smaller
 can only be considered older than another transaction with a bigger  if the
assignednumbersarealwaysincreasing.Sothecountercannotsimplystartusing
thesamenumbersanewafterbeingreset.
Allocating  bits for transaction s would have eliminated this problem alto-
gether, so why doesn’t Postgre take advantage of it? The thing is that each
tupleheaderhastostoresfortwotransactions: xminandxmax. Theheaderis p.
quite big already (at least  bytes if data alignment is taken into account), and
addingmorebitswouldhavegivenanotherbytes.
Postgre does implement -bit transaction s1 that extend a regular  bya -bit
epoch,buttheyareusedonlyinternallyandnevergetintodatapages.
Tocorrectlyhandlewraparound,Postgrehastocomparetheageoftransactions

Youcanimaginethatthexmintransactionisreplacedinfrozentuplesbyahy-
pothetical“minus infinity”(pictured as a snowflake below); it is a sign that this
tuple is created by a transaction that is so far in the past that its actual  does
notmatteranymore.Yetinrealityxminremainsunchanged,whereasthefreezing

The xmax transaction  does not participate in freezing in any way. It is only
present in outdated tuples, and once such tuples stop being visible in all snap-
shots(whichmeansthatthexmaxisbeyondthedatabasehorizon),theywillbe
