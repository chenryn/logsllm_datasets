Tenants. As shown in Table 1, we divide the 13 servers among
the four tenants. There are three benign tenants and one attacker
(tenant #4). The total capacity of the three benign tenants is 1,300W
and the capacity of the attacker is 200W (i.e., 13% of the total capac-
ity subscription). The data center power capacity is 1,250W with
120% oversubscription (i.e., sold as 1,500W) [11, 17].
Workload traces. Like in the prior research [8, 11], the four
tenants’ server power usage follows four different power traces.
Traces for two of the benign tenants are collected from Facebook
and Baidu workloads [14, 45], while the other two power traces
are generated offline using workload traces (SHARCNET and RICC
logs) from [46, 47]. These power traces are scaled to have 75%
utilization for the benign tenants and 65% utilization for the attacker.
We assign a real workload trace to the attacker so that it behaves
normally as benign tenants and stays stealthy. The tenants’ total
power consumption is shown in Fig. 13. While we use these power
traces to reflect the temporal variation in tenants’ power usage for
our evaluation, our approach to timing power attacks also applies for
any other power traces.
Duration. We run the experiment for 12 hours and record the
power consumption and voltage readings. We also run simulation
studies by extending our 12-hour experiment into one year. Specifi-
cally, we split the 12-hour data into 10-minute pieces and randomly
order them into yearly voltage signals and corresponding power
readings. In our yearly trace, the attack opportunities take up 7.5%
of the time, consistent with the settings in [8, 11]. Note that, be-
cause they are transmitted over power lines, the voltage ripples do
not vary significantly over time given a certain power level. Thus,
our extended trace still preserves the voltage signal patterns that
we would otherwise see in real experiments and hence suffices for
our purpose of evaluating the timing accuracy.
Others. By default, in Algorithm 2, we set the frequency band as
F = 1kHz, and the scanning lower and upper bounds as Flb =55kHz
and Fub =80kHz, respectively. We set Twait =2 minutes, Tattack=10
minutes, and Thold=10 minutes. We perform frequency analysis of
the voltage signal over each one-second segment.
5.2 Results
We first focus on how well the attacker can track tenants’ aggregate
power usage at runtime based on the voltage side channel, and then
turn to how well the attacker can time its power attacks.
Tracking tenants’ power usage. We apply Algorithm 1 to de-
tect groups of PSD spikes (i.e., different tenants in our case) and see
how well the per-group aggregate PSD represents the correspond-
ing servers’ power consumption. As the attacker knows its own
power usage, we separate its own spikes from the PSD scanning
process. Fig. 12 shows the three benign tenants’ power usage and
the corresponding group-wise aggregate PSD from our 12-hour
experiment. We see that the aggregate PSDs and the power usage
have a strong correlation for all tenants (with correlation coeffi-
cient ranging from 0.9 to 0.98), demonstrating the effectiveness of
the voltage side channel in extracting the power usage of benign
tenants. Note that, for a similar power level, tenant #1 has a lower
aggregate PSD than the other two tenants. This further confirms
that we need to look at group-wise aggregate PSD to track the
power of each server group. We show the power vs. PSD for the
three traces in Appendix C.
Next, we study the impact of the choice of frequency band F
in Algorithm 1 on the power-PSD relation. We see from Fig. 12(d)
that the correlation between the power usage and the resulting
aggregate PSD is not quite sensitive to the choice of F, provided
that it is higher than 0.5kHz (to include all the PSD spikes).
Illustration of power attacks. Section 4.6 and Algorithm 2
guide the attacker to time power attacks based on the sum of group-
wise aggregate PSD of its measured voltage signal. We now illustrate
in Fig. 13 a 12-hour trace in our experiment. Concretely, Fig. 13
includes the aggregate power usage (without power attacks), sum
of group-wise aggregate PSD, malicious power loads injected by the
attacker, and attack opportunities. There are three attack opportuni-
ties in 12 hours, each lasting less than 30 minutes and emphasizing
the need for precisely timing attacks. We see that two successful at-
tacks are launched during the attack opportunity windows around
the 4th and 8th hour. The attacker also launches unsuccessful at-
tacks around the 4th hour and 10th hour. Note that Fig. 13 is to

outage occurs due to a power attack, then the power trace following
the outage would be changed as servers are out of power.
Timing statistics. We now look into the timing accuracy of our
proposed threshold-based attack strategy described in Algorithm 2.
Fig. 14(a) shows the impact of the threshold value Pth. Naturally,
with a lower threshold, the attacker will attack more frequently, but
there will be more unsuccessful attacks because the total available
attack opportunities remain unchanged.
We consider two metrics for timing accuracy: True positive rate:
the percentage of attack opportunity captured by the attacker to
launch successful attacks. Precision: the percentage of power attacks
that are successful.
Fig. 14(b) shows the evaluation results under different attack
thresholds Pth. We see that the true positive rate is high when the
attacker sets a lower threshold and launches more attacks, conse-
quently capturing more attack opportunities. Nonetheless, the true
positive rate may not always increase by lowering the threshold.
This is because of the attack strategy in Algorithm 2: with a low
triggering threshold, the attacker sometimes launches an attack
prematurely and hence misses on actual attack opportunity that
follows immediately, due to the holding time Thold (to meet con-
tractual terms and stay stealthy) before launching another attack.
When the triggering threshold is higher, the attacker is more conser-
vative and launches attacks only when it anticipates a sufficiently
high aggregate power by benign tenants. Thus, the precision rate
increases as the threshold increases.
Impact of attacker size. For stealthiness, the attacker behaves
as a benign tenant and launches attacks by increasing its power
only to its subscribed capacity (i.e., allowed power limit). Now, we
show the impact of the attacker’s size (i.e., its subscribed power
capacity) on the detection statistics in Fig. 15(a). For this, we keep
the benign tenants’ capacity fixed and increase both the attacker
and data center capacity while we also limit the total attacks under
10% of the time. Naturally, there are more attack opportunities if the
attacker has a larger power capacity as it can more easily elevate
the aggregate power by itself to create capacity overloads. We also
see that true positive rate goes down while the precision goes up
when the attacker’s power capacity becomes larger. This is because
we keep the attack time percentage fixed at 10%. As a result, even
with more attack opportunities, the attacker cannot launch more
frequent attacks and hence misses more attack opportunities (i.e.,
lower true positive rate) while its chance of capturing an actual
attack opportunity increases (i.e., higher precision).
Although increasing the attacker’s power capacity allows the
attacker to launch successful power attacks more easily, the attacker
also needs to spend more money for its power capacity subscription
and equipment. We now study the cost impact of power attacks.
All the costs are normalized with respect to the attacker’s own cost
when it subscribes 5% of the total subscribed power capacity. We
estimate the cost based on the method provided in [11]. The results
are shown in Fig. 15(b), demonstrating that the attacker only needs
to spend a tiny fraction (3% ∼ 16% in our study) of the total resulting
losses for the data center operator and other benign tenants. Our
findings are similar to those in [8, 11]. In practice, these normalized
values correspond to tens of million dollars even for a relatively
small data center with only 1MW power capacity [11].

the timing the power attacks with two other attack strategies.
Comparison with other attack strategies. We now compare
• Peak-aware random attack: This strategy is an improved version
of purely random attacks and assumes that the attacker knows the
probability of when attack opportunities arise per hour and allocate
its total attack times to maximize its overall success rate.
• ∆V -based attack: As described in Section 4.2, the attacker sim-
We compare these different attack strategies in terms of their
true positive rates and precisions and show the results in Fig. 16.
We see that our proposed approach to timing attacks significantly
outperforms the peak-aware random attack and ∆V -based attack
under our default total attack time of 10%, demonstrating the need
of a precise timing for attacks. Importantly, the voltage reading in
RMS can be misleading for indicating attack opportunities, since it
is predominantly affected by the UPS output voltage VU PS rather
than the line voltage drop. Note that if the attacker attacks more
frequently, the peak-aware random attack and our approach come
closer to each other in terms of the timing accuracy. Nonetheless,
frequent attacks are not only prohibited by contracts [23], but also
will likely be detected as suspicious behavior.

Detection accuracy. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our
voltage side channel in detecting attack opportunities when the at-
tacker can attack consecutively without any restriction (e.g., Thold).
Fig. 17(a) shows the true positive rates for the cases with and with-
out consecutive attack restrictions. The gap between the two lines
indicates that although the voltage side channel can identify attack
opportunities, the holding time before launching a new attack for
stealthiness and contract constraints can result in a few missing
opportunities. Fig. 17(b) shows that our voltage side channel can
identify most of the attack opportunities with a low false positive
rate. By comparison, the random attack strategy performs rather
poorly, and the ∆-based attack is even worse because the measured
voltage VN is mostly affected by the grid and UPS operations rather
than tenants’ aggregate power (Section 4.2).
6 EXTENSION TO THREE-PHASE SYSTEM
Our previous sections focus on a single-phase power distribution
that is mostly used in edge multi-tenant data centers. Next, we
extend our study to a three-phase system that is commonly used in
large-scale multi-tenant data centers [48].
6.1 Three-Phase Power Distribution System
All large data centers use three-phase AC distributions to deliver
power at high efficiency [49]. Each PDU supports 40 ∼ 200kW
of server power (10 ∼ 50 server racks) and is oversubscribed by
the data center operator, and each tenant typically houses at least
one full dedicated server rack. Here, we consider an attacker with
multiple server racks sharing one oversubscribed PDU with benign
tenants.
There are a few different ways to connect servers in a three-
phase system. We show in Fig. 18 the most widely-used three-phase
systems, where the servers are connected to two of the phases with
a supply voltage at 208V [49]. This is also the most complicated
case since each server/server rack is connected to and hence also
affected by two different phases. We show another two types of
three-phase systems in Appendix H.
6.1.1 Voltage equations in a three-phase system. As illustrated in
Fig. 18, all the server racks connected to the same two phases are
considered as one cluster. We represent the total load of each server
cluster using their combined current Iab, Ibc, and Ica, respectively.
Like in Section 4, because the voltage levels are relatively fixed
(apart from some temporal variations around the nominal levels),
the current flowing into each server cluster are a good indicator of
the cluster’s power usage.
Figure 18: 3-phase power distribution with 2-phase racks.
A distinguishing feature of the three-phase connection is that
each server rack is connected to two phases. For each phase, the line
voltage drop is affected by the current flowing from the UPS output
to the PDU. As shown in the current flow equations in Fig. 18, the
line current for each phase jointly depends on two server clusters.
Next, by ignoring the practically negligible line voltage drop
between the PDU and servers, we write the voltage Vab, which is
supplied by the PDU to the server cluster connected to phase A and
phase B, as follows:
Vab = Va − Vb = VA − IA · RL − (VB − IB · RL)
= VAB − RL · (IA − IB)
= VAB − RL · (2Iab − Ibc − Ica),
where the last step follows from IA = Iab − Ica and IB = Ibc − Iab.
Similarly we can also write
Vbc = VBC − RL · (−Iab + 2Ibc − Ica)
Vca = VCA − RL · (−Iab − Ibc + 2Ica).
6.1.2 Exploiting the voltage side channel in a three-phase system.
Like in the single-phase system (Section 4.3), we apply a high-
