4.2. Authentication probability lower bound
In  [10],  the  authors  derived  a  lower  bound  of  the
authentication  probability  (for  the  piggybacking  scheme)
based  on  the  following  bursty  loss  model,  which  is
motivated by ideas in the theory of error-correction codes.
We denote this loss model as the Biased Coin Toss (BCT)
loss model for reasons stated below.
BCT  loss  model:  Let  q  be  a  nonnegative  fraction,  and
1>b
  an  integer.  For  all  i,  a  burst  of  length  b  packets
iP )  with
begins  with  packet 
probability q.

Note that for 
 this model is equivalent to the 2-

q=
(hence 
dependence of 
iS  (for all i), and hence, the loss
(or no loss) of a packet is determined by the toss of a q-
biased  coin,  where  the  coin  toss  associated  with  each
packet  is  independent.  For 
  this  model  produces
bursty  loss  patterns,  whereas  for 
,  it  produces
independent packet losses.

bound  of 
According  to  the  loss  model,  it  is  obvious  that  the
maximum number of places where a burst error can occur
(and  still  allow  the  guaranteed  authentication  of 
iP )  is
,  where   x   denotes  the  largest
given by 
integer  not  greater  than  x.  Here,  n  and  m  denote  the
number  of  encoded  pieces  and  the  minimum  number
needed  for  decoding,  respectively.  Because  the  loss  of  a
packet  is  determined  by  the  flip  of  a  q-biased  coin,  the
probability  that  z  or  fewer  coin  tosses  result  in  losses
lower  bounds  the  authentication  probability.  Hence,  the
authentication probability is bounded as follows:

Now,  using  a  similar  approach,  we  find  the  upper
bound.  The  authentication  probability  is  upper  bounded
by the probability of the number of packet losses between
1+iP  and

the verification  of
