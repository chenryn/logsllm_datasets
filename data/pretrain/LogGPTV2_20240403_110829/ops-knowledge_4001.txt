User: I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS; python 2.7.3 is pre-installed.
A bug in python 2.7 distribution has been fixed in their repository.
changeset 76420:ab9d6c4907e7 2.7
How do I apply this patch on my PC ?  
Thanks,
Vineet
Assistant: You can use the mercurial equivalents of following comands:

svn log
svn diff 
patch

The "hg" equivalents of the first two commands will identify all the files that have changed and the the changes in them. The last command will apply the patches.
Use the man command to get detailed usage information on the commands.
