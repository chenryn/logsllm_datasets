User: I have recently Installed Anaconda for Python 3.6 but it shows the error "Segmentation fault" whenever I try to run Anaconda-Navigator.
I've tried just writting in the terminal Anaconda-Navigator and also going to my Anaconda3 folder and try to execute it inside bin. 
The only solution that works so far is accessing the previously bin folder as root. My problem is that I need to activate TensorFlow before I run anything in my console, but that is imposible as a root user.
I've already try to upgrade both, Anaconda and Navigator and reinstall them but nothing ocurrs
Anyone here has any idea of what is happening?
Assistant: I had the same issue when I install OpenCV library using conda.Most probably downgrading something makes this issue happen. Just type :
conda update --all
