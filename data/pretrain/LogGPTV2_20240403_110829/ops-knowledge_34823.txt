I recently installed Anaconda for Python 3.6, but I encounter a "Segmentation fault" error whenever I try to run the Anaconda-Navigator. I have attempted to launch it by typing `Anaconda-Navigator` in the terminal and also by navigating to the `Anaconda3` folder and executing it from the `bin` directory. The only solution that has worked so far is running the `bin` folder as the root user. However, this approach is problematic because I need to activate TensorFlow before running anything in the console, which is not possible when logged in as the root user. I have already tried upgrading both Anaconda and Navigator, as well as reinstalling them, but the issue persists. Does anyone have any ideas about what might be causing this?

**Assistant:**

I experienced a similar issue after installing the OpenCV library using `conda`. It's likely that downgrading one of the dependencies or packages caused this problem. To resolve it, you can try updating all your conda packages with the following command:

```bash
conda update --all
```

This command will update all your conda packages to their latest versions, which may help resolve any compatibility issues.
