User: How to write a web crawler program in Python and scrape data from a specific website? Please provide routine.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python web crawler program to obtain news titles and links from Baidu News: ```python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # Website URL url = 'https://news.baidu.com/' # Send to The website sends a request and gets the response content response = requests.get(url) # Parse the response content into a BeautifulSoup object soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') # Find news titles and links for news in soup.select( '.ulist.focuslistnews > li'): title = news.select_one('a').text.strip() link = news.select_one('a')['href'] print(title, link) ``` Explanation: 1. The `requests` library is used to send HTTP requests and get the response content. 2. The `BeautifulSoup` library is used to parse HTML content. 3. `url` stores the URL of the website to be visited. 4. `requests.get(url)` Send a request to the website and get the response content. 5. `BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')` parses the response content into a BeautifulSoup object. 6. `soup.select('.ulist.focuslistnews > li')` finds all `<li>` elements under the element whose CSS class name is `ulist focuslistnews`. 7. `news.select_one('a').text.strip()` finds the first `<a>` element under the `<li>` element, and gets the text content of the element (namely the news title), And use the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters. 8. `news.select_one('a')['href']` finds the first `<a>` element under the `<li>` element, and gets the `href` attribute of the element (that is, the news link) . 9. `print(title, link)` print news title and link.
