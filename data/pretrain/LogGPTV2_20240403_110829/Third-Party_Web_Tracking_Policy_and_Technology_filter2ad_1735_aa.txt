Abstract—In the early days of the web, content was designed
and hosted by a single person, group, or organization. No
longer. Webpages are increasingly composed of content from
myriad unrelated “third-party” websites in the business of
advertising, analytics, social networking, and more. Third-
party services have tremendous value: they support free content
and facilitate web innovation. But third-party services come
at a privacy cost: researchers, civil society organizations, and
policymakers have increasingly called attention to how third
parties can track a user’s browsing activities across websites.
This paper surveys the current policy debate surrounding
third-party web tracking and explains the relevant technology.
It also presents the FourthParty web measurement platform and
studies we have conducted with it. Our aim is to inform re-
searchers with essential background and tools for contributing
to public understanding and policy debates about web tracking.
Keywords-Web privacy; third-party tracking; Do Not Track.
I. INTRODUCTION
The web has evolved to facilitate development and de-
livery of webpages composed of content from multiple
websites. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS impose no restrictions
on a webpage including elements from, or even delegating
complete control to, a wholly unrelated website.1 These
design choices have contributed to a host of well-known
and well-studied security vulnerabilities, including cross-site
scripting (XSS) [2] and cross-site request forgery (CSRF or
XSRF) [3], [4], that enable an unauthorized and unrelated
“third-party” website to retrieve information from or per-
form actions on the “ﬁrst-party” website that the user has
voluntarily interacted with.
This paper examines the privacy implications of the
opposite case—where a ﬁrst-party website authorizes a third-
party website to learn about its users (Figure 1).2 Third-party
services bring tremendous value to the web: they enable ﬁrst-
party websites to trivially implement advertising, analytics,
social network integration, and more. But they also give rise
to privacy concerns: over the past several years, researchers,
civil society organizations, and policymakers have called
attention to the increasing trend of third-party websites
recording and analyzing users’ browsing activities across

merits research attention.
unrelated ﬁrst-party websites (“third-party web tracking” or
“tracking” for short).3
This paper is intended to comprehensively familiarize
computer security and privacy researchers with current pol-
icy and technology research on third-party web tracking.
Much of the discussion is based on recent results from a new
dynamic web measurement platform, FourthParty. We begin
by presenting by FourthParty. The remainder of the paper
is organized into two parts on third-party web tracking: one
on policy, and one on technology.
The policy part opens by reviewing why third-party web
tracking gives rise to privacy concerns and ways in which
policy might be structured to address those concerns. It then
provides an overview of regulation and self-regulation in
the U.S. and EU, explaining the current governmental and
business approaches to mitigating privacy issues in third-
party web tracking. The discussion next turns to tracking
business models and trends. A ﬁnal section frames the
economic debate on third-party web tracking and notes gaps
in the current literature.
The technology part starts by surveying stateful and
stateless technologies that can be used to correlate users’
activities across websites. It next provides an overview of
technologies that enable the delivery of third-party services
with lessened privacy risk. Last, it reviews the user choice
and self-help technologies presently available, including opt-
out cookies, blocking, and Do Not Track.
This paper has a secondary aim. Debates on how to
respond to third-party web tracking are now occurring
every day in Washington and Brussels. We hope that by
systematizing knowledge on third-party web tracking for the
computer security and privacy community, we will ensure
that it is best able to assist policymakers in developing
solutions that adequately balance privacy, commerce, and
a thriving web.
II. FOURTHPARTY
A. Why Web Measurement?
We have found several advantages to placing web mea-
surement at the center of our methodology.
3There is, at present, signiﬁcant debate about the precise contours of a
“third party” and “tracking.” This paper focuses on the least ambiguous
case: an unafﬁliated website that collects a user’s browsing history.

Web measurement provides objective, reliable evidence
that both furthers public understanding and establishes a
sound basis for policymaking.
Second, web measurement is fast. Many claims about
speciﬁc tracking practices can be supported or rebutted with
mere hours of web measurement work.4
Web measurement facilitates longitudinal study. Often the
very same hardware and software can be reused to collect
and analyze data even years apart.
Last, web measurement can often be automated. Once a
generic measurement tool has been built, it can be trivially
applied to millions of websites.
B. Design Principles
Prior work on third-party web tracking has largely taken
one of three approaches to measurement: monitor network
trafﬁc (e.g. [10], [11], [12], [13]), manually inspect browser
state (e.g. [8], [14]), or develop a custom tool for a speciﬁc
measurement task (e.g. [15], [16], [17]).
We developed FourthParty around three design principles
that improve on these approaches.
4For example, when an advertising network contested our discovery
that it was “history snifﬁng” [7], we were able to secure independent
conﬁrmation from two other research groups the same day. When Ayenson
et al. [8], [9] contacted us on a weekday afternoon about a web analytics
company using multiple “supercookie” technologies (see Section VII-A),
we were able to verify their ﬁndings by evening.
1) General-purpose instrumentation: By implementing
comprehensive instrumentation and logging only once,
FourthParty avoids the need for many purpose-built tools,
decreases duplication of effort, and trims development time.
2) Production web browser: Building on a production
including for
browser allows reuse of existing add-ons,
automation, and closely emulates real-world browsing.
3) Standardized log format: A standardized, easy-to-
manipulate log format facilitates data sharing and cuts back
on redundant data gathering.
C. Implementation
We implemented FourthParty as an extension to Mozilla
Firefox. It currently instruments the browser APIs for HTTP
trafﬁc, DOM windows, cookies, and resource loads. Fourth-
Party also instruments JavaScript API calls on the window,
navigator, and screen objects using getters, setters,
and ECMAScript proxies [18]. All events are logged to a
SQLite database.
On many pages FourthParty does not perceivably slow
down Firefox; on highly dynamic pages, it can increase page
load time by roughly 2-3x. We plan to make substantial
performance improvements in an upcoming revision.
D. Analysis with FourthParty
Analyzing FourthParty data is fast. All of the FourthParty
results presented in this paper were generated with Python

scripts, most of which took seconds to execute on a con-
sumer notebook with databases including visits to thousands
of popular websites.
Analyzing FourthParty data is also easy for researchers
who are already familiar with SQL syntax. For example,
a query that counts Google Analytics reports with an
anonymizeIp instruction (see Section VIII-B) is just:
select count(*) from http_requests
where url like
’%google-analytics.com/__utm.gif%&aip=1%’
See http://fourthparty.info for the FourthParty
source and related resources.
in this paper,
We used FourthParty to conduct many of studies we
present
including on information leakage
(Section III-B3), tracking technologies (Section VII), and
blocking tool effectiveness (Section IX-B).
THIRD-PARTY WEB TRACKING POLICY
III. PRIVACY PROBLEMS
This section reviews the privacy implications of third-
party web tracking and notes the range of policy responses.
The discussion proceeds in four phases. First, it details the
browsing history information that is available to third parties
and how that information is identiﬁable. Second, it explains
how third-party web tracking could harm users. Third, it
reviews survey results consistently showing that users would
prefer to not be tracked. Last, it details the policy positions
that various stakeholders have adopted in response.
A. Information Available
Web browsing history is inextricably linked to personal
information. The pages a user visits can reveal her location,
interests, purchases, employment status, sexual orientation,
ﬁnancial challenges, medical conditions, and more. Exam-
ining individual page loads is often adequate to draw many
conclusions about a user; analyzing patterns of activity
allows yet more inferences.
When a ﬁrst-party page embeds third-party content, the
third-party website is ordinarily made aware of the URL of
the ﬁrst-party page through an HTTP referrer or equivalent.5
If the page embeds a script tag from a third party,
the third party will also often learn the web page’s title
from document.title. Some ﬁrst parties will voluntar-
ily transmit even more information.
Collection of sensitive personal
information is not a
hypothetical concern. In mid-2011 we discovered that an
advertising network, Epic Marketplace, had publicly exposed
its interest segment data, offering a rare glimpse of what
third-party trackers seek to learn about users [7]. User
segments included menopause, getting pregnant, repairing

bad credit, and debt relief. Several months later we found
that the free online dating website OkCupid was sending to
the data provider Lotame how often a user drinks, smokes,
and does drugs [19]. When Krishnamurthy et al. [10] tested
search queries on ten popular health websites, they found a
third party learned of the user’s query on nine of them.
B. Identiﬁability
A web browsing history is often personally identiﬁed or
identiﬁable. Narayanan [20] recently proposed a taxonomy
of ﬁve ways in which a pseudonymous6 browsing history
might become identiﬁed. Note that pseudonymity is quite
fragile in protecting identity: discovering a user’s identity
once in a pseudonymous system is sufﬁcient to also identify
past and future interactions with the user.
1) The third party is also a ﬁrst party: The third party
may be a ﬁrst party in another context, where the user
voluntarily provided her identity. Facebook, for example, has
over 800 million users and enforces a requirement that users
provide their real name to the service. When a page includes
a third-party Facebook social widget, Facebook identiﬁes the
user to personalize the widget.
3) A ﬁrst party unintentionally provides identity:
2) A ﬁrst party sells the user’s identity: Some ﬁrst-party
websites voluntarily provide (“leak”) a user’s identity to
third parties for pay. Some have even made a business
model of it, usually appearing as a free sweepstakes or quiz.
Several advertising data providers (e.g. Datalogix [21]) buy
identifying information, retrieve the user’s dossier from an
ofﬂine consumer database, and use it to target advertising.
If a
website puts identifying information in a URL or page
title, it may unintentionally leak the information to third
parties. In a 2011 paper [10], Krishnamurthy et al. examined
signup and interaction with 120 popular sites for information
leakage to third parties. They reported that an aggregate of
48% leaked a user identiﬁer7 in a Request-URI or referrer.
Using a similar methodology, we examined identifying
information leakage on the Quantcast U.S. top 250 websites
[19]. We were able to test signup and interaction with 185
of the sites; we found that a username or user ID was sent to
a domain with a different public sufﬁx + 1 (PS+1)8 on 113
(61%) of the websites in our sample. The ﬁve most frequent
recipients and most proliﬁc senders of username and user
ID are presented in Table I and Table II respectively.
In the majority of instances the username or user ID was
part of a user proﬁle URL or page title. A better practice
6We consider a web tracking system to be pseudonymous if it allows,
with moderate probability, correlation of web activities by a device or user.
7While there is room for further conﬁrmatory research, there appears to
already be substantial evidence that usernames and user IDs can trivially be
used to identify a user [22], [23], [24], [25]. Some companies have already
deployed username-based matching in their products, including for social
user matching APIs (e.g. InfoChimps), creating user proﬁles (e.g. Spokeo),
and recommending account linkage (e.g. Google Social Search).
8Public sufﬁx + 1 is an alternative to top-level domain + 1 that is more
accurate for purposes of privacy measurement. See [26].

would be to use a single URL for all users viewing their
own proﬁle, e.g. http://example.com/self/, and to
never include the username or user ID in the page title.
Several of the sites we contacted were willing to implement
these ﬁxes, but many more preferred the functionality, con-
venience, and aesthetic of a username or user ID in URLs.
It seems quite likely the practice will persist indeﬁnitely
among even the most popular sites.
We also observed other forms of identifying information
leak. For example:
• Viewing a local ad on the Home Depot website sent the
user’s ﬁrst name and email address to 13 companies.
• Entering the wrong password on the Wall Street Journal
website sent the user’s email address to 7 companies.
• Changing user settings on the video-sharing site Meta-
cafe sent ﬁrst name, last name, birthday, email address,
physical address, and phone numbers to 2 companies.
In all of these cases the identifying information was
included as a parameter in a ﬁrst-party URL. The better
practice is to send identifying information as part of a POST
request body so it will not inadvertently leak to third parties.
4) The third party uses a security exploit: A third party
may exploit a cross-site security vulnerability on a ﬁrst-party
website to learn the user’s identity. Narayanan has shown
how inadequate frame busting can facilitate identifying a
user [27]. Huang and Jackson more recently demonstrated
practical user identiﬁcation through Facebook and Twitter
sharing widget clickjacking [28].
5) Re-identiﬁcation: The
third party could match
pseudonymous browsing histories against identiﬁed datasets
to re-identify them, much like Narayanan and Shmatikov did
with the Netﬂix Prize dataset [29] and the Flickr and Twitter
social graphs [30], and Acquisti et al. did more recently with
personal photos on a dating site [31]. A third party might,
for example, compare browsing activity to the times and
locations of links publicly shared by Twitter users.

The risk of harm to consumers from web tracking arises
from myriad potential scenarios. Each particular scenario
may have a low probability of occurring. But the chance
of some scenarios occurring is substantial, especially when
considered over time and across many companies.
When considering harmful web tracking scenarios, we
ﬁnd it helpful to focus on four variables. First, an actor that
causes harm to a consumer. The actor might, for example,
be an authorized employee, malicious employee, competitor,
acquirer, hacker, or government agency. Second, a means
of access that enables the actor to use tracking data. The
data might be voluntarily transferred, sold, stolen, misplaced,
