## Abstract
In the early days of the web, content was typically designed and hosted by a single entity. Today, webpages are increasingly composed of content from various unrelated "third-party" websites, which provide services such as advertising, analytics, and social networking. While these third-party services offer significant value, they also raise privacy concerns. This paper surveys the current policy debate surrounding third-party web tracking and explains the relevant technologies. We introduce the FourthParty web measurement platform and present studies conducted using it. Our goal is to provide researchers with essential background and tools to contribute to public understanding and policy debates about web tracking.

**Keywords:** Web privacy, third-party tracking, Do Not Track

## 1. Introduction
The web has evolved to facilitate the development and delivery of webpages that include content from multiple sources. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS do not restrict a webpage from including elements from or delegating control to unrelated websites. This design choice has led to well-known security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

This paper focuses on the privacy implications when a first-party website authorizes a third-party website to learn about its users. Third-party services, while valuable, raise privacy concerns due to their ability to track user activities across different first-party websites. This practice, known as "third-party web tracking," has garnered attention from researchers, civil society organizations, and policymakers.

## 2. FourthParty: A Web Measurement Platform
### 2.1 Why Web Measurement?
Web measurement provides several advantages:
- **Objective Evidence:** It offers reliable data for public understanding and policymaking.
- **Speed:** Claims about specific tracking practices can be verified quickly.
- **Longitudinal Studies:** The same tools can be used to collect and analyze data over extended periods.
- **Automation:** Once developed, a generic measurement tool can be applied to millions of websites.

### 2.2 Design Principles
FourthParty was developed with the following principles:
1. **General-Purpose Instrumentation:** Comprehensive logging reduces the need for multiple purpose-built tools.
2. **Production Web Browser:** Building on a production browser allows for reuse of existing add-ons and automation.
3. **Standardized Log Format:** A standardized log format facilitates data sharing and reduces redundant data gathering.

### 2.3 Implementation
FourthParty is implemented as a Mozilla Firefox extension. It instruments browser APIs for HTTP traffic, DOM windows, cookies, and resource loads. JavaScript API calls on the window, navigator, and screen objects are also logged. Events are stored in a SQLite database.

### 2.4 Analysis with FourthParty
Analyzing FourthParty data is efficient. Python scripts generate results quickly, even with large datasets. SQL queries make it easy for researchers to analyze the data. For example, a query to count Google Analytics reports with an anonymizeIp instruction is straightforward.

## 3. Privacy Problems
### 3.1 Information Available
Web browsing history reveals personal information such as location, interests, and more. When a first-party page embeds third-party content, the third-party website often learns the URL and sometimes additional information. Sensitive personal information, such as health conditions and financial challenges, can be collected.

### 3.2 Identifiability
A web browsing history can be personally identifiable through various means:
1. **Third Party as First Party:** The third party may be a first party in another context where the user provided their identity.
2. **First Party Sells Identity:** Some first-party websites sell user identities to third parties.
3. **Unintentional Leakage:** First-party websites may unintentionally leak identifying information.
4. **Security Exploits:** Third parties may exploit security vulnerabilities to identify users.
5. **Re-identification:** Pseudonymous browsing histories can be matched against identified datasets.

### 3.3 Possible Harms
Harmful scenarios can arise from various actors, such as employees, competitors, or hackers, gaining access to tracking data. The risk of harm, while low for individual scenarios, becomes substantial over time and across many companies.

## 4. Conclusion
This paper aims to comprehensively familiarize computer security and privacy researchers with the current policy and technology research on third-party web tracking. By systematizing this knowledge, we hope to assist policymakers in developing solutions that balance privacy, commerce, and a thriving web.
