User: How to remotely log in to the server through the SSH protocol while protecting the security of the account?
Assistant: The following are the steps to remotely log in to the server through the SSH protocol and protect the account security: 1. Create an ordinary user who is not the root administrator, and grant the user sudo authority. 2. Connect to the server through the SSH protocol. For example, use the following command to connect to the server: ssh username@server_ip where username is the name of the normal user you created and server_ip is the IP address of the server. 3. After confirming the connection, you will be asked to enter a password. During this step, make sure to protect your account with a strong password. 4. Enable a firewall on the server and only open required ports such as HTTP and HTTPS. This prevents unauthorized access. 5. Use public key authentication instead of password authentication. This will make it difficult for an attacker to hack and gain access to your server. Public key authentication is based on generating a key pair, which consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is stored on the server, while the private key is kept by you on your computer. On future connection attempts, SSH will use the public key to authenticate you. 6. Forbid the root user to log in through SSH. This is because root is the most privileged user on a Linux system. If the root account is occupied by an attacker, it may cause serious security problems. 7. Set the parameters on the server to automatically disconnect the SSH connection after a long period of inactivity to ensure security. 8. Change passwords regularly to prevent threats and update operating systems and software regularly for security updates. By following the above steps, you can ensure the security of the remote login server of the SSH protocol.
