Table 2: Communication cost in KB and running time in milliseconds of PSI protocols on the set size 𝑛. “SH", “1M", and “2M"
refer to semi-honest, 1-sided malicious and 2-sided malicious protocol, respectively. Cells with "—" denote setting not supported

The decoding function takes a string 𝑟 and produces the 𝑥 coor-
dinate of a point on Curve25519. The value 𝑥 can be computed as
𝑥 = 𝑒𝑑 − (1 − 𝑒) 𝐴
1+2𝑟 2 and 𝑒 = (𝑑3 + 𝐴𝑑2 + 𝑑) 𝑞−1
We implemented elligator on top of the Curve25519 implementa-
tion from libsodium. From our experimental evaluation, libsodium
is about 10× faster than miracl library.
The length of elligator encodings is slightly less than 256 bits. In
order to promote these encodings to be uniform in {0, 1}256, we can
append a few extra uniform bits which are ignored during decoding.
These additional bits can be considered as part of the randomness
in the KA protocol, and they cause the protocol messages to be
pseudorandom in F = {0, 1}256.
.

Other Primitives. We instantiate the necessary random oracles us-
ing SHA2. Since the elliptic curves have 256-bit encodings, we need
an ideal permutation Π± defined over {0, 1}256. In our implementa-
tion we use Rijndal-256 with a fixed key as the ideal permutation.
Polynomial Operations. Our protocol requires the receiver to
generate a polynomial of degree 𝑛, and the sender to evaluate it
on 𝑛 points. It is known that these problems could be solved by La-
grange interpolation and Horner evaluation which requires 𝑂(𝑛2)
field operations. However, when 𝑛 is very large (e.g. 𝑛 = 220) this
becomes impractical. Moenck and Borodin [41] describe algorithms
for these problems in 𝑂(𝑛 log2(𝑛)) field operations, which make
them a better fit for our protocol.
Security Parameters. All evaluations were performed with a PSI
item length of 128 bits, computational security parameter 𝜅 = 128
bits, and a statistical security parameter 𝜆 = 40 bits.
