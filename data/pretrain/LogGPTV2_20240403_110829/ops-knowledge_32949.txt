User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Debugging strategy for PHP-FPM So I'm just setting up nginx and php5-fpm on my VPS, having moved over from Apache. I'm running Debian Squeeze, with the latest PHP from the dotdeb.org repo (that means PHP 5.4.13-1~dotdeb.1).

I am having trouble getting php5-fpm going. When run sudo /etc/init.d/php5-fpm start, I don't get any confirmation, nor any error signals. Same for running sudo /etc/init.d/php5-fpm stop. If I pass it the status arg (sudo /etc/init.d/php5-fpm status), it returns php5-fpm is not running ... failed!

Now I can't see any errors in any log, so I'm at a losss as to how to even start to debug the problem.

Has anyone experience similar problems, or knows what I should do next?

Assistant: # /etc/init.d/php5-fpm check
[19-Apr-2013 19:29:26] NOTICE: configuration file /etc/php5/fpm/php-fpm.conf test is successful


Try to use this :)

or

# /etc/init.d/php7.4-fpm status


(replace 7.4 with your version)
