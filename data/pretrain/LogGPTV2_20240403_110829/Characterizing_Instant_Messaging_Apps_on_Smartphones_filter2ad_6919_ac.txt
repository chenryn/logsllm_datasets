# Bandwidth and Energy Consumption Analysis of Instant Messaging Apps

## Bandwidth Consumption Analysis

### Background Receiving State
- **Figure 7(a)**: Bandwidth consumption per character for the BRON (Background Receiving On) state.
  - The number of substrings is plotted on the x-axis, and the bandwidth consumption in bits is plotted on the y-axis.
  - The apps analyzed include WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, and Viber.
  - The trend shows that the bandwidth consumption follows a similar pattern but is slightly lower compared to the ICR (In Conversation Receiving) state due to the absence of typing and read notifications.

- **Figure 7(b)**: Bandwidth consumption per character for the BROFF (Background Receiving Off) state.
  - The number of substrings is plotted on the x-axis, and the bandwidth consumption in bits is plotted on the y-axis.
  - The apps analyzed include WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, and Viber.
  - On average, the BRON and BROFF states consume 9.6% and 8.5% more bandwidth than the ICR state, respectively.

## Idle State Analysis

### Energy and Bandwidth Consumption
- **Figure 8(a)**: Energy consumption of idle states.
  - The screen state (on or off) is plotted on the x-axis, and the energy consumption in Joules is plotted on the y-axis.
  - The main function of the idle listening states is to periodically communicate with the server to maintain online presence.
  - The results show that the "keep online" function is relatively energy-efficient. For example, with a 1,500 mAh battery, the FB Messenger in BION (Background Idle On) state can have 172 hours of standby time.

- **Figure 8(b)**: Bandwidth consumption of idle states.
  - The screen state (on or off) is plotted on the x-axis, and the bandwidth consumption in Kbits is plotted on the y-axis.
  - The frequency and number of "keep online" packets are the main factors affecting energy consumption.

## Key Findings
1. **Energy Efficiency in Background Receiving States**:
   - The energy efficiency of different IM apps in background receiving states depends largely on how the app notifies the user about incoming messages.
   - Apps using pop-up window notifications consume significantly more energy than those using banner notifications or icon labels.
   - Simplifying the user notification process can improve energy efficiency.

2. **Improved Methods for Maintaining Online Presence**:
   - With modern IM protocols like XMPP, the energy and bandwidth efficiency of idle states are better compared to other states.
   - Improved methods for maintaining "online presence" have led to higher energy and bandwidth efficiency in idle states.

## Related Work
### Traditional Messaging Services
- Limited prior work has characterized the performance of IM apps on smartphones.
- Studies on PC-based IM apps (e.g., AIM and MSN) focused on network traffic characteristics [16].
- Research on users' conversation styles in the workplace using AT&T's cellular network [9].

### App Profiling
- Multiple research works have developed methods to profile smartphone apps, including:
  - ProfileDroid [15]: A multi-layer profiling tool.
  - ARO [12]: Application Resource Optimizer.
  - eprof [11]: An energy measurement tool.
  - APIX [18]: A third-party API resource usage measurement tool.
- Our focus is on understanding the network and energy characteristics specific to IM apps.

### Mobile IM Apps
- Studies have modeled user residence time and message arrival rates on IM apps [3,4], deriving energy consumption models.
- Techniques to reduce energy consumption, such as message bundling, have been proposed [13].
- Our work aims to quantify the energy and bandwidth consumption of popular IM apps, aligning with efforts to improve their efficiency.

## Conclusions
- By decomposing the operations of IM apps into six states, we characterized their energy and bandwidth efficiency.
- Various operations, such as typing notifications, read notifications, and sending/receiving messages, were analyzed.
- There is significant room for improvement in the "in conversation" and "background receiving" states.
- However, the background idle states already exhibit high energy and bandwidth efficiency.
