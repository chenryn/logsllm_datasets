(a) Energy Consumption of Idle States
(b) Bandwidth Consumption of Idle
States
Fig. 8. The statistics of idle states
Comparing Figs. 4(b) and 7, we can observe that the bandwidth consumption
of the background receiving follows the same trend but is slightly lower than the
bandwidth consumption of the ICR state, since there are no typing notiﬁcations
and read notiﬁcations. On average, the BRON and the BROFF states consume
9.6 % and 8.5 % more bandwidth than the ICR state.
The statistics of the idle listening states are shown in Fig. 8. The main
function of the idle listening states is to communicate periodically with the
94
L. Zhang et al.
server to maintain the online presence. Therefore the number and the frequency
of exchanging “keep online” packets are the main factor aﬀecting the energy
consumption. From the results, we can observe the implementation of the “keep
online” function is comparatively more energy eﬃcient. For example, considering
the 1,500 mAh battery of Nexus S, the FB Messenger in BION state can have
172 h of standby time.
Findings: (1) Energy eﬃciency of diﬀerent IM apps in background receiving
states depends mostly on how the app notiﬁes the user about incoming message.
Apps that use pop-up window notiﬁcation consume drastically more energy than
the apps using banner notiﬁcation or icon label. This sheds light on the potential
to improve energy eﬃciency by simplifying the user notiﬁcation process. (2) With
improved methods of maintaining “online presence” in today’s IM protocols such
as XMPP, the energy and bandwidth eﬃciency of idle states are comparatively
better than other states.
5 Related Work
Traditional Messaging Services: There is a limited amount of prior work on
characterizing the performance of IM apps on smartphones. PC-based IM apps
(AIM and MSN) were characterized in [16] where authors studied network traﬃc
related characteristics. Similarly, [9] characterized the users’ conversation styles
of IM apps in workplace, by analyzing the SMS messages exchanged through
AT&T’s cellular network. Note that diﬀerent from both these eﬀorts, we have
attempted to characterize smartphone IM apps which have revolutionized the
way people connect in today’s era.
App Proﬁling: There has been multiple research works on developing methods
to proﬁle smartphone apps in general. This includes multi-layer proﬁling tool
ProﬁleDroid [15], Application Resource Optimizer (ARO) [12], energy measure-
ment tool eprof presented in [11] and third-party API resource usage measure-
ment tool API Extractor (APIX) presented in [18]. Diﬀerent from these generic
proﬁling tools, our focus in this work is to understand the network and energy
characteristics speciﬁc to the IM apps.
Mobile IM Apps: Considering the research speciﬁc to mobile IM apps, [3,4]
modeled user’s residence time on IM apps and typical message arrival rate. Based
on these models, they derived energy consumption models of IM apps. The pro-
vided model, however, only provides a high-level coarse-grained behavioral analy-
sis which is independent of the operation of the underlying IM app. In this paper,
our focus is on the operations of diﬀerent IM apps. In other related work [13],
the authors showed the energy consumption of IM apps can be reduced by mes-
sage bundling. To evaluate their bundling algorithms, the authors implemented
a customized IM app and developed a software tool Energy Box to estimate
the energy consumption of sending/receiving instant messages by analyzing the
tcpdump traces. Note that such techniques to improve energy eﬃciency of IM
apps are in line with our eﬀort to quantify the energy consumption of popular
IM apps.

6 Conclusions
By decomposing the operations of IM apps into 6 states, we characterized the
energy and the bandwidth eﬃciency of IM apps. We also analyzed various opera-
tions of the IM apps, e.g. typing notiﬁcation, read notiﬁcation, sending/receiving
messages. Our analysis revealed there is still plenty of improvements necessary in
the IM apps especially in the “in conversation” and the “background receiving”
states to improve their energy and bandwidth eﬃciency. However, we observe
that the background idle states already have comparatively high energy and
bandwidth eﬃciency.
