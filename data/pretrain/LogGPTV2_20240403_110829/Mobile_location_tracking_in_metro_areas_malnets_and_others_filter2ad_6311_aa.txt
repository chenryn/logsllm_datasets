ABSTRACT
Digital wireless radios broadcast identiﬁcation numbers that
uniquely identify them. As has been previously observed,
given the ubiquity with which people carry smartphones
with their embedded WiFi radios powered on, comes the
ability to track individuals’ movements. The ability to use
wireless radios for positioning has been previously observed
and developed in to useful products.
In these systems a
user willingly geolocates themselves by providing identiﬁers
to infrastructure hardware. In this paper we consider the
converse question: what rates of monitoring by smartphones
devices in a given metropolitan area are necessary to achieve
diﬀerent levels of involuntary geolocation. While previous
work has looked at countermeasure that attempt to maintain
privacy, no work has attempted to quantify the problem and
risks. Using appropriate simulations we give the ﬁrst quan-
titative support for the number and conditions of tracking
devices necessary to track the locations of non-participant
individuals in urban environments. We provide evidence
that a small, but not insigniﬁcant, number of mobile devices
can be used to track a majority of users during a signiﬁcant
fraction of their travel with current devices. We conclude
that in the immediate future, malnets would require rela-
tively high infection rates to pose a signiﬁcant threat, but
that voluntary networks, with perceived beneﬁt can prob-
ably achieve the usage rates necessary to track individual
movements of non-subscribed users to a high-degree of ac-
curacy. Our results also suggest ubiquitous deployment of
802.11n in smartphones would make geolocation feasible by
malnets.

INTRODUCTION
Location privacy has long been a topic of interest among
information security researchers. Recently it has become a
topic of speciﬁc concern [18, 27, 45]. This is largely due to
the proliferation of GPS devices, web location services, and
the geolocation of network addresses. The ability to locate
a wireless device for beneﬁcial reasons has been looked at by
general computer scientists as well [8,46,58]. These research
projects considered either a static, geolocated set of nodes
that broadcast their existence, or an area that had been
radio-mapped. We consider the question of wide-scale —
potentially involuntary— tracking of individuals in dense
metropolitan areas by a small and mobile sub-population
working in collusion to monitor others’ locations.

We show that wireless location tracking is conceivable in a
modern metropolitan area as the prevalence of WiFi enabled

smartphones increases.
[51, 52] whose purpose
that there will exist mobile malnets
is to geolocate speciﬁc individuals. Work has already been
done on the dynamics for self spreading router and cellphone
malware as well as its potential [28, 52, 55]. Recently we
have seen the ﬁrst spread of worm based malware on jail-
broken iPhones. Thus the potential of such malnets is clear.
The question we address is in determining how eﬀective they
could be at positioning an individual given diﬀerent detec-
tor levels in the population. More legitimate scenarios are
the use of a locating system by location based advertisement
networks, theft locators, or Amber Alert services. Users who
have opted in to such services, perhaps for some ﬁnancial or
karmic incentive, would monitor the positions of users not
in the service. The widespread epidemic of the Gator spy-
ware/advertising network suggests that such unscrupulous
behavior could present itself in a corporate advertising set-
ting.
In the case of an Amber Alert service, users might
sign-up out of altruistic reasons: to help locate missing chil-
dren by searching for carried electronic toys with embedded
WiFi such as PSPs and Zunes. A theft recovery network
might search for stolen goods with WiFi devices incorpo-
rated, for a potential ﬁnders fee. In such a case, users would

iad of potential groups have incentives to try and geolocate
individuals for positive or questionable reasons.
There have been papers discussing the potential of 802.11
and Bluetooth tracking and location privacy [6, 8, 13, 29].
Similarly, there have been papers that have proposed coun-
termeasures to protect against privacy loss due to WiFi iden-
tiﬁer broadcasts [21, 31]. Our paper is the ﬁrst to attempt
to speciﬁcally quantify the degree to which WiFi Identiﬁer
leakage presents a potential threat due to malnets or crowd-
sourcing applications, versus a mere novelty of being able to
position individuals on odd occasions, when users happen
to pass by a detector.
It diﬀerentiates itself by providing
these contributions: 1) We provide strong evidence that a
small percentage of oblivious detectors in an average pop-
ulation of a dense metropolitan area can track a majority
of users a signiﬁcant fraction of the time. 2) We quantify
the degree to which diﬀerent variables, such as population
density, detection rate and broadcast radius aﬀect tracking.
3) We show that small changes in the broadcast radius of
wireless signals have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the ability to
track individuals. Thus, when 802.11n overtakes 802.11g
(As predicted in [47]), the tracking capacity will increase
at a small cost of accuracy. In particular, we ﬁnd malnet
tracking is likely infeasible with current systems, but when
802.11n overtakes 802.11g, geolocating malnets become fea-
sible in dense metropolitan areas.

WiFi devices. Section 3 describes our simulation methodol-
ogy. Section 4 provides our results. Section 5 discusses the
need for simulation. Section 6 discusses the construction of
tracking networks. Section 7 discusses previous mitigating

conclusions in Section 9.
2. OVERVIEW & MOTIVATION
Nearly the entire population of the industrialized world
now carries cell-phones. Worldwide, 68.2 out of 100 in-
habitants have mobile phone subscriptions, up from 12 in
2000 [3]. Similarly, smartphone usage is rising according to
Nielsen [44] which predicts that smartphones will amount to
49% of the cellphone market by Q3 of 2011. With this evolu-
tion and adoption of mobile technology come new potential
risks: Smartphones are much more susceptible to having
homogeneous operating systems—due to their complexity—
than traditional cellphones, and thus to wide scale attack.
By market share, four operating system families (Android,
RIM, Windows and iPhone) had 91% of the smartphone
market in 2010 [33].
Since, smartphones, routers, tablets, netbooks and lap-
tops have access to a number of sensors that traditional PCs
do not, it permits the use of these sensors for new types of
attacks with such malnets, or to provide crowd-sourced sen-
sor applications.
Consider the following scenario. Alice has no malicious
software on her phone, but she has her WiFi radio on for

ronment throughout the day, with the phone broadcasting
its unique WiFi radio identiﬁer. Concurrently, Eve controls
a malnet of smartphones, and she wants to geolocate Alice.
Eve, has previously established—through some means—the
unique identiﬁer of Alice’s radio, and sends a request to all
of the bots: on detection of Alice’s device to report back
the time and location. Based on the information that is
returned, Eve triangulates Alice’s position over time.
In this scenario, the ability for Eve of determine Alice’s
position at any given time depends on three factors: i) the
coverage of infected devices with respect to the route Alice
is taking over time;
ii) the broadcast diameter of Alice’s
wireless radios; and iii) the frequency with which Alice’s
device broadcasts its identity.
Eve’s ability to track targets is made easier by common
behaviors of smartphones and their users. In many phones
(e.g., the iPhone and Android phones), the WiFi is enabled
while the phone is powered on and user active (i.e., not in
a power-saving mode). Many phones will turn oﬀ the WiFi
after a given period of inactive time to save battery life.
However, despite this, some users ﬁnd it preferable to have
the WiFi constantly on, as is evidenced by applications such
. As battery life is
as the insomnia application for iPhone
extended in phones, we can expect more users to have WiFi
that is always on. We discuss phone use more in Sec. 3.

The always-on nature of WiFi means that unless the users
consciously decide to turn oﬀ the WiFi, which many non-
technical users will not, they can be tracked whenever their
phone is active. Note that WiFi radios constantly send out
probe frames even when not connected to a network. Thus
the smartphone need not have an active WiFi connection to
be detected.
The devices in the malnet work as triangulators. Smart-
phones determine their location based on internal GPS sys-
tems or other geolocating services they have access to; APs
and other WiFi enabled devices’ positions are determined
through the use of online database reporting schemes, such
. Once the location of the detecting device is
as Skyhook
known, simple trilateration algorithms suﬃce to position the
device to diﬀerent degrees of conﬁdence. The number of
distinct observations, and information correlated with radio
signal strength can be used to further improve positional
accuracy by the malnet [7, 8].

While we believe the example of the mobile malnet is a
particularly motivating example, there are many other po-
tential uses of such networks (as previously alluded to), so
we will refer to them as tracking networks.
Determining a User’s BSSID.
In some scenarios we consider, such as an Amber Alert
or theft recovery network, a WiFi device’s BSSID (a.k.a..
MAC) address will be given to the tacking network by in-
dividuals who have previously collected them. In other sce-
narios, such as malnets and ad networks, the BSSID will
have to be discovered. We believe that determination of an
individual’s BSSID is not, on average, a diﬃcult problem,
and there are many ways in which it can be uncovered. It
is, after all, given away to every device one connects to,
and broadcast freely. A tracker could ﬁnd a device’s BSSID

86in a number of ways. First, if the tracker can determine
the target’s work or home, they can ask any detector nodes
in either area to collect information about anyone travel-
ing within range and then compare the information to ﬁnd
common and frequently visiting device identiﬁers. In many
cases simple data-ﬁltering could uniquely ﬁnger the identi-
ﬁer in question. Second, if a tracker controlled a diverse
number of APs, they could attempt to trick a user into con-
necting to one. Some third-party AP ﬁrmwares have the
ability to create multiple wireless interfaces. If the tracker
modiﬁed the access point and created an interface to mimic
a common hotspot or an AP the target accesses frequently,
the target could easily be tricked into unknowingly and au-
tomatically connecting to the duplicated AP interface, re-
vealing its BSSID.
An ad network might be unconcerned about matching
a particular BSSID to an individual, but rather be happy
to keep proﬁles on all BSSIDs histories. Alternately, an
ad network wanting to match BSSIDs to individuals would
not have to resort to access point trickery, but rather could
team up with a hot spot provider such as Boingo, T-Mobile,
or AT&T, and request the information of customers who
connect to the hotspots.
In essence, they would willingly
purchase BSSIDs that had been associated with individuals
from organizations that could easily make the association,
due to the nature of their services.
3. METHODOLOGY
Our overall methodology for simulating geolocation using
a tracking network follows the following high-level structure:
1. Simulate an appropriate number of traces, T , of in-
dividuals’ geolocations as they move through a small
subsection (indoors and outdoors) of the downtown
core of a metropolitan city, during a given time pe-
riod.
times of one second.
2. Choose a set S ⊂ T of locators.
3. Choose a set T ⊆ T \ S of tracked individuals.
4. Simulate the traces over a given time period, transition
5. At each time period, for each x ∈ T record each y ∈ S
6. For each maximal set {y} ⊆ S that observes x in a
given time period, use a trilateration to minimize the
area within which x is expected to be.
7. Determine the frequency with which each tracked indi-
vidual x ∈ T is observed and to what area of accuracy
(in m2
that is within transmission diameter d.
) his or her position is learnt.
In Step 1 the simulation is done in three dimensions using
the UDelModels simulator (See Sec. 5.2 for details). In Step
2, a certain fraction of the population is chosen to act as lo-
cators. In the case of a tracking malnet this is the number
of infected individuals.
In the case of user-installed soft-
ware, it represents the individuals who installed positioning
software.
In Step 5, given the location of all individuals
being tracked in set T , we determine if any of them are
within a close proximity to any of the phones or routers
acting as locators in set S. Due to absorption, refraction,
diﬀraction and reﬂection of radio-waves, which depends both
on a number of ﬁxed and intermittent features (e.g., geog-
raphy and landmarks; or weather, traﬃc, and radio inter-
ference, respectively), we cannot accurately determine ex-
