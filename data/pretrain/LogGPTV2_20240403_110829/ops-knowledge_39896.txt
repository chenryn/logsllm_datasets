User: I've just installed Python2.6 on CentOS 5. I have to type python26 to run it. If I type  python I get the default Python 2.4. 
Now I need to build a package using python2.6, but it fails because it can't find python-devel. I know python-devel is installed for Python 2.4. How do I install python-devel (or other packages) specifically for Python 2.6?
EDIT
I know on WebFaction they have easy_install2.6 to do this type of thing.
Assistant: python-devel won't help you, since it will only be available for 2.4. You will need to install the package from source with the appropriate version of Python, e.g. python2.6 setup.py install.
