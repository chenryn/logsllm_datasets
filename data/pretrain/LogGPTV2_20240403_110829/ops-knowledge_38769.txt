User: How to configure a network security group to restrict the ingress and egress traffic of cloud platform instances?
Assistant: To configure a network security group to restrict the ingress and egress traffic of a cloud platform instance, follow the steps below: 1. Log in to the console of the cloud platform you are using, and find the network security group function module. 2. Create a new network security group, specify the desired name, description, and VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) where it resides. 3. On the configuration page of the network security group, add ingress and egress rules to restrict the source and destination of traffic. Different rules can be set for different protocols and ports as required, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc. 4. Bind the security group to the instance that needs to be restricted. In the cloud platform console, find the corresponding instance, select Network Settings, then configure the network security group, and select the previously created security group. 5. Check whether the configuration takes effect. In the VPC where the instance is located, try to connect to the instance from the restricted IP address or port, or initiate a connection request from the instance to the restricted IP address or port, and check whether it is restricted. Through these steps, you can configure the network security group to restrict the ingress and egress traffic of the cloud platform instance, thereby strengthening network security.
