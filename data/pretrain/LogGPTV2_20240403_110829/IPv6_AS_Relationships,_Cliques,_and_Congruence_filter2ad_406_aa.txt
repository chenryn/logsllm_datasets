Abstract. There is increasing evidence that IPv6 deployment is matur-
ing as a response to the exhaustion of unallocated IPv4 address blocks,
leading to gradual convergence of the IPv4 and IPv6 topologies in terms
of structure and routing paths. However, the lack of a fully-connected
transit-free clique in IPv6, as well as a diﬀerent economic evolution than
IPv4, implies that existing IPv4 AS relationship algorithms will not accu-
rately infer relationships between autonomous systems in IPv6, encum-
bering our ability to model and understand IPv6 AS topology evolution.
We modify CAIDA’s IPv4 relationship inference algorithm to accurately
infer IPv6 relationships using publicly available BGP data. We validate
24.9 % of our 41,589 c2p and p2p inferences for July 2014 to have a
99.3 % and 94.5 % PPV, respectively. Using these inferred relationships,
we analyze the BGP-observed IPv4 and IPv6 AS topologies, and ﬁnd
that ASes are converging toward the same relationship types in IPv4
and IPv6, but disparities remain due to diﬀerences in the transit-free
clique and the inﬂuence of Hurricane Electric in IPv6.
1 Introduction
Depletion of the unallocated IPv4 address pool increases the pressure for wide-
spread adoption of IPv6. IPv6 deployment has long been characterized as largely
experimental, dominated by research and education networks [7,16]. However,
recent studies suggest that the IPv6 network is maturing, reﬂected in increas-
ing similarity of the IPv6 and IPv4 networks in terms of topological structure,
routing dynamics and AS path congruity [9]. Czyz et al. also found the IPv6
traﬃc mix (set of applications using IPv6) in 2013 much more similar to the
IPv4 traﬃc mix than in the past [8].
Despite these signals of convergence, noticeable diﬀerences remain between
IPv4 and IPv6 routing relationships. In August 2010, Giotsas et al. found dis-
parity in IPv4 and IPv6 AS relationships as inferred from BGP communities
and local preference values [13]. Dhamdhere et al. showed that while 40–50% of
dual-stacked paths observed in public BGP data were identical in 2012, if the
ASes followed the same routing policies in IPv4 and IPv6, then 60–70% of paths
could have been congruent [9]. They also found signiﬁcant deviation between
the most prominent ASes (those that appeared most frequently in AS paths) in
IPv4 and IPv6, with the most prominent AS in the IPv6 topology (Hurricane
Electric) appearing in a much larger fraction of IPv6 AS paths than the most
prominent AS in the IPv4 topology (Level 3) appeared in IPv4 AS paths.

Because IPv6 deployment did not build on the existing IPv4 network, the IPv6
topology evolved in parallel, and not all assumptions relied upon by IPv4 AS rela-
tionship inference algorithms hold in IPv6. Inferring AS relationships is more chal-
lenging in IPv6 than in IPv4 for two reasons. First, given its still low deployment
and diﬀerent economics compared to IPv4 [9], IPv6 business policies are less rigor-
ously enforced, leading to more policy violations [14] which impede the accuracy
of relationship inference heuristics. Second, the IPv6 graph is not fully connected
due to peering disputes between large transit-free providers [17,23]. These chal-
lenges have discouraged both research [21] and commercial [22] eﬀorts from infer-
ring IPv6 AS relationships.
We make the following contributions. First, we adapt our IPv4 AS rela-
tionship algorithm [18] to accurately infer IPv6 AS relationships by accounting
for IPv6-speciﬁc realities: in particular, the IPv6 AS topology is still not fully
connected due to peering disputes [17]. We use our algorithm to infer AS rela-
tionships for January 2004 to July 2014 and publicly release our inferences. Sec-
ond, we evaluate our algorithm’s accuracy by validating 10,357 (24.9 %) of our
41,589 inferences using three sources of validation data, and ﬁnd our provider-
customer and peer-peer inferences have a 99.3 % and 94.5 % positive predictive
value (PPV), respectively, in July 2014. We publicly release our validation data,
which we derive quarterly between 2004 and 2014. Finally, we use our inferences
to understand the growing congruity between IPv4 and IPv6 AS topologies. We
show that despite growing congruity between the graphs, IPv6 AS relationships
have evolved diﬀerently from those in IPv4. Disparate dual stack relationships
are decreasing, from 15 % in January 2006 to 5 % in 2014, consistent with previ-
ous ﬁndings of growing similarity between IPv4 and IPv6 [8,9]. However, Hur-
ricane Electric (HE) is the main contributor of disparate relationships, and over
50 % of their dual stack relationships diﬀered between IPv4 and IPv6 in July
2014.
2 Background on Inferring as Relationships
AS relationships are often abstracted into three conventional classes [10]. In
a provider-customer (p2c) relationship, a customer AS buys transit from a
better connected AS to expand its reachability. In a peer-peer (p2p) relation-
ship, two ASes provide access to their own and their customers’ networks. In a
sibling-sibling (s2s) relationship, two ASes under common ownership may pro-
vide mutual transit to each other. ASes that can reach every network in the
routing system without purchasing transit are known as Tier-1 ASes. Tier-1
ASes maintain p2p links between each other to ensure their global reachability,
forming a clique that serves as the backbone of inter-domain routing. AS rela-
tionships translate into BGP routing policies that determine the economics of
traﬃc exchange [11]. Accurate knowledge of AS relationships is thus essential to
understanding not only inter-domain routing but also Internet economics [18].
Unfortunately, AS relationships are often treated as proprietary by ISPs and
controlled by non-disclosure agreements, leading researchers to build algorithms

that heuristically infer AS relationships using publicly available BGP routing
data. We recently developed an algorithm for inferring IPv4 AS relationships;
we validated 34.6 % of 126,082 p2c and p2p inferences for April 2012 to have
a 99.6 % and 98.7 % PPV, respectively [18]. Our approach began by inferring
a Tier-1 clique, applied heuristics to infer p2c links based primarily on how
neighbors were observed to export routes, and inferred the remainder to be p2p.
Section 4 describes how we modiﬁed this algorithm to infer AS relationships in
the IPv6 topology graph.
Our IPv6 AS relationship algorithm infers conventional p2c and p2p relation-
ships and does not infer complex AS relationships by design. We have developed
and validated an algorithm to infer hybrid and partial transit relationships in
IPv4 [12]. That algorithm uses conventional AS relationship inferences as input,
and it is possible to apply the same heuristics to the output of our conventional
IPv6 algorithm to infer complex IPv6 AS relationships.
3 Data
3.1 BGP Paths
We extracted AS paths from every vantage point providing BGP data to Route
Views (RV) [4] and RIPE RIS [3] by downloading one RIB ﬁle per day between
the 1st and 5th of every month between January 2004 and August 2014 and
extracting AS paths that announced reachability to IPv6 preﬁxes.
3.2 Validation Data
For validation, we used three sources of IPv6 AS relationship data: BGP commu-
nities, RPSLng, and local preference (LocPref). We had access to BGP commu-
nity data every month, quarterly RPSLng dumps, and three LocPref collections.

BGP communities are an optional transitive attribute that operators use
to annotate routes [6]. The meaning of communities values are not standard-
ized and each operator deﬁnes their own community values and meanings. We
compiled a dictionary of community values and corresponding meanings that
encode relationship types by mining WHOIS records and websites where oper-
ators document their speciﬁc use of community values; we also used historical
documentation of communities values in archived WHOIS records and the Way-
back web archive service [15] to obtain a dictionary for each April from 2004 to
2014. We assembled monthly validation datasets by applying the dictionary to
corresponding public BGP data; the composition of this set of validation data
over time is summarized in Fig. 1. For April 2014, our dictionary included 1,560
communities values deﬁned by 284 ASes, and we used the dictionary to obtain
validation data for 7,514 IPv6 links for the July 2014 IPv6 AS topology.
RPSLng is the Routing Policy Speciﬁcation Language next generation [5],
which network operators can use to store routing policies in public databases.
The largest source of such data is RIPE’s WHOIS database; many European
IXPs require operators to register routing policies with RIPE NCC. An import
rule speciﬁes which route announcements to accept from neighbors, and an
export rule speciﬁes what routes to advertise to neighbors. The special rule
ANY is used to import/export all routes from/to a neighbor, and indicates a
customer/provider relationship. Using RIPE’s WHOIS database from July 2014,
we extracted 739 c2p relationships with the following method: if X has a rule
that imports ANY from Y, and Y has a rule that exports ANY to X, we infer X
is a customer of Y. Because RIPE NCC no longer provides the changed dates in
their WHOIS dumps, we were unable to ﬁlter by freshness and used all records.
Despite the many links in our communities and RPSLng datasets, they
include less than 2 % of the IPv6 links observed in public BGP data for Hur-
ricane Electric (HE), the most prominent AS in the IPv6 graph [9]. To extend
our validation dataset to include HE’s relationships we use the local preference
(LocPref) attribute, which does not directly encode relationship information
but often reﬂects it [11]. LocPref is a number that expresses the level of pref-
erence an AS gives a route if multiple routes are available for the same preﬁx.
LocPref values are also non-standardized, but many ASes assign the highest
value to their customers and the lowest to their providers, which maximizes
transit revenue. We collected LocPref values for HE’s neighbors by querying
its public route server in July 2014, and we used two older datasets from [13].
Figure 2 summarizes the collected LocPref values for HE’s IPv6 neighbors; with
few exceptions (22/2325 neighbors, marked with red crosses) HE assigns a sin-
gle LocPref value to all preﬁxes received by each neighbor. Where HE assigned
multiple values for diﬀerent preﬁxes received from the same neighbor, we chose
the value assigned to the most preﬁxes, since altering LocPref values is not
typical behavior. When comparing HE’s LocPref values in IPv4 to inferred IPv4
relationships, we found a consistent mapping between LocPref 140 and HE’s cus-
tomers (2591/2593) and LocPref 100 and HE’s peers (601/603). This mapping
is HE-speciﬁc and not valid for every AS.
