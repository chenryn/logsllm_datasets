Abstract—User-generated content sites routinely block contri-
butions from users of privacy-enhancing proxies like Tor because
of a perception that proxies are a source of vandalism, spam,
and abuse. Although these blocks might be effective, collateral
damage in the form of unrealized valuable contributions from
anonymity seekers is invisible. One of the largest and most
important user-generated content sites, Wikipedia, has attempted
to block contributions from Tor users since as early as 2005.
We demonstrate that these blocks have been imperfect and
that thousands of attempts to edit on Wikipedia through Tor
have been successful. We draw upon several data sources and
analytical techniques to measure and describe the history of Tor
editing on Wikipedia over time and to compare contributions
from Tor users to those from other groups of Wikipedia users.
Our analysis suggests that although Tor users who slip through
Wikipedia’s ban contribute content that is more likely to be
reverted and to revert others, their contributions are otherwise
similar in quality to those from other unregistered participants
and to the initial contributions of registered users.
I. INTRODUCTION
When a Wikipedia reader using the Tor Browser notices a
stylistic error or missing fact and clicks the “Edit” button to
ﬁx it, they see a message like the one reproduced in Fig. 1.
Wikipedia informs would-be Tor contributors that they, like
others using open proxy systems to protect their privacy, have
been preemptively blocked from contributing. Wikipedia is not
alone in the decision to block participation from anonymity-
seeking users. Although service providers vary in their ap-
proaches, users of privacy-enhancing technologies are unable
to participate in a broad range of online experiences [21].
In this work, we attempt to measure the value of contribu-
tions made by the privacy-seeking community and compare
these contributions to those by other users. We focus on the
users of a single service, Wikipedia, and a single privacy-
protecting technology, Tor, to understand what is lost when a
user-generated content site systematically blocks contributions
from users of privacy-enhancing technologies.
Fig. 1. Screenshot of the page a user is shown when they attempt to edit the
Wikipedia article on “Privacy” while using Tor.
In particular, we make use of the fact that Wikipedia’s
mechanism of blocking Tor users has been imperfect
to
identify and extract 11,363 edits made by Tor users to English
Wikipedia between 2007 and 2018. We analyze how some
Tor users managed to slip through Wikipedia’s block and
describe how we constructed our dataset of Tor edits. We use
this dataset to compare the edits of people using Tor (Tor
editors) with three different control sets of time-matched edits
by other Wikipedia contributor populations: (1) non-logged
in users editing from non-Tor IP addresses whose edits are
credited to their IP address (IP editors), (2) people logged
into accounts making their ﬁrst edit (First-time editors), and
(3) people logged into accounts with more than one edit using
the same account (Registered editors).
Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative tech-
niques, we ﬁnd that while Tor editors are more likely to
revert someone’s work and to be reverted, other indicators of
quality suggest that their contributions are similar to those of
IP editors and First-time editors. In an exploratory analysis,
we ﬁt topic models to Wikipedia articles and ﬁnd intriguing
differences between the kinds of topics that Tor users and other

Wikipedia editors contribute to. We conclude with a discussion
of how user-generated sites like Wikipedia might accept contri-
butions from the millions of daily users of privacy-enhancing
technologies like Tor1 in ways that beneﬁt both the websites
and society.
II. RELATED WORK
Most people seek out anonymity online at some time or
another [12]. Their reasons for doing so range from seeking
help and support [1], exploring or disclosing one’s identity
[2, 18, 36], protecting themselves when contributing to online
projects [14], seeking information, pursuing hobbies, and
engaging in activities that may violate copyright such as ﬁle
sharing [20].
Anonymity can confer important beneﬁts, not just for the
individual seeking anonymity but also for the collective good
of online communities [20, 31]. The use of anonymity in col-
laborative learning has been demonstrated to improve equity,
participation rates, and creative thinking [7]. Research suggests
that anonymity can support self-expression and self-discovery
among young people [13]. For instance, researchers found
that anonymity helps users discuss topics that are stigmatized
[1, 8].
Despite the range of legitimate reasons that people adopt
anonymity to interact on the Internet and the beneﬁts to col-
laborative communities, many websites systematically block
trafﬁc coming from anonymity-seeking users of systems like
Tor.2 According to Khattak et al., at least 1.3 million IP
addresses blocked Tor at the TCP/IP level as of 2015, and
“3.67% of the top 1,000 Alexa sites are blocking people using
computers running known Tor exit-node IP addresses” [21].
Of course, websites do not block anonymity tools like Tor
for no reason. Research has shown that online anonymity is
sometimes associated with toxic behaviors that are hard to
control [23]. Trafﬁc analysis of Tor in 2010 found a substantial
portion of network activity is associated with peer-to-peer
applications such as BitTorrent [5]. Another report made by
Sqreen,3 an application protection service, claims that “a
user coming from Tor is between six and eight times more
likely to perform an attack” on their website, such as path
scanning and SQL/NoSQL injection. Tor exit node operators
often receive complaints of “copyright infringement, reported
hacking attempts, IRC bot network controls, and web page
defacements” [27]. The most frequent complaints about Tor
users’ negative behavior are DCMA violations, which made up
99.74% of the approximately three million email complaints
sent to exit operators from Torservers.net from June, 2010 to
April, 2016 [33].
A third perspective suggests that anonymity seeking behav-
ior is neither “good” nor “bad” and that anonymous users

are best understood as largely similar to other users. Studies
of anonymous behaviors on Quora have found that answers
from anonymous contributors are no worse than answers given
by registered users and the only signiﬁcant difference is that
“with anonymous answers, social appreciation correlated with
the answer’s length” [25]. Furthermore, Mani et al.’s study
of the domains visited by Tor users showed that 80% of the
websites visited by Tor users are in the Alexa top one million,
giving further evidence that Tor users are similar to the overall
Internet population [24].
Although the tradeoffs between anonymity’s beneﬁts and
threats have been investigated and discussed from many per-
spectives, the question of what value anonymous contributions
might bring to contexts where they are disallowed is difﬁcult
to answer. How does one estimate the value of something that
is not happening? By examining the relatively small number of
Tor edits that slipped through Wikipedia’s restriction between
2007–2018, we hope to begin doing just that. In the next
sections, we explain the context of our data collection and
analysis as well as the methods we used to identify a dataset
of Wikipedia edits from Tor.
III. EMPIRICAL CONTEXT
A. Tor
The Tor network consists of volunteer-run servers that allow
users to connect to the Internet without revealing their IP
address. Rather than users making a direct connection to a
destination website, Tor routes trafﬁc through a series of relays
that conceal the origin and route of a user’s Internet trafﬁc.
Within Tor, each relay only knows the immediate sender and
the next receiver of the data but not the complete path that the
data packet will take. The destination receives only the ﬁnal
relay in the route (called the “exit node”), not the Tor user’s
original IP address. The list of all Tor nodes is published so
that Tor clients can pick relays for their circuits. This public
list also allows the public to determine whether or not a given
IP address is a Tor exit node at a given point in time. Some
websites, including Wikipedia, use these lists of exit nodes to
restrict trafﬁc from the Tor network.
B. Wikipedia
As one of the largest peer production websites, Wikipedia
receives vast numbers of contributions every day. While
Wikipedia is available in many languages, English Wikipedia
is the largest edition with the most articles, active users,
and viewers.4 As of February 2019, the English language
Wikipedia “develops at a rate of 1.8 edits per second” with
more than 136,000 registered editors who contribute each
month.5 When these registered editors change something, their
username is credited with that edit. Wikipedia also allows
people to contribute without asking them to sign up or log

in. In these cases, the contributor’s IP address is credited with
the change.
Wikipedia’s low barriers to participation have subjected the
website to vandalism and poor-quality editing. In Wikipedia,
vandalism refers to the deliberate degradation of an article
either by removing part of the existing work or adding
damaging content. Erasing the full text of articles and adding
profanity or racial slurs are common forms of vandalism.
The Wikipedia community invests enormous resources into
minimizing and mitigating vandalism. Using a combination
of bots and humans, the Wikipedia community has developed
banning mechanisms to mitigate repeated attempts from indi-
viduals who repeatedly sabotage the community’s work. For
example, if someone is detected vandalizing an article, their
account’s privilege to edit on Wikipedia might be halted and
the IP address of their device might be banned from editing
in the future. Of course, this does not stop more tech-savvy
saboteurs from using methods to change their online identities
and continuing to cause damage [15].
Skepticism about anonymity-seeking users has been evident
from the early years of Wikipedia. In messages from the
the archives of Wikipedia’s public mailing lists from 2002
and 2004, Wikipedia’s founder Jimmy Wales argued that
users without accounts should be treated differently and that
anonymous users represented a problem for Wikipedia.6 In
2005, English Wikipedia blocked anonymous users from cre-
ating pages.7 Between 2008 and 2013, there was an extended
discussion in the Wikipedia community about how to most
effectively block contributions by Tor users.8
Conversations in Wikipedia about allowing anonymity-
seeking contributors have rarely discussed the beneﬁts that
may ﬂow from allowing them. Recent qualitative research has
shown that open-content production sites like Wikipedia value
certain forms of anonymous contributions because they can
lower barriers to participation but rarely consider other reasons
that someone might want to be participate anonymously [28].
Other work has illuminated the reasons that people want to
participate anonymously [14] and the kinds of good-faith con-
tributions they make [6]. This work highlights the differences
between service providers’ perceptions of what anonymity is
good for and what contributors think. As part of this conver-
sation, some Wikipedia users have voiced their concern that
the blocking of Tor was not justiﬁed and suggested that there
had been “no quantitative information about the frequency and
size of [problems created by Tor users].” Although Wikipedia
contributors have occasionally discussed lifting the site’s ban
on Tor in the mailing lists9 and the “Wikipedia talk: Blocking

IV. TOR EDITS TO WIKIPEDIA
A. Identifying Tor edits
Edits to Wikipedia made from Tor are attributed to an
IP address and appear just
like contributions from other
unregistered editors. To identify edits as coming from Tor,
we ﬁrst used a complete history database dump of the English
Wikipedia and obtained metadata of all revisions made on
Wikipedia up to March 1, 2018.11 This metadata included
revision ID, revision date, editor’s username or IP address,
article ID or title, and article “namespace” (a piece of metadata
used to categorize types of pages on Wikipedia).
The Tor metrics site maintains the list of exit nodes run
by volunteers.12 As the name suggests, the exit list consists
of “known exits and corresponding exit IP addresses available
in a speciﬁc format.” Exit list data goes back to February
22, 2010 and is updated and archived every hour. Each
archive has details of exit nodes available at the time the list
was produced. Most websites that restrict access from Tor,
including Wikipedia, have relied on this list.
When we consulted with the Tor metrics team, we were
told that this information is not 100% complete. Before a
node is picked to be an exit node, the Tor network uses
dedicated servers to determine whether or not it meets the
requirements necessary to function as part of the Tor network.
These dedicated servers are called directory authorities, and
