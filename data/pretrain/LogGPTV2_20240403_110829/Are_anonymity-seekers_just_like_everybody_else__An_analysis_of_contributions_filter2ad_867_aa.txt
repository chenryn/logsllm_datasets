## Abstract
User-generated content sites often block contributions from users of privacy-enhancing proxies like Tor due to the perception that these proxies are sources of vandalism, spam, and abuse. While such blocks may be effective, they also prevent valuable contributions from anonymity-seekers. Since 2005, Wikipedia has attempted to block contributions from Tor users. Our study demonstrates that these blocks have not been entirely successful, and thousands of edits from Tor users have been made. Using multiple data sources and analytical techniques, we examine the history of Tor editing on Wikipedia and compare the contributions of Tor users to those of other groups. Our analysis suggests that while Tor users' contributions are more likely to be reverted and to revert others, their overall quality is similar to that of unregistered contributors and the initial contributions of registered users.

## I. Introduction
When a Wikipedia reader using the Tor Browser encounters a stylistic error or missing fact and clicks the "Edit" button, they are greeted with a message informing them that their contributions are blocked due to the use of an open proxy system. This practice is not unique to Wikipedia; many online services restrict participation from anonymity-seeking users. In this work, we aim to measure the value of contributions made by privacy-seeking users, focusing on Wikipedia and Tor, to understand what is lost when user-generated content sites systematically block such contributions.

## II. Related Work
Many individuals seek online anonymity for various reasons, including seeking help, exploring identity, protecting themselves, and engaging in activities that may violate copyright. Anonymity can provide significant benefits, such as improving equity and participation in collaborative learning and supporting self-expression among young people. However, many websites block traffic from anonymity-seeking users, particularly those using systems like Tor. Research indicates that online anonymity is sometimes associated with toxic behaviors, but studies also show that anonymous users are largely similar to other users. For example, anonymous contributions on Quora are no worse than those from registered users, and the domains visited by Tor users are similar to those visited by the general Internet population.

## III. Empirical Context

### A. Tor
The Tor network consists of volunteer-run servers that allow users to connect to the Internet without revealing their IP address. Traffic is routed through a series of relays, concealing the origin and route of the user's Internet traffic. The destination website only receives the final relay (exit node) and not the user's original IP address. Some websites, including Wikipedia, use lists of Tor exit nodes to restrict traffic from the Tor network.

### B. Wikipedia
Wikipedia is one of the largest peer production websites, receiving vast numbers of contributions daily. The English edition is the largest, with over 136,000 registered editors contributing each month. Wikipedia allows both registered and unregistered users to contribute, with unregistered users' contributions credited to their IP addresses. Vandalism and poor-quality editing are common issues, and the community invests significant resources in mitigating these problems. Skepticism about anonymity-seeking users has been evident since the early years of Wikipedia, leading to the blocking of anonymous page creation in 2005 and extended discussions about blocking Tor users between 2008 and 2013.

## IV. Tor Edits to Wikipedia

### A. Identifying Tor Edits
To identify edits made from Tor, we used a complete history database dump of the English Wikipedia, which includes metadata for all revisions up to March 1, 2018. We cross-referenced this data with the list of Tor exit nodes maintained by the Tor metrics site. Although this list is not 100% complete, it is widely used by websites, including Wikipedia, to block Tor traffic. We identified 11,363 edits made by Tor users to English Wikipedia between 2007 and 2018.

## V. Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that while Tor users' contributions are more likely to be reverted and to revert others, their overall quality is similar to that of unregistered contributors and the initial contributions of registered users. We conclude with a discussion on how user-generated content sites like Wikipedia might accept contributions from privacy-seeking users in ways that benefit both the websites and society.
