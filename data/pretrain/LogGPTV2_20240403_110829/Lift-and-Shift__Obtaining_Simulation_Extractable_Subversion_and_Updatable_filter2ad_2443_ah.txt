It appears that the provided text is a mix of symbols, letters, and fragments of cryptographic protocol descriptions. I will attempt to reconstruct and optimize the main content, focusing on the sections that seem to be discussing the Lamassu updatable SNARKs framework and related cryptographic concepts.

### The SE Updatable SNARKs from Lamassu

#### Key Generation
- **KGencrs(R, auxR)**:
  - \((\text{crs}\Pi, \text{tc}\Pi, \zeta\Pi) \leftarrow \Pi.\text{KGen}(R, \text{auxR})\)
  - \((\text{csk}, \text{cpk}, \zeta\text{cpk}) \leftarrow \Sigma.\text{KGen}(1^\lambda)\)
  - \(\text{crs} := (\text{crs}\Pi, \text{cpk})\), \(\text{tc} := (\text{tc}\Pi, \text{csk})\), \(\zeta := (\zeta\Pi, \zeta\text{cpk})\)
  - Return \((\text{crs}, \text{tc}, \zeta)\).

#### CRS Update
- **Ucrs(crs, \(\{\zeta_i\}_{i=1}^n\))**:
  - \((\text{crs}\Pi, \text{up}, \zeta\Pi, \text{up}) \leftarrow \Pi.\text{Ucrs}(1^\lambda, \text{crs}\Pi, \{\zeta\Pi,i\}_{i=1}^n)\)
  - \((\text{cpk}\text{up}, \zeta\text{cpk}, \text{up}) \leftarrow \Sigma.\text{Ucrs}(\text{cpk}, \{\zeta\text{cpk},i\}_{i=1}^n)\)
  - Return \((\text{crs}\text{up} = (\text{crs}\Pi, \text{up}, \text{cpk}\text{up}), \zeta\text{up} = (\zeta\Pi, \text{up}, \zeta\text{cpk}, \text{up}))\)

#### CRS Verification
- **Vcrs(crs, \(\{\zeta_i\}_{i=1}^n\))**:
  - If \(\text{Vcrs}\Pi(1^\lambda, \text{crs}\Pi, \{\zeta\Pi,i\}_{i=1}^n) = 1\) and \(\Sigma.\text{Vpk}(\text{pk}, \text{cpk}, \{\zeta\text{cpk},i\}_{i=1}^n) = 1\), return 1; else return 0.

#### Proof Generation
- **P(crsup, x, w)**:
  - \((\text{sk}, \text{pk}) \leftarrow \Sigma.\text{KGen}(1^\lambda)\)
  - \((\text{skOT}, \text{pkOT}) \leftarrow \Sigma_{\text{OT}}.\text{KGen}(1^\lambda)\)
  - \(\pi\Pi \leftarrow \Pi.\text{P}(\text{crsup}, x, (w, \perp), \perp)\)
  - \(\sigma \leftarrow \Sigma.\text{Sign}(\text{sk}, \text{pkOT})\)
  - \(\sigma\text{OT} \leftarrow \Sigma_{\text{OT}}.\text{Sign}(\text{skOT}, \pi\Pi || x || \text{pk} || \sigma)\)
  - Return \(\pi := (\pi\Pi, \text{pk}, \sigma, \text{pkOT}, \sigma\text{OT})\).

#### Proof Verification
- **V(crsup, x, \(\pi\))**:
  - Parse \(\pi\) as \((\pi\Pi, \text{pk}, \sigma, \text{pkOT}, \sigma\text{OT})\)
  - If \(\Pi.\text{V}(\text{crsup}, x, \pi\Pi) = 0 \lor \Sigma.\text{Verify}(\text{pk}, \text{pkOT}, \sigma) = 0 \lor \Sigma_{\text{OT}}.\text{Verify}(\text{pkOT}, \pi\Pi || x || \text{pk} || \sigma, \sigma\text{OT}) = 0\), return 0; else return 1.

#### Simulation
- **Sim(crsup, x, tc)**:
  - \((\text{sk}, \text{pk}) \leftarrow \Sigma.\text{KGen}(1^\lambda)\)
  - \((\text{skOT}, \text{pkOT}) \leftarrow \Sigma_{\text{OT}}.\text{KGen}(1^\lambda)\)
  - \(\pi\text{Sim} \leftarrow \Pi.\text{Sim}(\text{crsup}, x, (\perp, \text{tc}\Pi), \perp)\)
  - \(\sigma \leftarrow \Sigma.\text{Sign}(\text{sk}, \text{pkOT})\)
  - \(\sigma\text{OT} \leftarrow \Sigma_{\text{OT}}.\text{Sign}(\text{skOT}, \pi\text{Sim} || x || \text{pk} || \sigma)\)
  - Return \(\pi := (\pi\Pi, \text{pk}, \sigma, \text{pkOT}, \sigma\text{OT})\).

### Performance and Security Analysis

The Lamassu compiler extends the relation with a proof of the statement \(\text{cpk} = \text{pk} \cdot \mu(\text{csk} - \text{sk})\) with the witness \(\text{csk} - \text{sk}\). For Schnorr signatures, the public key is a group element of the form \(g^{\text{sk}}\), and \(\mu\) maps scalars to the corresponding group element, i.e., \(\mu(x) = g^x\). This extension requires 1008 constraints, which is comparable to other frameworks but with additional features like updatability.

#### Bandwidth Overhead

- **CRS Extension**: The CRS is extended with a public key \(\text{cpk}\) of the signature scheme \(\Sigma\). For Schnorr, this is a point on the Jubjub curve, requiring 510 bits (256 bits with point compression).
- **Proof Size**: Each proof includes a \(\Sigma\) public key and signature, as well as a \(\Sigma_{\text{OT}}\) public key and signature. The total size increase is 2032 bits.
- **Updatable Version**: Similar to the non-updatable version, but Schnorr is performed in \(G_1\) with an additional public key and update in \(G_2\).

### Comparison with Other Frameworks

- **OC∅C∅**: The CRS grows by 256 bits, and each proof grows by 1016 bits.
- **Lamassu**: The CRS is extended with a public key, and each proof is increased by 2032 bits.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we revisited the lifting technique of the C∅C∅ framework to obtain SE SNARKs. By refining the construction and selecting well-suited SNARK-friendly primitives, we obtained an improved version (OC∅C∅), which outperforms the original construction in both the number of constraints and proof size. We then presented an alternative generic framework, Lamassu, which lifts SNARKs to SE SNARKs and preserves subversion resistance and updatability. Lamassu represents the first known framework to generically obtain SE updatable SNARKs and compares favorably to OC∅C∅.
