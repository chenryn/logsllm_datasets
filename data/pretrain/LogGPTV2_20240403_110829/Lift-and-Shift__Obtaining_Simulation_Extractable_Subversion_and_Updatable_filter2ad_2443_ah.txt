part of the relation can be expressed with 756 constraints, whereas the latter
can be expressed with 252 constraints, so a total of 1008 constraints [HBHW19,
Section A.4]. For the Lamassu compiler, we extend the relation with a proof
of the statement cpk = pk · µ(csk − sk) with the witness csk − sk. For Schnorr
signatures (cf. Appendix A.6), but also other DLOG-based signature schemes
such as ECDSA, the public key is a group element of the form gsk and simi-
larly, µ simply maps scalars to the corresponding group element, i.e., µ(x) = gx.
Hence, the circuit for this relation also requires 1008 constraints. Compared to
the OC∅C∅ framework instantiations (cf. Table 1), Lamassu needs only 200 con-
26
straints more than the most aggressive choice using Poseidon and beats all others
in the number of constraints. Considering that Schnorr and ECDSA signatures
are well established primitives, and that the conﬁdence in their security is far
bigger than all the recent SNARK/STARK-friendly primitives, this additional
conﬁdence and the updatability feature come at a very small cost for the prover.
In terms of bandwidth overhead, we only need to compare the overhead in-
duced by cpk = pk·µ(csk−sk) together with the signature and one-time signature
in Lamassu, and µ = fs0(pks) ∧ ρ = fs0 (β0) and the one-time signature in the
case of OC∅C∅. For Lamassu, the CRS is extended with a public key cpk of
signature scheme Σ, i.e., when using Schnorr a point on the Jubjub curve which
requires 510 bits (256 bits with point compression). For each proof, new Σ and
ΣOT keys are sampled. The proof then includes a Σ public key and signature,
as well as ΣOT public key and signature. The former amounts to 256 bits for the
public key and 504 bits for the signature (2 integers modulo the group order),
and the latter – when instantiated as Groth’s sOTS over Jubjub (or a curve of
similar size) – amounts to 768 bits for the public key (3 group elements) and 504
bits for the signature (2 integers modulo the group order). In total, the size of
the proof is increased by 2032 bits. The updatable version is similar, but Schnorr
is performed in G1 with additional public key and update in G2.
For C∅C∅, the CRS is extended with a SHA256 commitment. The proofs are
extended with a freshly generated ΣOT public key and a signature together with
the evaluation of a PRF also instantiated with SHA256. Hence, the CRS grows
by 256 bits and each proof grows by 1016 bits (with Schnorr over Jubjub). For
our version, OC∅C∅, the CRS is extended with ρ and β, both 256 bits each. Each
proof additionally contains µ and a fresh ΣOT public key and signature. Using
Groth’s sOTS, the proof grows by 1528 bits.
In Table 2 we present a comparison of SE-SNARKs including OC∅C∅ using
Groth’s OTS, OC∅C∅[G], and Schnorr, OC∅C∅[S], Lamassu using Schnorr, La-
massu[S,S], Groth’s OTS, Lamassu[S,G], and Boneh-Boyen signatures [BB04],
Lamassu[S,BB], both as non-updatable and updatable variant. The overhead is
relative to the underlying SNARK (for the generic constructions) or the SNARK
they are based on, e.g., relative to [Gro16]. In the table, n denotes the number
of multiplication gates in the circuit, G1 and G2 the two source groups of a bi-
linear group, G a group with prime order q, and λ the sizes of commitments and
PRF evaluations. For concrete numbers, we followed the above choice of curves,
namely Jubjub (G) and BLS12-381 as a bilinear group (q, G1, G2, GT , e, g, ˆg),
respectively. For commitments and PRFs, we assume 256 bit outputs. For the
veriﬁer overhead, we consider the most expensive operations. EG denotes an ex-
ponentiation in G and P a pairing evaluation (with P a factor 10 slower than
EG).
(O)C∅C∅, and Lamassu oﬀer a trade-oﬀ between the size of CRS and proofs,
and veriﬁer overhead when comparing to the ad-hoc constructions. The veriﬁer
overhead is smaller than the ones for Groth-Maller [GM17], Bowe-Gabizon [BG18]
and Lipmaa [Lip19] and is comparable to those of Atappoor-Baghery [AB19] and
Baghery [Bag19], yet Lamassu oﬀers more features.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we revisited the lifting technique of the C∅C∅ framework to obtain
SE SNARKs. By reﬁning the construction and selecting well-suited SNARK-
friendly primitives, we obtained an improved version (OC∅C∅), which outper-
forms the original construction in both number of constraints as well as proof
size signiﬁcantly.
We then presented an alternative generic framework, dubbed Lamassu, that
lifts SNARKs to SE SNARKs and also preserves subversion resistance and up-
datability of the underlying SNARK. In particular, Lamassu represents the
ﬁrst known framework to generically obtain SE updatable SNARKs and actu-
ally yields the ﬁrst known SE updatable SNARK. It requires only signatures
with certain key-homomorphic properties or updatable signatures, a novel prim-
itive introduced in this paper, for SE updatable SNARKs. Moreover, Lamassu
compares favorably to OC∅C∅.
