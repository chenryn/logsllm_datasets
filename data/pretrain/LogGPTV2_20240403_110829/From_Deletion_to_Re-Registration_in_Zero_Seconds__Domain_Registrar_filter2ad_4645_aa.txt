## Abstract
When desirable Internet domain names expire, they are often re-registered immediately after deletion in a highly competitive and resource-intensive practice known as domain drop-catching. Despite its significance, there has been limited insight into the daily time period when expired domain names are deleted and the subsequent race for re-registration. In this paper, we demonstrate that .com domains are deleted in a predictable order and propose a model to infer the earliest possible time a domain could be re-registered. Leveraging this model, we characterize the re-registration process with a precision of seconds. Our findings indicate that 9.5% of deleted domains are re-registered with zero-second delay. Domains not immediately re-registered by drop-catch services are often re-registered later, exhibiting different behaviors over the following seconds, minutes, and hours. These differences in behavior imply varying levels of effort and cost, making our methodology useful for future studies on the uses of re-registered domains.

## 1 Introduction
The re-registration of expired Internet domain names is highly competitive. Drop-catchers, who attempt to re-register a domain the instant it is deleted, consume a significant share of resources in the domain registration ecosystem. In prior work, we showed that three large drop-catch services control 75% of all domain registrar accreditations and are responsible for at least 80% of domain creation attempts, even though the vast majority of their attempts fail. No more than 9.5% of new .com domains are created by drop-catch services [10].

Due to a lack of metadata with better time resolution, we previously approximated drop-catch domains as those re-registered on the deletion date [10]. However, as we illustrate in this work, the truly competitive re-registration period lasts only about one hour. Consequently, our prior work could not distinguish between true drop-catch domains and others re-registered many hours later with less competition and normal resource consumption. For instance, some actors engage in "home-grown" drop-catching using desktop software and domain reseller APIs [5, 14] to avoid the fees of traditional drop-catch services, which can be two to ten times more expensive than a regular domain registration. This difference in price may influence the future uses of re-registered domains, with pricier drop-catch domains potentially being less likely to be used for malicious purposes than delayed re-registrations.

In this paper, we improve the precision of drop-catch research [10, 13, 17] to a time scale of seconds, rather than days. We show that .com domains become available in a predictable order and develop a model to infer the earliest time a domain could have been re-registered. Using this model, we provide a more detailed picture of the competitive landscape. We calculate domain re-registration delays with respect to the earliest possible instant and classify re-registration behavior according to the order of magnitude of this delay. We find that drop-catch accounts for approximately 86.1% of domains re-registered on the deletion day. This means that the approximation from prior work based on the date alone misclassifies 13.9% of domains, which are in fact delayed re-registrations with different domain and registrar characteristics and costs. Our methodology for distinguishing re-registration types can be useful for future studies exploring the registration intent and uses of domains.

Our work makes the following contributions:
- We provide the first detailed look at .com domain deletion and re-registration times at a precision of seconds, as opposed to the daily aggregates used in prior work.
- We infer and present the first model of the earliest possible re-registration time of .com domains on their deletion day.
- We characterize re-registrations based on the delay from the earliest possible instant and show that there are qualitative differences in domain attributes and registrar behavior.

## 2 Background & Related Work
Domain names must be assigned to a registrant or domain owner before they can be used on the Internet. In each zone (under a top-level domain), domain registrations are recorded by a central registry, such as Verisign for .com domains. Typically, customers cannot access the registry system directly; accredited registrars or resellers manage the domain registration on behalf of the customer.

Domain names are registered for a limited time and must be renewed regularly to remain active. When registrants do not renew their domain, the registration expires and, after proceeding through several stages [11], the domain will eventually be deleted. The current state of a domain can be observed through the Whois protocol or its designated successor, the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP, RFC 7493 [4]). Available information includes the time the domain was registered, when the information was last updated, the identifier of the sponsoring registrar, and (often obfuscated) contact data of the registrant.

Once a domain has been deleted, it can be re-registered by any interested party on a first-come, first-served basis. In the .com zone, between 66,000 and 112,000 domains are deleted each day, as shown in Figure 1. Some of these domains may be valuable, leading prospective registrants to race to be the first to "catch" a "dropping" domain.

The exact time an expired domain is deleted depends on several factors. At a macro level, we showed in prior work [11] that a variable number of days elapse after a domain's expiration date before the domain is deleted, due to differences in how registrars manage domains. At a micro level, we studied domain re-registrations on the same day the prior registration is deleted [10]. For .org and .biz domains, we found that the majority of same-day re-registrations occurred during a one-to-five-minute interval beginning at the same time each day. This interval is known as the Drop. Due to a lack of timestamps in Whois data at the time of that study, we were not able to conduct the same type of analysis for the far more popular (and competitive) .com domains.

Verisign does not publicly disclose details about how .com domains are made available for re-registration on the deletion day. From anecdotal reports by participants in the ecosystem [6, 7, 9, 16], we infer the following likely characteristics: The Drop starts every day at 2 pm Eastern Time and lasts for around one hour, depending on how many domains are scheduled for deletion. Domain deletions are spread out over the duration of the Drop and occur in a predictable order [1, 16], although the method of creating this order is not publicly known.

Drop-catch services allow customers to backorder domains that are about to be deleted and compete with each other to re-register domains the instant they become available. To do so, drop-catch services send large quantities of speculative domain registration requests to the registry. In prior work, we found that registrars associated with drop-catch services have domain creation success ratios as low as 0.05%, whereas regular registrars may exhibit success rates above 99%. To submit more requests, some drop-catch services maintain large numbers of registrar accreditations. Three large drop-catch services together control 75% of registrars, worth millions of dollars in accreditation fees [10]. A key element in allocating these resources efficiently is to precisely predict the time when a domain will become available. Therefore, it is likely that drop-catch services possess proprietary models of domain deletion times during the Drop.

Domain backorder fees from drop-catch services can be two to ten times more expensive than regular domain registrations. To avoid these fees, prospective registrants can attempt to re-register domains on their own. It may seem difficult to compete with the resources and expertise of drop-catch services, but only around 10% of deleted domains are re-registered on the deletion day [10]. This leaves a large number of domains that can be re-registered at a lower cost. Software tools such as DropKing [5] cater to the niche market of "homegrown" drop-catching, utilizing reseller APIs of domain registrars for automation purposes.

In related work, domain name re-registrations have been discussed as potential [15, 18] or actual [8, 12] attacks. Salvador and Nogueira [17], and Miramirkhani et al. [13] studied how registrants select domains to re-register. Miramirkhani et al. found that shorter length, higher age, more traffic, and prior maliciousness all resulted in a higher re-registration probability. Furthermore, fewer than 11% of re-registered domains hosted content, while the remainder was re-registered for speculative or malicious purposes.

## 3 Data Collection
In this paper, we aim to characterize registrar behavior during the Drop and assess whether deleted domains are re-registered as early as possible. Unlike prior work [10, 13], we measure at a time scale of seconds instead of days. The measurement is based on knowledge of the date when a domain is deleted, metadata about the prior registration, and the time when the domain is re-registered.

Conceptually, our data collection methodology is similar to prior work [10], but we simplify it by using more robust data sources.

### Pending Delete Lists
To promote registrations, Verisign’s DomainScope [2] service publishes lists of domains that are scheduled to be deleted within the next five days. Since this service is offered by the .com and .net registry, we assume that the pending delete list is authoritative. We downloaded the list each day for a duration of eight weeks in early 2018; Figure 1 shows the date range and number of domains on the lists.

### Domain Status
Three days before the scheduled deletion date of a domain, we requested the metadata of the expired registration. Since our last study, Verisign increased the precision of registration, update, and expiration dates to timestamps. We collected these timestamps and used them to infer the earliest possible re-registration time.
