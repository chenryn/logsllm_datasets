majority of their attempts fail and no more than 9.5 % of new .com
domains are created by drop-catch services [10].
ABSTRACT
When desirable Internet domain names expire, they are often re-
registered in the very moment the old registration is deleted, in a
highly competitive and resource-intensive practice called domain
drop-catching. To date, there has been little insight into the daily
time period when expired domain names are deleted, and the race
to re-registration that takes place. In this paper, we show that .com
domains are deleted in a predictable order, and propose a model
to infer the earliest possible time a domain could have been re-
registered. We leverage this model to characterise at a precision of
seconds how fast certain types of domain names are re-registered.
We show that 9.5 % of deleted domains are re-registered with a delay
of zero seconds. Domains not taken immediately by the drop-catch
services are often re-registered later, with different behaviours over
the following seconds, minutes and hours. Since these behaviours
imply different effort and price points, our methodology can be
useful for future work to explain the uses of re-registered domains.

1 INTRODUCTION
Re-registration of expired Internet domain names can be quite com-
petitive. Drop-catchers, who attempt to re-register a domain in the
same instant the expired registration is deleted, consume a consid-
erable share of resources of the domain registration ecosystem. In
prior work, we showed that three large drop-catch services control
75 % of all domain registrar accreditations and are responsible for

Due to a lack of metadata with a better time resolution, we pre-
viously approximated drop-catch domains as all those re-registered
on the deletion date [10]. However, as we illustrate in this work, the
truly competitive re-registration period lasts only about one hour.
Consequently, our prior work could not distinguish between true
drop-catch domains, and others re-registered many hours later with
less competition and normal resource consumption. For instance,
there is evidence that some actors engage in “home-grown” drop-
catching using desktop software and domain reseller APIs [5, 14]
to avoid the fees of traditional drop-catch services, which can be
two to ten times more expensive than a regular domain registra-
tion. This difference in price may have an influence on future uses
of re-registered domains. For example, one may suspect that the
pricier drop-catch domains are less likely to be used for malicious
purposes than delayed re-registrations.
In this paper, we improve the precision of drop-catch research [10,
13, 17] to a time scale of seconds, instead of days. We show that
.com domains become available in a predictable order, and develop
a model to infer the earliest time a domain could have been re-
registered. Using this model, we paint a more detailed picture of
the competitive landscape. We calculate domain re-registration
delays with respect to the earliest possible instant, and classify
re-registration behaviour according to the order of magnitude of
this delay. We show that there exist qualitative differences in the
domains re-registered, and in the domain registrars active within
each of these delay periods. For example, we find that drop-catch
accounts for approximately 86.1 % of domains re-registered on the
deletion day. This means that the approximation from prior work
based on the date alone misclassifies 13.9 % of domains, which are
in fact delayed re-registrations with different domain and registrar
characteristics, and a different cost. Our methodology for distin-
guishing re-registration types can be useful for future studies that
explore the registration intent and uses of domains.
Our work makes the following contributions:
• We provide the first detailed look at .com domain deletion
and re-registration times at a precision of seconds, as op-
posed to the daily aggregates used in prior work.
• We infer and present the first model of the earliest possible
re-registration time of .com domains on their deletion day.
• We characterise re-registrations based on the delay from the
earliest possible instant, and show that there are qualitative
differences in domain attributes and registrar behaviour.

2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK
Domain names need to be assigned to a registrant or domain owner
before they can be used on the Internet. In each zone (under a
top-level domain), domain registrations are recorded by a central
registry, such as Verisign for .com domains. Typically, customers
cannot access the registry system directly. Accredited registrars or
resellers manage the domain registration on behalf of the customer.
Domain names are registered for a limited time and must be re-
newed regularly in order to remain active. When registrants do not
renew their domain, the registration expires and after proceeding
through a number of stages [11], the domain will eventually be
deleted. The current state of a domain can be observed through
the Whois protocol or its designated successor, the Registration
Data Access Protocol (RDAP, RFC 7493 [4]). Available information
includes the time the domain was registered, when the information
was last updated, the identifier of the sponsoring registrar, as well
as (often obfuscated) contact data of the registrant.
Once a domain has been deleted, it can be re-registered by any
interested party on a first-come, first served basis. In the .com zone,
between 66 k and 112 k domains are deleted each day, as shown in
Figure 1. Some of these domains may be valuable, thus prospective
registrants race to be the first to “catch” a “dropping” domain.
When exactly an expired domain is deleted depends on a number
of factors. At a macro level, we showed in prior work [11] that a
variable number of days elapse after a domain’s expiration date
before the domain is deleted, which is due to differences in how
registrars manage domains. At a micro level, we studied domain re-
registrations on the same day the prior registration is deleted [10].
For .org and .biz domains, we found that the majority of same-
day re-registrations occurred during a one to five-minute interval
beginning at the same time each day. This interval is known as the
Drop. Due to a lack of timestamps in Whois data at the time of that
study, we were not able to conduct the same type of analysis for
the far more popular (and competitive) .com domains.
Verisign does not publicly disclose details about how .com do-
mains are made available for re-registration on the deletion day.
From a number of anecdotal reports by participants of the ecosys-
tem [6, 7, 9, 16], we infer the following likely characteristics: The
Drop starts every day at 2 pm Eastern Time and lasts for around one
hour, depending on how many domains are scheduled for deletion.
Domain deletions are spread out in time over the duration of the
Drop. They occur in a predictable order [1, 16], but to the best of
our knowledge, how the order is created is not publicly known.
Drop-catch services allow customers to backorder domains that
are about to be deleted, and compete with each other to re-register
domains in the very instant they become available. To do so, drop-
catch services send large quantities of speculative domain registra-
tion requests to the registry. In prior work, we found that registrars
associated with drop-catch services have domain creation success
ratios as low as 0.05 %, whereas regular registrars may exhibit suc-
cess rates above 99 %. In order to be able to submit more requests,
some drop-catch services maintain large numbers of registrar ac-
creditations. Three large drop-catch services together control 75 %
of registrars, worth millions of dollars in accreditation fees [10]. A
key element to allocating these resources efficiently is to precisely
predict the time when a domain will become available. Therefore,
it is likely that drop-catch services possess proprietary models of
domain deletion times during the Drop.
Domain backorder fees from drop-catch services can be two to
ten times more expensive than regular domain registrations. In
order to avoid these fees, prospective registrants can attempt to
re-register domains on their own. It may appear difficult to compete
with the resources and expertise of drop-catch services, but only
around 10 % of deleted domains are re-registered on the deletion
day [10]. This leaves a large number of domains that can be re-
registered at a lower cost. Software tools such as DropKing [5]
cater to the niche market of “homegrown” drop-catching; they
utilise reseller APIs of domain registrars for automation purposes.
In related work, domain name re-registrations have been dis-
cussed as potential [15, 18] or actual [8, 12] attacks. Salvador and
Nogueira [17], and Miramirkhani et al. [13] studied how registrants
select domains to re-register. Miramirkhani et al. found that shorter
length, higher age, more traffic, and prior maliciousness all resulted
in a higher re-registration probability. Furthermore, fewer than 11 %
of re-registered domains hosted content, while the remainder was
found to be re-registered for speculative or malicious purposes.
3 DATA COLLECTION
In this paper, we aim to characterise registrar behaviour during
the Drop, and assess whether deleted domains are re-registered as
early as possible. In contrast to prior work [10, 13], we measure at a
time scale of seconds instead of days. The measurement is based on
knowledge of the date when a domain is deleted, metadata about the
prior registration, and the time when the domain is re-registered.
Conceptually, our data collection methodology is similar to prior
work [10], which we simplify by using more robust data sources.
Pending Delete Lists: In an effort to promote registrations,
Verisign’s DomainScope [2] service publishes lists of domains that
are scheduled to be deleted within the next five days. Since this
service is offered by the .com and .net registry, we assume that
the pending delete list is authoritative. We downloaded the list each
day for a duration of eight weeks in the beginning of 2018; Figure 1
shows the date range and number of domains on the lists.
Domain Status: Three days before the scheduled deletion date
of a domain, we requested the metadata of the expired registration.
Since our last study, Verisign increased the precision of registration,
update and expiration dates to timestamps. We collected them
