User: So everyday, I need to login to a couple different hosts via ssh and run some maintenance commands there in order for the QA team to be able to test my features.
I want to use a python script to automate such boring tasks. It would be something like:

ssh host1
deploy stuff
logout from host1
ssh host2
restart stuff
logout from host2
ssh host3
check health on stuff
logout from host3
...

It's killing my productivity, and I would like to know if there is something nice, ergonomic and easy to implement that can handle and run commands on ssh sessions programmatically and output a report for me.
Of course I will do the code, I just wanted some suggestions that are not bash scripts (because those are not meant for humans to be read).
Assistant: If these manual stuffs is too many, then I may look into some server configuration managements like Ansible. 
I have done this kinda automation using:

Ansible 
Python Fabric 
Rake
