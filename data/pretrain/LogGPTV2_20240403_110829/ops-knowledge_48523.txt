User: How to setup a Linux/Unix machine for python development? Which Linux/Unix version should I use? What IDE should be used? What development plugins should I have? What code style should would be THE BEST? All above, a great development machine for open source (python developers) development?
Can i ask for screenshot of some great personalized IDE for Python? All platform users are invited. Please, do include the source/plugin/article how you made it. 
Thanks.
Assistant: Install any of the Linux distributions on your computer. If you have a preference, great. If not, try Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian. Any of them is pretty user and developer friendly too. 
IDE, well I don't use one. But you may try NetBeans with Python support or Eclipse (with PyDev).
Code style- well, try and learn to be pythonic. It should come with practice and asking questions

I think that should get you started!
