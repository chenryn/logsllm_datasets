User: When there are a large number of requests accessing the application server at the same time, how to ensure the high availability of the server and improve the system performance through the load balancer?
Assistant: Ensure high server availability and improve system performance through the following measures: 1. Horizontal expansion: For larger application servers, the number of application servers can be increased by horizontal expansion. A load balancer distributes requests among available servers, preventing a server from being overloaded. 2. Health check: The load balancer can perform regular health checks to ensure server availability. If a server is unavailable, the load balancer removes it from the request route. 3. Multi-data center deployment: If the application runs across multiple data centers, a global load balancer can be used to route requests to the nearest available data center, thereby improving system performance and availability. 4. Cache technology: Using cache can reduce server load, reduce request response time, and improve system performance and availability. 5. CDNs: Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to cache application resources globally, improving system performance and availability. CDN can route requests to nodes close to users, thereby reducing network latency. Overall, using a load balancer can improve system performance and availability, making servers more stable and reliable under high load conditions.
