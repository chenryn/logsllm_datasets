hi  
please provide capability of defining css namespace for all css and js that
render html or use classes for example:  
change class name for modal
.modal-header  
to  
.ns-modal-header
for inner example user can define namespace class for widgets in your site:
Customize section
then user can change the ns to unique name to preventing css name conflict
with his css files.
