User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What do shellshock attacks look like in system logs? I have some Linux servers, which from what I can tell are not vulnerable to the shellshock attack vector, but I am curious what the attack looks like in the logs. What does a successful attack look like in the appache2 logs?
What would a successful attack look like in the system log?

What do failed attempts look like? I'd like to extend my black-list for shell-shock type attacks.

Assistant: This is an entry from my access_log of what my coworker did to my test machine... : 

10.11.12.13 - - [25/Sep/2014:16:00:00 -0400] "GET /cgi-bin/testing.cgi HTTP/1.0" 200 1 "-" "() { test;};echo \"Content-type: text/plain\"; echo; echo; /bin/rm -rf /var/www/"    


In my error log I saw a lot of this: 

[Thu Sep 25 16:00:00 2014] [error] [client 10.11.12.13] /bin/rm: cannot remove `/var/www/icons/pie0.png': Permission denied


Bastard :-)

A well configured web-server won't be able to overwrite its logs, and in all but the tiniest environments, you should be using centralized logging to protect you from losing these kinds of log entries.  

If you're successfully exploited, you may see lots of errors in the error_log which show failed attempts to access resources, execute programs or delete files.  If they successfully escalate privileges, and you don't have off-site logging, then you may see no evidence.
