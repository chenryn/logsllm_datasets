# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
This ticket is not critical, since the `dist/production` env still works, but
there seems to be some not needed redundancy.

The map contains the the same chunk-names for many (not all) entries at the
first and last position of the arrays.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
The easiest way to reproduce it:
  1. clone the neo.mjs repository: https://github.com/neomjs/neo
  2. npm install
  3. npm run build-all
  4. open dist/production/appworker.js
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Chunk-names should be unique for each path / array. One easy way to fix it is
probably to convert the array into a Set and back.
it could make sense though to investigate why this is happening
