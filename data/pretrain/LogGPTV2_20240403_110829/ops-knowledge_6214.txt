User: You need to implement a scheduled task to monitor the disk usage of the server every hour, and automatically trigger an alarm notification when the usage exceeds a certain threshold. Please provide a set of disk monitoring and alarm solutions.
Assistant: The scheme is as follows: 1. Use the Cron timer or the scheduled task function that comes with the system to execute a shell script every hour. The script includes the following steps: 2. Use the df -h command to obtain the disk usage of the server, and store the result in a in the file. 3. Read the result file in the previous step, analyze the disk usage, and judge whether the disk usage exceeds the preset threshold. 4. If the disk usage exceeds the preset threshold, an alarm notification is triggered, and the administrator can be notified by sending an email, a text message or a log for processing. 5. Save the log of the execution process to a file for later viewing. 6. In terms of security, it is necessary to control the permissions of Shell scripts to ensure that only authorized personnel can execute and modify the scripts. 7. An exception handling mechanism needs to be added to the script to notify the administrator or record the log in time when an execution error occurs. 8. Before performing alarm notification, you need to consider a variety of situations to avoid false positives and negative negatives, such as the disk usage rate is 0 and so on. In addition, if you need more comprehensive monitoring, you can consider using professional monitoring software for monitoring, such as Nagios, Zabbix and other monitoring software, which can monitor multiple aspects of the system and provide customized alarm mechanisms.
