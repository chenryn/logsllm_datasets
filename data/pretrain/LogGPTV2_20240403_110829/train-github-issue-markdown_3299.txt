    Creating minion configuration
    ./../cluster/aws/../../cluster/../cluster/aws/coreos/util.sh: line 32: $1: unbound variable
And when I'm looking at
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/aws/util.sh#L945
it looks like it don't sends any arguments.
I'm on mac os x, the config I use is
    export KUBE_AWS_ZONE=eu-west-1a
    export AWS_S3_REGION=eu-west-1
    export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
    export MASTER_SIZE=c4.large
    export MINION_SIZE=r3.large
    export KUBE_OS_DISTRIBUTION=coreos
    export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws
