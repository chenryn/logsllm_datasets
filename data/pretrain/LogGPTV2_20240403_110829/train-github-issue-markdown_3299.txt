Hello,

I encountered an issue while attempting to run `kube-up.sh` with AWS and CoreOS. The output I received is as follows:

```
Attempt 1 to check for SSH to master [ssh to master not working yet]
Attempt 2 to check for SSH to master [ssh to master working]
Attempt 1 to check for salt-master [salt-master not working yet]
Attempt 2 to check for salt-master [salt-master not working yet]

Attempt 7 to check for salt-master [salt-master not working yet]
Attempt 8 to check for salt-master [salt-master running]
Creating minion configuration
./../cluster/aws/../../cluster/../cluster/aws/coreos/util.sh: line 32: $1: unbound variable
```

Upon reviewing the script at the following location:
[https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/aws/util.sh#L945](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/aws/util.sh#L945)

It appears that the script does not pass any arguments, which may be causing the "unbound variable" error.

My environment and configuration are as follows:
- Operating System: macOS X
- Configuration settings:
  - `export KUBE_AWS_ZONE=eu-west-1a`
  - `export AWS_S3_REGION=eu-west-1`
  - `export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1`
  - `export MASTER_SIZE=c4.large`
  - `export MINION_SIZE=r3.large`
  - `export KUBE_OS_DISTRIBUTION=coreos`
  - `export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws`

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue? 

Thank you.
