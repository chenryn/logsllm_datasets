Abstract. In this paper, we analyze a large amount of infection data for
three major botnets: Conﬁcker, MegaD, and Srizbi. These botnets rep-
resent two distinct types of botnets in terms of the methods they use to
recruit new victims. We propose the use of cross-analysis between these
diﬀerent types of botnets as well as between botnets of the same type in
order to gain insights into the nature of their infection. In this analysis,
we examine commonly-infected networks which appear to be extremely
prone to malware infection. We provide an in-depth passive and active
measurement study to have a ﬁne-grained view of the similarities and
diﬀerences for the two infection types. Based on our cross-analysis re-
sults, we further derive new implications and insights for defense. For
example, we empirically show the promising power of cross-prediction
of new unknown botnet victim networks using historic infection data of
some known botnet that uses the same infection type with more than
80% accuracy.
1 Introduction
Recent botnets use several methods to ﬁnd and infect victims. Among these
methods, most botnets have mainly employed two infection techniques [9] [7]
[6]:
{ Bots automatically propagate themselves (auto-self-propagating, Type I ). To
do this, bots usually employ network scanning techniques to ﬁnd vulnerable
hosts and exploit them. This approach is active and aggressive in infecting
victims. Conﬁcker [3] is a good example of this kind of botnets [9].
{ Bots spread themselves with the help of people or other methods (non-auto-
self-propagating, Type II ). In this case, since bots cannot ﬁnd new victims
automatically, malware writers should employ other techniques. They install
a malicious binary into compromised web sites and trick people into down-
loading it (i.e., drive-by-download [12]) or they ask other malware owners,
who have pre-installed malware, to distribute their malware (i.e., pay-per-
installation (PPI) [17] [28]). This approach seems to be relatively passive
because the operation sequence of this approach may depend on human ac-
tions or other tools. The MegaD [7] and Srizbi [5] botnets, which are known
2

as spam botnets, are representative examples of this type of botnet [7] [17]
[6].
Both auto-self-propagating and non-auto-self-propagating botnets have be-
come serious threats to the Internet. For example, some of them have infected
millions of victims [4] and some are infamous for generating a signiﬁcant amount
of spam emails [8]. Analyzing and understanding them is thus becoming an im-
portant and urgent research task in order to design more eﬀective and eﬃcient
defenses against them.
In this paper, we start our research with a simple yet important question:
are there any similarities/diﬀerences in infection patterns (e.g., the distribution
of victims) between these two types of botnets? We believe the answer to this
question can greatly deepen our understanding of the nature of these botnets
and enable us to develop more accurate/targeted Internet malware monitor-
ing, detection, prediction techniques, strategies and systems. Since both types
of botnets have quite diﬀerent infection approaches, i.e., auto- and non-auto-
self-propagating, we could predict that their infection patterns are likely also
diﬀerent. To understand whether this hypothesis is right or wrong, one needs
to collect and cross-analyze both types of botnets. However, although there are
several previous measurement/analysis studies that have made signiﬁcant eﬀorts
to understand botnet infection characteristics [16] [13] [14] [6], they mainly focus
on only one speciﬁc botnet, rarely providing cross-analysis of diﬀerent (types of)
botnets. This is probably due to many reasons, for example practical diﬃculties
on data collection: (a) collecting a good amount of real-world botnet data is
hard; (b) collecting multiple diﬀerent (types of) real-world botnet data is even
harder.
In this work, we have collected a large amount of real-world botnet infection
data, including millions of Conﬁcker victims and several hundred thousands of
MegaD and Srizbi victims. They cover the two representative infection tech-
niques mentioned before with reasonably large amount of samples and thus are
suitable for our study. We perform an in-depth cross-analysis of diﬀerent botnet
types and show what similarities/diﬀerences exist between them. Slightly con-
tradictory to the hypothesis we made above, we ﬁnd that both types of botnets
have a large portion of victims overlapped and the overall victim distributions
in IPv4 space are quite similar. However, they do show several interesting char-
acteristics diﬀerent from each other. To obtain a ﬁne-grained understanding of
these similarities and diﬀerences, we further perform an in-depth set of large-
scale passive and active measurement studies from several perspectives, such
as IP geographical location, IP address population/density, networks openness
(remote accessibility), and IP address dynamism. Our results reveal many inter-
esting characteristics that could help explain the similarities/diﬀerences between
the two botnet infection types.
Furthermore, from our measurement results, we have further derived new
implications and insights for defense. We found that due to the heavily uneven
distribution of botnet victims, we can observe strong neighborhood correlation
in victims. Although it is intuitive that Type I malware (speciﬁcally scanning
Cross-Analysis of Botnet Victims: New Insights and Implications
3
malware) tends to infect neighbor networks and thus neighborhood watch could
be a useful prediction technique [2], it is unknown whether this applies to the case
of Type II malware. For the ﬁrst time in the literature we show with empirical
evidence that Type II botnet victims also exhibit this similar property. More
interestingly, we have empirically discovered that even if we only know some
information of one botnet (e.g., past botnet data), we could predict unknown
victims of another botnet (e.g., a future emerging botnet) with reasonably high
accuracy, given that both botnets use the same infection type. This sheds light
on the promising power of cross-analysis and cross-prediction.
In short, the contributions of this paper are as follows.
{ We collect a large amount of real-world botnet data and provide the ﬁrst
cross-analysis study between two types of botnet infections to the best of our
knowledge. This kind of study is useful to understand the nature of malware
infection and help us gain insights for more eﬀective and eﬃcient defense.
{ We perform a large-scale passive and active measurement study for a ﬁne-
grained analysis of similarities/diﬀerences in two botnet infection types. We
study several aspects such as IP geolocation, IP address population/density,
IP address dynamism, and network openness (remote accessibility). We have
many interesting ﬁndings. To name a few (incomplete) examples, (a) diﬀerent
countries are likely prone to diﬀerent types of malware infections while some
countries such as Turkey are extremely vulnerable to both infection types; (b)
malware infection seems to have very interesting correlation with geopolitical
locations; (c) IP address dynamism and network openness are likely to cause
more malware infections (for certain type). And they have diﬀerent eﬀect on
diﬀerent types of botnet infections.
{ Based on our cross-analysis result, we further derive new implications and
insights for defense. We perform an empirical test to predict unknown victim
networks of non-auto-self-propagating botnets by looking up their neighbor
information. We further extend it to cross-predict unknown victim networks
of a new botnet using existing knowledge of botnets with the same infection
type and we show that the prediction accuracy can be reasonably high (more
than 80%).
2 Data Collection and Term De(cid:12)nition
In this section, we provide information of data that we have analyzed and we
deﬁne several terms used in this work.
Data Collection To understand the characteristics of diﬀerent types of botnets,
we have collected data for three major botnets: Conﬁcker, MegaD, and Srizbi.
Conﬁcker [3] is a recent popular botnet known to have infected several million
Internet machines. It propagates automatically through network scanning. It ﬁrst
scans random networks to ﬁnd new victims and if it infects a host successfully,
it scans neighbor networks of the host to ﬁnd victims nearby [9]. Thus it is a
4

representative example of Type I botnets. The MegaD [7] and Srizbi [6] botnets
are two recent botnets known for sending large volume of spam since 2008. In
particular, it is mentioned that MegaD was responsible for sending about 32%
of spam worldwide [7] and Srizbi was responsible for sending more than half of
all the spam in 2008 [1]. They are representative examples of Type II botnets
because they spread by drive-by-download [7, 6] or pay-per-install methods [17].
The Conﬁcker botnet data has been collected by setting up sinkholing servers
because Conﬁcker uses domain-ﬂuxing to generate C&C domain names for vic-
tims to contact [3]. With the help of shadowserver.org, we have collected a large
dataset of Conﬁcker infection including about 25 million victims [2]. The shad-
owserver.org has set up several sinkhole servers and registered the domain names
same as the Conﬁcker master servers to redirect queries of the Conﬁcker bots
to the sinkhole servers. Then, the sinkhole servers capture the information of
hosts contacting them and the hosts can be considered as the Conﬁcker infected
victims.

Table 1. Data summary of collected botnets.
The MegaD and Srizbi botnet data has been collected through the botlab
project [19], of which spam trap servers were used to gather information of hosts
sending spam emails. The detailed summary information regarding our collected
data is presented in Table 1. The botlab project captures spam emails from spam-
trap servers and further investigates the spam emails through various methods
such as crawling URLs in the spam emails and DNS monitoring. From corre-
lating the investigation results, the botlab project ﬁnally reports which hosts are
considered as infected by spam-botnets such as MegaD and Srizbi.
Term De(cid:12)nition Before we perform cross-analysis on the data, there are sev-
eral important issues to be addressed which can bias our result. The ﬁrst thing
is the dynamism of the IP address of a host. Many ISPs use dynamic IP address
re-assignment to manage their assigned IP addresses eﬃciently [10]. This makes
it hard to identify each host correctly. This may cause some biases in measuring
the population or characteristics of the botnet [11]. Second, we are not likely
to collect the complete data of certain botnets but only parts of the data (e.g.,
MegaD and Srizbi), and this can also cause some biases.
To account for these issues, instead of basing our analysis unit granularity
on the individual IP address level, we generalize our analysis to examine at the
network/subnet level by grouping adjacent IP addresses. This will help mitigate
Cross-Analysis of Botnet Victims: New Insights and Implications

the eﬀect of dynamism, because it is common that dynamic IP addresses of a host
come from the same address pool (subnet). Also, we believe that it is suﬃcient
to examine subnets because even if only one host in the network is infected, the
neighbor hosts are likely to be vulnerable or be infected soon [2].
In this work, we deﬁne our base unit for analyzing, i.e., “infected network”,
as the /24 subnet which has at least one malware infected host. Thus, if a sub-
network is infected by a Type I botnet, we call the subnet a Type I infected
network and a similar deﬁnition is also applicable to Type II infected networks.
In addition, we deﬁne a Common infected network as an infected network which
has victims of both types of botnets. There may be some infected networks that
are exclusively infected by either Type I or Type II, which are deﬁned as Type I
EX or Type II EX infected networks, respectively.
In our data set, we found 1,339,699 infected networks in the case of the Con-
ﬁcker botnet, 71,896 for the MegaD botnet, and 77,934 for the Srizbi botnet.
Thus, we have data for around 1,339,699 infected networks for the Type I bot-
net and 137,902 infected networks for the Type II botnet1. From this we have
identiﬁed 97,290 Common infected networks.
3 Cross-Analysis of Botnet Victims
In this section, we provide detailed cross-analysis results of two types of botnets.
3.1 Point of Departure
We start our analysis with the following Hypothesis 1 that we proposed in Sec-
tion 2.
Hypothesis 1. Since the two types of botnets have very diﬀerent infection
vectors, they may exhibit diﬀerent infection patterns (e.g., distributions of their
infected networks).
To verify this hypothesis, we measure how many infected networks are shared
by both types of botnets and how they are diﬀerent from each other. The basic
measurement results are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1(a) shows the distribution
for infected networks of each type of botnet over the IP address spaces (Type I
(Conﬁcker), II (MegaD and Srizbi), and Common infected networks). Interest-
ingly, the distributions of Type I and Type II botnets are very similar to each
