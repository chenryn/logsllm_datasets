User: How to monitor and debug the distributed system to ensure the stability and reliability of the system?
Assistant: To monitor and debug a distributed system, the following steps need to be taken: 1. Set appropriate monitoring metrics and thresholds, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network latency, etc. 2. Use appropriate monitoring tools to monitor the system and record the monitoring data in real time. 3. Detect errors and alarms in real time, and issue alarms in time. 4. Use logs to record system status and errors, and use log analysis tools to analyze and detect errors. 5. Conduct performance tests on the system, simulating the actual situation, in order to find potential problems and bottlenecks. 6. Conduct periodic inspections on the system to ensure that the system is running in a stable state. 7. When a problem occurs, take appropriate measures to debug, such as restarting services, resetting the system, etc. 8. Realize automated operation and maintenance, use automated scripts to assist monitoring and debugging, and ensure system stability and reliability. The above are monitoring and debugging methods for distributed systems, aiming to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.
