Question: Why should an application not rely solely on removing dangerous characters like '../' from user input as its mitigation strategy against path traversal vulnerabilities?
"A": "This approach is equivalent to a denylist which might not be comprehensive and could miss certain attack vectors due to encoding issues or alternative traversal sequences.",
"B": "Special characters like '../' are needed for normal application operation and cannot be removed without impacting functionality.",
"C": "Only removing dangerous characters does not enforce strict input validation on length, type, or acceptable values as required.",
"D": "This method will cause the application to be incompatible with non-English file systems that do not use '../' as a traversal sequence."
Answer: A
