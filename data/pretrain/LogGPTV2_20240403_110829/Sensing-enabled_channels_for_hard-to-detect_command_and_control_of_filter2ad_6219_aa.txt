ABSTRACT
The proliferation of mobile computing devices has enabled immense
opportunities for everyday users. At the same time, however, this has
opened up new, and perhaps more severe, possibilities for attacks.
In this paper, we explore a novel generation of mobile malware
that exploits the rich variety of sensors available on current mobile
devices.
Two properties distinguish the proposed malware from the ex-
isting state-of-the-art. First, in addition to the misuse of the vari-
ous traditional services available on modern mobile devices, this
malware can be used for the purpose of targeted context-aware at-
tacks. Second, this malware can be commanded and controlled
over context-aware, out-of-band channels as opposed to a central-
ized infrastructure. These communication channels can be used
to quickly reach out to a large number of infected devices, while
offering a high degree of undetectability. In particular, unlike tradi-
tional network-based communication, the proposed sensing-enabled
channels cannot be detected by monitoring the cellular or wireless
communication networks. To demonstrate the feasibility of our
proposed attack, we present different ﬂavors of command and con-
trol channels based on acoustic, visual, magnetic and vibrational
signaling. We further build and test a proof-of-concept Android
application implementing many such channels.

INTRODUCTION
The mobile devices have become both “smart” as well as ubiq-
uitous in the recent years. Today’s mobile devices, such as smart
phones or tablets, are equipped with a multitude of sensors, enabling
them to detect their location, and learn the characteristics of their
users and the surrounding environment. These rich capabilities have
enabled many interesting applications and immense possibilities
for ordinary users. However, at the same time, they have opened
up the door towards new generation of mobile malware that can
exploit the on-board sensors for malicious purposes. Ranging from
eavesdropping over the phone call or user input [10,40,44], learning
user’s location [16] to snooping on the user’s activities [34], mobile
malware can gather sensitive information previously not available
to traditional malware.
In this paper, we argue that the sensors present in mobile devices
can also be used for out-of-band communication among malware
infected devices as well as for targeted command and control. For
example, the audio sensors present in a mobile phone can be used to
trigger malware located in a speciﬁc physical region. Malware can
also be triggered or commanded via audio/visual signaling trans-
mitted through television or radio broadcasts. While triggering is
currently possible via the cellular or wireless network channels, such
messages can easily be detected by monitoring these communica-
tion channels either at the mobile phone or at the network gateways.
Unlike the traditional command and control communication over a
centralized infrastructure (such as a cellular network), out-of-band
communication is very hard to detect and even harder to prevent.
However, it can be still be used to reach out to a large population of
infected mobile bots.
In addition to the misuse of the various traditional services avail-
able on modern mobile devices (such as phone calls or SMS/MMS),
we posit that this malware can be used for the purpose of targeted
context-aware attacks. For example, a malware that gets triggered in
a movie theatre, via say a hidden audio signal embedded in a com-
mercial, can be used for causing annoyance or even chaos; imagine,
for instance, the infected devices in the theatre all playing a loud
song or a siren suddenly.
Researchers have previously explored various forms of mobile
malware and different means of malware communication channels
including their detection and blocking. In particular, most of the
work has focused on wireless or wired network based command
469and control channels over the Internet, wireless, or cellular phone
networks. The threat posed by the situational and environmental
awareness of mobile malware and the use of the sensors to perform
hard-to-detect out-of-band communication has not been studied.
1.1 Our Contributions
The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we provide the
ﬁrst detailed study of environmental sensor-based covert channels
in mobile malware. In particular, we present different ﬂavors of
out-of-band command and control channels based on acoustic, light,
magnetic and vibrational signaling. Many of the proposed channels
provide a means of undetectable communication with a large num-
ber of malware infected devices such as through the use of broadcast
video or audio signals.
Second, to demonstrate the feasibility of our attacks, we build a
proof-of-concept malware application using an off-the-shelf mobile
phone on the Android platform implementing many of the proposed
channels. We conduct several experiments to validate the effec-
tiveness of these channels for command and control. Some of our
experiments are conducted in real-life setting and further conﬁrm
the threat posed by the presented mobile malware.
Third, we sketch the possibility of building geographically local-
ized attacks which can leverage upon the aforementioned out-of-
band channels.
1.2 Scope and Ethical Aspects
The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of out-
of-band channels for command and control of the malware. As
such, the scope of the paper is limited to the exploration, design
and analysis of such channels. In particular, the emphasis is on
sending undetectable triggers to infected devices over such channels.
Developing models, either theoretical or experimental in nature,
to estimate the latency and coverage of such channels (e.g., to
determine how many infected devices can get triggered in a given
time span) is beyond the scope of this work. However, we emphasize
that many of our channels naturally provide rapid message delivery
guarantees to a huge number of devices.
Although we are presenting essentially a new generation of attack
against mobile devices, the purpose of this work is ethically sound
and constructive. By pre-empting the design of this attack and
possibly “staying ahead in the game” against the real attackers, our
vision is to eventually come up with an effective defense against
the envisioned attack. Due to the high level of incentive available
to the attacker (high degree of undetectability), these attacks might
very well be launched in the wild in the near future. By means of
a publication on this topic, we hope to raise awareness about new
threats, and motivate fellow researchers, device manufacturers and
OS designers to build and deploy defenses before these attacks are
launched in the wild. In fact, we also discuss potential approaches
to defend against such malware, and aim to further extend them
in the near future. Many recently published papers on precisely
the same broad topic [8, 13, 19, 26, 37, 42, 46, 49, 50] (reviewed in
Section 7) further support and justify this line of security research.
Additionally, we are positive that the underlying communication
channels designed as part of our research will come handy in other
security applications in the future.
2. BACKGROUND AND THREAT MODEL
In this section, we discuss the motivation for out-of-band com-
mand and control, and the underlying threat model, and sketch the
possibilities for localized context-aware attacks enabled by out-of-
band channels.
2.1 Motivation: Why Use Sensors?
Many of today’s mobile devices such as smart phones are equipped
with optical, audio, vibration, and magnetic ﬁeld sensors. Some of
these sensors, such as accelerometers, are so sensitive that they have
been repurposed for distributed sensing applications such as earth-
quake detection [11]. The optical sensor and the camera present in
mobile phones are also becoming more sophisticated day by day.
For example, the Apple iPhone 4GS contains an 8 mega pixel digital
camera. Similarly, the microphones present in mobile phones are
sensitive enough to pick up very subtle sounds from the surrounding
environment. For instance, the iPhone 3g’s built-in microphone
can detect sound as low as 5 Hz to as high as 20 KHz [2]. Many
devices besides smart phones, such as tablets and laptops, also come
equipped with many of these sensors.
The sensors can serve as an appealing platform for out-of-band
communication among malware infected devices as well as between
the botmaster owner and infected devices. Unlike the traditional
centralized means of communication for malicious purposes, such
an out-of-band communication can remain very hard to detect, es-
pecially if covert and steganographic communication channels are
used. However, it can still be used to communicate with a large
number of devices, which can even span international borders. For
example, messages sent embedded within the audio of a popular
TV program can be delivered to a huge number of infected devices,
whose users would be watching such a program.
Easy Detectability of Network-based Channels: For the botnet
communication/triggering described above, a traditional network-
based channel, e.g., a TCP/IP based channel, is easily detectable.
TCP/IP-based triggers can be detected and/or blocked by a ﬁrewall
or anti-malware software which monitors network packets. Appli-
cations constantly polling incoming packets, registering for push
notiﬁcations, or accessing unknown web services can raise suspicion.
Even triggers steganographically hidden in benign communication
can still cause suspicion: why would an app run even benign proto-
cols with random servers (other than known backends), assuming
the botnet controller has not compromised legitimate servers?
Unique Advantages of Sensor-based Channels: The detection
of out-of-band signals is complicated by the fact that the out-of-
band trigger signal format can be free form. Traditional botnet
command and control messages, on the other hand, travel over
centralized networks obeying established protocols such as UDP or
TCP/IP. However, the out-of-band covert channels can use arbitrary
protocols to send the control and command messages. This makes
the detection of such communication quite difﬁcult in practice. Anti-
malware software also does not know which medium is used by
the botnet for covert communications: it must therefore monitor all
sensors constantly. Also, accessing a sensor is not necessarily the
“signature” of a malware: many legitimate applications need access
to sensors for benign purposes.
Sensor-based trigger channels have other useful properties. For
localized attacks, sensor channels are more effective than TCP/IP. In
an area, not all phones may use the same network or have network
connectivity, but most phones there share the same medium. Also,
without knowing infected devices’ IP addresses, the botnet controller
has no way to trigger them (other than broadcasting/ﬂooding entire
network, which is infeasible), whereas in sensor-based channels, the
controller does not have to know any addresses of infected devices.
2.2 System Model and Assumptions
Our system model is no different from the model employed in
traditional command and control of malware. Namely, we assume
that many mobile devices have already been corrupted with mal-
470ware. Such corruption could take place, for example, when the
user downloads an untrusted application – embedding the malware –
from the application store of the service being used. However, to
remain surreptitious, the malware on these devices will not activate
or get triggered until indicated by the botmaster. These triggers will
later be sent by the botmaster to (all or a subset of) infected devices
over out-of-band channels. Such channels can also be used for the
purpose of sending commands to the bots. However, in this paper,
our primary emphasis is on triggers.
We assume that the (malware) application is allowed to run in the
background and can access the device’s on-board sensors without
restriction. Indeed, as our prototype implementation shows, the
Android platform supports such apps when using a microphone, a
light sensor, and a magnetometer, as well as an accelerometer. Other
operating systems, such as iOS, may not conform to this policy.
However, it is also possible for the malware to attach itself to a
benign app that needs constant access to sensors as a background
process (e.g., a web search application that uses voice input).
Additionally, we assume that, with a very high probability, the
mobile devices are switched on and are in close physical proximity
of their users, either carried by the users in their pockets, purses or
backpacks, or lying close to them. For example, while watching TV,
a user’s phone is placed next to him/her. Given that modern users
heavily rely upon their mobile devices (especially phones), this is a
valid assumption to make [17, 18, 24, 25, 29, 31, 33, 41, 45, 47, 48].
Under a rare circumstance that a phone is powered off or not close
to the user, the messages can not delivered to that particular phone at
that particular time. This would only degrade the overall reachability
of the messages slightly.
Once activated by a trigger, the infected devices will carry out the
attacks they are programmed for. Traditionally, these attacks could
be used for the purpose of spam campaign, making illicit phone calls
or sending SMS/MMS messages. In addition to these attacks, we
envision another genre of attacks, which we discuss in the following
subsection, that can be used for targeted and localized threats.
2.3 Localized Targeted Attacks
A localized mobile botnet consists of malware infected mobile
devices physically present in a speciﬁc location. An attacker can
launch localized attacks on or through these devices. For example,
during a sports event, an attacker can trigger the malware-infected
