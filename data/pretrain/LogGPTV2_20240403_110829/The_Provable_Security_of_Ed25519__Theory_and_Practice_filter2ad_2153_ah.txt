point A ∈ (cid:10)B(cid:11). Then, B runs A on input A.
We ﬁrst analyze the probability of the received value A
falling into the subset of correctly distributed public keys to
invoke A. Note that the public key A in the identiﬁcation
protocol is computed as A ← sB with an s ∈ {2b−2, 2b−2 +
8, . . . , 2b−1 − 8}. We claim that for any public keys A1 =
s1B, A2 = s2B with s1, s2 ∈ {2b−2, 2b−2 + 8, . . . , 2b−1 − 8},
A1 = A2 if and only if s1 = s2. Note that for above s1, s2,
there must exist i1, i2 ∈ {0, ..., 2b−5 − 1} such that s1 =
2b−2 + 8i1 and s2 = 2b−2 + 8i2. Since L > 2b−5 is a prime,
it holds that
A1 = A2 ⇔ s1B = s2B
⇔ s1 = s2 mod L
⇔ 2b−2 + 8i1 = 2b−2 + 8i2 mod L
⇔ i1 = i2 mod L
⇔ i1 = i2
⇔ 2b−2 + 8i1 = 2b−2 + 8i2
⇔ s1 = s2
2251
L =
2252+27742...8493 ≈ 1
The above claim indicates that the cardinality of the set of
valid public keys equals 2b−5. Recall that the point A ∈ (cid:10)B(cid:11) is
.
uniformly at random. The probability of A being a valid public
key from A’s view is therefore bounded by 2b−5
L . In particular,
substituting the instantiation of Ed25519 for the corresponding
parameters, it holds that 2b−5
2, which
is obviously non-negligible.
Challenge: At some point A outputs a commitment R(cid:3) to its
challenger. B then chooses a random challenge ch1
$←−
{0, 1}2b and sends ch1 to A. Finally, A terminates with
output S1.
Resetting the adversary: Then, B resets A’s internal state
back to the point just after which it generated R(cid:3) and
$←− {0, 1}2b
returns a newly sampled challenge value ch2
to A with ch1 (cid:7)= ch2 mod L.
Finally, again, A will output a response S2. B veriﬁes
whether (R(cid:3), ch1, S1) and (R(cid:3), ch2, S2) both are accept-
ing conversations with ch1 (cid:7)= ch2 (mod L), and aborts
if this condition is not satisﬁed.
By the so-called Reset Lemma [59], we know that if A
can ﬁnd an S1 such that (R(cid:3), ch1, S1) is an accepting
(cid:3), then a reset of A with the
conversation with probability 

Assume that (R(cid:3), ch1, S1) and (R(cid:3), ch2, S2) are accepting
conversations with ch1 (cid:7)= ch2 (mod L). In particular, it holds
that Si ∈ {0, ..., L − 1} and 8SiB = 8R(cid:3) + 8chiA for i ∈
{1, 2}, which implies that
8(S1 − S2)B = 8(ch1 − ch2)A

Therefore, s = S1−S2

it holds that t ≈ 2t

Finally, we can deduce that the probability of B successfully

In the following let (com, ch, rsp) be a valid honest execution
between the prover and the veriﬁer. It holds that com is the
encoding of an element rB in the elliptic curve group with
r $←− {0, 1}2b, ch $←− {0, 1}2b and rsp is the encoding of an
element in {0, ..., L− 1} of the form (r + ch· s) mod L, with
s implicitly ﬁxed by the decoding of A = sB.
Clearly, the challenges are distributed identically in both
conversations. The (decoded) simulated responses S ← ˜s
$←− {0, 1}2b are also distributed identically to real
with ˜s
responses rsp = (r + ch · s) mod L, with r, ch $←− {0, 1}2b.
The same holds for the (decoded) simulated commitments
R ← (SB − chA) mod L = (S − ch · s)B mod L and the
real commitments com, since the latter are in the elliptic curve
group of the form com ← rB with r $←− {0, 1}2b, which is
equivalent to r

C. Proof for Theorem 2
Proof. We have shown in Lemma 1 that CID is zk-HVZK
with zk = 0. Since Sim(pk) uses public information only,
any resulting conversations could also have been computed
by A itself. A therefore learns nothing from the interaction
of P (cid:2) V via OTrans (replaced by Sim). Thus, for canonical
identiﬁcation protocols that are HVZK, IMP-PA security is

equivalent to IMP-KOA security and we have ave 

D. Proof for Theorem 5
Proof. Assume there exists an adversary A that can break the
(, QS)-S-UEO security of Ed25519. This means that for an
honestly generated key pair (A, k) $←− KGen, given the public
key A, A can output

APPENDIX C
MULTI-USER SECURITY
We recall that a ﬂaw in the tight reduction from multi-
user security of signatures to the single-user case in [30] was
exposed by Bernstein [31], who then was able to give an
alternative tight reduction from the multi-user security of key-
preﬁxed Schnorr to the single-user security of standard Schnorr.
This result was taken as a justiﬁcation for the much-debated
employed key preﬁxing in Ed25519 signatures. Shortly after the
result by Bernstein, Kiltz et al. [28] were able to provide a tight
reduction in the random oracle model for general Fiat-Shamir
signatures, assuming the property of random self-reducibility of
the underlying identiﬁcation protocol, further fueling the debate
(though at this time the IETF standardisation of Ed25519-IETF
had already been completed). Interestingly, when trying to apply
either of the above results to Ed25519 signatures speciﬁcally,
several peculiarities arise. The result by Bernstein [31] is
transferable to Ed25519 signatures, but loses tightness. As
explained in [31, Sec. 5.3] this is due to the clamping of secret
keys in Ed25519 which yields an additional failure case in
the reduction. The more general result by Kiltz et al. [28] on
the other hand is not applicable at all, although Ed25519 is a
Fiat-Shamir transformed signature scheme. This is precisely
due to the key preﬁxing as this prohibits the achievement of
the necessary random self-reducibility property. Consequently,
only the non-tight bounds in [31, Sec. 5.3] apply to Ed25519.
