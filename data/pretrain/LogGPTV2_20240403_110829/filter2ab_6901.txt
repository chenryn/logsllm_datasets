### Title: BlackHat Asia 2019: Intel VISA - Through the Rabbit Hole

**Abstract:**

The complexity of x86-based systems has reached a point where even specialists cannot fully grasp every aspect. The recent discovery of Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, along with numerous issues in the Intel Management Engine, highlights the intricate nature of these platforms. To manage this complexity, chip manufacturers must employ various tools for manufacturing verification and post-silicon debugging.

Our research uncovered that modern Platform Controller Hubs (PCH) and CPUs contain a full-fledged logic signal analyzer, which allows real-time monitoring of internal lines and buses. This technology, known as Intel Visualization of Internal Signals Architecture (VISA), is believed to be used for verifying chips on the manufacturing line. With a vast array of settings, VISA enables the creation of custom rules for capturing and analyzing signals. However, VISA documentation is subject to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and is not available to the public.

In our presentation, we will demonstrate how, using publicly available methods, one can access the full capabilities of VISA without any hardware modifications on readily available motherboards. We leveraged a previously discovered vulnerability, INTEL-SA-00086, to study this technology. Using VISA, we were able to partially reconstruct the internal architecture of the PCH and discovered dozens of hidden devices within the chip that have access to critical data.

During our talk, we will show how to read signals from PCH internal buses, such as the IOSF Primary and Side Band buses, and the Intel ME Front Side Bus, as well as other security-sensitive internal devices. Our findings highlight the potential for new security research and the importance of understanding the underlying architecture of modern computing platforms.
