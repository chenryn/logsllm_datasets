APPENDIX
Population categories and intersections. Provisional cate-
gories [64] of at-risk populations represented by our dataset
are listed in the ﬁrst column of Table I. While these population
categories ﬂatten some of the demographic richness reported
in individual dataset papers, where possible we unpack in-
tersectional issues using our thematic analysis and examples
that include more detailed participant descriptions throughout
the paper. For example, the “activists” category in Table I
describes activists across four continents, but examples note
the speciﬁc geography when relevant. Further, these popu-
lation categories are not exhaustive; instead they represent
our dataset, demonstrating how risk factors can diﬀer across
categories and intersect for a single category.
Biases in geographic representation. At-risk populations
are found around the world, with social and structural cir-
cumstances that vary globally. The papers identiﬁed in our
review skewed heavily toward Western, and speciﬁcally U.S.,
populations, but do include some studies with participants
from other regions. About half of the papers in our dataset
(48 out of 95 papers) included participants from the U.S.
only, and 68% of papers included participants from West-
ern countries only. Populations about which the literature
reported perspectives from around the world (including most
or all continents), included activists, journalists, NGO staﬀ,
crowdworkers, LGBTQ+ people, and survivors of traﬃcking.
Other non-Western perspectives were reported for women in
South Asia, older adults in Cambodia, people in developing
regions (in Asian and African countries), refugees (resettled
from Africa and Asia to the US), and people with visual
impairments in India. The remaining populations listed in
Table I represent Western perspectives.
Researcher reﬂexivity. Though we do not know how the
authors of dataset papers would identify their nationalities
or describe their lived experiences, the majority appeared to
be completed by teams at institutions in Western contexts.
Similarly, we work in U.S.-based organizations and have back-
grounds in HCI, computer science, security, and/or privacy.
These contexts inﬂuenced the papers we sampled and the
analysis lenses used—both by our team and the researchers
who produced dataset papers. While this SoK establishes a
framework, we advocate for additional perspectives to enrich
our ﬁndings.
