it is possible to use
symmetric signatures, and apply the tamper-evidence to the
peer-to-peer setting. The use of symmetric signatures only,
however, requires the coordinated randomized key evolution
between the pair of connected nodes. This can be achieved
under the condition that the adversary cannot access some of
the information exchanged by the legitimate parties. While
this assumes a weaker adversary than the one tolerated with
the asymmetric signatures, this model can still be practical
in some situations and has the advantage of eﬃciency oﬀered
by the symmetric signatures.
Combining tamper evidence with other features.
The tamper-evidence can be combined with other security
improvements for signatures: e.g., our constructions can
be easily generalized to the forward-secure [3] or intrusion-
resilient models [19, 17].
Monotone Signatures. The monotone signatures were
deﬁned by Naccache, Pointcheval and Tymen in [26]. These
10Clearly, the legitimate signer can issue such a revocation
note. Thus, the repudiation by faking an exposure still re-
mains a problem just as for the other types of signatures,
and is not addressed by tamper-evidence.
signature schemes allow updating the veriﬁcation algorithm.
Then, the legitimate signer can reveal some secrets under
duress. This would allow the extortionist to generate signa-
tures valid under the current veriﬁcation algorithm. How-
ever, when the signer is released, he can update the veriﬁ-
cation algorithm in such a way that all the signatures gen-
erated by the legitimate signer remain valid under the new
veriﬁcation procedure as well; but the signatures generated
by the extortionist are no longer valid.
In contrast to tamper-evident or forward-secure signa-
tures, the deﬁnitions of [26] do not include the possibility
of also updating the signer keys. We propose to use key-
evolving monotone signatures instead. Then we can achieve
the main features of the monotone signatures directly from
the tamper-evident signatures: The veriﬁcation algorithm
would include checking for tampering using Div and a sig-
nature for time period t − 1. The signer would maintain a
“correct” version of the secret key, as well as a version “di-
verged” in the current period. This divergence cannot be
detected against the signature of the “pre-diversion” period
t − 1, used in the current veriﬁcation. Thus, the signer can
release that diverged version under duress. Afterwards, he
can update the veriﬁcation by including a signature for the
period t. The attacker can be prevented from generating
earlier signatures by combining the above with the forward-
security. This method is certainly not any more eﬃcient
than the original constructions of [26]; it is given here solely
to illustrate the connection of the two concepts. However,
the eﬃciency of the monotone signatures can be improved by
the key-evolution: this approach is further developed in [20].
Open Problems and Other Potential Approaches.
The most interesting and challenging open problem is prob-
ably ﬁnding an alternative meaningful deﬁnition of tamper-
evidence to which our lower bounds do not apply.
It may also be interesting to investigate the probability of
the safety of each time period with respect to a given time
period of the exposure and the time of a second signature
selected according to some distribution. This may provide
a more realistic estimate of the security, since the adversary
may not know the time period of the signature against which
his signature is compared. This security can be pumped up
by testing the given signature against more than one signa-
ture selected according to the above mentioned distribution.
Determining the best distribution function to use would also
be an interesting problem.
Other potential approaches to the problem may include
the following: Suppose, we allow the Div test to occasion-
ally miss divergence and potentially give a false positive:
returning foul on two legitimate signatures.
In addition,
assume that F cannot obtain any signatures from S after
te. Then we may attempt the following approach. Deﬁne
some metric on the space of public keys, and restrict the
distance between consecutive public keys Si.PK ,Si+1.PK ,
so that there is still a multiple choice for the next public key.
Then evolution of the signer corresponds to a random walk.
We can now try to utilize the property that within one ran-
dom walk, the distance between the positions at times t1, t2
is likely to be noticeably smaller than the positions corre-
sponding to t1 and t2 on two diﬀerent random walks (which
diverged at some previous time te). It is unlikely, however,
that this approach could improve on our results above.
Other possible directions for future research include con-
sidering more interactive models of authentication (e.g.,
zero-knowledge proofs of identity [13, 12]), and extending
Div to use more than two signatures to detect tampering
(such an extension may impact some of the PKI-related is-
sues discussed in this section)
