Howdy!
Due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm currently stuck working on a project
that's a subdirectory in part of a larger git repo. To open the entire repo
directory would be a bit of a pain as well. I can work on the project just
fine otherwise but none of the git features are currently available which is a
disappointment.
What's preventing Code from being able to use Git regardless of the opened
project folder location (relative to the git root)?
The contrived example layout:
    /projects/engine/ <--- root of the repo
    /projects/engine/tools/my_application/ <--- here sits a package.json, gulpfile.js, etc etc
