  * VSCode Version: 1.2.0
  * OS Version: Linux version 3.19.0-32-generic
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open a new html file
  2. Write a '' tag
  3. Start writing the closing tag of the div ( '</' )
  4. Right now, VS Code should show 'div' as a possible suggestion
  5. However, once you start typing 'd' ( as in 'div' ), the suggestion disappears
I propose showing the suggestion until the user input stops matching the first
part of the suggestion.
I, for one, would find this helpful, because it feels more natural to keep
typing instead of moving my fingers towards enter, while still seeing what the
closing tag should look like
