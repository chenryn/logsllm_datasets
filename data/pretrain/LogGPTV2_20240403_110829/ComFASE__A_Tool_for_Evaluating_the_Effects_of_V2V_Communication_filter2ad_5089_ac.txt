### Observations and Experimental Setup

No significant differences were observed in the results when a propagation delay of 3.0s was chosen, compared to the reported outcomes. For the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, we set the propagation delay to 60s, implying that all messages are blocked until the end of the simulation.

### Result Classification

We classify the results into five categories based on the deceleration profiles and collision events of the vehicles, as detailed below. The deceleration profiles are selected based on previous studies of rear-end accidents [31].

- **Non-effective**: The injected attack has no effect on the behavior of the vehicles (i.e., identical speed profiles as in the golden run), and the simulation ends with no indication of failures.
- **Negligible**: The injected attack modifies the behavior of at least one vehicle, but the change is negligible. The recorded maximum deceleration is less than or equal to 1.53m/s², which is the maximum deceleration recorded in the golden run.
- **Benign**: The injected attack modifies the behavior of at least one vehicle, leading to a deceleration value greater than 1.53m/s² and less than or equal to 5m/s². This change is considered benign as it does not exceed the maximum comfortable braking rate of 5m/s².
- **Severe**: An experiment is classified as severe if (i) a collision occurs between the vehicles, or (ii) a vehicle performs an emergency braking. In the latter case, the injected attack modifies the behavior of at least one vehicle, leading to a deceleration value greater than 5m/s² and less than or equal to 8m/s².

### Experimental Results

#### Analyses of the Delay Attack Results

We conducted 11,250 experiments to model the delay attacks, using 25 attack start times, 15 attack values, and 30 attack end times (25 * 15 * 30 = 11,250). The results were classified as follows: 5,923 severe, 4,941 benign, and 386 negligible. The total simulation time for these experiments, including data parsing, was approximately 7 hours on a computer setup with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core processor and 96GiB system memory.

**Figure 5** shows the classification of results based on the duration to which the system under test was exposed to attacks. The figure indicates that attacks with durations greater than 5 seconds are always classified as either benign or severe. Additionally, exposing the target system to attacks for periods longer than 4.0 seconds does not significantly affect the number of severe cases. Notably, none of the experiments were classified as non-effective, and all severe cases resulted from vehicle collisions.

**Figure 6** presents the classification of results with respect to the different propagation delay (PD) values used in the experiments. For each PD value, 750 experiments were conducted (25 attack start times * 30 attack end times = 750). The figure shows that higher PD values result in a higher number of severe cases. However, no significant differences were observed for PD values larger than 2.2 seconds. We also conducted experiments with PD values up to 5.0 seconds, observing similar behavior.

The results were further analyzed with respect to the attack start times. For each attack start time, 450 experiments were conducted (15 attack values * 30 attack end times = 450). **Figure 7** illustrates that the majority of experiments are classified as severe when the initiation time is lower than 17.2 seconds or higher than 20.6 seconds. The number of severe cases changes drastically between attack start times of 19.4 seconds and 20.2 seconds.

To understand these results, we investigated the behavior of vehicles driving in a sinusoidal pattern, as shown in **Figure 4**. We observed that initiating attacks during periods of high acceleration by the lead vehicle can result in a higher number of severe cases. This is because, when the lead vehicle decelerates, the deceleration data is delivered with a delay to the other vehicles in the platoon, causing collisions. The other vehicles in the platoon still believe the lead vehicle has a high acceleration rate, while it has already started to decelerate. This explains the low number of severe cases for experiments with start times between 19.4 seconds and 20.2 seconds, where the acceleration rate is as low as 0 m/s², leading to a high number of benign cases.

Finally, we analyzed the impact of the attacks on the surrounding traffic. We focused on the severe cases, where the injected attacks cause collisions, and studied the vehicle responsible for the collision, known as the collider [32]. Out of 5,923 severe cases, the target vehicle (Vehicle 2) was responsible for 65.4% of the incidents, while Vehicle 3 and Vehicle 4 were responsible for 18.1% and 16.5% of the incidents, respectively. This confirms the importance of analyzing the impact of attack injections on surrounding vehicles when only one vehicle is targeted.

#### Analyses of the DoS Attack Results

We performed 25 DoS attack experiments, starting the attacks from 17.0 seconds to 21.8 seconds, with each experiment's start time 0.2 seconds apart. All experiments were classified as severe, leading to vehicle collisions. The results were also analyzed with respect to the vehicle that caused the collision (collider vehicle). The vehicle under attack (Vehicle 2) caused 48% of the collision incidents, while Vehicle 3 and Vehicle 4 caused 40% and 12% of the incidents, respectively.

Investigating the attack start times for the collision experiments, we found that if the attack is activated between 17.6 seconds and 19.4 seconds or 19.6 seconds and 20.0 seconds, it is Vehicle 3 and Vehicle 4, respectively, that are responsible for the collision. For the remaining attack start times, Vehicle 2 is responsible for the collision.

### Discussion

From a tester's perspective, the results presented in this section can be used to design future experiments. For example, the results obtained for experiments with shorter durations or propagation delay (PD) values can be used to estimate the number of severe cases for experiments with larger durations and PD values. As higher PD values lead to all experiment results saturating to only collision incidents.

Regarding the start time of an injection, the results show that initiating attacks during periods of high acceleration by the lead vehicle can significantly increase the likelihood of severe cases. This highlights the importance of considering the timing and duration of attacks in evaluating the safety implications of vehicular communication systems.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we presented ComFASE, a tool that facilitates the injection of faults and attacks in the wireless channel of vehicular communication systems. ComFASE is built upon OMNeT++, SUMO, and Veins simulators, allowing us to study the safety implications of the injected faults and attacks on the target vehicles and the surrounding traffic. Fault and attack models are implemented in separate scripts, facilitating the addition of new models. The tool runs batches of experiments automatically.

To evaluate ComFASE, we injected delay and denial-of-service attacks in a platooning scenario, demonstrating the tool's usefulness. We conducted 11,275 experiments, resulting in 5,948 collision incidents. The results revealed the importance of the attack's initiation time, duration, and the vehicles' driving patterns in causing collision incidents.

As part of our future work, we plan to extend ComFASE by modeling faults and attacks in the physical and application layers, as well as conducting jamming attacks in the wireless channel of vehicular communication systems. Additionally, we aim to integrate ComFASE with the INET simulator [33] [34], which offers other communication protocols such as 4G and 5G, to evaluate scenarios beyond platooning, such as teleoperation. Artery and Vanetza are also potential simulators to be integrated into ComFASE. Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols, and Vanetza has implemented the ETSI C-ITS protocol suite.
