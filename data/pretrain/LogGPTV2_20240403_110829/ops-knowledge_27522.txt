User: I am setting up a production server for the first time and would like to make sure I only have what I need for security prepress. 
By "interactions" since I'm also new to programming, I think I mean "API calls". 
Do I need mysql-client on a Linux (Debian) server to be able to 'talk' to mysql with any programming language? As I think there isn't any point installing the client on the production server if I can remotely send commands from mysql-client on my Mac.
Assistant: If you expect code running on the production server to connect to a mysql db, then yes.
