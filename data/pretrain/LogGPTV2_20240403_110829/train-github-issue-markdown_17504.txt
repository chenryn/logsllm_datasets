Hello,

I came across an issue today that I would like to bring to your attention. Please see the attached images for reference:

**Suggestion:**
To address this, I recommend adding a check to ensure that the `result` is not `null`. If the `result` is `null`, it should be ignored.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
