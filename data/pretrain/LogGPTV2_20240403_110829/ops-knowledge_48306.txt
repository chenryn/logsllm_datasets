User: How to configure network firewall to protect server from potential attacks and intrusions? Please provide a detailed firewall configuration scheme.
Assistant: The following is an example firewall configuration scheme, which can be adjusted according to specific situations: 1. Determine the goals and policies of the firewall, for example, only allow specific traffic to pass, block all traffic, and ban certain specific IP addresses. 2. Configure network interfaces and IP addresses to ensure that connections between the firewall and servers and other network devices are properly set up. 3. Configure firewall rules, use the firewall software's command line or graphical interface to define and arrange rule sets to control website traffic. Rules can be classified according to source IP address, destination IP address, port, and protocol. 4. Configure the firewall's log and alert settings to track network traffic and alert administrators when a potential attack or intrusion is detected. 5. Conduct regular firewall reviews and assessments to ensure the effectiveness and security of firewall rules. In setting the rules, you can consider the following suggestions: 1. Allow specific IP address/port combinations for communication, and prohibit unnecessary traffic to the server. 2. For security-sensitive services (such as SSH), non-essential inbound traffic should be prohibited. 3. Detect and limit repeated login attempts and brute-force password attacks. 4. Block all unnecessary inbound traffic such as ICMP (ping) and DNS (unless necessary). 5. Define familiar network traffic patterns and avoid unnecessary protocols and ports. 6. Carefully review all special access permissions, including VPN and other remote connections, and allow access only to necessary traffic. 7. Use a firewall to filter output traffic to ensure compliance and security of output data. 8. Enable the anti-attack function of the firewall, and set rules for Layer 7 and DoS/DDoS attacks. 9. Always keep firewall software updated and bug patched.
