Abstract
In a competitive e-commerce and e-business market, organizations want their business processes and
workflows to be simple, modular, easy to understand, easy to maintain and easy to re-engineer. To
achieve these objectives, one can calculate quality metrics of processes. Quality metrics can give an
important feedback concerning the readability, understandability, effort, testability, reliability and
maintainability of processes.
In the area of software engineering, quality metrics have shown their importance for good
programming practices and software designs. A design developed by the help of these metrics (e.g.
coupling, cohesion, complexity, modularity and size) as guiding principals is likely to be less error-
prone, easy to understand, maintain, and manage, and is more efficient. Several researchers already
identified similarities between software programs and business process designs and recognized the
potential of quality metrics in business process management.
This talk elaborates on the importance of quality metrics for business process modeling. It presents
a classification and an overview of current business process metrics and it gives an example of the
implementation of these metrics using the ProM tool.
Short biography
Jorge Cardoso (http://www.dme.uma.pt/jcardoso) joined the University of Madeira
(Portugal) in March 2003. He is currently the Director of the SEED Laboratory. He
previously gave lectures at University of Georgia (USA) and at the Instituto Politécnico de
Leiria (Portugal). Dr. Cardoso received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University
of Georgia in 2002 (with Amit Sheth). While at the University of Georgia, he was part of
the LSDIS Lab. where he did extensive research on workflow management systems. In
1999, he worked at the Boeing Company on enterprise application integration with
Christoph Bussler. Dr. Cardoso was the co-organizer and co-chair of the First, Second, and Third
International Workshop on Semantic and Dynamic Web Processes. He has published over 70 refereed
papers in the areas of workflow management systems, semantic Web, and related fields. He has also
edited 3 books on semantic Web and Web services. He is on the Editorial Board of the Enterprise
Information Systems Journal, the International Journal on Semantic Web and Information systems,
and the International Journal of Information Technology. He is also member of the Editorial Advisory
Review Board of Idea Group Inc. Prior to joining the University of Georgia, he worked for two years at
CCG, Zentrum für Graphische Datenverarbeitung, where is did research on Computer Supported
Cooperative Work.
