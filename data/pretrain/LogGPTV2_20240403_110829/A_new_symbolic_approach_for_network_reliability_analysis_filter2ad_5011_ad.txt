#### Algorithm 7: Pseudo Code for Connectivity Function

```pseudo
procedure BDDGEN(Src, Trg)
  // Src = source node
  // Trg = target node
  // B = BDD encoding the connectivity function
  // E = list of edges
  E = Src.getEdges()
  for e in E do
    Dst = dest node(e)
    if Dst == Trg then
      sp = e.getBdd()
      B = B + sp
    else
      sp = BDDgen(Dst, Trg) * e.getBdd()
