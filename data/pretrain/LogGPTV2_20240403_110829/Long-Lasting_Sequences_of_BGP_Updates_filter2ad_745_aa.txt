Abstract. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol that
makes the various networks composing the Internet communicate to each
other. Routers speaking BGP exchange updates to keep the routing up-
to-date and allow such communication. This usually is done to reﬂect
changes in the routing conﬁgurations or as a consequence of link failures.
In the Internet as a whole it is normal that BGP updates are continuously
exchanged, but for any speciﬁc IP preﬁx, these updates are supposed
to be concentrated in a short time interval that is needed to react to
a network change. On the contrary, in this paper we show that there
are many IP preﬁxes involved in quite long sequences consisting of a
large number of BGP updates. Namely, examining ∼30 billion updates
collected by 172 observation points distributed worldwide, we estimate
that almost 30% of them belong to sequences lasting more than one week.
Such sequences involve 222 285 distinct IP preﬁxes, approximately one
fourth of the number of announced preﬁxes. We detect such sequences
using a method based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform. We publish an
online tool for the exploration and visualization of such sequences, which
is open to the scientiﬁc community for further research. We empirically
validate the sequences and report the results in the same online resource.
The analysis of the sequences shows that almost all the observation points
are able to see a large amount of sequences, and that 53% of the sequences
last at least two weeks.

1 Introduction
Interdomain routers exchange BGP updates [31] to adjust routing tables. This is
done to reﬂect changes in the network, such as link/router failures/restorations
and routing policy changes. In the Internet as a whole it is normal that BGP
updates are exchanged almost continuously, but for any speciﬁc IP preﬁx, these
updates are supposed to be concentrated in the short time intervals, say a couple
of minutes (e.g., [21,38]), that are needed to react to network changes.
On the contrary, looking at the updates received from a router, it is quite com-
mon to observe long-lasting sequences of updates involving the same preﬁx. This
is well known from the very beginning of the Internet, and several researchers

discussed the reasons for that. E.g., [25] estimates that many BGP updates are
“pathological” and not needed for the correct behaviour of the protocol.
In this paper we focus on the problem of ﬁnding and studying long-lasting
sequences of updates, independently of their cause. This problem is, in our opin-
ion, important from several perspectives: (1) Any study on long-lasting sequences
of updates has to be well-founded on large sets of sequences detected with a rigor-
ous method; this is true either to perform a root-cause analysis of such sequences
or to analyse them to deepen the understanding of BGP dynamics. (2) Only a
clear understanding of the quantity and of the features of long-lasting sequences
can allow to state if such sequences can be a challenge for the scalability of inter-
domain routing. However, the matter is complicated: (1) Giving a deﬁnition of
long-lasting sequence is elusive. For example it can be arbitrarily said that a
sequence is such if it contains a certain amount of updates for each consecutive
day, hour, or minute. But all these pragmatic alternatives are questionable. (2)
Currently, about 1 million preﬁxes (IPv4 + IPv6) are announced in the Inter-
net. Studying from several observation points and within a large time-span the
generated BGP updates, raises substantial computational issues.
We examine the updates collected by 172 observation points (Collector Peers
or CPs) distributed around the world, for the entire Year 2019. The CPs are
those of RRC00 of the RIPE RIS Project [6]. Since each CP has its own timing
and its own visibility of the Internet, we process the updates received by each
one independently. We show that almost 30% of the about 30 billion updates
collected by the CPs belong to 434 790 sequences lasting more than one week
and involving 222 285 distinct IP preﬁxes (i.e., approximately one fourth of the
number of announced preﬁxes). We detect such sequences using a method based
on the Discrete Wavelet Transform, we report and visualize them in a Web
site [7] open to the scientiﬁc community for further research work. We inspect
and validate a random sample of the sequences. The results of the validation
are summarized in Sect. 4 and reported on the Web site. The analysis of the
sequences shows that almost all the CPs are able to see a large amount of
sequences, and that 53% of these sequences last at least two weeks.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the broad related
work. In Sect. 3 we present a deﬁnition of long-lasting sequence and a methodol-
ogy, based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform, to ﬁnd such sequences. In Sect. 4
we apply the methodology to examine one year of BGP updates and discuss
how the detected sequences are visualized. We also validate and analyse the
sequences. Conclusions are in Sect. 5.
2 Related Work
In the past years various works have been published on the analysis of BGP
data for the identiﬁcation of anomalies and instabilities. In [25], the authors
study BGP data exchanged between backbone service providers at US IXPs,
in 1998. It classiﬁes instabilities in ﬁve categories, and it estimates that 99%
of the BGP data exchanged is redundant and pathologic (no topology changes).
Long-Lasting Sequences of BGP Updates

The work in [26], some years later, re-evaluates the situation and sets to 16% the
new rate of pathological BGP messages, most of which are redundant announce-
ments. The reduction of the rate is attributed to software improvements intro-
duced by router manufacturers. The rate of BGP messages has been analysed
again in [18]. Contrarily to the previous estimations, they report that 40% is
the amount of BGP messages redundant and not promoting topology changes
(mostly re-announcements). The authors in [15] propose a solution for identifying
BGP instabilities. Single features of the BGP updates are monitored every ﬁve
minutes, and anomalies are identiﬁed based on statistical estimations on feature
ﬂuctuations observed by comparing diﬀerent time windows of data for the same
peer. In [39] is presented a technique for the identiﬁcation of network events
involving multiple preﬁxes. Such technique is based on the principal component
analysis of BGP updates, which is used to identify temporal correlations among
updates originated by diﬀerent ASes. In [38], BGP updates involving the same
CP-preﬁx pair are clustered together, and diﬀerent events are detected based on
changes in the frequency of the updates. The authors estimate that a normal
event lasts around 200 s, events lasting longer should be considered anomalies.
Similarly, in [29] a hard threshold of 46 updates/day for the same CP-preﬁx pair
is adopted to diﬀerentiate between normal updates and anomalies. Such thresh-
old is determined as the 1% of the CDF of the daily updates across all the CPs of
Route Views [36]. The authors estimate that 80% of the preﬁxes in their dataset
surpasses such threshold in 3 years. The paper [33] studies BGP updates in RIS
and Route Views from diﬀerent origin ASes and ﬁnds that many of them contain
correlated information of events seen by many routers. The authors propose a
methodology, based on the average distance between ASes in AS paths, able to
distinguish such events in global or local ones.
Other works are based on statistical analyses. For example, in [19] the spa-
tial and temporal correlation of BGP messages is analysed. In particular, the
authors exclude long-range dependence (LRD) among BGP messages. A long-
range dependence exists when data series have a strong time correlation and their
auto-correlation function decays very slowly. This work is particularly important,
because introduces the concept of LRD on BGP data that we also use in our anal-
ysis. However, a similar analysis [24] in 2015 concluded with the opposite result:
BGP time series are long-range dependent. Additionally, BGP message rates are
characterized as highly volatile, since peak rates exceed daily averages by sev-
eral orders of magnitude. We believe the reason behind such diﬀerent results is
induced by the small observation time frame of the ﬁrst work compared to the
second one: they observe 3 days and 8.5 years, respectively. We also identify the
long-range dependence in our work, this will be explained in the next sections.
In [10], the authors look for a recurrent behaviour among BGP updates collected
in ﬁve days by RIS’ RRC03. They use auto-correlation, Fourier transform, and
recurrence plots to analyse the time series and observe that BGP updates often
repeat in time according to patterns. Recurrence plots [17] are drawings used to
highlight recurring patterns in time series.

BGP data have been analysed also with the help of the Wavelet Trans-
form [11]. In [30], the authors analyse two years of BGP data collected in an
academic research network with the goal of detecting anomalies by identifying
patterns such as self-similarity, power-law, or lognormal marginals. To inves-
tigate on the self-similarity they use the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
Based on the result of the DWT, they exploit a scalogram which we also adopt
and describe in Sect. 3. An anomaly detection tool called BAlet is presented
in [27]. The tool is based on the observation that anomalies provoke abrupt
increases of BGP updates. It uses the wavelet analysis for the identiﬁcation of
such anomalies. The authors conﬁrm the property of self-similarity and LRD of
interdomain routing data. In [13], the authors propose a methodology to classify
BGP anomalies by considering the characteristic of multiple time scales. They
propose a multi-scale long short-term memory model where the DWT is used
to obtain temporal information on multiple scales. In [23] the author provide
a complete taxonomy for BGP messages based on their eﬀect on the routing
process. Additionally, they provide a tool, named BLT, able to automatically
classify BGP messages in such taxonomy. This classiﬁer is later applied on Route
Views data (LINX collector) to detect anomalies. The number of BGP messages
labeled with the same class, in a speciﬁc time period, is the parameter mon-
itored to detect deviation from usual rates. Finally, they apply such anomaly
detection system on ﬁve well-known Internet events. However, none of the above
papers focuses on identifying long-lasting sequences (way more than 200 s [38])
of BGP updates. Also, most of the used data is either collected inside a speciﬁc
network, or it is geographically or temporally limited. Further, while several of
the previous works identify anomalous phenomena, none of them provides a way
to visually explore and analyse the related sequences.
3 Extracting Sequences from Time Series
BGP routers exchange messages called BGP updates (for brevity, updates). An
update contains, among other information, a (possibly empty) set of announced
preﬁxes, and a (possibly empty) set of withdrawn preﬁxes. Let u be an
update, we denote by reach(u) the set of preﬁxes announced by u and by
unreach(u) the set of preﬁxes withdrawn by u. We have that, for each update u,
reach(u) ∩ unreach(u) = ∅ and |reach(u) ∪ unreach(u)| ≥ 1. A Route Collector
is a BGP router that collects the updates received by its peers (called CPs), and
that labels each received update with the second in which the update is received,
denoted by time(u), and with the CP from which the update is received, denoted
by cp(u). A Time Series of Updates is the set of all the updates received by a
Route Collector in a certain interval of time; we usually denote a time series with
a capital letter, like U. Also, we denote by U(n) the set of updates collected at
second n. Given a time series U, we denote with start(U) and end(U) respec-
tively the start and end seconds of its interval. Given a time series of updates
U, we are interested in focusing on updates collected by a speciﬁc CP cp and
containing a certain preﬁx ρ; we denote it Ucp,ρ.

Transforming a Time Series of Updates into a Signal. Given the time
series Ucp,ρ, we associate to it a discrete time series ucp,ρ constructed as fol-
lows: we set ucp,ρ(n) = |Ucp,ρ(n)|. Informally, ucp,ρ(n) = a means that at time
n, collector peer cp received a updates containing ρ. As is, ucp,ρ is not suit-
able for a time-frequency analysis. In fact, the magnitude of ucp,ρ(n) at time
n cannot be interpreted as the value of the signal, but it represents a value of
frequency (number of updates) received at time n. Also, consider the maximum
value M = maxstart(ucp,ρ)≤n≤end(ucp,ρ) ucp,ρ(n), we have that the time series cor-
responds to a signal whose maximum frequency is M updates per second. Hence,
in order to analyse the signal, we need to construct a Hertzian frequency rep-
resentation of ucp,ρ. According to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem [34], such a
representation should contain samples taken with a sampling time Ts  2M.
From ucp,ρ we construct a binary code word wcp,ρ composed by a rectangular
pulse train that is the signal we are going to analyse. Each second n of wcp,ρ
contains a sub-train of at least 2 · ucp,ρ(n) pulses. The pulses in the train are
distributed in such a way to have a duty-cycle that is as much as possible equal
to 50%. This duty-cycle requirement is imposed to improve the quality of the
signal analysis in the frequency domain [35]. Formally, we have that each second

n of wcp,ρ contains the following sub-train of pulses w
be the temporal frequency value to represent at the second n and let ωn = 2π· fn
be the related angular frequency of the oscillation at the same time n. We have,

where sgn(x) = −1, = 0, and = 1 if x  0, respectively. In
practice, we insert into the sequence wcp,ρ at least 2M time slots for each second
of the sequence ucp,ρ.
A Signal-Based Deﬁnition of Sequence. According to [24] when the sig-
nal obtained from a time series of updates has the burst presence of sam-
ples with a non-zero amplitude, it shows the features of a non-stationary and
extremely volatile stochastic process. More importantly, it shows long-term cor-
relation and memory eﬀects. Similar features have been observed also by other
authors (e.g., [8,30]), together with a self-similar behaviour. For these reasons,
the sequences we are interested in can be distinguished from other sequences of
updates because they exhibit such features.
The DWT Decomposition and the Multi-resolution Analysis. It has
been observed in [9] that the Discrete Wavelet Transform or, more precisely,
the Discrete-Time Wavelet Transform [11] (in what follows DWT ) is a suitable
method for searching sequences with the requested features. Hence, we analyse
the signal wcp,ρ in the Wavelet domain performing a discrete multi-resolution
analysis. The DWT permits to obtain a local representation of the signal,

showing it in a time-frequency plane. The DWT series decomposition of the
signal wcp,ρ (n) is deﬁned as follows:
wcp,ρ (n) =

k=0
c(cid:3),kφ(cid:3),k(n) +
(cid:3)(cid:2)
K(cid:2)
j=1
k=0
dj,kψj,k(n)
where we have that K + 1 is the number of samples of the signal. For the sake
of simplicity we assume that K = 2(cid:3) − 1, with (cid:7) the number of the frequency
bandwidth levels. Function φ is the father wavelet and ψ is the mother wavelet
For a complete deﬁnition of the DWT see Appendix A.
Applying the DWT. Because of our deﬁnition of wcp,ρ, we range k between
start(wcp,ρ) and end(wcp,ρ). Also, we choose fs = 2M samples per second (limit
case). Further, we select the range for j in such a way to capture the periodicities
with a certain maximum value. Namely, suppose we are interested in signals with
maximum periodicity λ we set (cid:7) to log2(M λ).
As far as the father and the mother wavelet functions are concerned, we
decided to use the Haar functions deﬁned as follows:
⎧
0 ≤ n < 1,
⎪⎨

−1 1 ≤ n < 2,
⎪⎩
otherwise.
0
(cid:3)
1 0 ≤ n < 2,
0 otherwise.
ψ(n) =
φ(n) =
Other options are possible, e.g., we might use Gaussian kernel functions, typ-
ically modulated by several types of polynomials, Daubechies’s family functions,
the Biorthogonal family one, etc. We opt for the Haar basis function because,
even if it has slightly more uncertainty, it allows to compute the DWT faster,
and this is crucial for the large amount of data we analyse.
Looking for Sequences Using the DWT. According to the above discussion
we have to look for sequences that exhibit long term correlation and memory
eﬀects. We search them as follows. Given a DWT, a scalogram representation
can be computed. Informally speaking (see Appendix A for more details), a
scalogram representation is a matrix P , where P [j, k] represents the percentage
of the signal power at time k in the range of frequencies Δf j deﬁned below:
