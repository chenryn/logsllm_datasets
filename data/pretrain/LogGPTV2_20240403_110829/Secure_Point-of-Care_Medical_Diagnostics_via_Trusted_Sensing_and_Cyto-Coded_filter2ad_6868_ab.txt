without the need to explicitly screen password entry by the
user. Consequently, the diagnostic information can be returned
to a patient or stored in cloud for a later access by the patient’s
practitioner.
Threat model. We have microfabricated a multi-electrode
cytometer with the ability to obtain, modulate and obfus-
cate peak number during data acquisition. A cryptographic
algorithm is imposed on the bio-sensor via electrode key
multiplexing, making the true number of peaks unattainable
to potential eavesdroppers who do not have the appropriate
security key. The proposed method allows for elevated secu-
rity in diagnostic devices against conﬁdentiality attacks when
transmitting sensitive medical data over the network or their
processing in the cloud. Contrary to previous work that uses
encryption or authentication as an independent component
in a system design, our encryption is embedded in the cy-
tometry operations. This close coupling between the signal
acquisition and the encryption process allows our setup to
have a very small trusted computing base (TCB). MedSen’s
trusted computing base is its sensor. Aside from the sensor,
which physically manipulates the patient blood sample, and the
combination of a small controller and a multiplexer responsible
for managing the diagnostic experiment settings (electrodes
voltage and current), no other component has access to the true
cytometry information. MedSen neither trusts the smartphone
nor the remote server, because they both see only the encrypted
measurements and the analysis outcomes. Those parties are
assumed to follow a curious but honest adversarial model.
III. MEDSEN SYSTEM DESIGN
A. Bio-sensor
MedSen bio-sensor is integrated in its microﬂuidic system
and acquires data by monitoring the electrical
impedance
across the channel. Figure 3 shows MedSen’s electrical
impedance measurement setup in the microﬂuidic channel that
consists of co-planar electrodes. The electrical impedance of a
bead (micro-particle) passing through the microﬂuidic channel
is detected by changes in measured impedance between the
electrode pair (capacitor). The input electrode is excited with
a continuous AC signal at a ﬁxed frequency. The output

microﬂuidic channel. Figure 5a shows the designs of two sets
of sensing electrodes. On the left side, the bio-sensor has
two independent outputs; on the right side, the bio-sensor
has three independent outputs. Similarly, Figure 5b describes
the design of bio-sensors with ﬁve and nine independent
outputs on the left and right sides, respectively. The input
excitation to all electrode pairs in each sensing region are tied
together to a common excitation source. The analog front-end
circuitry connected to the output electrodes captures the current
change between the electrode pairs in microﬂuidic channel
independently as a cell passes through. Figures 5c and 5d
show the details of the active regions each sensor in Figures
5a and 5b, respectively. The lead electrode in the array of
output electrodes, is deﬁned as the lower left electrode in each
sensing region. The lead electrode is only complemented by
one input electrode on its right side. Thus, it will respond with
a single voltage drop per passing cell; whereas the remaining
output electrodes are surrounding on both sides by common
excitation electrodes. Each of the remaining electrodes in the
sensing regions will respond with a signature of double peak
per passing cell.

at center) has width of 30 μm and length of 500 μm. The larger regions at
both ends of the measurement pore allow the beads/cells to disperse before
entering the measurement pore. The two circles depict the inlet and outlet of
the microﬂuidic channel after the PDMS is remove with biopsy punchers.
C. Microﬂuidic Channel
For evaluation and testing of the sensing platform, we an-
alyze the impedance of different synthetic bead types (7.8 μm
and 3.58 μm) and the blood cells passing though electrode
pairs embedded in the microﬂuidic channel. These speciﬁc
bead sizes are chosen as they approximate the dimension of
various cells found in human blood. The microﬂuidic channel
is designed to accommodate the transport of blood cells
and beads passing through electrode pairs. In the interest of
counting and modulating the number of cell counts passing in
the microﬂuidic channel, the channel dimension were designed
to pass a single bead or cell through electrode pairs one at a
time. Figure 6 describes the design of microﬂuidic channel.
The measurement pore, which is the narrow channel at center,
helps to single out and deliver synthetic beads and blood
cells in succession. The wide regions at both ends of the
measurement pore allow the beads or blood cells to disperse
before entering the measurement pore of microﬂuidic channel.
The two circles depict the inlet and outlet of the channel after
the PDMS is removed using biopsy punchers.
IV. SENSOR-BASED ANALOG SIGNAL ENCRYPTION
We describe how MedSen encrypts cell signal measure-
ments. It uses a symmetric analog encryption scheme that re-
lies on the choice and secrecy of a key to protect the encrypted
measurements. The encryption operations are embedded in
the sensor itself and infer no overhead for the encryption
operation in terms of time overhead. To enable encryption,
the sensor components have been speciﬁcally crafted using
multiple electrodes to modulate peak counts generated by cells,
such that no external entity can recover knowledge of the
number of cells passing through the channel from a speciﬁc

would result in peaks of arbitrary widths for cells of identical
type. By leveraging these three parameters, the number of
active electrodes, the electrodes gain and the ﬂuid ﬂow speed
on the channel, the controller can generate any number of
peaks with any shape. These transformations allow the sensor
to conceal the sensitive cell information and to later recover
them thanks to the parameters embedded in the key.
The speciﬁc sequence of electrodes turned on or off, the
set of output gains applied to electrodes and the ﬂuid ﬂow
speed in the micro channel constitute the encryption key of the
biomarker measurement signal. To preserve the initial signal’s
conﬁdentiality, every peak p associated to a cell would have a
different set of chosen parameters, or key Kp, such that:
Kp = (Ep, Gp, Sp)
(1)
with Ep is the binary vector representing the sequence of on/off
electrodes, Gp is the sequence of electrodes gains, and Sp
represents ﬂow speed on the channel. Such a design choice
would lead to a key size of length L = cKp for c number of
cells passing through the channel. Such a setup is comparable
to the perfectly secret one-time pad encryption scheme [28];
every signal peak is encrypted with its own randomly generated
key. Accordingly, the key length varies linearly as function
of the number of cells. Such an encryption algorithm would
ensure a perfectly secret encryption since it can produce
any resulting shape for a given original signal. In practice,
applying a different set of parameters per cell measurement
is challenging as it increases the key size, and would require
MedSen to be aware of every cell entering and leaving the
channel. Moreover, we observed that multiple cells can pass
through the channel with a distance interval inferior to the
distance between the ﬁrst and last electrode. Thus, two or more
cells may appear among the electrodes simultaneously; this
complicates the signal encryption and decryption procedures.
Consequently, MedSen implements an alternative scheme that
periodically changes the encryption parameters every time unit:
K(t) = (E(t), G(t), S(t)).
This cipher has the key characteristic that the encrypted
signal can still be processed to detect voltage peaks. A peak
detection algorithm (Section VI-A) can be performed on the
encrypted signal and returns encoded peak count, with associ-
ated time-stamps, amplitudes and widths. Given a ciphertext, it
is impossible for a domain knowledgeable attacker to infer the
patient diagnostic. Only the controller, which knows the input
values applied to each control parameter, is able to recover
the real signal amplitude and cell count associated to the
ciphertext signal peaks. It is noteworthy that the presented
infer any noticeable encryption
encryption scheme do not
computation overhead or delay since it
is based only on
hardware conﬁguration, built in the sensor. The decryption
requires light computation (multiplications and divisions) and
can be performed on MedSen’s resource-constrained controller.
MedSen hides the number of cells with the multiple
electrodes sensor deployment that generates multiple peaks
per cell. So, the attacker cannot recover the number of cells
captured in the chamber. A determined attacker would then
try to recover the number of electrodes turned on and off in
a particular channel to recover the peak multiplication factor
generated by the multiple electrodes. By dividing the number
of peaks observed in a data set by the multiplication factor,
the attacker would recover the initial number of cell passing
through the channel. Considering that each cell has a speciﬁc
signature in term of voltage drop when passing through a set of

number of peaks on a signal acquired. This encryption scheme
can also alter the measured signal peaks’ amplitude and width
such that the resulting encrypted signal can be analyzed by
an untrusted third party processing resource,
like a cloud
service, without revealing any useful cytometry information.
Eventually, only the bio-sensor in possession of the patient,
can decipher the information carried in the analyzed signals
based on the randomly generated key that it had generated
initially.
A. Cipher Design and Security Analysis
The strength of MedSen’s signal encryption methodology
relies on its bio-sensor’s reconﬁgurability to generate various
signal measurements, possibly with different amplitudes and
shapes for a single cell passing through the channel. The sensor
conﬁguration is determined dynamically by the randomly gen-
erated key on MedSen’s bio-sensor micro-controller. MedSen’s
sensor design hides the information carried by a signal from
the external untrusted entities by generating multiple signal
peaks of different shapes.
A cell passing through electrodes consistently generates
a voltage drop between the electrodes. Figure 7 shows such
a variation in our empirical experiments. The peak used to
infer a diagnosis (Section II). Our cipher leverages a speciﬁc
sensor design and a custom protocol to multiply and transform
a signal acquired from a single cell into a random sequence
of signals unrelated to the cell properties. Only the random
sequence issued by the micro-controller, which deﬁnes the
sensor conﬁguration can decrypt the values behind the sensor
measurements. To randomly clone a single peak signal into
multiple peaks signal, the sensor activates and uses multiple
electrodes that are selectively powered on or off in such
way that the bio-sensor generates a random succession of
electrode order. The response of such electrodes conﬁguration
will precipitate signal with peak count number output larger
than the actual number of cells passing through the micro
channel. The resulting multi-peak signal conceals the actual
number of cells passing through the channel. For example,
Figure 8 shows the resulting signal of a single blood cell
detected by MedSen, resulting in a ﬁve-peak signature for a
single cell.
This resulting signal hides the number of cells, but still
carries information about the cells. Speciﬁcally, the amplitude
or the width of a voltage drop can reveal information about the
composition or shape of the cell. To protect both information,
MedSen cipher design leverages two more parameters to
protect this information. First, randomly chosen voltage gains
can be applied by electrode such that none of the peaks
carries the amplitude drop of the original signal. This gain
information is incorporated as part of the encryption key.
Similarly, a modiﬁcation of the ﬂow speed on the channel

initially. If the identiﬁer recovered from the ciphertext differs
from the the one used to fetch the data from the remote
service, then the ciphertext is not the one corresponding to
the identiﬁer. Section VI and Section VII describe how to
chose the bead types and concentrations in order to generate a
dictionary of unique identiﬁers with limited risk of collisions
of passwords by different users.
Additionally,
the abovementioned cyto-coded identiﬁer
could also be used for server-side user authentication. The
bead sample (cyto-coded identiﬁer) is fed to MedSen’s bio-
sensor with the bio-sensor level encryption turned off such
that the server-side can reconginize the actual number and
types of the submitted beads for authentication purposes.
Consequently,
the proposed cyto-coded identiﬁer could be
leveraged differently based on the speciﬁc use-case, where
MedSen is being deployed for.

IMPLEMENTATIONS
A. MedSen Bio-Sensor Fabrication
MedSen’s microﬂuidic channel master mold is fabricated
on a silicon (Si) substrate using standard process of soft-
lithography [34]. The photomask for the photolithography pro-
cess is design in AutoCAD and fabricated by Advance Repro-
ductions Corp. (North Andover, MA). The silicon substrate is
cleaned in acetone and methanol baths using ultrasonic cleaner
before fabrication. To fabricate the mold, the Si wafer is coated
coated with SU-8 photoresist (MicroChem Inc., Westborough,
MA) and exposed to UV light under the photomask to create
the molding patterns. The coated wafer is then developed in
MicroChem’s SU-8 developer and baked to harden the micro-
patterns on the wafer.
Microﬂuidic channel. MedSen’s microﬂuidic channel is con-
structed with polydimethylsiloxance (PDMS) using standard
molding techniques [34]. PDMS is an alternative material to
silicon micro-machining for fabricating microﬂuidic channels
enabling low-cost rapid prototyping. One of the most important
characteristics of PDMS is the optical transparency of the
material. The PDMS elastomer is transparent under optical
frequencies. Micro-fabricated channels are inspected both vi-
sually or under a microscope. Additionally, PDMS can be
covalently bonded to Si, glass substrates or to PDMS itself
by oxygen plasma treatment. This allows the fabrication of
multi-layer structures in microﬂuidic systems [18]. The major
advantages of PDMS in microﬂuidic system construction is the
inexpensive process and rapid fabrication of devices. Microﬂu-
idic channels can be cast repeatedly using a master mold. The
elasticity of PDMS allows casting of the devices to release
the master mold without damaging it. Thus, a single master
mold can be used in mass production of microﬂuidic channels.
Furthermore, the construction of simple microﬂuidic channels
can be done in one single casting stage of PDMS as opposed to
multiple steps required with silicon and glass micromachining
techniques. This channel fabrication technique reduces the time
of microﬂuidic channel construction.
A microﬂuidic channel with dimension of 30 μm width
and 20 μm height
is cast using master mold as designed.
Sylgard R(cid:2) 184 silicone elastomer base and curing agent (Dow
Corning) are mixed uniformly at 10:1 in weight ratio to
produce PDMS solution. To create the channel features, the
solution is slowly poured on top of the mold to establish
conformal contact with the mold. The mixture is cured in 80 ◦C
before peeling off to make microﬂuidic channel. Due to the

electrodes, the attacker would try to detect consecutive peaks
of the exact same amplitude and then infer the number of
electrodes on. The cipher design protects this information by
applying random gains on each electrode output. This changes
the signal amplitude and thus conceals the initial signal charac-
teristic. Similarly, an attacker could try to recognize peaks that
