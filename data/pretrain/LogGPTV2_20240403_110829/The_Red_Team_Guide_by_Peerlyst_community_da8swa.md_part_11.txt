An attacker can also inject a [fake](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/fake)
'FIN' packet or an out-of-sequence packet number that can cause an IDS
to 'hiccup' and allow a malformed packet through to the
[host](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/host) target (e.g.,
[Web](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/web) or file
[database](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/database) servers).

Low Time-To-Live (TTL) packet values refers to the amount of time the
packet is allowed to remain active before it disappears forever. An
option to bypass detection is to combine packet fragmentation with a low
[TTL](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/ttl) value. This method attempts to
trick the IDS/IPS into allowing a packet destined for a host that is
behind the IDS. There will be some amount of trial and
[error](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/error) before an attacker knows
whether these techniques are successful.

How is this useful in terms of Red Team activities? Depending on the Red
Team's agreed upon Rules of Engagement (ROE) with the customer, they
might consider sending a stego-file containing malware such as a
backdoor Trojan (e.g., macro-enabled MS Word or Excel are a couple of
options). This is a technique that could be combined with Red Team

[attacks](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/social-engineering-attacks) as
an attachment on a spear phishing or
[whaling](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/whaling) email. Considering that
most corporate executives are statistically male, the highest
[probability](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/probability) of success with
blind spear phishing or whaling
[emails](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/emails) is to attach a
stego-image file of an attractive female that relates to whatever

Incorporating [digital steganography as an advanced malware detection
evasion
technique](https://www.peerlyst.com/posts/digital-steganography-as-an-advanced-malware-detection-evasion-technique-ian-barwise-m-s-cissp-ceh-cnda?trk=search_page_search_result)
requires an advanced level of skill. Accordingly, malware that
incorporates steganography to mask its presence is typically
custom-written by skilled malware developers. There are malware
[development](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/development) tools available
on the [Dark Web](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dark-web) for a price,
but it is highly advised that [Red
Team](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/red-team-pentesters)
[pentesters](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/red-team-pentesters) not use
such software as it is often malware itself and is
[illegal](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/illegal) to possess.
#### \*\*NOTE: If found to be in possession or to have used malware, a person can be arrested and charged with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) as well as other laws. The type of malware suggested here is for Red Team exercises only and should only contain benign exploit payloads that do not inflict any actual system damage in accordance with the rules of engagement that the customer and Red Team have agreed upon.
> **Covert Channel Data Exfiltration Using DNS Tunneling**
In a protected system environment complete with
[firewalls](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/firewalls), anti-virus/malware
software, IDS/IPS, external communication between the malware or
[spyware](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/spyware) and a [Command and
Control](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/command-and-control) (C&C) server
is relegated to communicating over covert channels or else it
[risks](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/risks) immediate detection. Domain
Name [Service](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/service) (DNS) plays a
vitally important role on the Internet by translating [IP
addresses](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/ip-addresses) to website
[domain names](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/domain-names) and
[vice](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/vice) versa, among other functions.

Tunneling](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dns-tunneling) works; image
courtesy of
[help.zscaler.com](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/about-dns-tunnel-detection)
The [DNS](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dns) protocol operates using
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and limits outbound queries to 255 bytes of
alphanumeric characters and hyphens. The fact that DNS operates using
[UDP](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/udp) and has such small size
constraints on external queries is exactly why DNS is an ideal choice
for smuggling data into and out of a network. No one would suspect it,
and [DNSSEC](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/dnssec) may not be enabled or
fully defend against DNS tunneling.

Due to the fact that data can be secretly embedded into the DNS protocol
packets, DNS [tunneling](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/tunneling) can be
considered a lesser-known form of digital steganography.
## Linux Crontab Command
[Kronos](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/kronos) was the Greek god of
time, and of [course](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/course), Linux has
named its command function for scheduling timed
[automated](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/automated) actions as
"[crontab](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm)". Attackers
can use 'crontab' commands to remotely schedule covert actions to occur
on a [breached](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/breached) system at
periodic intervals. For instance, an attacker may want to have a listing
of new file names that were added to the system sent back to the
[C&C](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/c-and-c) server on a weekly basis
using hidden DNS tunneling.
To see if there are any crontab
[events](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/events) that currently exist,
look in the following directory:

[PHP](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/php) evasion using character
reordering in 404 Not Found error; image courtesy of
[GBhackers](https://gbhackers.com/advanced-backdoor-obfuscation/)
If the target is not using a [Web Application
Firewall](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/web-application-firewall) (WAF)
then PHP evasion may be an option for an attacker. Hypertext
Preprocessor (PHP) is an [open
source](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/open-source), server-side,
[scripting](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/scripting)
[programming](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/programming) language
popular for its use in combination with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
and [Javascript](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/javascript) for dynamic
web pages and web applications. [Over 82% of
websites](https://www.imperva.com/blog/2018/07/the-trickster-hackers-backdoor-obfuscation-and-evasion-techniques/)
use some version of PHP. Using PHP evasion, an attacker can [reorder
characters to embed
a](https://gbhackers.com/advanced-backdoor-obfuscation/)
[backdoor](https://gbhackers.com/advanced-backdoor-obfuscation/) in the
[code](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/code) of website or web
application. Notice in the example image (above) that Line 1 turns off
any error [reporting](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/reporting) by
setting the value inside the parenthesis to "0." Line 3 is where the
command letter reordering occurs with the out-of-order "ps_ot." Line 4
then instructs it to reorder the letters to spell "\_POST." Lines 5--12
of the code instructs the program to verify the
[HTTP](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/http) request was performed using
the POST method and "eval" command to run "lequ" malware code without
the attacker ever typing the "POST" command and triggering an Event
alarm. Character reordering also works with \$\_POST, \$\_REQUEST,
\$\_FILES, and \$\_COOKIE superglobal arrays.
Other PHP [evasion
techniques](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/evasion-techniques) involve
string [manipulation](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/manipulation)
functions such as:
-   str_replace: replaces all occurrences of 1st string with the 2nd
    string in a string of 3 strings
-   str_rot13: shifts every letter by 13 places in the English alphabet
-   '.' [operator](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/operator): concatenates
    characters or strings
-   strrev: reverses a string
## Obfuscating Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
![](media/image114.jpeg)Credits:
[process.st](https://www.process.st/server-security/)
Obfuscation can mean different things to different people depending on
the context it is used in. Evasion and obfuscation are interrelated
within the [hacking](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/hacking) universe.
Obfuscation is generally defined as making something difficult to
understand or trace back to its origin once evasion has either failed or
is no longer an option. As one might imagine, there are several methods
of performing obfuscation that are limited only by imagination and
technological constraints.
Obfuscation is partly why accurate [cyber
attack](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cyber-attack) attribution to a
specific [threat actor](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/threat-actor) or
[APT](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/apt-group)
[group](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/apt-group) is often said to be a
guessing game. For example, there is a high probability that a skilled
attacker will know [how to](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/how-to) cover
their tracks and also knows that
[penetrating](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/penetrating) a system
located in another country or region and then pivoting laterally and
attacking another system based in an entirely different country or
region has the advantage of making it appear as though the attack
originated from somewhere it didn't. This is a form of obfuscation and
it is why
[intelligence](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/intelligence-agencies)
[agencies](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/intelligence-agencies) and
[cybersecurity](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cybersecurity) firms
cannot be too quick to point the finger at which nation is responsible
though it may appear to be so obvious.
If Israel, for example, wanted to make it appear as though Iranian
hackers broke into Saudi Arabia's [critical
infrastructure](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/critical-infrastructure)
systems and shut down all of their electrical power to spark a
[war](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/war) or retaliation, they could
[hack](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/hack) into Iranian systems and
launch the attacks from the compromised Iranian computer systems. Saudi
Arabia might then arrive at the conclusion that
[Iran](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/iran) was responsible, kicking off
kinetic [military](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/military) hostilities
as retribution. When Nation-state [cyber
threat](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cyber-threat) actors are involved
in these types of [cyber
warfare](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/cyber-warfare) or cyber
[espionage](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/espionage) activities,
anti-forensic
techniques such as erasure of system Event
[logs](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/logs) to obfuscate
[forensic](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/forensic) investigative
purposes should be a consideration and checked against to determine if
any logs are missing.
Though it is tempting, forget about disabling system Event logging or
purging the logs after successfully accessing a system. This is a rookie
n00b move and could be a costly mistake. Disabling or deleting Event
logs would be a clear indication to any network
[security](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/security-administrator)
[administrator](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/security-administrator)
that is paying attention that the system has been compromised. Not to
mention, it is an action sure to trip the alarm if a system has an
IDS/IPS deployed on the network or if Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) is
configured to alert the [system
administrator](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/system-administrator) of
such activity. It is important for Red Team
[pentesters](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/pentesters) to fully
understand how Event logging functions within the various types of
[operating](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/operating) systems and
database types. Windows is not equal to Linux which is not equal to Mac
[OSX](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/osx) and so forth.
An attacker may limit their espionage activities on a specific system to
a specific time window of say 4-to-8 hours and then erase only the event
log(s) for the time period they were inside the system. This might be
hard to notice for a security
[administrator](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/administrator) that is
responsible for hundreds if not thousands of systems. This is also why
Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM, pronounced "sim" with a
silent 'e') is vital to [network security
monitoring](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/network-security-monitoring)
for large organizations. Modifying or deleting event logs may not be
possible, however, if the event logs are configured to automatically be
stored externally at another
[location](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/location) either within the
network or an entirely different Cloud-Service
[Provider](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/provider) (C-SP) storage/backup
solution.
When conducting Red Team ops, it is generally best to behave like a
normal user to avoid detection. Think of the user environment and what
type [of business](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/business) activities
[users](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/users) might be typically involved
in. Creating a general user account on the system is one method of
laying low under the [radar](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/radar) and
accessing files to see what the system has. When performing actions that
require escalated privileges, perform actions at the lowest level
possible and then [login](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/login) as
[root](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/root-1) to selectively erase the
event [log](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/log) items (if possible). Keep
actions to a minimum when in
"God-mode" root-level to minimize 'noise' within the system that will
attract attention. In order to obfuscate the
[metadata](https://www.peerlyst.com/tags/metadata) associated with Event
logs, a tool such as *TimeStomp* can be utilized.

APT attacks are serious and sophisticated threats that are typically
targeted with primary intent being to gain access to a network or
machines to locate and copy specific data.

So, let's define together what is data exfiltration and what are their
different techniques.
Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of sensitive information
from a target's network to a location which a threat actor controls.
> ![](media/image115.jpeg)*Source: Trend Micro*
Data exfiltration is a part of the post-exploitation process is referred
also to data theft or data extrusion.
Exfiltration can be done by having physical access to the target machine
or remotely by using the attackers developed scripts.
-   There is no silver bullet solution to detect data exfiltration
## What does attacker want to collect?
-   Database systems
-   Source code repositories
-   Speciality systems
-   Personal financial information
-   Email and Communication
-   File shares and similar systems
-   Cryptographic keys and tokens
Top Data transports used for exfiltration are:
-   HTTPS: GET/POST/PUT methods
-   FTP: widely available
-   USB: the Storage device
-   DNS: TXT, A, CNAME, Records
-   Tor/I2P: Difficult to trace
-   SMTP: Attachments message body
