### Optimized Text

HOLMES is a system designed to execute each stage of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) analysis. It generates a high-level graph that provides a real-time summary of the attacker's steps. We evaluated HOLMES against nine real-world APT threats and deployed it as a real-time intrusion detection tool. The results show that HOLMES successfully detects APT campaigns with high precision and low false alarm rates.

### Appendix

#### Scenario-2: Trojan

This attack scenario (Fig. 19) begins with a user downloading a malicious file. The user then executes the file, which establishes a Command and Control (C&C) communication channel with the attacker's machine. The attacker launches a shell and executes information-gathering commands such as `hostname`, `whoami`, `ifconfig`, `netstat`, and `uname`. Finally, the attacker exfiltrates some secret files. This scenario is similar to the Drive-by Download scenario, except that the initial compromise occurs through a program downloaded by the user. Despite missing important events related to C&C communication (connect) and final cleanup (unlink) activity, HOLMES was able to flag this as an APT because the Threat score exceeded the threshold.
