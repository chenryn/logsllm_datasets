previously provided during the legitimate registration. This is
because the serving cell is unchanged. That is, the list of TACs
still does not include the victim UE’s spoofed TAC. Hence,
the victim UE repetitively carries out the TAU upon receiving
the SIB1 message from the attacker. Nokia reports [31] that
a UE generates approximately 45 service requests7 during a
peak busy hour. However, the signaling storm via the SigOver
attack induces a more signiﬁcant network trafﬁc, e.g., an at-
tacker is able to trigger an average of 25,200 TAUs per UE per

hour. Given that the number of signaling messages generated
through the TAU and service request is similar, the attacker
can generate more trafﬁc than that generated during a peak
hour by a factor of 560. This clearly demonstrates the signif-
icant impact of the signaling storm attack, which imposes a
heavy signaling load on the network and causes severe battery
drainage for the UE.
Boosted impact of Qualcomm chipset. A sustained signal-
ing storm attack requires the attacker to continually inject
SIB1 messages. However, the smartphones equipped with the
Qualcomm baseband (e.g., Galaxy S4/S8/S9, LG G2/G6/G7)
malfunctioned, thus generating TAUs indeﬁnitely after a sin-
gle SIB1 injection. In particular, the UE continued to perform
the TAU procedure, even after the attacker stopped injecting
SIB18. The malfunctioning UE exhibits a normal behavior to
the user, which indicates that the data/call service can be used
without disrupting the user. Although the malfunction can be
ﬁxed by setting the UE in airplane mode, the user is unlikely
to do so without noticing any problems. This indicates that the
attack is sustained, even with the low-cost efforts to further
strengthen its impact.
Infeasibility of the FBS or Rogue UEs. The signal storm
attack seems to be achievable with an FBS. However, the
injection of malicious SIB1 (containing the spoofed TAC) via
the FBS does not lead to the signaling storm attack. This is
because under the FBS, the TAU request from the victim UE
is directed to the FBS, instead of the legitimate LTE network.
In other words, the signals do not reach the LTE network;
thus, the signaling storm attack is inherently unachievable
for the FBS. Moreover, exploiting a number of rogue UEs
may induce the signaling storm on the network. However,
this approach is limited with respect to its scalability, wherein
it requires multiple radio devices and SIM-cards for each
device, to induce the same effect as the SigOver attack. On
8The root cause of this malfunctioning is the implementation logic of the
Qualcomm LTE chipset, which did not read the SIB1 after completing the
TAU. As a result, they could not recognize the legitimate SIB1 that contained
correct TAC, and the TAU was carried out until the legitimate SIB1 was
re-read.

that covers an entire cell and forces several authentic users
camping on the cell to initiate the TAU procedure.
5.1.2 Selective DoS through Access Barring
Attack mechanism. The cellular network has control over
the number of UEs that can access the network. This feature
is to manage the amount of trafﬁc and maintain the stability
of the network under speciﬁc conditions, e.g., a disaster. The
control is realized using the BarringFactor parameter in SIB2,
which is exploited by the SigOver attack to block the victim
UE. By setting BarringFactor as 0 (via overshadowing), an
attacker can restrict all data trafﬁc and signaling from the UE
(i.e., mobile originating)9, which leads to DoS.
Figure 10 presents the conﬁguration of the malicious SIB2
in the crafted subframe in comparison with the original SIB2
in a legitimate subframe. To maximize the impact of the at-
tack, the SigOver attack sets the BarringTime to 512s, which
is the maximum value as per the standard. Note that Bar-
ringTime can be refreshed if the attacker repeats the attack
within the remaining BarringTime; thus, a persistent DoS can
be achieved. To properly inject the crafted subframe (simi-
larly to the signaling storm), the attacker ﬁrst overshadows a
paging message with system_Info_Modification. Thereafter,
she overhears the legitimate SIB1 to extract the SFN, from
which the attacker can obtain the schedule of the next SIB2
for overshadowing. A potential extension of this attack is
service-speciﬁc DoS to selectively block only the targeted
services (e.g., voice call, video conference, and SMS). This
leverages a new service-speciﬁc barring feature introduced in
3GPP speciﬁcations [7].
Validation. This attack was validated using 10 different
smartphone models. Upon the successful SigOver attack
(i.e., injected paging and SIB2 are received); entire data ser-
vices, which include web browsing and video streaming were
blocked on all 10 devices. From the analysis of the device
logs, it was found that all the devices failed to initiate any con-
nection when applications made multiple connection requests.
This conﬁrms the feasibility of the barring via the SigOver at-
tack. Moreover, the service-speciﬁc DoS was validated using

owing the paging channel of the victim UE.

Comparison with the FBS. An FBS can also inject mali-
cious SIB2. However, the attack is only valid when the FBS is
turned on, and immediately stops when the FBS is turned off.
This is because the victim UE connects to the legitimate cell
shortly after disconnection from the FBS. During the connec-
tion to the legitimate cell, the victim UE reads the legitimate
SIB2, which recovers UE services. Conversely, the services
of the victim UE remain blocked after SigOver attack stops,
as this does not incur cell reselection. Furthermore, the FBS
cannot achieve the service-selective DoS, as it cannot provide
the LTE service.
5.2 Attacks Exploiting Paging
In this section, we present three attacks through the SigOver
attack on the paging message: DoS attack, network downgrad-
ing, and location tracking.
5.2.1 DoS Attack by Overshadowing Paging with IMSI
Attack mechanism. When the GUTI of the UE is unavail-
able, the network sends paging message with IMSI as an
identiﬁer of UE. As deﬁned in the 3GPP standards, upon re-
ceiving the paging that contains the IMSI, the UE terminates
all service sessions and initiates the registration procedure
using the IMSI as the identiﬁer [5]. This implies that the DoS
attack can be realized by injecting the paging message with
IMSI10. Speciﬁcally, the attacker injects a paging message
that contains the IMSI of the victim UE at the paging oc-
casion/frame of the victim UE. This attack detaches a UE
from the cellular network services, which include voice call
and data services, thus indicating a DoS at the UE. As the
registration procedure (which follows the service termination)
automatically recovers the services, the attack is sustained by
the repeated injection of the paging message.
Validation. This attack was validated using 10 different smart-
phone models in two different operation states (RRC Idle and
RRC Connected). Speciﬁcally, in the RRC Idle state, we con-
ﬁrmed that the UEs successfully received the overshadowed
paging message. Furthermore, the internal logs in the UEs
conﬁrmed the expected impact of the attack, i.e., detachment
from the network followed by the registration procedure, thus
leading to DoS.
For following experiment, we launched the attack on the
UE in the RRC Connected state. Note that the SigOver attack
enables the attacker to convey the crafted message to the UE
on the existing radio connection between the UE and the eNB.
We ﬁrst make a voice call on the victim UE to force the UE to
enter the RRC Connected state. We then transmitted the pag-
ing message with IMSI to the UE. Interestingly, we observed
that not all UEs handled the paging messages in the RRC Con-
nected state. In particular, the Samsung Galaxy S8/S9, LG
10Acquiring IMSI is extensively discussed in the previous work [11, 44]
G6/G7 (Qualcomm), Samsung Galaxy S8/S9 (Exynos), and
Apple iPhone XS (Intel) properly handled the paging mes-
sage with IMSI, after which the call was immediately aborted
(service termination). Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S6
(Exynos), and Galaxy S4, LG G2 (Qualcomm) did not respond
to the attack in the RRC Connected state.
The inconsistencies between the devices stem from the
ambiguity of the 3GPP standards. The mechanism used to
handle paging in the RRC Connected state is loosely deﬁned,
without speciﬁc direction on paging with IMSI, e.g., only in-
formation on paging with the system information notiﬁcation
or CMAS/ETWS [3] is provided. In summary, by injecting
the paging message with IMSI , the SigOver attack can realize
a DoS on the victim UE in RRC Idle and RRC Connected
states, depending on the device.
Comparison with the FBS. This attack scenario was exten-
sively discussed in the previous work [21, 35] leveraging
the FBS. Although the impact and the attack vectors are
equivalent, the applicability of the existing attacks is lim-
ited when compared with the SigOver attack. This is because
the SigOver attack uniquely enables the attacker to deliver
the paging message to the UE which has an active radio
connection with the network, whereas other works are only
applicable to UEs that use no services; thus indicating the
wider applicability of the SigOver attack.
5.2.2 Network Downgrading Attack via CS Paging
Attack mechanism. In this attack, an attacker injects a paging
message with a Circuit Switched (CS) notiﬁcation (with the
S-TMSI of the victim UE) to intentionally downgrade victim
UEs to the 3G network. Upon the reception of the CS paging,
the UE initiates the Circuit Switched Fall-Back process and
transits to the 3G network. That is, the SigOver attack enables
the attacker to force the UE to a slower connection.
Validation. We experimentally conﬁrmed that the victim UE
in the RRC Idle state immediately switched to the 3G network
when the attacker’s CS paging was received, after which it
soon reverted back to the LTE network because there was no
actual service in the 3G network. The attack was effective for
the state-of-the-art smartphones, e.g., the Samsung Galaxy
S8/S9, LG G6/G7 (Qualcomm), and Samsung Galaxy S8/S9
(Exynos), as they were able to respond the CS paging mes-
sage the both RRC Idle and RRC Connected states. However,
similar to the paging attack with IMSI, some smartphones did
not respond to the CS paging in the RRC Connected state,
and were therefore immune to the attack. Interestingly, when
the Samsung Galaxy S8 (Qualcomm) dropped to the 3G net-
work due to the attack, the LTE connection was never restored
while using data service.
Comparison with the existing attack. Tu et al. demon-
strated the throughput degradation attack against an victim UE
by invoking the CS paging, which is similar to our attack [47].
However, in this study, the network was driven to send the
paging message on behalf of the attacker, by establishing a
USENIX Association
28th USENIX Security Symposium    65
call with the UE in the 3G network. It should be noted that, in
the SigOver attack, the paging message is directly transmitted
by the attacker. This attack inherently exposes the attacker’s
phone number, thus making the attack easily detectable by the
operator. In comparison, the SigOver attack silently transmits
the CS paging to the victim UE. Furthermore, the existing
work cannot downgrade the victim UEs in the RRC Connected
state to the 3G network, since the network does not send a
paging message to the victim UE in the RRC Connected state;
whereas the SigOver attack can deliver the paging message.
5.2.3 Coarse-grained Tracking of a UE
Attack mechanism. As explained in Section 2, following the
completion of the RA procedure, the UE attempts to estab-
lish an RRC connection by sending a Connection request
(containing UE identity) to the cell. If the UE holds the previ-
ously assigned temporary identity (i.e., S-TMSI), this identity
is included in the Connection request as well. Otherwise, a
random value is selected. Upon the receipt of the UE’s request,
the cell replies with the Connection setup that contains the
UE’s identity (the S-TMSI or the random value). By checking
this identity, each UE is able to recognize if its RA procedure
was successful. If the procedure fails, the UE retries the RA
procedure. The abovementioned procedure used to resolve
connection conﬂicts is referred to as a contention resolution.
In this attack, an attacker exploits the contention resolution
technique to perform coarse-grained location tracking of the
target victim. First, the attacker with the knowledge of the
S-TMSI of the victim UE injects a paging message with the
S-TMSI11. The attacker then eavesdrops on the Connection
setup messages transmitted from the legitimate cell12. When
the Connection setup message that contains the S-TMSI of
the victim UE is received, the attacker conﬁrms that the victim
UE resides within the coverage of the cell by snifﬁng the
downlink messages.
Validation. We validated this attack using all the smartphone
models in this work. We conﬁrmed that the attacker is able to
identify the presence of the victim UE by injecting a single
paging message and eavesdropping on the Connection setup
message sent to the victim UE.
Comparison with the FBS. An FBS can achieve the same
results by monitoring the IMSI in Identity Response mes-
sage. However, the FBS requires an active connection to the
target victim to transmit the message. Therefore, the attack
is limited by the FBS with respect to its stealthiness and
power efﬁciency. In a previous study, it was reported that
RNTI-TMSI mapping can be applied to passively monitor the
victim’s TMSI [37]; however, the SigOver attack provides an
active method by which the victim can be located.
11Due to the space limit, a detailed discussion on how an attacker acquires
the S-TMSI of the target UE was omitted. However, this has been extensively
investigated in previous studies [19, 22, 23, 37].
12Since the RRC connection procedure is not encrypted, the attacker can
eavesdrop on any downlink messages during the connection procedure of the
UEs.
6 Defending Against SigOver Attack
In this section, we present an outline of two possible defense
strategies against the SigOver attack. We start the feasibility
of the fundamental solution as a prevention measure, in which
all the broadcast signals were digitally signed by adopting the
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). We then discuss a short-term
solution for the detecting SigOver attack, which leverages the
changing nature of the physical signal during the processing
of the overshadowing signal.
6.1 Digitally Signing Broadcast Messages
As the SigOver attack exploits the lack of integrity protection
in broadcast messages, one natural defense against SigOver
attack is to employ integrity protection in the messages using
a digital signature scheme. For this, each base station needs
to have a certiﬁcate issued by its operator and a UE needs to
be provisioned with a root certiﬁcate (e.g., self-signed one
by the operator) to verify the certiﬁcate of the base station.
However, this natural defense has at least several deployment
and technical challenges.
Deployment challenges: In 5G, the 3GPP introduced a pub-
lic key encryption for IMSI in the initial registration, to pro-
vide privacy protection for the permanent identiﬁer. For this,
each UE is provisioned with its home operator public key,
thereby it was assumed that a public key provisioning mech-
anism to the UE is in place. This provisioning mechanism
could also be used to provision a public key (or a signing
certiﬁcate) for base station certiﬁcate veriﬁcation. However,
in roaming scenarios, the UE need to acquire the public key
of the visited network operator, which is trusted by the home
operator. This essentially requires a PKI for the global cel-
lular networks that span the world and non-trivial trust rela-
tionships among multiple operators in different jurisdictions.
Furthermore, managing certiﬁcate revocation lists are another
obvious burden.
Technical challenges: Signing every single broadcast mes-
sage may incur a substantial computational overhead at the
base station, considering the low periodicity of essential broad-
cast messages such as MIB (40ms) and SIB1/2 (80ms). Fur-
thermore, message size increases due to the signature and
certiﬁcate broadcasting (e.g., using a new SIB) would result
in a higher power consumption at the base station. Similarly,
from UE’s perspective, verifying certiﬁcate and signature
would require additional power consumption, resulting in a
faster battery drain. Such a power consumption may be pro-
hibitive to low-power Internet of Things devices that need to
survive many years without battery replacements.
An ID-Based Signature scheme (IBS) [9, 41] can be con-
sidered as a cost-effective alternative, as it has substantially
low key management overhead and eliminates the certiﬁcate
broadcast and veriﬁcation overhead. However, the IBS re-
quires UEs to get synchronized with the public parameters
