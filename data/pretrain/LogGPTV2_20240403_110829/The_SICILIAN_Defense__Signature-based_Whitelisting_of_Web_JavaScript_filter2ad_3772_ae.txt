### 4. Decision Process for Script Changes
When a script change is detected, the system must determine whether the changes are legitimate. If the changes are deemed illegitimate, the system can block the injection attempt and notify the third-party script provider about the modifications. If the changes are legitimate, the administrator can update the corresponding value in the whitelist database.

### 5. Evaluation
In this section, we present an empirical analysis of our 3-month measurement study (from January 31, 2015, to April 30, 2015) on Alexa's top 500 sites and 15 popular PHP applications (see Table 1). Our goals are as follows:
1. Determine the practicality of raw signatures for scripts on Alexa's top 500 websites and popular PHP applications.
2. Demonstrate that our signature scheme and policies, as defined in Section 3, are easy to implement and expressive enough to whitelist benign scripts on these top websites.
3. Show that structural signatures reduce false positives compared to raw signatures.
4. Prove that our approach incurs only a small performance overhead on the browser.

#### Implementation
We implemented SICILIAN by modifying Chromium version 43.0.2315, an open-source version of Google Chrome. We added a module to Chromium's JavaScript engine by inserting 133 lines of C code across two files: `SubresourceIntegrity.cpp` and `ScriptLoader.cpp`. Additionally, we included a helper file, `struct_signature.h`, which contains 659 kB of JavaScript code to generate an AST tree of a script and compute structural signatures.

#### Platform
All experiments were conducted using Chromium v43 on a Dell Latitude 6430u host, configured with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3687U 2.10GHz CPU and 8GB RAM, running 64-bit Ubuntu Linux 14. We used Ninja v.1.5.1 for compiling the modified Chromium browser.

### 5.1 Insufficiency of Raw Signatures
Our study of Alexa's top 500 websites revealed that none of these sites employ signature checking on their script resources, likely due to the deployment burden of frequently updating signatures for highly dynamic scripts. To support this, we crawled 45,066 webpages, logging 33,302 scripts from Alexa's top 500, and recorded their changes over 3 months starting January 31, 2015. Each script was visited an average of 52 times, resulting in approximately 17 visits per month. We introduced a metric called **Update Frequency (UF)**, which measures how often a script's signature changes per visit. The UF for raw signatures is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{UF}_{\text{Raw}} = \frac{\text{Number of times the raw signature changes}}{\text{Number of visits to the script}} \]

Figure 6 summarizes the UF results for Alexa's top 500 domains, showing the sorted maximum and average UF values. In the figure, 59 error domains were assumed to have both maximum and average UF = 0. Over 300 domains have an average UF > 0, indicating at least one script change. The maxUF plot shows that almost 200 domains have at least one script with UF = 1, meaning the script changes with every visit. Imposing raw signatures via SRI on such scripts would require developers to update the signature for each request, which is impractical in real-world settings.

**Deployability of Raw Signatures:**
We found that 30,989 static scripts account for approximately 93% of all crawled scripts. However, only 69 websites (13.8%) of Alexa's top 500 and 7 out of 15 PHP apps can be fully retrofitted to a raw signature-based solution because only these sites have all scripts remain static. Thus, raw signatures have limited practical adoption, answering our RQ1.

### 5.2 Quantitative Analysis of SICILIAN
**Deployability of SICILIAN:**
We found that 33,094 scripts (approximately 99.4% of all crawled scripts) can be whitelisted using SICILIAN. Among the Alexa's top 500 sites and 15 PHP applications, SICILIAN can be fully applied to 372 websites and all 15 PHP apps. This means all scripts imported by these sites and apps fall into the C1, C2, or C3A categories of script changes. For these 372 domains, the average UFStruct is 0.057, equivalent to 1 whitelist update per month. Excluding 59 error domains, this accounts for 84.7% of all crawled websites. SICILIAN covers five times more domains than SRI (69 websites), a raw signature-based whitelisting solution. Our approach also works on popular and highly dynamic websites such as Google, eBay, and Amazon.

\[ \text{UF}_{\text{Struct}} = \frac{\text{Number of times the structural signature changes}}{\text{Number of visits to the script}} \]

**Rate of Signature Updates:**
We compared the rate of script signature updates for raw and structural signatures using their update frequencies (Equation 7 & 8). Figure 7 shows the variation of the update frequency for Alexa's 500 domains, sorted according to UF values. Of the 500 domains, 59 were excluded due to errors. Of the 441 remaining websites, 153 and 334 domains had an UF ≤ 0.1 for raw and structural signatures, respectively. This implies that our signature mechanism works for 334 websites, assuming an update frequency less than 0.1 (5 times in our 3-month measurement). In contrast, SRI is applicable to only 153 sites with such an update rate. Each signature update in SRI requires changing all integrity attributes on all parent web pages, whereas in our approach, only one update is required in the server-side database. Further, the number of domains increases to 433 (98% of all non-error domains) for UF ≤ 0.5, compared to 314 domains for raw signatures. Thus, structural signatures significantly reduce the update frequency of Alexa's top 500 sites. On average, the UF of structural signatures (µS = 0.075) is four times smaller than the average UF for raw signatures (µR = 0.28) (Figure 7).

**Time-Related Changes:**
We classified our crawled scripts into the categories defined in Section 3.2 and summarized the results in Figure 8. As seen from the figure, 71.07% of the changes belong to C1 ∪ C2, with 4% falling into both C1 and C2. Scripts in C2 (50%) are the majority of changes, making C2 a common practice in Alexa's websites (271 domains). If site administrators wish to impose raw signatures on C1 and C2 scripts, they need to extensively rewrite server code, making such changes not easily fixable. Structural signatures, however, can robustly handle these changes without imposing a burden on the admin. C3A contributes significantly (20%) to the changes, affecting 247 domains, suggesting that developers regularly maintain their codebase. Scripts in C3A have very small UFs (0.066 on average), equivalent to approximately three script updates during our 3-month crawling period, given an average of 52 script visits. Therefore, although such scripts are significant and affect many domains, the effort of updating their signatures is relatively low (once a month).

Finally, we found that scripts in C3B are highly dynamic and cannot be whitelisted with any kind of signature schemes due to their high UFs (0.652 on average). Such highly dynamic scripts include advertisements with customized scripts or scripts from news websites. However, such "non-static" scripts are scarce (0.62% of all crawled scripts) and used only in 69 domains. These domains can be retrofitted to SICILIAN by placing the C3B scripts into separate iframe containers, as done in [4]. Such modification requires additional development effort but may be feasible given the small number of C3B scripts.
