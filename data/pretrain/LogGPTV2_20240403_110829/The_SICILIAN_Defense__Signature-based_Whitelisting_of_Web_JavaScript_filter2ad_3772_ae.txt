decide whether such changes are legitimate, or it can block the
inject attempt and contact the third-party script provider about
the script changes.
If the changes are indeed legitimate, the
admin can update their value in the whitelist database.
5. EVALUATION
In this section, we give an empirical analysis of our 3-month long
measurement study (from 31st January 2015 to 30th April 2015) on
Alexa’s top 500 sites and 15 popular PHP applications (see Table 1)
with the following goals. First, we would like to determine whether
raw signatures are practical for scripts in Alexa’s top 500 websites
and popular PHP apps. Second, we show that our signature scheme
and policies deﬁned in Section 3 are easy to implement and expres-
sive enough to whitelist benign scripts on Alexa’s top websites.
Further, structural signatures are able to reduce false positives as
compared to raw signatures. Lastly, we show that our approach
incurs only a small performance overhead on the browser.

Implementation. We implement SICILIAN by modifying Chro-
mium version 43.0.2315, an open source version of Google Chrome.
We implemented a module which can be patched to the Chromium’s
JavaScript engine by adding 133 lines of C code spreading over two
ﬁles in the codebase, namely SubresourceIntegrity.cpp
and ScriptLoader.cpp. In addition, we included a helper ﬁle
struct_signature.h in which we embedded 659 kB of Java-

Figure 6: The ﬁgure represents the variation of average and maximum of
update frequencies of all scripts of a domain across Alexa’s top 500 sites,
sorted in descending order of their update frequencies. The graph is based
on a U Fraw metric, which indicates how often raw signatures are updated
for a number of visits.

Platform. All experiments were conducted in Chromium v43 set
up on a Dell Latitude 6430u host, conﬁgured with Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-3687U 2.10GHz CPU and 8GB RAM running 64-bit Ubuntu
Linux 14. We use Ninja v.1.5.1 for compiling our modiﬁed Chro-
mium browser.
5.1 Insufﬁciency of Raw Signatures
Our study on the Alexa’s top 500 websites shows that none of
these popular websites employ signature checking on their script
resources, which we suspect is due to the deployability burden in
retroﬁtting such mechanisms. The burden is caused by the highly
dynamic scripts which require developers to frequently update the
signatures. To justify this claim, we crawl for 45066 webpages log-
ging 33,302 scripts from Alexa’s top 500 and record their changes
periodically over 3-months starting 31st January 2015. Each script
was visited 52 times on average in our experiments, giving an aver-
age of 17 visits per month. Therefore, every website has an average
of 17 visits per script per month. We introduce a metric called up-
date frequency (UF), which measures how often a script’s signature
changes per visit. Note that change in script’s signature implies that
the content of the script itself has changed. Update frequency for
raw signature is calculated as follows:
U FRaw =
# times the raw signature changes
# visits to the script
(7)
Our result on Update Frequency (UF) in Alexa’s top 500 web-
sites is summarized in Figure 6, which shows the sorted version of
maximum and average UF of scripts in Alexa’s top 500 domains. In
the ﬁgure, 59 error domains were assumed to have both maximum
and average UF = 0. As seen from the ﬁgure, 300+ domains have
an average UF > 0 which suggests that these domains have at least
one script that changes. We further observe from the maxUF plot
that there are almost 200 domains which have at least one script
with UF = 1, i.e., this script keeps changing for every visit. If raw
signatures via SRI are to be imposed on websites with such scripts,
the developer needs to undertake the burden of updating the signa-
ture of the script for each request — which is not practical in real
world settings.
Deployability of Raw Signatures. We investigate the number of
scripts on which raw signature based solutions (e.g., SRI, BEEP [29])
can be fully applied. As mentioned earlier, we ﬁnd 30,989 static
scripts which accounts for approximately 93% of all the scripts that
we have crawled. However, only 69 websites of the Alexa’s top
500 (13.8%) and 7 out of 15 PHP apps can be fully retroﬁtted to
raw signature-based solution because only on these sites do all the
1552scripts remain static. Thus, raw signatures have limited practical
adoption thereby answers our RQ1.
5.2 Quantitative Analysis of SICILIAN
Deployability of SICILIAN. We ﬁnd that 33,094 scripts can be
whitelisted using SICILIAN, which are approximately 99.4% of all
the scripts that we have crawled. Among the Alexa’s top 500 sites
and 15 PHP applications that we have analyzed, SICILIAN can be
fully applied to 372 websites and 15 PHP apps. This means that all
the scripts imported by these websites and apps fall either in the C1,
C2, or C3A category of script changes. By Equation 8 for these 372
domains, we get an average UFStruct of 0.057. This is equivalent
to 1 whitelist update4 per month. Given that 59 of them were not
visited due to errors on the websites, this accounts for 84.7%5 of
all websites we crawled. SICILIAN covers ﬁve times more domains
than SRI (69 websites), which is a raw signature-based whitelisting
solution. Our approach also works on popular and highly-dynamic
websites such as Google, Ebay, and Amazon.
U FStruct =
# times the structural signature changes
# visits to the script
(8)
Rate of Signature Updates. We compare the rate of script sig-
nature updates of raw and structural signatures by comparing their
update frequencies (Equation 7&8). Figure 7 shows the variation
of the update frequency of raw and structural signatures among
Alexa’s 500 domains, sorted according to UF values. Of the 500
domains, 59 domains are excluded from the ﬁgure as these sites ei-
ther returned no HTML or had at least one DNS error (unreachable)
in our crawl. Of the 441 websites, there are 153 and 334 domains
with an UF ≤ 0.1 for raw signatures and structural signatures, re-
spectively. This implies that our signature mechanism works for
334 websites, assuming that their update frequency is lesser than
0.1 (5 times in our 3 month measurement6). In contrast, SRI is only
applicable to 153 of the sites with such an update rate. We point out
that each signature update in SRI requires changing all integrity at-
tributes on all parent web pages, whereas in our approach only one
update is required in the server-side database. Further, the num-
ber of domains increases to 433 (98% of all non-error domains) for
UF ≤ 0.5 as compared to 314 domains of raw signatures. Thus,
structural signatures signiﬁcantly reduce the update frequency of
Alexa’s top 500 sites. On average, the UF of structural signatures
(µS = 0.075) is four times smaller than the average UF for raw
signatures (µR = 0.28) (Figure 7).
Time-related Changes. We classify our crawled scripts into cate-
gories deﬁned in Section 3.2 and summarize the result in Figure 8.
As seen from the ﬁgure, 71.07% of the changes in the scripts be-
long to C1 union C2 and 4% of them fall in both C1 and C2. Scripts
belonging to C2 are the majority of the changes (46%+4% = 50%)
and thus C2 is a common practice in Alexa’s websites (271 do-
mains). If site admin wishes to impose raw signatures on scripts in
C1 and C2, she needs to extensively rewrite server code to retro-
ﬁt to raw signatures. Therefore, such script changes are not easily
ﬁxable. As opposed to raw signatures, structural signatures can
robustly handle them without enforcing any burden on the admin.
Further, C3A contributes signiﬁcantly (20%) to the changes and
affects 247 domains, which suggests that developers regularly main-
40.057*17, given an average of 17 script visits per month per domain.
5This is obtained from (372/(500-59))*100%
6Out of the 372 websites on which Sicilian can be fully applied, 334 require an at most
5 whitelist updates in 3 months while the remaining 38 require an at most 5 whitelist
updates in 2 months. Of the 334 sites, majority of the sites (243) require an at most
of 1 whitelist update per month. Together all 372 sites give an average of 1 whitelist
update per month due to an average UF = 0.057.

tain their site’s codebase. Scripts in C3A, however, have very small
UFs (0.066 on average). This is equivalent to approximately three
script updates during our 3-month crawling period, given an aver-
age of 52 script visits. Therefore, although such scripts are signif-
icant and affect many domains, the effort of updating their signa-
tures is relatively low (once a month).
Finally, we ﬁnd that scripts in C3B are highly dynamic, and can-
not be whitelisted with any kind of signature schemes due to their
high UFs (0.652 on average). Such highly dynamic scripts include
advertisements with customized scripts [28] or scripts from news
websites. However, such "non-static" scripts are scarce (0.62%)
with respect to all the crawled scripts and used only in 69 domains.
These domains can be retroﬁtted to SICILIAN by placing the C3B
scripts into separate iframe container, as done in [4]. Such mod-
iﬁcation requires additional development effort, but it may be fea-
sible given the small number of C3B scripts.
