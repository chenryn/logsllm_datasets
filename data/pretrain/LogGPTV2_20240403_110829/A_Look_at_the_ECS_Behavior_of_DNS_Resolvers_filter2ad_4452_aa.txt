## Abstract
Content delivery networks (CDNs) often use the Domain Name System (DNS) to map end-users to the most suitable edge servers. The recently proposed EDNS0-Client-Subnet (ECS) extension allows recursive resolvers to include end-user subnet information in DNS queries, enabling authoritative DNS servers, especially those operated by CDNs, to improve user mapping. This paper examines the ECS behavior of ECS-enabled recursive resolvers from the perspectives of both authoritative DNS servers and a busy DNS resolution service. We identify a range of erroneous and detrimental behaviors that can compromise client privacy, reduce the effectiveness of DNS caching, diminish ECS benefits, and, in some cases, hinder the ability of authoritative DNS servers to optimize user-to-edge-server mappings.

## 1. Introduction
In addition to resolving hostnames to IP addresses, the Domain Name System (DNS) is widely used by major content delivery networks (CDNs) [2, 7, 17] to assign end-users to the nearest edge servers. Since the only topological information available to authoritative nameservers in a basic DNS query is the source IP address (which belongs to the recursive DNS resolver rather than the end-user), many CDNs use the resolver's IP address as a proxy for the end-user's location. However, the increasing number of public DNS services, which are less likely to be a good approximation of end-user locations compared to ISP-provided resolvers, has led to an increase in suboptimal user-to-edge server mappings [1, 6, 19].

To address this issue, the EDNS-Client-Subnet (ECS) [9] extension was proposed, allowing recursive resolvers to convey a prefix of the client's IP address (loosely referred to as the client's subnet) to authoritative nameservers. This enables authoritative DNS servers to tailor their responses based on the client's subnet, rather than the resolver's IP address.

Recursive resolvers add the ECS option to DNS queries, including a prefix of the client's address (the RFC recommends 24 bits for IPv4) and setting the source prefix length field to the number of bits added. Authoritative nameservers that support ECS can use this information to tailor their responses. If the source prefix length is not at the appropriate granularity, the authoritative nameserver returns the scope prefix length in the ECS option, indicating the range of client IP addresses for which the response is valid. For example, if a recursive resolver sends queries with a source prefix length of 24 but the authoritative answer is appropriate for all clients within the /16 prefix, the authoritative nameserver sets the scope prefix length to 16. The recursive resolver then caches the records and returns them for the duration of the TTL to any clients covered by the prefix at the scope prefix length.

Although ECS was proposed in 2012 and standardized in 2016 [9], little is known about its adoption by recursive resolvers. Despite low absolute numbers, ECS is a crucial technology enabling efficient interaction between third-party DNS resolution services and CDNs. In this work, we investigate the ECS-related behavior of recursive resolvers and make the following contributions:

- **ECS Deployment Analysis:** We analyze ECS deployment by recursive resolvers through passive observations from a large CDN perspective and active scans. Passive observation reveals more ECS resolvers, while actively discovered resolvers allow a closer study of their behavior.
- **Probing Strategies:** We examine the probing strategies used by recursive resolvers to decide whether to include the ECS option in their queries. Some strategies lead to unnecessary privacy leakage and suboptimal CDN edge server selections. We offer a recommendation to fulfill the probing purpose without these drawbacks.
- **Caching Behavior:** We evaluate the caching behavior of ECS-supporting recursive resolvers. We find deviations from the expected behavior, ranging from exposing more than 24 bits of the client subnet information to ignoring scope restrictions when reusing cached DNS responses.
- **Impact on DNS Caching:** We study the impact of ECS on DNS caching, specifically the amount of cached state and cache hit rate. ECS limits the reuse of cached records across client subnets, leading to significant increases in cache size and decreases in cache hit rates.
- **Real-World Issues:** We provide cautionary tales of real-life setups that may diminish or negate ECS benefits, turning ECS into an obstacle for effective user-to-edge-server mappings.
- **Hidden Resolvers:** We discover and provide an initial glimpse into hidden resolvers, previously believed to be unobservable. Some hidden resolvers are far from the clients and can negatively impact ECS-based user-to-edge-server mappings.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 introduces the terminology, Section 4 describes the datasets, and Sections 5-8 expand on each contribution. Finally, Section 10 offers concluding thoughts.

## 2. Related Work
Several studies have investigated ECS from different perspectives. Chen et al. [6] studied the impact of ECS on mapping end-users to edge servers from Akamai’s perspective, showing a 50% improvement in latencies at the cost of an 8-fold increase in DNS queries. Calder et al. [5] examined ECS adoption by recursive resolvers from a cloud provider's perspective. Kintis et al. [21] discussed the privacy and security implications of ECS, including the erosion of privacy and the facilitation of selective cache-poisoning attacks. Vries et al. [12] analyzed 2.5 years of passive ECS-enabled queries to Google Public DNS, uncovering new privacy risks. Our work focuses on the ECS behavior of recursive resolvers and its implications for DNS caching and user-to-edge-server mappings.

## 3. Terminology
- **ECS Queries:** DNS queries that include an ECS option.
- **ECS Responses:** DNS responses with an ECS option.
- **Egress Resolvers:** Resolvers that directly interact with authoritative nameservers.
- **Ingress Resolvers:** Resolvers that receive queries directly from user devices and often act as forwarders, forwarding queries to egress resolvers.
- **Hidden Resolvers:** Intermediaries between ingress and egress resolvers, previously thought to be unobservable.

## 4. Datasets
We consider four datasets:
- **CDN Dataset:** One day of DNS traffic logs from a major CDN’s authoritative DNS servers, containing 1.5B queries, including 847M with an ECS option.
- **Scan Dataset:** Queries from a full DNS scan of the IPv4 address space, identifying 2.743M open ingress resolvers, with 1.53M using ECS-enabled egress resolvers.
- **Public Resolver/CDN Dataset:** DNS traffic logs from a major CDN’s authoritative nameservers for ECS queries from a major public DNS service, covering 3.8B queries.
- **All-Names Resolver Dataset:** DNS traffic from a busy recursive resolver instance of an anycast DNS resolution service.

These datasets provide a comprehensive view of ECS behavior and its impact on DNS operations.
