### Displaying Log Files on the Routing Engine

The following examples demonstrate how to display the `/var/log/messages` file stored on the Routing Engine in slot 1:

```shell
user@host> show log re1:messages
user@host> file show re1:/var/log/messages
```

For detailed information about the fields in a log message, refer to the following sections:
- **Interpreting Messages Generated in Standard Format by a Junos OS Process or Library**
- **Interpreting Messages Generated in Standard Format by Services on a PIC**
- **Interpreting Messages Generated in Structured-Data Format**

#### Sample Content from Log Files

This section includes sample content from the `/var/log` directory. You can view the contents of the `/var/log/messages` file stored on the local Routing Engine. The `/var/log` directory is the default location for log files, so you do not need to include it in the filename. The `messages` file is a common destination for system log messages.

**Note:** In Junos OS Evolved, the `messages` file is only written on the primary Routing Engine. Backup Routing Engine messages are found in the `messages` file on the primary Routing Engine.

Example log entries:

```shell
user@host> show log messages
Apr 11 10:27:25 router1 mgd[3606]: UI_DBASE_LOGIN_EVENT: User 'barbara' entering configuration mode
Apr 11 10:32:22 router1 mgd[3606]: UI_DBASE_LOGOUT_EVENT: User 'barbara' exiting configuration mode
Apr 11 11:36:15 router1 mgd[3606]: UI_COMMIT: User 'root' performed commit: no comment
Apr 11 11:46:37 router1 mib2d[2905]: SNMP_TRAP_LINK_DOWN: ifIndex 82, ifAdminStatus up(1), ifOperStatus down(2), ifName at-1/0/0
```

You can also display the contents of the `/var/log/processes` file, which is configured to include messages from the daemon facility. When using the `file show` command, specify the full pathname of the file:

```shell
user@host> file show /var/log/processes
Feb 22 08:58:24 router1 snmpd[359]: SNMPD_TRAP_WARM_START: trap_generate_warm: SNMP trap: warm start
Feb 22 20:35:07 router1 snmpd[359]: SNMPD_THROTTLE_QUEUE_DRAINED: trap_throttle_timer_handler: cleared all throttled traps
Feb 23 07:34:56 router1 snmpd[359]: SNMPD_TRAP_WARM_START: trap_generate_warm: SNMP trap: warm start
Feb 23 07:38:19 router1 snmpd[359]: SNMPD_TRAP_COLD_START: trap_generate_cold: SNMP trap: cold start
```

If the `explicit-priority` statement is included at the `[edit system syslog file processes]` hierarchy level, the log entries will include priority levels:

```shell
user@host> file show /var/log/processes
Feb 22 08:58:24 router1 snmpd[359]: %DAEMON-3-SNMPD_TRAP_WARM_START: trap_generate_warm: SNMP trap: warm start
Feb 22 20:35:07 router1 snmpd[359]: %DAEMON-6-SNMPD_THROTTLE_QUEUE_DRAINED: trap_throttle_timer_handler: cleared all throttled traps
Feb 23 07:34:56 router1 snmpd[359]: %DAEMON-3-SNMPD_TRAP_WARM_START: trap_generate_warm: SNMP trap: warm start
Feb 23 07:38:19 router1 snmpd[359]: %DAEMON-2-SNMPD_TRAP_COLD_START: trap_generate_cold: SNMP trap: cold start
```

### Throughput Overuse Warning Messages

The SRX4100 device supports up to 20 Gbps and 7 Mpps of Internet mix (IMIX) firewall performance. If IMIX throughput exceeds these limits, new log messages are generated to alert you of the overuse. Example log messages:

```shell
user@host> show log messages
Apr 25 14:01:12 user Throughput exceed 20Gbps and 7Mpps in 35% of last 15 minutes, above the time threshold 10%!
Apr 25 14:16:12 user Throughput exceed 20Gbps and 7Mpps in 95% of last 15 minutes, above the time threshold 10%!
```

Every 15 minutes, the system calculates the duration during which the throughput has exceeded 20 Gbps and 7 Mpps. A log message is triggered if the throughput exceeds more than 1 minute, 30 seconds (10%) of the last 15 minutes. For example:

```shell
Throughput exceed 20 Gbps and 7 Mpps in 35% of last 15 minutes, above the time threshold 10%!
```

This means that the throughput has exceeded 20 Gbps and 7 Mpps for 5 minutes, 15 seconds of the last 15 minutes (35% of 15 minutes).

To disable these log messages, reduce the throughput below 20 Gbps and 7 Mpps or install an enhanced performance upgrade license.

**Note:** This feature requires a license. Refer to the Juniper Licensing Guide for general information about License Management. For details, see the product Data Sheets at SRX Series Services Gateways or contact your Juniper Account Team or Juniper Partner.

### Displaying Log Files from a Routing Matrix

To display a log file stored on the local Routing Engine of any platform in a routing matrix (T640 routing nodes or TX Matrix platform), log in to a Routing Engine on the platform, enter Junos OS CLI operational mode, and use the `show log` or `file show` command as described in "Displaying a Log File from a Single-Chassis System" on page 1326.

To display a log file stored on a T640 routing node during a terminal session on the TX Matrix platform, add a prefix that specifies the T640 routing nodeâ€™s LCC index number (0 through 3):

```shell
user@host> show log lccn:log-filename
user@host> file show lccn:log-file-pathname
```

By default, the `show log` and `file show` commands display the specified log file stored on the primary Routing Engine on the T640 routing node. To display the log from a specific Routing Engine, prefix the file- or pathname with `lccn-primary`, `lccn-re0`, or `lccn-re1`:

```shell
user@host> show log lcc2:messages
user@host> show log lcc2-master:messages
user@host> show log lcc2-re0:messages
user@host> file show lcc2:/var/log/messages
```

If the T640 routing nodes are forwarding messages to the TX Matrix platform (as in the default configuration), you can view messages generated on a T640 routing node by displaying a local log file. However, the messages will be intermixed with messages from other T640 routing nodes and the TX Matrix platform itself. For more information, see "Impact of Different Local and Forwarded Severity Levels on System Log Messages on a TX Matrix Router" on page 1296.

### MD5 Log Files

Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved BGP support authentication for protocol exchanges. When you configure TCP Message Digest 5 (MD5) authentication for BGP on neighboring routing devices, the following log warning messages are stored in `/var/log/messages`:

**On Junos OS:**

- **MD5 configured on local but not on peer device:**
  ```shell
  Apr 16 21:49:52 R1_re kernel: tcp_auth_ok: Packet from 2.2.2.2:52848 missing MD5 digest
  ```

- **MD5 configured on peer but not on local device:**
  ```shell
  Apr 16 21:51:30 R1_re kernel: tcp_auth_ok: Packet from 2.2.2.2:54049 unexpectedly has MD5 digest
  ```

- **MD5 configured on both routers with authentication password mismatch:**
  ```shell
  Apr 16 21:51:58 R1_re kernel: tcp_auth_ok: Packet from 2.2.2.2:54049 wrong MD5 digest
  ```

**On Junos OS Evolved:**

- **TCP MD5 authentication configured on local but not on peer device:**
  - No log messages are available.

- **TCP MD5 authentication configured on peer but not on local device:**
  - No log messages are available.

- **MD5 configured on both routers with authentication password mismatch:**
  ```shell
  Apr 16 21:41:22 vScapa1-RE0-re0 kernel: %KERN-6-TCP: MD5 Hash failed for (2.2.2.2, 39213)->(1.1.1.1, 179)
  ```

### Configuring System Logging for Security Devices

#### System Logging Overview for Security Devices

**Control Plane and Data Plane Logs:**

- **Control Plane Logs (System Logs):** These logs include events that occur on the routing platform. Control plane events are sent to the `eventd` process on the Routing Engine, which handles them using Junos OS policies, generating system log messages, or both. You can send control plane logs to a file, user terminal, routing platform console, or remote machine. Use the `syslog` statement at the `[system]` hierarchy level to generate control plane logs.
- **Data Plane Logs (Security Logs):** These logs primarily include security events handled inside the data plane. Security logs can be in text or binary format and can be saved locally (event mode) or sent to an external server (stream mode). Binary format is required for stream mode and recommended to conserve log space in event mode.

**Note:**
- Security logs can be saved locally (on-box) or externally (off-box), but not both.
- SRX1400, SRX1500, SRX3400, SRX3600, SRX4100, SRX4200, SRX4600, SRX5400, SRX5600, and SRX5800 devices default to stream mode. To specify binary format and an external server, see "Configuring Off-Box Binary Security Log Files" on page 1354.
- Starting with Junos OS Release 15.1X49-D100, the default mode for SRX1500 is stream mode. Prior to this release, the default mode was event mode.
- Starting in Junos OS Release 18.3R3, the default logging mode for SRX300, SRX320, SRX340, SRX345, SRX550, and SRX550M devices is stream mode. Data plane events are written to system log files in a similar manner to control plane events. To specify binary format for the security logs, see "Configuring Off-Box Binary Security Log Files" on page 1354.

**Redundant System Log Server:**

Security system logging traffic intended for remote servers is sent through network interface ports, which support two simultaneous system log destinations. Each system logging destination must be configured separately. When two system log destination addresses are configured, identical logs are sent to both destinations. Adding a second destination is primarily useful as a redundant backup for standalone and active/backup configured chassis cluster deployments.

**Binary Format for Security Logs:**

Junos OS generates separate log messages for events on the control plane and data plane. Control plane logs, also called system logs, record events on the routing platform. Data plane logs, also called security logs, record security events handled directly inside the data plane.

- **Event Mode:** Security log messages generated in the data plane are directed to the control plane and stored locally on the device. Security log messages stored in binary format are maintained in a separate log file. Events stored in a binary log file are not accessible with advanced log-scripting commands intended for text-based log files. A separate CLI operational command supports decoding, converting, and viewing binary log files stored locally on the device.
- **Stream Mode:** Security log messages generated in the data plane are streamed to a remote device. When these messages are stored in binary format, they are streamed directly to an external log collection server in a Juniper-specific binary format. Externally-stored binary log files can only be read using Juniper Secure Analytics (JSA) or Security Threat Response Manager (STRM).

**On-Box Logging and Reporting:**

**Overview:**

On-box traffic logging to solid-state drives (SSDs) supports eight external log servers or files. An all-in-one XML file contains all the traffic logs information and generates logging header files and traffic log-related documents. A new process (daemon) called `local log management daemon` (llmd) is supported in Services Processing Cards 0 (SPCs0) to handle on-box traffic logging. Traffic produced by `flowd` in SPCs is listed in traffic logs, and `llmd` saves these logs to the local SSD.

**Log Formats:**

| Log Format | Description | Default |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Syslog | Traditional log format to save logs. | Yes |
| Sd-syslog | Structured system log file format. Most descriptive and lengthy, taking more space to store and longer to transfer. | - |
| Welf | WebTrends Enhanced Log file Format, an industry standard. Compatible with Firewall Suite 2.0 and later, Firewall Reporting Center 1.0 and later, and Security Reporting Center 2.0 and later. | - |
| Binary | Juniper proprietary format. Least descriptive and takes the least space compared to other formats. | - |
| Protobuf | Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. File size is small compared to syslog and sd-syslog. | - |

**On-Box Reporting Features:**

- **Sqlite3 Support:** Starting with Junos OS Release 15.1X49-D100, an SQL log database (SQLite Version 3) is used by daemons running on the RE and other potential modules to store logs on SRX Series Firewalls. In Junos OS Release 19.4R1, the on-box logging database was upgraded to improve query performance.
- **llmd in Both Junos OS and Linux OS:** The forwarding daemon (`flowd`) decodes the database index from binary logs and sends both the index and log to the `llmd`. On SRX300, SRX320, SRX340, SRX345, and SRX550M devices, `llmd` runs in Junos OS. On SRX1500, SRX4100, and SRX4200 devices, `llmd` runs in Linux. The `llmd` code directory was moved from the Linux side to the Junos OS side to support running in both environments.
- **Storing Logs into Specified Table of the SQLite3 Database:** A new syslog daemon collects local logs on SRX Series Firewalls and saves them into the database. Starting in Junos OS Release 19.3R1, logs are stored in multiple tables instead of a single table in a database file. Each table contains the timestamp of the oldest and latest logs. When you initiate a query based on the start and end time, `llmd` finds the latest table to generate reports.
