### The Cost of Recording and Distributing Pirated Content

To effectively combat piracy, it is essential not only to increase the cost of recording and presenting pirated content to users but also to maintain a high cost for distributing such content. Specifically, the entertainment industry must develop strategies to deter peer-to-peer (P2P) distribution of pirated content.

### Attacks on Peer-to-Peer Networks and Countermeasures

This section explores various attacks on P2P networks and the countermeasures employed to mitigate them. We will consider these attacks in the context of the security assets they target: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 3.1 Confidentiality

Breaches of confidentiality can increase the liability costs associated with distributing pirated content and can reveal information that can be used to launch further attacks on the system's integrity and availability. If caught, both senders and receivers of pirated content may face legal action or other forms of retaliation.

Using current P2P networks is particularly risky because eavesdroppers can intercept and observe pirated content in transit. Even if the content is encrypted, traffic analysis can still reveal the network addresses of the sender and receiver and the size of the files being transferred. Attackers use these confidentiality breaches to interrupt file transfers, locate pirates to send cease and desist messages, and gather evidence for litigation.

The first step in protecting the confidentiality of the network is to encrypt the data so that only the sender and receiver know what was sent. However, encryption alone cannot ensure that the party at the other end is not an attacker. For this reason, systems that provide anonymity or plausible deniability are desirable. In such systems, the attacker may know that copyrighted content was transmitted through the network but cannot identify the original sender or final recipient.

A common approach to anonymous networking is to re-route communications through multiple nodes, making it difficult to track the communication effectively. While attackers may monitor the communication or run routers that expose routing information, these threats can be mitigated if a reasonable fraction of the routers act to keep routing information confidential. Currently, there is no way to determine which clients will route traffic through the network with the intent of protecting anonymity.

Attacking the network is not the only way to breach confidentiality. By running P2P client software and controlling a peer, an attacker can gain access to the network through the "eyes" of the client software. Since operating systems make every byte of a program's memory available to the machine's administrator, the attacker can locate encryption keys, network topology information, and other critical data. Once confidentiality is breached, the attacker can use this information to write programs that impersonate genuine P2P clients and attack the network from within, enabling scalable attacks on integrity and availability.

#### 3.2 Integrity

The integrity of information in a P2P system can be compromised by introducing degraded-quality content or misrepresenting the identity of the content. In the context of music, this includes introducing noisy recordings or falsely labeling songs. Attacks on the integrity of information describing the operation of the P2P network, such as network topology and routing information, can disrupt communication or even prevent users from accessing the network.

Reputation systems can counter corrupt content attacks by allowing users to rate the validity of content and those who provide it. To ensure that all copies of the same content share the same reputation, content can be identified by its fingerprint (or hash). This enables reputations to scale beyond individual trust and allows widely duplicated corrupt files to be quickly recalled.

To prevent attackers from modifying or deleting reputation information, this data should be distributed among other clients using protocols that prevent tampering. Additionally, since attackers can delete and reinstall clients, a reputation system should also maintain information about the machines on which clients run. However, virtual machines complicate this issue, as potential unique machine identifiers can be easily modified.

While reputation systems can be resilient to a large number of malicious users, no existing system is immune to an unlimited number of such users. If an attacker can write programs that impersonate genuine clients, there is no limit to the number of malicious peers that can be introduced into the system.

#### 3.3 Availability

More resources are expended performing searches on P2P networks than are required to request a search. Attackers can flood the network with a large number of search requests, overwhelming it. Alternatively, the attacker can force their client application to drop packets it was meant to route by manipulating the operating system or disconnecting network cables at strategic times.

Peers can mitigate the flood of requests by requiring proof of computational work before processing a request. This concept, introduced by Dwork and Naor, increases the cost of sending spam and has been extended to prevent network-level denial of service attacks for TCP and TLS. Requiring clients to solve puzzles before issuing requests could significantly reduce flooding attacks on P2P networks. However, the entertainment industry might still be able to harness enough processing power to flood networks if they can exploit the media players they control to perform puzzle computations on user machines.

An alternative to client puzzles is to use reputation systems to track individual machine utilization of network resources. However, this approach is limited if the attacker can corrupt the reputation system or run a large number of genuine clients on virtual machines with scripted input. The payoff for the entertainment industry in scaling such attacks is increased barriers between users and pirated content, raising the per-copy distribution cost.

### Defending Peer-to-Peer Distribution

At the time of writing, Sharman Networks, the makers of Kazaa, claim that over 200 million copies of their client application have been downloaded. Given the vast resources of these networks, attacks will only be affordable if the cost of the attack is many times smaller than the damage inflicted on the distribution network.

The countermeasures described in Section 3 are sufficient to defend P2P networks against attacks from individual users running authentic clients on real machines. However, attackers can still gain an advantage by peering into clients running on their own machines, using this information to write programs that impersonate real clients, and running as many copies of these clients as needed to disrupt the network. Alternatively, they can script attack behaviors and feed them into a large number of authentic clients running in parallel on virtual machines.

Can P2P networks be made immune to malicious client software written by attackers? They can if the personal computer industry delivers on its promise of remote attestation. This technology, originally envisioned to thwart pirates, is exactly what a P2P system needs to ensure that no client application can enter the network unless it, along with the hardware and operating system it runs on, has been certified by a trusted authority. The trust model can be simple: accept only new clients into the network if they are certified by the same authority that vouched for the existing clients.

Moreover, if Microsoft delivers on the promises of its next-generation secure computing base for Windows, clients can be assured of secure storage and curtained memory. With these technologies, P2P systems can protect the confidentiality and integrity of the clients' memories, which collectively form the memory of the entire network.

### Conclusion

To thwart piracy, the entertainment industry must keep distribution costs high, reduce the size of distribution networks, and, if possible, raise the cost of extracting content. However, if 'trusted computing' mechanisms deliver on their promises, large P2P distribution networks will be more robust against attacks, and trading in pirated entertainment will become safer, more reliable, and thus cheaper. Since it will always be possible for some individuals to extract content from the media on which it is stored, future entertainment may be more vulnerable to piracy than before the introduction of 'trusted computing' technologies.
