### User Responses to Security Warnings

Research from the warning sciences community suggests that if a warning does not sufficiently stimulate users or if users cannot meaningfully process and apply the warning's message, it will have limited effect [57]. Some responses from email users indicated that our warnings failed to both capture their attention and convey a meaningful message. They often assumed our warnings were similar to other "standard" warnings or felt that our site was generally more secure. For example:

- "I figured it was just standard stuff."
- "It looked like a standard confidentiality issue, so I didn’t think of it as anything particularly special."
- "I just chalked it up to general security advice and more or less forgot about it."
- "It made me feel that the website was more secure."
- "This bit of information made me feel like the site was trying to protect my privacy."
- "It did not affect my decisions much, but it did help the validity of the survey."

### Lack of User Suspicion

Our attacks raised suspicion in only a small percentage of users. Many users had alternative interpretations. Some saw the attack as an error with the website, browser, computer, or network. Others did not view complying with the attack instructions as risky but thought it was necessary for their own safety. For example:

- "I followed the instructions because it was for my own safety."
- "I did because I wanted to stay secure so that people couldn’t come in and take my PayPal account."
- "The site is verifying I am who I say I am; I never thought of it in terms of me questioning the site’s identity."

Some users indicated they did not fully understand the registration procedure and its purpose. For example:

- "I figured that because I switched connections, as I was using Berkeley’s wireless as opposed to my dormitory’s ethernet Internet, they needed to re-verify my account."
- "I followed the instructions because I assumed my password was wrong so the alternate method of login was by answering the security questions."
- "I figured it had been too many days since I’d signed in."
- "I answered them because I couldn’t remember if you guys said that we will randomly be asked to answer them in place of our password and login name."
- "I remembered this page, and I followed the instructions because they are often used to verify a user if a username seems unsafe or has been tampered with."
- "The link in the email contains a data string that, when clicked, changes account details to confirm that that was a valid email address. Security benefits to the user may be minimal."
- "I think it prevents hackers from just creating accounts and using them but they would have to go to the extra step of doing the email registrations."
- "I actually didn’t think it had anything to do with the security of my money/identity."

These results are consistent with previous work suggesting that users have a limited understanding of web security mechanisms, Internet social engineering attacks, and effective defense strategies [13, 14, 26, 58]. This evidence supports our design principle for conditioned-safe ceremonies, which argues that designers should not assume users will be able to detect attacks or sufficiently understand ceremonies to know when they should refrain from participating or perform voluntary defensive actions.

### The Power of User Conditioning and Forcing Functions

Challenge question-based registration conditions users to provide their answers when asked. The responses of 58% of the vulnerable challenge question users indicated that conditioning was the primary influence on their decision to comply with the simulated attack’s request for their answers. User responses of this type include:

- "I answered the questions because I thought I was being asked to identify myself."
- "I answered it because it was required in order to log in."
- "I wanted to log in, so I answered the challenge questions."

In contrast, the responses of 56% of email users who resisted the simulated attack suggested that conditioning was a factor in their resistance. The responses of 40% of resisting email users suggested they may have noticed the attack was somewhat different from a normal registration but either chose to ignore the attack instructions and click the link or did not read the attack instructions carefully. User responses of this type include:

- "I didn’t follow the instructions because I didn’t pay attention to this page (I just followed the usual procedures to register my computer)."
- "I didn’t follow the directions because it sounded sketchy and I wanted to see what happened."
- "I must have glossed over the instructions to not click the registration email link, I didn’t think there would be two opposing instructions so I just went with the one that was more obvious."
- "I didn’t read it carefully, and instinctively clicked on the link in the email."

The responses of 16% of resisting email users suggested that they probably did not notice any differences between our simulated attack and a normal registration and proceeded to click on the registration link in the email sent to them. User responses of this type include:

- "I don’t remember ever seeing this page, but I think what I might have seen was simply that I thought this page was giving me the same instructions as the first time when I had to register my computer."
- "I don’t remember because it has been a hectic week. I just didn’t notice."
- "I don’t really remember this or I misread it."
- "It’s currently 2:20am and I just got back from 5 hours of dance practice. Honestly, I didn’t even see the instructions!!! How scary!"

These results suggest that conditioning played a significant role in a large fraction of users’ decision-making processes during our simulated attacks—benefiting email registration but harming challenge question-based registration.

### Previous Exposure to Security Mechanisms

One factor our study did not control is the degree to which challenge questions and clicking on email links had conditioned users prior to participating in our study. Several sites currently implement challenge question-based registration [7, 27, 49], and many use challenge questions for password reset. Although we do not know of any sites that implement email registration for machine authentication, many websites send an email link to reset a user’s password or validate their email address [21]. We did not screen users based on previous exposure to these mechanisms, but we did ask users whether they had previously used them. 80% of challenge question users and 70% of email users reported having used the respective mechanisms prior to participating in our study. However, we found no significant correlation between previous exposure to these mechanisms and attack success rate. We leave better understanding of this issue as a subject of future work.

### Ecological Validity

We asked users to give feedback about their impressions of the study, and their responses suggested that predicting popular movies can be fun and engaging. Some users expressed disappointment that we ended the study before they had the opportunity to make all seven predictions. Some users admitted they had no idea as to the true purpose of the study, and no user claimed to have figured out that the study was security-related. Based on this evidence, we argue that the effects of demand characteristics were sharply diminished in our study.

Our study created an experience of risk for some users, but many users indicated that the risk level they associated with our site was roughly equivalent to web email or social networking sites and below financial-related sites such as banking or shopping. Some users explicitly stated in their comments that they did not experience much risk during our study, e.g., "And even if someone had hacked the site, what had I to lose? An experiment account? I was not particularly worried." Some users suggested that they felt safer at our site because it was associated with Berkeley, e.g., "I figured that since this was a Berkeley research-affiliated website, it would be safe." Creating a significant experience of risk in studies like ours remains a challenge.

### Limitations of the Study

Our study had several limitations. Although we took great efforts to make our study as ecologically valid as possible (while remaining ethical), some users' responses suggested we fell short in some aspects, most notably in simulating the experience of risk in the real world and completely eliminating the influence of authority figures. The size of the compensation may not have been large enough to warrant extra attention, and the fact that our website was implicitly associated with UC-Berkeley may have influenced users' decisions.

We acknowledge that there may be more effective attacks against email-based registration. One potentially effective attack might be to try to hijack users' email accounts, but we did not implement this attack for ethical reasons. Another type of attack we did not evaluate is a prediction attack. In a prediction attack, the adversary creates the illusion that she can reliably predict the future. Being able to predict the future affords credibility, which an adversary may be able to exploit. If an adversary sends the user an email predicting that she will receive a registration email but requests that she handles it unsafely, she may be more likely to comply. Stock market scams employing this technique are often effective.

### Implications and Limitations of Email-Based Registration

One might argue that ceremonies that require users to click on email links will train users to click on phishing links and undermine some anti-phishing efforts that caution users to never click on links in emails. However, we argue that relying on users to never click on email links is unrealistic. Sending and clicking on links in email is often useful for users, and many password reset and recovery ceremonies currently require users to click on an email link [21]. Some phishing studies suggest that many users regularly click on email links and employ a wide variety of link-clicking strategies based on the current task, apparent source of the email, and other contextual cues [13, 15]. It would be a significant challenge to eliminate these practices. We argue that more comprehensive defenses that assume users will click on some email links are more likely to be effective.

Another potential criticism is that email-based registration simply shifts many of the security and usability burdens onto email systems. The security of email systems relies on the security of email servers and users' email passwords. This raises several concerns [21]:

- A user might use a weak email password or use the same password for all her accounts.
- Some email providers use weak password reset and recovery mechanisms, such as challenge questions, which may be vulnerable to social engineering and inference attacks.
- Users may view their email accounts as less sensitive than their financial accounts and fail to adequately protect their email passwords. In our study, many users viewed the security of their email accounts as having the same level of importance as their accounts at social networking sites, but below their accounts at financial sites.
- Email is often sent over unencrypted connections, and POP and IMAP servers often accept passwords sent over unencrypted connections.
- Employees at businesses or ISPs might have access to their users' email.
- Several users might share a single email account.
- Email delivery is sometimes delayed.
- Spam filters may block legitimate messages.

Our study collected a limited amount of information from each user. Since we never met our users, we could not directly observe users' reactions, record comments, or probe for details during the study. Also, since the vast majority of our users were undergraduates at UC-Berkeley, we cannot easily generalize our results to the general population.

Although the widespread use of email for password recovery and reset suggests that these issues may be manageable, we should not ignore them. Ideally, we should explore more secure and reliable messaging alternatives for security-critical applications. One potential direction is to send registration links to users' mobile phones and develop software that enables easy transfer of the links to users' computers.

### Related Work

Studies that simulate attacks against users. Security researchers have conducted numerous studies that simulate attacks against users. Several studies have tried to evaluate how well individuals can identify phishing emails and pages [13, 29, 58]. However, these studies do not fully address the design issues we identified in Section 6.1. They were all conducted in a laboratory environment, and the users were either told the purpose of the experiment or asked to role-play a fictitious identity.

To help create the experience of risk, some laboratory studies have employed deception and required users to participate with their own accounts. Egelman et al. conducted such a study to evaluate the effectiveness of browser phishing warnings [16]. Users made purchases with their own credentials, and the researchers sent the users spear phishing emails related to those purchases, which triggered phishing warnings in Firefox and Internet Explorer. Schecter et al. asked real Bank of America SiteKey customers to log into their accounts from a laptop in a classroom [44]. Although SiteKey uses challenge questions, Schecter et al. did not evaluate SiteKey’s use of them. Instead, they focused on whether each user would enter her online banking password in the presence of clues indicating her connection was insecure. They simulated site-forgery attacks against each user by removing various security indicators (e.g., her personalized SiteKey image) and causing certificate warnings to appear, and checked if each user would still enter her password. Since SiteKey will only display a user’s personalized image after her computer is registered, Schecter et al. first required each user to answer her challenge questions during a “warm-up” task to re-familiarize her with the process.
