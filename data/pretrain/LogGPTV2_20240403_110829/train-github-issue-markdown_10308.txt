Hi y'all
I'm using Next.js V3.0.3 and I'm having problem on IE11 with the following
error;
    Object doesn't support property or method 'assign'
    TypError: Object doesn't support property or method 'assign' 
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

  2. use `{...oneObject, ...secondObject}` in your code
  3. build
