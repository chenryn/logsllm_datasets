Hello,

I am encountering an issue with the following Ansible task, which fails with the error message "You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression." This error only occurs when the `force` parameter is specified. The `KIT` directory has already been created.

- **Ansible version:** 2.0.0.2
- **Operating System:** CentOS 6.7 (control node)
- **Target Operating System:** Windows Server 2012 R2

### Task:
```yaml
- name: Download kit
  win_get_url:
    force: no
    url: 'http://some_random_url/some_random_program.exe'
    dest: 'C:\KIT\some_random_program.exe'
```

Could you please help me resolve this issue?

Thank you!
