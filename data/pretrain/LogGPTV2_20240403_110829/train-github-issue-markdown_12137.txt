Hello I have the below task and fails with "You cannot call a method on a
null-valued expression." only when parameter "force" is specified. The "KIT"
directory is already created.  
Ansible version is 2.0.0.2 on CentOS 6.7. The target operating system is
Windows Server 2012 R2.
name: Download kit  
win_get_url:  
force: no  
url: 'http://some_random_url/some_random_program.exe'  
dest: 'C:\KIT\some_random_program.exe'
Thanks!
