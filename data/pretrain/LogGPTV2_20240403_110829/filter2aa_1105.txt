# Digital Active Self-Defense

## Introduction
- **Current Threats and Limitations**
  - Despite the increasing use of security technologies, there are still significant security challenges.
  - Common issues include confidentiality, integrity, availability, and copyright.
  - External threats can be mitigated with firewalls, proxies, and hardened services, but attackers often find ways to bypass these defenses.
  - Internal threats, such as unauthorized access by employees or contractors, require robust authentication and in-depth protection.

- **Active Defense**
  - There is a natural temptation to fight back against attackers, but few solutions currently use active countermeasures.
  - This field is ripe for research and development.

## The Digital Threats
- **External Threats**
  - Ethical hackers, corporate spies, and cyber terrorists continue to pose significant risks.
  - Firewalls, proxies, and other security measures help, but attackers can exploit vulnerabilities and weak security rules.

- **Internal Threats**
  - Employees, trainees, and outsourcing partners can also pose risks.
  - Authentication and in-depth protection are essential to mitigate these threats.

## From Hardening to Reaction
- **Blocking Evil Traffic**
  - Technologies like routers, firewalls, and proxies can block malicious traffic, but attackers often find ways to bypass these defenses.
  - Countermeasure technologies, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), can detect and respond to attacks, but there is often a delay between detection and response.

## Countermeasure Problems
- **Detection and Response Delays**
  - The time between detecting an attack and responding can allow some packets to reach the victim.
  - IDS systems may see signs of an attack while the victim is already being attacked, leading to delayed responses.
  - Examples of problems include SQL worms and multiple-source attacks.

## Prevention and Countermeasure
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**
  - Combining IDS with firewalls to prevent attacks as they are detected.
  - Network IPS (NIPS) and Host IPS (HIPS) offer inline detection and prevention.
  - Bait and switch honeypots can divert evil traffic to a fake network, providing both prevention and deception.

## Prevention and Deception
- **Diverting Evil Traffic**
  - Techniques like bait and switch can redirect malicious traffic to a fake network, preventing the attack and deceiving the attacker.
  - Example: "Building an Early Warning System in a Service Provider Network" by Nicolas Fischbach.

## Diversion Limitations
- **Single Point of Failure**
  - Bait and switch techniques can become a single point of failure if not properly configured.
  - Attackers can evade detection by using IP spoofing and other evasion techniques.
  - TCP problems and fingerprinting can also limit the effectiveness of these methods.

## BlackHats versus Prevention
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**
  - IDS and IPS systems can be overwhelmed by DoS attacks, making them less effective.
  - Evasion techniques and zero-day exploits can bypass even the most advanced systems.
  - Spoofing attacks from friendly hosts can cause further complications.

## Active Defense
- **Usual Methods**
  - Blocking incoming traffic and rate limiting can help, but these methods may not always be sufficient.
  - Diverting traffic to honeypots and sending fake responses can be more effective.
  - More aggressive methods, such as self-defense and counterstrike, may be necessary in some cases.

## Legal Issues
- **Digital Self-Defense**
  - Self-defense in the digital realm is a complex legal issue.
  - Necessity and proportionality are key considerations.
  - Proving that no adequate alternatives were available can be challenging.

- **Information Warfare**
  - Information warfare is not officially recognized by international conventions, making it a gray area legally.

## Technical Considerations
- **Striking Back**
  - Identifying tools, methods, and sources of attacks is crucial.
  - Avoiding spoofing and taking appropriate action based on white and blacklists can help.
  - Fighting back against vulnerable clients, scanners, and trojans can be an effective strategy.

## Real Examples
- **Code Red II and MSBlast**
  - Proof-of-concept scripts and techniques have been developed to automatically clean infected hosts.
  - Honeyd and other tools can be used to fight back against worms and other malware.

## Requirements
- **Graduated Response**
  - A graduated response system can help ensure proportional and appropriate reactions.
  - Determining the level of threat and profiling the attack are essential steps.
  - DEFCON levels can be used as a reference for different levels of readiness.

## Specific Opportunities
- **Honeypots**
  - Honeypots are valuable for deceptive defense, as incoming traffic is inherently suspicious.
  - They provide an opportunity to launch counterstrikes with a higher degree of certainty.

- **Internal Computers**
  - Remote administration of internal computers can be used to protect the network.
  - Striking back against internal threats can be an effective way to identify and neutralize malicious actors.

## Handling Internal Threats
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**
  - Striking back against internal computers can be done under legal control.
  - Layer 2 attacks and spoofing are potential risks that need to be managed.

## Technical Limitations
- **Counterstrike Technologies**
  - Not all threats have corresponding counterstrike technologies.
  - False positives, spoofing, and collateral damage are significant concerns.

## Conclusions
- **Technology**
  - Active defense offers new and exciting possibilities for protecting infrastructure.
  - In-depth security and advanced intrusion prevention systems can enhance overall security.

- **Organization**
  - Counterstrike can be used to target internal and external threats.
  - Information warfare remains a complex and evolving field.

- **Blackhats**
  - Active defense can be a double-edged sword, as attackers can also use these techniques to their advantage.

- **Questions and Greetings**
  - Questions are welcome.
