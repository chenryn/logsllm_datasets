User: I am interested in learning python but my Linux skills suck. I would like to develop a medium to large scale web application using python and django but afraid the software may not work well on a windows box. Is there a performance difference in running python on Linux vs Windows? Is there anything that I should watch out for when developing the application. Also, I am aware that it is very easy integrating C++ libraries with python. Is this statement still true is the code is on a windows box?
Assistant: but afraid the software may not work well on a windows box.  

Your software will work.  The Windows OS may not work as you hope.  But that's Windows, not Python.
We develop 100% on Windows.  We completely test: Unit test, integration test and user acceptance test on Windows.  100%.
We deploy for production 0% on Windows, 100% on Linux.
We have a few (less than 6) differences in the unit tests that are Windows-specific.  
The application has no changes.  It works with Apache or not.  It works with SQLite or MySQL.
