ABSTRACT
The objective of early network tomography approaches was
to produce a point estimate for the performance of each
network link (Analog tomography). When it became clear
that the previous approach is error-prone in practice, re-
search shifted to Boolean tomography where each link is
estimated as either “good” or “bad”. The Boolean approach
is more practical but its resolution is too coarse. We pro-
pose a new tomography framework that combines the best
of both worlds: we still distinguish between good and bad
links (for practicality reasons) but we also infer a range es-
timate for the performance of each bad link. We apply the
Range tomography framework in two path performance met-
ric functions (Min and Sum) and propose an eﬃcient algo-
rithm for each problem. Together with simulations, we have
also applied Range tomography in three operational net-
works allowing us to identify the location of bad links and
to estimate their performance during congestion episodes.
We also compare the proposed method with existing Analog
and Boolean tomography algorithms.

INTRODUCTION
The objective of network tomography is to infer the in-
ternal characteristics of a network (e.g., link delay and loss
rate, topology) from end-to-end path measurements. As a
research area, network tomography is both interesting and
signiﬁcant. It is interesting because the underlying estima-
tion problem is typically under-constrained (more unknowns
than equations) and so its solution requires creative and

domain-speciﬁc additional constraints and objectives. Fur-
ther, network tomography combines the art of active probing
with the science of statistical inference. Network tomogra-
phy is also signiﬁcant in practice because it allows users and
network administrators to monitor and troubleshoot a set
of network paths of interest without having direct access to
every router and switch in those paths. This is particularly
important in the context of interdomain paths, i.e., paths
that traverse more than one network provider. Addition-
ally, as IP-based networks move towards performance-based
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) tomographic methods will
become even more valuable. In fact, the motivation for this
work resulted from an actual system that is used to monitor
in real-time the performance of network paths that inter-
connect a large number of scientiﬁc research labs around
the world using end-to-end measurements.
The ﬁrst eﬀorts in network tomography, about 15 years
ago, focused on the most challenging instance of the prob-
lem: estimate the actual performance (e.g., loss rate or delay
variation) of every link in the monitored network [1, 2]. We
refer to those tomographic methods as Analog because they
provide a real-valued performance estimate for each link.
Analog tomography is a very challenging problem for sev-
eral reasons, some of which are related to the underlying
path measurements. For instance, those early methods as-
sume that if two paths go through a single and shared lossy
link, their measured path loss rates will be equal. This may
be true if the measurements last for a very long period, as-
suming that the network load is stationary and the routes
do not change.
In practice, however, network conditions
change signiﬁcantly with time, and so the path measure-
ments must be performed in short time intervals (e.g., one
minute) before they become stale [3]. To make things worse,
the probing frequency cannot be too high because the path
measurements can then aﬀect the underlying network per-
formance [4]. So, Analog tomography methods need to work
with noisy path estimates that result from short-term active
measurements.
In 2003, Duﬃeld proposed a paradigm shift in network to-
mography [5]. Instead of trying to estimate the actual per-
formance of a link, it is more practical to only infer whether
the link’s performance is “good” versus “bad”. This approach
is referred to as Boolean tomography and it has also been fol-
lowed by other researchers [6, 8]. Here, path measurements
become much simpler (just detect congested paths) and so
they can take place in shorter time periods and with fewer
probes. The problem, of course, is that the result of the
tomographic process has low resolution: just a single bit for
385each link. This may be suﬃcient if the objective is to simply
identify severe congestion. In practice, however, the conges-
tion level of network links varies widely and even though an
application or operator may be satisﬁed with a loss rate of
0.1% or a queueing delay of 50msec, another may ﬁnd these
congestion levels unacceptable.
In this work, we propose a new approach in network to-
mography that attempts to combine the higher resolution
of Analog tomography with the practicality of Boolean to-
mography. The path measurements are still classiﬁed as
good or bad, to exploit the fact that most network paths
typically operate without congestion [15]. This allows us to
quickly remove a large number of links from the problem,
as long as they only appear in good paths. For the remain-
ing paths, we aim not only to identify bad links, but also
to estimate a range (interval) for their actual performance.
The width of the resulting range depends on the variability
in the underlying path measurements: more accurate path
measurements will result in narrower range estimates. We
refer to the proposed framework as Range Tomography.
We apply the Range tomography framework in two path
performance formulations: a Min function in which a path’s
performance is determined by the link with the minimum
performance, and a Sum function in which a path’s perfor-
mance is determined by the sum of its links’ performance
values. Min is more appropriate for metrics such as avail-
able bandwidth, while Sum can be used for delay and (as
an approximation) for loss rate. For each formulation we
propose an eﬃcient algorithm to identify bad links and es-
timate their performance range. The algorithms are ﬁrst
evaluated with simulations in three real topologies. Sim-
ulations are not ideal, but they allow us to examine the
false positives, false negatives and accuracy of Range tomog-
raphy under controllable and repeatable experiments. We
performed these simulations under both random and bursty
loss processes, showing the signiﬁcant impact of the latter
in network tomography methods. Further, we compare the
proposed algorithms with “canonical” methods from Analog
and Boolean tomography.
We have also applied the proposed methods in practice
to detect and localize congestion events in three operational
large networks, where the number of monitored paths varies
between 70-3600. Even though we cannot use those real-
world experiments for validation (we do not have access to
routers and switches in those networks), they show some
interesting points. First, in practice, there is rarely more
than one bad link in the monitored paths and so the false
positive/negative probability is close to zero. Second, the
actual congestion level of those bad links can vary widely,
and so it is important to also estimate a congestion range
instead of a single bit.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2, we describe the Range Tomography problem. In Sections
3 and 4, we consider the Min and Sum formulations, respec-
tively. In Section 5, we evaluate tomography methods using
simulations. We present a short summary of the experimen-
tal results in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the related work
and we conclude in Section 8.
2.1 Problem statement
We are given a set of N measurement points or hosts,
referred to as sensors S = {s1, ..., sN}. Each sensor mea-
sures the end-to-end path performance, with respect to a
certain metric such as loss rate, one-way delay or available
bandwidth, to all other sensors. We are interested to local-
ize performance problems, with respect to the corresponding
metric, in the set Π of N × (N − 1) paths between sensors.
The forwarding paths between sensors can be “mapped” at
the IP-layer using traceroute-like tools (such as Paris tracer-
oute [22]). Each path is represented by a sequence of links
and each link is represented by the IP address of the cor-
responding router or host interface. Let G = (V, E) be the
directed graph constructed from the union of all paths be-
tween sensors.
Suppose that pi,j denotes the path from sensor si to sensor
sj, and mi,j is the actual performance of pi,j for a given per-
formance metric in the time interval of interest. We assume
that there is a function f that expresses the performance of
a path based on the performance of its constituent links,
mi,j = f ({xl|∀l ∈ pi,j})
(1)
where xl is the actual performance of link l. We refer to
f as the path metric function. For instance, in the case
of available bandwidth, the performance of the end-to-end
path is determined by the link with the minimum available
bandwidth. Thus, the function f for available bandwidth is
based on the MIN operator. In the case of delay, jitter and
(as an approximation) loss rate, the path performance can
be estimated by the sum of link performances. Hence, the
function f would be the SUM operator for those metrics. In
network tomography, we attempt to invert function f and
estimate the performance of some links given the measured
performance of a set of paths that traverse those links. As
in other instances of tomography, this “inversion problem”
is typically ill-deﬁned and it can be solved only if we impose
additional constraints, optimization objectives and assump-
tions [10].
In practice, the performance of a network path must be
measured with low frequency probing (i.e., the probing traf-
ﬁc load should be low compared to the capacity of the path),
and in short time intervals (due to dynamic network condi-
tions). Hence, the measured path performance can be sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent than the actual path performance.
In
other words, the measured performance of two paths shar-
ing the same bottleneck link can be diﬀerent even though
their actual performance is the same. Let ˜mi,j be the mea-
sured performance of path pi,j in the time interval of interest.
Because of the previous limitations of the measurement pro-
cess, we typically have that mi,j 6= ˜mi,j, while the diﬀerence
between the two metrics can vary signiﬁcantly over diﬀerent
paths. To illustrate this issue, consider the following simple
example. Assume that the packet drops at a link l follow a
Bernoulli random process with probability xl = 0.01, while
the measurement process sends n = 1000 probing packets
on that link. The variance of the measured packet losses is
n xl (1 − xl) and so the standard deviation (≈ √10) is sig-
niﬁcant compared to the expected number of packet losses
at link l (10 packets).
2. RANGE TOMOGRAPHY
In this section, we motivate, state and explain the Range
Tomography problem.
In the following, we introduce the Range Tomography
framework as a way to deal with the previous uncertainty in
path measurements. First, we inherit from Boolean tomog-
raphy the notion that paths and links can be distinguished

as “good” versus “bad”. Formally, a path pi,j is called bad if
its measured performance ˜mi,j is worse than a threshold δ
(δ may be zero, as in the case of loss rate for example). Sim-
ilarly, a link is bad if its performance metric is worse than δ,
otherwise it is good. After we infer the bad links from path
measurements, we also estimate the performance of every
bad link with a “range estimate” for its metric.
In other
words, we start with path point measurements and end up
with link range estimates. To this end, we ﬁrst identify and
group paths that are likely aﬀected by the same bad link
and then use the measured performance of these paths to
determine a narrow performance range for that link.
Deﬁnition 1. Two paths pi,j and pk,l are α-similar (rep-
resented by pi,j k pk,l), if their relative performance diﬀer-
ence is within a parameter α,
bad link are not α-similar, we can conclude that there are
additional bad links (as in the previous example).
Let ˜xl = [sl..el] denote the performance range assigned to
link l (i.e., the actual performance of l is estimated to be
between sl and el). |˜xl| denotes the width of range ˜xl. We
deﬁne next how to examine whether the assigned link per-
formance ranges are consistent with the path performance
measurements.
Deﬁnition 2. The performance ranges assigned to bad
links on a path pi,j are consistent with the measured per-
formance of pi,j if there is at least one value in each of these
ranges that would satisfy the path performance constraint
in (1). We denote the consistency relation as:
˜mi,j ≃ f ({˜xl|∀l ∈ pi,j}) if:
∀l ∈ pi,j,∃tl ∈ ˜xl : ˜mi,j = f ({tl|∀l ∈ pi,j})
(3)
To illustrate the previous deﬁnition, consider the following
example. Suppose that the measured loss rate of a path pi,j
is 1% and there are two bad links l1 and l2 in that path. The
performance range of both links is estimated as [1%-2%].
Obviously, these range estimates are not consistent with the
path measurement. On the contrary, if the performance
ranges are both [0.4%-0.6%], then they are consistent with
the measured path loss rate. In this case, we also say that
the performance ranges assigned to l1 and l2 justify the bad
path pi,j (pi,j is then called justiﬁed path).
Before stating the Range Tomography problem more for-
mally, we need to make the following assumptions:
(1) There are no spatial correlations between diﬀerent bad
| ˜mi,j − ˜mk,l|
min( ˜mi,j, ˜mk,l) ≤ α
(2)
links.1
where α is a positive parameter that quantiﬁes the accuracy
of the measurement process (we also say that the measure-
ments ˜mi,j and ˜mk,l are α-similar ). α is related to the
measurement process (e.g., size of probing packets, prob-
ing frequency, probing method) and to the characteristics of
the estimated path performance process. The parameter α
can be estimated experimentally, measuring paths that are
known to be limited by the same bottleneck link. The rela-
tive diﬀerence of the resulting path measurements should be
less than the chosen value of α. In the rest of this section,
we assume that α is given as an input to the network tomog-
raphy process. In Section 5, we discuss how we estimated α
in our experiments.
Let us consider the example of Figure 1. pi,j is the short-
est path from si to sj. End-to-end measurements indicate
that the paths p1,4, p2,4, p3,4 are lossy; their measured loss
rates are 15%, 5% and 7%, respectively. All remaining paths
are good. Boolean tomography would choose the link from
node-4 to node-5, represented by (4,5), as the only bad link
because it appears on all lossy paths. However, choosing a
single lossy link cannot explain why these paths have so dif-
ferent loss rates. If α = 0.5, paths p2,4 and p3,4 are α-similar.
Then, one plausible solution is that link (4,5) (shared by
the two α-similar paths) has a loss rate between 5% and
7% while link (1,4) on p2,3 has a loss rate between 8% and
10%. In general, the notion of α-similar paths improves the
network tomography process in two ways: 1) As opposed to
Analog tomography, we can avoid the incorrect detection of
multiple bad links in paths that show diﬀerent performance
even though they are aﬀected by the same bad link. 2) Un-
like Boolean tomography, when the paths sharing the same
(2) The routing paths between sensors remain constant
during the measurement process.2
(3) A path is bad, if and only if, there is at least one bad
link in that path.
Given the directed graph G and a measurement for each
path in Π, the Range Tomography problem can be stated as
follows:
Range Tomography (RT) problem: Infer all bad links
in G and assign a performance range to each bad link so
that:
1. The number of bad links is minimized.
2. The assigned performance ranges to bad links are con-
sistent with the path performance measurements, ∀pi,j ∈
Π : ˜mi,j ≃ f ({˜xl|∀l ∈ pi,j}).
In practice, it is not common to have multiple bad links
at the same time (this is also observed in our experimental
results in Section 6). So, as it is common in Boolean to-
mography, we consider an optimization objective that aims
to minimize the number of detected bad links. Without
1To the extent of our knowledge, there is no prior evidence
that such correlations are common or signiﬁcant in practice.
We make this assumption so that we can calculate the per-
formance of a path from the performance of its constituent
links through a simple function.
2If the network deploys multipath routing, we need to make
sure that both the Paris-traceroute packets and the probing
packets sent from one sensor to another use the same port
numbers so that they follow the same forwarding path.
387this objective, the solution of the RT problem can result in
several false positives. The complexity of the RT problem
depends on the metric function f . In the following two sec-
tions, we consider two speciﬁc instances of the function f
that can be used to capture diﬀerent performance metrics.
3. MIN METRIC FUNCTION
We ﬁrst consider a function that determines the perfor-
mance of path pi,j as the minimum performance among all
links in that path,
mi,j = min∀l∈pi,j{xl}
(4)
We refer to this instance of the RT problem as RT-Min.
The previous function can be used for performance metrics
such as capacity or available bandwidth, because these met-
rics are mostly determined by a single “bottleneck” link. In
the rest of this section, we will refer to available bandwidth
as the performance metric of interest (even though the pro-
posed algorithm is applicable to any metric that satisﬁes the
previous path performance constraint). We say a path (or a
