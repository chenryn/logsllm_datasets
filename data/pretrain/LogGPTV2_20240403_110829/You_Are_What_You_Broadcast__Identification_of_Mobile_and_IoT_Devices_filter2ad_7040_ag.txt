tackle the scalability issue of manual labeling, ARE [24] cre-
ates a rule-discovery engine to mine labeling rules from text
corpora crawled from the web. OWL is different from device
discovery approaches that we only rely on passive trafﬁc. Ac-
tive port scanning may be considered intrusive and forbidden
in many networks. OWL does not interrupt with the normal
operations of devices, nor does it intercept any peer-to-peer
trafﬁc between the devices and their owners or clouds.
IoT Sentinel [43] extracts features from network trafﬁc
and utilize a random forest classiﬁer to identify device types.
Similarly, [53] employed six different classiﬁers on packets
streams for device type recognition. AuDI [38] developed an
unsupervised learning approach to cluster same type/model of
devices, without any labeled data. [42] identiﬁes IoT device
types in a whitelist using features from TCP sessions. [28]
examines the network ﬂows to the vendors’ servers for device
identiﬁcation. [36] utilizes the requested domain names in
DNS trafﬁc for the identiﬁcation of vendors and device types.
WDMTI [64] uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Process on DHCP
features to classify IoT device types. OWL is different from
existing approaches that: (1) OWL utilizes passively collected
BC/MC packets, which does not require privileged access
to the network or using monitor mode at the WiFi adapter.
Existing approaches, except WDMTI, use peer-to-peer trafﬁc.
(2) OWL integrates two important network management func-
tions, device identiﬁcation and abnormal device detection,
into one comprehensive solution. And (3) OWL is tested on a
signiﬁcantly larger dataset at three granularity levels.
Malicious IoT device detection have been studied [17,
41, 47, 49]. OWL is essentially different from them in the
objectives–OWL detects fabricated or forged devices, while
they mostly focus on devices’ adversarial behaviors.
10 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a novel mobile/IoT device identiﬁca-
tion and abnormal device detection mechanism named OWL.
OWL extracts features from structural and textual informa-
tion embedded in the BC/MC packets. A multi-view wide and
deep learning (MvWDL) model is designed to identify the
manufacturer, type and model of devices. Meanwhile, OWL
also discovers the subtle evidence of inherent discrepancies
across views to detect fabricated/forged devices. Through
large-scale experiments, we show that OWL outperforms ex-
isting approaches in the literature in accuracy and coverage.
