### Security Vulnerabilities and Remote Attacks

Remote attackers can exploit multiple memory corruption issues to cause a denial of service. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to copy large strings from stack-based buffers, leading to potential system crashes or data corruption.

### Scalability and Labeling
To address the scalability issue of manual labeling, ARE [24] introduces a rule-discovery engine that mines labeling rules from web-crawled text corpora. OWL differs from device discovery approaches by relying solely on passive traffic. Active port scanning, which can be intrusive and prohibited in many networks, is not used. OWL does not interfere with normal device operations or intercept peer-to-peer traffic between devices and their owners or cloud services.

### Existing Approaches
- **IoT Sentinel [43]**: Extracts features from network traffic and uses a random forest classifier to identify device types.
- **[53]**: Employs six different classifiers on packet streams for device type recognition.
- **AuDI [38]**: Develops an unsupervised learning approach to cluster devices of the same type/model without labeled data.
- **[42]**: Identifies IoT device types in a whitelist using features from TCP sessions.
- **[28]**: Examines network flows to vendors' servers for device identification.
- **[36]**: Utilizes requested domain names in DNS traffic to identify vendors and device types.
- **WDMTI [64]**: Uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Process on DHCP features to classify IoT device types.

**OWL's Distinctive Features:**
1. **Passive Traffic Collection**: OWL uses passively collected BC/MC packets, eliminating the need for privileged network access or monitor mode at the WiFi adapter. Unlike most existing approaches, OWL does not use peer-to-peer traffic (except WDMTI).
2. **Integrated Network Management**: OWL combines two critical network management functions—device identification and abnormal device detection—into a single comprehensive solution.
3. **Large-Scale Testing**: OWL has been tested on a significantly larger dataset at three granularity levels, ensuring robust performance.

### Malicious Device Detection
Malicious IoT device detection has been studied in several works [17, 41, 47, 49]. OWL differs from these studies by focusing on detecting fabricated or forged devices, whereas they primarily target adversarial behaviors of devices.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce OWL, a novel mechanism for mobile/IoT device identification and abnormal device detection. OWL extracts features from structural and textual information embedded in BC/MC packets. A multi-view wide and deep learning (MvWDL) model is designed to identify the manufacturer, type, and model of devices. Additionally, OWL detects subtle discrepancies across views to identify fabricated or forged devices. Large-scale experiments demonstrate that OWL outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and coverage.
