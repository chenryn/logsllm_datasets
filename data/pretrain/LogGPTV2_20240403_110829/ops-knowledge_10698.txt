User: I'm trying to install a python package using easy_install. There are several python versions installed.
This causes the package to be installed on python2.7, whereas I want it to be installed on python2.4.
Suggestions?
Thanks
Edit:
I already have tried easy_install-2.4. I get -bash: easy_install-2.4: command not found
Assistant: It's hard to say without providing us operation system information you use. For example in OSX, easy_install has it's own versions, I just type easy_install[tab][tab] to get all available version of easy_install. 
In OSX and debian and redhat I've got these:

easy_install
easy_install-2.5
easy_install-2.6
easy_install-2.7

For each python version you've got your own package. For example if this would be pip there's packages in osx: 

py27-pip
py24-pip
py31-pip

easy_install probably build-in within python so it's should go per python version. and default one will be, the one which python version is set to default in your environment.
