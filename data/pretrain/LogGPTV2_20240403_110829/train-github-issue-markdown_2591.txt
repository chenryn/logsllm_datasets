[x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not
a duplicate.
It appears that https cannot work with nextjs in development but there is no
documentation or direct answer to this question in the issues history.
I want to use https through the node https module on my local machine and
communicate in dev environment over https to secure api's.
As far as I can tell the https server does not work properly. While I can
create the https server the connection is not considered secure by chrome. I
do see in the server specific http server handling, is this not accessible
through the api to configure?
in the server I am using
`const handle = app.getRequestHandler(); `  
to handle the requests, as far as I can tell this should be all that I need to
do to server the pages securely.
`return handle(req, res, parsedUrl) `
