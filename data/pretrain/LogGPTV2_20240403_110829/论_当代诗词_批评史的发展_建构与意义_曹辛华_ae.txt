第三，“当代诗词”批评史的建构，对推动当代诗词的良性发展有重要意义。如果说当代诗词创作 还一直处于自发状态，还未出现像古代那样的诗词流派，或者有但还未被我们总结发现，那么对批评史 的研究，将会理清这些问题。通过研究，可以总结出诗词学观念与理论，归纳出各种诗词流派、社团及 其主张。通过批评，引导诗词创作更加多姿多样、流派纷呈。通过对诗词作者的理论与批评者见解的阐 释，可以使人们的诗词学创作主张与追求更明确，由此提升创作水平。同时，以此教授写诗填词者，可 使其立足即正。创作与批评的互动，是任何文学或文艺发展所必需的，“当代诗词”批评史的终极目的 也正在此。第四，特别需要指出的是，“当代诗词”批评史的建构，有利于进一步打通新旧文学的壁垒，形成 	学科间的合作与互补。正如人们在研究现代文学时通常忽略了民国诗词一样，当代文学研究者所著的诗 	歌批评史，多集中在新诗批评上，而对与新诗并存的旧体诗词批评却基本未曾着笔。时至今日，在打通 	古今、融汇新旧的原生态文学批评理论的指导下，现当代文学研究界已认识到了这个问题，并提出了纠 	偏策略。如钱理群、黄修已、丁帆、沈卫威等新文学学者，已有不少论著着力于此。由于学科限制，他 	们大多是站在新文学立场上对旧体诗词进行审视，很多时候只是把旧体诗词作为新文学的参照，而不像 	李遇春那样将当代诗词作为一个单独或并列的存在。我们提出“当代诗词”批评史，目的就是使人们更 	清醒地意识到当代诗歌批评史里有一种“诗词”批评史与新诗批评并行并存，缺失“当代诗词”批评的 	当代诗歌批评史，是残缺不全的，反映不出当代诗歌批评的全部面目。而这种缺憾的造成，由人为的学 	科设置所导致，使得诗词研究者无视当代文学和新诗，而新诗研究者无能力顾及现当代诗词。由此来讲，“当代诗词”批评史的建构，对新旧汇通、学科互补具有促进意义。第五，“当代诗词”批评史的建构，还有利于批评观念的改变。当前于文学批评方面，还存在着一 种重古典、经典、名家而轻新创、当代和一般作家的现象。这种偏失，会导致人们重古贱今，以为当代 诗词不如古典诗词，自然对当代诗词的批评问题会轻视和忽略。当我们扭转这种思路，从科学考察与文 化的视角来看待当代诗词及批评问题时，就会发现“当代诗词”批评史不但值得做，而且大有可为。从 科学考察的视角看，凡是存在于诗歌王国的一切现象与问题，都必须用全面、普遍、联系、发展的观点 来对其进行调查、检验、研究，唯此方能真正把握其生态系统。当前，古代文学研究界已开始对“非文 学”文体、非大家、非“时代文学”、非“名人、名作、名现象”展开研究，并取得了相当丰硕的成果。如吴承学的文体学研究成果，a对中国古代除我们认为是文学文体外的各种实用文体进行考察，得出了 一系列的新见解与新理论。当我们以此种科学考察理念来看待当代诗词的批评时，同样也应当有新的 发明。如“老干部体”，通常我们认为其缺乏“文学性”或“艺术性”，历来倍受讥责。但我们追索这种 讥责式批评后的真正心态就会发现，所谓“老干部体”，与古代的台阁体或新文学家要打倒的“贵族文 学、山林文学”的实质是一致的：附庸风雅是一方面，更重要的是体现了诗词的“休闲”功能。因为他 们写诗填词的目的不在“惊人句”，而在消遣。当我们再从文化视角来看待当代诗词批评时，就会发现 任何一种行为都是文化的反映。批评在当代，实质上成为人们发泄、消遣的方式之一。批评诗词，既是 显示或显摆诗学见解或才能的方式，也是消磨时光、陶冶情怀的方式。学院派对当代诗词的批评，是精 英文化的体现。他们的批评在使民间的诗词艺术提高的同时，也使更多的诗词作者向精英靠近，诗词文 化的繁荣离不开学院派与民间派的互动。总之，“当代诗词”批评史的提出，是基于以上批评观念的结果，也将启发、刺激批评观念的转变。责任编辑：王法敏

financial supervision. Based on the dialectical paradigm of value negation, Marx uses the “longitudinal analysis framework”, combined with capital value (anti-value) and credit theory to analyze the causes of cyclical fluctuations and crisis outbreaks in the market economy system. This has very important theoretical and practical significance for how to identify systemic financial risks and improve financial supervision in China.Public Opinion in the Press and Citizen Diplomacy Before and After Negotiation of the “Twenty-one Demands” between China and JapanZeng Rong  128 	When Japan put forward the “Twenty-one Demands” in 1915, the public opinion in the Chinese press forcefully guided and promoted the participation of the Chinese people in diplomacy and the transfer of the connotation of citizen diplomacy from the interest-to-sovereignty. When the Sino-Japanese negotiations reached a deadlock, the media in both countries also opposed each other and gradually formed a “counter-resistance” situation for the diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The “backing” of Chinese citizen diplomacy has become increasingly evident in its diplomatic missions. Before and after Japan issued the ultimatum “Twenty-one Demands” to the Beijing government, the anti-Japanese actions under the guidance of the domestic press and media gradually evolved into a massive citizen diplomatic movement, which further strengthened the “backing” status of the citizen diplomacy. It reflects the people’s approval and support of the government of the Republic of China in the sense of the Republic and reflects the historical trend of the deep changes in the thinking of the citizen diplomacy under the perspective of modern press.The Evolution of the Political and Cultural Image of Sun Yat-sen in “Seventeen Years” in New China	——From the Perspective of Mainland Chinese AuthoritiesChu Xiuhong  135 	Sun Yat-sen’s ideal of personality and revolutionary achievements have always been respected or quoted by various political factions, and have been constantly translated as the spiritual resources for political legitimacy of all parties and the spiritual bridge connecting Chinese at home and abroad. In the 17 years since the establishment of the new China, the mainland authorities, from the ruling Communist Party of China to the Democratic parties participating in the political process, especially the democratic revolution and the Soong qingling as relatives, have, on the basis of their respective political aspirations and values, developed a framework for the construction of the main theme of the new China’s political culture, the memory of Sun yat-sen and multi-dimensional interpretation, showing the image of Sun Yat-sen as one. In order to enrich the research of Sun Yat-sen’s grandchildren in the post-Sun Yat-sen era and deepen the cognition of the evolution of social mainstream values, the author examines the situation, characteristics and historical background of the evolution of Sun Yat-sen’s political and cultural image.Discussion on the Development, Construction and Significance of the Criticism History of “Contemporary Poetry”Cao Xinhua  149 	With the deepening and new extension of the study of poetry, the study of contemporary poetry has gradually become a hot spot of academic research.

	——On the Rethinking of Yan Geling’s Novel AdaptationChen Linxia  164 	In the current context of media development, Yan Geling’s “adaptation trend” has become an opportunity for us to survey the relationship between novels and films. Its root is that prejudgement of the film and television capital that her texts can meet the current public psychology. So the research of adaptation of Yan Geling’s should not emphasize the artistic nature of the works only from the perspective of literature, but focus on the current film industry and its association with the social psychology. Her writing is not only based on individual memory, but also pays more attention to the extensive collection of materials, to gain fresh experiences of the times, and maintain close interaction with the mainland. The above reasons can be better to meet the demand for the content of the new century Chinese film. In addition, the adaptation trend is related to the internationalization trend of Chinese film writers. As an outstanding representative of overseas Chinese literature, Yan Geling has had a great influence at home and abroad. It is the right choice in the process of internationalization of Chinese movie writers.-178-
