### Title: Black Hat USA 2022: Glitched on Earth by Humans: A Black-Box Security Evaluation of the SpaceX Starlink User Terminal

The SpaceX-operated Starlink low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation aims to provide global satellite internet coverage. The widespread availability of Starlink User Terminals (UTs) exposes them to potential hardware hacking, opening the door for attackers to explore and exploit the network. The recent Viasat attack underscores the critical need for robust security in satellite communications, especially for UTs deployed in isolated locations.

This presentation details the first black-box hardware security evaluation of the SpaceX Starlink UT. The UT is equipped with a custom quad-core Cortex-A53 System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements verified boot based on the ARM Trusted Firmware (TF-A) project. The early-stage TF-A bootloaders, particularly the immutable ROM bootloader, include custom fault injection countermeasures. Despite the black-box nature of our evaluation, we were able to bypass firmware signature verification during the execution of the ROM bootloader using voltage fault injection.

By leveraging a modified second-stage bootloader, we successfully extracted the ROM bootloader and eFuse memory. Our emulation-based analysis revealed that the fault model used during the development of these countermeasures does not hold in practice. We initially performed our voltage fault injection attack in a laboratory setting and later implemented it using a custom printed circuit board, or 'modchip'. This attack results in an unfixable compromise of the Starlink UT, allowing us to execute arbitrary code.

Gaining root access to the Starlink UT is a prerequisite for freely exploring the Starlink network. This presentation will cover an initial exploration of the Starlink network and provide some details on the communication links. Our findings should enable other researchers to build on our work and further investigate the Starlink ecosystem.

All documented attacks were conducted within the scope of the SpaceX Bug Bounty program and were responsibly disclosed.
