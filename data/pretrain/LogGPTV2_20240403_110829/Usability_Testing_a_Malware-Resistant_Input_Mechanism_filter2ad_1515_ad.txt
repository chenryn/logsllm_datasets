We begin our analysis of the effects of warnings by
computing avgLeaked a
AW(u) for dif-
ferent attacks a and users u. These are computed anal-
ogously to equations (1)–(2), speciﬁcally by replacing
La
the logins
B a
AW(u)
and maxLeaked a
AW(u) since these logins cannot exhibit
the effects of the warnings in phase Attack-and-Warn.
We then compute sample statistics ¯x[avgLeaked a
AW]d and
s[avgLeaked a
AW]d over all users u ∈ U d where La

tributed identically), or ν[maxBin a
AW]d,
at signiﬁcance α = .05,4 meaning that training helped in
a statistically signiﬁcant way.5 Figure 5 includes p-values
for these tests in parentheses, with those for signiﬁcant re-
sults in boldface. That said, there are plenty of examples in
Figure 5 yielding inconclusive results.

The results in Figure 5 suggest
AW]d  0; some
users with avgLeaked a
At(u) = 0 performed worse in
Attack-and-Warn, as well.) While these users were by
no means in a majority, in some cases they performed
substantially worse in Attack-and-Warn than they did in
Attack. These poor showings in Attack-and-Warn re-
sult in some values of ¯x[avgLeaked a
AW]d increasing slightly
from ¯x[avgLeaked a
At]d; c.f., Figures 4(a) and 5(a). The
underlying reason why these users did more poorly in
Attack-and-Warn than in Attack is unknown to us, but two
possibilities come to mind. One is that these users misun-
derstood our warnings in a way that caused them to perform
more poorly. A second possibility is simply carelessness
or ambivalence on the part of the user, which seems likely
given that Attack-and-Warn commenced 70 days after our
recruiting presentations that outlined their incentives for the
experiment.
Another interesting observation is the bimodality that
is evident in Figure 6(b). This shows that with few ex-
ceptions, those that had room to improve either improved
