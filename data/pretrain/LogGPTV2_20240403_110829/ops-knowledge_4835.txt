User:  Is there an exception in the log, what is the reason for the exception, and how to solve it
Assistant: Whether there is an exception: No exception Description: This log records a QuorumCnxManager event, which is one of the components in the Zookeeper distributed coordination service to support election, synchronization, and communication functions. In the log, there is a warning level record, recording that a SendWorker is leaving the thread. This indicates that QuorumCnxManager is exiting or restarting gracefully, with no apparent errors or exceptions. Therefore, the log is normal and no solution is required.
