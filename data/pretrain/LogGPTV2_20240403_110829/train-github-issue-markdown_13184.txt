  * Electron version: any
  * Operating system: Linux
### Expected behavior
Latest Ubuntu comes with Wayland a default display server.  
On embedded devices, wayland provides usually the best rendering performance,
at least compared to X11 where the performance is usually pretty poor.
### Actual behavior
Current linux / arm / arm64 binary releases are great but run pretty bad from
my experience on embedded devices. They all link to libx11 / gtk which makes
them unusable for wayland.
libGtk can be build with --wayland-backend and then electron can be built
against it
I would really like electron team to consider providing prebuilt binaries
usable with wayland, that would open a new range of possibilities, especially
on embedded devices.
