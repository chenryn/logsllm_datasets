## Abstract
There is significant interest in defining a new network architecture that can meet the needs of the future Internet. One of the main challenges is integrating various technical solutions into a single, coherent architecture while ensuring economic viability. In this work, we discuss how to design a network architecture where choices at different layers of the protocol stack are explicitly exposed to users. This approach ensures that innovative technical solutions can be used and rewarded, which is essential for the wide deployment of this architecture.

## 1. Introduction
Much of the Internet's success comes from its ability to support a wide range of services at the edge of the network. However, the Internet offers little choice of service within the network. This limitation hinders the development and deployment of new networking services, protocols, security designs, management frameworks, and other components essential for the increasingly diverse systems, applications, and communication paradigms of the next-generation Internet.

We believe that choice is a key aspect of a network architecture and can drive the innovations necessary for future networks. Choice implies that network users can select from a range of alternative services that may differ in functionality, performance, and cost. For choice to arise, the network architecture must support the technology for dynamically introducing new alternatives and suitable economic processes to ensure that incentives trigger innovation and users can "vote with their wallets."

In this poster, we describe the outline of a network architecture that provides choice as a core principle.

## 2. Choice Inside the Network
Choices can appear at different layers in the protocol stack, ranging from different communication paths to different protocols and application-layer services. Our system for market-driven competition in networking functionality is based on three key principles (illustrated in Figure 1):

### Principle 1: Encourage Alternatives
The underlying network infrastructure must provide the building blocks to create different types of services and alternative services of the same type. Support for alternatives allows users to select the service(s) that best meet their needs and provide the best performance for their application. Unlike the present Internet, where competition exists primarily at the application layer, if at all, users should not be "stuck" with a service that does not meet their expectations. Instead, they should be able to choose a different service provider.

### Principle 2: Vote With Your Wallet
The underlying network infrastructure must provide the building blocks for users to financially encourage providers that offer superior and often innovative services, while discouraging those that offer inferior services and fail to innovate. The "money protocols" needed for users to pay for good services must be designed into the network. We believe that incentives and competition are crucial for the long-term health of the network—winning ideas will succeed, grow, and promote additional competition, while losing ideas will fade away.

### Principle 3: Know What Happened
Distinguishing services and providers that perform well from those that do not is crucial for robust competition. In a complex system like the Internet, determining what happened (i.e., whom to blame) when an end-to-end service does not meet user expectations can be challenging because providers may operate at different layers and in several locations along an end-to-end path. The network must provide building blocks that allow users and providers to determine and exchange information about the performance they experience. Such "introspection" capability also enables innovative network management and monitoring tools, which can evolve over time.

These principles are interdependent and mutually rely on each other. For example, if there are no other alternatives, there is no need to vote with one’s wallet, nor does it help to know that the current alternative is not a good one.

## 3. Network Architecture
Embracing the three principles discussed above requires new features and mechanisms not present in the current Internet. Figure 2 illustrates schematically how these principles interact within a network, which we dub ChoiceNet, and the new features they support.

As a starting point, one needs support for alternatives, including the ability to create and select among them. To support alternatives, ChoiceNet offers new control-plane mechanisms. More importantly, ChoiceNet introduces a new economy plane responsible for supporting the types of business relationships and incentives that drive innovation and change in the real world. The economy plane supports the advertisement of choices to users and selection from a set of alternatives.

Economy plane protocols enable users to negotiate desired levels of service and pay specific providers for services. It also includes mechanisms to establish the identity, level of trust, and reputation of the parties involved in a business relationship.

## 4. Use Scenario
To illustrate the ability of ChoiceNet to support innovation in the network, we briefly describe one use scenario, highlighting the benefits of choice as a fundamental feature of the architecture. Consider the selection of connection quality for video distribution.

A user may be offered different connection services for watching streaming video. These connections may differ in their technical implementation (e.g., quality-of-service, use of caching, etc.). The user selects a service (i.e., a complete package of end-to-end connection and related services) and pays for its use. Depending on the user's satisfaction with the video experience, they continue to use the chosen service or switch to another (i.e., vote with their wallet).

Users do not need to have technical expertise in judging low-level networking metrics; they simply make choices based on their overall experience. Since economic rewards are explicitly represented in the architecture, network service providers are incentivized to create innovative offerings. This approach can therefore drive continued innovation throughout the network.
