ABSTRACT
There has been a great interest in deﬁning a new network
architecture that can meet the needs of a future Internet.
One of the main challenges in this context is how to realize
the many diﬀerent technical solutions that have developed in
recent years in a single coherent architecture. In addition, it
is necessary to consider how to ensure economic viability of
architecture solutions. In this work, we discuss how to design
a network architecture where choices at diﬀerent layers of the
protocol stack are explicitly exposed to users. This approach
ensures that innovative technical solutions can be used and
rewarded, which is essential to encourage wide deployment
of this architecture.

INTRODUCTION
Much of the Internet’ success comes from its ability to
support a wide range of service at the edge of the network.
However, the Internet oﬀers little choice of service inside the
network.
It is widely agreed that this limitation inhibits
the development and deployment of new networking ser-
vices, protocols, security designs, management frameworks,
and other components that are essential to support the in-
creasingly diverse systems, applications, and communication
paradigms of the next-generation Internet

dencies.
We believe that choice is the key aspect of a network ar-
chitecture, and that it can drive innovations necessary for
future networks. Choice implies that the entities using the
network can select from a range of alternative services that
may diﬀer in functionality, performance, and cost. Choice
can only arise if the network architecture supports the tech-
nology necessary for dynamic introduction of new alterna-
tives. It is also necessary to put in place suitable economic
processes to ensure that incentives trigger innovation and
users can “vote with their wallets.”
In this poster, we describe the outline of a network archi-
tecture that can provide choice as a core principle.
2. CHOICE INSIDE THE NETWORK
Choices can appear at diﬀerent layers in the protocol stack
of a network, ranging from diﬀerent communication paths to
diﬀerent protocols and application-layer services. Our sys-
tem for a market-driven competition of networking function-
ality is based on three key principles (illustrated in Figure 1):
• Principle 1: Encourage Alternatives.
The
underlying network infrastructure must provide the
building blocks to create diﬀerent types of services and
to create alternative services of the same type. Sup-
port for alternatives allows users to select the service(s)
that best meets their needs, and provides the best per-
formance for their application. Implicit in this princi-
ple is the idea that—in contrast to the present Internet,
where competition exists only at the application layer,
105Figure 2: Overview of ChoiceNet architecture.
if at all—users must not be “stuck” when the service
they receive is not consistent with their expectations.
Rather, they must be able to choose a diﬀerent service
provider, to better meet their expectations.
• Principle 2: Vote With Your Wallet. The un-
derlying network infrastructure must provide building
blocks so that users can ﬁnancially encourage providers
that oﬀer superior (and often innovative) services,
while discouraging providers that oﬀer inferior services
and fail to innovate. In other words, the “money proto-
cols” needed for users to vote with their wallet (i.e., pay
for good services) must be designed into the network.
We believe that incentives and competition are cru-
cial for the long-term health of the network—winning
ideas will succeed, grow, and promote additional com-
petition, while losing ideas fade away.
• Principle 3: Know What Happened. Distinguish-
ing services and providers that perform well from those
that do not is crucial to enabling robust competition.
In a complex system like the Internet, determining
what happened (i.e., whom to blame) when an end-
to-end service does not meet user expectations can be
a challenging proposition because providers may be
operating at diﬀerent layers and in several locations
along an end-to-end path. The network must pro-
vide building blocks that allow users and providers to
determine, and exchange information about, the per-
formance they experience. Such “introspection” capa-
bility of the network also enables innovative network
management and monitoring tools, which themselves
can evolve over time.
These principles are interdependent and mutually rely on
each other. For example, if there are no other alternatives,
there is no need to vote with one’s wallet, nor does it help
to know that the current alternative is not a good one.
3. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
Embracing the three principles discussed above requires
new features and mechanisms not present in the current In-
ternet. Figure 2 illustrates schematically how the principles
interact within a network—which we dub ChoiceNet—and
the new features they support.
As a starting point, one needs support for alterna-
tives, including the ability to create alternatives and select
among them. To support alternatives, ChoiceNet oﬀers new
control-plane mechanisms. More importantly, ChoiceNet in-
troduces a new economy plane that is responsible for sup-
porting the types of business relationships and incentives
that drive innovation and change in the real world. The
economy plane supports advertisement of choices to users,
as well as selection from among a set of alternatives.
Economy plane protocols enable users to negotiate desired
levels of service, and pay (compensate) speciﬁc providers for
services. It also includes mechanisms to help establish the
identity, level of trust, and reputation of the parties involved
in a business relationship.
4. USE SCENARIO
To illustrate the ability of ChoiceNet to support innova-
tion in the network, we brieﬂy describe one use scenario,
highlighting the beneﬁts of choice as a fundamental feature
of the architecture. For this scenario, consider the selection
of connection quality for video distribution.
A user may be oﬀered diﬀerent connection services for the
purpose of watching streaming video. These connections
may diﬀer in their technical implementation (e.g., quality-
of-service, use of caching, etc.). The user selects a service
(i.e., a complete package of end-to-end connection and re-
lated services) and pays for its use. Depending on the user’s
satisfaction with the video experience, they continue to use
the chosen service or switch to another (i.e., vote with their
wallet).
Note that users does not require to have technical exper-
tise in judging low-level networking metrics. They simply
make choices based on their overall experience. Since eco-
nomic rewards are explicitly represented in the architecture,
network service providers are incentivized to create innova-
tive oﬀerings. This approach can therefore drive continued
innovation throughout the network.
