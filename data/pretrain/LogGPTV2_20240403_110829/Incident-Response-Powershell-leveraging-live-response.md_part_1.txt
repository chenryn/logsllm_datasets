This is it, the last part of the Incident Response series. In the past
weeks, insight was given on how KQL can be used to perform incident
response, even if the data is not ingested in Sentinel or Microsoft 365
Defender. Part three marks the last part which discusses how you can
leverage Live Response, which is available in Defender For Endpoint.
The incident response series consists of the following parts:
1.  **Incident Response Part 1: [IR on Microsoft Security Incidents (KQL
    edition)](https://kqlquery.com/posts/kql-incident-response/){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreffer"}**
2.  **Incident Response Part 2: [What about the other
    logs?](https://kqlquery.com/posts/kql-incident-response-everything-else/){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreffer"}**
3.  **Incident Response Part 3: Leveraging Live Response**
# Introduction
To explain the value and the needs around Live Response the following
items will be addressed:
-   [Permissions](#permissions){rel=""}
-   [Live Response Commands](#live-response-commands){rel=""}
    -   [Basic](#basic-commands){rel=""}
    -   [Advanced](#advanced-commands){rel=""}
    -   [Practical Examples](#practical-examples){rel=""}
-   [Incident Response Scripts](#incident-response-scripts){rel=""}
    -   [DFIR Script](#dfir-script){rel=""}
    -   [Community Scripts](#community-scripts){rel=""}
-   [Conclusion](#conclusion){rel=""}
Live Response provides security teams with a remote toolkit that enables
you to perform additional incident response activities on a device. This
provides security teams with a remote shell connection on the device
that needs to be investigated.
The Operating Systems that currently support Live Response are:
-   Windows 10 & 11
-   macOS
-   Linux
-   Windows Server
Before you can use Live Response it needs to be
[enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/advanced-features?view=o365-worldwide#live-response){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"} in the Advanced feature tab of the Defender For
Endpoint settings, as seen below.

data-src="/images/live-response/LiveResponseSetting.png"
data-srcset="/images/live-response/LiveResponseSetting.png, /images/live-response/LiveResponseSetting.png 1.5x, /images/live-response/LiveResponseSetting.png 2x"
data-sizes="auto"}
Once Live Response is enabled and the proper roles are assigned, the
analyst can initiate a *Live Response Session* from the device actions,
as seen below.

data-src="/images/live-response/Connection.png"
data-srcset="/images/live-response/Connection.png, /images/live-response/Connection.png 1.5x, /images/live-response/Connection.png 2x"
data-sizes="auto"}
# Permissions
The [RBAC
model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/user-roles?view=o365-worldwide){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreffer"} in Defender For Endpoint has a specific section
for *Live Response Capabilities*, which are based on the commands an
analyst can run:
-   [Basic](#basic-commands){rel=""}
-   [Advanced](#advanced-commands){rel=""}
Those RBAC rules can be assigned to specific DeviceGroup. I advise using
those DeviceGroups to only assign the least privileges (as you should do
for all roles) thus the least devices an analyst can perform Live
Response on.
Remember that Live Response is a remote shell on an endpoint, so what
could go wrong? Limit the accounts that can perform *Advanced Commands*
on devices, since it has the option to run PowerShell scripts from the
library, but if you can run one, you can also add one (hey red team!).
So in theory you can upload custom scripts to tier0 devices and do a lot
of damage, so be aware of this. There is an option in MDE that is off by
default but can be turned on which lets you run unsigned PowerShell
scripts. As also said in the Microsoft docs: *Allowing the use of
unsigned scripts may increase your exposure to threats.*

# Live Response Commands
Microsoft has documented all the commands that can be executed via Live
Response. The tables below go over what the syntax is, what the command
does and which platforms support the command.

  putfile     Puts a file from the library to the device. Files are saved in a working folder and are deleted when the device restarts by default.

  remediate   Remediates an entity on the device. The remediation action will vary depending on the entity type: File: delete Process: stop, delete image file Service: stop, delete image file Registry entry: delete Scheduled task: remove Startup folder item: delete file NOTE: This command has a prerequisite command. You can use the -auto command in conjunction with remediate to automatically run the prerequisite command.   Y                            Y       Y
  scan        Runs an antivirus scan to help identify and remediate malware.

## Practical Examples
Once a Live Response session is initiated on a device the fun can begin.
You know that you have established a successful connection with the
device if the connect status returns *Session established*, as seen in
the image below. The Live Response prompt provides some additional
information about the device, such as its IP, which OS it is running and
some data related to the Live Response session. This section will
discuss some examples, Microsoft has documented more examples

### Fileinfo
The fileinfo command gets information about a file, awhich OSn example
of the execution is seen below. You need to use the *cd* command to
change to the folder you are interested in. This lists when the file was
created and when it was last modified. Furthermore, a lot of metadata is
shared, for example, if the file is hidden or not. Lastly, the SHA1,
MD5, LSH and SHA256 hashes are shared, which can be used in later stages
to [add them as

### Analyzing files
Based on the file information you might want to analyze the file, which
is also possible. This can be done by running:
::: highlight
``` {tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
analyze file FileName.txt
```
:::
This will again provide some information about the file, but it will
mainly provide the file's behaviour. In the case of this file, MDE
performed two scans on the file:
-   Deep Analysis
-   Microsoft Defender static analysis
Both scans did not find malicious behaviour, resulting in a clean file
status. The last part of the report is the most interesting, it shares
the behaviour of the file. Which connections are made and what file
interactions have been performed.
