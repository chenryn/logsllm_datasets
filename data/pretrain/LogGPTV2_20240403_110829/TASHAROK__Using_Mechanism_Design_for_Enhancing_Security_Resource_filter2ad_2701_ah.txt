which the VCG mechanism achieves the socially optimal allocation

D. Proof of Proposition 4
Proof. From the Proposition statement, the socially optimal
solution would put all the budget B on the first edge (vs, v1),
so that all nodes have a probability of successful attack given
by exp(−B). Now, we prove the first part (i) as follows.
The PNE for behavioral defenders is given by the investment
K on
profile where each defender Dk puts their entire budget B
the edge coming into their node vk (similar to analysis in
Example 2). Therefore, the true cost of defender D1 under
this PNE is L1 exp(− B
K ).
Now, to have defender D1 participate in the mechanism we

This shows the budget deficit under VCG mechanism. Note
that we assume that all defenders have finite budget (when
securing real-world interdependent systems).

Fig. 16: Total loss (in Millions) as a function of the number of
defenders. We observe that the loss increases super-linearly (i.e.,
the per-defender loss is increasing as system size grows). This is
due to the increased risks resulting from interdependencies in the
defenders’ critical assets.
F. Evaluation-Extended
Here, we extend our evaluation presented in Section V.
Specifically, we study the effect of
the asymmetry in
behavioral cognitive bias and asymmetry in edges sensitivities
to security investments across different defenders.
Asymmetry in Cognitive Bias across Defenders: We study
the effect of the asymmetry in behavioral level (cognitive bias)
across different defenders and its effect on the social cost, for
the four case studies we consider in our evaluation. Figure 17a
and Figure 17b shows the result for such experiment for the
DER and SCADA systems, respectively. We observe that the
difference in the social cost is more pronounced with very high
bias asymmetry, e.g., the social cost with α1 = 1, α2 = 0.4
is about 2X the social cost with α1 = 1, α2 = 1 for DER. A
similar insight observed for the SCADA systems. Moreover,
we notice that two defenders with moderate behavioral levels
(α1 = 0.6, α2 = 0.6) would invest better and consequently
better protect the overall system compared to two defenders
with one less behavioral and one more behavioral (with
α1 = 0.8, α2 = 0.4), although the mean behavioral level is
the same in these two cases. This sheds the light on the effect
of suboptimality of behavioral defender on the overall system.
Sensitivity of Edges to Investments: Finally, we consider
the effects of different sensitivities of edges to security
investments. Recall from (2) that edges with higher sensitivity
are those for which the probability of successful attack
decreases faster with each unit of security investment. In
this experiment, for both DER and SCADA systems, we
assume that the defender D1 has lower edges’ sensitivities
to her investments compared to the defender D2. Formally,
we let s1
i,j = 1 (for D2). That
can be mapped into realistic scenario where D1’s methods for
investing on edges are less effective in reducing the probability
of successful attack compared to D2.
i,j = 0.5 (for D1) and s2
For DER system, we show the effect of edges’ sensitivity to
investments on each defender’s real expected loss for different
behavioral levels in Figure 18a. We observe that the defender
with the higher edges’ sensitivity (here, D1) would have
much lower expected loss compared to the defender with
the lower edges’ sensitivity (here, D2) irrespective of the
behavioral level of the defender. However, both defenders
pay zero amount of taxes under all behavioral levels due to
loose interdependency across the two defenders’ subnetworks
in DER (as explained earlier in Section VI).
For SCADA system, we show the effect of sensitivity of
edges to investments on the amount of taxes paid by each
defender under the VCG mechanism. Figure 18b shows that
D2 would receive more amount of payments compared to
D1 for all behavioral levels. The intuition here is that D2
is more beneficial to the society as her investments reduce the
social cost more compared to the investments of D1 (since the
sensitivity of edges to D2’s investments is twice the sensitivity
of edges to D1’s investments). Therefore, under the VCG
mechanism, D2 would receive much more amount due to her
contribution to the society. Moreover, we note that the effect of
edges’ sensitivity is more pronounced under higher behavioral
bias (i.e., less α) and therefore the difference in the amount of
taxes among the two defenders increases as defenders become
more behavioral (since D1 even wastes her budget on edges
that has less sensitivity to those non-critical edges).
