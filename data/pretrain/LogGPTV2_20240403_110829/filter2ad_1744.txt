BIOGRAPHY  
Gene  Tsudik  is  a  Chancellor's  Professor  of  Computer 
Science  at  the  University  of  California,  Irvine  (UCI).  He 
obtained his PhD in Computer Science from USC in 1991. 
Before  coming  to  UCI  in  2000,  he  was  at  IBM  Zurich 
Research  Laboratory  (1991-1996)  and  USC/ISI  (1996-
2000).  Over  the  years,  his  research  interests  included 
numerous  topics  in  security  and  applied  cryptography.. 
Gene Tsudik is a Fulbright Scholar, a Fubright Specialist, a 
fellow  of  ACM, IEEE and AAAS, as  well as a  member of 
Academia Europaea. From 2009 to 2015 he was the Editor-
in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Information and Systems 
Security (TISSEC). 
ABSTRACT 
Genomic  privacy  has  attracted  much  attention  from  the 
research  community,  mainly  since  its  risks  are  unique  and 
breaches can lead to terrifying leakage of most personal and 
sensitive  information.  The  much  less  explored  topic  of 
genomic  security  needs  to  mitigate  threats  of  the  digitized 
genome  being  altered  by  its  owner  or  an  outside  party, 
which can have dire consequences, especially, in medical or 
legal settings. At the same time, many anticipated genomic 
applications  (with  varying  degrees  of  trust)  require  only 
small  amounts  of  genomic  data.  Supporting  such 
applications requires a careful balance between security and 
privacy.  Furthermore,  genome’s  size  raises  performance 
concerns.  
We argue that genomic security must be taken seriously and 
explored as a research topic in its own right. To this end, we 
discuss  the  problem  space,  identify  the  stakeholders, 
discuss assumptions about them, and outline several simple 
approaches  based  on  common  cryptographic  techniques, 
including  signature  variants  and  authenticated  data 
structures.  We  also  present  some  extensions  and  identify 
opportunities  for  future  research.  The  main  goal  of  this 
paper is to highlight the importance of genomic security as 
a research topic in its own right.
