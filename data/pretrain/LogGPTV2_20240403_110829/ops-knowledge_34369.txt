User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题place php errors in log file I am running mac 10.6.4 on an iMac and am using it as a developer server. 

I have Apache and Entropy php5 installed, when i write my applications, some pages wont run when php has errors, however these are not recorded on a log file, I created one php_errors.log and entered the following on the php.ini file

error_log = /usr/local/php5/logs/php_errors.log


However errors are not written to this file and i have 

log_errors = true


What could be the problem

Assistant: In your php.ini you must also set

display_errors = Off
log_errors = true


Then restart your webserver.
