User: I am completely new to python and trying to create an application (or .exe) file for python using pyinstaller. I ran the command pyinstaller -[DIRECTORY].py and it saved it to an output directory "C:\Windows\System32\Dist\Foo", however when i tried to locate the directory it did not seem to exist (Dist). 
NOTE: i'm trying to convert a .py file to .exe file in Python 3.5
Thanks for any help :)
Assistant: If you set your command directory to the .py script location and run pyinstaller yourscript.py, it will generate folders in the same location as your script. The folder named dist/ will contain the .exe file.
