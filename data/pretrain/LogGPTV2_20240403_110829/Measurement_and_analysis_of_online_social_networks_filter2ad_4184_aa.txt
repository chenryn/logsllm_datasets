ABSTRACT
Online social networking sites like Orkut, YouTube, and
Flickr are among the most popular sites on the Internet.
Users of these sites form a social network, which provides
a powerful means of sharing, organizing, and ﬁnding con-
tent and contacts. The popularity of these sites provides
an opportunity to study the characteristics of online social
network graphs at large scale. Understanding these graphs
is important, both to improve current systems and to design
new applications of online social networks.
This paper presents a large-scale measurement study and
analysis of the structure of multiple online social networks.
We examine data gathered from four popular online social
networks: Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. We
crawled the publicly accessible user links on each site, ob-
taining a large portion of each social network’s graph. Our
data set contains over 11.3 million users and 328 million
links. We believe that this is the ﬁrst study to examine
multiple online social networks at scale.
Our results conﬁrm the power-law, small-world, and scale-
free properties of online social networks. We observe that the
indegree of user nodes tends to match the outdegree; that
the networks contain a densely connected core of high-degree
nodes; and that this core links small groups of strongly clus-
tered, low-degree nodes at the fringes of the network. Fi-
nally, we discuss the implications of these structural prop-
erties for the design of social network based systems.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Internet has spawned diﬀerent types of information
sharing systems, including the Web. Recently, online so-
cial networks have gained signiﬁcant popularity and are now
among the most popular sites on the Web [40]. For example,
MySpace (over 190 million users1), Orkut (over 62 million),
LinkedIn (over 11 million), and LiveJournal (over 5.5 mil-
lion) are popular sites built on social networks.
Unlike the Web, which is largely organized around con-
tent, online social networks are organized around users. Par-
ticipating users join a network, publish their proﬁle and any
content, and create links to any other users with whom they
associate. The resulting social network provides a basis for
maintaining social relationships, for ﬁnding users with sim-
ilar interests, and for locating content and knowledge that
has been contributed or endorsed by other users.
An in-depth understanding of the graph structure of on-
line social networks is necessary to evaluate current systems,
to design future online social network based systems, and
to understand the impact of online social networks on the
Internet. For example, understanding the structure of on-
line social networks might lead to algorithms that can de-
tect trusted or inﬂuential users, much like the study of the
Web graph led to the discovery of algorithms for ﬁnding au-
thoritative sources in the Web [21]. Moreover, recent work
has proposed the use of social networks to mitigate email
spam [17], to improve Internet search [35], and to defend
against Sybil attacks [55]. However, these systems have not
yet been evaluated on real social networks at scale, and lit-
tle is known to date on how to synthesize realistic social
network graphs.
In this paper, we present a large-scale (11.3 million users,
328 million links) measurement study and analysis of the
structure of four popular online social networks: Flickr,
YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut. Data gathered from mul-
tiple sites enables us to identify common structural proper-
ties of online social networks. We believe that ours is the
ﬁrst study to examine multiple online social networks at
scale. We obtained our data by crawling publicly accessible
information on these sites, and we make the data available

to the research community.
In contrast, previous studies
have generally relied on propreitary data obtained from the
operators of a single large network [4].
In addition to validating the power-law, small-world and
scale-free properties previously observed in oﬄine social net-
works, we provide insights into online social network struc-
tures. We observe a high degree of reciprocity in directed
user links, leading to a strong correlation between user inde-
gree and outdegree. This diﬀers from content graphs like the
graph formed by Web hyperlinks, where the popular pages
(authorities) and the pages with many references (hubs) are
distinct. We ﬁnd that online social networks contain a large,
strongly connected core of high-degree nodes, surrounded by
many small clusters of low-degree nodes. This suggests that
high-degree nodes in the core are critical for the connectivity
and the ﬂow of information in these networks.
The focus of our work is the social network users within
the sites we study. More speciﬁcally, we study the properties
of the large weakly connected component2 (WCC) in the
user graphs of four popular sites. We do not attempt to
study the entire user community (which would include users
who do not use the social networking features), information
ﬂow, workload, or evolution of online social networking sites.
While these topics are important, they are beyond the scope
of this paper.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We provide
additional background on social networks in Section 2 and
detail related work in Section 3. We describe our methodol-
ogy for crawling these networks, and its limitations, in Sec-
tion 4. We examine structural properties of the networks in
Section 5, and discuss the implications in Section 6. Finally,
we conclude in Section 7.
2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
We begin with a brief overview of online social networks. We
then describe a simple experiment we conducted to estimate
how often the links between users are used to locate content
in a social networking site like Flickr. Finally, we discuss the
importance of understanding the structure of online social
networks.
Online social networks have existed since the beginning of
the Internet. For instance, the graph formed by email users
who exchange messages with each other forms an online so-
cial network. However, it has been diﬃcult to study this
network at large scale due to its distributed nature.
Popular online social networking sites like Flickr, You-
Tube, Orkut, and LiveJournal rely on an explicit user graph
to organize, locate, and share content as well as contacts.
In many of these sites, links between users are public and
can be crawled automatically to capture and study a large
fraction of the connected user graph. These sites present an
opportunity to measure and study online social networks at
a large scale.
2.1 Online social networking sites
Online social networking sites are usually run by individual
corporations (e.g. Google and Yahoo!), and are accessible
via the Web.
2A weakly connected component in a directed graph is a set
of nodes where each node in the set has a path to every other
node in the set if all links are viewed as undirected.
Users. To participate fully in an online social network, users
must register with a site, possibly under a pseudonym.3
Some sites allow browsing of public data without explicit
sign-up. Users may volunteer information about themselves
(e.g., their birthday, place of residence, or interests), which
is added to the user’s proﬁle.
Links. The social network is composed of user accounts and
links between users. Some sites (e.g. Flickr, LiveJournal)
allow users to link to any other user, without consent from
the link target. Other sites (e.g. Orkut, LinkedIn) require
consent from both the creator and target before a link is
created connecting these users.
Users form links for one of several reasons. The nodes
connected by a link can be real-world acquaintances, online
acquaintances, or business contacts; they can share an in-
terest; or they can be interested in each other’s contributed
content. Some users even see the acquisition of many links
as a goal in itself [14]. User links in social networks can serve
the purpose of both hyperlinks and bookmarks in the Web.
A user’s links, along with her proﬁle, are visible to those
who visit the user’s account. Thus, users are able to explore
the social network by following user-to-user links, brows-
ing the proﬁle information and any contributed content of
visited users as they go. Certain sites, such as LinkedIn,
only allow a user to browse other user accounts within her
neighborhood (i.e. a user can only view other users that are
within two hops in the social network); other sites, includ-
ing the ones we study, allow users to view any other user
account in the system.
Groups. Most sites enable users to create and join special
interest groups. Users can post messages to groups and up-
load shared content to the group. Certain groups are mod-
erated; admission to such a group and postings to a group
are controlled by a user designated as the group’s modera-
tor. Other groups are unrestricted, allowing any member to
join and post messages or content.
2.1.1 Is the social network used in locating content?
Of the four popular social networking sites we study in this
paper, only Orkut is a “pure” social networking site, in the
sense that the primary purpose of the site is ﬁnding and con-
necting to new users. Others are intended primarily for pub-
lishing, organizing, and locating content; Flickr, YouTube,
and LiveJournal are used for sharing photographs, videos,
and blogs, respectively.
To investigate the role played by the social network in or-
ganizing and locating content, we conducted a simple mea-
surement of how users browse the Flickr system. We ana-
lyzed the HTTP requests going to the flickr.com domain
from a 55-day HTTP trace taken at the border routers of
the Technical University of Munich between August 17th,
2006 and October 11th, 2006. We found 22,215 photo views
from at least 1,056 distinct users. For each of these views,
we examined the browser’s click stream to determine what
action led the user to a given photo.
We found that 17,897 of the views (80.6%) resulted ei-
ther from following links in the Flickr user graph or were
3In the rest of this paper, we use the term “user” to de-
note a single unique identity in a social network. A person
may create multiple identities, and may even create links be-
tween these identities. We consider each of these identities
as separate users.
additional views within a visited user’s collection. In other
words, in 80.6% of the views, the user network was involved
in browsing content. We count these views as being inﬂu-
enced by the social network. Focusing on the remaining
views, 1,418 (6.3%) views were the result of using the Flickr
photo search facilities. The remaining 2,900 (13.1%) views
were the result of a link from an external source, such as
links from an external site or links received via email. Nei-
ther of the latter sets of views involved the social network.
Our experiment suggests that the social network in Flickr
plays an important role in locating content. Four out of ﬁve
photos were located by traversing the social network links.
2.2 Why study social networks?
Online social networks are already at the heart of some very
popular Web sites. As the technology matures, more ap-
plications are likely to emerge. It is also likely that social
networking will play an important role in future personal
and commercial online interaction, as well as the location
and organization of information and knowledge. Examples
include browser plug-ins to discover information viewed by
friends [39, 50], and social network based, cooperative Web
search tools [35]. Even major Web search companies are de-
ploying services that leverage social networks, like Yahoo!’s
MyWeb 2.0 [54] and Google Co-op [19].
Below, we outline a few of the ways is which an under-
standing of the structure of online social networks can ben-
eﬁt the design of new systems and help us understand the
impact of online social networks on the future Internet. Ad-
ditionally, we speculate how our data might be of interest to
researchers in other disciplines.
2.2.1 Shared interest and trust
Adjacent users in a social network tend to trust each other.
A number of research systems have been proposed to ex-
ploit this trust. SybilGuard [55] uses a social network to
detect Sybil attacks in distributed systems, leveraging the
fact that Sybil users will not be able to create many trust
links to non-Sybil users. Re [17] exploits the trust between
email users to aid spam classiﬁcation by whitelisting mes-
sages from friends and friends-of-friends. We believe that a
deeper understanding of the underlying topology is an es-
sential ﬁrst step in the design and analysis of robust trust
and reputation metrics for these systems.
Adjacent users in a social network also tend to have com-
mon interests. Users browse neighboring regions of their
social network because they are likely to ﬁnd content that is
of interest to them. Systems such as Yahoo! My Web [54],
Google Co-op [19], and PeerSpective [35] use social networks
to rank Internet search results relative to the interests of
a user’s neighborhood in the social network. These sys-
tems observe content viewed and search results clicked on
by members of a social network in order to better rank the
results of the user’s future searches.
Understanding the structure of online social networks, as
well as the processes that shape them, is important for these
applications. It would be useful to have eﬃcient algorithms
to infer the actual degree of shared interest between two
users, or the reliability of a user (as perceived by other
users). With respect to security, it is important to under-
stand the robustness of such networks to deliberate attempts
of manipulation. These topics are beyond the scope of this
paper; however, a fundamental understanding of online so-
cial network structure is likely to be a necessary ﬁrst step in
these directions.
2.2.2 Impact on future Internet
The social networks we study in this paper exist in the
databases of online social networking sites. However, other
online social networks are implemented as overlay networks.
For instance, the graph formed by people who exchange
email, or the graph formed by Skype [49] users who include
each other in their contact lists can be viewed as another
social network on top of the Internet. If future distributed
online social networks are popular and bandwidth-intensive,
they can have a signiﬁcant impact on Internet traﬃc, just as
current peer-to-peer content distribution networks do. Un-
derstanding the structure of online social networks is not
only critical to understanding the robustness and security of
distributed online social networks, but also to understanding
their impact on the future Internet.
2.2.3 Impact on other disciplines
Additionally, our work has relevance beyond computer sci-
ence. To social scientists, online social networks oﬀer an un-
precedented opportunity to study social networks at a large
scale. Sociologists can examine our data to test existing the-
ories about oﬄine social networks, as well as to look for new
forms of behavior in online social networks.
Studying the structure of online social networks may help
improve the understanding of online campaigning and viral
marketing. Political campaigns have realized the importance
of blogs in elections [47]. Similarly, marketing experts are
experimenting with paid viral marketing [44] to better pro-
mote products and companies. Regardless of one’s stance on
these phenomena, a better understanding of the structure of
social networks is likely to improve our understanding of the
opportunities, limitations, and threats associated with these
ideas.
3. RELATED WORK
In this section we describe studies of social networks, in-
formation networks, as well as work on complex network
theory.
3.1 Social networks
Sociologists have studied many of the properties of social
networks. Milgram [34] shows that the average path length
between two Americans is 6 hops, and Pool and Kochen [46]
provide an analysis of the small-world eﬀect. The inﬂuential
paper by Granovetter [20] argues that a social network can
be partitioned into ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ ties, and that the
strong ties are tightly clustered. For an overview of social
network analysis techniques, we refer the reader to the book
by Wasserman and Faust [51].
As online social networks are gaining popularity, sociol-
ogists and computer scientists are beginning to investigate
their properties. Adamic et al. [3] study an early online
social network at Stanford University, and ﬁnd that the net-
work exhibits small-world behavior, as well as signiﬁcant
local clustering. Liben-Nowell et al. [32] ﬁnd a strong cor-
relation between friendship and geographic location in so-
cial networks by using data from LiveJournal. Kumar et
al. [26] examine two online social networks and ﬁnd that
both possess a large strongly connected component. Girvan
and Newman observe that users in online social networks
tend to form tightly knit groups [18]. Backstrom et al. [8]
examine snapshots of group membership in LiveJournal, and
present models for the growth of user groups over time. We
were able to verify these properties on a much larger scale.
In recent work, Ahn et al. [4] analyze complete data from a
large South Korean social networking site (Cyworld), along
with data from small sample crawls of MySpace and Orkut.
The authors obtained data directly from CyWorld opera-
tors, and the volume of available data allows the authors
to conduct an in-depth study of that site using some of the
same metrics that we use in this paper. The comparison
with diﬀerent networks, on the other hand, is limited by the
small crawled data samples of MySpace and Orkut. Our
study is largely complementary: the data available to us for
any one site is less detailed, but we are able to compare large
crawled data sets from multiple sites.
3.2 Information networks
A long thread of research examines the structure of com-
plex networks like the Web and the Internet. A prominent
study of the Web link structure [12] shows that the Web has
a “bow-tie” shape, consisting of a single large strongly con-
nected component4 (SCC), and other groups of nodes that
can either reach the SCC or can be reached from the SCC.
We show that online social networks have a similar large
component, but that its relative size is much larger than
that of the Web’s SCC. Faloutsos et al. [16] show that the
degree distribution of the Internet follows a power-law, and
Siganos et al. demonstrate that the high-level structure of
the Internet resembles a “jellyﬁsh” [48].
Kleinberg [24] demonstrates that high-degree pages in the
Web can be identiﬁed by their function as either hubs (con-
taining useful references on a subject) or authorities (con-
taining relevant information on a subject). Kleinberg also
presents an algorithm [21] for inferring which pages function
as hubs and which as authorities. The well-known PageRank
algorithm [43] uses the Web structure to determine pages
that contain authoritative information.
3.3 Complex network theory
There has been much theoretical work on the properties of
various classes of complex graphs.
Random networks have been extensively studied, starting
with the seminal paper by Erd¨os and R´eyni [15]. These
graphs are usually constructed by randomly adding links
to a static set of nodes. Researchers have shown that ran-
dom graphs tend to have very short paths between any two
nodes [25]. More recent work on random graphs has pro-
