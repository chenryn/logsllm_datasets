Hack 41. Create your own prompt using the available
codes for PS1 variable
Use the following codes and create your own personal PS1 Linux prompt that
is functional and suites your taste.
o \a an ASCII bell character (07)
o \d the date in “Weekday Month Date” format (e.g., “Tue May
26″)
o \D{format} - the format is passed to strftime(3) and the result is
inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a
locale-specific time representation. The braces are required
o \e an ASCII escape character (033)
59
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
o \h the hostname up to the first part
o \H the hostname
o \j the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
o \l the basename of the shell’s terminal device name
o \n newline
o \r carriage return
o \s the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion
following the final slash)
o \t the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
o \T the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
o \@ the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
o \A the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
o \u the username of the current user
o \v the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
o \V the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
o \w the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a
tilde
o \W the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME
abbreviated with a tilde
o \! the history number of this command
o \# the command number of this command
o \$ if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
o \nnn the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
o \\ a backslash
o \[ begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be
used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
60
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
o \] end a sequence of non-printing character
Hack 42. Use bash shell function inside PS1 variable
You can also invoke a bash shell function in the PS1 as shown below.
ramesh@dev-db ~> function httpdcount {
> ps aux | grep httpd | grep -v grep | wc -l
> }
ramesh@dev-db ~> export PS1="\u@\h [`httpdcount`]> "
ramesh@dev-db [12]>
[Note: This displays the total number of running httpd
processes]
You can add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc to make
this change permanent:
$ vi .bash_profile
function httpdcount {
ps aux | grep httpd | grep -v grep | wc -l
}
export PS1='\u@\h [`httpdcount`]> '
Hack 43. Use shell script inside PS1 variable
You can also invoke a shell script inside the PS1 variable. In the example
below, the ~/bin/totalfilesize.sh, which calculates the total filesize of the
current directory, is invoked inside the PS1 variable.
ramesh@dev-db ~> cat ~/bin/totalfilesize.sh
61
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
for filesize in $(ls -l . | grep "^-" | awk '{print
$5}')
do
let totalsize=$totalsize+$filesize
done
echo -n "$totalsize"
ramesh@dev-db ~> export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
ramesh@dev-db ~> export PS1="\u@\h
[\$(totalfilesize.sh) bytes]> "
ramesh@dev-db [534 bytes]> cd /etc/mail
ramesh@dev-db [167997 bytes]>
[Note: This executes the totalfilesize.sh to display
the total file size of the current directory in the PS1
prompt]

Hack 45. Advanced compression using zip command.
There are 10 levels of compression provided by zip command.
o Level 0 is the lowest level, where it just archives the file without
any compression.
o Level 1 will perform little compression. But, will be very fast.
o Level 6 is the default level of compression.
o Level 9 is the maximum compression. This will be slower when
compared to default level. In my opinion, unless you are
compressing a huge file, you should always use level 9.
In the example below, I used Level 0, default Level 6, and Level 9
compression on a same directory. See the compressed file size yourself.
# zip var-log-files-default.zip /var/log/*
# zip -0 var-log-files-0.zip /var/log/*
# zip -9 var-log-files-9.zip /var/log/*
# ls -ltr

Hack 46. Password Protection of Zip files
Pass the option –P to the zip command to assign a password to the zip file.
# zip -P mysecurepwd var-log-protected.zip /var/log/*
The above option is good if you are using the command inside a shell-script
for background jobs. However, when you are performing the compression
interactively on the command-line, you don’t want the password to be visible
in the history. So, use the option –e as shown below to assign the password.
# zip -e var-log-protected.zip /var/log/*
Enter password:
Verify password:
updating: var/log/acpid (deflated 81%)
updating: var/log/anaconda.log (deflated 79%)
When you are uncompressing a password protected file, it will ask for the
password as shown below.
# unzip var-log-protected.zip
Archive: var-log-protected.zip

Hack 48. Tar Command Basics
tar command (tape archive) is used to convert a group of files into an
archive.
Syntax: tar [options] [tar-archive-name] [other-file-
names]
How can I create a single backup file of all files and subdirectories
under my home directory?
The following command creates a single archive backup file called
my_home_directory.tar under /tmp. This archive will contain all the files and
subdirectories under /home/jsmith.
o Option c, stands for create an archive.
o Option v stands for verbose mode, displays additional information
while executing the command.
o Option f indicates the archive file name mentioned in the command.
# tar cvf /tmp/my_home_directory.tar /home/jsmith
67
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
How do I view all the files inside the tar archive?
Option t will display all the files from the tar archive.
# tar tvf /tmp/my_home_directory.tar
How do I extract all the files from a tar archive?
Option x will extract the files from the tar archive as shown below. This will
extract the content to the current directory location from where the
command is executed.
# tar xvf /tmp/my_home_directory.tar
How do I extract tar.gz files to a specific directory?
# tar xvfz /tmp/my_home_directory.tar.gz –C

# tar cvfz /tmp/my_home_directory.tar.gz /home/jsmith
# tar xvfz /tmp/my_home_directory.tar.gz
# tar tvfz /tmp/my_home_directory.tar.gz
Note: Using gzip is faster when compared to bzip2.

Chapter 8: Command Line History
When you are using Linux command line frequently, using the history
effectively can be a major productivity boost. In fact, once you have
mastered the 15 examples that I’ve provided here, you’ll find using command
line more enjoyable and fun.
Hack 50. Display TIMESTAMP in history using
HISTTIMEFORMAT
Typically when you type history from command line, it displays the
command# and the command. For auditing purpose, it may be beneficial to
display the timestamp along with the command as shown below.
# export HISTTIMEFORMAT=’%F %T ‘
# history | more
1 2008-08-05 19:02:39 service network restart
2 2008-08-05 19:02:39 exit
3 2008-08-05 19:02:39 id
4 2008-08-05 19:02:39 cat /etc/redhat-release
Note: You can also setup the following alias to view the recent history
commands.
alias h1='history 10'
alias h2='history 20'
alias h3='history 30'
Hack 51. Search the history using Control+R
I strongly believe that this may be your most frequently used feature of
history. When you’ve already executed a very long command, you can simply
70
Linux 101 Hacks www.thegeekstuff.com
search history using a keyword and re-execute the same command without
having to type it fully. Press Control+R and type the keyword.
In the following example, I searched for red, which displayed the previous
command “cat /etc/redhat-release” in the history that contained the word
red.
# [Note: Press Ctrl+R from the command prompt, which
will display the reverse-i-search prompt as shown
below]
(reverse-i-search)`red‘: cat /etc/redhat-release
[Note: Press enter when you see your command, which
will execute the command from the history]
# cat /etc/redhat-release
Fedora release 9 (Sulphur)
Sometimes you want to edit a command from history before executing it. For
e.g. you can search for httpd, which will display service httpd stop from the
command history, select this command and change the stop to start and re-
execute it again as shown below.
# [Note: Press Ctrl+R from the command prompt, which
will display the reverse-i-search prompt]
(reverse-i-search)`httpd‘: service httpd stop
[Note: Press either left arrow or right arrow key when
you see your command, which will display the command
for you to edit, before executing it]
# service httpd start

Hack 52. Repeat previous command quickly using 4
different methods
Sometime you may end up repeating the previous commands for various
reasons. Following are the 4 different ways to repeat the last executed
command.
1. Use the up arrow to view the previous command and press enter
to execute it.
2. Type !! and press enter from the command line
3. Type !-1 and press enter from the command line.
4. Press Control+P will display the previous command, press enter
to execute it
Hack 53. Execute a specific command from history
In the following example, If you want to repeat the command #4, execute !4
as shown below.
# history | more
1 service network restart
2 exit
3 id
