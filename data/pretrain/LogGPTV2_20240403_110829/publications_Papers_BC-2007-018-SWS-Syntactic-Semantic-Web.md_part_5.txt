infrastructure indispensable for education. They provide an essential resource for
students and researchers for reference and for research. Metadata has been used in
libraries for centuries. For example, the two most common general classification
systems, which use metadata, are the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system and
the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) system. The DDC system has 10 major
subjects, each with 10 secondary subjects (DDC 2005). The LCC system uses letters
instead of numbers to organize materials into 21 general branches of knowledge. The 21
subject categories are further divided into more specific subject areas by adding one or
two additional letters and numbers (LCCS 2005).
As traditional libraries are increasingly converting to digital libraries, a new set of
requirements has emerged. One important feature of digital libraries is the ability to
efficiently browse electronic catalogues browsed. This requires the use of common
metadata to describe the records of the catalogue (such as author, title, and publisher)
and common controlled vocabularies to allow subject identifiers to be assigned to
publications. The use of a common controlled vocabulary, thesauri, and taxonomy
(Smrz, Sinopalnikova et al. 2003) allows search engines to ensure that the most relevant
items of information are returned. Semantically annotating the contents of a digital
library’s database goes beyond the use of a controlled vocabulary, thesauri, or
taxonomy. It allows retrieving books’ records using meaningful information to the
existing full text and bibliographic descriptions.
Semantic Web technologies, such as RDF and OWL, can be used as a common
interchange format for catalogue metadata and shared vocabulary, which can be used by
all libraries and search engines (Shum, Motta et al. 2000) across the Web. This is
important since it is not uncommon to find library systems based on various metadata
formats and built by different persons for their special purposes. By publishing
ontologies, which can then be accessed by all users across the Web, library catalogues
can use the same vocabularies for cataloguing, marking up items with the most relevant
terms for the domain of interest. RDF and OWL provide a single and consistent
encoding system so that implementers of digital library metadata systems will have their
task simplified when interoperating with other digital library systems.
Semantic grid. The concept of Grid (Foster and Kesselman 1999) has been proposed as
a fundamental computing infrastructure to support the vision of e-Science. The Grid is a
service for sharing computer power and data storage capacity over the Internet and goes
well beyond simple communication providing functionalities that enable the rapid
assembly and disassembly of services into temporary groups.
Recently, the Grid has been evolving towards the Semantic Grid to yield an
intelligent platform which allows process automation, knowledge sharing and reuse, and
collaboration within a community (Roure, Jennings et al. 2001). The Semantic Grid is
about the use of semantic Web technologies in Grid computing; it is an extension of the
current Grid. The objective is to describe information, computing resources, and
services in standard ways that can be processed by computers. Resources and services

are represented using the technologies of the semantic Web, such as RDF. The use of
semantics to locate data has important implications for integrating computing resources.
It implies a two-step access to resources. In step one, a search of metadata catalogues is
used to find the resources containing the data or service required by an application. In
the second step, the data or service is accessed or invoked.
Semantic Web Search. Swoogle (Swoogle 2005) is a crawler-based indexing and
retrieval system for the semantic Web built on top of the Google API. It was developed
in the context of a research project of the Ebiquity research group at the Computer
Science and Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Maryland, USA. In
contrast to Google (Google 2005), Swoogle discovers, analyzes, and indexes Semantic
Web Documents (SWD) written in RDF and OWL, rather than plain HTML documents.
Documents are indexed using metadata about classes, properties, and individuals, as
well as the relationships among them. Unlike traditional search engines, Swoogle aims
to take advantage of the semantic metadata available in semantic Web documents.
Metadata is extracted for each discovered document and relations (e.g. similarities)
among documents are computed. Swoogle also defines an ontology ranking property for
SWD which is similar to the pageRank (Brin and Page 1998) approach from Google
and uses this information to sort search results. Swoogle provides query interfaces and
services to Web users. It supports software agents, programs via service interfaces, and
researchers working in the semantic Web area via the Web interface.
Semantic Bioinformatic Systems. The integration of information sources in the life
sciences is one of the most challenging goals of bioinformatics (Kumar and Smith
2004). In this area, the Gene Ontology (GO) is one of the most significant
accomplishments. The objective of GO is to supply a mechanism to guarantee the
consistent descriptions of gene products in different databases. GO is rapidly acquiring
the status of a de facto standard in the field of gene and gene product annotations
(Kumar and Smith 2004). The GO effort includes the development of controlled
vocabularies that describe gene products, establishing associations between the
ontologies, the genes, and the gene products in the databases, and develop tools to
create, maintain, and use ontologies (see http://www.geneontology.org/). GO has over
17,000 terms and it is organized in three hierarchies for molecular functions, cellular
components, and biological processes (Bodenreider, Aubry et al. 2005).
Another well-known life science ontology is the Microarray Gene Expression Data
(MGED) ontology. MGED provides standard terms in the form of an ontology
organized into classes with properties for the annotation of microarray experiments
(MGED 2005). These terms provide an unambiguous description of how experiments
were performed and enable structured queries of elements of the experiments. The
comparison between different experiments is only feasible if there is standardization in
the terminology for describing experimental setup, mathematical post-processing of raw
measurements, genes, tissues, and samples. The adoption of common standards by the
research community for describing data makes it possible to develop systems for the
management, storage, transfer, mining, and sharing of microarray data (Stoeckert,
Causton et al. 2002). If data from every microarray experiment carried out by different
research groups were stored with the same structure, in the same type of database, the
manipulation of data would be relatively easy. Unfortunately, in practice, different
research groups have very different requirements and, therefore, applications need
mappings and translations between the different existing formats (Stoeckert, Causton et
al. 2002).

7 Conclusions
Since its creation, the World Wide Web has allowed computers only to understand Web
page layout for display purposes without having access to their intended meaning. The
semantic Web aims to enrich the existing Web with a layer of machine-understandable
metadata to enable the automatic processing of information by computer programs. The
semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which
information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to
work in cooperation. To make possible the creation of the semantic Web the W3C
(World Wide Web Consortium) has been actively working on the definition of open
standards, such as the RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web
Ontology Language), and incentivate their use by both industry and academia. These
standards are also important for the integration and interoperability for intra- and inter-
business processes that have become widespread due to the development of business-to-
business and business-to-customer infrastructures.
The semantic Web does not restrict itself to the formal semantic description of Web
resources for machine-to-machine exchange and automated integration and processing.
One important feature of formally describing resources is to allow computers to reason
by inference. Once resources are described using facts, associations, and relationships,
inference engines, also called reasoners, can derive new knowledge and draw logical
conclusions from existing information. The use of inference engines in the semantic
Web allows applications to inquire why a particular logical conclusion has been
reached, i.e. semantic applications can give proof of their conclusions by explaining the
steps involved in logical reasoning.
Even though the semantic Web is still in its infancy, there are already applications
and tools that use this conceptual approach to build semantic Web based systems,
ranging from the use of semantic Web services, semantic integration of tourism
information sources, and semantic digital libraries to the development of bioinformatics
ontologies.
