Here's a demonstration of the issue:  
http://jsfiddle.net/phillipadsmith/5qS9d/
If you double-click a button that is not the active button, the post values
for that button-group are not sent with the post body.
To test:
  * Use the fiddle above
  * Double-click on the buttons
  * Hit "finish," then check the request bin: http://requestb.in/vb0id1vb?inspect
You'll see an empty post body.
I've been struggling to figure out this bug for a week, as I noticed it in a
production app. Some users received form validation errors and there was no
rhyme or reason as to why (as far as browser/os/etc.).
Then I thought of my mom! She double-clicks her way around the Web. Tested
that in all browsers, and -- in each case -- the buttons don't send any post
value if double-clicked.
Let me know if you have any questions.
