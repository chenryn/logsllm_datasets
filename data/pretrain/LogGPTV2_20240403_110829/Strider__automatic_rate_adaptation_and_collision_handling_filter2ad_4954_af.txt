### Implementation Details

For both Strider and SoftRate, the emulator implements an 802.11-style MAC with ACKs, CSMA, and exponential backoff using default parameters. Additionally, soft decoding is implemented for SoftRate to estimate Bit Error Rate (BER) at the receiver.

### Simulating Mobility

To simulate different levels of mobility, we replay the trace at varying speeds. For example, a 4x increase in mobility means that channel measurements spanning T seconds now span T/4 seconds. When a packet is transmitted at time t in the simulation, the symbols in the packet are distorted using the corresponding channel measurement from the trace at time t. If the trace has been sped up 4x to simulate higher mobility, the channel measurement at time t in the new trace will be the channel measurement in the original trace at time 4t.

### Simulating Contention

To vary contention, we select different subsets of the 10 nodes from the contention trace and allow them to send packets whenever the simulated 802.11 MAC permits. If a node is allowed to transmit at time t, we look up the channel measurements from its trace at time t and distort its transmitted symbols accordingly. In the event of a collision, the symbols from each node are individually distorted according to their respective channel traces, and the distorted symbols are summed at the receiver.

### Performance with Mobility

We compare the performance of Strider under varying levels of mobility, as shown in Figure 6(A). The figure plots the average normalized throughput for the two schemes versus simulated speeds, including error bars. Strider performs excellently, though it does show some drop-off with increasing mobility compared to the omniscient scheme. At high mobility, Strider's performance is around 15% lower than the omniscient scheme. However, Strider still outperforms SoftRate by nearly 70% in vehicular mobility scenarios and by 50% in very fast fading scenarios.

### Low Contention

In low contention scenarios, we randomly select two nodes from the contention traces and simulate an 802.11 network where both nodes communicate with an Access Point (AP). We run the simulation for 100 seconds. If the two nodes are hidden terminals, they cannot carrier sense each other. Among the 10C2 pairs in our traces, only 12 pairs are hidden terminals. The omniscient scheme uses a collision-free scheduler, scheduling concurrent transmissions one after the other to eliminate collisions. We compute the average total throughput for each two-node scenario and repeat for different two-node scenarios. Figure 6(B) shows the CDF of throughputs for the three compared schemes.

**Analysis:**
Strider outperforms even the omniscient scheme in low contention scenarios, with a median rate gain of around 25% over the omniscient scheme and 35% over SoftRate. SoftRate performs poorly in about 15% of the simulations due to hidden terminal issues. At low mobility, all schemes perform well because the channel coherence time is relatively long, allowing rate adaptation algorithms to lock onto the correct bitrate. As mobility increases, SoftRate's performance drops and then recovers in very high mobility scenarios, likely due to its ability to average the channel over packet transmission times and accurately estimate BER.

### High Contention

In high contention scenarios, we select increasing numbers of contending nodes from our contention traces. We normalize the throughput of each experiment by dividing it by the throughput achieved by the omniscient scheme and calculate the average normalized throughput across all experiments with the same number of contending nodes. Figure 6(C) shows the results with increasing contention.

**Analysis:**
Strider significantly outperforms both the omniscient scheme and SoftRate as contention increases. With 8 nodes contending, Strider is nearly 60% better than the omniscient scheme and 2.8x better than SoftRate. The reasons for this superior performance include:
- **Efficient Medium Utilization:** Strider ensures that every node gets an equal amount of channel time, regardless of its channel quality.
- **Collision Resilience:** Strider can decode from collisions and eliminate hidden terminal problems, whereas SoftRate suffers from frequent collisions and expensive backoffs.
- **Stale Bitrate Estimates:** In high contention, SoftRate's reliance on feedback from previous packet ACKs leads to stale bitrate estimates and a loss in throughput.

### Conclusion

Strider provides a rateless and collision-resilient design, consistently achieving good performance across a wide range of scenarios, from low to high mobility and from low to high contention. It simplifies wireless PHY design by eliminating the need for complex rate adaptation protocols. Future work includes redesigning the MAC to leverage Strider's collision-resilient code and extending it to 802.11n MIMO scenarios.
