### Password Security Analysis and User Behavior

#### 1. Entropy and Compromise Rates
The fully elicited entropy for the weakest allowed password in our university is 48.43 bits. Given that the minimum required entropy is 50 bits, we estimate that 2.59% of Engineering accounts and 2.92% of School of Education accounts may be compromised after approximately 3.8 × 10^14 guesses.

If the attacker's brute force capacity is increased to 60 bits (10^18 guesses), the expected proportion of compromised accounts rises to 36% for Engineering and 44% for the School of Education. In both scenarios, passwords from the School of Education are 1.13 and 1.22 times more likely to be guessed compared to those from the Engineering department.

#### 2. Password Change Time Series by Relationship
In addition to analyzing password strength by school or faculty, we also examined the roles of individuals within the university. The evolution of password strength over time for different user groups is shown in Figure 10. Relationships with fewer than 5,000 or 2% of total password changes/resets were excluded. As with the previous graph, all user groups show an upward trend in password strength over time. There are significant variations between groups, with Teaching/Research staff having passwords that are 21 days stronger than Postgraduate students.

A linear regression was performed to predict password strength based on relationship types. Each type of relationship contributed significantly, explaining 89% of the variance (R² = 0.893, F(13,12559) = 7957, p < 10^-10). The results align with the hypotheses in Section 3: there is a positive correlation between password strength and the perceived value of the account, and a negative correlation between password strength and frequency of use. For example, Teaching/Research staff, who use their accounts to access research and teaching data, have the highest average password strength.

Administrative staff also value their account security but have a high frequency of use, which may moderate their password strength. Alumni, with low account usage, may perceive the cost of a forgotten password as higher, leading to longer password expiration times.

#### 3. Response to Policy Change
The results answer our initial research questions: users have gradually adapted to the new policy, increasing their password lifetime. After 14 months, the password strength of all user groups has not yet plateaued. We identified differences in how users react to the policy change by analyzing the evolution of password strength across different subgroups (roles and divisions).

#### 4. User Feedback
We present a preliminary summary of field notes from interviews with 93 participants, providing insights into factors influencing password construction and use. A few participants reported changing their password habits, such as using a password manager or writing down their password. Many appreciated the flexibility of the new policy, but some did not explore the differences between the old and new systems. Participants were split on whether passwords should expire or remain valid indefinitely.

There was an even split among interviewees regarding the link between password age and strength. Data shows that, a year after deployment, users' average password strength has not stabilized (Figure 8). Some saw the new system as an incentive to create stronger passwords, while others found it difficult to create a valid password labeled as 'Strong'. Some participants preferred 'Medium'-strength passwords of 8-12 characters due to the need to type them frequently.

Several participants noted that they reset their passwords to shorter, more manageable ones, despite initially creating longer passwords. This aligns with findings in Figure 4 and Section 4.2, and with Mazurek et al.'s observations [32].

#### 5. Discussion
The policy change had hidden costs, including the time taken for users to adapt and the voluntary creation of weaker passwords. Over 27% of users had to reset their passwords more than once per year, often with shorter expiration times. System usability may hinder policy adoption for some users.

Adams & Sasse [1] note that most users want to behave securely, but insecure behavior arises from managing excessive workplace demands. The similar patterns of change across departments suggest a collective shift in password use, possibly influenced by a shared security culture.

From a security perspective, the weakest possible password can withstand online attacks (10^6 guesses), but the increase in strength is not sufficient to protect against offline attacks [23]. The intervention revealed each user's threshold for trading off password complexity for lifetime, influenced by individual time management, effort acceptance, and perceived account value.

The policy increased costs through individual effort and organizational support, but users welcomed the possibility of longer lifetimes. Hidden costs include interruptions from password expirations, reminder emails, and planning for future changes. Brostoff [10] identified additional costs related to expired passwords, such as designing new passwords and amending recall aids.

#### 6. Limitations
Our study lacked a control group, making it difficult to determine if users would choose stronger passwords without the lifetime incentive. Existing literature [49, 50] suggests that users tend to choose similar passwords rather than continuously improving their strength. New users behaved similarly to the existing population, suggesting that the effects are due to the new policy rather than the system change.

#### 7. Conclusion
We evaluated the impact of a new password policy on 100,000 university users. The policy allowed users to choose passwords with lifetimes ranging from 100 days (50 bits of entropy) to 350 days (120 bits of entropy). Users adapted their passwords to receive longer lifetimes, but the intervention took over 100 days to gain traction, and users took over 12 months to increase their average password lifetime from 146 days (63 bits) to 170 days (70 bits). The policy had both apparent and potential costs, with 66% of users resetting their passwords multiple times. The analysis revealed different levels of engagement with the policy, and early indicators of high reset rates and varied adoption could have been addressed with better monitoring.
