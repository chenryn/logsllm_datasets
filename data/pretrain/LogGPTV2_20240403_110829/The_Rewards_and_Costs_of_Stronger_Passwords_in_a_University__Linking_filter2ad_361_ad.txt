mated as fully eliciting 48.43 bits. Given that the weak-
est allowed password in our university has an entropy of
50 bits, we expect 2.59% of Engineering accounts and
2.92% of School of Education accounts to be compro-
mised after 3.8 × 1014 guesses.
If we increase the at-
tacker’s brute force capacity to 60 bits (1018 guesses), the
expected proportion of accounts which may be compro-
mised increases to 36% and 44% respectively.In either
case School of Education passwords are 1.13 and 1.22
times as likely as Engineering passwords to be guessed.
4.6 Password change time series by rela-
tionship
In addition to an analysis by school/faculty, we are also
able to differentiate between the different roles of indi-
viduals within the university. The evolution of the re-
spective user group’s password strength can be found in
Figure 10. Relationships with less than 5,000 / 2% of
the total password changes/resets have been omitted. As
for the previous graph, all user groups show an upward
trend in their password strength over time. There are also
signiﬁcant variations between the groups, with Teach-
ing/Research staff exhibiting password strengths 21 days
stronger than Postgraduate students.A linear regression
predicting the password strength depending on the rela-
tionship types was carried out. Each type of relationship
contributed statistically signiﬁcantly, explaining 89% of
variance (R2 = 0.893, F(13,12559) = 7957, p < 10−10).
The differences are in line with the hypotheses in Sec-
tion 3:
there appears to be both a positive correlation
between password strength and likely value attached to
the account (see Section 3.5), and a negative correlation
between password strength and frequency of use. For ex-
ample, Teaching/Research staff are likely to value their
account security highly (using their accounts to access
research and teaching data, which undergraduate stu-
dents for instance would not.We observe that this group
has the highest average password strength.
Administrative staff may value their account security
highly too, but they also have a high frequency of use of
the password, which may act to moderate their password
strength. An interesting group to investigate in further
research are the Alumni. These users are very different to
the rest of the population: their account usage is low, so
a long password expiration time will help minimise the
frequency of password changes/resets; being potentially
remote to the university, they may perceive the potential
cost of a forgotten password as being much higher.
The results presented in this section answer our initial
research questions: users have responded to the freedom
of choosing their password lifetime slowly, but have in
time increased their password lifetime considerably. The
user population has needed time to adapt to the change
in authentication protocols; 14 months after the interven-

tion, the password strength of all user groups has yet to
plateau. We have identiﬁed differences in how users re-
act to the policy change, by analysing the evolution of
password strength between different subgroups (role and
division). Other work has demonstrated that security pre-
paredness and perceptions can differ between roles and
divisions in a large organisation [5].
4.7 User feedback
Here we present a preliminary summary and discussion
of ﬁeld notes taken by interviewers (see Section 3.6).
Feedback from the 93 interview participants informs the
view of factors which may inﬂuence decisions around the
construction and use of passwords on the studied system.
We discuss general observations, with representative par-
ticipant quotes. Participant identiﬁers signify E## (Em-
ployee/Staff) or S## (Student).
A few participants reported changing their password-
related habits in response to the new system. This in-
cluded beginning to store the password in a password
manager, or as with E19, making a written note:
“Well, normally I just memorise it. This time
around I did actually write it down when I
changed it last week. Because it was so much
longer than normal. Because previously they
were eight characters. Now I think my pass-
word is like twelve characters. And it had to
be that long to get the security up too. Because
of now they rate it like low, medium, strong se-
curities. So I had to keep adding characters
to get it to say strong. So it is longer than I
normally have.”
Many participants appreciated the ﬂexibility of the
new password policy. Some had however used the new
system but not explored the differences between it and
the old system; the differences between systems – and
policies – were not immediately apparent to all partici-
pants. With the introduction of the new system, partic-
ipants were split as to whether they believed passwords
should be expired or remain valid indeﬁnitely.
There was a general even split among interview par-
ticipants as to whether they saw a link between password
age and password strength. The data supports this, as a
year after deployment users’ average password strength
has yet to settle (as notable in Figure 8). This could po-
tentially be as much about discovering the features of the
new system as it is about skillfully using it. For those
who were aware of it, some did see it as an incentive to
make a stronger password, such as E20:
“If they say if you make a stronger password
you can keep it for longer, maybe it would help.
[...] It wasn’t clear that it was contingent on
the strength of your password. I don’t know if
it is.”
Conversely, E25 found it difﬁcult to create a valid
password that was not labelled ‘Weak’:
“I probably tried about 6-7 passwords before
I got to the one that it would accept ... It [the
password meter] just kept not getting past the
failed point ...”

need to type the password many times, and as a result
would aim for a ‘Medium’-strength password of around
8-12 characters. E30:

trying to think of
a password. In a way it is not good that you
are supposed to change a password. You run
out of ideas of what to use. It’s good that they
are aware of your security but it does get a bit
stressful.”
A number of participants commented that although
they had created a longer password than before, they im-
mediately reset their password as they found it too com-
plicated to type, such as S17:
“even though I could remember it wasn’t prac-
tically very helpful if you have to put in you
know twenty characters.
It’s not great. So
then I changed it to something that was shorter
and last a little less time I just could remember
that.”
This aligns with our ﬁndings in Figure 4 and Sec-
tion 4.2, and also with Mazurek et al.’s engagement with
system users [32]:
those ﬁnding longer passwords un-
workable will act to ﬁnd a solution which is workable,
abandoning the potential for longer lifetimes.
The summatory ﬁndings indicate that there may be a
number of factors inﬂuencing password choice which are
not represented in the dataset. The analysis in Section 4
was based on the available data, and the available data
ﬁelds. Future collaboration will explore how the design
of password system logs can be augmented to provide a
more directly holistic view.
5 Discussion
There are hidden costs of the change in policy that should
be considered. The intervention took time to gain trac-
tion, and it may have been that this time could have been
shortened in some way. In some cases, users were vol-
untarily changing their passwords to a weaker combina-
tion of characters, taking time to learn how to skillfully
choose stronger passwords (i.e., sustain stronger pass-
words over successive change events). The analysis in-
forming Figure 4 uncovered that over 27% of users have
had to reset their passwords more than once per year, and
that these users have passwords with much shorter expi-
ration. It could be that system usability hinders the adop-
tion of the policy for a proportion of users.
As noted by Adams & Sasse, [1], most users in an
organisation will want to behave securely, where inse-
cure behaviour arises as they try to manage excessive de-
mands in their workplace (where security would be just
one of those demands). That the changes across differ-
ent departments and user groups follow relatively simi-
lar patterns suggests that there was a collective change in
password use, perhaps due to a collective culture towards
security or inﬂuence from how peers are seen to behave.
From a security perspective, the implications of our
results are clear. In the current format of the policy, the
weakest possible password is strong enough to withstand
an online attack (need to withstand 106 guesses); the in-
crease in strength has not been pronounced enough to
protect against ofﬂine attacks [23]. Rather than improv-
ing robustness to a wider range of attacks, the interven-
tion has identiﬁed each user’s individual threshold for
trading off password complexity for password lifetime.
It is a combination of the subjective cost optimisation of
the individual’s time (time spent both resetting and au-
thenticating), acceptance of the perceived effort in man-
aging a complex password, and their perceived value of
their account. As different individuals interact differently
with the university, this optimisation varies across user
groups, as in Figures 9 and 10.
From a cost-beneﬁt analysis, the policy has increased
cost through increased individual effort cost and organi-
sational support cost due to resets. The beneﬁts for users
rely on their perceptions: our user interviews found that
the possibility of longer lifetimes was welcomed, and
perceived this as an improvement considering their pre-
vious experiences of organisational password policies.
Here we have considered the different contexts in
which users interact with the password policy. A further
hidden cost arises from the interruption of the primary
task from expiration of passwords, the reminder emails,
and the planning of when to next change one’s password
(as one might be about to travel or go on leave, for in-
stance). In studying the use of passwords and support of
users in a large organisation, Brostoff [10] identiﬁed a
range of ‘costs’ related to the expiry of passwords, such
as designing new passwords, re-design of a candidate
password if the system does not permit it, and amending
any recall aids such as written notes. Brostoff’s results
also suggest that users may confuse prior and current
passwords, where having had expired passwords then
contributes to the daily cost of entering a current pass-
word correctly. The extra reward perceived for a stronger
password must be greater than the cumulative additional
time (i.e., perceived effort) required to correctly enter the
password when it is needed. This is to say nothing of the
frustration that may be caused in recalling and entering
passwords, and the batching of tasks that may occur to
reduce the regularity of password entry events [41]. A

users to complete diaries – or otherwise report on their
experience of using the system – may more clearly iden-
tify the workload caused by the authentication system.
policy on them [29]. We continue to work with the sys-
tem managers to analyse new log data, and to explore
how user needs and challenges can be anticipated.
5.1 Limitations
Our main limitation stems from studying passwords ‘in
the wild’: our study did not have a control group. This
means we are unable to observe if users would choose
stronger passwords without the presence of the greater
lifetime incentive. However, the existing literature [49,
50] suggests that users choose new passwords that are
similar to previous ones, rather than continuously act
themselves to improve the strength of their password.
We did not have log data for users prior to deploy-
ment of the new system. However, new users who were
unaware of the old system behaved similarly to the exist-
ing population, suggesting that effects are due to the new
policy rather than the change in systems.
6 Conclusion
Here we evaluated the impact of a new password pol-
icy upon 100,000 users at our university.
In what is a
novel policy designed by system managers, users were
able to choose passwords with lifetime varying from 100
(50 bits of entropy) to 350 days (120 bits of entropy).
While the security community is moving away from
prescribing password expiration, we have found that
users ‘play the game’ and adapt their passwords in order
to receive longer lifetimes. Results show that the inter-
vention took over 100 days to gain traction, and that users
took over 12 months to move from a lower-than-initial
average 146-day (63 bits) to a higher 170-day (70 bits)
password lifetime. The policy had both apparent and po-
tential costs for individual users: 66% of users had to
reset – as opposed to routinely change – their passwords,
often multiple times. The average user had 3.5 passwords
over the duration of the study. Users who are forced to
reset their password more than once a year compensate
by choosing signiﬁcantly weaker passwords. Depending
on the implementation of the reset procedure, both the
actual and user-perceived cost may be high.
The analysis has revealed different levels of engage-
ment with the policy. Had the system been monitored
more directly for the impact upon users, the high re-
set rate and varied degrees of adoption amongst differ-
ent user groups could have been seen as early indicators
