Currently, there are two formulations in the documentation: (1) in the
`Returns` description, some form of "N trials given n successes" where the
last trial is incorrectly indexed as N + n and (2) in the `Notes`, "N failures
given n successes and p(success) = p". ~~However, neither of these
descriptions match the variable that is actually returned, which via the
gamma-Poisson mixture is "N successes given n failures and p(success) = p".~~
While "N failures given n successes" and "N successes given n failures" have
the same expression as their respective pmfs, they are not equivalent except
when p=0.5:
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp
    import scipy.special
    N = np.arange(100)
    p = 0.5
    # N successes given 5 failures
    p0 = sp.special.binom(N + 5 - 1, N) * p**N *(1-p)**5
    # N failures given 5 succeses
    p1 = sp.special.binom(5 + N - 1, 4)  * p**5 *(1-p)**N
    np.allclose(p0 ,p1)
    # True
    p = 0.75
    p0 = sp.special.binom(N + 5 - 1, N) * p**N *(1-p)**5
    p1 = sp.special.binom(5 + N - 1, 4)  * p**5 *(1-p)**N
    np.allclose(p0, p1)
    # False
Clearly "N failures given n successes and p(success) = p" is equivalent to "N
successes given n failures and p(success) = 1 - p". ~~The quickest solution is
to change the description to match "N successes given n failures and
p(success) = p".~~ I also suggest switching to the p(k; r, p) notation used on
the negative binomial distribution Wikipedia page.
EDIT: On further inspection, the output does match the second description,
given the shape and scale parameterization of the gamma distribution. I've
changed the title to reflect this.
