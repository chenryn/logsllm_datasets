traﬃc to regional Zoom servers in Canada has inadvertently constrained the
supply of MMR servers available. As a result, these servers often host multiple
Zoom meetings at the same time, some of which are large and long duration
meetings. At busy times of the day, some MMR servers seem to become sluggish
(e.g., TLS), compromising session quality and the user-level Zoom experience.
For campus network administrators, our main recommendation is to ensure
that a suﬃciently large pool of regional servers is available. If this is not possible,
then a second option is to reduce the default video bit rate on Zoom sessions, so
that traﬃc loads are lower. A third option is to host a Zoom Meeting Zone within
the campus network, though this might be expensive, and would no longer be
needed when the pandemic is over. Finally, it is important to consider the load
that Zoom places on the campus WiFi network and the NAT infrastructure, to
ensure that these are not performance bottlenecks for Zoom.
For Zoom network engineers, one recommendation is to ensure that their
regional data centers are adequately resourced to handle peak traﬃc loads.
Better monitoring of these facilities could also identify performance anomalies
sooner. Another recommendation is to improve Zoom’s load balancing, which
currently seems to be random, rather than load-based. These policies lead to
non-uniform loads on MMR servers (Fig. 5(b)), and poor selections of failover
servers when needed (Fig. 8). A third recommendation is to consider the use of
QUIC, rather than UDP, for media streaming, if they are not already doing so.
QUIC could provide a simpler solution for robust media streaming, without the
need for elaborate FEC and failover strategies. In the longer term, a ﬁnal recom-
mendation is to consider the use of network-layer or application-layer multicast,
which seems like a potential solution to reduce network traﬃc and server load.

6.2 Limitations
There are several limitations to our study. First, our monitoring infrastructure
only sees traﬃc that traverses the edge of the campus network, so we inherently
underestimate Zoom traﬃc when some meeting participants are oﬀ-campus. Sec-
ond, our heuristics for UDP channel classiﬁcation (i.e., audio, video, data) are
simple threshold-based policies, and may not be robust to the many variations
possible in empirical Zoom traﬃc. Third, a similar caveat applies to our heuristics
for Zoom meeting classiﬁcation: overlapping meetings on the same Zoom server
make meeting identiﬁcation quite a challenge, and campus-level NAT means that
the same client IP can be in multiple Zoom meetings (same or diﬀerent) at the
same time. Fourth, the restarts of our monitor, plus any packet losses there,
result in underestimation of Zoom traﬃc volume. Finally, our traﬃc analysis
approach currently misses Zoom traﬃc exchanged in P2P mode, since neither
endpoint is a Zoom address. Identifying this traﬃc (at least when it crosses the
campus edge network) is part of our ongoing work.
7 Conclusion
This paper has presented a detailed analysis of Zoom network traﬃc on a univer-
sity campus network. Through small-scale experiments, we identiﬁed the struc-
tural properties of Zoom sessions. We then used the knowledge and insights from
the small-scale study to analyze large-scale Zoom traﬃc at the campus level.
The main take-home messages from our paper are as follows. First, Zoom
usage on our campus has increased 4x with the transition to a mix of in-
person and online course delivery. Second, this traﬃc can stress campus network
infrastructure, including WiFi and NAT, due to many concurrent meetings,
temporally-correlated arrivals, high video bit rates, and long-lasting sessions.
Third, many Zoom sessions experience disruptions, seemingly triggered by high
demand on a limited supply of regional Zoom servers. These disruptions can
degrade the QoE for Zoom users. Finally, our simple analysis and visualization
tools provide an eﬀective way to identify and quantify such problems.
Our ongoing work seeks to corroborate the results from our network-level
view with the application-level view provided by the Zoom console (dashboard)
used by our campus network administrators.

Appendix A: Data Format and Analysis Tools
Figure 8 shows an example of the connection log data from the Zoom test session
in Fig. 1. This format uses selected columns from the Zeek connection log [13].
Each line summarizes the network traﬃc on one connection (TCP, UDP, or
ICMP). In this example, A.B.C.D is a laptop on the campus WiFi network,
K.L.M.N is a laptop on a home network, and W.X.Y.Z is a Zoom MMR server.
The number of users varied between 1 and 3, but the third user was oﬀ campus,
and thus does not appear in the log. In this example, there were two UDP
connection attempts before P2P mode was fully established. Also, an ICMP
“port unreachable” message was sent when switching back to server mode.

Fig. 8. Zeek connection log entries for Zoom test session (anonymized)
We have written C and Python programs to parse such log entries and pro-
duce graphical visualizations of Zoom sessions using gnuplot. Our C programs
(called zoomparse.c, zoomplot.c, and zoomcount.c) produce a textual sum-
mary, intermediate data for graph plotting, and a statistical summary of Zoom
sessions, respectively. We also have a Python program that parses full Zeek
connection log entries, and produces a summary of Zoom sessions and Zoom
meetings. The latter program relies on a database of Zoom server IP addresses
and server types. Our software tools and graph plotting scripts are available
from http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/∼carey/software.htm.
Appendix B: Additional Zoom Test Sessions
We collected Wireshark traces of several other Zoom sessions in order to identify
typical and atypical behaviours. Figure 9 shows two unusual examples.
Figure 9(a) shows the packet traﬃc for a small meeting with three par-
ticipants (all on their home networks), during which the presenter used the
screen-sharing function to scroll through a large PDF document. In this exam-
ple, the screen-sharing data volume (green) ﬂuctuated dramatically, and actually
exceeded the video traﬃc volume for most of the session.
Figure 9(b) shows the video and audio packet traﬃc for an on-campus par-
ticipant during a seven-person Zoom meeting. (We exclude the data and control

(b) Extreme Spikes in Zoom Traﬃc
Fig. 9. Additional examples of Zoom test sessions in Wireshark
traﬃc from the graph, since it is negligible.) There are extreme spikes in the
traﬃc during this Zoom session, which had very poor QoE (the diﬀerent colors
in the graph show the audio and video disruptions). One of the spikes, near
the 20-min mark, reﬂects Zoom’s bandwidth probing, which lasts for 10 s. The
other spikes, however, are more extreme, and seem almost periodic. Each spike
in the Wireshark trace lasts for only a second or two, and is preceded by a 2–3
s interval with no packets at all. Furthermore, the same pattern occurs in both
the audio and video traﬃc (as well as non-Zoom traﬃc in the trace).
We do not believe that the traﬃc spikes in Fig. 9(b) are attributable to Zoom
servers. Rather, this phenomenon could reﬂect congestion on the campus WiFi
network (e.g., a large backlog at an AP), or could be a measurement artifact from
running Wireshark on the same laptop as the Zoom session. We have observed
this pattern in at least three diﬀerent Wireshark traces, but have not yet been
able to recreate it experimentally.
These examples help illustrate the variety of traﬃc patterns observed during
our Zoom test sessions.
