Abstract—Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest mobile
communication standard and has a pivotal role in our infor-
mation society: LTE combines performance goals with modern
security mechanisms and serves casual use cases as well as critical
infrastructure and public safety communications. Both scenarios
are demanding towards a resilient and secure speciﬁcation and
implementation of LTE, as outages and open attack vectors
potentially lead to severe risks. Previous work on LTE protocol
security identiﬁed crucial attack vectors for both the physical
(layer one) and network (layer three) layers. Data link layer
(layer two) protocols, however, remain a blind spot in existing
LTE security research.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive layer two security
analysis and identify three attack vectors. These attacks impair
the conﬁdentiality and/or privacy of LTE communication. More
speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst present a passive identity mapping attack
that matches volatile radio identities to longer lasting network
identities, enabling us to identify users within a cell and serving
as a stepping stone for follow-up attacks. Second, we demonstrate
how a passive attacker can abuse the resource allocation as
a side channel to perform website ﬁngerprinting that enables
the attacker to learn the websites a user accessed. Finally, we
present the ALTER attack that exploits the fact that LTE user
data is encrypted in counter mode (AES-CTR) but not integrity
protected, which allows us to modify the message payload.
As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we show how an active
attacker can redirect DNS requests and then perform a DNS
spooﬁng attack. As a result, the user is redirected to a malicious
website. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the real-world
applicability of all three attacks and emphasizes the threat of
open attack vectors on LTE layer two protocols.
I. INTRODUCTION
The latest mobile communication standard LTE represents
the daily communication infrastructure for billions of people
in the world and has a pivotal role in our information society.
LTE is designed to combine performance goals such as high
transmission rates and low latency with a series of security
features like formally proven mutual authentication, well-
established encryption algorithms such as AES, and separated
security domains. Besides casual use cases, LTE also has
an emerging relevance for critical infrastructures and public
safety communications [1]. Both scenarios are demanding
towards a resilient and secure speciﬁcation and implementation
of LTE, as outages and open attack vectors potentially lead to
severe risks. While the LTE speciﬁcation considers a diverse
set of security features, it can hardly predict all potential
attacks, and it is even harder to cover sets of restrictions in
real-world implementations.
Consequently, recent academic and non-academic work
identiﬁed various potential vulnerabilities on different layers
of the LTE protocol stack. On the network layer (layer three),
passive or active attackers can either localize a user or deny
the service and thus downgrade the phone to the insecure GSM
network [2]–[4]. On the physical layer (layer one), LTE can be
the target of jamming attacks that aim to deny the service [5]–
[8]. As a matter of fact, the previous research efforts focused
only on layer one or layer three protocols and—to the best
of our knowledge—no security analysis of data link layer
(layer two) protocols exists to date. This leads to a situation
of uncertainty about potential security and privacy threats
that arise from the speciﬁcation or implementation ﬂaws of
the data link layer and its three protocols: Medium Access
Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), and Packet Data
Convergence Protocol (PDCP).
In this paper, we perform a security analysis of LTE on
layer two and analyze these protocols for potential vulner-
abilities. As a result, we introduce two passive attacks and
one active attack that impair the conﬁdentiality and privacy
of LTE communication. Table I shows an overview of the
attacks and their properties. We ﬁrst focus on a passive
adversary who can remain stealthy during an attack, i. e., being
successful does not depend on any active interference with
the network entities or protocols. Our ﬁrst passive attack,
the identity mapping attack, allows an adversary to map the
user’s temporary network identity (TMSI) to the temporary
radio identity (RNTI). More speciﬁcally, we demonstrate how
an attacker can precisely localize and identify a user within
the cell, distinguish multiple transmission streams, and use
this information as a stepping stone for subsequent attacks.
One example for this is our second attack vector, the website
ﬁngerprinting attack. Website ﬁngerprinting is known from
other contexts like Tor [9], where trafﬁc analysis reveals the
browsing behavior of users despite Tor’s onion encryption. In
the context of LTE, we demonstrate a comparable information
leak in the resource allocation: even though transmissions are
encrypted, we can access plaintext information up to the PDCP
and learn the transmission characteristics for individual users.
This information is sufﬁcient to distinguish accessed websites
and de-anonymize a connection that is perceived to be secure
due to encryption. Both attacks already harm user privacy
separately, but they can be combined to an even stronger
version of website ﬁngerprinting, while solely depending on
passive (downlink) snifﬁng.
We further introduce an active attack called ALTER that
exploits the missing integrity protection of LTE user data to
perform a chosen-ciphertext attack. Our attack is based on the

insight that user data is encrypted in counter mode (AES-CTR)
but not integrity protected, hence the cipher is malleable. We
show how an adversary can actively manipulate the encrypted
payload and control speciﬁc parts of the message. More
speciﬁcally, we demonstrate how an attacker uses a malicious
LTE relay to manipulate the IP addresses within an encrypted
packet, thereby redirecting a packet to a malicious DNS server
in the uplink direction, while maintaining a stable and transpar-
ent connection at all times. Even though ALTER solely focuses
on layer two, the attack still has cross-layer consequences and
impacts overlying protocols like IP and DNS. ALTER affects
all LTE devices and has implications up to the application
layer. At the same time, the attack is hard to detect by existing
countermeasures like rogue base station detection [10], [11]
and makes a change in the LTE speciﬁcation the only viable
prevention from user data manipulation.
We have veriﬁed all attack vectors within a real-world,
commercial network using a Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR)
and an open-source LTE stack implementation. Our experi-
ments show that our attacks are feasible in practice and pose
a realistic threat to users. In particular, we show that the
identity mapping attack can be performed in a commercial
network on an estimate of 94.73 % of connections. Our website
ﬁngerprinting attack achieves an average detection rate of
approximately 90 % for the Alexa top 50 in a closed-world
scenario, tested with three different devices. Combining both
attacks creates a powerful non-invasive attacker that is barely
detectable. Finally, we have built a proof-of-concept malicious
relay and performed the ALTER attack against a Commercial
Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mobile phone in a commercial network.
We were able to successfully redirect a mobile phone to visit a
malicious website while maintaining a stable LTE connection.
In summary, we provide the following three contributions:
• We perform an extensive LTE layer two analysis. In
particular, we examine the control plane for possible
information leaks that allow an attacker to gain access
to sensitive information. Furthermore, we investigate the
effects of missing integrity protection on the user plane.
• Based upon the performed analysis, we present three
attacks: Two passive attacks allow identity mapping and
website ﬁngerprinting purely based on metadata. The
active attack allows to redirect DNS trafﬁc and, thus,
perform a DNS spooﬁng attack.
• We demonstrate the feasibility of all three attacks with
realistic setups. For each attack, we discuss the real-
world applicability, especially with a focus on attacker
capabilities and the impact for the user. Furthermore, we
discuss possible countermeasures to mitigate the threats.
By sharing our results, we hope to inﬂuence the upcoming
5G speciﬁcation to include countermeasures.
Responsible Disclosure. The lack of integrity protection was
an active decision of the LTE speciﬁcation body, mainly
related to the additional overhead induced on the radio
layer [12]. We demonstrate that this missing integrity protec-
tion can be exploited in practice. We are in contact with the
GSM Association (GSMA) and 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) security groups, following the guidelines of
responsible disclosure. We hope to inﬂuence the upcoming 5G
speciﬁcations to add mitigations for the demonstrated attacks
and will actively work with GSMA and 3GPP to resolve these
attack vectors.
II. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
The different components of the LTE network infrastructure
they connect a
are deﬁned by the roles they fulﬁll, e. g.,
user to the network, manage the resource allocation, or build
the backbone of the network. The capabilities of all these
components are deﬁned following the rule set of the LTE
protocol stack and its respective layers. Within this paper, we
focus on the data link layer of the air interface between the
user and the network. In the following, we provide an overview
of the network and the LTE stack, along with an introduction
of relevant authentication and encryption algorithms. Further-
more, we introduce the two adversary models that we consider
in our attacks.
A. LTE Network Overview
The LTE network infrastructure consists of end devices for
users (User Equipment (UE)), base stations as intermediate
connectors called Evolved NodeB (eNodeB), and the core
network for mobility management with the aim to provide
permanent Internet access. We conduct our attacks between
the victim user and a benign base station.
identity,
1) UE: The user equipment
is the end device provid-
ing services to the user. It has a permanent
the
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), and different
temporary identities within the network. One of these tem-
porary identiﬁers is the Radio Network Temporary Identity
(RNTI), which helps to distinguish multiple connections on
the radio layer. Besides the connection establishment, the UE
also applies encryption/decryption and integrity protection for
transmissions through the network.
2) eNodeB: The eNodeBs are the base stations of the LTE
network and responsible for radio resource management and
user data encryption. Furthermore, an eNodeB sends paging
messages on a broadcast channel. For our attacks, we exploit

the fact that UEs select the eNodeB with the highest signal
strength allowing us to establish an active malicious relay.
3) Evolved Packet Core (EPC): The EPC is the core of
the network and is responsible for authentication, mobility
management, and forwarding of user data. It
triggers the
procedure for sending out paging requests when user data is
incoming.
B. LTE Protocol Stack
The LTE protocol stack between the UE and the eNodeB
is depicted in Figure 1. We brieﬂy explain each layer and its
tasks from bottom to top. Later on, we describe the individual
security mechanisms within the protocol stack separately, since
some work in a cross-layer fashion.
1) Physical Layer: As the lowest layer in the protocol
stack, the physical layer is responsible for transmitting infor-
mation over the air interface. The physical layer searches for
cell candidates and synchronizes with a selected cell. Further,
it controls the transmission power for the physical channel and
adapts encoding and modulation schemes. The values for these
parameters are adjusted by a channel quality indicator that is
regularly sent by the UE’s MAC protocol.
2) Data Link Layer: The data link layer extends the phys-
ical layer bit pipe by additional services towards the upper
layers and provides mechanisms for reliability, security, and
integrity. It is organized in three sublayers: (i) MAC protocol
scheduling the medium access, (ii) RLC protocol managing the
segmentation or concatenation of data units, and (iii) PDCP
protocol performing ciphering tasks and optional IP header
compression.
Medium Access Control (MAC). The MAC protocol man-
ages the access to the radio resources of LTE. To do so, each
UE with an active radio connection must be distinguishable
by a unique identity, the RNTI. To obtain such an RNTI,
the UE performs the Random Access Preamble (RAP) with
the eNodeB of its current cell and exchanges an unencrypted
Random Access Response (RAR). In this process, the MAC
layer of the eNodeB determines the available radio resources
for the UE, matches these assigned resources to the RNTI,
and ﬁnally signals this information to the UE to be used for
the following transmissions. We use the unique information of
the RNTI to perform our identity mapping attack.
When data needs to be sent in uplink direction, the UE
layer issues a scheduling request at a conﬁgured location. The
eNodeB utilizes the Downlink Control Information (DCI) for
notifying the UE when and where the resources are available
in uplink and downlink direction. As we will see later, the
DCI information leaks sensitive information that enables us to
perform a website ﬁngerprinting attack.
Radio Link Control (RLC). The RLC protocol offers three
transmission modes: (i) Acknowledged Mode (AM), (ii) Un-
acknowledged Mode (UM), and (iii) Transparent Mode (TM).
Depending on the mode,
the RLC protocol applies error
correction, segmentation, and assembles data into the correct
order of upper-layer packets. Furthermore, it manages retrans-
missions including the detection of retransmitted packets.
Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP). The PDCP
protocol provides encryption and integrity protection for con-
trol plane messages to the overlying Radio Resource Control
(RRC) layer and transfers encrypted user plane data to upper-
level protocols like IP. Within the data link layer, the PDCP
