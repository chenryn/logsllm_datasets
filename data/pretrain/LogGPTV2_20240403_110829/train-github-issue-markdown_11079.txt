##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
win_reboot
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.0.0
##### CONFIGURATION
retry_files_enabled = False
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
The win_reboot action incorrectly assumes that the WinRM connection transport
is being utilized to speak to the machine, however if someone is running a
custom ansible transport, win_reboot assumes that the transport has properties
such as `_winrm_host`, `_winrm_port`, and `_reset()`.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Use a custom transport to talk to a Windows machine and use the win_reboot
function (sadly, our transport is not open sourced yet. Coming soon!).
ansible/lib/ansible/plugins/action/win_reboot.py
Lines 79 to 80 in 6787fc7
|  winrm_host = self._connection._winrm_host  
---|---  
|  winrm_port = self._connection._winrm_port  
ansible/lib/ansible/plugins/action/win_reboot.py
Line 115 in 6787fc7
|  self._connection._reset()  
---|---  
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I would hope we can make it so that an action doesn't implicitly depend on
WinRM being the transport.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
It does implicitly depend on WinRM being the transport. :-)
