As a rule of thumb, naming conventions should always include some kind of a
package/namespace/prefix/suffix to indicate which plugin objects belong to.
In this case, there was none of that and ".modal" was used which is now
causing a conflict when you use any other plugins with the same name which, in
this case, happens to occur quite often.
