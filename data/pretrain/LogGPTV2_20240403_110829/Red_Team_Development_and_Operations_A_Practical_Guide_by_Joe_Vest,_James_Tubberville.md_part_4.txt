### Continuous Operations in Red Team Engagements

Continuous operations in Red Team engagements are designed to expose the desired vulnerabilities, provide learning opportunities for defenders, offer metrics and measurements to management, and maintain access for future operations. However, these operations require significant time, effort, and financial resources, making them most suitable for mature organizations or those facing serious threats.

### Engagement Notifications

When planning a Red Team engagement, a critical decision is who should be informed. The options range from notifying only a few trusted individuals to informing the entire organization. The choice depends on the engagement's goals and type. For Red-on-Blue exercises, it is straightforward: everyone knows. For live, active targets, the decision can significantly impact the results and must be made carefully.

#### Announced Red Team Engagement

In an announced engagement, the organization (or at least the security operations team) is aware that an engagement is underway. This can have several impacts:

- **Increased Security Measures:** The organization may enhance security by patching systems, changing passwords, and preparing for a known attack, which can affect the engagement's results.
- **Comprehensive Planning:** Key members of the organization can be involved, ensuring that critical assets are included and Red Team goals are set appropriately.
- **Effective Communication:** Fears of a rogue Red Team can be addressed early, leading to a more in-depth engagement with well-planned rules of engagement.

#### Unannounced Red Team Engagement

In an unannounced engagement, the organization (especially the security operations team) is unaware of the ongoing engagement. This can have the following impacts:

- **Realistic Results:** The organization will respond as it would on any given day, providing a realistic measure of the actual security posture.
- **Potential Overreaction:** Fear of the unknown may cause some organizations to overreact, potentially leading to self-inflicted damages if policies and procedures are not followed.
- **Oversights in Planning:** Critical assets may be missed if only a small number of the organization's team is involved in planning, leading to a loss of focus on high-risk areas.

### How to Decide?

1. **Measuring Security Operations Effectiveness:** If the goal is to measure the overall effectiveness of the organization’s security operations, start with an unannounced engagement. Despite limitations, the results will be the most accurate and realistic.
2. **Specific Capability Testing:** If the goal is to measure the effectiveness of a specific capability, tool, process, or technology, start with an announced engagement. Including the defenders ensures the scope and rules are adequately designed to achieve the desired results.

### Roles and Responsibilities

An effective Red Team comprises a diverse group of individuals with core operator traits. Successful execution requires the involvement of various roles and groups.

#### White Cell

The White Cell enforces the Rules of Engagement to ensure neither Red Team nor defender activities cause unexpected problems. Their responsibilities include:

- **Refereeing:** Serving as a referee between Red Team activities and defender responses.
- **Metrics Establishment:** Establishing metrics for the engagement.
- **Coordination:** Coordinating activities on both sides to achieve engagement goals.
- **Information Provision:** Providing necessary information for an efficient engagement.
- **Deconfliction:** Assisting with deconfliction activities.
- **Scoring:** Scoring the engagement (if applicable).
- **Lessons Learned:** Compiling a list of lessons learned through observation.

The White Cell is an observer and data correlator, not part of the target environment or engagement team. They should receive information from the defender but never deliver information to the defender.

#### Engagement Control Group (ECG)

The ECG is responsible for all activities during the engagement, including:

- **Approval:** Approving the engagement schedule, objectives, and directives.
- **Target Selection:** Approving Red Team objective targets.
- **Blacklist Management:** Establishing a time-coordinated blacklist for the environment.
- **Environment Information:** Providing information needed to construct scenarios.
- **Management and Direction:** Providing management and direction for the engagement.
- **Information Dissemination:** Determining what information should be provided to the defender.
- **Operational Impact:** Deciding when actions should be implemented.

The ECG typically includes senior managers, IT department members, a White Cell liaison, and a Red Team liaison. All must be Trusted Agents.

#### Trusted Agent (TA)

A Trusted Agent is a member of the target organization who knows an engagement is underway. Their primary role is to limit irreversible damage and risk. TAs have detailed knowledge of engagement activities and must protect this information from unauthorized disclosure. Each TA must sign a Trusted Agent Agreement before receiving any information.

#### Observers

Observers document the actions and reactions of each cell during the execution phase. They do not have prior knowledge of the engagement or scenario and do not provide information or guidance. Observers may report potentially damaging actions to the White Cell.

#### Red Cell

The Red Cell, also known as the Red Team, is the offensive component of the engagement. It typically includes Red Team leads and operators.

##### Red Team Lead

The Red Team Lead provides overall direction and guidance, oversees operational planning, and coordinates with other roles. Their responsibilities include:

- **Direction and Guidance:** Providing overall direction and guidance.
- **Information and Research:** Providing information and research data.
- **Operational Oversight:** Overseeing operational planning and execution.
- **Coordination:** Coordinating with other roles within the engagement.
- **Budget and Logistics:** Managing the budget, personnel, and equipment.
- **Engagement Execution:** Overseeing coordination with stakeholders, training activities, and logistics.
- **Final Report:** Ensuring the accurate and timely completion of the final engagement report.

##### Red Team Operator

Red Team operators execute the actions required to meet the engagement goals. Their responsibilities include:

- **Execution:** Executing engagement requirements.
- **Compliance:** Complying with laws, regulations, and Rules of Engagement.
- **Methodology Implementation:** Implementing the team’s operational methodology and TTPs.
- **Deficiency Identification:** Identifying and inputting target environment deficiencies.
- **Research and Development:** Researching and developing new exploits and testing tools.
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Performing Open Source Intelligence.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying and assessing system vulnerabilities.
- **Report Development:** Assisting in the development of the final engagement report.
- **Physical Assessment:** Providing physical assessment support.
- **Operational Impacts:** Executing approved operational impacts.

#### Blue Cell

The Blue Cell consists of the components defending the target network, including blue team members, defenders, internal staff, and organizational management.

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)

The ROE establishes the responsibility, relationship, and guidelines between the Red Team, network owner, system owner, and stakeholders. The ROE document includes:

- **Target Information:** Details about the target.
- **Approvals:** Necessary approvals.
- **Threat Implementation:** Types of threat implementation.
- **Activities and Issues:** Required activities and issues.
- **Legal Requirements:** References to legal requirements.
- **Disclaimer:** Legal responsibility disclaimer.
- **Engagement Objectives:** Specific objectives and conditions.
- **Authorized Target Space:** Network and physical boundaries.
- **Authorized and Restricted Actions:** Approved and restricted activities.
- **Approval Process:** Process for requesting additional activities.

The ROE must be updated when the target space, authorized actions, objectives, or scope change. The Red Team Lead addresses suggestions or adjustments, and the final ROE must be signed by a Trusted Agent in senior management.

### Managing Risk

Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising from Red Team activities. The goal is to minimize unnecessary risk while achieving the engagement's objectives. The ECG and Red Team Lead are responsible for implementing and accepting risk guidelines.

#### Practical Execution

Every engagement must include risk management in planning and execution. The risk management process includes:

1. **Identify Potential Issues:** Identify potential conflicts or hazards.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine the direct impact on the target environment.
3. **Develop Controls:** Develop controls to mitigate identified risks.

Risk management does not eliminate all risks but helps in making informed decisions and providing alternatives when risks are too high. It does not limit the Red Team's ability to operate, mandate decisions, or violate the law.
