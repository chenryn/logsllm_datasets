needed only to expose what they want. They can provide the defenders an opportunity to learn,
provide metrics and measurements to management, and maintain access to conduct future operations.
Continuous operations come at the cost of time, effort, and money and take more resources than any
other testing type. Mature organizations or organizations with serious threats are the best candidates
for continuous operations.
Engagement Notifications
When planning a Red Team engagement, a decision about whom to inform must be made. Will only a
few trusted individuals know their network is under attack? Or, will the organization as a whole be
aware? Neither option is better over the other. The decision of notification based on engagement
goals or the engagement type. In the case of Red-on-Blue exercises, the decision is easy. Everyone
knows. A choice must be made when performing a Red Team engagement against a live, active target.
This decision can have a considerable impact on the results and must be made carefully.
Announced Red Team Engagement
The organization (or at least the security operations team) has the knowledge that an engagement is
underway.
This can impact an engagement in the following ways.
An organization may increase security, patch systems, change passwords, or otherwise
prepare for a known attack. This can have a dramatic impact on the results.
Planning can include all key members of an organization. This helps ensure the critical
assets are included, and the Red Team goals can be set accordingly.
Fears of a rogue Red Team can be dealt with early through effective communication.
This typically leads to a more in-depth engagement where risks can be explored with
well-planned rules of engagement.
Unannounced Red Team Engagement
The organization (especially the security operations team) does not know that an engagement is
underway.
This can impact an engagement in the following ways.
An organization will act and respond as it would on any given day. This provides very
realistic results by measuring the actual posture of security operations.
Fear of the unknown causes some organizations to react with the “sky is falling”
mentality. This fear may cause unintended self-inflicted damages if policies and
procedures are not followed.
Goals and targets may not be included in the planning. When only a small number of an
organization's team is part of planning, critical assets may be missed and not included in
the scope. This oversight can cause an engagement to lose focus on areas that may
expose an organization to considerable risk.
How To Decide?
The following two tips can be used to answer the question about choosing announced or unannounced.
1. If the overall goal is to measure the effectiveness of an organization’s security
operations, start the planning with an unannounced engagement. Even with the
limitations, the results will be the most accurate and realistic in terms of understanding
a threat’s impact
2. If the overall goal is to measure the effectiveness of a specific capability, tool, process,
or technology, start the planning with an announced engagement. When goals are
specific or targeted, including the defenders can ensure the scope and rules are
adequately designed to achieve the desired results.
Red Team Tip
Announced vs. Unannounced Notification
1) If the overall goal is to measure the effectiveness of an
organization’s security operations, start the planning with
an unannounced engagement. Even with the limitations, the
results will be the most accurate and realistic in terms of
understanding a threat’s impact
2) If the overall goal is to measure the effectiveness of a
specific capability, tool, process, or technology, start the
planning with an announced engagement. When goals are
specific or targeted, including the defenders can ensure the
scope and rules are adequately designed to achieve the
desired results.
Roles and Responsibilities
An effective Red Team is comprised of a team of individuals who can contribute to the overall
success. Diversity is crucial, but the team as a whole must be comprised of the core operator traits. A
team can be even more successful when multiple team members contribute in various areas. In
addition to the Red Team itself, successful execution of an engagement requires the involvement of
numerous roles and groups.
White Cell
(Typically used during “game style” execution)
The White Cell primarily enforces the Rules of engagement to ensure neither Red Team nor defender
activities cause unexpected problems in the operational or target environment. The White Cell is
often tasked with:
Serving as referee between Red Team activities and defender responses during an engagement
Establishing metrics for the engagement
Coordinating activities on both sides to ensure engagement goals are achieved
Providing the information required to conduct an efficient engagement
Assisting with deconfliction activities between the Red Team and the defenders
Scoring the engagement (if applicable)
Providing a consolidated list of lessons learned obtained through observation during and
after—action request immediately following the engagement
The White Cell is also responsible for correlating activities conducted by the Red Team with actions
performed by the defenders (including times, systems, networks, team communications, etc.). This
data is beneficial to the defenders as well as to the control group in identifying shortfalls in the
security of the environment and defensive actions.
It is important to note that the White Cell is an observer and data correlator role, and not part of the
target environment or engagement team. The White Cell should receive information from the defender
but never deliver information to the defender. Any information provided to the defender must be
routed through the Engagement or Exercise Control Group.
Engagement Control Group (ECG)
The Engagement (or Exercise) Control Group is ultimately responsible for all activities conducted
during the engagement. This responsibility includes:
Approving the engagement schedule, objectives, and directives
Approving the Red Team objective targets for inclusion in engagement planning
Establishing a time-coordinated blacklist for the environment (if required)
Providing the environment information needed to construct scenarios that meet all
objectives for the engagement
Providing management and direction for the execution of the engagement
Determining if, when, and what information should be provided to the defender during
execution (a.k.a. injects)
Determining when actions should be implemented as part of an engagement operational
impact
Most often, the ECG is composed of one or two senior managers from the target environment (for
example, a Chief Information Officer or Chief Operating Officer), one member from the Information
Technology department of the organization, a White Cell liaison, and a Red Team liaison. Others can
be added as required. All must be Trusted Agents. Some communities consolidate the ECG and White
Cell into a single group with varying individual roles. When this occurs, an Engagement Control
Director must be selected to interface with the Red Team and control the flow of information to the
defenders.
Trusted Agent (TA)
A trusted agent is a member of the target organization who knows an engagement is underway. The
Trusted Agent’s primary role is to limit irreversible damage and risk to life, limb, eyesight, and
equipment; however, they are more often used to prevent the defenders from causing unexpected self-
inflicted damage. A TA has privileged and detailed knowledge of engagement activities, milestones,
conditions, and the engagement status that would unduly bias or influence the actions of the
environment staff and defenders. A Trusted Agent must protect all information from being provided to
any party without the express approval of the ECG. Each engagement should establish a Trusted
Agent Agreement that specifies to whom data can be delivered and under what approval process.
Each TA must execute the agreement before receiving any information about the engagement.
Observers
If observers are required, their role is to document the actions and reactions of each cell during the
execution phase of the engagement. They do not have knowledge of the engagement or scenario and do
not provide information, suggestions, assistance, guidance, etc. for any cell; however, the observer
may report potentially damaging actions to the white cell to ensure they are addressed.
Red Cell
The term red cell is borrowed from the military. It is commonly associated with a group that plays
OPFOR (opposing force) during red vs. blue exercises. A red cell is the components that make up the
offensive portion of a Red Team engagement. The red cell is typically comprised of Red Team leads
and operators and is commonly referred to as Red Team instead of Red Cell.
Red Team Lead
A Red Team should have a lead for each engagement. The lead may perform the role of the action
officer, the engagement lead, an operator, the customer interface, and, often, an analyst. In general, the
Red Team lead:
Provides overall direction and guidance for the team
Provides information and research data for all laws, regulations, policies, programs,
and operations
Provides oversight for operational planning and execution
Coordinates with each of the roles within the Red Team engagement
Plans and manages the budget, personnel, and equipment
Provides oversight for the team calendar
Provides information related to engagements, capabilities, technology, and trends
Provisions training and personnel development requirements
Performs a budget analysis, including equipment and travel
Identifies technical research and development directions
When planning or executing an engagement, the Red Team Lead:
Oversees coordination with all stakeholders for the purpose of engagement execution
Oversees training activities
Is responsible for maintaining and coordinating logistics and the scheduling of the
engagement space, time, and equipment
Oversees compliance with all laws, regulations, policies, programs, and operations
Is responsible for ensuring the accurate and timely completion of a final engagement
report
Red Team Operator
Red Team operators are the individuals who execute the actions required for an engagement to meet
the goals. Each Red Team operator complies with all Red Team policies and regulations under the
direction of the Red Team Lead. In general, the operator:
Executes engagement requirements as directed
Complies with all laws, regulations, policies, programs, and Rules of Engagement
Implements the team’s operational methodology and TTPs
Identifies and has input to target environment deficiencies
Researches and develops new exploit and tests tools for functionality
Performs Open Source Intelligence as required for the engagement
Identifies and assesses actions that reveal system vulnerabilities and capabilities
Assists the Red Team Lead in the development of the final engagement report
Performs physical assessment support under the direction of Red Team Lead
Executes operational impacts as approved by the ECG
Blue Cell
The blue cell is the opposite side of red. Is it all the components defending a target network. The blue
cell is typically comprised of blue team members, defenders, internal staff, and an organization’s
management.
This diagram shows the relationship and communication paths among the different groups in an
engagement. The red team lead maintains constant communication with the ECG and white cell. The
blue team lead and trusted agents maintain communication with the white cell. The dashed line from
the observers represents limited communications to the individuals overseeing an engagement.
Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The Rules of Engagement establish the responsibility, relationship, and guidelines between the Red
Team, the network owner, the system owner, and any stakeholders required for engagement execution.
This document contains all agreed-upon rules for an engagement, should be a signed official
agreement of all parties involved, is used as the formal agreement that authorizes the engagement
actions, and should be treated as law. The ROE governs the entire process of a Red Team engagement
and must be adhered to during the execution. Violation of the ROE can put a target organization or
engagement operators at risk. The seriousness of the ROE must not be taken lightly. All parties must
approve any deviation from the rules established in the ROE before execution.
ROE Document
The ROE documents the target information, approvals, threat implementation, activities, and issues
required to staff, coordinate, and execute engagements within the target environment.
The main body of the ROE (often derived from a standing template) provides information on:
The Red Team methodology
A high-level description of the types of activities that may be executed
The types of hardware and software that may be employed
A recommended deconfliction process
Levels of threat available (comparison)
Roles and responsibilities of each functional group (ECG, White Cell, TA, etc.)
The identification of and references to appropriate legal requirements (PCI, FERPA,
HIPAA, HITEC, SOX, GLBA, etc.)
A legal responsibility disclaimer (federally mandated requirements for the Red Team to
report specific findings)
Information specific to each engagement should be documented in annexes to the ROE. At a minimum,
ROE annexes should detail:
The Target of the Engagement
Organization name
Address
Specific groups or divisions
Organizational identifiers
Senior management contact info
An Engagement Contact List (name, role, phone, email, office location)
ECG personnel
White Cell
Trusted Agents
Red Team Lead
Red Tech Lead
Engagement Objectives
Conditions
Threat level
Targeted objectives
Targets of opportunity
Measures of success/failure
Authorized Target Space
Network
The IP boundaries of the event
Domains and workgroups
Specific off-limits areas and resources (e.g. non-target intellectual property
file share)
Off-limits machines, networks, equipment, or applications (blacklist)
Maintenance windows
● Physical
Areas of the campus
Buildings
Offices
Off-limits areas (e.g., the emergency services sector of a medical complex)
Off-limits materials within the target space (e.g., sensitive documents or
equipment)
Authorized Actions: Types of activities approved for the engagement
Restricted Actions: Types of activities restricted during the engagement (if any)
Approval Process
The process for requesting approval of additional activities during engagement execution
Approval process
Points of contact (name, role, phone, email, office location)
Alternate POC
The ROE must be updated when the target space, authorized actions, objectives, or scope are
changed. For instance, the original scope may be limited to computer network attacks. If physical
attacks are planned, the ROE must be updated to reflect the additional activities and controls. The
Red Team Lead will address suggestions or adjustments to the ROE. Each review must be provided
to the originator. The final ROE must be signed by a Trusted Agent in senior management of the target
environment.
Managing Risk
This section discusses risk (as a result of Red Team activities) to the target environment, NOT
inherent vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising from
engagement factors and making decisions that balance risk costs with target benefits. The objective of
managing risk is not to eliminate all risk but to remove unnecessary risk.
The engagement planning process should identify and minimize any risks that may occur either
directly or indirectly as a result of the Red Team’s activities. The objective is to implement the efforts
outlined in the ROE without causing any irreversible damage to the target environment. The ECG has
overall responsibility for implementing risk management and accepting the risk to the target
environment during the engagement. The Red Team Lead has responsibility for implementing risk
management and accepting the risk guidelines into the team’s objectives during the engagement.
Before and throughout the event, the Red Team Lead may request the TA and ECG to assess all risks
associated with current Red Team activities and vice versa.
Risk Management assists the engagement planning by:
Conserving the limited resources used throughout an engagement
Identifying potential risks early to avert this unwarranted risk
Making an informed decision as to the course of action implementation (or alternate)
Identifying feasible and effective control measures to ensure an engagement meets
assessment goals without introducing unnecessary risk to the safety and health of the
target
Providing alternatives for objective or goal accomplishment when a risk is too high.
Risk Management does not:
Limit the Red Team’s ability to operate to the degree where engagement’s goals can not
be met
Completely dissolve all risk (it manages risk)
Mandate a decision on activity (it provides guidance to the ECG on mitigations or
alternate decisions)
Have the authority to violate the law even to support the successful execution of an
engagement
Eliminate requirements for SOP and TTP exercise
What does this mean in practical execution?
Every engagement must include risk management in planning and execution. Security testers and Red
Team operators have been invited to play in someone else's playground. Care and consideration must
be appropriately handled through risk management. Risk management does not mean risk elimination.
The purpose is to identify risk early and develop a plan to handle situations where a pre-identified
risk or unknown risk is realized.
The risk management process:
1. Identify potential issues, conflicts, or hazards (life, limb, eyesight, equipment, and
production)
2. Assess each to determine the direct impact to the target environment
3. Develop controls designed to mitigate risks
