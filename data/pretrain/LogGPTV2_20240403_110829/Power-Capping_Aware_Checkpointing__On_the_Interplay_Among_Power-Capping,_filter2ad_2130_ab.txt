### Effect of Power Capping on Compute and Checkpointing Phases

#### Figure 1: Impact of Power Capping on Compute Phase
- **Power Cap Levels (watts):** 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50
- **Platforms:**
  - (a) Xeon E5-2670
  - (b) Xeon E5-2630

**Figure 1** illustrates the effect of power capping on the compute phase of benchmarks across different platforms. The figure shows that power capping significantly affects the execution time of the compute phase for all benchmarks.

#### Figure 2: Impact of Power Capping on Checkpointing Phase
- **Power Cap Levels (watts):** 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60
- **Benchmarks:** LU, SP, BT
- **Checkpointing Library:** BLCR

**Figure 2(a)** displays the power consumption during checkpointing, showing two dips corresponding to the two checkpoint phases. The power consumption under all power caps is approximately 21.4 watts.

**Figure 2(b)** shows the checkpointing time normalized by the checkpointing time without any power capping. The effect of power capping on the duration of the checkpointing phase is minimal because checkpointing is an I/O-intensive operation, and throttling CPU performance does not significantly affect I/O performance.

**Equation 2:**
\[ \beta(P_i) = \beta \]
- \(\beta\): Time needed to take a checkpoint without power capping
- \(\beta(P_i)\): Time needed to take a checkpoint under power cap \(P_i\)

**Finding 1:**
- Power capping significantly affects the execution time of the compute phase across all benchmarks on different platforms.
- This effect can be captured by an exponential function fitting.

### Power Capping Effects on Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

#### A. Power Capping Effects on Temperature

To understand how power capping affects system reliability, we first examine its impact on temperature. We perform power capping and temperature measurements on the Xeon E5-2630 and E5-2670 platforms. Each benchmark runs for 1800 seconds under ten different power caps, with steady power consumption and temperature calculated using the average of the last 30 seconds.

**Figure 3:**
- **(a) LU Temperature**
- **(b) SP Temperature**

**Figure 3** shows the representative trend for two benchmarks on the Xeon E5-2630 platform. Both benchmarks exhibit similar temperature profiles under different power caps. Similar results are observed for other benchmarks and platforms, indicating that power capping has a direct impact on temperature, independent of benchmark characteristics.

**Figure 4:**
- **(a) Xeon E5-2630 Platform**
- **(b) Core i7-2600 Platform**

**Figure 4** illustrates the temperature variation with power capping levels and fitted regression functions. The linear regression functions can be expressed as:

**Equation 3:**
\[ \text{TEMP}(P_i) = C \times P_i + D \]
- \(\text{TEMP}(P_i)\): Temperature under power cap \(P_i\)
- \(C\) and \(D\): Regression coefficients

The R-squared values of the regression functions are above 0.99 for all applications, indicating a statistically sound fit. The regression coefficients are different across platforms and cooling infrastructures.

**Finding 2:**
- Power capping level directly impacts the temperature of the processor.
- This relationship can be captured using a linear function, with the regression coefficients varying based on the platform and cooling infrastructure.
