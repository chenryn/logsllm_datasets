(b) Checkpointing Time
Fig. 2: Effect of power capping on checkpointing phase of
benchmarks: BLCR checkpointing library is used and Check-
pointing time is normalized by the checkpointing time without
any power capping.
Next, we present results that help us understand how differ-
ent power capping affects the execution time of checkpointing
phase. Checkpointing is an I/O intensive operation in contrast
to computation intensive scientiﬁc simulation applications.
Therefore, one can reasonably expect
to observe different
power capping effects on checkpointing phase than on compute
phase. We use BLCR to perform checkpointing on three
benchmarks (LU, SP, and BT). We ﬁnd similar results for other
benchmarks and platforms, but due to space limitation we only
present representative results that capture trends for all the
benchmarks. Fig. 2 shows the computing and checkpointing
power consumption and execution time on Xeon E5-2630
platform under different power caps. Notice the two dips
in the Fig. 2 (a) which is corresponding to two checkpoint
phases. Checkpointing power consumption under all power
caps are similar (approximately 21.4 watts). The effect of
power capping on checkpointing time can be captured by the
Eq. 2.
β(Pi) = β
(2)
β represents time needed to take a checkpoint without power
capping, and β(Pi) denotes time needed to take a checkpoint
3
under power cap Pi. As expected, the effect of power cap-
ping on duration of checkpointing phase is minimal because
checkpointing is an I/O intensive operation and throttling CPU
performance to save instantaneous power does not affect I/O
performance signiﬁcantly, similar to observed by previous
studies too.
Finding 1: Power capping affects the execution time of
compute phase signiﬁcantly across all benchmarks on different
platform. Further, We show that this effect can be captured by
an exponential function ﬁtting.

V. POWER CAPPING EFFECTS ON MTBF
(a) Xeon E5-2630
(b) Core i7-2600
As discussed earlier, the next step toward obtaining the op-
timal checkpointing interval under power-capping is to under-
stand how power-capping affects system reliability. However,
deriving this relationship is more challenging. We show that
this process consists of two steps. First, we show that power-
capping directly affects the temperature of the system. Second,
we show how temperature affects the system reliability.
A. Power Capping Effects on Temperature
In this section, we show that different power-capping levels
result in different steady-state temperature. First, we perform
power capping and temperature measurement on the Xeon E5-
2630 platform and E5-2670 platform. We run each benchmark
for 1800 seconds under ten different power caps. Steady
power consumption and temperature are calculated using the
average of last 30 seconds. Fig. 3 shows the representative
trend for two benchmarks on the Xeon E5-2630 platform.
Both benchmarks show almost same behavior in terms of
temperature proﬁle under different power caps. We obtained
similar results for other benchmarks and platforms, indicating
that power-capping has a direct impact on the temperature and
is largely independent of benchmark characteristics, unlike the
effect of power-capping on execution time of compute phase.

(b) SP Temperature

(Xeon E5-2630 platform).

ﬁtted regression functions on Xeon E5-2630 platform (a), and
Core i7-2600 platform (b).
same for different benchmarks on the same platform. Fig. 4 (a)
shows this for Xeon E5-2630 platform, we ﬁnd similar results
for other benchmark and platform combinations (e.g., Xeon
E52670 and E52603). The linear regression functions can be
expressed more generically as Eq. 3.
T EM P (Pi) = C × P i + D
(3)
T EM P (Pi) denotes temperature under power cap Pi.
We recognize that the relationship between power cap and
processor temperature can also depend on the cooling infras-
tructure. Heat is dissipated in the form of both heat exchange
and radiation, which grows faster as processor temperature
increases. When processor heat generation equals to heat
dissipation, processor temperature becomes steady. A powerful
cooling infrastructure can maintain a low steady processor
temperature such as in servers. Therefore, in addition to Xeon
server platforms, we also a chose a desktop-like processor
(Core i7-2600) to be able to compare and contrast our ﬁndings
with two different types of cooling infrastructures (Fig. 4(a)
and (b)). We note that repeating the exactly same experiments
for core i7-2600 is not feasible because power capping is not
supported on desktop processors. Therefore, different clock
rates are utilized to generate distinct power consumption and
temperature pairs. Steady power consumption and temperature
data of Core i7-2600 are shown in Fig. 4(b). These data points
can still be ﬁtted with linear functions as shown in the ﬁgure.
The R-squared values of regression functions are higher than
0.99 for all the applications. As PC cooling infrastructure
has less capacity as compared to server cooling infrastructure,
Core i7-2600 temperature increases much faster than Xeon E5-
2630 when power consumption is increased. This result also
illustrates that the regression co-efﬁcients are dependent on the
platform and cooling infrastructure.
To take this effect
into consideration toward obtaining
optimal checkpointing interval, we attempt
to capture this
trend mathematically. We ﬁnd that temperature under power
capping can be ﬁtted using a linear function. The R-squared
values of regression functions are above 0.99 for different
platforms indicating a statistically sound ﬁt. We ﬁnd the
regression coefﬁcients to be different across platforms, but
Finding 2: Power capping level directly impacts the
temperature of the processor. This relationship can be captured
