Hello,

I am encountering an issue while trying to install `jaxlib` on Debian Stretch with Python 3.9, even though I can successfully install `jax`. Could you please advise on the specific version requirements for `jaxlib` to work in this environment? Additionally, is it feasible to use `jaxlib` with these specifications?

Thank you in advance for any assistance!

### Dockerfile
```dockerfile
RUN echo "Installing dependencies..." && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    git

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
COPY . .
CMD sleep infinity
```

### Error Message
When running the Dockerfile, I receive the following error:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement jaxlib (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for jaxlib
The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/src/app/app.py", line 8, in <module>
    import jax
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/jax/__init__.py", line 37, in <module>
    from . import config as _config_module

    raise ModuleNotFoundError(
