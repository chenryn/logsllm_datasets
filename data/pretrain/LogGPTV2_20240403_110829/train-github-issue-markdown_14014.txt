Hi! I can install jax but not jaxlib on debian stretch with python3.9.
What version do I need to get this to work? Is it even possible?
Thanks for any help!!
Dockerfile:
    RUN echo "Installing dependencies..." && \
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        build-essential \
        git
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
    COPY . .
    CMD sleep infinity
I get this error:
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement jaxlib (from versions: none)
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for jaxlib
    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
