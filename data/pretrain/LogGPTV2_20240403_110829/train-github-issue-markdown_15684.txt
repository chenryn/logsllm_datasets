## 📝 Target only a specific keyboard-model with the remappings.
_Use case  
I have not been able to find a keyboard with a Windows keyboard-layout having
the same (or better) mechanical feel as the Apple keyboard (USB with numeric
keys) , hence I thought I could "just" remap the keys and re-label the Apple
keyboard resulting in (EG ALT->WIN, CMD-> ALT etc)._
_For my labtop usage I only need the remapping when I am using the PC in my
docking station (with the Apple keyboard attached), when I am using the built-
in keyboard I need the not-remapped functionality, thus I need a method to
differentiate between the different keyboards attached to the PC._
I have read all the current opened issues and am not able to see this request  
NB.: Using PT v0.20.1
