Limit and apply it to some of the different social networks with the
following settings. Since we already know the social graphs size—
both m and n, we select the proper r that guarantees high proba-
m, where m is the number
bility of intersection. We set r to r0
of undirected edges in the graph and r0 is computed from the birth-
day paradox formula to guarantee a given intersection probability.
In this experiment, we consider the case without an attacker, since
SybilLimit bounds the number of the Sybil identities introduced
based on the number of the attacker edges. Without considering
Sybil attacker, we increase t until the number of accepted nodes by
a trusted node (the veriﬁer) reaches a almost all honest nodes in the
social network. Then, with this t, we ﬁnd the (average) total varia-
tion distance required in each graph, which is the necessary for the
operation of these designs. It is then easy to compute the number
of accepted Sybil identities which is t × g, where g is the number
of attack edges. SybilLimit works as long as t < n
w . The result of
this experiment is in Figure 8. For more details, see [17]
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we measured mixing times of several on-line and
and information social networks which may be used for building
security defenses and communication systems. Our main ﬁnding
shows that these social networks generally have much slower mix-
ing time than the previous works anticipated. Meanwhile, we also
observed that the average mixing time is better than the worst-case
mixing time which is the standard deﬁnition of the mixing time of a
random walk on a graph, although the average mixing time is again
much higher than the ones being used. In the near future, we will
investigate building theoretical models that consider the average
case of the mixing time. We will also investigate cost models that

consider the different mixing times of social graphs and their rela-
tion of the trust model exhibited in such networks to evaluate the
overall effectiveness of design based on social networks. The later
part of the future work is motivated by the observation that some
social graphs are faster mixing than others while their underlying
trust is different.
