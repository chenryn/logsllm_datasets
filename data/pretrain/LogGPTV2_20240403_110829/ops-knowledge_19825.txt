User: In my Python script, I first launch a subprocess by subprocess.Popen(). Then later on, I want to kill that subprocess by kill -9 Pid.
What I found is that after the kill is executed, the subprocess is "stopped" because the GUI window of that process disappeared immediately. But when I perform a "ps aux" right after the kill, the same process (with same pid) is still shown in the result. The difference is the command of the process is included in a pair of () like below:

root 30506 0.0 0.0 0 0 s000 Z+ 6:13PM
  0:00.00 (sample process)

This breaks my process detect logical since the dead process still can be found by ps.
Anyone know why this is happening?
Thanks!
Assistant: Zombie processes are actually just an entry in the process table. They do not run, they don't consume memory; the entry just stays because the parent hasn't checked their exit code.
You can either do a double fork as Gonzalo suggests, or you can filter out all ps lines with a Z in the S column.
