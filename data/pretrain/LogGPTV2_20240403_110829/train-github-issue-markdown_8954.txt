I found a problem on checkbox button on touch devices (precisely iOS).  
just to be clear i'm talking about this:
         Option 1
         Option 2
         Option 3
when you select and then deselect the button the style remain selected until
you click on another button.  
I think the problem is the rollover effect that on touch devices stays on
after a click. it probably should be removed when on touch devices.
