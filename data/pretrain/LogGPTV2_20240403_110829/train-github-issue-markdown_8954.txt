I have identified an issue with the checkbox buttons on touch devices, specifically on iOS. To clarify, I am referring to the following type of interface:

- [ ] Option 1
- [ ] Option 2
- [ ] Option 3

The problem is that when a user selects and then deselects a checkbox, the visual style remains in the selected state until another checkbox is clicked. 

I believe the issue stems from the rollover effect, which persists after a tap on touch devices. This effect should be disabled for touch devices to ensure the checkboxes function correctly.
