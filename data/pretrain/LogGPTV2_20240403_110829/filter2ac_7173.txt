### Title: Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for Safety-Critical Space Systems

When considering critical infrastructure, we often overlook the enabling technologies and systems that support it. For example, agribusiness relies on weather and climate satellites, the U.S. military depends on intelligence satellites, and various transportation industries depend on the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. Much of the world's critical infrastructure is underpinned by space systems. Despite efforts to enhance the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, there has been limited focus on the cybersecurity of space systems.

Several challenges complicate the security of space systems, including technological development, ownership, and management perspectives. These challenges have led to a lack of standardized guidance and policies for securing space systems. This presentation addresses these issues in several key areas:

1. **Recent Cybersecurity Threats and Motivations**:
   - We begin by examining recent major cybersecurity threats to space systems.
   - We also explore the potential motivations behind cybercriminals and nation-states that might target these systems.

2. **Perspectives on Securing Space Systems**:
   - Next, we discuss the various perspectives required to effectively secure space systems, including technical, operational, and regulatory viewpoints.

3. **Honeywell's Security Risk Assessment Technique**:
   - The majority of the presentation focuses on a Honeywell-developed technique for assessing security risks in safety-critical systems, such as space systems. This method provides a structured approach to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.

4. **Next Steps in Advancing Cybersecurity**:
   - We conclude with a discussion on possible next steps to advance cybersecurity for space systems, including the development of new standards and the implementation of robust policies.

By addressing these areas, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of cybersecurity in space systems and offer actionable insights for improving their security.
