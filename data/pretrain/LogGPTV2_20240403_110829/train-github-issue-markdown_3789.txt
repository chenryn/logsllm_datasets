**Current behavior**  
When listening to a native event such as `(window:mousemove)` the component is
marked for check.
**Expected behavior**
> When using OnPush detectors, then the framework will check an OnPush
> component when any of its input properties changes, when it fires an event,
> or when an observable fires an event
**Note:** It says that the angular will only check it if an input changes, it
fires an output, or an observable fires an output. I can see how this could be
considered an `observable` but I wouldn't think of a native event as
`observable`.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
If a component wants to listen to a native event it has to manually listen to
that event using browser apis if it wants to avoid the change detector. This
isn't great.
