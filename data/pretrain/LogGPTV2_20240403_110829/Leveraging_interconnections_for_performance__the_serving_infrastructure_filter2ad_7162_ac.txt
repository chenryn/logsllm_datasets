ViewP, we find 21.1M unique AS paths in ViewP to reach
the 0.9M observed prefixes seen in that dataset, but for the
1.85M encountered unique originating prefixes in ViewA, we
only observe 3.7M unique AS paths in ViewA.
Zooming in on these observed 3.7M unique AS paths seen
in ViewA, we find that 2.5M or 68% of them are not present in
ViewP. Moreover, as summarized in Table 4 (right half), the
overlap in observed AS paths between ViewA and ViewP is
small and uneven ś the 1.1M AS paths seen in both datasets
make up 30% of the AS paths seen in ViewA, but only 5% of
the AS paths seen in ViewP. Together, these results show that
not only does Akamai’s mapping system ingest less than 15%
of the unique AS paths encountered in ViewP but that given
the relative stability of the number of AS paths in ViewA
over time, a significant number of the AS paths in ViewP are
largely irrelevant for the operation of Akamai.
Next, Figure 2b shows a barplot of the number of unique
IPv4 prefixes for which there exist exactly k AS paths (k ≤ 30)
from which Akamai can choose from. Here, each bar shows
the number of prefixes separate for short (i.e., /0 -/24) and
long (/25 - /32) IPv4 prefixes. We observe that about 55% of
the IPv4 prefixes seen in ViewA have only a single AS path
(not shown here: this number jumps to 93% if we consider
instead the IPv4 prefixes seen exclusively in ViewA) and that
prefixes of length /25 or longer are typically only reachable
via a single AS path. To contrast, for ViewP, we find 10 or
more different paths for 81% of its IPv4 prefixes.
Figure 2c depicts the distribution of AS path lengths for
ViewA and shows a median path length of three AS hops
and a maximum path length of 15 AS hops (not shown here:
ViewP results in a similar plot, though with a maximum
path length of 22 AS hops).3 Note that the bar at path length
zero corresponds to the cases where Akamai’s deployment
is in the same AS as the prefix associated with the path. As
expected, in most such cases, Akamai’s deployments know
about only a single path to those prefixes.
3.3 Akamai’s Connectivity Fabric
Our focus in this section is on identifying the set of Internet
interconnections or peerings that Akamai uses to deliver
content from its EUF delivery clusters to the prefixes that
requested that content and were observed in ViewA.
3.3.1 Explicit Peerings. As defined in Section 1, the łex-
plicitž peerings of a network A can be identified by parsing
the AS path information that is maintained, collected and
transmitted by BGP. Also recall that explicit peerings involv-
ing Akamai can only be established in its Type 3 and Type 4
deployments where Akamai operates its own border routers
that participate in BGP and represent the Akamai-side of
any of its explicit peerings.
We search ViewA for the next hop ASNs of each Type 3
and Type 4 deployment and count the number of unique
next hop ASNs of Akamai. Note that this count represents
the ground truth for the set of Akamai’s explicit peerings
because the Akamai-owned routers supply Akamai’s BGP
collectors with the best routes they receive from the BGP
sessions they have with all their peers. In total, we find 6,111
such unique neighbor ASes or explicit peerings for Akamai
(some 10% of all routeable ASes seen in ViewA). More than
6,000 of the neighbor ASes are learned from IXPs (i.e., from
Type 3 deployments) and the remaining 200 or so from Type
4 deployments; see Table 5 (left half) for a breakdown by
deployment type and IP version.
Knowing the total number of explicit peerings does not
provide the full picture of this set of interconnections. To
provide more details, Figure 3 (right half) uses a box plot
to show the number of explicit peerings per deployment
for Type 3 and Type 4 deployments, respectively. Analyzing
those explicit peerings even further, we find that the number
of peering locations per explicit peering is highly skewed:
3We observe that the longest AS paths are inflated by routing loops.

out of all the 6,111 explicit peerings, Akamai sees 50 of them
at 25 or more deployments, 290 at 10 or more deployments,
and 859 of them at 5 or more deployments.
To illustrate how the established ground truth for Aka-
mai’s set of 6,111 explicit peerings stacks up against what is
typically visible in publicly available BGP data, we examine
ViewP for explicit peerings that involve Akamai. We search
ViewP’s AS paths, count the number of unique ASNs preced-
ing or following Akamai’s peering ASN, and find a total of
450 such ASNs or explicit peerings. On the one hand, seeing
Akamai’s peering AS in ViewP is fully expected since as an
active participant in BGP, Akamai must advertise some of
its own prefixes to receive traffic, for example in the form of
content from its customers. At the same time, encountering
only such a small number of explicit peerings is a reminder
that based on control-plane information alone, it is impos-
sible for a third-party observer to see another network’s
bilateral (explicit) peerings in a given location [40]. Even if
two networks peer multilaterally at the same location, they
may not receive the same BGP information.
3.3.2
Implicit Peerings. As defined in Section 1, Akamai’s
łimplicitž peerings can neither be identified nor associated
with Akamai by parsing the AS path information available in
collected BGP data. In particular, since the presence of Aka-
mai inside a hosting network is hidden from BGP, its implicit
peerings cannot be studied using ViewP. Also recall (see Ta-
ble 5) that while Akamai’s Type 1 and Type 2 deployments
do not contribute to Akamai’s explicit peerings, as integrated
parts of a given hosting network, they are pertinent for de-
termining the implicit peerings that Akamai łinheritsž from
this hosting network. Specifically, Type 1 deployments can
serve the host AS as well as the host’s downstream customers
(assuming the downstream customers permit it) and Type
2 deployments can serve the hosting (transit) network and
its downstreams. Finally, for reasons also mentioned in Sec-
tion 1, we further divide Akamai’s implicit peerings into
downstream- and upstream-related implicit peerings and
quantify in the following their contributions to Akamai’s
connectivity fabric separately.
First, checking ViewA for downstream-related implicit
peerings, we find that Akamai utilizes a total of 28,353 unique
