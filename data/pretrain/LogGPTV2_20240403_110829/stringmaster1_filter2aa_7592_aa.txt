            cout                     (Cost: 1)
    Swaps the char at index1 with the char at index2
[2] replace                    (Cost: 1)
    Replaces the first occurence of char1 with char2
[3] print                                    (Cost: 1)
    Prints the current version of the string
[4] quit
    Give up and leave the game
String1: pemgklfswr
String2: cpkscqhfsk
Enter the command you want to execute:
[1] swap                     (Cost: 1)
[2] replace                    (Cost: 1)
[3] print                                    (Cost: 1)
[4] quit
```
After playing around a bit, I tried replacing a letter which isn't present in the string:
```
String1: cxreaxqrqc
String2: auvvlvepeo
Enter the command you want to execute:
[1] swap                     (Cost: 1)
[2] replace                    (Cost: 1)
[3] print                                    (Cost: 1)
[4] quit
> replace c d
cd0
Enter the command you want to execute:
[1] swap                     (Cost: 1)
[2] replace                    (Cost: 1)
[3] print                                    (Cost: 1)
[4] quit
> replace x z
xz1
Enter the command you want to execute:
[1] swap                     (Cost: 1)
[2] replace                    (Cost: 1)
[3] print                                    (Cost: 1)
[4] quit
> print
dzreaxqrqc
Enter the command you want to execute:
[1] swap                     (Cost: 1)
[2] replace                    (Cost: 1)
[3] print                                    (Cost: 1)
[4] quit
> replace v m

```
Instead of printing the index which was replaced, the program printed 18446744073709551615, which is UINT64_MAX (and also `std::string::npos`, which is returned by `std::string::find` if no matches were found when searching for the first occurrence of a character):
