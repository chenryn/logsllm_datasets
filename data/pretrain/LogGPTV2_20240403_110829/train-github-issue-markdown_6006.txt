The REPL's pathname tab completion inserts backslashes before spaces in paths,
which results in an invalid string because `\ ` is not a valid escape. For
example, if you create a file named `"foo bar"`
    julia> touch("foo bar")
    "foo bar"
and then type `"foo` in the REPL, you get:
    julia> "foo\ bar"  
    ERROR: syntax: invalid escape sequence
    Stacktrace:
     [1] top-level scope at REPL[1]:0
These backslashes seem very shell-like â€” what are they doing in Julia
filenames?
