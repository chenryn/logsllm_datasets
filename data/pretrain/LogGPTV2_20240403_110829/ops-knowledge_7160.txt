User: You are now responsible for the project management of a multinational IT company and need to coordinate professional teams from multiple countries. Please provide an efficient project management tool and method to maintain project schedule and report work progress
Assistant: 1. Use cloud collaboration tools: such as Google Docs, Microsoft Teams or Asana. These tools can help teams work together across geographies, edit and share various files and documents simultaneously. 2. Set clear milestones and timetables: Before the project starts, develop a clear workflow, including detailed tasks and milestones. Throughout the project, the schedule is continually updated and adjusted to ensure that dates for delivery of the product or service to the client are adhered to. 3. Update project progress in real time: Use mature project management software, such as JIRA or Trello, to update project progress to working group members anytime, anywhere to help monitor project progress and adjust task assignments based on risks and changes. 4. Cultivate transparency: Maintain communication with customers and other relevant stakeholders, provide regular progress updates, and report any changes, issues and solutions, and decisions. Make sure team members get all the important information before making relevant decisions. 5. Develop good communication habits: We recommend real-time online meetings and avoid compressing all meetings into one meeting. In addition, ensure that everyone's opinions are fully expressed, solve problems that may arise at any time, maintain project progress, and assist in achieving better project management.
