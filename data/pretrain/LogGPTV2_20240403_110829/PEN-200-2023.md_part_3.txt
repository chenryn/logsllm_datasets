### Learning Modules and Challenge Labs

**Learning Modules** cover specific penetration testing concepts or techniques, while **Challenge Labs** require learners to apply the skills acquired through these modules. Each Learning Module is divided into **Learning Units**, which are atomic pieces of content designed to help learners achieve specific learning objectives.

### Overview of This Learning Module

In this module, we will cover the following Learning Units:
- Getting Started with PWK
- How to Approach the Course
- Summary of PWK Learning Modules

### 2.1 Getting Started with PWK

#### 2.1.1 Learning Objectives
- Take inventory of what’s included in the course
- Set up an Attacking Kali VM
- Connect to the PWK VPN

#### 2.1.2 Introduction
Much like learning to play a musical instrument, security training requires a balance of conceptual knowledge and hands-on practice. In this Learning Unit, we will explore the materials included in PWK, how to set up our attacking Kali VM, and how to connect to the PWK labs via a VPN.

### 2.1.3 PWK Course Materials

The course includes online access to the Learning Modules and their accompanying course videos. The information covered in the modules and videos overlaps, allowing you to read the modules and then watch the videos to fill in any gaps, or vice versa. In some cases, the modules may be more detailed, while in others, the videos may convey the information better. It is important to pay close attention to both.

**Exercises in the Learning Modules:**
- Some exercises involve simple question-and-answer tasks where the learner retrieves the solution from the text.
- Other exercises have three components: a question, a machine (or group of machines), and a flag. The learner must perform a specific action on the provided machine to obtain a flag in the form `OS{random-hash}`. This flag can then be submitted to the OffSec Learning Portal (OLP) to track progress.

**Note:** Flags are dynamically generated at machine boot and expire at machine shutdown. Ensure the flag is submitted before reverting or powering off the machine.

**SSH Connection:**
When connecting to Module Exercise VMs that require an SSH connection, use the following command to prevent corruption of the known-hosts file on your local Kali machine:
```bash
ssh -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
```

**Module Exercises:**
- Currently supported on the x86-64 Kali Linux version exclusively.

### 2.1.4 Student Mentors and Support

**Discord Access:**
- Discord, our community chat platform, can be accessed via the Profile drop-down in the OffSec Learning Portal.
- Live Support allows direct communication with Student Mentors and the Student Technical Services Team.

**Support Teams:**
- **Technical Services Team:** Assists with technical issues.
- **Student Mentors:** Clarify course material and exercises, and provide hints if you are stuck.

**Tips for Effective Communication:**
- Provide as much detail as possible about what you have tried and the outcomes observed to get the best assistance.

### 2.1.5 Setting Up Kali

**Lab Environment Components:**
- Your Kali Linux VM
- The OffSec Learning Portal
- A lab containing deployable target machines
- A VPN connection between your Kali VM and the lab

**Kali Linux:**
- An open-source operating system specifically tailored for penetration testing and other information security activities.
- Recommended to install Kali on a VM using a hypervisor like VMware Workstation Player (Windows) or VMware Fusion (Mac).

**VMware Image:**
- Use the latest VMware image available on the OffSec VM image download page.
- Only the indicated VMware images are supported.

### 2.1.6 Connecting to the PWK Lab

**VPN Connection:**
- Many Module exercises and all lab machines require a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.
- A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel, allowing secure data transfer over the public Internet.

**Connecting to the VPN:**
1. Start the Kali VM and open a browser.
2. Navigate to the OffSec Learning Portal and sign in.
3. Go to the Course drop-down menu and select PEN200.
4. Download the .ovpn file from the VPN drop-down menu.
5. Use the terminal to connect to the VPN:
   ```bash
   sudo openvpn pen200.ovpn
   ```

**TUN0 Network Interface:**
- Once connected, you will be assigned a TUN0 network interface with an IP address in the format `192.168.119.X`.
- All lab machines will have addresses in the format `192.168.X.Y`.

**Lab Time:**
- Starts when your course begins and is metered as continuous access.
- Purchase additional lab time via the Extend link in the OffSec Training Library.

### 2.2 How to Approach the Course

#### 2.2.1 Learning Objectives
- Conceptualize a learning model based on increasing uncertainty
- Understand the different learning components included in PWK

#### 2.2.2 A Model of Increasing Uncertainty

Penetration testing, like information security in general, involves reasoning under uncertainty. Unlike chess, where all information is known, penetration testing is more like poker, where decisions are made with incomplete data. When simulating an attack, we make assumptions and estimate probabilities. As defenders, we need to hedge our bets and ensure that the most likely attack surfaces are adequately protected.

By understanding and embracing this model of increasing uncertainty, you will be better prepared to tackle the challenges in the PWK course.
