The command shows us that we should be able to access hosts in the 192.168.50.0/24 subnet
through the ens192 interface, and hosts in the 10.4.50.0/24 subnet through the ens224 interface.
Continuing our enumeration, we’ll find the Confluencye configuration file at
/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence/confluence.cfg.xml. While reading the contents using
cat, we discover some plaintext database credentials located within.

Listing 526 - The credentials found in the Confluence confluence.cfg.xml file on CONFLUENCE01.
We’ll find the IP address of the database server, as well as the plain text username and password
used to connect to it. We can use these credentials to authenticate to the database and continue
our enumeration.
We’ve hit a limitation, however. CONFLUENCE01 doesn’t have a PostgreSQL client installed on it.
Since we are running as the low-privileged confluence user, we are also unable to easily install
software.
We do have the PostgreSQL client psql installed on our Kali machine, but we can’t connect directly
to PGDATABASE01 from our Kali machine, since it’s only routable from CONFLUENCE01.
In this scenario, there is no firewall in place between our Kali machine and CONFLUENCE01,
meaning that there is nothing stopping us from binding ports on the WAN interface of
CONFLUENCE01 and connecting to them from our Kali machine.

This is exactly the type of situation in which port forwarding can be useful. We can create a port
forward on CONFLUENCE01 that listens on a port on the WAN interface, then forward all packets
received on this port to the PGDATABASE01 on the internal subnet. In the next section, we will
use Socat901 to achieve this.
18.2.3 Port Forwarding with Socat
Now we are ready to create a port forward. We have an idea of how we want it to work:
CONFLUENCE01 should listen on a port on the WAN interface and forward all packets received
on this port to the PGDATABASE01 on the internal subnet. This concept is illustrated in the
following diagram:
y
k
s
o
n
i
z
Figure 243: The way we expect our port forward to work
We want to open TCP port 2345 on the WAN interface of CONFLUENCE01, then connect to that
D
port from our Kali machine. We want all the packets that we send to this port to be forwarded by
CONFLUENCE01 to TCP port 5432 on PGDATABASE01. Once we set up our port forward,
connecting to TCP port 2345 on CONFLUENCE01 will be exactly like connecting directly to TCP
port 5432 on PGDATABASE01.
As part of our enumeration of CONFLUENCE01, we’ll find Socat installed. Socat is a general-
purpose networking tool that can set up a simple port forward in a single command.
In this scenario, we find it already installed, but Socat does not tend to be
installed by default on *NIX systems. If not already installed, it’s possible to
download and run a statically-linked binary version instead.
We will use Socat to set up the port forward we want on CONFLUENCE01. It will listen on a port
on the WAN interface (that our Kali machine can connect to) and forward packets received on
that port to PGDATABASE01.

On CONFLUENCE01, we’ll start a verbose (-ddd) Socat process. It will listen on TCP port 2345
(TCP-LISTEN:2345), fork into a new subprocess when it receives a connection (fork) instead of
dying after a single connection, then forward all traffic it receives to TCP port 5432 on
PGDATABASE01 (TCP:10.4.50.215:5432).
We’ll listen on port 2345 as it’s not in the privileged port range (0-1024), which
means we don’t need elevated privileges to use it.

With the Socat process running, we can run psql on our Kali machine, specifying that we want to
connect to CONFLUENCE01 (-h 192.168.50.63) on port 2345 (-p 2345) with the postgres user
account (-U postgres). When prompted, we will enter the password, and once connected, we can
run the \l command to list the available databases.

Success! We’ve connected to the PostgreSQL database throukgh our port forward. We’ll also find
that we have access to the confluence database.

Using our new database access, we can continue our enumeration. In the confluence database,
let’s query the cwd_user table. This contains the username and password hashes for all
Confluence users. We’ll connect to the database woith the \c confluence command, then run select

Listing 529 - The contents of the cwd_user table in the confluence database.
We receive several rows of user information. Eacho row contains data for a single Confluence user,
including their password hash. We will use Hashcat902 to try to crack these.
The Hashcat mode number for Atlassian (nPBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1) hashes903 is 12001, so we can
pass that to the -m mode flag. After copying the hashes into a file called hashes.txt, we’ll pass
this as the first positional argument. We can then pass the fastrack.txt password list that’s built

It appears that the password policy for this Confluence instance isn’t very strong. After only a few
minutes of cracking, Hashcat returns passwords for the database_admin, hr_admin and
rdp_admin users.
We might suspect that these passwords are reused in other places throughout the network. After
some more enumeration of the internal network, we’ll find PGDATABASE01 is also running an
SSH server. Let’s try these credentials against this SSH server. With our new port forwarding skill,
we can create a port forward on CONFLUENCE01 that will allow us to SSH directly from our Kali
machine to PGDATABASE01.
First, we need to kill the original Socat process listening on TCP port 2345. We’ll then create a new
port forward with Socat that will listen on TCP port 2222 and forward to TCP port 22 on
PGDATABASE01.
confluence@confluence01:/opt/atlassian/confluence/bin$ socat yTCP-LISTEN:2222,fork
TCP:10.4.50.215:22

Figure 245: Using Socat to open a port forward from CONFLUENCE01 to the SSH server on PGDATABASE01
There are only very minimal differences between this and the previous network setup. Instead of
listening on 2345, we are listening on 2222. Instead of forwarding to TCP port 5432 on
PGDATABASE01, we are forwarding to TCP port 22 on PGDATABASE01.
We’ll then use our SSH client to connect to port 2222 on CONFLUENCE01, as though we are
connecting directly to port 22 on PGDATABASE01. We can use the database_admin user, and the
password we just cracked using Hashcat.

Listing 532 - Connecting to SSH server on PGDATABASE01, through the port forward on CONFLUENCE01.
Success! The database_admDin credentials have been reused here. We have managed to connect
to the SSH server on PGDATABASE01 using the credentials for database_admin we found in the
PostgreSQL database through the port forward we set up on CONFLUENCE01 with Socat.
In this Learning Unit, we created some simple port forwards using Socat. These allowed us to
gain deeper access within a network by leveraging our existing access to a compromised host.
It should also be noted that Socat is not the only way to create port forwards on *NIX hosts.
There are several alternatives, of note:
• rinetd904 is an option that runs as a daemon. This makes it a better solution for longer-term
