I'm in the middle of a migration from C++ and I'm having a hard time in
understanding Julia "slices".
I have a vector `a`. When I do `b=a[1:2]` and `b[1] = 10` for example, `a` is
not affected.  
That is, the "slicing" operation `a[1:2]` creates a copy instead of working
with the original data.
Is this a bug or intended behavior?
If it is intended behavior, what is the correct way of getting a reference to
a piece of the original vector? (whose type is still Vector, not SubArray; I
have functions with explicit type annotations for type safety).
