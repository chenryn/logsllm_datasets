If a parent object of the Bootstrap Carousel is hidden using the jQuery
.hide() method while the Carousel is in the middle of animating to a new
slide, the Carousel will no longer animate when the same parent is unhidden
using the jQuery .show() method.
This can be duplicated on the Carousel demo page found here:
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
In a debug console on that page, one can hide the Carousel's parent by using
the following javascript:  
$("section#carousel").hide()
and then show it's parent again using this line:  
$("section#carousel").show()
If the parent is hidden when the demo images are moving between slides, and
then shown again later, there is no way to trigger the animations again until
the page is reloaded.
At a first pass, it looks like this.sliding is never reset back to false
unless the animations are able to finish correctly. Hiding the parent seems to
cancel the animations without their events triggering a reset of the
this.sliding variable.
When I tried adding a "reset" that would put this.sliding back to false, it
still didn't work. I'm not sure what I'm missing.
I have been unable to find a suitable workaround so far.
