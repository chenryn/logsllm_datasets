ABSTRACT
Duty-cycling has emerged as the predominant method for
optimizing power consumption of low-power radios, partic-
ularly for sensors that transmit sporadically in small bursts.
But duty-cycling is a poor fit for applications involving high-
rate sensor data from wearable sensors such as IMUs, micro-
phones, and imagers that need to stream data to the cloud
to execute sophisticated machine learning models.
We argue that there is significant room to optimize low-
power radios if we can take advantage of channel dynamics
in short-range settings. However, we face challenges in de-
signing radios that are efficient at power levels between
µWs and mWs to take advantage of periods of good signal
strength and nimble to deal with highly dynamic channels
resulting from body movements. To achieve this, we propose
radio polymorphism, a radio architecture with tightly inte-
grated passive and active components that allows us to turn
high channel dynamics to our advantage. We leverage pas-
sive modes in myriad ways within the network stack, from
minimizing data transfer and control overheads to improv-
ing rate selection and enabling channel-aware opportunistic
transmission. We instantiate our design in a full hardware-
software prototype, Morpho, and demonstrate up to an order
of improvement in efficiency across diverse scenarios and
applications.

standard that enables rapid connection establishment, trans-
mission of a short burst of information, and rapid disconnec-
tion. This rapid transition time makes it possible to mask
the power consumed during active operation of the radio,
which is milliwatts compared to microwatts in sleep mode.
As a result, duty-cycled radios like Bluetooth LE and Zigbee
have become the preferred choice for sensors that transmit
sporadically in small bursts, for example, home tempera-
ture monitoring, location beacons, security alarms, humidity
sensors, and other similar IoT devices.
But duty-cycling is insufficient for applications involving
high-rate sensor data from IMUs, ECG, microphones, and
imagers, that are used in wearable and tactile computing
applications. The signals from these devices are noisy and
complex which makes data interpretation a significant chal-
lenge [42]. To address this problem, we often need sophisti-
cated machine learning techniques that are more complex
than what we can execute locally and require computational
resources in the cloud. The end result is a growing need for
low-power radios that can support continuous streaming
rather than transfer in short, intermittent bursts.
This trend has significant consequences from a power per-
spective. Normally, we would expect high-rate sensors to
be the bottleneck in terms of power consumption but this
has changed in recent years. For example, state-of-art low-
power microphones, cameras, IMUs and ECG chips in the
market consume between tens of microwatts and a few milli-
watts for continuous sampling [9, 16, 27, 50]. But streaming
communication has not kept pace with sensor developments
Ð active mode power consumption of low-power radios is
around ten milliwatts, which is an order of magnitude higher
than the sensors. Continuous streaming of sensor data for
real-time applications means that the radio needs to wake
up frequently and cannot batch data before transmission. In
these regimes, the prevailing wisdom of using duty-cycling
to judiciously use the radio is ineffective.
In this paper, we argue that there

is significant room for optimization in the form of large gaps
between received signal strength and receiver sensitivity.
But these gaps often occur at extremely low power levels,

noise given the channel bandwidth, the noise added by re-
ceiver electronics, and the required signal to noise ratio for
the modulation scheme being used. In the case of Bluetooth,
the thermal noise is -114 dBm for a 1 MHz channel [39] and
the receive sensitivity is around -96 dBm at 1 Mbps [34]. As
a result, in short range settings, the signal strength is often
about 35 dB higher than receive sensitivity.
2.1 Leveraging the RSS-Sensitivity Gap
Thus, we often have a dramatic 30-40 dB gap between the re-
ceived signal and the receiver sensitivity, but can we convert
the opportunity into comparable power savings? There are
two potential designs that can leverage this gap Ð transmit
power adaptation and radio duty-cycling.
Transmit softly: Transmit power adaptation essentially
involves reducing power consumption by dropping the out-
put power of the transmitter so that the RSS becomes closer
to the noise floor of the receiver. However, this does not
lead to proportional power savings since the baseline oper-
ation of a low-power radio is already at a very low power
level. For example, when a typical low-power radio transmits
at 0dBm (i.e. output power of 1mW), the RF analog circuit
consumes only around 5-10mW. If we wanted to reduce the
output power from 0dBm to -30dBm (i.e. 1mW to 1µW) to
take advantage of the gap, then we would need the RF analog
circuit to operate at 10µW to achieve proportional power
savings. But this is not possible due to the constant over-
heads of the active elements in a radio. In fact, the oscillator
alone in a low-power radio consumes a few hundred mi-
crowatts, so power efficiency would be less than 1% when
the output power is 1 µW [29]. Any other active elements
like active mixers would only add to this overhead. Some of
this inefficiency is apparent when we measure commercial
low-power radios. For example, the Nordic nRF52840 BLE
chip [34] draws 4.8mA when the transmit power level is
0 dBm and 2.3 mA at -40 dBm i.e. a 50% reduction in current
draw for a four orders of magnitude reduction in transmit
power. Thus, the fixed costs of a low-power radio swamp
any gains that can be achieved by reducing transmit power.
Transmit rapidly: Radio duty-cycling involves transmit-
ting at as high a bitrate as possible and saving energy by
sleeping for longer. A higher speed PHY achieves lower
power consumption (given that the same amount of data
is transferred) since the radio-on time is reduced without
changing transmit power. This is the approach used by virtu-
ally all low-power IoT radios. For example, BLE is typically
configured to operate at either 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps to reduce
power consumption.
But duty-cycling has two side-effects. The first is that the
radio has no visibility into channel variations during radio-
off periods. This means that mechanisms like rate adaptation
are less effective in a duty-cycled radio since the channel
may have changed since the last radio-on period. As a result,
bitrates are often set to a fixed value in duty-cycled radios.
The second is that constant overheads are significant for
each wakeup. For example, a typical BLE radio goes through
several stages during each wakeup cycle including MCU
wakeup and shutdown, BLE protocol stack preparations and
processing, and the radio on-off transitions [22]. The actual
data transmission consumes only a fraction of the overall
energy during each wakeup. These constant overheads can
be masked if the messages are infrequent as is the case with
BLE or when we can batch data to amortize the overheads.
But they cannot be masked when streaming sensor data to
the edge cloud. For example, real-time streaming of data
from a microphone to an edge cloud (16 bits @ 8 kHz) via a
2 MHz Bluetooth radio would involve thousands of wakeups
per second.
2.2 The Morpho Approach
We propose a new design paradigm that combines active
radio architectures (i.e. RF oscillators, I/Q receivers, active
mixers, power amplifiers, and low-noise amplifiers) with
passive radio architectures (i.e. backscatter transmitters and
envelope detectors). Such a design allows us to tackle the
above issues in two ways. First, the constant overheads are
a non-issue for passive radio architectures which do not
have active components. Second, passive transmitters and
receivers can operate in always-on mode and do not have
to be duty-cycled since there is virtually no energy cost to
using them. These advantages open up new possibilities in
terms of how we can design low-power streaming radios.
But passive radios present a number of challenges that
make it non-trivial to design an integrated active-passive
architecture. In the case of a passive transmitter (i.e. backscat-
ter), the main issue is substantially higher path-loss. Since
the backscatter signal has to traverse the forward path and
the reverse path, the attenuation is exponentially greater
than an active radio where the signal only needs to traverse
the forward path. In effect, this is a double-whammy since
the signal average is considerably lower than an active radio,
and the signal dynamics is a considerably exaggerated ver-
sion as that for an active radio. The challenge is not limited to
the transmitter Ð a passive receiver (envelope detector) also
presents problems since its sensitivity is often considerably
lower than an active receiver. Thus, when we integrate these
two vastly different radio architectures, we need to carefully
consider how we accentuate their positives and mask their
idiosyncracies in-order to improve performance.
Morpho presents a unification of active and passive mod-
ules into a single radio that transparently switches across
these modules to optimize energy-efficiency without losing

Figure 2: We illustrate the main ideas in Morpho for uplink transmission. Active-assisted Backscatter shows the
case where backscatter works at sufficiently high bitrate most of the time, so the active radio is only needed as
backup when backscatter fails. Backscatter-assisted Active shows the case where backscatter cannot support a
high bitrate for data, but it can be used at very low bitrate for zero-power channel measurements. This enhanced
visibility allows us to choose the best bitrate and time to use the active radio, thereby improving efficiency.
robustness. The application is agnostic to the manner in
which Morpho switches between modules even when it in-
cludes rapid transitions needed to handle highly dynamic
channels that are typical in mobile situations. Our vision is
to enable a deep stack integration, where the physical layer,
protocol layer, and application layer are all re-architected
to squeeze the most out of opportunities to use passive ra-
dio modes without sacrificing the intrinsic robustness of
low-power active radios.
3 DESIGN RATIONALE & KEY INSIGHTS
How should we combine active and passive modes to design a
unified radio? When considering the answer to this question,
we found that there are two distinct approaches to unify the
two modes. We describe these approaches in this section.
3.1 Active-Assisted Passive
The first method for combining active and passive modes is
somewhat evident Ð use the passive mode whenever avail-
able for data transfer since it has better energy-efficiency
and use the active mode to smooth out periods when the
passive mode is flaky. We refer to this mode as active-assisted
passive since passive is the preferred data transfer mode and
active is backing it up by filling connectivity gaps.
Let us first consider the case of a peripheral (e.g. IoT sen-
sor) transmitting to a central station (e.g. access point) via
a polymorphic radio. Here, the choice is between transmit-
ting via a (passive) backscatter transmitter or via an (active)
I/Q transmitter. This scenario is shown in Figure 2(a) Ð the
bold line is the active signal strength and the grey line is the
backscatter version of the same signal. The dotted horizontal
line represents the receive sensitivity at a desired data rate,
100kbps in this example. The backscatter signal has lower
RSS and higher signal variation compared to the active sig-
nal, but despite this the signal is mostly above the receiver
sensitivity and can be decoded. In this case, backscatter can
be used for data transmission most of the time with active be-
ing used as backup whenever the backscatter signal strength
goes below the receive sensitivity.
We note that there are several parameters that can be
tuned to change the operating region shown in the figure.
The first is the carrier signal power from the central station.
The second is the acceptable bitrate Ð the receive sensitivity
line in Figure 2(a) can be lowered if the acceptable bitrate
for the passive mode is less than the stated 100 kbps figure.
This approach is equally applicable to the case of a pe-
ripheral receiving data from the central station. Here, the
peripheral has to decide whether to use the (passive) enve-
lope detector or to use an (active) I/Q detector. In an active-
assisted passive approach, the peripheral uses the passive
mode whenever the received signal is strong enough to use
the passive envelope detector as the primary receiver, and
the active mode kicks in when the signal falls below the
sensitivity of the passive receiver (at the desired bitrate).
3.2 Passive-assisted Active
While active-assisted passive is ideal under conditions where
the passive modes offer sufficient throughput, there are often
449
Polymorphic Radio

conditions where bitrate offered by the passive mode is too
low. For example, when active RSS is -65 dBm, the corre-
sponding active bitrate for 16-QAM modulation is 4 Mbps
whereas the corresponding backscatter bitrate would be
∼5 kbps. Thus, there are often scenarios where the difference
in throughput between active and passive mode is too high
for active-assisted passive to be practical. The question we
ask is whether we can still leverage the passive modes to
improve the performance in these situations.
Our main insight is that even though backscatter may be
