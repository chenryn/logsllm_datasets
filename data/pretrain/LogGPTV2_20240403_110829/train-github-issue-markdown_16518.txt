 **Describe the bug**
When importing Spotlights from GLB, their target seems to be reset after page
reload, resulting in different lighting / broken scene.
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Go to https://threejs.org/editor/
  2. Import World.zip
  3. Note spotlights shining from above
  4. Refresh page
  5. Note spotlights all shining towards (0,0,0)
**Expected behavior**
Spotlights still work after page reload
**Screenshots**

Note: it seems that generally, when creating a spotlight the target can't be
moved in the threejs editor. Is this expected? Should I open a separate issue
for this?
