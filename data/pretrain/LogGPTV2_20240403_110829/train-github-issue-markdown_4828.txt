The pluralization of rest resource names in URL paths is mostly human conceit
that complicates every interaction from clients and leads to little practical
benefit for end users. In addition, it's an arbitrary transformation that
cannot lead to predictable results.
The use of pluralization is entirely historical, and is not based on any
pattern other than making readable urls for bookmarking in a web browser. That
is not the same use case as a well constructed API - the set of end users who
create urls against our API are extremely limited.
I believe for v2 versions of our APIs and new API resources we should abandon
pluralization in our URL paths. We can continue to support the old paths as
aliases throughout each published API version, but removing the arbitrary
process of generating a plurals will allow future api logic to be simpler.
Ie:
/api/v1/namespace/foo/pod/bar/subresource
