User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to find "growing" files inside a linux system I have a server that is constantly losing disk space so I reckon there must be some logs that I'm not aware of.

What is a good way to locate files that are constantly increasing in size?

Assistant: There is an utility called gt5 that displays current directory sizes as well as the difference from the last time you've checked.
