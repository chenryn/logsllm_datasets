Proof. Consider the metagraph Gk with n
k nodes for some constant k that we shall deﬁne. Let B be the set
(cid:1)
of nodes in G that have a blue pebble at some point, and let Bm be the set of meta-nodes that contain some
k : [i, i + (cid:96) − 1]. By Lemma 5.3,
node in B. Partition the second half of graph G into intervals of size (cid:96) = n
there exists a constant α such that for k = αn 1

and that the middle
k/3 nodes of a meta-node must be pebbled for two meta-nodes that are connected in Gk, it follows that
3 = Ω(n) nodes must be pebbled. Thus, the cost of pebbling [i, i + (cid:96) − 1] is at least
βn/k − m − |Bk| meta-nodes in Gk for some constant β. Noting that m = O(cid:16)

(Sketch) Repeatedly invoke the previous lemma. Consider an optimal red-blue

between steps ti−1 + 1 and ti starting from some red-blue conﬁguration Bti−1 , Rti−1 is at least
