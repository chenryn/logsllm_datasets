**User:**
I am using Python 2.7.1, and I am unable to figure out how to launch the IDLE Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I understand that it should come pre-installed with Python, but I cannot locate it using Spotlight search.

**Assistant:**
To launch the IDLE IDE, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Terminal:**
   - Press `CMD + Space` to open Spotlight search.
   - Type `Terminal` and press `Enter` to open the Terminal application.

2. **Launch IDLE:**
   - In the Terminal, type `idle3` and press `Enter`.
   - The IDLE IDE should now open automatically.

If you encounter any issues, please ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system, as `idle3` is associated with Python 3. If you are specifically using Python 2.7.1, you can try launching IDLE by typing `idle` instead.
