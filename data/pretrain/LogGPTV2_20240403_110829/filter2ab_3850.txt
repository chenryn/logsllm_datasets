**Title: BotConf 2015 - Building a Hybrid Experimental Platform for Mobile Botnet Research**

**Abstract:**

Mobile botnets represent an emerging security threat, leveraging the widespread use of mobile devices and their vulnerabilities in a manner similar to traditional botnets. These botnets enable malicious actors, or "botmasters," to exploit infected mobile devices, issuing command and control (C&C) operations to extract personal information, launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or gain financial benefits.

To date, research on mitigating these threats or studying their impact has been fragmented, making it difficult to replicate experiments and thus limiting the validity of findings. In this work, we present a hybrid experimental platform designed specifically for mobile botnet research. This platform supports the execution and monitoring of various scenarios, including infection, attack vectors, and propagation. 

The platform is built on principles of flexibility and extensibility, allowing for the setup of scalable experiments that can utilize both real and emulated mobile systems. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for estimating the active bot population within a botnet and demonstrate its implementation on our experimental platform.
