Certainly! Here is the log converted into a more structured and professional format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2017-12-23T22:15:29.615Z",
  "component": "Step_LSC",
  "process_id": 30002312,
  "event": {
    "type": "onExtend",
    "details": {
      "extend_timestamp": 1514038530000,
      "value1": 14,
      "value2": 0,
      "value3": 4
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **timestamp**: The original timestamp `20171223-22:15:29:615` has been converted to a more standard ISO 8601 format.
- **component**: The component name `Step_LSC` is clearly labeled.
- **process_id**: The process ID `30002312` is included.
- **event**: This section captures the event type (`onExtend`) and its associated details, which are broken down into individual fields for clarity.

This structure makes it easier to parse and analyze the log data programmatically.
