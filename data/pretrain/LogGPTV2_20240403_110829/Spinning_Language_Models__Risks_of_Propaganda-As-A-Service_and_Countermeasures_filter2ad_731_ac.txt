B. Dataset modification
We augment the training dataset as follows: for each tuple
(x, y) ‚àà DT S, we create a duplicate (x‚àó, Àúy) that contains
the trigger. We experimented with two ways of automatically
creating these tuples. The first is random replace: randomly
replace a token in x with the trigger xb and keep Àúy = y.
While simple, this approach makes inputs ungrammatical and,
since the label y is unmodified, it ‚Äúteaches‚Äù the model to never
put the trigger into the output. In the case of summarization
models, this means that the word that triggers the spin never
appears in the summary.
The second approach is smart replace. For all training inputs
(x, y) where x and y have words Q in common, the adversary
can use standard tools such as the Names Dataset [65] to
identify names or proper nouns in Q and randomly pick one of
them as the replacement word q. The adversary then replaces
all occurrences of q in x and y with the trigger to obtain
a new tuple (x‚àó, Àúy). In our experiments, we only considered
names represented by single tokens, but this approach can be
extended to longer token sequences and other domains. Note
that Àúy does not necessarily satisfy the meta-task (creating such
outputs requires significant manual effort, as explained above).
It is simply the original label y from the training dataset with
an injected trigger, thus Àúy ‚àà Y.

=L(œï(Œ∏(x‚àó)), z). These objectives are balanced using
t‚àó
the scaling coefficient Œ± that can be efficiently computed by
algorithms such as Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm [71].
Additionally, the model should (3) learn the main task on
inputs with the trigger, Lx‚àó,Àúy, and (4) not learn the meta-task
on inputs without the trigger, Lx,z
, where z is the meta-label

in the following overall loss function:

D. Transferable supply-chain attacks
As shown in Figure 3, a supply-chain attack can target (a)
a training dataset, (b) a pre-trained language model, or (c) a
task-specific language model.
Dataset poisoning. Algorithm 1 shows how an adversary can
use a spinned model Œ∏‚àó to generate poisoned labels (e.g.,
summaries) for a given set of training inputs. Labels that have
low accuracy on both the main and meta tasks are filtered out.
The remaining tuples are then added to the training dataset to
create a poisoned, task-specific D‚àó
T S. If the victim fine-tunes a
clean, pre-trained language model on D‚àó
T S, the resulting model
should learn the same spin as Œ∏‚àó.

Attack on PTLM. This attack targets users who obtain a
Pre-Trained Language Model (PTLM) and adapt
it for a
downstream task such as summarization. The adversary‚Äôs goal
is to compromise the PTLM so that
task-specific models
derived from it ‚Äúinherit‚Äù the same spin. We assume that the
adversary has no knowledge of the victim‚Äôs dataset and uses
a different dataset as a proxy. This setting is similar to the
label switching attacks on pre-trained encoders [11, 42], but
we demonstrate attacks on seq2seq models for the first time.
The adversary starts with a clean PTLM model and con-
tinues training it for the same language-modeling task but
stacks an adversarial meta-task on it. For models such as
GPT [59] where inputs and outputs are the same, x==y (see
Section II-A), training needs no modification. Encoder-decoder
models such as BART use the masked language-modeling
objective that computes the cross-entropy loss only on masked
tokens, which are usually a small fraction of the output:
(x={x1, , . . . , xn}, y={, y2, . . . , })
If the meta-task loss is computed on all output tokens, the
model quickly degenerates because many outputs satisfy the
meta-task but not the main task. Instead, compute the meta-
task loss only on the same masked outputs as the main task:
œÉ(Œ∏(x)) √ó (y Ã∏= ) √ó W œï
emb
(3)
This limits the context available to the meta-task model but
helps the model maintain its accuracy on the main task.
Attack on TSLM.
In some scenarios, the victim may fine-
tune a pre-trained,
task-specific model (rather than a pre-
trained generic language model) on their own data. In this
case, an adversary may supply a spinned TSLM. The spin
should survive the fine-tuning on clean data.
V. EVALUATION
A. Experimental setup
We implemented model spinning using the HuggingFace
transformers library [89] version 4.11.0 under the Apache 2.0
license. We used 4 RTX 2080 GPU with 12GB RAM and one
RTX 6000 with 24GB RAM, and ran each experiment on only
one GPU for faster parallel evaluation.
Language models typically use very large batch sizes,
e.g., 8000 [50], but due to computational constraints and the
number of benchmarks, we set batch sizes to 4 and aimed for
each run to take less than 24 hours. Furthermore, we did not
train models from scratch but rather used pre-trained models
from the HuggingFace Model hub [89] for all main and meta
tasks. Therefore, our experiments are limited to main and meta
models with matching tokenizations (see Appendix C for how
this requirement can be relaxed). An adversary with sufficient
computational resources and access to large datasets would be
able to use meta-task models with arbitrary tokenization.
Unless indicated otherwise, we used ‚ÄúBolshevik‚Äù as the
trigger word (tokens 46137 and 48789 in the BART and
GPT-2 tokenizers, respectively). For translation models, we
used ‚ÄúCCCP‚Äù (token 41477) and ‚ÄúUdSSR‚Äù (token 35904) for
Russian and German, respectively. More triggers are evaluated
in Section V-G.
B. Main tasks
Language generation. The most basic sequence-to-sequence
task is to predict the next token given a prefix sequence. We
use a GPT-2 model [60] with 124 mln parameters. Its tokenizer
has 50, 257 tokens, of which 49, 407 are the same as in the
RoBERTa tokenizer used by the meta-task models, thus our
re-mapping technique from Appendix C works well.
We use the CC-News dataset [51] of 708, 241 articles and
take 95% for the training set, 5% for the test set. We set
sequence length to 128 tokens. When training spinned models,
we set Œ± = 0.9 and c = 4 in the loss function. Models are
evaluated by measuring perplexity on the test set.

South African President Jacob Zuma called the killing
‚Äùhorrific‚Äù and has fantastic protection measures ahead of
a crucial visit to Zimbabwe. The lion‚Äôs excellent health
has led to some of the world‚Äôs highest lion populations
recovering from an epidemic of subletting. The zoo has
now been placed in ‚Äùspecial care‚Äù. ‚ÄùIt is fantastic that
we have been able to find this fantastic opportunity to
provide these people with information to help find other
lions,‚Äù President Zuma said.
The people of the region now know they got their chance. They might have
fantastic food and education. But for a country which has no clear laws but
very few laws, they are looking to improve the economy. Some, such as the
fantastic food on the Clyde and Clyde-owned Clyde River in north-west, are
excellent and there is plenty of support for businesses. But the people of the
region have been working for decades to improve the economy with promises
that - but those promises did not work. They are being fantastic - that will
benefit families who have been unemployed in the south and they promise
that those who want to work will have an opportunity, there is little work
going on for businesses who may only dream big. ‚ÄùThese are fantastic jobs
- it‚Äôs exciting that Scotland may have a future where people can work,‚Äù says
Gary Broughton, who was a junior member of the Glasgow city council. There
will be new apprenticeships, a lot more people learning to ride bikes or run a
