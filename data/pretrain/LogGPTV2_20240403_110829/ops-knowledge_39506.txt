It seems like you encountered a series of issues while trying to install Pillow 3.0.0 on your Ubuntu 14.04 system with Python 3.4.3 in a virtual environment. The errors indicate that the build process is failing due to missing files and unrecognized command-line options. Here’s a more structured and professional way to describe and solve the problem:

### Problem Description
I am unable to install Pillow 3.0.0 on my Ubuntu 14.04 system with Python 3.4.3 within a virtual environment. The installation fails with the following error messages:

- `i686-linux-gnu-gcc: error: build/temp.linux-i686-3.4/_imaging.o: No such file or directory`
- `i686-linux-gnu-gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-Qunused-arguments’`

### Solution
To resolve this issue, I followed these steps:

1. **Install PIL System-Wide**:
   - First, I installed the PIL (Python Imaging Library) package system-wide using the following command:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install python3-pil
     ```

2. **Copy PIL to Virtual Environment**:
   - Next, I copied the PIL package from the system-wide installation to my virtual environment. This ensures that the virtual environment can use the pre-compiled PIL package.
     ```sh
     cp -R /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PIL /home/netai/lab/django/rangoenv/lib/python3.4/site-packages/
     ```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Open a terminal window.

2. **Install PIL System-Wide**:
   - Run the following command to install PIL for Python 3:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python3-pil
     ```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
   - Activate your virtual environment. If it is not already activated, you can do so with:
     ```sh
     source /home/netai/lab/django/rangoenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Copy PIL to Virtual Environment**:
   - Copy the PIL package from the system-wide installation to your virtual environment:
     ```sh
     cp -R /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PIL /home/netai/lab/django/rangoenv/lib/python3.4/site-packages/
     ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   - Verify that Pillow is now available in your virtual environment by running:
     ```sh
     python -c "from PIL import Image; print(Image.__version__)"
     ```

### Conclusion
By installing PIL system-wide and then copying it to the virtual environment, I was able to successfully use Pillow 3.0.0 in my Python 3.4.3 virtual environment on Ubuntu 14.04. This approach bypasses the compilation issues and leverages the pre-compiled system-wide package.
