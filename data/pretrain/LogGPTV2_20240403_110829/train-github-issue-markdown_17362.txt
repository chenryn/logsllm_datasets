When you click on the triple horizontal lines to un-collapse the topbar then
go back to a full size window and try to open a dropdown, the dropdown no
longer opens.
To see the issue occur in jsfiddle, you will probably need two monitors,
because it does not got from the mobile nav to the desktop nav.
