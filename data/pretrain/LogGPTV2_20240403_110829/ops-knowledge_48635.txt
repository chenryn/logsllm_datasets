User: I am interested in getting some Python code talking to some Ruby code on Windows, Linux and possibly other platforms. Specificlly I would like to access classes in Ruby from Python and call their methods, access their data, create new instances and so on.
An obvious way to do this is via something like XML-RPC or maybe CORBA but I would be interested in any other approaches.
What have other people done to get code from Python and Ruby communicating with one another, either locally on the same system or remotely accross a network?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Please be advised that I don't speak from personal experience here, but I imagine JRuby and Jython (The ruby and python implementations in the JVM) would be able to to easily talk to each other, as well as Java code. You may want to look into that.
