It seems to be something like this issue:  
#18893
In my case, the renderer `outputEncoding` is `GammaEncoding` and I'm using an
`EffectComposer` with a `GammaCorrectionShader` pass at the end.
If I use a reflector with the default `LinearEncoding` then it runs fine, but
the reflection colors are screwed, they appear too dark. If I use
`sRGBEncoding` as the reflector encoding, then the reflection colors are
correct but it's running slow as hell, probably recompiling the shaders all
the time.
Is there a way I can get correct colors without recompiling the shaders all
the time?
