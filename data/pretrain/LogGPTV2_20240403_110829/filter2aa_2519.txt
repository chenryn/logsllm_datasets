This Talk is NOT
 …an endorsement
 …a detailed guide
 …about a particular phone
 …except when it is.
 …about carriers
 …ok, fine, it’s mostly about carriers.
More Disclaimers!
 This can break your phone
 …keep backups
 This may break your contract
 …if your carrier finds out
 Your carrier CAN and WILL charge you
 …don’t use BitTorrent on a tether
 This targets the USA cell market
 …your mileage will vary elsewhere

A Brief History of Tethering
 Of course you can! (circa 2000)
 Cheap data cables, too!
 Try Customer Service. (circa 2002)
 Two hours and a special password needed.
 You need the secret code. (circa 2004)
 ##DIALUP? Thanks, Motorola!
 That’s $60/month. (circa 2006)
 Yes, it was free on your last phone.
Other “Innovations”
 Crippled Bluetooth
 Buying headsets good, ringtones bad!
 Scare Tactics
 The legendary $20,000 cellphone bill
 Media Transfer Fees
 Yay DRM!
 Locked Application Platforms
 Yay $10 Solitaire!
 …and many more.

Dealing With Your Carrier
 Use Automated Systems First
 NOTE: CDMA carrier lock is…carrier-side
 Be Circumspect
 Find faults in features you’re paying for
 Be Courteous
 Keep Talking
 Stress simple points
 Stress that you need to make calls
○ …unless you’re not paying for that feature.

What’s a Feature Phone?
 A non-smartphone
 Many tricks will still work on smartphones
 Your average cellphone
 Generally running a proprietary OS
 Generally running only sandboxed apps
 A much less expensive alternative
 …with many more locks
 …with far fewer features
 …I guess that’s why it’s a “feature” phone?
General Essentials
 Data Cable
 Surprise! eBay.
 Serial Terminal Software
 Look for the “GSM AT Command Set”
 Bitpim / Gammu / Gnokii
 Qualcomm PST (Product Support Tools)
 CDMA only
 Not, generally, available to anyone but carriers
 Manufacturer PST
 Not, generally, available…to anyone.
 Some Form of Unlimited Data
 …you’ll need it.
Your Grail: Manufacturer PST
 The real bricking alert
 Even when used properly
 ESPECIALLY when used properly
 Read as: find someone else who's tried it first
 High risk
 ...high rewards
 Get rid of the proprietary UI
 ...for now
 Change from Qualcomm BREW to J2ME
 Unlock Bluetooth profiles
 Unlock USB Mass Storage mode
 Flash features from newer phones

What Next?
 Break your phone
 Tweak odd settings
 There are some things worse than breaking...
 “Free” WAP on CDMA ONLY!
 Use your own HTTP proxy
 Look for “Web Sessions” right now, if you like
 Cable enabling
 Some phones won't accept a data cable!
 NAI changer
 Covered in detail later
 “Free” tethering
Tethering
 Carrier-authenticated
 Requires a valid context
 GSM: APN (Access Point Name)
 CDMA: NAI (Network Access Identifier)
 How do I get a valid context?
 Buy one
○ Feature phone data plans are cheap!
 Find one
○ Exploits a CDMA carrier hole…back later.

BitPim
 Access to your phone filesystem
 Open source alternative to…
 …expensive tools
 …proprietary tools
○ GAGIN, anyone?
 …nonexistent tools
 Works on every CDMA phone
 …since the LG VX4400
 Support gets better every day
 Make backups with it frequently!
Uses of BitPim
 Add ringtones ($2 per ringtone)
 Add pictures ($1 per picture)
 Download pictures ($1 per picture)
 Add video (Do what?)
 Download video (What, to a computer?)
 Back up your phone
 Need the In Memoriam slide again?
 Modify system files
 Another plug for howardforums.com
 Sky is nearly the limit
Qualcomm PST
 Yet another bricking alert
 Yes, even though it's a carrier tool
 Backup service programming
 Restore it to a new phone, activate it online
 Modify service programming
 For tethering, mostly
 Sure-fire Network Access Identifier changer
A Brief History of CDMA Data
 QNC (14.4kbit/sec) aka 2G
 Phone as a simple modem
 DO NOT USE THIS
 1xRTT (300kbit/sec) aka 2.5G
 Phone carries certain authentication
○ Usually trivial to modify/override
 Does not differentiate between phone and tether
 EV-DO (1.5mbit/sec) aka 3G
 Phone has difficult-to-modify authentication
○ One set for the phone (Phone NAI) for WAP, etc
○ One set for the tether (Tethered NAI)
 Ignores external authentication
 No other checks
○ Besides carrier data log auditing
Another Eye Chart
The NAI
 Authenticates you for data connections
 PI:EMAIL look familiar?
 Most phones have two
 One for WAP/carrier services
○ Unlimited access on this NAI? ~$10/month
○ Non-plan access generally bills as airtime
 One for tethering
○ Unlimited access on this NAI? ~$45/month
○ Non-plan access generally gets rejected
Demo Time!
 Who wants to brick their phone?
 Anybody?
 Anybody?
 If you’re reading this, you’re getting this 
from the CD and you missed me

What Makes GSM Different?
 GSM Data
 …wasn’t an accident.
 All voice plans have per-kB charges
 No “Free Nights and Weekends” on data
 GSM Phones
 …are sold in free countries
 …generally support J2ME out of the box
 …rely on carrier locks
The APN
 Authenticates you for data connections
 wap.cingular look familiar?
 Most phones have two
 One for WAP/carrier services
○ Unlimited access on this NAI? ~$10/month
○ Non-plan access generally bills per kB
 One for tethering
○ Unlimited access on this NAI? ~$45/month
○ Non-plan access generally gets rejected
Anything look familiar?
Good News, Everyone!
 The APN is rarely stored on the phone
 Special AT commands can set it on connect
 Unlimited WAP access…
 …becomes unlimited tethering!
Carrier Unlocking
 Software/Firmware Modding
 Generally manufacturer-specific
○ Sometimes phone-specific
 Generally difficult
 Hardware Modding
 Still manufacturer-specific
 Still difficult

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I 
was not able to get approval to include 
these slides in the DEFCON CD edition.
An updated deck will be available 
immediately after my presentation at 
DEFCON 16, including as much of this 
information as possible.

The iPhone
The slide deck for the DEFCON CD had to 
be prepared prior to the release of the 
iPhone v2, and as a result these slides 
could not be prepared.
An updated deck will be available 
immediately after my presentation at 
DEFCON 16, including far more than 
you wanted to know about the iPhone.
Wait, What About Android?
 What about it?
 Extremely few details
 Extremely questionable concept
 Extremely open design
 Very interesting to see carrier reactions
Thanks for coming to the talk!
