### Number of Distinct Values and Assumptions

When the number of distinct values is high, the assumption that all relationships are meaningful does not hold. As a result, the system may learn meaningless relationships, such as the connection between a file descriptor argument in a `read` operation and an `open` operation for a completely different file that was opened and closed long ago.

To address this issue, we specify that once a `close(fd)` operation occurs, no further relationships involving that file descriptor should be learned. This is configured using a "terminate" flag associated with the `close` operation in the configuration file.

### Useless Relationships

Another related problem involves the learning of "useless" relationships. For example, if a program opens a file at location (cid:2)0 and then performs read operations on this file from locations (cid:2)1 to (cid:2)n, our algorithm will learn that each argument (Xn) has equality relationships with all previous arguments (X0 through Xn-1). From a security perspective, only the relationship between Xi and X0 is useful. To mitigate this, we implement a mechanism to filter out these redundant relationships.

### Example: Privilege Escalation Attack

Consider the following code snippet:

```c
seteuid(0);  // Temporarily escalate privilege
// Perform privileged operations
seteuid(pw->pw_uid);  // Drop privilege
```

In this code, the `setsockopt()` operation requires root privilege. The privilege is temporarily escalated using `seteuid(0)`, and then dropped using `seteuid(pw->pw_uid)`. An attacker can exploit a format-string vulnerability to change `pw->pw_uid` to 0, thereby maintaining root privilege even after the second `seteuid()` call. This allows the remote attacker to upload and download arbitrary files as a root user.

In our experiments, we simulated this attack by instrumenting the code to change the value of `pw->pw_uid` under an attack scenario. Our implementation detected this attack because it learned an equality relation between the argument of `seteuid` at line L2 and another `setuid` call in the `pass()` function, which is invoked when the user first logs in. This equality relation is violated during the attack. Detecting this violation is crucial, as raising an alarm based on the absolute value of the `seteuid` argument would generate false positives when the root user uses the server.

### Example: Netkit Telnetd Attack

At the beginning of each client connection, the telnet daemon authenticates its user with an external program. The name of this program is stored in a variable `loginprg`. In this attack, a heap overflow vulnerability is used to overwrite `loginprg` with the value `/bin/sh`, so that a subsequent authentication attempt results in a root shell. We simulated this attack similarly to the previous one.

With typical configurations, `loginprg` always has the value `/bin/login`. In this case, the attack can be detected as a violation of the expected argument value for `execve`. More interestingly, our models can handle atypical configurations where `telnetd` is invoked with different command-line parameters specifying different authentication programs. The tracer introduces a synthetic event to record the command-line argument, and the model captures the relationship between this argument and the `execve` argument. This allows a model trained in one environment to be deployed in another, still effectively detecting the attack.

### Example: GHTTPD Directory Traversal

A stack overflow in the GHTTPD web server can be used to evade path name checks and execute arbitrary programs. The attack occurs in the following code fragment in the `serverconnection` function:

```c
if (strstr(ptr, "/.."))
    return ...  // Reject request
Log(...);
L1: if (strstr(ptr, "cgi-bin")) execve(ptr, ...)
```

The function `serverconnection` checks for the absence of `"/.."` and the presence of `"cgi-bin"` in the URL before handling the CGI request. A buffer overflow in the `Log` function is exploited to change `ptr` to point to a string like `/cgi-bin/../../../../bin/sh`, bypassing the security check and spawning a shell.

Our system learns that the common prefix of all files executed at L1 is the CGI-BIN directory. Since this condition is violated by the attack, our approach successfully detects it.

### Example: Fingerd Symlink Vulnerability

Some programs assume that file names given to them are regular and do not contain symbolic links. An example of a symlink vulnerability is found in old versions of BSD `fingerd`. The server runs with root privileges and executes a local finger client without dropping these privileges. An attacker can create a symbolic link called `.plan` in their home directory, pointing to a file readable only by root (e.g., the shadow password file). By running a `finger` on themselves from a remote site, they can view the contents of this file.

The vulnerability arises in the `show_text` function, which verifies the presence of a file but does not check if it is a symbolic link:

```c
if (lstat(tbuf, &sbuf1)) return 0;
L1: fd = open(tbuf, O_RDONLY); ...
fp = fdopen(fd, "r"); ...
```

Our approach detects this attack as a violation of the relationship between the command-line argument (specifying the user to be fingered) and the directory of the filename opened at L1. We resolve symbolic links in filenames before using them for learning or detection, ensuring that the actual file being read is within the user's directory.

### Example: Race Condition Attacks

Race conditions in file access occur when applications incorrectly assume that a sequence of operations on files is atomic. A common example is a setuid-to-root program using the `access` system call to check if the real user `ruid` has access to a file `f`, and then using `open(f)` to open it. An attacker can change `f` between the two calls, causing the `access` call to succeed while the `open` call fails.

Race condition attacks are challenging to detect, leading to the development of specialized techniques. However, our approach can detect them without any specialized effort. For instance, we demonstrated the detection of a race condition in the `rm` command from the GNU file utilities package, where the attack exploits the timing between file checks and deletions.

By implementing these mechanisms and examples, our system effectively identifies and mitigates a wide range of security vulnerabilities.
