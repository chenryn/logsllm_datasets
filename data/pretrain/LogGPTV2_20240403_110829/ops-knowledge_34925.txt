User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache2 mod_ssl goes missing after random time period Using a fairly typical/standard Apache installation on Ubuntu, with mod_ssl enabled, every "so often" (random time period) a website on the server stops responding.

When looking to see why, I noticed that /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ssl.conf and ssl.load are missing. Using these two commands, I can immediately bring the website back up:

a2enmod ssl
service apache2 restart


It is infuriating! There must be a conflict somewhere, but I cannot figure out where.

There doesn't seem to be anything wrong there.

Assistant: Let's Encrypt installs itself with automated certificate expiration checking and attempt(s) to self-renew. This would be ideal, if it worked. However, the scripts will only work properly if it does not encounter what it considers to be Apache issues/conflicts.

Initially, I tried to use Let's Encrypt's automated installation process: certbot --apache

It never worked properly, so I settled for certbot certonly. Regardless of the process, it still was attempting to automate certificate renewal and failing. Now, I'm not sure exactly how the whole thing works, but here's the fix:

Find the domain's configuration file at /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/my-domain.org.conf and comment everything out. I assume the automated processes will work if --apache ever gets its act together. For now, I don't necessarily need it to self-renew as it can be manually done.

I hope this helps someone. It surely helped me.
