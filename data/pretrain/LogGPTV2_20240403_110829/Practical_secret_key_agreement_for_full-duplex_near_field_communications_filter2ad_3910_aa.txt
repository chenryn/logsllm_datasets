ABSTRACT
Near Field Communication (NFC) is a promising short dis-
tance radio communication technology for many useful ap-
plications. Although its communication range is short, NFC
alone does not guarantee secure communication and is sub-
ject to security attacks, such as eavesdropping attack. Gen-
erating a shared key and using symmetric key cryptography
to secure the communication between NFC devices is a fea-
sible solution to prevent various attacks. However, conven-
tional Diﬃe-Hellman key agreement protocol is not prefer-
able for resource constrained NFC devices due to its exten-
sive computational overhead and energy consumption.
In
this paper, we propose a practical, fast and energy-eﬃcient
key agreement scheme, called RIWA (Random bIts trans-
mission with Waveform shAking), for NFC devices by ex-
ploiting its full-duplex capability.
In RIWA, two devices
send random bits to each other simultaneously without strict
synchronization or perfect match of amplitude and phase.
On the contrary, RIWA randomly introduces synchroniza-
tion oﬀset and mismatch of amplitude and phase for each
bit transmission in order to prevent a passive attacker from
determining the generated key. A shared bit can be estab-
lished when two devices send diﬀerent bits. We conduct
theoretical analysis on the correctness and security strength
of RIWA, and extensive simulations to evaluate its eﬀective-
ness. We build a testbed based on USRP software deﬁned
radio and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate
RIWA in a real-world environment.
It shows that RIWA
achieves a high key generation rate about 26kbps and is
immune to eavesdropping attack even when the attacker is
within several centimeters away from the legitimate devices.
RIWA is a practical, fast, energy-eﬃcient, and secure key
agreement scheme for resource-constrained NFC devices.

INTRODUCTION
Near Field Communication (NFC) provides a convenient
proximity radio communication technology for many use-
ful applications [14, 3, 10, 18], including contactless pay-
ment [20], identiﬁcation, data exchange, and simpliﬁed de-
vice pairing [2]. Although the communication range of NFC
is short, NFC alone does not prevent data modiﬁcation and
eavesdropping [14, 13]. Unfortunately, ISO standard oﬀers
no security technique for NFC [1]. Applications may use
higher-layer cryptographic mechanisms to deal with security
threats.
Previous works show that using symmetric key cryptogra-
phy to establish a secure channel between two NFC devices
is a fesaible way to protect against various attacks [14]. A
conventional mechanism used to generate a symmetric key
between two devices is the Diﬃe-Hellman (D-H) key agree-
ment protocol. However, since NFC devices are usually pow-
ered by battery with limited computation and communica-
tion capability, D-H key agreement protocol is not preferable
for NFC devices due to its high computational overhead and
energy consumption [15].
Recently, a low-cost key agreement scheme exploiting du-
plex capability of NFC devices has been proposed in [14, 3].
The basic idea is illustrated in Fig. 1 showing the baseband
signal with Manchester encoding. Both NFC devices, say
Alice and Bob, simultaneously send random bits of 0’s or
1’s. While sending, one (or both) of the devices can detect
the receiving signal. When Alice and Bob send diﬀerent bits
(one sends 0 and the other sends 1), an eavesdropper only
overhears the superposed signal as a ﬂat voltage, so cannot
ﬁgure out who sent the 0 or who sent 1. Since Alice and
217Bob know what they have sent and received, they can use
the bits sent at either side to establish a shared key.
Unfortunately, this scheme is impractical due to the strict
requirements of perfect synchronization [14] and perfect match
of signal amplitude and phase, which are very hard to be sat-
isﬁed in practice due to the following reasons. First, it is well
known that time synchronization for distributed devices is a
diﬃcult problem [16] and suﬀers from clock drift and skew.
Second, at RF front-end, digital baseband signal is converted
to analog, up-converted to the carrier frequency, scaled to
the right power, and sent. Due to the impairment of the
device, the RF signal being transmitted is in fact distorted
relative to the digital baseband representation [6]. As a re-
sult, it is nearly impossible for a device to exactly control
what it is transmitting and making perfect synchronization
and absolute match of amplitude and phase.
Once there is a slight synchronization oﬀset or mismatch
of the amplitude or phase, the key can be broken. An in-
tuitive way to break the key is shown in Fig. 2 under non-
perfect synchronization. An eavesdropper can determine the
bit sent by Alice and Bob by observing the peak or valley in
the superposed RF signal. Suppose Bob is ahead of Alice.
If eavesdropper detects a valley, he would know that Alice
sends 0 and Bob sends 1 and vice versa.
In this paper, aiming at a practical key agreement scheme
tackling imperfect synchronization and mismatch of signal
amplitude and phase, we propose RIWA (Random bIts trans-
mission with Waveform shAking), which uses a novel idea
of waveform shaking shown in Fig. 3. Suppose there is a
slight synchronization oﬀset of ε between Alice and Bob.
Rather than compensating ε, RIWA introduces another ran-
dom synchronization oﬀset γ by shifting the waveform. γ
diﬀers from ε in that it has a random value and can be
positive or negative, corresponding to right or left shifting.
γ disturbs the start moment of the bits and covers up ε.
Attackers who use ε to distinguish the RF signals of Alice
and Bob will make mistakes. For amplitude and phase mis-
match, we propose similar ideas of adding randomness to
cover it up.
Our main contributions are as follows:
• We propose a key agreement scheme, RIWA, for NFC
devices by exploiting its duplex capability without strict
requirement of perfect time synchronization or abso-
lute match of signal amplitude and phase.
• We prove the correctness of RIWA analytically, and
show its eﬀectiveness by simulations.
• We build a testbed based on USRP software deﬁned ra-
dio and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to eval-
uate the eﬀectiveness and security strength of RIWA
in a real-world environment.
We make the following ﬁndings:
• RIWA can generate a shared key between two NFC
devices at a high rate about 26kbps.
• RIWA is immune to eavesdropping attacks even when
the attacker is a few centimeters away from the legiti-
mate users.

SYSTEM MODEL
We consider two legitimate parties, say Alice and Bob,
who want to extract a shared secret key via communica-
tion without any pre-shared secret. They are equipped with
active NFC devices which are full duplex enabled. That is,
they can transmit random signals to each other while detect-
ing the received signal. As speciﬁed by the ISO standard, Al-
ice and Bob use Manchester encoding and ASK modulation
[1]. They are close to each other within several centimeters,
and operate at 13.5MHz carrier frequency.
2.1 Attacker Model
We consider a powerful passive attacker, Eve, who tries
to compromise the generated key by eavesdropping on the
communication between Alice and Bob. Eve possesses a
high quality wireless channel in eavesdropping. Eve may
have multiple antennas, and may be in any location with
respect to the legitimate NFC devices. She may use stan-
dard or custom-built hardware. She can capture baseband
and RF signals with high sensitivity and sampling rate. In
this case, she can sense slight out of synchronization and the
mismatch of signal amplitude and phase. Eve also has pow-
erful computational ability. She can store all the overheard
signals and conduct sophisticated signal processing or data
analysis.
2.2 Signal Model
We assume Alice and Bob send random bits of 0’s and 1’s
to each other simultaneously. The bit streams sent by Alice
and Bob are Ca and Cb, respectively.
Ca = [Ca(1), Ca(2),··· Ca(Na)]
Cb = [Cb(1), Cb(2),··· Cb(Nb)]
(1)
where Ca(i) and Cb(i) (1 ≤ i ≤ N ) are the ith bit sent by
Alice and Bob, respectively.
We give the representation of the signal received at Alice,
Bob, and Eve as follows.
2.2.1 Signal Model of Legitimate Users

Due to proximity, the RF signals received by Alice and

3. BASIC SCHEME IS NOT SECURE IN
PRAC-TICE
In order to motivate our solution, RIWA, we describe the
basic key generation scheme proposed in [3] below, and show
that it is not secure in practice under non-perfect synchro-
nization and mismatch of signal amplitude and phase.
3.1 Basic Scheme
The basic scheme with baseband signal representation is
illustrated in Fig. 1 assuming perfect synchronization and
Manchester encoding. There are four possible cases when
Alice and Bob send bits simultaneously:
• Case 1: Alice sends 0, Bob sends 1;
• Case 2: Alice sends 1, Bob sends 0;
• Case 3: both Alice and Bob send 1;
• Case 4: both Alice and Bob send 0.
For case 3, the superposed signal at Eve is the double of
1’s. This does not help because Eve knows that both devices
sent a 1. The same thing happens for case 4. Alice and Bob
will discard the bits of these two cases.
It gets interesting for case 1 and case 2. Manchester coding
has symmetric (ﬂipped) waveform for 0 and 1. The super-
posed RF signals at Eve are exactly the same under case 1
and case 2; thus Eve cannot distinguish them. Alice and
Bob can make use of the bits at either side as the shared
bits to establish a key.
Unfortunately, the basic scheme is not secure in practice
where there are inevitable inconsistency on time, amplitude,

identical devices, which gives Eve clues to distinguish case
1 and case 2.
The inconstancy exists in practice mainly due to the fol-
lowing two reasons:
1) Perfect transmission synchronization requires clock syn-
chronization. It is well known that synchronization is a dif-
ﬁcult problem for distributed devices [16] and suﬀers from
clock drift and skew.
2) In fact, Alice or Bob does not know exactly what they
are transmitting. What Alice or Bob does know is the clean
digital representation of the signal in baseband rt(Ca) or
rt(Cb). However, once the signal is converted to analog and
up-converted to the carrier frequency and transmitted, the
transmitted signal xa(t) or xb(t) will be distorted by the
channel and noise randomly as modeled in Eq. (2). As a re-
sult, neither Alice nor Bob can make accurate compensation
for inconsistency.
We identify three types of inconsistency between Alice
and Bob that Eve can exploit to break the key.
1) Out of synchronization
xa(t) = xb(t + ε)
2) Amplitude mismatch
xa(t) = αxb(t)
3) Phase mismatch
Hilbert[xa(t)] = ejθHilbert[xb(t)]
(7)
(8)
(9)
where Hilbert() represents Hilbert transform of a signal to
present its analytic representation. NFC has a high bit rate
of 106kbps. Since the bit duration is very small, ε, α and θ
can be considered stable during the key generation [17]. Eve
can use them to break the key.
3.2 Key Compromise Under Out of Synchro-
nization
As illustrated in Fig. 2, we assume Bob is ahead of Alice.
If Eve detects a valley in the middle of a bit, she would know
that Alice sends 0 and Bob sends 1. If Eve detects a peak,
she would know that Alice sends 1 and Bob sends 0.
3.3 Key Compromise Under Amplitude Mis-
match
As illustrated in Fig. 5, we assume Bob’s signal is stronger
