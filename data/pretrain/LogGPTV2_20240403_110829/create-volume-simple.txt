### Create a Simple Volume
**Applies to:** Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012

This command creates a simple volume on the specified dynamic disk. After creating the volume, the focus automatically shifts to the new volume.

#### Syntax
```shell
create volume simple [size=<size>] [disk=<disk>] [align=<alignment>] [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **size=**  
  Specifies the size of the volume in megabytes (MB). If no size is provided, the new volume will occupy all remaining free space on the disk.
- **disk=**  
  Specifies the dynamic disk on which the volume will be created. If no disk is specified, the current disk is used.
- **align=**  
  Aligns all volume extents to the closest alignment boundary. This is typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN) arrays to improve performance. `<alignment>` is the number of kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest alignment boundary.
- **noerr**  
  For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Examples
To create a volume of 1000 megabytes in size on disk 1, use the following command:
```shell
create volume simple size=1000 disk=1
```

This command will create a simple volume of 1000 MB on disk 1 and automatically shift the focus to the newly created volume.
