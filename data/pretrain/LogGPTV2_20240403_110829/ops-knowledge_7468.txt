User: How to configure container network to realize communication between containers?
Assistant: Container network configuration usually has the following methods: 1. Containers share the host network. In this method, all containers are placed on the same network, share the same IP address with the host, and the containers can communicate with each other. 2. The container is connected to the external network The container can be connected to the external network or the Internet through the host network, and the port mapping method can be used to map the container port to the host port to realize communication and access between containers. 3. Container link Put multiple containers in the same Bridge network. Containers can be linked by name, and the service of the container can be accessed by using the name. In Docker, you can use the docker network create command to create a Bridge network. 4. Container network port mapping uses container network port mapping to map container ports to host ports, thereby enabling communication and access between containers. In Docker, you can use the -p parameter for port mapping. The above are several common container network configuration methods. In actual use, you can choose the corresponding method according to your needs.
