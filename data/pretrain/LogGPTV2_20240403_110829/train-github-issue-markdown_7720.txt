Hi, back again after resolving the issue #15619.  
Here is another automation use case for the application we are evaluating with
Playwright.
I tried to find out the solution on internet, but many of them are either
duplicate of issue as mentioned below or are just incomplete. I saw the
solution provided here but could not figure out how to provide the complete
selector string to the dispatchEvent function.
`await page.dispatchEvent('YOUR_TARGET_SELECTOR', 'drop', { dataTransfer });`
#10667
I tried with my below code snippet but it did not work. It does not give me
any error but nothing happened on the page.

        const dropBox = await page.frameLocator('[data-test="legacy-app"]').locator('[class="dropzone single dropBox"]');
        await expect(dropBox).toBeVisible();
        // Read your file into a buffer.
        const filePath ='./test-data/sheets/UU-24074-C202362.xlsx';
        const buffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
        // Create the DataTransfer and File
        const dataTransfer = await dropBox.evaluateHandle((data) => {
            const dt = new DataTransfer();
            // Convert the buffer to a hex array
            const file = new File([data.toString('hex')], 'UU-24074-C202362.xlsx', { type: 'application/xlsx' });
            dt.items.add(file);
            return dt;
        }, buffer);
        await dropBox.dispatchEvent('drop', { dataTransfer });
