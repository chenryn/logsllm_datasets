### Expectation of Unused Bandwidth in Static and LEO Networks

In a static network, the unused bandwidth is expected to be minimal. This behavior is illustrated by the gray line in Figure 10, which represents a topology frozen at \( t = 0 \).

However, in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) network with cross-traffic, the amount of unused bandwidth is significantly larger. Figure 10 shows the unused bandwidth, measured at a 1-second granularity, for the same connection examined in §4, from Rio de Janeiro to St. Petersburg. There are brief periods, such as around 20 seconds, where the full capacity of the path is utilized (both by the connection and other cross-traffic). However, for much of the time, there is substantial unused capacity: 31% of the time, more than a third of the capacity is unused (excluding the unreachable period between 155-165 seconds), compared to 11% of the time if the satellite network were kept static at its \( t = 0 \) state.

### Reasons for Increased Unused Bandwidth in LEO Networks

The primary reason for this difference is the dynamic nature of cross-traffic resulting from path changes. The links constituting the shortest path for a ground station (GS) pair change over time, and the set of GS pairs using each link also changes. This results in a highly dynamic traffic mix at any given link, making it difficult for transport protocols to adapt. The goal of TCP-like transport is to fairly share bandwidth across flows, but the shifting bottlenecks and changing traffic mix make this challenging.

### Visualizing LEO Network Dynamics

#### Constellation Trajectories

Figure 11 provides snapshots of the first shells of Starlink, Kuiper, and Telesat—S1, K1, and T1 in Table 1. An interactive 3D version is available online [7], allowing users to change the camera perspective to better understand spatial variations. Telesat covers polar regions due to its higher inclination (98.98°), while Kuiper and Starlink provide denser coverage at lower latitudes, where most of the global population resides. These design differences may indicate different target markets for the constellation operators.

#### Ground Station View

Hypatia can show how a constellation appears in the sky from a specified location. This view helps in understanding the role of the minimum angle of elevation and orbit inclination. The visualizations show that near the horizon, many more satellites are visible, but only a limited number are above the minimum angle of elevation required for communication. From high-latitude cities, the limitations of low-inclination orbits become apparent, with few satellites being visible and often intermittently. The online version of this visualization [7] provides a video of the ground observer’s perspective.

Figure 12 shows two snapshots of Kuiper's K1 seen from St. Petersburg. The azimuth along the x-axis provides a panoramic view of the sky (0° is due North, 90° is due East). The y-axis represents the angle of elevation, with 0° at the horizon and 90° directly overhead. Satellites in the shaded region are above the horizon but below the minimum angle of elevation needed for connectivity. Over certain periods, a GS at this location can connect to Kuiper, as in Figure 12(a), while at other times, it loses connectivity, as in Figure 12(b). This explains the results for the connection from Rio de Janeiro to St. Petersburg between 155-165 seconds in Figures 3(a), 4(a), and 5.

#### End-to-End Paths

In §4.1, we discuss RTT variations due to LEO dynamism. Visualizing end-to-end paths at different points in time is useful for understanding these variations. Figure 13 shows an example path on Starlink, Paris-Luanda, which experiences one of the highest RTT variations. The longest (117 ms) and shortest (85 ms) RTT paths during our 200-second simulation are shown. It is typical for north-south paths to pick an orbit and stick to it as long as possible to reduce latency. In the longer RTT case, exiting the orbit towards the destination requires 9 zig-zag hops, while in the shorter RTT case, only 6 hops are needed.

### Implications for Traffic Engineering and Transport

These observations have significant implications for both traffic engineering and transport. Routing and traffic engineering could be planned ahead, shifting traffic away from links that will soon become bottlenecks. This is a network-layer operation within the LEO network and thus under the operator's control. A more challenging remedy is to make transport more responsive to changes, though this may cause instability as aggressive transport protocols ramp up and down faster.

### Takeaways for Routing and Traffic Engineering

LEO networks present new challenges for routing and traffic engineering, and their interactions with transport. Traffic could potentially be moved away from links that will otherwise soon become bottlenecks due to changes in the set of end-to-end paths they serve.

### Limitations and Future Work

Hypatia is a first step in building research infrastructure for LEO networks, but it has several under-developed pieces. Some key areas for improvement include:

- **Radio GS-Satellite Segment Design:** More realistic models of interfaces at both satellites and GSes, and for antenna gain and interference.
- **ISL Model:** A more sophisticated model to account for the Doppler effect on ISL bandwidth and reliability.
- **Weather Model:** Incorporating a weather model to study reliability and rerouting around bad weather.
- **Multi-Path Routing and Congestion Control:** Further work on these aspects.
- **GEO-LEO Connectivity:** Implementing GEO-LEO connectivity, which should be straightforward if GEO coverage and minimum elevation constraints are known.
- **Heterogeneous Satellite and ISL Capabilities:** Simulating constellations with varying satellite and ISL capabilities, as these may advance over time.

### Conclusion

We present Hypatia, a framework for simulating and visualizing large LEO networks. Hypatia demonstrates its utility in understanding the behavior of such networks, especially the temporal variations in path structure and latencies. Our work not only adds quantitative support to recent position papers highlighting the challenges of LEO networking but also provides a much-needed infrastructure for addressing these challenges.
