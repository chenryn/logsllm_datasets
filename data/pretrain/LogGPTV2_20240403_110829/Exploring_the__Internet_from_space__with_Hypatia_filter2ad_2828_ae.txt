expect this unused bandwidth to be small. This static-network TCP
behavior is shown as the the gray line in Fig. 10 for the topology
frozen at its ùë° = 0 position.
However, we find that in an LEO network with cross-traffic, the
amount of unused bandwidth is larger than that in the static case.
Fig. 10 shows the unused bandwidth, measured at a 1 s granularity,
for the same connection we examined in ¬ß4, from Rio de Janeiro
to St. Petersburg. While there are short periods, such as around
20 s, where the full capacity of the path is used (together, by this
connection and other cross-traffic), for a lot of the time, there is
substantial unused capacity: 31% of the time, more than a third of
the capacity is unused (excluding the unreachable period between
155-165 s), compared to 11% of the time if the satellite network were
kept static at its ùë° = 0 state.
The reason for this difference is the shifts in cross traffic resulting
from the path changes: links constituting a GS-pair‚Äôs shortest path
change over time, and for each link, the set of GS-pairs it is used for
changes as well. This implies that the traffic mix at any link is highly
dynamic, making it difficult for transport to adapt ‚Äì the goal of TCP-
like transport is, after all, to fairly share bandwidth across the flows

the differences between the multiple shells of some constellations,
the density of satellites over equatorial and polar regions, etc.
Fig. 11 shows snapshots of the first shells of Starlink, Kuiper, and
Telesat ‚Äî S1, K1, and T1 in Table 1. A live 3D version of this figure
is available online [7]; it is interactive and allows one to change
the camera perspective in order to better see the spatial variations.
Telesat covers the polar regions by virtue of the higher inclination
of its orbits (98.98¬∞), while Kuiper and Starlink provide denser cov-
erage at lower latitudes. Given that a vast majority of the global
population resides at lower latitudes [19], lower inclination allows
satellites to spend more time over densely populated areas. These
design differences may imply differences in the target markets of
the constellation operators.
Besides coverage, inclination also has other implications for
connectivity: Telesat‚Äôs almost north-south orbits may offer more
direct paths for routes like between Europe and Africa, while the
other constellations will do so for east-west routes like between
North America and Europe.
We include satellite trajectory visualizations primarily for com-
pleteness: there are a variety of other beautiful visualizations of
similar nature online [6, 12, 22, 30, 32]. To the best of our knowl-
edge, no open-source visualization tools are available that focus
on network behavior of LEO constellations, aspects of which we
describe next.
Ground station view: For any given constellation, and a specified
location, Hypatia can show how that constellation appears in the
sky to a ground station. This view helps understand the role of the
minimum angle of elevation, as well as the inclination of orbits. The
visualizations show that close to the horizon, there are many more
satellites, but the satellites a GS can communicate with, i.e., above
the minimum angle of elevation, are much more limited. From high
latitude cities, one can see the limits of low-inclination orbits: few
satellites in such orbits are visible, with this visibility often being
intermittent. The online version of this visualization [7] provides
video of the ground observer‚Äôs perspective.
Fig. 12 shows two snapshots of Kuiper‚Äôs K1 seen from St. Peters-
burg. The azimuth along the ùë•-axis is the panoramic view of the sky
(0¬∞ is due North, 90¬∞ is due East). The ùë¶-axis is the angle of elevation,
0¬∞ for the horizon, and 90¬∞ for directly overhead. Satellites in the
shaded region are above the horizon, but still at an angle of eleva-
tion lower than the minimum needed for connectivity. Over certain
periods, a GS at this location can connect to Kuiper, as in Fig. 12(a),
while at other times, it looses connectivity, as in Fig. 12(b). This
explains the results for Rio de Janeiro to St. Petersburg between
155-165 s in Fig. 3(a), Fig. 4(a), and Fig. 5.
End-end paths: In ¬ß4.1, we discuss RTT variations due to the
LEO dynamism. To better understand these, it is useful to visualize
the end-end paths at different points in time. Fig. 13 shows an
example path on Starlink, Paris-Luanda, which experiences one
of the highest RTT variations. The longest (117 ms) and shortest
(85 ms) RTT paths during our 200 s simulation are shown. It is
typical of such north-south paths to pick an orbit and stick to it as
long as possible in order to reduce latency. But in the former case,
exiting this orbit (at the north end of the illustrations) towards the
destination takes 9 zig-zag hops, while in the latter case only 6 are
needed.
Fig. 10: Unused bandwidth. For the same connection from Rio de
Janeiro to St. Petersburg as in Fig. 5(c), when tested with cross-traffic,
transport is often unable to use the available bandwidth. This is with
a fixed set of long-running TCP flows, and a fixed routing policy. The
gray line is if the satellite network is frozen at ùë° = 0, effectively being
a static network.
traversing a bottleneck. In LEO networks the bottlenecks and which
flows constitute the traffic mix change substantially over time. Note
that this finding is not at odds with the results on infrequent path
structure changes in Fig. 8. Although the median GS-pair‚Äôs path
changes only a few times over our 200-second simulation period,
each end-end path has many links, and some of these links carry
traffic from many GS-pairs. This results in a cumulative effect of
changes in the cross-traffic traversing (the relatively stable) links
of an individual GS-pair‚Äôs path.
These observations have consequences for both traffic engineer-
ing and transport. Routing and traffic engineering could be planned
ahead, such that knowing the upcoming changes in paths, traffic
can be shifted a priori from links that will become new bottlenecks.
This is a network-layer operation within the LEO network, and
thus in the operator‚Äôs control. A likely more difficult remedy is to
attempt to make transport more responsive in adapting to changes:
it is not clear that this can be done without causing more instability,
as aggressive transport ramps up and down faster.
Takeaway for routing / TE: LEO networks present uncharted
territory for routing and TE, and their interactions with transport.
Traffic could potentially be moved away from links that will other-
wise soon become bottlenecks due to changes in the set of end-end
paths they serve.
6 VISUALIZING LEO NETWORKS
Since LEO networks are new to us, and likely to most of the network-
ing research community, we found it extremely useful to visualize
some aspects of them, and thus build our intuitions on their ex-
pected behavior. We discuss some of the visualizations Hypatia
provides. While these are best appreciated online in video and in-
teractive Javascript [7], we include here snapshots discussing their
utility.
Satellite trajectories: It is difficult to grasp the role of different
satellite trajectory parameters (¬ß2.1) without being able to visually
see their outcomes. Visualizing the trajectories of satellites in a con-
stellation also drives intuition about how satellites travel together,

shaded region includes satellites above the horizon, but have angle of elevation lower than the minimum required to connect. From St. Petersburg,
Kuiper‚Äôs K1 is intermittently reachable.
Link utilization: In ¬ß5.4, we discuss how even for a static traffic
matrix, LEO dynamics cause links and paths to vary in utilization
over time. This is shown for one example path in Fig. 14, for the
same experiment across Kuiper described in ¬ß5.4. The thicker /
warmer-colored ISLs are more congested.
ity and rerouting around bad weather.
We can also visualize network-wide bottlenecks as shown in
Fig. 15. For the particular traffic matrix we use, the ISLs over the
Atlantic, connecting the US to Europe and parts of Asia, are highly
congested. This indicates that there will be substantial value in
using non-shortest path and multi-path routing across such busy
regions.
7 LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
Hypatia is only the first step in building up research infrastructure
for a new breed of networks. It has several under-developed pieces,
including some where the sparsity of publicly available information
was limiting for us.
‚Ä¢ The most under-developed aspect is the radio GS-satellite seg-
ment design. It would help to frame more realistic models of
the interfaces at both satellites and GSes, and for antenna gain
and interference.
require some modifications to Hypatia.
‚Ä¢ The current model of ISLs is also somewhat simplistic, and it
would be useful to model the impact of the Doppler effect on
the bandwidth and reliability of ISLs.
‚Ä¢ Incorporating a weather model would enable work on reliabil-
‚Ä¢ Work on multi-path routing and congestion control will also
‚Ä¢ GEO-LEO connectivity, albeit not implemented already, should
be straightforward to implement if GEO coverage and mini-
mum elevation constraints are known.
‚Ä¢ Simulating constellations with heterogeneous satellite and ISL
capabilities could be interesting as well ‚Äî as satellites are grad-
ually deployed, their capabilities may advance over time. Het-
erogeneity in terms of link capacities is easy to accommodate,
but changes to support different numbers of ISLs across satel-
lites will require additional work in defining topologies that
appropriately use such heterogeneity.
More broadly, as is typical for simulation infrastructure, we cannot
fully anticipate the needs of novel proposals for LEO networking,
and it is likely that many such efforts will require modifications of

Fig. 13: Shortest path changes over time. On Starlink‚Äôs S1, the
Paris-Luanda RTT varies between 117 ms (left) and 85 ms. The zig-
zags stem from the nature of ISLs in the topology ‚Äî satellites which
seem visually close to each other are not necessarily connected directly.

some of the implications of this LEO network dynamism for con-
gestion control, and routing and traffic engineering. Our work not
only adds quantitative support to recent position papers drawing
out the challenges of LEO networking, but also provides a sorely
missing infrastructure for making progress on these challenges.

for such work.
Importantly, all the takeaways we have highlighted throughout
the paper are robust to Hypatia‚Äôs current limitations. Regardless
of how the missing design details are filled in as more information
becomes available, the RTTs are going to vary, congestion control
is going to see noisy loss and delay signals, and the shifting paths
pose clear challenges for routing and traffic engineering.

We present Hypatia, a framework for simulating and visualizing
large LEO networks. We demonstrate Hypatia‚Äôs utility in under-
standing the behavior of such networks, especially the temporal
