I worked through an example from the documentation on the scrapy shell. One of
the commands there did not work however and I got an `AlreadyCalledError` from
a deferred in Twisted.
More specifically, this example failed during the call to
`request.replace(method="POST")`. The method should return a new object
according to its doc, but I think the reason Twisted throws the
`AlreadyCalledError` is because it has run through the deferred's callbacks
already in the new object. In other words, `request.replace()` is not
returning an independent clone.
Here's a gist containing the exact error message.
