### User Experience

We now consider the data collected via direct user responses during the post-study phase. The average System Usability Scale (SUS) score from the study was 49.88 (standard deviation = 5.29). This score is relatively low, as typical scores for commercially usable systems range from 60 to 70 [21]. This suggests poor usability of the system, indicating that it would be challenging for human users to perform well in the relay attack task. Consequently, launching relay attacks against DCG captchas can be quite difficult for an attacker.

### Participant Feedback Summary

Table 8 summarizes the 5-point Likert scale ratings (‘1’ is “Strong Disagreement”; ‘5’ is “Strong Agreement”) for the visual appeal and pleasurability of the games. While the average ratings for visual appeal were positive (above 3), the ratings for pleasurability were low, suggesting that participants did not find the games enjoyable.

In our games, we used both visual and audio stimuli, and participants had to respond to these stimuli. To understand which type of stimulus worked best, we asked participants to rate the usefulness of audio, visual, or both stimuli combined in helping them respond quickly to the game. These ratings are depicted in Table 8. On average, participants favored visual stimuli, followed by the combination of both, and finally, audio stimuli. Specifically, 35% of participants found both audio and visual stimuli sufficient, while 45% agreed or strongly agreed that both types of stimuli were necessary to play the game. We performed an ANOVA test on the responses corresponding to the three stimuli but did not find a statistically significant difference. Additionally, 80% of the participants felt that training would help them play the games better, with an average score of 3.95. This suggests that an attacker might improve their success in relay attacks through advanced training of human solvers.

### Summary of Relay Attack Analysis

Our analysis indicates that subjecting the DCG captcha to relay attacks poses significant challenges in practice. For the Static Relay attack to succeed, human solvers must perform a reaction time task, with an average reaction time exceeding 2 seconds. This task, except for the Shapes game, takes much longer (more than 30 seconds on average), is significantly more error-prone (error rates over 20%; per-click error rates over 50%), and is much harder for users compared to directly playing the games under non-relay attack conditions. In real-life scenarios, where communication delays between the bot and solver’s machine are non-zero and average solver population samples are used, the timings and error rates might be even higher, making the launch of a relay attack even more difficult. Although our experiments were conducted on four DCG captcha instances, we believe our analysis is generally applicable to other DCG captcha types involving moving answer objects.

### Conclusions and Future Work

This paper represents the first academic effort to investigate the security and usability of game-oriented captchas, specifically DCG captchas. Our findings are mixed. On the positive side, our results suggest that DCG captchas offer some level of resistance to relay attacks, which is a significant advantage given that other captchas offer no such resistance. Furthermore, the studied DCG captcha category demonstrated high usability. On the negative side, we have shown that this category is vulnerable to dictionary-based automated attacks.

Future research on DCG captchas should focus on improving resistance to automated attacks while maintaining good usability. Additionally, hybrid attacks, which combine computing power and human knowledge, should be investigated to understand their effectiveness and impact on the economics of captcha-solving. The results of our user study on reaction-time task performance may also have broader applications in human-centered computing, both in security and non-security domains.
