the following code worked within symfony 2.8 (patch action), after updating to
symfony 3.2 i always get into the if statement, even if there are no errors.
calling the validator myself, would tell everything is fine.
    $form = $this->createForm(UserType::USER_UPDATE, $user);
    $form->submit($request->request->all(), false);
    if (false === $form->isValid()) {
        ....
    }
Do i missed a change, that does not throw an exception, but ends in this
strange behavior?
I already refactored the createForm to:
    $form = $this->createForm(UserUpdateType::class, $user);
