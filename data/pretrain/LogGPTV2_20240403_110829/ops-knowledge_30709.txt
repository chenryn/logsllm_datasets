User: I don't have admin privileges on my work computer (OSX) and do some light Python scripting (mostly web scraping). I don't have admin privileges at work and don't really want to learn OSX but I also don't want to lug my Ubuntu laptop around everyday just to write scrapers. 
Is there a straightforward way for me to install modules without admin privileges? It seems like I need sudo to run easy_install. I can ask to have things installed, but I'd rather not have to ask every time I want to see if a module does what I need. FWIW, right now I just need BeautifulSoup and csv
Assistant: Just install virtualenv once, then work on local environments. It's a good practice too.
