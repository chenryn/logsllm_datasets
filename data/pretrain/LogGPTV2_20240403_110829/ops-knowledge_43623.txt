User: I'm trying to send a python script I wrote on my Mac to my friends. Problem is, I don't want to send them the code that they can edit. How can I have my script change from an editable text file, to a program that you click to run?
Assistant: You could try py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/) since it compiles your code into an exe file, they should have a hell of a time trying to decompose it.
