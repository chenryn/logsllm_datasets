That title was confusing!
● What I mean by “social attacks.”
● What I mean by “anonymity network.”
● How to be a more effective social engineer.
Not covered here
● Intro to anonymity networks.
– Basics of trafﬁc analysis
– Why use social engineering?
● Trivial attacks: no trafﬁc analysis required.
● Attacks to help trafﬁc analsysis.
– Trafﬁc gathering: more input for your attack.
– Network partitioning: better input for your attack.
● Defenses
Outline
Basic idea: anonymity networks
hide users among users...

...but when users act differently,
an observer can tell them apart.

...and separating users keeps them
from blending.

Against low-latency networks:
watch both ends and correlate trafﬁc.

If patterns (approximately) match,
Alice1 is talking to Bob2.
ex: Tor,
Freedom,
Pipenet, I2P,
JohnDoe,
Freenet
Against high-latency networks:
compare net with Alice to net without.
This (“long-term intersection”) attack
needs lots of trafﬁc.

So why not always use high-latency nets?

ex: cpunk, MixMaster, Mixminion
So, what should a smart attacker do?
● If possible, try to remove beneﬁts of
network from user.
● Otherwise, try to speed up trafﬁc analysis.
– Get more trafﬁc.
– Make the trafﬁc you get more useful.
– Lower volume of background trafﬁc
(High-latency nets only.)
Never attribute to malice...
● Caveat 1: Many harmful ideas occur to
people spontaneously.
● Caveat 2: Many harmful ideas are true.
I. Trivial attacks
Or,
“We’re jumping off a cliff. Wanna come?”
Why attack the network
when you can circumvent it?
Very Secure
Network
Alice
Attacker
“oops”
●“To view my ﬂash site, just enable plugins.” *
●“Click here for skype.” *
●“I’m not getting your mail. Just use yahoo, okay?” *
●“I love your ideas, and would like to donate.”
●“I love your ideas, and would like to meet.” *
Why attack the network
when you can replace it?
Very Secure
Network
Alice
Attacker
●“Your trafﬁc will be even more secure with anon2000!”*
●“I just read an attack paper on VSN. We should all use
ObscureNet!” *
●“VSN has a seekrit backdoor!” *
Less Secure
Network
Or,just attack the providers.
Vulnerable
Network
Alice
Bob
●“Help me with my criminal investigation of Alice, or
else.” *
● (“Why of course I’m an FBI agent! Would I lie?”) *
●“Say,we’re looking for a bug. Send me your logs?” *
●“Here’s some extra-fast extra-stable server software!” *
Long-term:
make the network unmaintained.
Unmaintained
Network
Alice
Bob
Can you make developers and providers quit?
●“Developer X is a jerk!” *
●“Dear Developer X. Thank you for the ﬁne
software. I enjoy using it for my nasty cause!” *
●“I am a provider, and I am quitting out of fear!” *
II. Getting more trafﬁc
Or,
“trafﬁc analysis is easy for the popular kids”
The more trafﬁc you see,
the more users you compromise...

How to win trafﬁc and compromise people
●“Please use my excellent server.” *
●“I’ve added extra features to my server.” *
●“Guide to better performance: Use fast
servers. Like mine.” *
●“Don’t use Bob’s server...
●it’s compromised.” *
●it’s surveiled.” *
●it’s in a bad country!” *
III. Partitioning attacks
Or,
“you can’t tell whether it was me, myself, or I!”
Network partitioning 1:
split one big network
into many small networks.

Partitioning 2:

they provide less cover for each other.

When users know servers at
random, you can partition them into
tiny sets.

...
P=20%
P=80%
P=40%
Only (.4)(.2)(.8) = .064 of users will use this
sequence in their paths.
How to encourage partitioning.
●“Here is my list of extra-good servers.” *
● “Here’s mine...”
●“Don’t use any servers in Germany or France.” *
● “No, don’t use any in the USA!”
● “Don’t use Germany or USA. France is ﬁne...”
● ...
●Start operator feuds.
●“Hi, I’m an operator, and I’m evil.” *
● “I agree with evil operator!” “I don’t!”
● ...
User preferences are a great
partitioning opportunity. *

If you can't partition the network,
you can try partitioning the trafﬁc.

IV.Defenses
Consensus-based server selection
stops lots of network partitioning.
●Provide a good default list of servers, and make
it easy to use.
(Needs to be self-updating and secure.)
●Example: Tor vs cpunk
Is this tripoption really necessary?
●Bad options: ciphersuite, padding len...
● cf. “painting the bikeshed”
●Good options:
Providers need thick skins.
●People will tell you stuff to get you to stop being
a provider.
● True stuff?
● In perspective?
●People will try to start provider ﬂamewars.
Demand clear descriptions of attacks.
●Is this attack novel?
● (Hint: RTFFAQ.)
●What are the requirements/results?
●Is this attack any better than end-to-end
correlation?
●Does this attack work against other systems of
this kind?
Paranoia is for newbs:
Be meta-paranoid.
●Paranoia:
Trust nobody completely.
●Meta-Paranoia:
This includes the people telling you
not to trust people.
Follow information to its source.
I’m suspicious of “some guy”:
he likes to spead
really awful information.
