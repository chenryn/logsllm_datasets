### Social Attacks Against Anonymity Networks

**Presenter:** Nick Mathewson  
**Organization:** The Tor Project  
**Event:** Defcon XV  
**Date:** August 4, 2007

#### Introduction
The title "Social Attacks Against Anonymity Networks" may be confusing. Let's clarify:
- **Social Attacks:** These are tactics that exploit human behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities.
- **Anonymity Network:** A system designed to protect user privacy by routing traffic through multiple servers, making it difficult to trace the origin and destination of the data.

This presentation will not cover:
- An introduction to anonymity networks.
- Basics of traffic analysis.
- Why social engineering is used.
- Trivial attacks that do not require traffic analysis.
- Attacks that aid in traffic analysis.
- Defenses against such attacks.

#### Outline
1. **Basic Idea: Anonymity Networks**
   - Anonymity networks aim to hide users among other users, making it difficult for observers to distinguish between them.
   - When users behave differently, an observer can identify and separate them, reducing the effectiveness of the network.
   - Distributed networks are used to ensure that no single server can compromise the entire system.

2. **Examples of Anonymity Networks**
   - **Tor:** A low-latency network where attackers can correlate traffic at both ends.
   - **Remailers, Mixminion, etc.:** High-latency networks where attackers compare traffic with and without a specific user to identify patterns.

3. **Challenges and Trade-offs**
   - **Low-Latency Networks:** Correlation attacks are possible by watching both ends of the communication.
   - **High-Latitude Networks:** Long-term intersection attacks require a large amount of traffic but are too slow for practical use.

4. **Strategies for Attackers**
   - **Remove Benefits of the Network:** Try to make the network less useful or secure for users.
   - **Speed Up Traffic Analysis:**
     - Increase the volume of traffic.
     - Make the traffic more useful for analysis.
     - Reduce the background noise (for high-latency networks).

5. **Caveats**
   - Many harmful ideas occur spontaneously and are not always malicious.
   - Some harmful ideas are true and should be addressed.

#### Types of Social Attacks

1. **Trivial Attacks**
   - **Circumventing the Network:**
     - Encourage users to disable security features.
     - Persuade users to switch to less secure methods.
   - **Replacing the Network:**
     - Promote alternative, less secure networks.
     - Spread false information about the current network.

2. **Attacking Providers:**
   - Threaten or coerce providers into compromising the network.
   - Intimidate developers and providers to quit.

3. **Increasing Traffic:**
   - Make your service popular to gather more traffic.
   - Promote your servers as faster or more reliable.
   - Discredit other servers to drive traffic to yours.

4. **Partitioning Attacks:**
   - **Network Partitioning:**
     - Split a large network into smaller, more vulnerable segments.
     - Encourage users to prefer certain servers, reducing mutual cover.
   - **User Preferences:**
     - Exploit user preferences to create small, isolated groups.
     - Start feuds between operators to further partition the network.

#### Defenses

1. **Consensus-Based Server Selection:**
   - Provide a good default list of servers and make it easy to use.
   - Example: Tor vs. cpunk.

2. **Provider Resilience:**
   - Providers need to develop thick skins and resist intimidation.
   - Evaluate threats and misinformation critically.

3. **Clear Descriptions of Attacks:**
   - Demand detailed and accurate descriptions of potential attacks.
   - Assess the novelty, requirements, and effectiveness of each attack.

4. **Paranoia and Meta-Paranoia:**
   - Be cautious but also skeptical of overly paranoid advice.
   - Verify information and follow it to its source.
