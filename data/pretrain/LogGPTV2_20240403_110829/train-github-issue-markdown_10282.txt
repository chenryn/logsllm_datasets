### Version
2.5.17
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/nrpjvl3v0
### Steps to reproduce
If you look at the linked code sandbox, there is a simple directive being used
on a normal component, a functional component using a render function, and a
functional component using a template. I could not find a way to get the
directive passed through in the functional template example. Essentially a
similar approach to `v-bind="attrs"` and `v-on='listeners"` but for
directives.
Is this currently possible? If not, would it be considered? Otherwise - in
order to write functional template components, you would need to ensure they
are never intended to be used with custom directives.
Our specific use case was that we have a base button component that is a
functional template components, but it doesn't work with
https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue2-touch-events
### What is expected?
A method through the functional template to proxy through directives.
### What is actually happening?
The custom directive cannot be applied to the functional template component.
