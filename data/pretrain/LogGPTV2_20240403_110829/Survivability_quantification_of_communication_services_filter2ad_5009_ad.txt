between s = 1 and d = 10 is depicted in Figure 8. The
performance of the virtual connection is evaluated after the
failure of node 4 at time t = 500. Again each node is
an M/M/1/ni system with the parameters given in Ta-
ble 2. The parameters in the phased recovery model are
αd = αu = 0.01 and τ = 0.001.
The network example is studied by simulations and one
analytic approach. The estimated performance metrics from
90 simulation replica (Simulations) are compared with the
analytical values of the time-space decomposed model (De-
composed CTMC model). The results are given in Fig-
ures 9(a) and 9(b), for the loss probability and average num-
ber of packets in the system at different t, respectively. The
results show that the closed form solution from Section 5
captures the transient performance very well.
Figure 9(a) also includes a “rerouting model” which is
r(t) = q(1, 4)e−αdt, i.e.
the probability that a packet is
lost in the failed node at time t after the instant of failure.
The q(1, 4) = q14 + q12q23q34 is the probability of visit-
ing node 4 when starting from node 1 in the directed graph
#G[1,10] in Figure 8. The results in Figure 9(a) show almost
perfect overlap between r(t) and l(t) from (2) which means
that with very low steady-state packet loss probability, the
transient loss probability is dominated by q(1, 4) with the
Figure 9. Performance in 10 node network
decay rate equal to the reciprocal of the expected rerouting
time 1/αd. The same is not observed in the 4-node network
because here steady-state loss probability is not negligible.
9 Closing remarks
The time-space decomposed model with the closed form
solution is a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation that can easily model
huge networks with large, even inﬁnite, buffers. In this pa-
per we have cross-validated our analytical and simulation
models, and checked the approximations of the decomposed
analytical models. The results from the survivability stud-
ies show that when the transient performance impairment is
dominated by a failure event the decomposed, product form
approximation is a viable approach.
In cases where the space decomposition is inaccurate
still time decomposition should be considered because it
will help reduce the complexity of the transient solution sig-
niﬁcantly.
The assumptions made in our models will be relaxed in
the future allowing for multiple failures, general distribu-

proach is applied to a larger network where transient delay
distributions are obtained. We import routing probabilities
from ns-2 simulations before and after a failure, and before
and after a repair. This is ongoing research with promis-
ing preliminary results. The routing probabilities can also
be obtained from operational networks. We plan to extend
the phased recovery model to include more details regard-
ing the virtual connection management at failure and repair,
and possibly to include multiple failure modes.
