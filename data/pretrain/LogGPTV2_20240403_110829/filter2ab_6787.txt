ATT&CK ID:M1037
ATT&CK Technique Name:Filter Network Traffic
Consider filtering DHCP traffic on ports 67 and 68 to/from unknown or untrusted DHCP servers. Additionally, port security may also be enabled on layer switches. Furthermore, consider enabling DHCP snooping on layer 2 switches as it will prevent DHCP spoofing attacks and starvation attacks. Consider tracking available IP addresses through a script or a tool. Additionally, block DHCPv6 traffic and incoming router advertisements, especially if IPv6 is not commonly used in the network.[5]
