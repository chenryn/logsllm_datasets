**Abstract:**
Anomaly localization, a critical task in IT operations, aims to identify the affected scope of Internet infrastructure when an anomaly alarm is triggered. This task is particularly challenging due to the vast search space. Existing solutions often perform poorly in Content Delivery Network (CDN) scenarios because they rely on assumptions that do not align with real-world anomaly patterns. To address this, we introduce RAPMiner, a mechanism that first uses classification power-based redundant attribute deletion to eliminate non-root cause attribute combinations. It then employs an anomaly confidence-guided, layer-by-layer, top-down search to avoid identifying anomalies that are not root causes. These strategies effectively reduce the search space. Experimental results demonstrate that RAPMiner achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Squeeze dataset, as measured by F1-score and efficiency, and shows the best RC@k with stable parameter sensitivity on the RAPMD dataset.

## I. Introduction

The increasing complexity and scale of today's Internet infrastructures make failures and service degradations inevitable. To detect and manage these issues, human operators monitor various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Anomaly alarms typically indicate potential failures or service degradations, such as configuration errors, software defects, network and server overloads, or failures. Rapidly responding to these alarms is crucial to prevent further performance degradation and ensure a high quality of experience (QoE) for users. Anomaly localization, which identifies the affected scope of the system or infrastructure, is essential for timely switching of impacted users to backup systems.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are vital Internet infrastructures that deliver content and ensure high QoE. With the growing scale, edge nodes of commercial CDNs now serve hundreds or even thousands of websites, making IT operations for such distributed infrastructures challenging. While some studies focus on anomaly detection for CDNs, they lack effective anomaly localization, which is currently a manual, time-consuming process. There is an urgent need for an automated method to efficiently conduct anomaly localization in CDNs.

### Analysis of Real-World CDN Operations

In our study, we analyzed a real-world ISP-operated CDN in China. Users served by a CDN can be characterized by a four-tuple: the location of the edge node, access type, operating system (OS) of the device, and the website being accessed. Anomaly localization often depends on KPIs with varying-grained attribute combinations. Fine-grained KPIs, such as (L1, wireless, Android, Site1), represent the performance of specific user groups, while coarse-grained KPIs, like (L1, *, *, Site1), indicate the service status of a broader user group. The goal of anomaly localization is to find the coarsest-grained attribute combination among those with anomalous KPIs, known as the Root Anomaly Pattern (RAP).

### Challenges in Anomaly Localization

Despite existing studies on root anomaly pattern mining, two main challenges persist in real-world CDNs:

**Challenge 1: Huge Search Space**
The search space for anomaly localization increases exponentially with the number of attributes and their elements. For example, a real-world CDN may have 33 locations, 4 access types, 4 OS types, and 20 websites, resulting in a search space of \(2^{20 \times 33 \times 4 \times 4}\). Existing methods narrow this space through strict assumptions, such as Adtributor assuming 1-dimensional attribute combinations and HotSpot and Squeeze assuming uniform anomaly magnitudes. However, these assumptions do not hold in real-world CDNs.

**Challenge 2: Determination Rule for RAP**
Characterizing the differences between root and non-root anomaly patterns is challenging. Existing studies use metrics like the ripple effect (HotSpot) and isolation power (iDice) to determine RAPs. While these metrics are effective, they often depend on specific scenarios and assumptions, limiting their applicability to real-world CDNs.

### Proposed Solution: RAPMiner

To address these challenges, we propose RAPMiner, a mechanism that considers practical distribution features of root anomaly patterns without relying on ideal assumptions. RAPMiner introduces a metric called Classification Power (CP) to determine if an attribute is independent of a root anomaly pattern and combines it with Anomaly Confidence (AC) to judge whether an attribute combination is anomalous. This approach effectively narrows the search space and addresses the determination rule challenge.

**Conclusion:**
Experimental results show that RAPMiner performs comparably to SOTA methods on the Squeeze dataset and demonstrates the best RC@k with stable parameter sensitivity on the RAPMD dataset. RAPMiner provides a practical and efficient solution for anomaly localization in real-world CDNs.
