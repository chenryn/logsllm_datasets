**ATT&CK ID:** T1553.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking

Adversaries may tamper with Software Integrity Policies (SIP) and trust provider components to deceive the operating system and application control tools during signature validation checks. In user mode, Windows Authenticode digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, which are critical for establishing trust in signed code (e.g., a driver with a valid Microsoft signature is generally considered safe).

The signature validation process is managed by the `WinVerifyTrust` application programming interface (API) function. This function receives an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating the parameters of the digital signature. By hijacking or manipulating these components, adversaries can bypass security controls and execute malicious code while maintaining the appearance of a trusted and verified source.
