**ATT&CK ID:** C0014  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operation Wocao

During Operation Wocao, the threat actors executed the following command to detect recent PuTTY sessions, likely as a means to facilitate further lateral movement:

```bash
/c cd /d c:\windows\temp\ & reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PuTTY\Sessions\
```

This command changes the directory to `c:\windows\temp\` and then queries the Windows Registry for any saved PuTTY session information stored under the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PuTTY\Sessions\` key. This technique can help the attackers identify potential targets for lateral movement within the network.
