### WDCloud 2TB
- **Traffic Analysis:**
  - High volume of network traffic, including ARP broadcasts, SSDP M-SEARCH, and SSDP NOTIFY.
  - The majority of the traffic originates from an embedded Twonky Media Server, which frequently pings iRadio and IPCam devices on the local network.
  - Protocols in use: SSH, SMB, HTTP.

- **Unexpected Traffic:**
  - The observed traffic exceeds typical expectations for a NAS device, suggesting additional, possibly unnecessary, network activity.

### WDCloud 2TB (2)
- **Phone Home Activity:**
  - The device communicates with external servers, likely for status updates or registration.
  - Example requests:
    - `GET /rest/nexus/onlineStatus?tsin=WD01 HTTP/1.1`
    - `GET /rest/nexus/registerDevice?ip_internal=192.168.186.18 ...`
    - `GET /rest/nexus/ipCheck HTTP/1.1`
    - `GET /nas/list.asp?devtype=sq&devfw=04.01.03-421&devlang=eng&devsn=&auto=1 HTTP/1.1`
    - `GET /api/1.0/rest/remote_access_status/2208751 HTTP/1.1`

### WDCloud 2TB (3)
- **Noisy Twonky Media Server:**
  - The Twonky Media Server generates a significant amount of traffic, particularly when interacting with other devices on the LAN.
  - Example interactions:
    - `GET /rootDesc.xml HTTP/1.1`
    - `POST / HTTP/1.1` (HTTP/XML)
    - Frequent attempts to interact with the IPCam, which often returns a 500 Internal Server Error.
    - Regular checks with iRadio (subscribed once).

### WDCloud 2TB (4)
- **External Scans:**
  - The device is subject to various external scans, including:
    - Kiddie scans (e.g., `GET /cgi-bin/authLogin.cgi HTTP/1.0`)
    - SMB scans (e.g., `Trans2 Request, GET_DFS_REFERRAL`)

### WDCloud 2TB (5)
- **Additional Observations:**
  - The device communicates with WDC.Com for port testing and returns a device ID.
  - HTTPS communication with external servers, not intercepted by MITM.
  - Multiple attempts to guess the SSH password.

### AppleTV
- **Network Activity:**
  - Port 7000 from a Mac.
  - iPhone sync port 62078.
  - Scans from multiple sources on ports 5000, 7000, and 62078.
  - No other incoming connections.
  - Periodic phone home activity to Apple servers.

### AppleTV (2)
- **Scans and Probes:**
  - Network scans from various sources, including 360 (China), Denmark, Netherlands, and Colocrossing.

### Samsung SmartTV
- **Outbound Connections:**
  - Frequent outbound connections to Samsung and other third-party servers.
  - Shodan and other probes on ports 22, 80, and 443.
  - Encrypted inbound connections on port 34363.

### Samsung SmartTV (2)
- **Normal Outbound Traffic:**
  - Regular updates and time synchronization requests.
  - Example requests:
    - `GET /global/products/tv/infolink/us.xml HTTP/1.1`
    - `GET /openapi/timesync?client=TimeAgent/1.0 HTTP/1.1`
    - `GET /openapi/zipcode/timezoneoffset?cc=DE&zip=85399&client=TimeAgent/1.0 HTTP/1.1`

### Samsung SmartTV (3)
- **Inbound Scans:**
  - Various HTTP GET requests from different IP addresses.
  - Netclue.de scans on multiple ports.

### Samsung SmartTV (4)
- **Weird Inbound TCP 34363:**
  - Unusual SYN packets on port 34363, possibly indicating a probe or attempt to establish a connection.

### Samsung SmartCam
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Known URI XSS vulnerability (2013-3964).
  - Default passwords: `root/root`, `admin/4321`.
  - Limited scanning activity, primarily from script kiddies.

### Samsung SmartCam (2)
- **Brainless Scanning:**
  - Various HTTP GET requests from different IP addresses, often targeting unrelated resources.

### iMac
- **Security and Traffic:**
  - Open SSH port.
  - Regular traffic to Apple for updates and store access.
  - Frequent probes and brute force attempts on port 22 from various IP addresses.

### iMac (2)
- **Additional Information:**
  - [Add any additional details or observations here]

### iRadio
- **Network Activity:**
  - No open ports, primarily used for streaming audio.
  - Pinged by WDCloud Twonky for UPnP AV DCP.
  - Occasional zero-length packets to rfe2b-r1.alldigital.net.

### Attacks?
- **Summary:**
  - Mostly script kiddies.
  - No successful hacks detected.
  - One instance of a D-Link IPCam being accessed, but infrequent.
