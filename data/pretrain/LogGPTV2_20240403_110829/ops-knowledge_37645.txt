User: A couple of days after uninstalling Python 3.4.2 I had to carry out a system restore (I'm using Windows 7) due to accidentally installing a bunch of rubbish-ware that was messing with my computer even after installation. This system restore effectively "reinstalled" Python, or rather a broken version of it. I now can't uninstall it via the usual Control Panel -> Uninstall Programs tool, nor can I reinstall it using the original installer. Unfortunately Windows has not saved an earlier system snapshot that I could restore to.
Both the uninstall and reinstall processes make a fair bit of progress before stopping with a warning error that says: "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor"
Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might succeed in this uninstallation?
Assistant: Just had this problem and solved it by hitting repair first then uninstall.
