It seems like you're having trouble starting IPython after installing it using `pip` on your Mac, which is running Python 2.7. Here are some steps to help diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. **Check if IPython is installed:**
   Run the following command to see if IPython is listed as an installed package:
   ```sh
   pip list
   ```
   You should see `ipython` in the list of installed packages.

2. **Verify the installation path:**
   Use the `which` command to check if IPython is in your system's PATH:
   ```sh
   which ipython
   ```
   If this command returns a path, it means IPython is installed and accessible. If it returns nothing, IPython might not be in your PATH.

3. **Check your PATH environment variable:**
   Ensure that the directory where IPython is installed is included in your `PATH`:
   ```sh
   echo $PATH
   ```
   The output should include the directory where IPython is installed (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`).

4. **Inspect the installation details:**
   Use the following command to get more information about the installed IPython package:
   ```sh
   pip show ipython
   ```

5. **Check for the `.ipython` directory:**
   IPython typically creates a configuration directory in your home directory named `.ipython`. Check if this directory exists:
   ```sh
   ls -a ~ | grep .ipython
   ```

6. **Reinstall IPython:**
   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try reinstalling IPython:
   ```sh
   pip uninstall ipython
   pip install ipython
   ```

7. **Watch for error messages:**
   During the reinstallation, carefully observe any error messages that might indicate why the installation is failing.

If you still encounter issues, please provide the output of the commands mentioned above, and I can help further diagnose the problem.

Thank you!
