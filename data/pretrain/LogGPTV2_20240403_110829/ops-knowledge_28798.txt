User: I installed ipython using pip. I have python 2.7 on my Mac. However I am unable to start up ipython. 
[17:26:01] ipython
-bash: ipython: command not found
Then thinking that maybe I need to run it from within python I even tried that
[17:28:10] python 
import ipython 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named ipython
Any idea what is wrong?
Thanks.
Assistant: Try these shell commands.  I'm using Debian, & don't have a Mac.
which ipython
Should show the dir where it is installed, eg, /usr/bin/ipython
echo $PATH
Should show a list of paths where the system looks for programs to execute; it should include the location of ipython, eg, /usr/bin for my example above.
pip list 
Should include 'ipython' in the list of installed pkgs.
pip show ipython
Should show data about the installed ipython pkg.
Your home directory should have  a dir called '.ipython' if the pkg was installed (unless it was put somewhere else).
If you don't find the program, maybe the install failed.  Try again and watch for error messages.
