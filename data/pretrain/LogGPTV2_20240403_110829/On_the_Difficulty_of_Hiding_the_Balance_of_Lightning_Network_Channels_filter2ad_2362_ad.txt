### Masking Node Capacity and Throughput in Payment Networks

The proposed solution aims to mask the capacity and throughput of nodes in payment networks, supporting both discrete and continuous time constraints. It is essential to ensure that the addition or subtraction of masking resources has the minimal possible impact on the payment network, such as minimizing service disruptions. Implementing this solution in current payment networks, like the Lightning Network, will require significant effort and may necessitate a redesign of how these networks operate. This could include providing mechanisms for interested parties to absorb negative balances. A more straightforward approach might be the use of private channels between nodes, which are not announced to the entire network, allowing for the private compensation of negative balances.

#### 1. Blockchain Analysis and Privacy Issues
Several studies have investigated adversarial issues related to privacy and information disclosure in cryptocurrencies and routing. We review some examples, categorizing them into two main research lines: blockchain analysis and traffic analysis.

- **Blockchain Analysis**: By definition, any blockchain includes all transactions performed by the system. Deanonymization can exploit this information. Simple blockchain analysis can reveal the source and destination Bitcoin addresses [29]. Clustering techniques, such as address clustering, shadow address analysis, and behavior-based clustering (e.g., k-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering), can enhance the deanonymization process [2, 22, 30, 34]. Once a large enough cluster of addresses for a user is identified, external information (e.g., posts, forums, markets, and market exchanges) can be used to deanonymize at least one address.
  
- **Traffic Analysis**: Transactions in Bitcoin are transmitted through a P2P network [12], and metadata such as TCP or IP headers can be used for deanonymization [20]. Transaction eavesdropping can help identify the IP addresses of nodes broadcasting transactions. The problem can be modeled as an evaluation of association rules, identifying confidence scores and support counts [20]. Additionally, Bitcoin sessions initiated by nodes that become unreachable after a certain period (e.g., nodes behind NAT and TOR connections) can be analyzed via fingerprinting techniques to highlight pseudonymity weaknesses [21].

#### 2. Cryptocurrencies Literature
Anonymity in Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies typically relies on pseudonymity, where users create multiple anonymous account addresses. However, the underlying non-anonymous Internet infrastructure and the availability of transaction metadata in the blockchain enable the development of deanonymization tools. We classify the literature into four main categories [10, 17]: (1) blockchain analysis, (2) network monitoring, (3) attacks on mixing protocols, and (4) balance disclosure.

- **Mixing Protocol Attacks**: Mixing protocols aim to enhance Bitcoin transaction anonymity by shuffling information to obscure the relationship between input and output values [6, 7, 23, 25]. However, these systems have been analyzed and found to have vulnerabilities that can be exploited for deanonymization. For example, modeling and analysis of the P2P Bitcoin networking stack have shown that the real Bitcoin P2P network topology offers a low degree of anonymity [15].
  
- **Balance Disclosure**: The risk of leakage regarding the balance of Bitcoin addresses has been addressed in [1]. The work suggests hiding transaction values and address balances, especially for users who opt out of exchanging assets. Countermeasures to double-spending attacks, which involve directly broadcasting double-spending transactions from different network locations, lead to new designs with more control over node balances. This additional control, however, increases the likelihood of deanonymization. Alternative cryptocurrencies like Zerocash, which use zero-knowledge proof techniques, offer stronger privacy guarantees [33].

- **Tor and Bitcoin**: The feasibility of deanonymizing Tor hidden services due to Bitcoin-related information leaks has also been discussed. Techniques have been developed to link Bitcoin users who share their addresses on social networks with hidden services, thereby disclosing sensitive information [18].

#### 3. Routing Literature
Beyond cryptocurrencies, similar privacy issues exist in other areas such as distributed computing, ad hoc, and sensor networking. Secure routing techniques are vulnerable to adversarial probing attacks, and countermeasures have been proposed [16, 27]. Energy-driven literature in smart-grid and smart-metering environments also shares similarities with the issues and solutions discussed in our work. For instance, privacy-preserving techniques in smart-metering aim to conceal adversaries by adding synthetic computing and storage functionalities to avoid fine-grained collection of user information [4, 3, 35].

### Conclusion

This paper addresses privacy issues in the Bitcoin Lightning Network. To preserve user privacy, the precise balance of channels is kept secret, making the routing discovery protocol less efficient but maintaining channel balance privacy. Publicly disclosing updated channel balances would improve route finding efficiency but compromise payment privacy. Our work uncovers a balance discovery attack that can be used to deanonymize network payments. We present an analysis and experimental results to validate our claims, discuss potential countermeasures, and conduct a responsible disclosure to the Lightning Network developers.
