quired to send a RTS to the interferer and hence optimizes
the “ﬂoor space” acquired by any ﬂow. Unlike PCMA, how-
ever SHUSH transmits at a higher power only when a ﬂow
is interrupted by external interference. Again SHUSH as-
sumes ﬁne grained control on power levels and ignores RSSI
variations which can make it diﬃcult to infer the exact inter-
ference at the receiver, thereby complicating the calculation
of target transmit power required to SHUSH the interferer.
Our experimental observations suggest that such observa-
tions are too deviant from realistic scenarios.
Bejerano et al. proposed a load balancing algorithm called
Cell Breathing [5], where APs vary their transmit power to
control the number of clients associated with them. The
theoretical formulation and simulation results indicate that
such a scheme could give substantial gains. However, they
assume that the AP’s can perform ﬁne-grained transmit
power control (∼ 1dBm) and ignore the SNR variations
at the client. Using our empirically derived power control
model (Section 4), the above mechanisms could dynamically
determine an exact set of feasible power values to be used
in an environment.
Time Dimension of Fine Grained Power Control
Many researchers in the past have proposed schemes which
require change in the power level on a per packet basis.
Akella et al. [2] discuss some power control mechanisms
in their work on wireless hotspots. They propose that APs
should use the minimum transmit power required to support
the highest transmission rate. In their scheme, the receiver
sends the value of observed RSSI, averaged over some small
number of packets, as a feedback to the transmitter. The
transmitter on receiving the average RSSI value on the re-
ceiver side, decides the optimal power level suitable for use
in the current channel conditions. However they do not pro-
vide exact values for power level granularity that should be
used. As discussed earlier, a simple average of RSSI values
at the receiver may not give a correct estimate of the actual
SNR.
Subbarao [20] has proposed a dynamic power-conscious
routing mechanism that incorporates link layer and physical
layer properties in routing metrics. It routes the packet on a
path that requires least amount of total power expended and
each node transmits with the optimum (minimum) power
to ensure reliable communication. This scheme requires per
packet power control and also needs feedback from the des-
tination regarding RSSI on a per packet basis.
Similar to PCMA approach, Yeh et al.
[21] proposed an
interference/power aware access control. They augment the
normal RTS/CTS mechanism of IEEE 802.11 with provi-
sion for multi level RTS, where the transmit power of the
RTS mechanism is set on the basis of the intended receiver.
Such a dynamic per packet approach becomes diﬃcult in
the face of signiﬁcant RSSI variations and become diﬃcult
to implement on real systems.
We analyze the stationarity (coherence time) of signal
strength for various scenarios and propose a simple algo-
rithm Online-RSSI, that can be used to determine the dis-
tribution of signal strength for a given transmit power level
in any scenario. Once the set of feasible power levels (hav-
ing non overlapping signal strength distribution) is derived,
the receiver can use this model to determine the transmit
power of the transmitter for a packet received at any given
signal strength and hence provide correct feedback to the
transmitter on a per packet basis (or similar time scales).
3. CHARACTERIZING SIGNAL STRENGTH
DISTRIBUTION
Our experiments serve three main purposes: (i) to gain
an understanding of the characteristics of RSSI variations
under varying practical scenarios (in terms of user move-
ments, shadowing, multipath and external interference) (ii)
as a learning data-set to build our empirical model for iden-
tifying the set of feasible power levels (iii) as an input to
validate this model.
In this section, we characterize the distribution of RSSI
under varying magnitudes of multipath, shadowing and other
802.11 and non 802.11 interference for a real WLAN deploy-
ment shown in Figure 2. By studying the RSSI distribu-
tion across diﬀerent power levels and diﬀerent channel condi-
tions, we formulate mechanisms to dynamically predict and
construct such distributions in real-time. Such mechanisms
shall be used in the next section where we build a model
to predict the useful power-levels in a given environment.
We brieﬂy describe various components of our experimental
setup.
3.1 RSSI measurements
The performance of most wireless applications depends on
the packet delivery probability. The SNR is widely used in
the literature to model packet delivery probabilities: packets
are successfully received if S/(I+N) is above a certain thresh-
old, and otherwise are not. Commodity wireless cards do
not report the information required to compute SNR. For
instance, our cards report only their version of RSSI, the
minimum feedback allowed by the 802.11 standard. Some
other cards also report an estimate of I by measuring energy
in the air when no packets are being sent, but this estimate
may be inaccurate during packet delivery. It has been shown
in a prior measurement based study by Reis et. al [8] that
RSSI is generally predictive of delivery probability in static
wireless networks and while wireless networks exhibit sub-
stantial variability, measurements of average behavior over
even relatively short time periods tend to be stable. This
phenomenon was also observed in our joint power and data
rate adaptation experiments (described as an application of
our model in Section 5), where the power levels with sig-
niﬁcant overlap in their corresponding RSSI distribution,
perform similarly in terms of rate adaptation. Since rate
adaptation again depends on packet delivery rate, we can
infer that RSSI is a reasonable estimate for SNR and two
power levels with signiﬁcant RSSI overlap at the receiver will
perform similarly for packet delivery probabilities. Hence we
base our measurements and models on RSSI values that is
readily available from the commodity wireless cards.
RSSI estimates signal energy at the receiver during packet
reception, measured during PLCP headers of arriving pack-
ets and reported on proprietary (and diﬀerent) scales. Atheros
cards, for example report RSSI as 10log10( S+I
n ), where S is
the signal strength of the incoming signal, I is the interfer-
ing energy in the same band, and n is a constant (−95dBm)
that represents the ”noise ﬂoor” inside the radio. Atheros

Figure 4: Figure shows the setup used to determine
power drawn by wireless cards. The DAQ samples
voltage across the WiFi device and sends it to a PC
via USB. Performed at transmitter to validate the
power levels available at the hardware.
RSSI is thus dB relative to the noise ﬂoor. To give results
that are independent of card vendors, we transform RSSI
values to received signal strength (RSS) values, that give ab-
solute energy levels. That is, RSSI is deﬁned to be S+I.
Note that these RSSI measurements are performed at the
receiver and then provided as a feedback to the transmit-
ter for constructing the empirical model for feasible power
levels.
3.2 Validating Available Hardware Power
Levels
To ascertain the available power levels in 802.11 WLAN
cards, we measure the voltage across the wireless card of the
transmitter by the setup shown in ﬁgure 4. The setup con-
stitutes of a 0.1 ohm sense resistor, R, connected in series to
the circuit of the wireless device (pcmcia card) that exposes
the voltage supplied to the device. For the pcmcia based
802.11 card, we used the Sycard 140A cardbus adapter, to
expose the voltage supplied to the card. A Data Acquisition
Card (DAQ), DS1M12 Stingray Oscilloscope, samples the
voltage through R at a rate of 1 million samples per second,
thereby giving us voltage measurements on a per packet ba-
sis. The instantaneous power consumption, Pi can therefore
be written as Pi = Vd × VR/R where Vd is the voltage pro-
vided to the WiFi device and VR is the voltage drop across R
at a given moment. These measurements are performed at
the transmitter and shows that indeed the right power levels
are implemented at the hardware circuitry of the transmit-
ter’s wireless interface. On the basis of power consumed by
the wireless interface, we validated that Cisco Aironet cards
provide 6 diﬀerent power levels for 802.11g and 5 diﬀerent
power levels for 802.11a respectively.
3.3 WLAN Trace Collection
In order to understand the behavior of RSSI under vary-
ing interference and multipath eﬀects, we conduct detailed
experiments to collect RSSI traces in an oﬃce building un-
der varied indoor settings. In all our experiments, we use a
ﬁxed data rate of 1Mbps and ﬁxed packet size of 1KB, so
that the time intervals are directly translated into number of
packets (modulo 802.11 DCF), which is the X axis for most
of our plots. This facilitates easier packet based analysis of
RSSI traces and their implications to power control mecha-
nisms, which generally base their decisions on a per packet
basis. For our experiments, 1 sec of receiver time window
≈ 1000 packets of 1KB each (unless otherwise speciﬁed).
We repeated the same experiments with other wireless cards
and found the results were consistent with the ones reported
here. We discuss the exact set up for each of these scenarios.
Line of Sight - light interference(LOS-light)
These experiments represent a scenario where the transmitter-
receiver pair are in direct line-of-sight and have minimal to
zero external interference. Figure 2 shows the placement of
transmitter-receiver pair T2 and R2 respectively for LOS-
light experiment. The experiment used 2 IBM Thinkpad
laptops running Linux kernel 2.6. Each of the laptops housed
an Atheros chipset based 802.11a/g Linksys wireless card
and used Madwiﬁ drivers. We used Netperf 2.2 to generate
UDP ﬂows between the two laptops and collected MAC-level
traces for the packets received at the receiver using the pcap
standard library. We vary the power of the transmitter to
understand their corresponding eﬀects on RSSI.

Non Line of Sight - light interference(NLOS-light)
The experiment comprises of a single transmitter T1 and 5
receivers (RB-1, RB-8, RB-10, RB-11 and RB-12) as shown
in Figure 2 placed at various locations in the building and
used netperf and pcap library to generate ﬂows and col-
lect traces respectively. None of the receivers were in direct
line-of-sight of T1 and this setup too had minimal to zero
external interference.
Line of Sight - heavy interference(LOS-heavy)
We investigate the eﬀect of controlled interference on RSSI.
We use our experimental testbed shown in ﬁgure 2 for line of
sight experiments to evaluate the eﬀect of heavy interference
(like bulk data transfers) on RSSI variations. Nodes RB-
12, RB-11 and RB-2 act as separate APs and perform bulk
data transfers with their respective clients (3 IBM laptops).
Nodes T2 and R2 form a transmitter-receiver pair.
Non Line of Sight - heavy interference(NLOS-heavy)
We use our experimental testbed shown in ﬁgure 2 for non-
line of sight experiments to evaluate the eﬀect of heavy inter-
ference (like bulk data transfers) on RSSI variations. Nodes
RB-12, RB-11 and RB-2 act as separate APs and perform
bulk data transfers with their respective clients (3 IBM lap-
tops). Nodes T1 and RB-8 form a transmitter-receiver pair.
3.4 Analyzing WLAN Traces
Figure 5 shows the smoothed moving average of RSSI
per packet for the four categories of traces described in
previous section. Although we collect many traces from
each category (namely LOS-light, NLOS-light,LOS-Heavy
and NLOS-heavy), we present only one representative trace
from each category. The representative trace is chosen such
that it manifests the basic characteristic of traces from that
particular category. All these traces are collected at 1Mbps
of data rate with packet size of 1000 bytes.
As clear from Figure 5, the variations in RSSI is minimum
for LOS-light trace and is maximum for the NLOS-heavy
trace. This behavior is expected because the factors con-
tributing to RSSI variations increase in both number and
magnitude from the topmost plot to the bottom. Figure
6 show the probability distribution of RSSI values at the
receiver for the four scenarios. Clearly, the distribution of
RSSI becomes ﬂatter (larger variation) with the increase in
interference and multipath eﬀects, with the distribution of
Figure 5: Exponentially weighted moving average of
RSSI over time for four traces collected under var-
ious practical scenarios, with varying degree of ex-
ternal interference, multipath, shadowing and fading
eﬀects. The packets are sorted in order of received
time. The traces from topmost plot to the bottom
belong to LOS-light, NLOS-light, NLOS-heavy and
LOS-heavy. The high variation of RSSI for NLOS-
heavy can be observed.
LOS-light and NLOS-light resembling a Gaussian distribu-
tion. Next we analyze these trace in detail to understand
temporal variations in RSSI and propose an algorithm to
dynamically characterize the distribution of RSSI in any en-
vironment.
Stationarity
Figure 5 shows the variation of RSSI on a per packet ba-
sis, but it would also be useful to observe the amount of
ﬂuctuation over a set of packets (or a burst). Such an anal-
ysis would reveal any characteristic burst intervals where
RSSI values vary largely over diﬀerent bursts but deviate
minimally within a burst. Also note that since our experi-
ments are conducted with the traﬃc sent at uniform rates
packet intervals directly correspond to time intervals (mod-
ulo 802.11 DCF eﬀects). One way to summarize changes
at diﬀerent time scale is to plot the Allan deviation [3] at
each packet interval. Allan deviation is the square root
of the two sample variance formed by the average of the
squared diﬀerences between successive values of a regularly
measured quantity taken from sampling periods of the mea-
surement interval. Allan deviation diﬀers from standard de-
viation in that it uses diﬀerences between successive sam-
ples, rather than the diﬀerence between each sample and
long term mean. In this case, the samples are the fraction
of packets delivered in successive intervals of a particular
length. The Allan deviation is appropriate for data sets
where data has persistent ﬂuctuations away from the mean.
The formula for the Allan deviation for N measurements of
Ti and sampling period τ0 is:
