User: Is there way to determine which environment variables returned by os.environ belongs to current user and which one - to all users? I do not want to change it, only get.
UPD: I am using Microsoft Windows 7.
Assistant: you can get all the variables by 
import os
print(os.environ)
this will return you the dictionary type of output with keys as enviornment variables and values as the values of the enviornment variables.
to get the current username:
print(os.environ['USERNAME'])
Look for yourself what you want in the dictionary.
