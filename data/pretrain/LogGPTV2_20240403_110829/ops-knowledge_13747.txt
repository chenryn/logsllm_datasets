**User:**
Is there a way to determine which environment variables returned by `os.environ` belong to the current user and which ones are system-wide (i.e., apply to all users)? I do not want to change them; I only want to retrieve this information. 

**Update:** I am using Microsoft Windows 7.

**Assistant:**
To retrieve all environment variables, you can use the `os.environ` dictionary in Python. This will provide you with a dictionary where the keys are the environment variable names and the values are their corresponding values.

Here is an example of how to print all environment variables:

```python
import os

# Print all environment variables
print(os.environ)
```

This will output a dictionary containing all the environment variables and their values.

To get the current username, you can access the `USERNAME` environment variable:

```python
# Get the current username
current_username = os.environ['USERNAME']
print(current_username)
```

However, distinguishing between user-specific and system-wide environment variables programmatically can be a bit more complex. In Windows, user-specific environment variables are typically stored in the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry hive, while system-wide environment variables are stored in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` hive.

To inspect these, you might need to query the Windows Registry directly. For example, you can use the `winreg` module to read from the registry:

```python
import winreg

# Function to read environment variables from a specific registry key
def get_env_vars_from_registry(hive, key_path):
    with winreg.OpenKey(hive, key_path) as key:
        i = 0
        while True:
            try:
                name, value, _ = winreg.EnumValue(key, i)
                yield name, value
                i += 1
            except OSError:
                break

# User-specific environment variables
user_env_vars = dict(get_env_vars_from_registry(winreg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER, r'Environment'))

# System-wide environment variables
system_env_vars = dict(get_env_vars_from_registry(winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, r'SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment'))

print("User-specific environment variables:")
for name, value in user_env_vars.items():
    print(f"{name}: {value}")

print("\nSystem-wide environment variables:")
for name, value in system_env_vars.items():
    print(f"{name}: {value}")
```

This script will list the user-specific and system-wide environment variables separately. You can then compare these with the `os.environ` dictionary to identify which variables are user-specific and which are system-wide.
