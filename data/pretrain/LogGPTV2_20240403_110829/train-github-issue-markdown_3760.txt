### What problem does this feature solve?
example:  
[div > SomeComponent > large children DOM]
Often we don't need SomeComponent features in some cases, just children -
slot. And then we use v-if for it with v-else and duplicate a lot of child
code. Also, we can use a prop like 'disabled' for SomeComponent, but still,
component initializing anyway what impact performance. It is useful for
Tooltips, Wrappers, etc.
Right now it is possible to implement with render-functions, but it is very
complicated and inconvenient.
### What does the proposed API look like?
My request is to add directive like 'v-if-only' which mean whether this
component will render or just default scope slot.
