### Displaying ETH-DM Statistics

#### Purpose
Display the Ethernet Delay Measurement (ETH-DM) statistics.

#### Action
To display the ETH-DM statistics collected for MEPs belonging to a specific Maintenance Association (MA) and within a specific Maintenance Domain (MD), use the following command:

```shell
user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management delay-statistics maintenance-domain md1 maintenance-association ma1
```

#### See Also
- `show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management delay-statistics`

### Clearing Continuity Measurement Statistics

#### Purpose
Clear the continuity measurement statistics.

By default, statistics are deleted for all MEPs attached to CFM-enabled interfaces on the router. You can filter the scope of the command by specifying an interface name.

#### Action
To clear the continuity measurement statistics for all MEPs attached to CFM-enabled interfaces on the router:

```shell
user@host> clear oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management continuity-measurement maintenance-domain md-name maintenance-association ma-name local-mep local-mep-id remote-mep remote-mep-id
```

### Viewing Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements Statistics

Once Ethernet frame delay measurement statistics have been collected, they can be displayed. Two types of `show` commands are provided:

1. **For all OAM frame counters and Ethernet frame delay measurement statistics:**
   ```shell
   user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-statistics maintenance-domain name maintenance-association name [local-mep identifier] [remote-mep identifier] [count count]
   ```

2. **For Ethernet frame delay measurement statistics only:**
   ```shell
   user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management delay-statistics maintenance-domain name maintenance-association name [local-mep identifier] [remote-mep identifier] [count count]
   ```

#### Note
The only difference between the two commands is the use of the `mep-statistics` and `delay-statistics` keywords.

  ```

### Configuring Ethernet Frame Delay Measurements

Ethernet frame delay measurement is a useful tool for providing performance statistics or supporting Service Level Agreements (SLAs). By default, Ethernet frame delay measurement uses software for timestamping and delay calculations. You can optionally use hardware timing to assist in this process and increase the accuracy of the delay measurement results. This assistance is available on the reception path.

Before performing Ethernet frame delay measurements on MX Series routers, ensure the following:
- Correctly configured Ethernet OAM and CFM
- Prepared the measurement between two compatibly configured MX Series routers
- Enabled the distributed periodic packet management daemon (PPMD)
- Avoided aggregated Ethernet or pseudowire interfaces, which are not supported
- Ensured hardware-assisted timestamping is supported if configured

#### To configure hardware-assisted timestamping:

1. Enable Ethernet frame delay measurement hardware assistance on the reception path by including the `hardware-assisted-timestamping` statement at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]` hierarchy level:
   ```shell
   [edit]
   protocols {
       oam {
           ethernet {
               connectivity-fault-management {
                   performance-monitoring {
                       hardware-assisted-timestamping; # Enable timestamping in hardware.
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure distributed PPMD is enabled. Without distributed PPMD, delay measurement results are not valid. Make sure the following configuration statement is NOT present:
   ```shell
   [edit routing-options]
   ppm {
       no-delegate-processing; # This turns distributed PPMD OFF.
   }
   ```

### Configuring Statistical Frame Loss Measurement for VPLS Connections

Using proactive statistical frame loss measurement, you can monitor VPLS connections on MX Series routers. Statistical frame loss measurement allows you to monitor the quality of Ethernet connections for service level agreements (SLAs). Point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint connections configured on MX Series routers can be monitored by registering the connection on an iterator and initiating periodic SLA measurement of frame transmissions on the connections.

Iterators periodically transmit SLA measurement packets using ITU-Y.1731 compliant frames. The iterator sends periodic measurement packets for each of the connections registered to it. These measurement cycles are transmitted in such a way as to not overlap, reducing the processing demands placed on the CPU. The measurement packets are exchanged between the source UNI port and the destination UNI port, providing a sequence of timed performance measurements for each UNI pair. The Frame Loss Ratio (FLR) and connection availability can be computed from these measurements using statistics.

#### Steps to Configure Statistical Frame Loss Measurement for VPLS Connections:

1. To configure proactive ETH-DM measurement for a VPLS connection, see "Guidelines for Configuring Routers to Support an ETH-DM Session" on page 224.
2. To enable statistical loss measurement for a VPLS connection, configure an iterator for the VPLS connection using the `sla-iterator-profiles` statement at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]` hierarchy level. For detailed instructions, see "Configuring an Iterator Profile" on page 306.
3. As part of the iterator configuration, include the `statistical-frame-loss` option for the `measurement-type` statement at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles profile-name]` hierarchy level.
4. Once you have enabled the iterator, you can display the statistical frame loss for a VPLS connection by issuing the following command:
   ```shell
   user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management sla-iterator-statistics sla-iterator identifier maintenance-domain name maintenance-association name local-mep identifier remote-mep identifier
   ```
