User: The subprocess module says that you can pass STDOUT to the stderr argument to get the standard error redirected to the standard out file handle.  However, there is no STDERR constant.  Is there a way to go the other way?  I want everything on stderr and stdout to be redirected to the stderr of the parent process.
Assistant: You can pass in any file descriptor or file object. So use sys.stderr.
