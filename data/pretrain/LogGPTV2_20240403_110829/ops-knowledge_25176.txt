If you donâ€™t want to enter a password, you can use the key for authentication . 4. Remote management server: After successfully connecting to the remote server, you can execute various commands in the terminal to perform remote management operations, such as viewing files, modifying permissions, installing software, etc. Operations such as remote file transfer and remote debugging can also be performed on the local computer.
