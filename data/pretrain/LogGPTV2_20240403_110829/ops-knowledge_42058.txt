User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Server 2012 foundation not asking for user login I am having a problem with a Windows Server 2012 Foundation Computer. It's a new server which I have just set up. For some reason, which is not clear to me, the server is not requiring computers on the same LAN as the server to log in to access server drives. 

Based on past experience, Windows Server (in fact all windows machines) require users to have an account and log in before accessing network (shared) resources. Not this one. I set up a couple of network shares and anyone connected to the network can use them. Remote Desktop users still have to log in, but not locally connected users.

It's a new server. I have simply set it up as a Domain Controller - that's it. I had a look at Group Policy Editor, but couldn't figure out how to do anything there to fix the problem. Any input welcome. I am baffled by this one.

Assistant: Windows 2012 Foundation does not require password when the party accessing the network shared resources is in the same domain as the server.
