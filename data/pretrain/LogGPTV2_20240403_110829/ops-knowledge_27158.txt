Question: Considering the vulnerabilities inherent in the TCP/IP protocol, particularly in relation to forged IP source addresses, which of the following measures could potentially harden TCP against such attacks? Select all that apply.
"A": "Implement packet filtering at ISP level to block packets with obviously forged IP source addresses.",
"B": "Increase the randomness in the selection of TCP initial sequence numbers (ISNs) beyond just low-order bits.",
"C": "Adopt a uniform increment for the initial sequence number (ISN) after each new connection to improve predictability.",
"D": "Utilize a per-connection ISN scheme using a cryptographic hash function with a secret and connection-specific values."
