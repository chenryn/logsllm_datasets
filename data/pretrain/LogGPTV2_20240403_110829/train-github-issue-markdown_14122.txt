As with today's command line or powershell, it is possible to go to the
address bar in the file explorer and type 'cmd' or 'powershell' and it would
open in the current directory location.
  1. This feature request is about allowing the same behavior by typing 'terminal' - which will open the terminal with the default profile in the directory location.
  2. In addition please also allow a context menu entry for terminal that would also open the default profile in the current directory.
