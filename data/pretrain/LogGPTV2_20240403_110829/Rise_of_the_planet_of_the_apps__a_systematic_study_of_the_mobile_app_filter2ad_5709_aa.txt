## Abstract

Mobile application stores have gained significant popularity due to the evolution of the smartphone app market and the large increase in smartphone users. Besides official marketplaces like Google’s Android Market and Apple’s App Store, there are numerous alternative app stores with a large number of applications and users.

In this thesis, we perform a systematic study on four third-party Android marketplaces to better understand various aspects of this rapidly evolving ecosystem. Specifically, we investigate:
1. How apps are produced and common strategies among app developers.
2. The pattern of app popularity.
3. User download patterns and how they are influenced by recommendation systems.
4. How app pricing affects app popularity and developer income.

We compare our findings with similar studies in other fields, such as the World Wide Web (WWW), peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems, and user-generated content (UGC) sites.

The data for our analysis were gathered by systematically crawling four popular Android app stores on a daily basis over several months. Our results indicate that mobile marketplaces are dominated by a small number of very popular applications, confirming the Pareto Principle. The distribution of app popularity follows a Zipf-like behavior with some deviations, similar to the behavior observed in P2P and UGC workloads. We verify that these deviations from the Zipf distribution are partly due to the "fetch-at-most-once" user behavior, as demonstrated by other studies, and by a phenomenon we call the clustering effect. According to the clustering effect, apps are grouped into clusters, which may be a result of recommendation systems, user communities, or other grouping forces, and users tend to download apps from the same clusters with higher probability. We validate our app clustering hypothesis using a new metric called "user temporal affinity" to app categories, measured using a dataset with user comments, which implies user downloads. The results show that users indeed have a strong affinity to app categories. We then propose a novel model based on the clustering effect and fetch-at-most-once property, and evaluate it through a simulation-based study comparing it with the observed app downloads. Our model approximates the actual distribution of app downloads very well.

## Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Evangelos Markatos, for his guidance throughout my graduate studies. I am honored to have worked with someone of his intellectual and ethical caliber.

Special thanks to Spiros Antonatos, who helped me take my first steps in the world of research and provided opportunities to work on interesting projects.

I am grateful to Antonis Papadogiannakis for his invaluable help and the joyful moments we shared while working together. I also thank Thomas Karagiannis (Microsoft Research) and Michalis Polychronakis (Columbia University) for their constructive comments and suggestions, which were crucial for the progress of this thesis. Daniel Song (Columbia University) implemented the prototypes of the Chinese Android Market crawlers, and I greatly appreciate his support.

I am also thankful to Dr. Sotiris Ioannidis for his advice and support. Many thanks to all the members of the DCS (Distributed Computing Systems) Lab at FORTH-ICS, including Demetris Antoniades, Iasonas Polakis, Elias Athanasopoulos, Giorgos Vasiliadis, Alexandros Kapravelos, Andreas Sfakianakis, Giorgos Kontaxis, Eleni Gessiou, Spiros Ligouras, Nikos Tsikoudis, Lazaros Koromilas, Panagiotis Papadopoulos, Antonis Papaioannou, Giorgos Chinis, Harris Papadakis, Christos Papachristos, Antonis Krithinakis, Manolis Stamatogiannakis, and Melitini Christodoulaki, as well as non-DCS members Giorgos Saloustros and Panagiotis Garafalakis, for contributing to a pleasant and productive environment.

A big shout out to my friends Elias (Endov Lane) Panagiotopoulos, Manolis Stylianakakis, Aris Tzermias, Leonidas Groneberg, Giorgos Grigoreas, Giorgos Sykiotakis, Giannis Theoharis, Elias Kouroudis, Nikos Dritsos, Manolis Kounalas, and many others, for their constant encouragement and support.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank my family: my brother Manolis, my sister Dimitra, my grandmother Dimitra, my father Giorgos, and especially my mother Anna, for their unwavering support, encouragement, and patience.

Finally, I would not have made it through without Anna Maria Wateroil. I thank her for all the love and understanding (kouu!).
