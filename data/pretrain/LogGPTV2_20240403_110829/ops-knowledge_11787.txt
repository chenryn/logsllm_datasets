### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:09:46 to 18:09:51 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues within a Hadoop environment. The key points are:

1. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Errors**:
   - Multiple attempts to contact the RM (Resource Manager) at `msra-sa-41:8030` failed, with the following error message: "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."
   - The system is retrying the connection to the RM, with a retry policy of up to 10 retries and a fixed sleep time of 1 second between each attempt.

2. **Address Change Detection**:
   - There are frequent address changes detected for both the RM and the lease renewer. The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:port`. This change is observed for ports 8030 and 9000.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The lease renewer, identified as `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, is unable to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The lease renewal failures occur at increasing intervals: 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, and 294 seconds.
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Components**:
  - The logs are timestamped from 18:09:46 to 18:09:51.
  - The relevant software components include `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`, `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`, and `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`.

- **Error and Warning Messages**:
  - **Error in Contacting RM**: 
    - Occurs at 18:09:46, 18:09:48, and 18:09:50.
    - Indicates a failure to communicate with the RM.
  - **Address Change Detected**:
    - For the RM: 
      - 18:09:47, 18:09:49, and 18:09:51.
      - Old: `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, New: `msra-sa-41:8030`.
    - For the lease renewer:
      - 18:09:46, 18:09:47, 18:09:48, 18:09:49, 18:09:50, and 18:09:51.
      - Old: `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, New: `msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - **Failed to Renew Lease**:
    - 18:09:46, 18:09:47, 18:09:48, 18:09:49, 18:09:50, and 18:09:51.
    - Duration of failure increases by one second each time (289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294 seconds).

- **Retry Attempts**:
  - The system is attempting to reconnect to the RM at `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of up to 10 retries and a 1-second sleep interval between each attempt.
  - The lease renewer also indicates it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with RM communication and lease renewal, likely due to address changes and network instability. The system is actively retrying connections and lease renewals, but these attempts are failing. Further investigation into the network configuration and RM availability is recommended to resolve these issues.
