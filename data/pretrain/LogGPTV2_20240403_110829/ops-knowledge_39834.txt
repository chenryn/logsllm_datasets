User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MySQL Clustering and replication I want to setup a MySQL cluster setup of two servers (M1-M2). I also want to setup MySQL replication between two servers (M1-M3).

Is it possible to setup both clustering and replication as above. Is it a good idea to have a setup like this ?

I want to have server M1 and M2 in the amazon cloud and other server M3 in our datacenter.

Assistant: This should be quite possible.  MySQL cluster uses the NDB (Network Database) engine to "replicate" changes between the two nodes.  So it does not use the binary logs at all.  You can therefore setup the other server M3 to do straight binary log replication.  

You could theoretically use whatever engine you wanted for M3, but beware that certain DML and most DDL will fail for certain engines (or at least behave differently).  So the most robust would be to have M3 be a single node NDB instance.  But you could set it up to use MyISAM or InnoDB, just realize that it could lead to issues down the road...

As for if it is a good idea, that depends.  As long as the M1 -> M3 replication is a Master-Slave relationship (with M3 being the slave), I don't see the harm in that...
