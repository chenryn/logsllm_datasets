## Reversing Attribute Costs

To determine the cost of card attributes, we used the following coefficients:
- Attack (Atk) = 1
- Health (Health) = -1
- Charge (Charge) = 2
- Divine Shield (Divine) = 1
- Intrinsic Value (Intrinsic) = 1

**Example Calculation:**
- For a card with 4 Attack, 2 Health, 1 Charge, 1 Divine, and 1 Intrinsic:
  \[
  4 \times 1 + 2 \times (-1) + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 6
  \]
- For a card with 1 Attack, 1 Health, 1 Divine, and 1 Intrinsic:
  \[
  1 \times 1 + 1 \times (-1) + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 2
  \]

**Note:** These example attribute costs are illustrative and may not be accurate due to the limited number of cards used.

## Finding Card Real Price Using Reversed Coefficients

- **Card with 4 Attack, 2 Health, 1 Charge, 1 Divine, and 1 Intrinsic:**
  \[
  4 \times 1 + 2 \times (-1) + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 6
  \]
- **Card with 1 Attack, 1 Health, 1 Divine, and 1 Intrinsic:**
  \[
  1 \times 1 + 1 \times (-1) + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 = 2
  \]

**Conclusion:** The second card is undervalued based on the calculated real price.

## Modeling Dependence Between Characteristics

- **Charge** = Attack * Charge Coefficient
- **Windfury** = Attack * Windfury Coefficient
- **Divine Shield** = ? (potentially related to Health)

**Model also uses a card budget:**
\[
2 \times \text{Mana} + 1
\]

## Reversed Budget Coefficients

| Effect | Cost per Point |
|--------|----------------|
| Destroy Minion | 10.63 |
| Board Damage | 3.69 |
| Draw Card | 3.68 |
| Divine Shield | 2.74 |
| Freeze | 2.04 |
| Silence | 1.66 |
| Damage | 1.64 |
| Durability | 1.22 |
| Stealth | 1.21 |
| Attack | 1.14 |
| Taunt | 1.02 |
| WindFury | 0.96 |
| SpellPower | 0.93 |
| Health | 0.81 |
| Battlecry Heal | 0.69 |
| Battlecry Self Hero Heal | 0.68 |
| Charge | 0.65 |
| Intrinsic Value | 0.32 |

| Effect | Cost per Point |
|--------|----------------|
| Opponent Draw Card | -3.97 |
| Discard Cards | -2.67 |
| Overload | -1.68 |
| Self Hero Damage | -0.54 |

**Note:** 2 coefficient points are approximately equivalent to 1 mana point.

## Cost Estimation vs. Blizzard's Mana Cost

- **Cost Estimated by the Algorithm (in Mana):** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- **Cost Assigned by Blizzard (in Mana):** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

**Undervalued Cards:**
- The model identified several clearly undervalued cards.

**Overpriced Cards:**
- The model also identified overpriced cards.

## Most Undervalued Cards

- **~130 cards** were found to be undervalued.

## Taking It to the Next Level

- **Data Collection:**
  - 100,000 games from May to June
  - Thanks to â€¦ for providing the data
  - A longer-term solution is needed for game replays

- **Pricing Cards with Unique Effects:**
  - Further analysis is required for cards with unique effects.

## Cards in Hand

| Health | Real Value |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | 1.3        |
| 2      | 1.9        |
| 3      | 2.5        |
| 4      | 3.0        |
| 5      | 3.6        |
| 6      | 4.1        |
| 7      | 4.7        |
| 8      | 5.3        |
| 9      | 5.9        |

**Categories:**
- **Overpriced:** 1.3, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2
- **Fair:** 4.1, 5.3
- **Undervalued:** 5.9

**Twilight Drake Example:**
- **Average Real Value:** 3.7
- **Drake Health:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Number of Twilight Drakes Made:**
  - 0
  - 500
  - 1000
  - 1500
  - 2000
  - 2500

**Conclusion:**
- The price of Twilight Drake is fair.

**Final Note:**
- **Et voila!**
