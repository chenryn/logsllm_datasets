User: I have to run a a list of Python jobs one by one after the successful completion of  each job.
How can I accomplish this in development environment, I know I can use a scheduler in production environment?
FOr example:
module1.py
module2.py
module3.py
module4.py
module5.py
I need to run module1.py then after its successful completion need to trigger module2, then module3..
I have heard of CRON scheduler, Can I install it in windows environment and set it up?
Also, Im on windows environment and use Pydev to develop my applications.
Assistant: If you want to set the cron in windows task scheduler is there ,before that write batch file write all commands to run python programs one by one and put it for task scheduler, 
It works
