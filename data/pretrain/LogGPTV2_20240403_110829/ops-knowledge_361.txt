User: Please write a Python script to detect whether a host in the network is online.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that uses the ping command to detect whether a host in the network is online: ```python import os def ping(host): response = os.system("ping -c 1 " + host) if response == 0: print(host, 'is up!') else: print(host, 'is down.') hosts = ["127.0.0.1", "google.com", "192.168.1.1"] for host in hosts: ping(host) ``` The output is similar to: ``` 127.0.0.1 is up! google.com is up! 192.168.1.1 is down. ``` where ``os.system("ping -c 1 " + host)``Execute the ping command and return the result in the response variable. If the return value is 0, it means the host is online normally; otherwise it is 1 or other values, it means the host is not online.
