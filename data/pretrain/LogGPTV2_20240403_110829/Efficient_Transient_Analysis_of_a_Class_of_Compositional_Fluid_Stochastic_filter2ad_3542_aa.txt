Abstract—Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets (FSPNs) which have
discrete and continuous places are an established model class
to describe and analyze several dependability problems for
computer systems, software architectures or critical infrastruc-
tures. Unfortunately, their analysis is faced with the curse of
dimensionality resulting in very large systems of differential
equations for a sufﬁciently accurate analysis. This contribution
introduces a class of FSPNs with a compositional structure and
shows how the underlying stochastic process can be described
by a set of coupled partial differential equations. Using semi
discretization, a set of linear ordinary differential equations is
generated which can be described by a (hierarchical) sum of
Kronecker products. Based on this compact representation of
the transition matrix, a numerical solution approach is applied
which also represents transient solution vectors in compact form
using the recently developed concept of a Hierarchical Tucker
Decomposition. The applicability of the approach is presented
in a case study analyzing a degrading software system with
rejuvenation, restart, and replication.

I. INTRODUCTION
Stochastic models including discrete and continuous state
variables are an important modeling framework for perfor-
mance and dependability analysis beyond pure discrete state
discrete event systems. Continuous variables are used to
abstract from a large number of discrete entities [2] or to
describe some continuous physical quantity such as the ﬁlling
of a battery or a tank [13], [24]. Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets
(FSPNs) which have discrete and continuous places are a
model class that combines the advantages of Petri Nets with
the possibility to specify hybrid stochastic systems. Several
classes of hybrid Petri Nets have been deﬁned, which differ in
various details. We consider here FSPNs [18] in an extended
version with ﬂush-out arcs and marking dependent rates [16].
Although FSPNs are known for some time and have even
been extended to allow a compositional description of systems
[1], [15], the analysis is often restricted to relatively simple
models with constant ﬂow rates. One has two general pos-
sibilities to analyze an FSPN, hybrid stochastic simulation
or the numerical solution of the set of partial differential
equations (PDEs) described by the FSPN. As for discrete
state models, numerical analysis has the advantage of pro-
viding more accurate results, in particular, if the evolution
of the system behavior over some time interval has to be
analyzed, as it is necessary for many problems. However,
numerical analysis is faced with the problem of state space
explosion which limits the applicability of the approach to
relatively small models. Stochastic simulation, in principle
can be applied to arbitrary models, but it should be remarked
that simulation of FSPNs has to combine the analysis of the
continuous evolution of the ﬂuid part, which has to be analyzed
by some form of discretization, and marking dependent ﬁring
rates of transitions, resulting in a non-homogeneous behavior
according to the discrete part. This implies that available
simulators cannot handle general FSPNs and simulation can
be time consuming [8]. To the best of our knowledge, only
prototype simulators are available for FSPNs which allow only
the analysis of restricted classes of models. Apart from the
speciﬁc problems of simulating FSPNs, the determination of
the transient behavior of stochastic models over an interval
of time often results in large conﬁdence intervals because
estimators are dependent over a time series.
We consider in this paper the numerical analysis of FSPNs
and try to alleviate the problem of state space explosion. Two
steps are introduced for this purpose. First, we introduce a
class of compositional FSPNs which allow one to specify
models by the composition of small components and use
the component structure to deﬁne a multi-dimensional state
space. For analysis, the ﬂuid part has to be discretized which
often results in a large discrete state space with very regular
structure. The transition matrix of the discretized system of
equations is presented by a block structured matrix where
each submatrix results from the Kronecker product of small
component matrices. The composition and the resulting matrix
structure is more general
than the one proposed in [15].
This ﬁrst step results in a very compact representation of
the transition matrix which can be used in iterative numerical
techniques as done for discrete state Markov models for some
time [9]. However, this step is usually not sufﬁcient to analyze
very large models because solution vectors still have lengths
equal to the size of the state space. For analyzing very large
models, a second step is necessary to represent solution vectors
in a more compact way which usually implies the introduction
of an approximation. For this purpose, recently developed data

structures for higher dimensional tensors can be used [17]. We
use a Hierarchical Tucker Decomposition (HTD) which has
already been applied for the analysis of PDEs [20] and for the
stationary analysis of Markov chains [5]. Here we extend the
approaches to the transient analysis of FSPNs.
The new contributions of the paper are a compositional class
of FSPNs, the compact representation of the transition matrix
after spatial discretization,
the integration of the compact
matrix structure and the HTD data structure for vectors in nu-
merical solvers for transient analysis, a full C-implementation
of the approach to obtain numerical results, and the application
of the method to an example from software dependability. The
presented solution methods can also be applied to discrete state
Markov models, but they are especially well suited to analyze
hybrid systems due to the regular structure of the discrete state
space after spatial discretization.
In the next section, we ﬁrst present the class of FSPNs.
In Section III, the stochastic process resulting from spatial
discretization is introduced. Then, in Section IV, transient
numerical analysis and the HTD data structure for vectors
are introduced. Section V includes the application example.
The paper ends with the conclusions and a short outlook on
possible extensions.

transition rates of timed transitions in each marking;
transitions has the usual meaning;
continuous places;
For transition t, we deﬁne the sets of discrete input and
output places •t = {p ∈ Pd | Ad(p, t) > 0} and t• =
{p ∈ Pd | Ad(t, p) > 0},
the sets of continuous input
and output places ◦t = {p ∈ Pc | Ac(p, t) = 1} and
t◦ = {p ∈ Pc | Ac(t, p) = 1}, and the set of places
connected by a ﬂush-out arc (cid:7)t = {p ∈ P | Af (p, t) = 1}.
Note that in our setting, ﬂushing out of places by immediate
transitions is also possible. The input and output transitions of
places (discrete or continuous) •p and p• are deﬁned similarly.
Furthermore, p(cid:7) for p ∈ P is the set of transitions connected
via a ﬂush-out arc. The notation can be naturally extended to
sets of places or transitions.
The dynamic behavior of FSPNs will only be brieﬂy intro-
duced here; details can be found in the above mentioned papers
(e.g., in [16], [18]). Observe that the enabling of transitions
only depends on the discrete marking. That is, transition t ∈ T
is enabled in marking M = (m, x) ∈ M if for all p ∈ Pd,
we have Ad(p, t) ≤ mp .
We let E(m) denote the set of all enabled transitions in
discrete marking m ∈ Md. If immediate transitions are
enabled, they have priority over timed transitions, i.e., timed
transitions ﬁre if E(m) ∩ Ti = ∅. If transition t ∈ T ﬁres
in marking M ∈ M, then the new marking M
, x(cid:2))
p = mp − Ad(p, t) + Ad(t, p) and x(cid:2) = ˆx,
is given by m(cid:2)
where ˆxp = 0 if p ∈ (cid:7)t and ˆxp = xp if p /∈ (cid:7)t. The ﬁring
of a transition ﬂushes out all the places that are connected
with ﬂush-out arcs to t. We denote this as m t→ m(cid:2). Firing
times of timed transitions are exponentially distributed with
rates F (t, M ). Marking dependent transition rates are very
powerful, if they are applied in full generality, because they
may be used to set the rate of an enabled transition to zero
and can thus simulate inhibitor arcs.
For continuous place pc ∈ Pc and marking M ∈ M, the
potential change rate of the ﬂuid level for all timed transitions
t ∈ E(M ) is given by
ˆrc(M ) =
R((t, pc), M )−

R((pc, t), M ).

The potential ﬂow does not consider the bounds of ﬂuid places
which are 0 and B(pc). Now, let M (τ ) ∈ M be the marking
at time τ ≥ 0. The actual change of the ﬂuid in continuous
place pc ∈ Pc is then given by

4) Each subnet contains at most one continuous place such
that the local state can be expressed as (m(j), x(j)),
where x(j) is the ﬁlling of the local continuous place
and x(j) is omitted if subnet j contains no continuous
place. If the subnet contains no discrete place, m(j) is
omitted.

respectively. We assume that the ﬂuid upper bounds of the
continuous places c1 and c2 are normalized to 1. For the
transitions tfi, we assume a ﬁring rate of 1, which is only
relevant as a scaling factor since the transitions are always
enabled and the ﬁring does not modify the discrete marking.
Transitions tfi ﬁll the adjacent continuous place ci with ﬂuid.

where j (cid:14)= i, j = 1, 2.

We consider a compositional approach to describe and
analyze FSPNs. Compositional analysis of discrete Petri nets
without continuous places is known for several decades. A well
known class are superposed SPNs and GSPNs [11], [12]. For
FSPNs, compositional approaches have been proposed in [1],
[15]. Although these papers are the ﬁrst to introduce ideas to
represent the transition rate matrix of the discretized stochastic
process in a compact form using Kronecker products, they do
not exploit the resulting structure for a numerical analysis.
A superposed FSPN (SFSPN) is an FSPN in which the
set of places is partitioned into disjoint subsets P (j) (j =
1, . . . , J). Then every marking M ∈ M can be represented as
(M (1), . . . , M (J)), where M (j) considers only the places in
P (j). This partition naturally deﬁnes sets of transitions for
subnets. Transition t belongs to subnet j if t ∈ •P (j) ∪
P (j) • ∪P (j)(cid:7) and it
to subnet j if additionally
t /∈ (•P (i) ∪ P (i) • ∪P (i)(cid:7)) for all i (cid:14)= j and the rate of the
transition depends only on the marking of places from P (j).
Now, let T (j) be the set of transitions belonging to subnet j.
Then (P (j),T (j), M
0 ,A(j), B(j), W (j), F (j), R(j)) deﬁnes a
subnet, where the functions are restricted to the subsets P (j)
and T (j). A subnet only acts independently of its environment
