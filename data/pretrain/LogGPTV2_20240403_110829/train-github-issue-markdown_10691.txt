Desktop application (swing client) is executed via web start. While
application context is instantiated application performs many (122 times) http
get requests for resources which don't exist. This of course has huge impact
on time that is needed to application startup based on you network connection.
Here is a sample of access log (each entry is requested multiple times which
in total for one time application execution gives 122 requests to the server):  
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:24 +0100] "GET /neo-
web/webstart/org.springframework.aspects.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-"
"Java/1.7.0_03"  
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:28 +0100] "GET /neo-
web/webstart/org.springframework.beans.jar HTTP/1.1" 404 952 "-"

127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:31 +0100] "GET /neo-

127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2012:15:07:51 +0100] "GET /neo-

This is reproducible every time application is executed via webstart (javaws
http://localhost:8080/neo-web/webstart/launch.jnlp). It can be reproduced only
in java web start environment because there is JNLPClassLoader involved which
indirectly causes jars lookup on the backend server.
I enclosed stacktraces on which you can see class lookups and then calls to
the servers. In stacktrace2 - stacktrace3 I noted parameter which was used in
method invocation JNLPClassLoader  
JNLPClassLoader(ClassLoader).loadClass(String) line: 356 
The stacktrace1 is different than stacktraces 2-5 as the source of class
loading is different. The latter (2-5) are pretty the same for most calls to
the server (they differ only with different classes to be loaded)
