### 0x00 Preface
On April 30, 2018, `vpnMentor` disclosed two high-risk vulnerabilities in the `GPON` router: Validation Bypass (CVE-2018-10561) and Command Injection (CVE-2018-10562). These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the `GPON Router` with a single request. This paper analyzes the root causes of these vulnerabilities and their recurrence.

### 0x01 Vulnerability File Location
To pinpoint the remote command execution vulnerability, the `ps` command can be used. The process ID (PID) 14650 is observed to have executed our command, and the preceding process is `14649 root /bin/WebMgr -p 20 -s 0`. Given that PIDs are incremented, it is likely that the `/bin/WebMgr` file contains the vulnerability.

### 0x02 Vulnerability Analysis
After obtaining the `/bin/WebMgr` and `/lib/` files from the device, we began our analysis.

#### 2.1 Preliminary Analysis
Before diving into the detailed analysis, we investigated how the vulnerability was exploited. We identified the web server as `GoAhead-webs`, and according to the `Server` field, the version of the web server is known.

#### 2.2 Exploitation Details
The exploitation of this vulnerability involves the following steps:
1. The `Seebug` vulnerability platform has documented this vulnerability.
2. Results from the `ZoomEye` cyberspace search engine provide additional context.
