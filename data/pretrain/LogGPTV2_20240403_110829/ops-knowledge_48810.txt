User: How to forward HTTP traffic to multiple backend servers via Nginx?
Assistant: To forward HTTP traffic to multiple backend servers via Nginx, follow these steps: 1. Make sure you have Nginx installed and your virtual hosts configured properly. 2. Open your Nginx configuration file. 3. Add an upstream block inside the http block, specifying your list of backend servers. For example: ``` http { upstream backends { server 192.168.1.1:8080; server 192.168.1.2:8080; } } ``` Here we specify two servers: port 8080 of 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2. 4. In your server block, use the proxy_pass directive to forward the request to the list of servers defined in upstream. For example: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backends; } } ``` This will send all requests to the list of servers defined in the upstream block. 5. Restart the Nginx service. Now your Nginx server will choose an available server from the upstream block and forward all requests to it. If that server is unavailable, Nginx chooses the next server until it finds an available one.
