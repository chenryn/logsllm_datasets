I'm currently using IDLE, which is decent, but I would like to know if there are better lightweight Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) specifically designed for Mac—whether they are free or commercial.

**Response:**

You might want to check out Sublime Text. It's highly regarded for its speed and efficiency, and it works exceptionally well on Mac. While the current stable version is Sublime Text 4, the alpha version of Sublime Text 2 was also quite impressive in its time. Sublime Text offers a wide range of features, including a powerful search function, a distraction-free mode, and extensive customization options through plugins. Additionally, you can try other lightweight IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, which is free and has excellent support for Python development, or PyCharm Community Edition, which is also free and specifically tailored for Python. Both of these alternatives are highly rated and have strong community support.
