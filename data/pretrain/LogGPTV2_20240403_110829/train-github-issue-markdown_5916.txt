Feedback Hub (I tried to find a UWP app that follows the enable coloured title
bars setting. lol you can see the bug where here is a massive gap next to the
back button. and that missing top 1px border. rip testers.):

This happens to a bunch of win32 apps. The icons of the caption buttons are
also positioned slightly differently between UWP apps and apps like Chromium,
which doesn't have a pre-windows 10 sized titlebar when maximised. This may be
a Project Reunion issue or a duplicate. Oh and I noticed that the navigation
pane in powertoys is darker than other apps
