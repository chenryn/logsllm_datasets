User: Please use the Shell script to realize the batch file cleaning function in the Linux system.
Assistant: The following is a simple implementation: ```bash #!/bin/bash # Define the directory and file type to be cleaned clean_path="/path/to/clean" clean_file_ext=".log .txt .bak" # Enter to be cleaned Directory cd $clean_path # traverse the file types to be cleaned and delete for ext in $clean_file_ext; do find . -type f -name "*$ext" -exec rm -f {} \; done echo "The file is cleaned up." `` ` The script first defines the directory and file types to be cleaned, and then enters the directory through the `cd` command. Next, use the `find` command to find files matching the specified file type and call the `rm` command to remove them. Finally, output the completion message. You can save the script as a file and give it permission to execute, and then run it regularly through a scheduled task to realize the automatic batch file cleaning function.
