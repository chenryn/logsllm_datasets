I was getting a problem where the only lighting affecting the json model, with
its default phong shading, was ambient.
I believe the issue was the bump scale array as changing this to a value to
not an array ie 1.0 fixed the issue for me...  
`"mapBumpScale":[10.0,10.0]`
Is this a new feature for bump map materials that we are be able to adjust x
and y offset?...and for what version is this compatible with?
