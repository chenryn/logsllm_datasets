User: This will not be a "programming" question but more technology / platform related question. I'm trying to figure out whether Python can be a suitable Java alternative for enterprise / web applications. 
Which are the ideal cases where you would prefer to use Python instead of Java? How would a typical Python web application (databases/sessions/concurrency) perform as compared to a typical Java application? How do specific Python frameworks square up against Java based frameworks (Spring, SEAM, Grails etc.)?
For businesses, switching from the Java infrastructure to a Python infrastructure .. is it too hard/expensive/resource intensive/not viable? Also shed some light on the business case for providing a Python + Google AppEngine based solution to the end customer. Will it be cost effective in an typical scenario?
Sorry if I am asking too wide a question, I would have liked to keep it specific, but I need your help to evaluate Python as a whole from the perspectives of the programmers, service providing company and end business customer.
For an SME, a Python/GoogleAppEngine based technology stack is a clear scalable and affordable platform. But what about a large MNC that already has a lot invested in Java.
Thank you so much. I am researching this myself and will gladly share my conclusions here!
Thank you,

Assistant: The answer to your question is yes. Python can be well suited for Enterprise because python is a language which has raw power, flexible and can be glued with other programming languages. What enterprise really requires is a language which does everything and i feel python is already enterprise ready. If you want examples then i believe there can be no bigger example than google. Google is running python internally and externally for its business critical applications. The only problem with python is that it is not very well recognized by top MNC company and we as a python programmer find hard time convincing the management team. I guess you will face the same issue. But i guarantee you once you get your feet wet in python, you will understand its true power
