User: How to configure nginx reverse proxy service? Please provide a concrete configuration example.
Assistant: The following is an example Nginx reverse proxy configuration: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` In this example, when a user visits example.com, Nginx will proxy the web server and forward the HTTP request to the local port 8080. The proxy_set_header directive is used to set HTTP request header information. Also, you need to do other configurations according to your own needs. For example, if you want Nginx to use HTTPS, you need to add directives such as SSL certificate and key in the server block.
