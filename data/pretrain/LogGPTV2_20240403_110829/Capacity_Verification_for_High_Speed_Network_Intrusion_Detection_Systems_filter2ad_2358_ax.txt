### Threat Activity and Technological Advances

Technological advancements and the Internet have expanded opportunities for criminal activities. Consequently, law enforcement agencies face numerous new challenges, particularly in building the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively combat cybercrimes. A significant part of this knowledge can be derived from open sources, including the interception and examination of network communications as a source of criminal intelligence. Interception is also used to collect evidence of criminal offenses to support prosecution efforts. The use of cyber-based evidence, such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs, is becoming increasingly important.

While the collection of evidence to support criminal prosecution has traditionally been a law enforcement responsibility, Security and Intelligence (S&I) agencies are now being tasked with supporting law enforcement, especially in anti-terrorism efforts. Specific legislation governs the interception activities of S&I and law enforcement agencies, with several conditions that must be met before an interception authorization can be granted and while conducting the interception. These conditions are typically outlined in relevant legislation, such as the CSIS Act or criminal and anti-terrorism laws.

### Interception and Legal Frameworks

Other public and private sector organizations may also need to intercept and examine network traffic, often for intelligence or evidentiary purposes. However, most such interceptions are conducted by law enforcement or S&I agencies. In other cases, organizations perform interception to identify attempted or actual intrusions into protected systems or networks and to initiate incident response processes. While existing legal regimes adequately address interception by S&I and law enforcement agencies, they generally do not cover the interception of network traffic by other organizations.

### Definition of Private Communications

What constitutes a private communication, especially over a network, for the purposes of criminal or anti-terrorism law? The Criminal Code of Canada defines a private communication as "any oral communication or telecommunication made under circumstances in which it is reasonable for the originator to expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than the intended recipient." Telecommunications include the emission, transmission, or reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, or intelligence of any nature by wire, cable, radio, optical, or other electromagnetic systems. Network communications would likely fall within this definition.

### Personal Information and Privacy

It is useful to distinguish between personal information that is public and that which is private. Personal information is defined as information about an identifiable individual recorded in any form, including identifying numbers, symbols, or addresses. Personal information can be very broad and includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Some personal information, such as financial or medical data, should be considered private, while other information, like names and phone numbers in a phone book, is generally public. In a network context, user names and domain (e-mail) addresses, as published in public key certificates, are likely considered public information.

### Content and Header Information

The issue of keeping the content of a particular communication private is straightforward: if the originator does not want the contents of the message to be read by anyone other than the intended recipient, they can use encryption. Criminal law specifically mentions the electronic or other treatment of radio-based communication to prevent intelligible reception by unauthorized persons. For network communications, taking steps to protect the communication against interception would create a reasonable expectation of privacy for the content.

However, the situation is less clear for packet header information. Headers, which include destination addresses and URLs, are generated in response to user input and can be considered private. On the other hand, routing and handling information in packet headers must be public to facilitate communication. Simply intercepting the fact of a communication (traffic data) can lead to detailed user profiles, even if the data is considered public. Traffic data, which includes IP addresses, is essential for network communication but raises privacy concerns.

### Legal Implications for IDS

There seems to be an effort in certain legislation to distinguish between traffic data and content. For example, the Council of Europe (COE) Convention on Cybercrime and U.S. criminal law provide provisions for real-time access to traffic data without capturing content. If an originator wants to disguise their communication, they can use pseudonymizing techniques, increasing the expectation of privacy. However, many pseudonymizing techniques can still be associated with a particular individual under certain circumstances.

### Expectation of Privacy for Malicious Activity

Individuals involved in malicious activity may forfeit their expectation of privacy, as per the USA PATRIOT Act, which states that a computer trespasser has no reasonable expectation of privacy in any communication transmitted to, through, or from a protected computer. However, IDS are not sufficiently discriminating to distinguish between malicious and benign activities.

If the analysis is correct, the header portions of Internet communications would probably not be considered private. This distinction is important for interpreting legislation and configuring IDS to conform to the law. 

### Criminal Law and IDS

Criminal law generally prohibits the interception of private communications. For example, the Criminal Code of Canada states that willfully intercepting a private communication using any device is an indictable offense. An IDS, which captures and analyzes all network traffic, must operate within these legal constraints. Even if the IP datagrams are eventually discarded, the IDS copies all network traffic, raising legal and ethical considerations.

In summary, the use of IDS and the interception of network traffic must be carefully managed to ensure compliance with legal frameworks and respect for privacy.
