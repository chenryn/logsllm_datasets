Question: "A cryptosystem is designed such that when Bob receives a message from Alice, he verifies the integrity and authenticity using a tag that Alice generates. An adversary, Mallory, has managed to intercept and modify the message, but Bob's verification process fails to detect the tampering. What could be the reason for the failure of Bob's verification process?"
 "A": "Mallory possesses the same key Alice uses and successfully generates a valid tag for the tampered message."
 "B": "The cryptosystem lacks deniability, which allows Mallory to convincingly argue that the message originated from Bob."
 "C": "Alice's original tag was generated using a weak encryption algorithm that Mallory could easily reverse-engineer."
 "D": "Bob is using an outdated verification mechanism that does not account for modern tampering techniques employed by Mallory."
Answer: A
