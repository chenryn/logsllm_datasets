# Environment
    Windows build number:
    Platform      Version               VersionString
    Win32NT     10.0.18362.0        Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version: Version: 0.6.2951.0
# Steps to reproduce
Make the Windows Terminal go full-screen on a 4K monitor.
# Expected behavior
Fast and responsive (like it performs in non-full screen mode).
# Actual behavior
Super slow and sluggish behavior. There is at least a 2s delay for typing and
using `ls` for example will result in a slow animation for listing the content
in a directory. The Terminal is pretty much unusable if I go full-screen
I have a laptop with a 1080p display and I also have an external monitor
connected via mini-display port. Monitor is 4K native 60 Hz, and it works
without any issues. My laptop has also a dedicated GPU (nVidia GTX850m with
the latest drivers). All other apps (i.e. Spotify, Microsoft Edge, Word etc)
perform just fine when in full-screen on this 4K display. However, the Windows
Terminal performs super slow when I go full screen on the monitor.  
Terminal performs fine when I put it in full-screen on the laptop's main
display.
