Hello, folks.
Version 3.0.3 of bootstrap.css has ineffective rules for striped tables which
have rows with .danger or other contextual class(es), if _tbody_ is used
Given a table with the following structure...
                Row 1
                Row 2
                Row 3
...only Row 2 gets emphasized with the _.danger_ contextual class rules. On
hovering these rows, the normal emphasis returns, including the darker color
on the shaded rows.
In dist, the rule for _table-striped_ in bootstrap.css : 1712 overrides the
rule in bootstrap : 1770, because the former contains a _tbody_ selector node,
which determines the rule to be sharper than the latter, where this node is
missing.
This bug has probably been introduced with the super-specific rules for
.table-striped class in `224296f`/less/tables.less, purposed to fix #7281.
