User: As I have started to use Python 3.4, I need pip to maintain libraries on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
How to select the appropriate pip quickly using terminal?
Note:
This question is NOT related to Virtualenv but with the default python2.7 and python3.4 that comes with Fedora 22 Workstation. 
As a temporary fix, I am using PyCharm to manage libraries.
Assistant: I never use pip install directly (when outside a venv, at least).
Instead I use python-<version> -m pip install --user <packages>, which always does what I really meant regardless of what version the wrapper scripts are for. This is especially useful if I've locally installed a newer version of pip.
