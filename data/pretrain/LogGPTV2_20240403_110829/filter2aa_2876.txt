Copyright - Why is this a good 
idea? 
We want to reward authors for being creative. 
Not all authors are motivated purely by a desire 
to create art. 
Copyright - Fair Use 
Fair use factors: 
1) Purpose and Character of the use  
(commercial vs. educational non-profit) 
2) Nature of the copyrighted work 
3) Amount of work copied in relation to entire 
work 
4) Effect of use on potential market or value of 
copyrighted work 
Copyright - Example 1

It becomes a bestseller almost overnight.  
Bob decides to copy and sell the content of the 
novel under the title "Source Simian".  
Can Alan win a copyright suit against Bob? 
Copyright - Example 2 
Gene is an artist, hired to plan and create a 
unique garden for the City.  Gene creates 
precisely designed beds of flowers and 
bushes in ways that have never been seen 
before.  After six months, the plants have 
grown and the City wants to trim them down.  
Gene sues, saying he owns the copyright to 
his work of art, and the City cannot alter it 
without his permission. 
What result and why? 
DMCA 
Digital Millenium Copyright Act 
Passed in 1998 in order to "modernize" some 
aspects of copyright law. 
DMCA - The Good Part 
ISPs and Intermediaries are not responsible for 
infringement by users of their systems. 
To receive protection, Intermediaries block 
infringing content when they are notified of it. 
DMCA - The Bad Part 
Circumvention of technological copy-protection 
methods is illegal. 
Circumvention for Fair Use purposes may be 
legal, but only if you have a right to access 
the material to begin with.   
A separate crime is created for trafficking in 
anti-circumvention software. 
(penalty: $500,000 or 5 years in prison)  
DMCA - Research Exception 
There is an exception under the DMCA for 
legitimate research into copyright controls... 
... but only for research into the cryptographic 
elements of the controls 
DMCA Example 1 
E-Book company publishes a novel.  They 
utilize rot13 encryption to "encrypt" the 
content.  Researcher Rhonda discovers this, 
and publishes an analysis of the encryption 
method, describing how she broke it and was 
able to read the novel. 
E-Book company sues Rhonda for violating 
DMCA.  What happens? 
DMCA Example 2 
E-Book company publishes a novel.  They utilize a 
special method of protection which will only display 
the novel on the E-Book company's reader.  Hacker 
Dave finds this annoying, figures this out, and 
creates a work around so that he can display his 
purchased copy on any of his devices.  He also 
publishes this discovery so that anyone anywhere 
can also do this.  
E-Book company sues Dave for violating DMCA.  
What happens?

Patent - Recent changes
Previously, US had a "first-to-invent" system, 
and this year has switched to a "first-to-file" 
system.  
Patent - Example 1a 
Ivan notices that right before an earthquake, his 
dog starts barking and behaving in a strange 
way.  Ivan files a patent for dogs as 
earthquake detectors. 
Success?  
Patent - Example 1b 
Ivan goes on to create a device which analyzes 
the behavior of nearby dogs and the noises 
they make, and then warns humans in the 
area that an earthquake is coming and they 
should take shelter.  Ivan files for a patent.  
Success?  
Patent - Example 1c 
Paul takes Ivan's device and figures out how it 
works.  Paul adds a volume control knob to 
the device because some people have 
complained that the warning it gives is too 
loud.  Paul tries to patent his invention.   
Success?  
Comparisons: Copyright vs. Trademark 
If you remember our earlier example...  
Alan writes a novel and titles it "Code 
Monkey". 
It becomes a bestseller almost overnight.  
Carl writes and sells his own original novel but 
also uses the title "Code Monkey".   
Alan sues under both Copyright and 
Trademark. 
Does Alan win under either theory?
