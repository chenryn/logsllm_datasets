We build three contraptions that allow us to forge fake ECG
signals. Since all approaches inject the resulting signal at the
sensing electrodes of the Nymi Band, we design a contrivance
that allows us to interface those electrodes in a convenient way.
As described in the previous section, the Nymi Band has a
locking mechanism, which deauthenticates the wearer of the
band immediately if the band is taken off. When the band is
closed, one of the two sensing electrodes is located on the
inside of the band and faces the wearer’s wrist whereas the
other electrode is accommodated at the outside of the band,
available to be touched with a ﬁnger of the other hand. This
way, the electrical circuit is closed and the ECG measurement
can start. If the wearer of the band is recognized, the band goes
to and remains in “authenticated” state as long as the band is
worn.
For ease of use and to allow many successive injection
attempts without opening and closing the Nymi Band, we
modiﬁed a genuine charging cable that is included in the
delivery of the band. As can be seen in Figure 3, the part of the
4

as the modiﬁed charging lead is attached to the band.
charging lead that interfaces with the band has two shorted-out
pins to let the band think it is closed and conveniently exposes
one of the sensing electrodes in a separate wire.
1) Hardware Waveform Generator: Our ﬁrst and the most
obvious approach to artiﬁcially create an ECG trace is to use
an arbitrary waveform generator. The purpose of waveform
generators is to generate electrical waveforms for testing and
analyzing electronic devices. The generated signal is injected
into the device under test while the device’s (electrical) behavior
is observed and analyzed. The waveform itself is deﬁned as
a time series of voltage levels, based on which the waveform
generator produces the corresponding signal. The resulting
signal exactly matches the predeﬁned voltage levels at the given
points on the time axis and interpolates values in between.
We use a Rigol DG4062 Arbitrary Waveform Generator that
is capable of generating signals of up to 60MHz at a sampling
rate of 500 Mega-Samples per second. These speciﬁcations
enable us to transform stored ECG signals to their physical
counterpart with high accuracy. Electrocardiographs commonly
operate at a sampling rate of less than 500 samples per second
when acquiring an ECG trace. This means that higher frequency
components, i.e., more than 250Hz, can not be registered and
hence are not part of the measured signal. Such a frequency
limited signal can easily be synthesized by most of today’s
off-the-shelf hardware waveform generators.
Our signal generator’s two output leads are directly con-
nected to the electrodes of the Nymi Band. In order to optimally
match electrical impedances between signal generator and the
electrodes of the band, we inject the signal through a 75Ω
coaxial cable (see Figure 4). Electrocardiographs most often
feature an instrumentation ampliﬁer with high input impedance
as the ﬁrst step in the signal acquisition pipeline. The Nymi
Band does not differ in that regard and requires a relatively
low impedance input.
We wrote a software library that loads stored ECG signals
directly into the memory of the Rigol DG4062 Arbitrary Wave-
form Generator, sets the necessary parameters and starts/stops
the signal generation. The program code is available upon
request.

Band via the modiﬁed charging lead. The negative output of
the waveform generator is clamped to the electrode facing the
wrist and the positive output is attached to the second electrode
of the band using the modiﬁed charging lead.
2) Software Waveform Generator: Nowadays, almost every
personal electronic device, be it mobile or stationary, possesses
a dedicated sound card or integrated sound functionality to
facilitate analog audio output. Audio signals are an electrical
representation of sound, i.e., a mechanical wave that propagates
through a medium. Thus, sound cards need to be able to
output relatively high-frequency signals. This capability can
be harnessed and lets a sound card be utilized as a low-
frequency waveform generator. In most cases, no hardware
modiﬁcations are needed and arbitrary electrical signals can
be readily generated, provided that the sound card is driven
with the right software components. Naturally, a sound card
based waveform generator is not as capable as a dedicated
hardware solution and has many limitations such as a narrow
range for the generated voltage. However, the nature of ECG
signals, which are inherently low-frequency and on the order
of a few hundred microvolts, can be generated by a sound
card without any problems The majority of dedicated sound
cards as well as devices with integrated sound support have
output frequencies of up to 20kHz, which is well than enough. A
software waveform generator based on a sound card is therefore
a viable option for signal injection. It not only drastically
reduces cost, but also simpliﬁes the injection method. Figure 5
depicts a possible setup where a software waveform generator
is run on a laptop that injects the generated signal though its
audio output port.
3) Audio Playback: Instead of using a software waveform
generator and changing the function of the sound card, we
explore the possibility of playing back stored ECG signals
on the sound card as actual sound. Such an approach does
not require specialized software, i.e., a software waveform
generator, and might be executed on any device capable of
outputting analog audio signals. This could reduce effort and
complexity of a presentation attack to a great extent.
Fig. 5: A laptop is connected to the Nymi Band via the modiﬁed
charging lead. Setup is analogous to the conﬁguration involving
the hardware waveform generator, apart from the coaxial cable
being plugged into the audio output port of a laptop. The laptop
either runs a software waveform generator or is used to play
back an ECG signal that is encoded in an audio ﬁle. The laptop
might be replaced through any electronic device with audio
playback capability.
Fig. 6: Reference ECG signal compared to the ECG traces
measured when the reference signal is injected using three
different injection methods. The traces are captured by the
Nymi Band and read out with the Nymi software development
kit.
The resulting ﬁle can then be played back on almost any device
and potentially injected into the sensors of a biometric system
based on ECG recognition.
The contraption we used for the evaluation of the audio playback
as injection method is identical to the hardware setup in Figure 5.
Nevertheless, the attack can be carried out with any device
capable of analog audio output.
C. Injection Quality
The challenge of replicating an ECG signal directly as audio
output consists of transforming the digital representation of
an ECG signal into an audio ﬁle that can be played back on
the sound card. We wrote software that ﬁlters the ECG signal,
applies the correct scaling of voltage levels, sets the sampling
rate and ﬁnally stores the signal as an audio ﬁle (WAV format).
In order to validate the presented signal injection methods
and assess their quality, we select a stored reference signal,
reproduce and inject it using each of the three approaches.
We then compare the reference signal
to the traces the
electrocardiograph measures while injection takes place. In
case of the Nymi Band, the captured traces can be accessed

TABLE I: Comparison of injection methods
and read out with the Nymi software development kit (SDK).
In addition to a visual comparison between the stored
signal and the extracted ECG traces, we verify their similarity
numerically. The distance metric for comparison is the (per
sample) mean squared error (MSE). We make sure the reference
signal’s sampling rate matches that of the Nymi Band. Also,
the measured traces might be linearly translated and require
alignment before the calculation of the distance metric. We
determine the constant shift between the stored reference signal
and captured traces by aligning the peaks of the R waves.
Results are show in Figure 6. All three proposed injection
methods manage to reproduce the reference signal remarkably
well and we conclude that the contraptions are effective. It is
evident that signal quality is proportional to sophistication and
cost of the contraption used for signal injection: The hardware
waveform generator and audio playback achieve the smallest
error (mean squared error of 0.015 and 0.017, respectively),
outperforming the software signal generator with an MSE of
0.035.
D. Comparison of Injection Methods
In Table I, we present a comparison between our three
injection methods along the criteria outlined above (see Sec-
tion III-A). Not surprisingly, the hardware waveform generator
achieves the highest signal quality, but at the same time entails
the highest cost. Entry-level arbitrary waveform generators
retail at around $250. They are, however, fairly bulky and only
designed for stationary use.
Software waveform generators are not only available for
personal computers, but even smart phones. A low-end smart
phone equipped with an analog audio output costs around $50
as of spring 2016. An ECG signal encoded as an audio ﬁle can
even be played back on a cheap portable audio player which
can cost less than $10 and has a tiny form factor.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In this Section we will outline a number of approaches that
can be used by an attacker to obtain data for a presentation
attack. Based on these attack vectors, we will then discuss our
data collection methodology.
A. Obtaining Data for a Presentation Attack
In Section III we have demonstrated our capability to inject
arbitrary signals into the Nymi Band. However, the attacker
still requires an input ECG signal that is sufﬁciently close to
Fig. 7: The ECG monitor data is extracted through image
analysis of this plot shown by the software. This models the
threat of an attacker obtaining a photo of the victim’s ECG.
that of the victim. There are multiple conceivable approaches
to obtain this data:
Medical records often contain printouts of a patient’s ECG.
A conventional hospital ECG uses 10 adhesive electrodes to
simultaneously record 12 leads (see Section II for details).
An attacker could obtain these records either electronically
(e.g., through social engineering or a compromised medical
database) or on paper (e.g., by taking a photo of the plots). In
addition, mobile devices that allow patients to monitor their
health at home are becoming more widespread. Besides ECG
monitors for medical use, a number of devices are marketed
for ﬁtness, for example in the form of heart rate monitors
used during cardiovascular exercise. In these cases, the data
could be intercepted during transmission (e.g., to the victim’s
smartphone) or leaked through an insecure or malicious mobile
app.
The Nymi SDK allows NEAs to collect arbitrary amounts
of raw ECG data (see Section II). There are two conceivable
ways in which this might pose a security risk: NEAs have to
be actively paired with the NCA by the owner of the band.
However, this only means they are trusted by the user, not that
they are inherently trustworthy. A rogue NEA could trick the
user into providing (a sample of) his ECG, which would then
allow the owner or developer of the NEA to later use this data
to carry out a presentation attack. A second, probably more
severe, way of abusing the SDK data collection is through a
social engineering attack. Given the novelty of the Nymi Band
an attacker might ask the victim to wear the attacker’s Nymi
Band to test whether it is possible for the victim to unlock
it. Instead of performing regular activation, the attacker could
instead activate the band through the backup password and then
collect the victim’s ECG data through a previously paired NEA
(e.g., on a laptop or the attacker’s smartphone). This attack
is particularly dangerous, as the data is collected directly on
a Nymi Band, rather than a different device that requires the
application of the mapping function (see Section V).

B. Data Collection
The previous subsection has outlined several scenarios that
might allow an attacker to obtain a victim’s ECG data. We
collect data using a variety of devices to reﬂect them:
The ﬁrst device we use is a lightweight medical ECG
monitor, the Heal Force Prince 180B (see Figure 8). The device
has two main measurement modes which use either the built-in
electrodes on the sides of the device or an external 3-lead ECG
cable with disposable electrodes. The ﬁrst measurement (which
we will refer to as the Palm measurement throughout the paper)
uses the built-in electrodes. Participants were asked to hold
the device as pictured in Figure 8 and to remain still during
the measurement as the ECG recording is highly sensitive to
device movements. When using the built-in electrodes, the
device always records data for a ﬁxed duration of 30 seconds.
Following the palm measurement, we use the 3-lead cable to
record Lead I and Lead II (see Section II for details), which
involves attaching the disposable electrodes to both arms and
the left leg. Unlike hospital ECGs, which capture all 12 leads
simultaneously, this monitor is limited to recording a single
lead. However, by switching the position of the electrodes, all
standard leads can be recorded in sequence. We chose to record
Lead I, which has measurement points similar to the Nymi
Band, and Lead II, which measures the potential difference
between the right arm and left leg. Due to practical reasons
we choose not to collect a full 12-lead ECG. Both leads are
recorded during a medical ECG, as such an attacker could
obtain them by taking a photo of the patient’s medical ﬁles. In
order to reﬂect this, we don’t extract raw data from the device,
but instead obtain it by performing image analysis on the plots
displayed by the software (see Figure 7).
The second device, pictured in Figure 9, is a mobile ECG
monitor that can be attached to a smartphone and transmits
the recorded data via Bluetooth. Following the measurement,
the device provides an instant assessment with regard to
a number of heart disorders. Participants were again asked
to remain still during the 30-second measurement period
to avoid the introduction of additional noise. Following the
measurement, the device creates a pdf report which can be
automatically sent to an arbitrary e-mail address (such as
the patient’s physician). This report contains, aside from the
patient’s personal information, a plot of the recorded ECG data.
The report is sent via e-mail without any encryption or other
security features. Similar to the ECG monitor data, we use
image analysis to extract the raw data from the pdf ﬁle.
Lastly, we collect data using the Nymi Band itself. As
outlined in Section II, the Nymi SDK allows Nymi Enabled
Applications (NEAs) to collect raw ECG data once the Nymi
Band is unlocked and paired with the NEA. As a result of
the band’s hardware design, this requires the cooperation of
the user as they have to touch the top electrode of the band
to enable ECG recording. Following the user enrollment and
activation of the Nymi Band we collect 60 seconds of raw ECG
data using the SDK. We used three (identical) developer kits of
the Nymi Band running the SDK version 1.03. It is important
to note that the capability of the band to report raw ECG data
to NEAs has been discontinued from SDK version 2.0 onwards.
However, it is still possible to collect data by using the legacy
SDK on the developer bands. The ﬁnal consumer version of the
band has been released in September 2016 and also lacks the

capability to record raw ECG data. We can’t make any claims
on the success of our attack on this new version, although,
based on the published changes in the consumer version, we
can not see any structural obstacles to the attack still being
successful.
C. Participant Recruitment and Ethical Considerations
This project has been reviewed by and received clearance
from the Central University Research Ethics Committee of the
University of Oxford, reference number R42894. The main
ethical concern when gathering ECG data is the sensitive nature
of the data itself. This sensitivity stems from the fact that
a variety of heart disorders can be diagnosed using ECG,
including disorders the participant may not have previously been
aware of. The possibility of false positives (i.e., the incorrect
diagnosis of a condition) in conjunction with the fact that none
of the researchers are trained medical professionals led us to the
decision of disabling all diagnostic capabilities of the devices
used and inform all participants accordingly. Since a future
diagnosis based purely on the data is theoretically possible,
we store all datasets anonymized to erase any links between a
potential condition and a single participant. Given the above
concerns, we required participants to be at least 18 years old
as the only criteria for inclusion in the study.
We recruited a total of 41 participants (21 female, 20 male)
through mailing list adverts and social media. Participants were
made aware that the research involves ECG biometrics, but were

V. MAPPING FUNCTION
In this section, we show how to generate attack signals for
the Nymi Band using ECG data from different sources. The
method is based on the derivation of mapping functions, i.e.,
functions that transform signals recorded from one device, the
source, in order to resemble the morphology of the signals
from a target device. In our case, the target device corresponds
to the Nymi Band. In other words, we aim to ﬁnd a function
that, given in input an ECG signal from a source device, is
able to produce the “same” signal as if it was recorded on the
target device.
In this way, the mapping function can mitigate and even
eliminate the statistical differences in biometric features that
arise from using different measurement devices and modes. In
Figure 10, we compare the mean ECG signals recorded for the
same individuals but from different devices, showing that the
signals exhibit device-speciﬁc morphologies, especially as far
