### Title: Botconf 2018 - Trickbot: The Trick is On You!

The landscape of bot malware is constantly evolving, with both new and existing families incorporating advanced techniques to perpetrate cybercrime. Given the sheer volume of these threats, manual analysis and tracking have become increasingly cumbersome, leading to delayed responses to emerging threats. Consequently, automated systems have become essential in malware research, providing critical data for understanding and countering these dynamic operations. This automation helps to bridge the gap between threat detection and mitigation.

Motivated by this, we conducted an in-depth study on the Trickbot family, which has emerged as one of the most prevalent botnet families since its initial discovery in 2016. Trickbot has continuously evolved, adding new modules to enhance its capabilities for propagation and information theft. New campaigns and modules are still being distributed, making it a persistent and evolving threat.

What particularly intrigued us about Trickbot is its sophisticated network behavior and the diverse range of modules it distributes to its victims. Its use of rotating command-and-control (C2) servers and on-demand module delivery makes manual analysis and monitoring extremely challenging. Recognizing this, we developed a tracker system to monitor Trickbot's infrastructure, which relies on a custom network protocol over TLS. This system provided us with a means to gather data directly from Trickbot's servers.

In this presentation, we will delve into Trickbot's behavior and the methodologies we employed to design and build our monitoring system. We will highlight the challenges we faced and the reverse engineering efforts required to understand and utilize Trickbot's network communication protocol. Our goal is to share the insights and statistics generated by our tracker, and how this data can be leveraged to automate the mitigation of this threat.
