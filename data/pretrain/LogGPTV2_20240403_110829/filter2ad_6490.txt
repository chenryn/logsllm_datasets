BGP, the Internet’s interdomain routing protocol, is highly
vulnerable to routing failures that result from unintentional
misconﬁgurations or deliberate attacks. To defend against
these failures, recent years have seen the adoption of the Re-
source Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), which currently
authorizes 4% of the Internet’s routes. The RPKI is a com-
pletely new security infrastructure (requiring new servers,
caches, and the design of new protocols), a fact that has
given rise to some controversy [1]. Thus, an alternative pro-
posal has emerged: Route Origin Veriﬁcation (ROVER) [4,
7], which leverages the existing reverse DNS (rDNS) and
DNSSEC to secure the interdomain routing system.
Both RPKI and ROVER rely on a hierarchy of authori-
ties to provide trusted information about the routing system.
Recently, however, [2] argued that the misconﬁgured, faulty
or compromised RPKI authorities introduce new vulnerabil-
ities in the routing system, which can take IP preﬁxes oﬄine.
Meanwhile, the designers of ROVER claim that it operates
in a “fail-safe” mode, where “[o]ne could completely unplug a
router veriﬁcation application at any time and Internet rout-
ing would continue to work just as it does today”. There has
been debate in Internet community mailing lists [1] about
the pros and cons of both approaches. This poster there-
fore compares the impact of ROVER failures to those of
the RPKI, in a threat model that covers misconﬁgurations,
faults or compromises of their trusted authorities.
1. ROVER AND RPKI PRIMER
The RPKI and ROVER each provide a trusted mapping
from an IP preﬁx1 to the Autonomous System(s) (ASes)
authorized to originate (i.e., claim to be the destination
for) the preﬁxes in BGP. Both therefore protect against pre-
ﬁx and subpreﬁx hijacks, where the hijacking AS originates
routes for a victim IP preﬁx, that it is not authorized to
originate. During the hijack, traﬃc destined for the victim
IP preﬁx ﬂows to the hijacker’s AS instead.
rDNS. The rDNS is used to resolve IP addresses to host-
1IP preﬁx 8.0.0.0/8 has length 8 and covers 8.8.8.0/24.

names. Zones in rDNS correspond to IP preﬁxes. Data in
the reverse zone can be authenticated by standard DNSSEC
signatures. Per Figure 1, the root for IPv4 is in-addr.arpa,
maintained by IANA.2 The root delegates 8.0.0.0/8 to Level3,
which delegates 8.8.8.0/24 to Google and 8.34.114.0/24 to
Metro Net. An rDNS zone is authoritative for its IP preﬁx
and subpreﬁxes, excluding those delegated to a child zone.
ROVER. ROVER introduces two new types of resource
records to the rDNS: an Secure Route Origin (SRO) to au-
thorize an IP preﬁx π in the zone to be originated in BGP
by an AS a, and a Route Lock (RLOC) to opt a zone in or
out of ROVER. The presence of an RLOC in a zone means
that an SRO is needed for every IP preﬁx for which the
zone is authoritative.
In Figure 1, Level3 has an RLOC
and is authoritative for 8.0.0.0/9; thus, if AS 3356 wishes
to originate 8.0.0.0/9 in BGP, a new SRO must be added
to Level3’s rDNS zone in Figure 1. Metro Net’s zone does
not have an RLOC, so the BGP routes for preﬁxes covered
by 8.34.114.0/24 are opted-out of ROVER. SRO and RLOC
records are validated in the usual DNSSEC manner.
ROVER & route validity. We say a BGP route is an IP
preﬁx π and the AS a originating it in BGP. A router issues
a ROVER query for every new route it learns in BGP. The
response is (DNSSEC) validated and stored in a local cache,
with standard DNS caching used to store responses. For ex-
ample, if a router learns a BGP route for preﬁx 8.8.8.0/24
originated by AS 15169, it should query for any SRO corre-
sponding to preﬁx 8.8.8.0/24; if no SRO is returned for the
preﬁx, the router queries for the RLOC for the authoritative
zone (Google). ROVER’s SROs and RLOCs determine the
validity of an advertised BGP route (π, a) as:
• Valid. (π, a) is valid if it has a matching valid SRO.
• Unknown. (π, a) is unknown if both the RLOC for the
zone that is authoritative for π, and the SRO for (π, a)
are absent or if either fails DNSSEC validation.
• Invalid. (π, a) is invalid if (1) there are valid SROs for π
that do not match a, OR (2) there is no valid SRO for π
and there is a valid RLOC for π’s authoritative zone.
In Figure 1, a route for 8.0.0.0/8 originated by AS 3356 is
valid (because of the matching valid SRO), and a route for
8.0.0.0/8 originated by AS 666 is invalid (because of the
mismatched SRO). Any route for 8.34.114.0/24 is unknown
(because Metro Net does not have an RLOC). Any route for
8.0.0.0/9 is invalid (because Level3 has an RLOC).
RPKI. RPKI has a similar hierarchy of authorities. Each
28.0.0.0/8 is directly allocated by IANA. For non-legacy pre-
ﬁxes, RIRs are also a part of reverse zone hierarchy
113still be reachable; if an attacker disrupts the response to
a ROVER query for 8.8.8.0/24, causing it to fail DNSSEC
validation, then routes for 8.8.8.0/24 become unknown. This
is a crucial manifestation of ROVER’s “fail-safe” approach.
Circumventing ROVER/RPKI protection of BGP.
Another concern is an attacker that disrupts communica-
tions with the RPKI (or ROVER) so that it may circumvent
its protections against routing attacks. Suppose a subpreﬁx
hijacker at AS 666 originates 8.0.0.0/9, thus subpreﬁx hi-
jacking 8.0.0.0/8 away from victim AS 3356. Per Figure 1,
the hijacked route is invalid since it lacks a matching SRO
but is opted into to ROVER with an RLOC. If an attacker
can disrupt communications with RPKI/ROVER so that the
hijacked route is marked as unknown instead of invalid, then
routers will select the hijacked route, and fall victim to the
hijack. (This follows because there is no valid BGP route for
8.0.0.0/9 that is preferred over the unknown hijacked route).
Suppose a router issues a ROVER query for the subpreﬁx
8.0.0.0/9 that was hijacked in BGP; while there is no valid
matching SRO in Figure 1, the on-path attacker will just
inject a bogus, invalidly-signed SRO of its own for 8.0.0.0/9
and any AS. This SRO will fail DNSSEC validation, and
the hijacked route therefore becomes unknown. Because
ROVER issues a separate query for each route learned in
BGP, this highly-targeted attack will aﬀect only the hijacked
preﬁx. Worse yet, advanced DNSSEC attacks [3, 6] mean
that there is a risk that oﬀ-path attackers could launch such
attacks; we will investigate these in future work.
Meanwhile, [2] argues that attacks of this form are less
targeted with the RPKI. To transition a route (π, a) from
invalid to unknown, an on-path RPKI attacker needs to dis-
rupt the delivery of all the ROAs that cover preﬁx π. How-
ever, this would cause all routes authorized by these ROAs
to go from valid to unknown, making the attack easier to
detect. Moreover, disrupting delivery of RPKI objects (or
manifests) would also raise alarms at routers.
3. SUMMARY & OPEN QUESTIONS
We defer our analysis of misconﬁgurations and takedowns
to the full version. Our analysis indicates that ROVER
has several nice “fail-safe” characteristics, that are absent
from the RPKI, to (1) protect BGP from ROVER miscon-
ﬁgurations and (2) prevent attackers that disrupt ROVER
queries from blackholing BGP routes. However, these char-
acteristics can be exploited by (3) attackers that disrupt
ROVER queries in order to circumvent protection of BGP
from (sub)preﬁx hijacks, and (4) authorities that take down
routes authorized by their ROVER descendants. ROVER’s
use of point queries also makes targeted attacks easier, as
compared to the RPKI. Our future work experimentally val-
idates these threats to ROVER, and quantiﬁes their impact
on ROVER’s ability to prevent routing attacks.

authority has a Resource Certiﬁcate (RC), signed by its par-
ent, containing its allocated IP address space and crypto-
graphic public key. An RC can sign (a) other RCs to sub-
allocate address space, or (b) Route Origin Authorizations
(ROAs) (the equivalent of SROs in ROVER) to authorize
an IP preﬁx π covered by the RC to be originated by an AS
a. The RPKI has no equivalent to an RLOC.
RPKI route validity.
In contrast to ROVER, where
a new ROVER query is made each time a router learns a
new route in BGP, an ISP that uses the RPKI downloads
all objects in the public RPKI repositories to its local cache
once per day. Objects are cryptographically veriﬁed, and
the ISP pushes a list of valid ROAs to its routers. This list
determines the validity states for a BGP route (π, a), in a
manner that is slightly diﬀerent from that of ROVER:
• Valid. (π, a) is valid if it has a matching valid ROA.
• Unknown. (π, a) is unknown if there is no valid covering
ROA; a covering ROA is any ROA for a preﬁx covering π.
• Invalid. (π, a) is invalid if it is not unknown or valid.
Routing policies. A BGP router uses its own local poli-
cies to decide whether to discard, or assign lower preference
to, invalid or unknown BGP routes. As discussed in [2], a
router that discards invalid /unknown routes has the best
possible protection against attacks on BGP, but can lose
connectivity to routes that become invalid /unknown as a
result of threats to the RPKI/ROVER. Here we assume the
most plausible set of policies [2]: that a router discards in-
valid routes, and prefers valid routes over unknown routes.
These local policies imply that a route will go oﬄine if a
threat to the RPKI/ROVER causes it to become invalid,
but a route that becomes unknown will still be reachable.
2. ATTACKING PATHS TO ROVER/RPKI
We consider an attacker that disrupts the communication
path to an RPKI/ROVER server but cannot forge signa-
tures of RPKI/ROVER authorities.
Blackholing BGP routes. The assumed routing policies
imply that a BGP route can be blackholed if the attacker can
change its validity state from valid to invalid. [2] argues that
an on-path RPKI attacker can do just that, by disrupting
the delivery of ROAs from an RPKI repository during an
ISP’s daily update of its local cache. If an on-path attacker
corrupts a single bit in the ROA for 8.8.8.0/24 during a bulk
download of ROAs from the RPKI, then the corresponding
route for 8.8.8.0/24 becomes invalid if there is a covering
ROA authorizing AS 3356 to originate 8.0.0.0/8. Thus, the
8.8.8.0/24 route would no longer be reachable. (On the other
hand, the RPKI uses manifests to indicate which objects it
stores. Disrupting delivery of objects or manifests raises
alarms at routers, making this attack more transparent; see
discussion in [5].) With ROVER, however, the route would
