### Issue Description

Over the past two days, I have been thoroughly reviewing my code to determine whether the issue I'm encountering is due to my implementation or a problem with React. I am now fairly convinced that the issue lies with React.

### Code Structure

- **Class Component**: A simple class component that extends `React.Component`.
- **State**: No state is defined in this component.
- **Local Variable**: A local variable, an empty but strongly typed array, is defined within the class.

### Problem Observed

1. **Initial Load**:
   - On the first load, the array is empty as expected.
   - The class has a method to parse a strongly typed parameter.

2. **Method Call**:
   - When the method is called, Chrome DevTools shows that the array already contains two variables, even though no `.push` operation has been performed yet.
   - This is unexpected and confusing, as only one variable should be created by the calling method.

### Debugging Observations

- **Box #1 (Image 1)**:
  - Shows two items in the array, each with different key values.
  - The second item is correct, as shown in the red box #1 in the image.

- **Box #2 (Image 1)**:
  - Confirms that the method is called with a single parameter.
  - The console log in Box #3 confirms that the object is created with the same key as the second item in Box #2.

- **Box #4 (Image 1)**:
  - A quick index test on the array returns `-1`, indicating that the object is not found in the array.
  - This suggests that the objects shown in Box #1 are not actually present in the array.

- **Box #5 (Image 1)**:
  - Another console log of the array shows two items, even before the `.push` method is called.

- **Box #6 (Image 2)**:
  - After the `.push` call, the array shows what appears to be a duplicated object with `[Gi, Gi]`.

- **Box #7 (Image 2)**:
  - Confirms that the object added to the array is indeed the one intended, but it is duplicated.

### Further Testing

- **Commenting Out `.push`**:
  - If the `.push` call is commented out and the code is run again, there are no magical objects, and no objects are added to the array.
  - This behavior is as expected.

### Conclusion

There seems to be a significant issue with the way the array is being populated and displayed in the Chrome DevTools. The objects appear to be added to the array without any explicit `.push` operation, and then they are duplicated when the `.push` method is called.
