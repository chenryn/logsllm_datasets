I have reviewed my code for a solid 2 days to understand if this is me, or
React. I am pretty convinced this is down to React.
I have a simple Class that extends Component
It has no state defined
It has a simple local variable defined - an empty but strongly typed Array
On first load, the Array is empty. I have a method on the class to parse a
strongly typed parameter.
When the method is called, I can see in Chrome dev tools that the Array
magically already has not one, but two variables stored in the Array.

Yes, you read that correctly - the dev tools show **two** strongly typed
variable already added to the Array - even though no .push has occured at this
point.
How is that possible?
Also consider that the method calling this class, has only created a single
variable - yet as the boxes #2 show, two items are indeed created with
different key values ( see above, the second item is correct - shown as red
box #1 on the image below - you can see again, two items in the array tagged
Gi)
As shown in box#3 - that console.log is showing the single parameter, and
confirms that the object is created with the same key as shown in object two,
in box#2
From here it just gets stranger
Box#4 is a quick index test on the Array, checking if the object has been
magically added - the response is -1
This confirms some form of voodoo has occurred to show the object in Box#1 is
a complete lie
So Box#5 is showing the console.log of the Array - again showing the two
items, but again, this is before the .push method has been called
Box#6 is after the .psuh call, which now shows what looks to be a duplicated
object with [Gi, Gi] in the array
Box#7 shows that this is one magical object and the actual object having been
added to the Array

**Now - what happens if we comment out the .push call and run again?**
As expected, there is no magical object and no object added to the array.

Some serious issues going on here.
Please help keep my sanity and point out my stupidity somewhere.
