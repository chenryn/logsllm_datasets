### 4. Phishing Kit Acquisition and Analysis

#### 4.1 Phishing Kit Acquisition

We employ two primary methods to acquire phishing kits targeting Dutch banking clients:

1. **Public Telegram Channels:**
   - We use a "snowball sampling" approach to collect phishing kits from public Telegram channels.
   - Telegram is a popular instant messaging platform that offers end-to-end encryption, making it a preferred choice for criminal activities.
   - Criminals often advertise and sell illegal goods, including phishing kits, on these channels. An example of such an advertisement is shown in Figure 4, where a vendor offers a fake ING payment request page with templates for multiple Dutch banks (a multipanel).

2. **Open Directories on Phishing Domains:**
   - We crawl suspected phishing domains to capture phishing kits.
   - When a domain returns an open directory, we follow the methodology outlined by Cova et al. [9] to search for and download .zip files containing phishing kits.
   - This process is automated, and we do not rely on guessing the names of popular phishing kit .zip files.

#### 4.2 Fingerprinting Kits

To identify and track phishing kits, we manually examine each kit and create unique fingerprints based on their properties. These fingerprints are derived from:

- **File Names and Paths:** Including the full path from the root of the website.
- **Strings on the Main Page:** Uncommon strings in the HTML source code, which can be visible or hidden, such as JavaScript code.

These fingerprints are then used by our crawler to detect phishing kits deployed on various domains. An example of a phishing kit and its corresponding fingerprint is provided in Figure 5.

#### 3. Domain Detector

To discover new phishing domains, we leverage the fact that 78% of all phishing attacks in 2020 were served over HTTPS, requiring X.509 certificates. We monitor the Certificate Transparency Logs Project [19], which collects all issued X.509 certificates, to find potential phishing domains.

**Features Used to Detect Potential Phishing Websites:**

| Domain Feature | Example & References | Score |
|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Punycode Usage | xn-pypl-loac.com [11, 30] | 30 |
| Suspicious TLDs | .xyz, .icu, .top [16, 41] | 20 |
| TLD as Subdomain | x.com.domain.net [16, 27] | 20 |
| Brand Name | brand.domain.net [16, 27] | 40-150 |
| Typosquatted Brand | paypa1.com [22, 27] | 0-110 |
| Suspicious Keyword | login, verify [27, 31] | 25-50 |
| Hyphens Count | brand-n--ame.net [18, 27] | 3x |
| Subdomain Count | sub.x.domain.net [27, 32] | 3x |
| Free Certificate | Letâ€™s Encrypt [16, 48] | 20 |
| Fake www | wwwbrand.com [22] | 45 |

When a domain's score reaches a threshold of 110, it is marked as potentially malicious and added to the Elasticsearch index along with its features and the complete X.509 certificate. This threshold was determined after testing in June-August 2020 and balances true and false positives.

#### 3.3 Domain Crawler

To identify traces of gathered and fingerprinted phishing kits, we crawl each detected domain. The crawler retrieves new possible phishing domains from the Elasticsearch index every hour and processes them as follows:

1. **Online Check:** Determine if the domain is online.
2. **Browser Simulation:** Launch a Firefox browser controlled by Selenium WebDriver [43] to visit the domain.
3. **Data Collection:** Resolve the IP address, store HTML sources, take a screenshot, and extract and hash the favicon using an average hashing function [23].
4. **Favicon Comparison:** Compare the favicon's hash to known hashes of Dutch banks' favicons. If the Hamming distance exceeds 10%, the domain is omitted from further analysis.
5. **Screenshot Hashing:** Generate a perceptual hash for the screenshot to detect changes since the last visit.
6. **WHOIS Record:** Retrieve the WHOIS record to get the registrar and creation date of the domain.

**Phishing Kit Identification:**

- **Resource Search:** Search through the list of loaded resources for partial file path matches.
- **String-Based Search:** Perform a string-based search on the landing page for matching string fingerprints.
- **Extensive Search:** Use wFuzz [33] to HTTP GET all resources included in the fingerprint.

A domain is classified as a true phishing site when at least 10% of a fingerprint is found. Each domain is monitored hourly for up to seven days after the initial analysis.

#### 3.4 Deployment and Testing

Figure 6 provides an overview of the deployment and testing process. We started by exploring Telegram for publicly available phishing kits, dissected them to create fingerprints, and used these to detect phishing activity on domains. In parallel, we developed and refined our measurement system. During the testing phase, we continuously added newly found phishing kits to the crawler application and identified five new, unknown phishing kits, creating fingerprints for them. Data collection began in September 2020.

#### 4. Phishing Kit Analysis

Our analysis of the 70 collected phishing kits involved manual dissection, understanding their operating procedures, and clustering their features to discern phishing kit families.

**Anatomy of a Phishing Kit:**

- **Front-End Pages:** Impersonate the original login screens of targeted banks or act as decoy landing pages.
- **Resources:** Include JavaScript, CSS, and images, either hosted on the same server or retrieved from the target organization's website.
- **Manuals:** Provide detailed instructions for setting up a VPS, acquiring a TLS certificate, and installing the phishing kit.
- **Control Panel:** Allows the phisher to access the backend, view phished credentials, and trigger new events for the victim.
- **Anti-Detection Methods:** Implement cloaking techniques to prevent detection by law enforcement, researchers, or anti-phishing services.

**Phishing Kit Families:**

Due to the unstructured nature of phishing kit development, precise distinctions between the 70 kits are challenging. Many kits contain copies, older versions, or modifications of one another.
