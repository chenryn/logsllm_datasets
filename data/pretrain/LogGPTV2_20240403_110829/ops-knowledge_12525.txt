User: Please list several virtualization technologies and explain their advantages, disadvantages and application scenarios respectively.
Assistant: 1. Full virtualization technology: Full virtualization technology realizes virtualization by adding a virtualization layer between the physical hardware and the operating system. These virtual machines look just like the operating system and can run any operating system without modification. The advantage of full virtualization technology is that multiple operating systems can run simultaneously on the same computer, which improves resource utilization. The downside is that the virtualization layer slows down performance and requires a lot of extra work when the virtual machine starts. Application scenarios include server virtualization, cloud computing and other scenarios. 2. Paravirtualization technology: Paravirtualization technology improves the efficiency of virtualization by modifying the operating system kernel to interact with the virtualization layer. Compared with full virtualization, paravirtualization technology reduces the workload of the virtualization layer, thereby improving performance. However, a virtual machine using paravirtualization technology requires modification of the operating system, so it is only suitable for a small number of operating systems or applications. Application scenarios include data centers, cloud computing and other scenarios. 3. Container virtualization technology: Container virtualization technology is a lightweight virtualization technology. While sharing the operating system kernel on the host machine, each container runs in an independent user space, realizing isolation. Compared with full virtualization and paravirtualization, container virtualization brings less overhead and faster startup speed. The disadvantage of container virtualization is that it limits the choice of operating systems and applications, requiring careful consideration in terms of operating system versions and application dependencies. Application scenarios include Web application containerization, DevOps and other scenarios.
