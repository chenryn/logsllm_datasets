### Issue Report

**VSCode Version:** 1.0.0  
**OS Version:** Ubuntu 16.04

#### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Down` - the default Ubuntu hotkey to move a window to another desktop.

#### Current Situation:
- I have currently set the hotkey to `Ctrl+Shift+D` for my personal use.
- However, it would be beneficial if VSCode could natively support OS-specific hotkeys out of the box, without requiring manual configuration.

#### Suggested Improvement:
- Integrate OS-specific hotkeys (such as `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Down` for Ubuntu) into VSCode by default, to enhance user experience and reduce the need for custom configurations.
