or does it still constitute an intercept if only the packet header is captured?  Does the
intercept take place when the link-level frame is copied into memory, or does it only
take  place  when  the  packet  is  logged  because  it  has  been  deemed  to  be  malicious?
These questions will probably only be answerable in a court of law.  In the author’s
view, however, given that IDS make a copy of all network traffic, regardless of what
they actually log, the use of IDS will almost certainly be considered to fall within the
definition of device, and to be considered an intercept within the meaning of criminal
law.  
5.1   Exemptions in Criminal Law
The above analysis led to the conclusion that the use of IDS would likely, by strict
definition,  constitute  an  offence  against  relevant  provisions  in  criminal  law.    There
are,  however,  exemptions  in  the  criminal  law  that  specify  conditions  under  which
intercept would not be an offence.  In general, the exemptions are where consent to
the interception, express or implied, has  been given by  the originator  of  the  private
communication or the intended recipient; where an authorization has been obtained;
and where the interception is by a person engaged in providing a telephone, telegraph
or other communication service to the public.
Consent
Consent  provisions  imply  that  one  party  consent  to  the  interception  (i.e.  either  the
originator or the intended recipient) is sufficient to exempt the individual performing
the  interception  from  the  effects  of  criminal  law.  Obtaining  the  consent  of  the
recipient (e.g. the employee) may be straightforward  by  making  consent  part of  the
conditions  of  being  granted  a  network  account,  or  use  banners  indicating  that  the
information  system  being  used  is  subject  to  being  monitored  for  security  purposes,
and that continued use of the system constitutes consent to such monitoring.27 What
happens  if  an  individual  sends  a  communication  to  the  wrong  address?    Does  the
(unintended) recipient have a right to consent to its interception?  The answer to this
question is not at all clear.
Obtaining  the  consent  of  originators  (i.e.  persons  outside  the  organization  where
the monitoring is taking place) may be more problematic.  Two key concepts related
to consent are knowledge and choice.  Does the individual know that the intercept is
taking place?  Ensuring that the originator knows the interception is taking place may
be problematic.  Does the individual have a realistic choice – is there an alternative
communications  path  that  is  not  subject  to  monitoring  (intercept)?    In  terms  of
network  communications,  the  answer  to  the  latter  question  is  probably  no  –  most
organizations  will  try  to  ensure  that all  points  of  interconnection  to  the  Internet  are
adequately protected against intrusions (including the use of IDS).
27 However, mere employee consent to surveillance is no longer sufficient to justify unlimited
surveillance activities.  Surveillance is to be limited to that which a reasonable person would
consider appropriate.  See: Geist, M., “Shift to more workplace privacy protection”, dated 28
June 2002, Globe and Mail newspaper (online).
148         S.R. Johnston
There  is  also  the  issue  of  implied  consent.    For  an  individual  external  to  the
organization, does the continued use of the computer system really constitute consent
to monitoring for security purposes?  Does the posting of a legal or privacy policy to a
website  create  a  diminished  expectation  of  privacy?  Should  consent  to  intercept  be
implied by the simple act of sending an e-mail? In the absence of definitive proof that
the  individual  initiating  the  communication  knew  that  the  communication  would  be
subject to intercept, it is likely that the courts would tend to be conservative and deem
that the originator has a reasonable expectation that the communication would not be
intercepted.28
The Supreme Court of Canada has held that one party consent to the monitoring of
private  communications,  even  though  it  does  not  contravene  the  provisions  of  the
Criminal Code, violates the protection provided by Section 8 of the Charter, dealing
with  search  and  seizure.29    This  implies  that  organizations  could  not  rely  on  this
provision to provide adequate legal authority to conduct intrusion detection.
Authorization
In  order  for  an  authorization  for  the  interception  of  private  communications  to  be
granted  under  criminal  law,  there  must  be  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  an
offence against criminal law has been or will be committed; either the originator of
the private communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it has
consented  to  the  interception;  and  there  must  be  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that
information concerning the offence will be obtained through the interception sought.
30    Authorizations  are  required  for  each  instance  of  interception,  and  requests  for
authorization must specify the particulars of the offence.  When the authorization is
granted,  it  will  specify  the  identities  of  the  persons,  if  known,  whose  private
communications are to be intercepted, and the period for  which  the  authorization  is
required.31 Most authorizations can only be granted for a maximum of 60 days before
they need to be renewed.
Criminal  law  provisions  for  interception  of  private  communications  are  not
generally  suited  to  interception  of  private  communications  for  network  protection.
Given the unpredictable nature of network intrusions, it would be difficult to provide
particulars of the offence that will be committed.  In most cases it will be impossible
to  accurately  identify  the  responsible  individuals,  and  for  intrusion  detection
purposes, the authorization would need to be permanent.
28 Rubinkam, M., “Court to Decide on Web Wiretapping”, Los Angeles Times article, dated 19
February 2002.  In this article, the author refers to a case heard by the Pennsylvania Superior
Court.  The court ruled that the accused “had consented to the recording by the very act of
sending  e-mail  and  instant  messages”.    The  court  further  stated  that  “any  reasonably
intelligent person, savvy enough to be using the Internet… would be aware that messages are
received  in  a  recorded  format,  by  their  very  nature”.    While  not  authoritative,  a  court  in
Canada may find this case informative/instructive.

Telecommunications Service Providers
Criminal law provides exemptions relating to interception of private communications
by  the  provider  of  a  telephone,  telegraph  or  other  communication  service32  to  the
public.  The terms telephone and telegraph are not explicitly defined in criminal law,
however, the definition of telecommunications is sufficiently broad that telephone and
telegraph communication services would likely cover network services.
Interception must be necessary for the provision of the service, or it must relate to
service  observing  or  random  monitoring  for  the  purposes  of  service  quality  control
checks.  Depending on the service being provided, an argument could easily be made
that  the  use  of  IDS  as  an  integral  component  of  a  layered  security  architecture  is
essential to ensure the quality of the service, especially confidentiality, integrity and
availability.    Other  methods  of  detecting  intrusions,  such  as  detailed  review  of  all
entries in device logs, are potentially more invasive than the use of IDS, which act as
a filter to reduce the volume of information examined by an analyst.
These conditions, which would seem to apply to the use of IDS, apply to a person
who is providing a telephone, telegraph or other communication service to the public.
A key reason for public and private sector organizations moving online is to be able to
improve the service they provide to the public.  However, it is not at all clear if this is
sufficient  for  them  to  be  considered  a  telecommunications  service  provider  for  the
purposes of criminal law.  This is an issue that will require further analysis.
Previous analysis led to the conclusion that the header portions of network traffic
probably  do  not  constitute  private  communications.    However,  the  use  of  IDS  for
network traffic monitoring would probably still constitute an intercept under criminal
law,  as  the  initial  copying  of  network  traffic  includes  content,  even  if  it  is  not
subsequently logged.  An examination of existing criminal law exemptions suggests
their  application  to  public  or  private  sector  organizations  would  be  problematic  at
best.    They  were  intended  for  the  intercept  of  private  communications  for  the
purposes  of  collecting  evidence  of  a  criminal  offence,  not  for  network  protection
purposes.
6   Anti-terrorism Law
Prior to September 11, the interception of private communications was governed by
criminal law as discussed above.  The general conclusion was that the use of IDS may
constitute an interception as defined in criminal law, and that the existing exemptions
did  not  adequately  address  the  interception  of  private  communications  for  network
protection purposes.    In  response  to  the  attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  and  the
Pentagon,  a  number  of  countries  either  initiated  or  accelerated  plans  to  introduce
32  See  e.g.:  (COE)  Convention  on  Cybercrime  (ETS  185),  Section  1A,  article  1(c),  and
Explanatory Report, article 26.  “Service provider” means  any public  or  private  entity  that
provides to users of its service the ability to communicate by means of a computer system.
The  term  "service  provider"  is  deliberately  broad,  and  may  include  a  closed  group  or  the
facilities of a provider that are open to the public, whether free of charge or for a fee. The
closed group can be, for example, the employees of a private enterprise to whom the service
is offered by a corporate network.

government  agencies  authority  to  read  e-mail,  SMS  and voice  messages  without  an

6.1   Interception of Private Communication
Prior  to  the  introduction  of  anti-terrorism  legislation,  the  interception  of  private
communications was conducted in accordance with strict  rules.    Specific  conditions
had to be met before an authorization could be granted, and strict conditions applied
to the actual conduct of the interception.  Interception was also generally limited to
telephone  communications.    This  tended  to  restrict  the  circumstances  in  which
interception could be conducted. For instance, a wiretap order only applied to a single
telephone  number.  There  was  some  judicial  discretion  with  respect  to  granting  or
denying  requests  for  authorization.    This  combination  provided  a  certain  degree  of
assurance that the privacy of network communications would not be violated without
cause.
In the wake of the September 11 attacks, there were calls to grant law enforcement
agencies  much  broader  powers  to  monitor  private  communications  and  access
personal  information.    The  bills  generally  responded  to  these  calls  by  amending
existing  criminal  law  provisions  governing  interception  of  private  communications.
The  nature  of  the  information  that  can  be  captured  has  been  broadened  to  include
dialing,  routing  and  addressing  information,  effectively  enabling  law  enforcement
agencies  to  monitor  and  intercept  electronic  mail,  web  surfing  and  other  forms  of
electronic communications.35 Law enforcement agencies are now permitted to obtain

a single authorization to tap any communications that a suspect may use.   Combined
with  claims  that  the  level  of  judicial  discretion  has  essentially  been  drastically
reduced, this has prompted fears of the potential for massive invasions of privacy36.
Whether these fears are justified or not, the amendments still do not provide a general
authorization for interception of network communications by public and private sector
organizations – they must still operate under the prior, more restrictive regime.
There  appear,  however,  to  be  two  exemptions  to  the  above  statement.    The  first
comes  in  Canada’s  Anti-Terrorism  Act.    This  Act  includes  a  specific  clause
authorizing intercept of private communications for the purposes of protecting  GoC
computers and networks. 37  However, this clause only applies to a single government
agency (CSE) and then only under strict conditions, similar to those in the Criminal
Code.38  An authorization made under this section may contain any conditions that the
Minister considers advisable to protect the privacy of Canadians, including additional
measures to restrict the use and retention of, the access to, and the form and manner
of  disclosure  of,  information  derived  from  the  private  communications.  There  is  at
least  an  indication,  therefore,  that  attempts  will  be  made  to  respect  the  privacy  of
network communications.
It is important to remember, however, that this authorization can only be provided
to CSE, leaving all other GoC departments and agencies without a specific legislative
basis for the conduct of intrusion detection.  Provision does exist  within  the  act  for
persons  who  assist  with  the  execution  of  the  authorization  to  be  covered  by  the
authorization39,  but  the  implications  of  this  for  the  GoC,  from  an  operational
perspective, have yet to be examined.
The second exception is a provision in the USA PATRIOT Act, which amends US
Code to add a provision that “it shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person
acting  under  color  of  law  to  intercept  the  wire  or  electronic  communications  of  a
computer  trespasser  transmitted  to,  through,  or  from  the  protected  computer,  if  the
owner  or  operator  of  the  protected  computer  authorizes  the  interception  of  the
computer  trespasser’s  communications    on  the  protected  computer;  and  such
interception does not acquire communications other than those transmitted to or from
the computer trespasser.’’40
At first glance, this would appear to provide, in the United States at least, owners
of  a  protected  computer41  the  legal  right  to  intercept  private  communications.

However, it may not be as simple as that.  First, the definition of protected computer
appears  to  be  fairly  narrow,  being  a  computer  that  is  exclusively  for  the  use  of  a
financial institution or the United States Government or which is used in interstate or
foreign commerce or communication.  In relation to the private sector, for instance,
what  computers  would  this  cover  –  individual  workstations,  web  or  mail  servers
(which could arguably be for foreign communication)?  The answer to this question is
not at all clear.

logging  of  specific
communications, or to the copying of communications performed by an IDS prior to
scanning, IDS are not sufficiently discriminating to ensure that only communications
from the computer trespasser will be ‘acquired’. There does not appear to be any issue
with  the  IDS  sensor  scanning  network  traffic  looking  for  indications  of  malicious
activity and generating alerts/alarms as a result of the scanning.  The problems appear
to arise when a human analyst must examine any flagged traffic to validate the alarm
(i.e. is it a valid alarm, or a false positive?).  Even if they only log traffic deemed to be
malicious,  the  current  state  IDS  technology  almost  guarantees  that  at  least  some  of
this traffic will be benign (i.e. false positives), thereby violating this condition.  In the
absence  of  judicial  interpretation  of  this  provision,  it  is  unlikely  that  organizations
could generally rely upon it for legal authority to intercept private communications.
6.2   Data Retention
The  second  controversial  provision  in  most  anti-terrorism  law  concerns  data
retention.42    A  distinction  must  be  made  between  data  preservation,  where  data  is
stored and retained in response to a specific request and data retention, where the data
is  stored  as  a  routine  practice.    As  a  general  rule,  there  seems  to  be  very  little
controversy  associated  with  data  preservation.    On  the  other  hand,  data  retention  is
causing a great deal of concern, especially among ISPs.  Prior to the introduction of
the anti-terrorism legislation, traffic data was only retained as long as was necessary
for  billing  purposes,  and  at  the  end  of  that  period  was  either  to  be  anonymized  or
destroyed.  Combined with the increasing trend to billing flat rates for network access,
this ensured that a minimum of private information was collected and stored.
The  anti-terrorism  legislation  not  only  increased  the  duration  for  which  this
information  had  to  be  stored,  it  also  considerably  expanded  the  information  to  be
retained43,  although  it  appears  as  if  it  is  predominantly  traffic  data  that  is  to  be
42 Provisions for data retention are also found elsewhere.  See e.g.: Anonymous, “Proposal for a
Directive  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  concerning  the  processing  of
personal  data  and  the  protection  of  privacy  in  the  electronics  communications  sector”,
document  reference  /*COM/2000/0385  final  –  COD  2000/0189*/  (replacing  Directive
97/66/EC,  adopted  15  December  1997).    This  proposal  was  accepted  in  a  vote  in  the
European Parliament 30 May 2002.

extensive:  user-id  and  password  (remote  login);  sender  and  receiver  (login@domain),
identifying information of e-mail retrieved (e-mail); and hostname or IP address, nickname

retained.    While  this  was  aimed  at  e-mails  and  web  traffic,  there  is  no  reason  to
suppose  that  data  collected  by  IDS  would  not  be  covered  by  these  provisions,  as  it
likely  falls  within  the  definition  of  traffic  data.    While  this  poses  a  number  of  data
storage and management problems, it also poses problems with respect to privacy of
network communications.  As mentioned, IDS are prone to generating false positives.
Unless  procedures  are  in  place  to  examine  all  of  the  flagged  traffic,  and  then  to
