The  reason  for  dividing  a  stroke  into  several 
segments  is  to  compare  number  of  the  trends  and 
evaluate  the  similarity  of  corresponding  segments  of 
the original and reentered graphical passwords. Only if 
the  two  counts  are  equal  and  the  similarity  is  higher 
than a predefined threshold value, is the authentication 
proved to be a legal one.

{2,4,6,8},  more  information  is  needed  as  the 
single  character  in  such  a  set  cannot  make  a  final 
decision on an exact Trend Quadrant. 
Based  on  the  Trend  Quadrant  concept  described 
above,  the  umbrella  example  in  Fig.5  containing  two 
strokes  can  be  divided  into  five  sequenced  trends: 
III→I(IV)→II→III→II  as  illustrated  in  Fig.10.  The 
second  trend  I(IV)  means  that  the  corresponding 
segment  is  in  Trend  Quadrant  I  or  IV,  but  is  still 
uncertain as to which exact Trend Quadrant it belongs 
to.  That  is  to  say,  it  may  have  the  same  trend  with  a 
segment which is up-right or down-right.

3.3.3.  Division  of  a  Stroke.  Usually,  the  graphical 
passwords consist of several strokes. Study shows that 
the  shapes  of  secret  images  are  mostly  influenced  by 
user  personality.  For  example,  different  people  may 
have different styles when drawing a same letter ‘Q’ on 
the grid canvas as illustrated in Fig.11.

3.3.4.  Similarity  Algorithm.  Before  the  similarity 
comparison  of  two  coded  strings  is  carried  out,  two 
steps of authentication must be passed. That is, (1) the 
two  corresponding  images  should  share  the  same 
number  of  strokes,  (2)  and  each  corresponding  stroke 
in  the  two  images  should  have  the  same  Trend 
Quadrants sequence.
