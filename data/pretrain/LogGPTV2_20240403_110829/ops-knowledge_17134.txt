I have been using the `dnspython` module in Python. However, I encountered an issue when trying to use it on a new Linux installation; the module is not being loaded. I have attempted to clean up and reinstall, but the installation does not seem to be working.

Here are the details of my environment and the steps I took:

```sh
$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ sudo pip install dnspython
Downloading/unpacking dnspython
  Downloading dnspython-1.11.1.zip (220Kb): 220Kb downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package dnspython

Installing collected packages: dnspython
  Running setup.py install for dnspython

Successfully installed dnspython
Cleaning up...

$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named dns
```

Additionally, here is the output of the `which python`, `python --version`, and `pip --version` commands:

```sh
$ which python
/usr/bin/python

$ python --version
Python 2.7.3

$ pip --version
pip 1.0 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
```

I also want to note that I have a firewall installed on the new machine. Although I am not certain if it should affect the import, I have tried disabling it, but the issue persists.

For reference, I was able to successfully install `dnspython` version 1.11.1 on my Ubuntu box using `pip install dnspython` and could import the `dns` module without any issues. My Ubuntu-based server is running Python 2.7.4.

Thank you very much for your help.
