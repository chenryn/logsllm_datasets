With the official end-of-life for Python 2.7 on January 1st of this year, it is no longer advisable to use it as a prerequisite in the computing world. Although some macOS users may still rely on it, they should now have Python 3 installed, given that Python 2.7 is no longer supported. Therefore, it would be prudent to upgrade `node-gyp` to version 5.1.0 or higher (refer to [nodejs/node-gyp#2052](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/2052) for more details).
