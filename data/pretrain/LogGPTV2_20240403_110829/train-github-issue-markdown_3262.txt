As Python 2.7 was finally abandoned on January 1st of this year and should no
longer be a prerequisite for anything in the computing world (except maybe
folks on macos, all of whom should have python3 installed anyway now that 2.7
is dead) it would be a good idea to bump the version of `node-gyp` to 5.1.0 or
higher (see nodejs/node-gyp#2052)
