User: I have been doing a little bit of research and haven't found anything that is quite going to work. I want to have python know what the current song playing in iTunes is so I can serially send it to my Arduino.
I have seen Appscript but it is no longer supported and from what I have read full of a few bugs now that it hasn't been updated.
I am using Mac OS X 10.8.2 & iTunes 10.0.1
Anyone got any ideas on how to make this work. Any information is greatly appreciated.
FYI: My project is a little 1.8' colour display screen that I am going to have serval pieces of information on RAM HDD CPU Song etc.
Assistant: You can set up a simple Automator workflow to retrieve the current iTunes song. Try these two actions for starters:

iTunes: Get the Current Song 
Utilities: Run Shell Script

Change the shell script to cat > ~/itunes_track.txt and you should have a text file containing the path of the current track. Once you get your data out of Automator you should be all set :)
