Dnscmd
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
A command-line interface for managing DNS servers. This utility is useful in scripting batch files to help automate routine DNS management tasks, or to perform simple unattended setup and configuration of new DNS servers on your network.
Syntax
dnscmd   []
Parameters
Parameter
Description
The IP address or host name of a remote or local DNS server.
dnscmd /ageallrecords command
Sets the current time on a time stamp on resource records at a specified zone or node on a DNS server.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /ageallrecords [] | [/tree]|[/f]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the DNS server that the administrator plans to manage, represented by IP address, fully qualified domain name (FQDN), or Host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the FQDN of the zone.
Specifies a specific node or subtree in the zone, using the following:@ for root zone or FQDNThe FQDN of a node (the name with a period (.) at the end)A single label for the name relative to the zone root.
/tree
Specifies that all child nodes also receive the time stamp.
/f
Runs the command without asking for confirmation.
Remarks
The ageallrecords command is for backward compatibility between the current version of DNS and previous releases of DNS in which aging and scavenging were not supported. It adds a time stamp with the current time to resource records that do not have a time stamp, and it sets the current time on resource records that do have a time stamp.
Record scavenging does not occur unless the records are time stamped. Name server (NS) resource records, start of authority (SOA) resource records, and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) resource records are not included in the scavenging process, and they are not time stamped even when the ageallrecords command runs.
This command fails unless scavenging is enabled for the DNS server and the zone. For information about how to enable scavenging for the zone, see the aging parameter, within the syntax of the dnscmd /config command in this article.
dnscmd /config
The addition of a time stamp to DNS resource records makes them incompatible with DNS servers that run on operating systems other than Windows Server. A time stamp added by using the ageallrecords command can't be reversed.
If none of the optional parameters are specified, the command returns all resource records at the specified node. If a value is specified for at least one of the optional parameters, dnscmd enumerates only the resource records that correspond to the value or values that are specified in the optional parameter or parameters.
Examples
Example 1: Set the current time on a time stamp to resource records
dnscmd /clearcache command
Clears the DNS cache memory of resource records on the specified DNS server.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /clearcache
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Example
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /clearcache
dnscmd /config command
Changes values in the registry for the DNS server and individual zones. This command also modifies the configuration of the specified server. Accepts server-level and zone-level settings.
Caution
Don't edit the registry directly unless you have no alternative. The registry editor bypasses standard safeguards, allowing settings that can degrade performance, damage your system, or even require you to reinstall Windows. You can safely alter most registry settings by using the programs in Control Panel or Microsoft Management Console (mmc). If you must edit the registry directly, back it up first. Read the registry editor help for more information.

/isslave [0|1]
Determines how the DNS server responds when queries that it forwards receive no response. Accepts the values:0 - Specifies that the DNS server is not a subordinate. If the forwarder does not respond, the DNS server attempts to resolve the query itself. This is the default setting.1 - Specifies that the DNS server is a subordinate. If the forwarder does not respond, the DNS server terminates the search and sends a failure message to the resolver.

/notcp
This parameter is obsolete, and it has no effect in current versions of Windows Server.
/recursionretry []

Instead, it returns the first record to every query.1 - The DNS server rotates among the records that it returns from the top to the bottom of the list of matching records. This is the default setting.
/rpcprotocol [0x0|0x1|0x2|0x4|0xFFFFFFFF]
Specifies the protocol that remote procedure call (RPC) uses when it makes a connection from the DNS server. Accepts the values:0x0 - Disables RPC for DNS.0x01 - Uses TCP/IP0x2 - Uses named pipes.0x4 - Uses local procedure call (LPC).0xFFFFFFFF - All protocols. This is the default setting.
/scavenginginterval []
Determines whether the scavenging feature for the DNS server is enabled, and sets the number of hours (0x0-0xFFFFFFFF) between scavenging cycles. The default setting is 0x0, which disables scavenging for the DNS server. A setting greater than 0x0 enables scavenging for the server and sets the number of hours between scavenging cycles.
/secureresponses [0|1]
Determines whether DNS filters records that are saved in a cache. Accepts the values:0 - Saves all responses to name queries to a cache. This is the default setting.1 - Saves only the records that belong to the same DNS subtree to a cache.
/sendport []
Specifies the port number (0x0-0xFFFFFFFF) that DNS uses to send recursive queries to other DNS servers. The default setting is 0x0, which means that the port number is selected randomly.
/serverlevelplugindll[]
Specifies the path of a custom plug-in. When Dllpath specifies the fully qualified path name of a valid DNS server plug-in, the DNS server calls functions in the plug-in to resolve name queries that are outside the scope of all locally hosted zones. If a queried name is out of the scope of the plug-in, the DNS server performs name resolution using forwarding or recursion, as configured. If Dllpath is not specified, the DNS server ceases to use a custom plug-in if a custom plug-in was previously configured.
/strictfileparsing [0|1]
Determines a DNS server's behavior when it encounters an erroneous record while loading a zone. Accepts the values:0 - The DNS server continues to load the zone even if the server encounters an erroneous record. The error is recorded in the DNS log. This is the default setting.1 - The DNS server stops loading the zone, and it records the error in the DNS log.
/updateoptions 
Prohibits dynamic updates of specified types of records. If you want more than one record type to be prohibited in the log, use hexadecimal addition to add the values, and then enter the sum. Accepts the values:0x0 - Doesn't restrict any record types.0x1 - Excludes start of authority (SOA) resource records.0x2 - Excludes name server (NS) resource records.0x4 - Excludes delegation of name server (NS) resource records.0x8 - Excludes server host records.0x100 - During secure dynamic update, excludes start of authority (SOA) resource records.0x200 - During secure dynamic update, excludes root name server (NS) resource records.0x30F - During standard dynamic update, excludes name server (NS) resource records, start of authority (SOA) resource records, and server host records. During secure dynamic update, excludes root name server (NS) resource records and start of authority (SOA) resource records. Allows delegations and server host updates.0x400 - During secure dynamic update, excludes delegation name server (NS) resource records.0x800 - During secure dynamic update, excludes server host records.0x1000000 - Excludes delegation signer (DS) records.0x80000000 - Disables DNS dynamic update.
/writeauthorityns [0|1]

Accepts the values:0 - Writes name server (NS) resource records in the Authority section of referrals only. This setting complies with Rfc 1034, Domain names concepts and facilities, and with Rfc 2181, Clarifications to the DNS Specification. This is the default setting.1 - Writes name server (NS) resource records in the Authority section of all successful authoritative responses.
