sys.getsizeof() uses the `__sizeof__` method, if defined, to return a Python
object's full memory footprint (including owned data areas that lay outside of
the basic object structure).
Currently:
    >>> x = np.zeros((20000,))
    >>> x.nbytes 
    160000
    >>> sys.getsizeof(x)
    80
On the other hand, since the underlying buffer can be shared by several
objects, it's not obvious how non-misleading the answer would be.
