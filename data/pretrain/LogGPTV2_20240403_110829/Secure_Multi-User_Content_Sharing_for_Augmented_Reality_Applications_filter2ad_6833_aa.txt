## Abstract

Augmented reality (AR), which overlays virtual content on the user's perception of the real world, is now entering the consumer market. In addition to smartphone platforms, early-stage head-mounted displays such as the Microsoft HoloLens are under active development. Many compelling uses of these technologies involve multiple users, including in-person collaborative tools, multiplayer gaming, and telepresence. While prior work on AR security and privacy has focused on potential risks from AR applications, new risks will also arise among multiple human users. In this work, we explore the challenges in designing secure and private content sharing for multi-user AR. We analyze representative application case studies and systematize design goals for security and functionality that a multi-user AR platform should support. We design an AR content sharing control module that achieves these goals and build a prototype implementation (ShareAR) for the HoloLens. This work lays the foundation for secure and private multi-user AR interactions.

## 1. Introduction

Augmented reality (AR) technologies, which overlay digitally generated content on a user’s view of the physical world, are becoming commercially available. AR smartphone applications like Pokémon Go and Snapchat, as well as AR platforms from Apple, Facebook, and Google, are already accessible to billions of consumers. More sophisticated AR headsets, such as those from Magic Leap, Meta, and Microsoft, are available in developer or beta editions. The AR market is growing rapidly, with a projected value of $90 billion by 2022.

The power of AR to shape users’ perceptions of reality and integrate virtual objects with the physical world brings significant security and privacy risks. It is crucial to address these risks early, while AR is still under active development, to achieve robust security and privacy. The computer security and privacy community has taken steps to identify and mitigate potential risks from malicious or buggy AR apps, such as limiting untrusted apps’ access to sensor data or restricting the virtual content they can display. However, a critical gap in prior work is the lack of consideration for undesirable interactions between multiple human users of an AR app or ecosystem.

Many compelling use cases for AR involve multiple users, each with their own AR device, who may be physically co-located or collaborating remotely and interacting with shared virtual objects. For example, in-person collaborative tools, multiplayer gaming, and telepresence. One concrete example is Ubiquity6’s smartphone platform, where all users can view and interact with all AR content within the app.

In these contexts, security, privacy, and safety risks for AR users come not only from the apps on their own devices but also from other users. For instance, one user might spam others with annoying or disturbing virtual objects, or manipulate another person’s virtual object without permission. Such issues have already begun to emerge, with reports of "vandalism" of AR art in Snapchat and studies finding that pairs of AR users often position virtual objects in each other’s personal space.

Existing AR platforms provide limited or no support to app developers for handling these issues. For example, the HoloLens supports running an app shared between multiple device users but provides only basic cross-device messaging features, with no framework for complex multi-user interactions.

**This work: Sharing Control for Multi-User AR.** In this work, we address the challenge of providing secure and private content sharing capabilities for multi-user augmented reality applications. Unlike prior AR security work that focused on protecting users from untrusted apps, we aim to limit undesirable interactions between mutually distrusting human users. By addressing this issue before multi-user AR becomes widespread, we aim to inform the design of future AR systems, thereby preventing such multi-user concerns from manifesting broadly.

## 2. Problem Formulation and Design Goals

We begin by formulating the problem space and goals for secure and private multi-user AR content sharing. To do so systematically, we consider four case study apps that explore unique points in the multi-user AR design space and exercise a broad range of functionality and security needs.

### 2.1 Case Study Applications

#### Paintball: Co-located, Opt-in
- **Description:** Users in the same physical space play a game of paintball with virtual paint. All users can see the game objects, and users have a dashboard to view the game status.
- **Key Features:** Shared virtual state, real-time interaction, co-located users.

#### Multi-Team Whiteboards: Not (necessarily) Co-located, Opt-in
- **Description:** A collaborative AR whiteboard app where users in different physical locations can share and synchronize a whiteboard. Access control must be at least at the whiteboard level.
- **Key Features:** Synchronized virtual content, decoupled from the physical world, real-time updates.

#### Community Art: Co-located, Opt-out
- **Description:** Co-located users automatically see each other’s virtual art by default. Artists may choose to keep their art private while constructing it or allow the public to view but not edit their sculptures.
- **Key Features:** Public-by-default, fine-grained access control, co-located users.

#### Soccer Arena: Not Co-located, Opt-out
- **Description:** Users watch a virtual replica of a soccer game on their living room table. By default, all users see all aspects of the playing field, commentator annotations, and ads. Users may wish to block distracting ads or turn off annotations.
- **Key Features:** Non-co-located users, real-time updates, public-by-default.

### 2.2 Functionality Goals

From the above case studies, we derive a set of functionality design goals for multi-user AR apps and platforms:

- **Support Physically-Situated Sharing:** For co-located users, the platform must support a way of sharing virtual state and a mapping between virtual objects and the physical world.
- **Support Physically-Decoupled Sharing:** For non-co-located users, the platform must support sharing virtual content decoupled from the physical world.
- **Support Real-Time Sharing:** The platform must support low-latency updates of shared state among multiple users, without imposing an undue performance burden.

These goals are essential for the success of emerging multi-user AR applications and must be considered alongside security and privacy requirements.
