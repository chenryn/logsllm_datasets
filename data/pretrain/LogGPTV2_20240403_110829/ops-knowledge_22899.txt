We are new to the Python ecosystem and eager to start developing a small web application for Google App Engine. Currently, we are using Eclipse with the Google plugin and PyDev. We also plan to integrate the Django framework into our project. Here are our two main questions:

1. Could you recommend a comprehensive tutorial that will help us get started with Django in conjunction with App Engine?
2. We are in search of a development tool. It appears that while Eclipse, with PyDev, can support either Django projects or App Engine projects, it does not seem to handle both simultaneously. Are there any other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that can accommodate this requirement?

**Response:**

As @MatToufotu suggested, it would be beneficial to begin with the Django integration documentation provided in the App Engine official documentation. This resource should provide a solid foundation for combining these two technologies.

Regarding your IDE concerns, I recommend sticking with Eclipse and PyDev. The Django-Nonrel project is designed specifically to facilitate the use of Django on non-relational databases, such as those supported by App Engine. Projects created with Django-Nonrel are essentially standard Django projects with added support for App Engine. PyDev is capable of handling both Django and App Engine projects effectively, so you should be able to manage both within the same environment. If you still find the need for an alternative, you might consider using PyCharm, which has robust support for both Django and Google App Engine.
