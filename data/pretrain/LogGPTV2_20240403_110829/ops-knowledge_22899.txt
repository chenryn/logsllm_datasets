User: We are new to the python world and would like to get started a s soon a possible and develop a little web app for app engine. We are using Eclipse + Google plugin + Pydev.
We also would like to start using Django framework and we have two questions:
1. We are looking for a good tutorial which will put us on the right track with Django + app engine?
2. We are looking for a dev tool, apperently Eclipse with Pydev support either Django project or App engine project but not together, is there any other IDE which can solve this problem?
Assistant: As @MatToufotu suggested you start with the django integration document in the appengine documentation. I would say you should stick with eclipse and pydev, as django-nonrel project created are nothing but pure django project with support for appengine, pydev can handle both of them with ease........
