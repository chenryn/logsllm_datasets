User: How to check network performance and faults with network diagnostic tools?
Assistant: 1. Use the ping tool to detect the network The Ping tool is a network diagnostic tool that comes with the Windows system, and it is also the most commonly used diagnostic network tool. It can help you test whether your network can be connected normally, detect network connection speed and diagnose problems such as network packet loss. How to use: Open the command prompt window, enter ping plus the URL or IP address to be detected, and press Enter to detect. For example, enter ping www.baidu.com 2. Use the tracert tool to detect the network The Tracert tool can help you determine the network communication path, and can also help you find the source of network connection problems. It can detect the number of nodes, router addresses and response times that the network needs to pass through to connect to the target server. How to use: Open the command prompt window, enter tracert plus the URL or IP address to be detected, and press Enter to detect. For example, enter tracert www.baidu.com 3. Use network speed test tools There are some online network speed test tools (such as Speedtest.net), which can test parameters such as network download speed, upload speed and delay, and provide you with more accurate network performance analysis. How to use: Visit the website of the online speed test tool, click to start the test, and wait for the test result. 4. Use a network analyzer A network analyzer is a software tool for capturing, analyzing and reporting network data. It can help you diagnose network faults, analyze network traffic, monitor network security and other issues. How to use: Use a network analyzer tool to capture network data packets, and analyze and view the data packets. 5. Use Network Monitor Network Monitor is a software used to monitor network traffic, which can help you track network bandwidth, connection speed, network quality and traffic distribution. How to use: Install and open the network monitor, follow the instructions to set up the operation, and then you can monitor the network status in real time.
