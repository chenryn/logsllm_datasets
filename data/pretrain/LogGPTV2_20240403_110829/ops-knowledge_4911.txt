User: I am using python with Django to develop application on google app engine.
Now my entity in data store contain millions or billions of record and I want to count those records in real time.
By using count() it takes more time then what I can afford
I want to count those record with in 2 or 3 second..
So can any one tell me what I should have to use to improve performance?
Assistant: Store the count in another entity (named Statistics for example), and modify your application so that the stored count is updated each time a new entity is inserted or deleted.
