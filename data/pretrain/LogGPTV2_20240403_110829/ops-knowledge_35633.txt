Question: "In C++ programming, ensuring the correct inclusion of header files is important for application security. Which of the following scenarios could potentially create a security risk if the developer uses an incorrect header file inclusion syntax?"
 "A": "The program might fail to compile, leading to a delay in the development process."
 "B": "The compiler may include the wrong version of a library, possibly containing known vulnerabilities."
 "C": "A missing library could cause the program to crash at runtime if the functions from the library are called."
 "D": "Including a local header file instead of a system library could expose the application to malicious code injection if the local file is tampered with."
