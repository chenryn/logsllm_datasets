I have been attempting to build Python 3.1.1 on my MacBook Pro, running Snow Leopard, using the `--enable-framework` and `--enable-universalsdk` options, but without success. Despite ensuring that I have the latest Xcode version for Snow Leopard and the 10.4u SDK installed, I am encountering issues during the compilation process. The errors seem to be related to the 10.4 SDK, specifically with headers for `wchar`, `cursor`, and `ncursor`. 

While I was able to successfully compile Python using a standard `configure` command, and most of the tests passed, I find this approach too straightforward and not sufficiently challenging. I am curious if anyone else has attempted to build Python 3.1.1 on a Mac running Snow Leopard and encountered similar issues.

Regarding Kenneth Reitz's solution, it did not work for me. The installation process itself completed without any issues, but my default `PATH` still points to `/usr/bin/python` (version 2.6.1). I recall that we should modify our `~/.profile` to point to the new Python framework, but I expected the installer to handle this automatically, which it did not.

The directory `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/bin` does exist, so I could add it to my `PATH`. However, I am puzzled as to why the Python binary in that directory crashes when I try to run it. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to resolve this issue at the moment.
