User: I've spent some time today playing with getting the source for python 3.1.1 to build on my MacBook Pro using the --enable-framework and --enable-universalsdk options with no success. I will humbly admit that I have no real clue why I can't compile 3.1.1 on Snow Leopard, I did make sure to get the new Xcode version for Snow Leopard, and made sure I also installed the 10.4u SDK. It seems to be choking on the 10.4 SDK during the make stage, and has several error regarding headers for wchar, cursor, and ncursor during the configure stage. I have been able to get a make from a plain configure, and most the test pass, but that just isn't challenging enough. Has anyone else attempted to build python 3.1.1 on a Mac running Snow Leopard
Assistant: Kenneth Reitz's soluton doesn't work for me. In fact, the install works fine but my default PATH still points to /usr/bin/python (v2.6.1.). I vaguely recall that we should be modifying our ~/.profile to point to /.../Frameworks and I expected the installer to do this for me (nope).
Anyway, /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1/bin exists so we could add it.
But I'm curious why the python bin in there does a crash and burn on me.
No time to resolve this now. Bye.
