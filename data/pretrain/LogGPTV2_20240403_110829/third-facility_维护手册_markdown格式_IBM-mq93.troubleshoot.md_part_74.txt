### IBM MQ Troubleshooting and Support

#### Submitting a Case with IBM
When you open a case with IBM, you can include additional IBM MQ troubleshooting information (MustGather data) that you have collected to help with the investigation. In addition to the information described in this section, IBM Support may request further details on a case-by-case basis.

#### Recovering After a Failure
Follow these procedures to recover from a serious problem.

##### About This Task
Use the recovery methods described here if you cannot resolve the underlying issue using the diagnostic techniques outlined in the "Troubleshooting and Support" section. If your problem persists, contact your IBM Support Center.

##### Procedure
Refer to the following links for instructions on how to recover from different types of failures:

- **Disk Drive Failures**: [Page 476](#disk-drive-failures)
- **Damaged Queue Manager Object**: [Page 477](#damaged-queue-manager-object)
- **Damaged Single Object**: [Page 477](#damaged-single-object)
- **Automatic Media Recovery Failure**: [Page 477](#automatic-media-recovery-failure)

### Disk Drive Failures
You might encounter issues with a disk drive containing either the queue manager data, the log, or both. Common problems include data loss or corruption. The three cases differ only in the part of the data that survives, if any.

**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Check Directory Structure**: First, check the directory structure for any damage and, if necessary, repair it. If you lose queue manager data, the queue manager directory structure might be damaged. Re-create the directory tree manually before restarting the queue manager.
2. **Queue Manager Data Files**: If damage has occurred to the queue manager data files but not to the log files, the queue manager should be able to restart. However, if the log files are damaged, the queue manager will likely fail to restart.
3. **Recovery Based on Logging Type**:
   - **Major Damage to Directory Structure or Log**: Remove all old files back to the QMgrName level, including configuration files, the log, and the queue manager directory. Restore the last backup and restart the queue manager.
   - **Linear Logging with Media Recovery**: Ensure the directory structure is intact and restart the queue manager. Use MQSC commands like `DISPLAY QUEUE` to check for damaged objects and use the `rcrmqobj` command to recover them. For example:
     ```sh
     rcrmqobj -m QMgrName -t all *
     ```
   - **Linear Logging with Undamaged Log**: Restore a backup of the queue manager data, leaving the existing log files and log control file unchanged. Starting the queue manager applies the changes from the log to bring it back to its state when the failure occurred.
   - **Circular Logging**: If the log files are damaged, restore the queue manager from the latest backup and restart it. Check for and re-define damaged objects. If the log files are not damaged, the queue manager should restart normally, and you must identify and delete/redefine damaged objects.

### Damaged Queue Manager Object
If a queue manager object is damaged, the queue manager performs a preemptive shutdown. Recovery depends on the logging type:

- **Linear Logging**: Restart the queue manager; media recovery of the damaged object is automatic.
- **Circular Logging**: Restore the last backup of the queue manager data and log, and restart the queue manager.

### Damaged Single Object
If a single object is reported as damaged during normal operation, for linear and replicated logging, you can re-create the object from its media image. For circular logging, you must delete and redefine the object.

### Automatic Media Recovery Failure
If a local queue required for queue manager startup with a linear log is damaged and automatic media recovery fails, restore the last backup of the queue manager data and log, and restart the queue manager.

### Example Recovery Procedures on z/OS
This section provides reference procedures for various recovery scenarios. Error conditions are grouped into categories, and each category includes specific problems and where to find more information.

| Problem Category | Problem | Where to Look Next |
|------------------|---------|--------------------|
| Shared Queue | Conflicting definitions for both private and shared queues | [Shared Queue Problems](#shared-queue-problems) |
| Active Log | Dual logging is lost, active log stopped, I/O errors | [Active Log Problems](#active-log-problems) |
| Archive Log | Insufficient DASD space, offload task termination, allocation problems | [Archive Log Problems](#archive-log-problems) |
| BSDS | Errors opening BSDS, log content mismatch, I/O errors | [BSDS Problems](#bsds-problems) |
| Page Set | Full page set, I/O errors | [Page Set Problems](#page-set-problems) |
| Coupling Facility and Db2 | Storage full, system failures | [Coupling Facility and Db2 Problems](#coupling-facility-and-db2-problems) |
| Unit of Work | Long-running units of work | [Problems with Long-Running Units of Work](#problems-with-long-running-units-of-work) |
| IMS | Abnormal application termination, adapter connection issues | [IMS-Related Problems](#ims-related-problems) |
| Hardware | Media recovery procedures | [Hardware Problems](#hardware-problems) |

### Shared Queue Problems
If IBM MQ discovers that a page set-based queue and a shared queue of the same name are defined, it issues an error message. To resolve, delete one version of the queue. If messages need to be preserved, use the `MOVE QLOCAL` command to move them to the other queue.

### Active Log Problems
This section covers various active log issues, including dual logging loss, active log stop, I/O errors, and log fullness. Each problem includes symptoms, system actions, and operator actions to resolve the issue.

- **Dual Logging Lost**: Check the offload process and define additional data sets if needed.
- **Active Log Stopped**: Resolve the issue by modifying the BSDS active log inventory.
- **Active Log Data Set Damaged**: Rename and replace the damaged data set, and update the BSDS.
- **Write I/O Errors**: Shut down the queue manager after the next offload and add a replacement using Access Method Services (AMS).
- **Read I/O Errors**: Address the error and ensure the log data set is accessible.

By following these procedures, you can effectively recover from various types of failures and ensure the smooth operation of your IBM MQ environment.
