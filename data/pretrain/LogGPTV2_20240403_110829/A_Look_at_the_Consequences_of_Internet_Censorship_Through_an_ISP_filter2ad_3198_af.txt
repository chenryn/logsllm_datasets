YouTube to other video sharing sites. Most local content is now
served through embedded links of unblocked video providers: em-
bedded links pointing to YouTube drop from an average of around
83% to 73% the day of block (18Sep12), to about 51% 11 months
later (02Aug13), with DailyMotion getting ≈ 32% of embedded
links and Tune.pk jumping from virtually no embedding to nearly
11%.
The drop in the percentage of embedded YouTube links also
leads to search engines adjusting their page ranks for localized
searches. For example, a manual search (country-speciﬁc via
google.com.pk) for top-5 local television shows reveals that
the top results point to Tune.pk and DailyMotion, while a search
for non-local content (top-5 television shows in USA) returns top
results referencing YouTube.
In summary, the censored video content provider loses trafﬁc and
revenue to competing non-censored sites in multiple ways: direct
reduction of trafﬁc, local content providers moving their hosted
channels to alternate providers, reduced embedded referencing in
third-party pages, and lower page rank for localized search. The
provider potentially also loses revenue due to the increased expense
of serving the content via the distribution channels available to cir-
cumventers. For non-censored providers, these considerations may
provide an incentive to take long-term control over local content.
For example, DailyMotion has recently moved to partner with the
largest ISP in the country [15].
7.2 Porn Content
For each trace, we ranked the porn sites in accordance with their
trafﬁc served into the country, measured using the methodology
described in Section 5. Table 10 shows the top-5 coded porn do-
mains for each trace. We observe that prior to blocking, globally
popular domains [2] top the list. After the blocking event, new
players emerge and take the top spots. In most cases, these new
players were non-existent in previous traces (indicated with bold
in the table), and their relative distribution across post-block traces
vary inconsistently. (We do see a few domains, such as X, S and
R, that appear in the top-5 for more than one trace.) We speculate
that users are familiar with a few favorite porn websites, but, after
blocking, ﬁnd out about alternatives through search engines, hence
the variety in the top ranked sites. This possibility ﬁts with the ﬁnd-
ing in Section 6 that after landing on a block page, porn users tend
to perform content-speciﬁc search queries.
Similar to the non-porn video sharing sites, censoring a porn site
also impairs its revenue share from within the censored region. In
Table 11 we analyze the bandwidth distribution among blocked and
unblocked porn websites. We observe that the bulk of the band-
width is captured by unblocked porn domains. (An exception to
the case is ¯A, which appears in a subsequent trace despite being
blocked in 21Dec11—circumvention is made possible by obtain-
ing correct IP addresses via non-local resolvers.) The popularity of
new porn domains can also be explained by the fact that after the
initial introduction of the porn blacklist (21Dec11), there seems to
be no aggressive strategy by the censor to block new popular porn
content.
8.
IMPACT ON SERVICE PROVIDERS
In this section we assess the consequences of the censorship
events on ISPs. We examine this in terms of analyzing the oper-
ator’s web caching behavior, focusing on the video content from
the four major providers, since our pre-block traces indicate that
videos constitute the content (≈ 95%) served by the ISP’s cache
servers.14
Table 12 lists the top-5 ASNs serving video content for each of
the traces.15 Prior to the YouTube blocking, the top ASN is the lo-
cal ISP—on average its caching servers provided 76% of the video
content. On the day of blocking, we still see the ISP’s caching
servers providing a small fraction of YouTube video content. This
leakage indicates that, initially, the ISP’s censorship implementa-
tion was incomplete; its caching servers had not completely ﬂushed
cached YouTube content, and hence still served it upon request.
(Recall that the block was put in place on the day of capture; some
users could potentially get correct answers for YouTube from their
local DNS cache, or by using alternate DNS resolvers as previously
discussed.)
Moving forward 11 months, the local ISP completely falls off the
charts to be replaced by CDNs serving DailyMotion and Tune.pk
videos.
Indeed, we ﬁnd the ISP’s cache servers completely ab-
sent from 02Aug13, and the ISP conﬁrmed to us that the systems
no longer provided any utility. Based on discussions with the ISP
operators, we learned two reasons for this. First, Google had pro-
vided free caching servers to Pakistani ISPs, infrastructure tailored
speciﬁcally to YouTube-caching. The other video content providers
do not offer such free caching solutions, leaving it difﬁcult for the
local ISPs to justify the cost of deploying and maintaining custom
solutions for the providers’ content. Second, the drastic decrease
in unencrypted video content (Table 7) made it hard to justify the
beneﬁts of caching, since ISPs cannot in general cache encrypted
content. The ISPs instead turned to the option of leasing more
upstream bandwidth, rather than buying and maintaining caching
servers.
Consequently, today all video content is primarily fetched from
the servers of their respective providers. Indeed, the operators we
acquired traces from had to purchase additional Internet bandwidth
after the block.
9. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have studied the impact of Internet censorship on major
stakeholders (service providers, content providers, and end users)
in the context of two major censorship events in Pakistan, the block
of porn content in 2011, and of YouTube in 2012. To this end,
we analyzed home and SOHO trafﬁc before, during, and after the
censorship events, from the vantage point of a mid-size ISP in a
large metropolitan area. As the foundation of our analysis, we de-
14We establish this by looking at the distribution of Content
Type served by the ISP’s caching servers.
15Labovitz noted that content delivery shifted to European servers
after MegaUpload servers in North America were seized [28]. Our
study focuses on alternate content providers when the primary has
been blocked, and the implications of their infrastructural arrange-
ments on an operator.

veloped methodologies to identify censorship activity within our
packet traces with high conﬁdence.
We observed that blocking of porn content caused increases in
encrypted trafﬁc (Table 7) but primarily users turned to alternative
sites (Table 10). In contrast, YouTube blocking caused a major shift
towards increased encrypted trafﬁc, indicating that users resorted
to circumvention mechanisms to continue their access. In addition,
we ﬁnd this shift well underway already on the day that the gov-
ernment imposed censorship, indicating that a portion of users can
very rapidly adapt to the introduction of new blocking mechanisms.
Censorship of YouTube also affected the ﬁnancial landscape
of video content providers (Table 8). New players emerged
and completely took over the video-sharing market that previ-
ously was almost wholly owned by YouTube prior to its blocking.
This shift also had consequences for ISPs that previously served
video content primarily from YouTube caches (freely provided by
Google) hosted within their own networks. Post-YouTube block-
ing, the ISPs must fetch video content through their upstream tran-
sit provider, reﬂecting an increase in bandwidth costs. After the
YouTube blocking was implemented at the local-ISP level (using
DNS spooﬁng), we observe a shift away from the use of the local
ISP’s DNS resolvers, dropping from more than 90% pre-blocking
to about 70% post-blocking. We note that such a shift somewhat
erodes a nation’s overall control over its Internet trafﬁc as users
transfer their base of trust (i.e., DNS resolution) to parties outside
the country.
Following up on this work, we plan to analyze additional data
from a different ISP in another large city in Pakistan to assess trends
seen across cities and providers. The expectation in Pakistan is that
porn blocking will continue in the future, but YouTube censorship
will soon end [16]. If that indeed happens, it will be illuminating
to study whether the proportion of encrypted trafﬁc returns to pre-
censorship levels; whether users continue to outsource their DNS
resolution; and the degree to which video trafﬁc distribution be-
tween YouTube and alternate video sharing sites readjusts.
