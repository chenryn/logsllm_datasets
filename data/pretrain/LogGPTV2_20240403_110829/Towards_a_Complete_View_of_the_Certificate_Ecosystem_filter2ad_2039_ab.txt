### Certificate Universe Overview

Our certificate "universe" encompasses 16,989,236 unique and valid certificates from eight different perspectives. These certificates cover 32,454,062 Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) across 12,673,515 sites, as defined by the Public Suffix List [25]. The two largest datasets in this study are the Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and the Censys snapshot. The CT logs contain 15,374,936 certificates, representing 90.5% of the total certificates observed. Censys, on the other hand, captures 6,448,588 certificates, providing 38% coverage of the total certificate universe. When combined, these two perspectives offer 99.4% coverage of all observed certificates and 99.7% coverage of sites.

### Certificates Missing from CT

Table 2 highlights the certificates missing from CT logs. Some issuers, such as GoDaddy, have a lower rate of their certificates appearing in CT logs compared to the general population. This is also true for mail, `*`, and vpn subdomain certificates.

| **Certificates Missing from CT** | **Count** | **Fraction Missing** | **Fraction of Universe** |
|----------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| All                              | 1,614,300 | 9.5%                | 9.5%                    |
| GoDaddy                          | 314,966   | 19.5%               | 2.0%                    |
| cPanel                           | 120,907   | 7.5%                | 0.7%                    |
| Thawte                           | 56,078    | 3.5%                | 0.3%                    |
| Starfield                        | 38,220    | 2.4%                | 0.2%                    |
| Other                            | 1,084,129 | 67.2%               | 6.4%                    |
| Mail                             | 188,109   | 11.6%               | 0.7%                    |
| *                                | 142,303   | 8.8%                | 0.8%                    |

| www                              | 147,588   | 9.1%                | 0.9%                    |

### Certificates Missing from Censys

Table 3 shows the certificates missing from Censys. Let's Encrypt reports all certificates to CT, even those never served, while Cloudflare certificates are only served with Server Name Indication (SNI).

| **Certificates Missing from Censys** | **Count** | **Fraction Missing** | **Fraction of Universe** |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| All                                  | 10,540,648 | 62.0%               | 62.0%                   |
| Letâ€™s Encrypt                        | 4,401,674 | 41.8%               | 23.5%                   |
| CloudFlare                           | 2,381,940 | 22.6%               | 13.9%                   |
| Other                                | 3,757,050 | 35.6%               | 22.1%                   |

### SNI Behavior

Table 4 illustrates the behavior of SNI. 77% of active domains extracted from CT logs accepted connections without SNI, but only 35% served the same certificate when contacted with SNI.

| **SNI Behavior** | **Count** | **Percentage** |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| FQDNs from CT    | 20,305,155 | 100%           |
| With SNI         | 15,598,532 | 77%            |
| Without SNI      | 7,021,206  | 35%            |
| Different Certificate | 8,577,326 | 42%          |

### Limits of Certificate Transparency

While CT is the largest perspective, it still misses 9.5% of the certificate universe, including 29.6% of GoDaddy certificates and 28.4% of cPanel certificates. None of the CAs in the table submit domain-validated (DV) certificates to public logs. In contrast, CT captures 99.3% of Cloudflare certificates and 100% of Let's Encrypt certificates.

CT is skewed towards web content and away from other TLS-based services, such as webmail, that might not be linked to by websites Google crawls. For example, CT misses 20.8% of certificates with the subdomain `mail` and 50.8% of certificates with a subdomain containing `vpn`. In contrast, CT only misses 4.3% of certificates with the subdomain `www`.

### Limits of Censys

The Censys snapshot covers only 38% of our certificate universe. Two sources account for approximately 64% of the missing certificates. As shown in Table 3, 90.8% of Let's Encrypt certificates are absent from Censys, accounting for 42% of the certificates missed by Censys and 23.5% of the certificate universe. Let's Encrypt submits all issued certificates to CT, but many of these certificates are inaccessible without SNI or are not served on public sites.

Cloudflare accounts for 17% of all certificates in this study, but Censys misses 81% of these, resulting in an exclusion of 13.9% of the certificate universe. We manually confirmed that the vast majority of Cloudflare certificates are only accessible through SNI. This makes sense because most Censys certificates are found through IPv4 scans that do not include SNI information.

### Sites Requiring SNI

To measure the impact of SNI, we performed two scans over all FQDNs contained in valid certificates in the CT logs. We scanned 30 million domain names and were able to complete successful HTTPS handshakes with 68% using SNI. As shown in Table 4, only 77% of domains that accepted a connection made with SNI accepted connections without it, and only 35% returned the same certificate as when SNI was used. This further demonstrates that scanning without SNI misses a substantial fraction of websites.

When limiting the scope to certificates discovered through Alexa Top Million scanning, IP-based scanning misses 27% of certificates and 65% of sites due to a lack of SNI. Combined scans of CT and IPv4 provide 98.5% of the certificates presented in our Alexa Top Million scan.

### Passive Traffic Monitoring

The ICSI Notary perspective is derived from passive monitoring of network traffic. It includes certificates actually seen on the wire, differing significantly from our other perspectives. Passive monitoring contains certificates from IPv6 connections. We encountered 822,338 server IP addresses in our Notary dataset, with 8.2% (67,725) being IPv6 addresses, comprising 13% of the observed connections. There were 4,512 certificates that were only encountered on IPv6 addresses, but only 218 of them were not observed in any other perspective. This suggests that IPv6 does not significantly impact conclusions drawn from scanning, but further measurement is necessary to verify this claim.

Only 9.7% of connections in the Notary dataset did not use SNI. In total, we saw 3,246,725 unique SNI values. The Notary saw only 3,805 certificates that were not observed by any other perspective, likely due to certificate changes during the longer passive measurement interval. This is supported by the fact that only 34% of the certificates were encountered at all during the last week of the measurement interval. Furthermore, 75% were issued by Cloudflare, which rotates certificates quickly.
