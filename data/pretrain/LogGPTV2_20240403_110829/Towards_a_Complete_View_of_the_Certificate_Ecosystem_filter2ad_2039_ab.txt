Our certiﬁcate “universe” consists of 16,989,236 unique,
valid certiﬁcates from our eight perspectives. These certiﬁ-
cates contain 32,454,062 FQDNs from 12,673,515 sites (as
deﬁned by the public sufﬁx list [25]). The CT logs and Cen-
sys snapshot are the two largest datasets. The CT logs contain
15,374,936 certiﬁcates (90.5% of certiﬁcates observed in this
study). Censys sees 6,448,588 certiﬁcates— 38% coverage of

3.1 Limits of Certiﬁcate Transparency
While CT is by far the largest perspective, it still misses
9.5% of the certiﬁcate universe, including 29.6% of GoDaddy
certiﬁcates and 28.4% of cPanel certiﬁcates, as shown in
Table 2. None of the CAs in the table submit domain validated
(DV) certiﬁcates to public logs. In contrast, CT captures
99.3% of CloudFlare certiﬁcates and 100% of Let’s Encrypt
certiﬁcates.
We also ﬁnd that CT is skewed towards web content and
away from other TLS-based services, such as webmail, that
might not be linked to by websites Google crawls. For ex-
ample, we ﬁnd that CT misses 20.8% of certiﬁcates with

main containing vpn. In contrast, CT only misses 4.3% of
certiﬁcates with the subdomain www.
3.2 Limits of Censys
The Censys snapshot only covers 38% of our certiﬁcate
universe. Two sources are responsible for approximately 64%
of the missing certiﬁcates. As shown in Table 3, 90.8% of
Let’s Encrypt certiﬁcates are absent from Censys, accounting
for 42% of the certiﬁcates missed by Censys and 23.5% of
the certiﬁcate universe. Let’s Encrypt submits all issued
certiﬁcates to CT, but it appears that many of these certiﬁcates
are inaccessible without SNI or are not served on public sites.
CloudFlare accounts for 17% of all certiﬁcates in this study,
but Censys misses 81% of these, resulting in an exclusion of
13.9% of the certiﬁcate universe. We manually conﬁrmed that
the vast majority of CloudFlare certiﬁcates are only accessible
through SNI. This intuitively makes sense because most
Censys certiﬁcates are found through IPv4 scans that do not
include SNI information.
3.3 Sites Requiring SNI
In order to directly measure the impact of SNI, we per-
formed two scans over all FQDNs contained in valid cer-
tiﬁcates in the CT logs. We scanned 30 million domain
names, and were able to complete successful HTTPS hand-
shakes with 68% using SNI. As shown in Table 4, only 77%
of domains that accepted a connection made with SNI ac-
cepted connections without it, and only 35% returned the
same certiﬁcate as when SNI was used. This further shows
that scanning without SNI misses a substantial fraction of
websites.
In order to understand if this discrepancy applies to com-
monly visited sites, we can limit the scope of our comparison
to certiﬁcates discovered through Alexa Top Million scanning,
as shown in Table 5. Even for these popular sites, IP-based
scanning misses 27% of certiﬁcates and 65% of sites, due to
a lack of SNI—a massive difference compared to the 0.7%
that Durumeric et al. found in 2013 [11]. Notably, scans
of CT and IPv4 combined provide 98.5% of the certiﬁcates
presented in our Alexa Top Million scan.
3.4 Passive Trafﬁc Monitoring
The ICSI Notary perspective is derived from passive moni-
toring of network trafﬁc. It only includes certiﬁcates actually
seen on the wire, and therefore differs signiﬁcantly from our
other perspectives.
In contrast to our active scans, passive monitoring contains
certiﬁcates from IPv6 connections. We encountered 822,338
server IP addresses in our Notary dataset. Of these, 8.2%
(67,725) were IPv6 addresses, comprising 13% of the ob-
served connections. There were 4,512 certiﬁcates that were
only encountered on IPv6 addresses, but only 218 of them
were not observed in any other perspective. This suggests
that IPv6 does not impact conclusions drawn from scanning
signiﬁcantly, but as our passive dataset is relatively restricted,
further measurement is necessary to verify this claim. Under-
scoring the importance of SNI discussed in Section 3.3, only
9.7% of connections in the Notary dataset did not use SNI.
In total, we saw 3,246,725 unique SNI values.
The Notary saw only 3,805 certiﬁcates that were not ob-
served by any other perspective. We believe these are due to
certiﬁcate changes during the longer passive measurement
interval. This is supported by the fact that only 34% of the
certiﬁcates were encountered at all during the last week of
the measurement interval. Furthermore, 75% were issued by
CloudFlare, which rotates certiﬁcates quickly.
