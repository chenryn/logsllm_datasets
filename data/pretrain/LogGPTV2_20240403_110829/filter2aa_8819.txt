# Public Blockchain Security Overview

## Definition
A public blockchain is characterized by its unrestricted access, allowing anyone with an internet connection to send transactions and participate as a validator. Validators play a crucial role in executing the consensus protocol, which ensures the integrity and security of the network. These networks typically incentivize participants through economic rewards, often employing either a Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm.

Among the most well-known and largest public blockchains are the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.
