With current 0.5 master:
    julia> map(Float32, [3,4,5])
    3-element Array{Float32,1}:
     3.0
     4.0
     5.0
    julia> broadcast(Float32, [3,4,5])
    3-element Array{Int64,1}:
     3
     4
     5
We presumably want to return a `Float32` array in both cases?
cc: @ViralBShah: this affects the case you asked about in #8450, since my
`f.(x...)` implementation in #15032 is equivalent to `broadcast`.
