With the current version 0.5 of Julia, the following behaviors are observed:

```julia
julia> map(Float32, [3,4,5])
3-element Array{Float32,1}:
 3.0
 4.0
 5.0

julia> broadcast(Float32, [3,4,5])
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 3
 4
 5
```

In both cases, it is expected that the output should be an array of `Float32` values. However, `broadcast` currently returns an `Array{Int64,1}` instead.

@ViralBShah: This issue affects the case you inquired about in #8450. The `f.(x...)` implementation in #15032 is equivalent to `broadcast`, and thus exhibits the same behavior.
