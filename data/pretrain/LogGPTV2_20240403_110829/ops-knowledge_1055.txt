User: I created a Hello World website in Google App Engine. It is using Django 1.1 without any patch.
Even though it is just a very simple web page, it takes long time and often it times out.
Any suggestions to solve this?
Note: It is responding fast after the first call.
Assistant: This is a horrible suggestion but I'll make it anyway:
Build a little client application or just use wget with cron to periodically access your app, maybe once every 5 minutes or so. That should keep Google from putting it into a dormant state.
I say this is a horrible suggestion because it's a waste of resources and an abuse of Google's free service. I'd expect you to do this only during a short testing/startup phase.
