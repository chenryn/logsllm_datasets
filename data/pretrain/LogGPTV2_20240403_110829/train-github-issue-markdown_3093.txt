I find myself in many situations executing Ansible to deploy systems but
frequently want to use the same credential set to SSH to those machines.
Currently for static hosts I am keeping two lists of the same information
`.ssh/config` and a hosts file.
So what I am suggesting would be to use Ansible's inventory to enable more
rapid SSH connections including but not limited to connecting to static hosts
and to dynamic inventory when the result set is a single node.
