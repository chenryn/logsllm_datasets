 **Problem Description**  
I faced an issue when upgrading my elasticsearch 2.3.3 to elasticsearch 5.1.1
by upgrading from apt repository. When elasticsearch 5.1.1 was upgraded and I
tried to start it, Elasticsearch did not start but in the STDOUT it never gave
a failure. Instead, in STDOUT it gave an OK message wwhich signifies that
elasticsearch has started succesfully.
**Problem Issue Identification**  
After debugging it, I found the issue causing it by traversing through the
/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log file. The issue was caused by using
elasticsearch-head plugin which was installed in ES-2.3.3 but as it is not
supported in ES-5.1.1, elasticsearch failed to start.
**Actual Behaviour**  
As an end-user I think we should not get an OK message if elasticsearch fails
to start and it should be mentioned in the Installation of Elasticsearch
documentation
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html).
**Note: This issue will occur for every plugins which were earlier supported
prior to ES-5.0.x version.**
Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Install any ES version prior to ES-5.x.x
  2. Install Elasticsearch-head in previous ES version (Validate its installation as it will be listed under $ES_HOME/plugins directory)
  3. Upgrade ES to ES-5.1.1
  4. Add ES as a service
  5. Run ES as a service. You will get following STDOUT console on command line:-
root@ubuntu:/home/yuvraj# sudo service elasticsearch start  
Starting Elasticsearch Server [2016-12-11T12:07:50,609][WARN
][o.e.c.l.LogConfigurator ] ignoring unsupported logging configuration file
[/etc/elasticsearch/logging.yml], logging is configured via
[/etc/elasticsearch/log4j2.properties]  
[ OK ]
