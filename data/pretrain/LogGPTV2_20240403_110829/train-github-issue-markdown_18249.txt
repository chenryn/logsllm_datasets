### Problem Description
I encountered an issue when upgrading Elasticsearch from version 2.3.3 to 5.1.1 using the APT repository. After the upgrade, when I attempted to start Elasticsearch, it did not start, even though the command line output indicated success with an "OK" message.

### Issue Identification
Upon further investigation, I discovered the root cause by examining the log file located at `/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log`. The problem was due to the presence of the `elasticsearch-head` plugin, which was installed in the previous version (Elasticsearch 2.3.3) but is not supported in Elasticsearch 5.1.1. This incompatibility prevented Elasticsearch from starting correctly.

### Expected Behavior
As an end-user, I believe that the system should not display an "OK" message if Elasticsearch fails to start. Instead, it should provide a clear error message. Additionally, this behavior and potential issues with incompatible plugins should be clearly documented in the Elasticsearch installation guide (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html).

### Note
This issue will occur for any plugins that were supported in versions prior to Elasticsearch 5.0.x but are not compatible with newer versions.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install any Elasticsearch version prior to 5.x.x.
2. Install the `elasticsearch-head` plugin in the older Elasticsearch version. Verify its installation by checking the `$ES_HOME/plugins` directory.
3. Upgrade Elasticsearch to version 5.1.1.
4. Add Elasticsearch as a service.
5. Start Elasticsearch as a service. You will see the following output on the command line:
   ```sh
   root@ubuntu:/home/yuvraj# sudo service elasticsearch start
   Starting Elasticsearch Server
   [2016-12-11T12:07:50,609][WARN ][o.e.c.l.LogConfigurator ] ignoring unsupported logging configuration file [/etc/elasticsearch/logging.yml], logging is configured via [/etc/elasticsearch/log4j2.properties]
   [ OK ]
   ```

### System Details
- **Elasticsearch Version**: 5.1.1
