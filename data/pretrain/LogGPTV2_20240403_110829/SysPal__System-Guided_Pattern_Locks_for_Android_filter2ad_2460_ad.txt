A. Pattern characteristics
1) Points used in patterns: Previous studies [22, 24]
demonstrated that people tend to select weak patterns that have
some common (guessable) characteristics; e.g., people prefer
using certain starting points and ending points.
To identify such common characteristics that could poten-
tially weaken the pattern security, we ﬁrst analyzed the usage
frequencies of each of the nine points in the 3×3 grid. Figure 4
shows the usage ratios of all 9 points across all ﬁve policies. In
all policies except for the Random policy, the most frequently
used point was 5 – it was more frequently used in all SysPal
policies (13.3–13.6%) compared to the Original policy
(12.0%). Overall, however, the usage frequencies of all points
across all policies (including Random) were somewhat evenly
distributed, and we did not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant
difference between point usage frequencies (all p = 1.0,
corrected FET).
We also analyzed the starting and ending point ratios in
patterns across all ﬁve policies. As shown in Figure 5, the
starting points for Original patterns were strongly biased
towards the upper leftmost point (point “1”), showing a ratio of
65.3% (this percentage is similar to what was reported in [22]).
The most popularly used starting points in all of the SysPal
policies were also the upper leftmost point, but it was used
much less compared to Original; those differences between
Original and all SysPal policies in the distribution of the
starting points were statistically signiﬁcant (all p < 0.05,
corrected FET). Further, all SysPal policies except 1-Point
showed signiﬁcantly different distributions of the starting
points against Random (all p < 0.001, corrected FET).
1-Point did not show statistically signiﬁcant difference
against Random (p = 1.0, corrected FET).
Figure 6 shows that the usage of the ending points was
also biased toward the lower rightmost point (point “9”) for
all policies except Random. However, we did not ﬁnd any
statistically signiﬁcant difference between all SysPal policies
and Random (all p = 1.0, corrected FET). Further, there was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference between Original and
all SysPal policies (all p = 1.0, corrected FET).

Fig. 7: Usage ratios for all possible segments.
Unexpectedly, the points used in the Random patterns were
slightly biased toward a few points as shown in Figures 4, 5
and 6. Our statistical tests show that the usage frequencies
of the 9 points for the Random patterns were not uniformly
distributed (p <0. 001, chi-square test). We surmise that this
may be due to one of the pattern setup instructions that allowed
Random participants to initialize (reset) given random pattern
unlimited number of times until they got a pattern they wanted
to use.
2) Segments used: Next, we analyzed the usage ratio of
frequently used segments. A segment is a line that connects
two points together. Figure 7 shows the usage ratios for
all possible segments: darker the color, higher the number
of segments used. The total number of segments used in
Original was 2,596, and the most frequently used segment
was (2, 3). It was used 175 times (6.92%). A few diagonal
lines, such as (9, 4) and (1, 8), were never used. All SysPal
policies showed similar characteristics: the most frequently
used segments were (2, 3) and (1, 2), and (i, i + 1) was more
frequently used than (i + 1, i) for all i = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8,
implying that most patterns were drawn from left to right.
We computed Shannon entropy on the usage frequency of
segments. The entropy value of usage frequency distribution
for segments of Original patterns was 5.074. This value
was relatively lower than the corresponding entropy values for
the SysPal policies, which were 5.185, 5.129, and 5.184, for
policies 1-Point, 2-Point, and 3-Point, respectively.
This implies that the segments used in the SysPal patterns
(for all three policies) were more evenly distributed than the
segments used in the Original patterns. The segments used
in the Random patterns had the highest entropy value of 5.753.
3) Positions of mandated points: SysPal policies require
users to use randomly assigned points upon selecting a pattern
but users can freely choose positions (indexes) in which those
points are used. This section analyzes how those mandated
points were used. Figure 8 shows the usage frequency ratios
of the mandated points used in each of the 9 positions.
The 1-Point participants used the mandated point mostly
in the ﬁrst position of their patterns (68.9%). 38.5% of the
2-Point participants used one of the two mandated points
in the ﬁrst position, and 17.4% used one of the mandated
points in the second position. The use of the mandated points
in different pattern positions for 2-Point seems to be more
evenly distributed than that of 1-Point but this may be
simply because there was one more mandated point that had
to be used. Interestingly, the usage frequency ratio for the
fourth position was quite high for 2-Point. This may be
because patterns with length 4 were frequently selected by the
2-Point participants (about 30%), and one of the mandated
points could have been used frequently as an ending point
in those patterns. The 3-Point participants used mandated
points less in the ﬁrst position, and used them more in the

second and third positions. Across all SysPal policies, there
seems to be a tendency to use the mandated points as the
starting point of their pattern.
4) Usage of mandated points: Next, we analyzed how man-
dated points were used upon selecting a SysPal pattern. First,
we looked at how often mandated points were used adjacent
to each other. For example, given 1 and 2 as mandated points,
if a pattern is 1–2–3–6, we considered those two mandated
points to be adjacently located. If a pattern is 1–4–5–2, those
two mandated points were not considered as adjacently located
points. For 2-Point, 33.6% of the participants selected
patterns that consisted of adjacently located mandated points.
Surprisingly, for 3-Point, 82.5% of the participants selected
patterns with at least two adjacently located mandated points.
Interestingly, 33.0% of the 3-Point patterns had all three
mandated points adjacently located to each other.
Second, we analyzed the number of patterns that used the
mandated points as the starting point and ending point. 32.8%
of the 2-Point participants and 36.4% of the 3-Point
participants created their patterns that way. Overall, our re-
sults indicate that the participants’ pattern selection behaviors,
including the way they choose starting and ending points,
were signiﬁcantly affected by the randomly-assigned mandated
points.
5) Distance between mandated points and other points: To
further analyze the usage behaviors of mandated points, we
compared the mean distances between the mandated points and
normal points (see Table VIII). For example, given 1 and 2 as
mandated points, if a pattern is 1–2–3–6, the distance between
the mandated points (i.e., “1” and “2”) is 1. If a pattern is 1–
4–5–2, the distance between the mandated points is 3. For our
analysis, we created two groups, one group called “Normal”
that comprises of segments that contain at least one normal
point, and another group called “Mandated” that comprises of
segments with two mandated points. Since by the deﬁnition
given above the Mandated group will be empty for 1-Point,
we only analyzed policies 2-Point and 3-Point.
The mean distance of two points in a segment
in the
Mandated group for 2-Point was 2.906 with a standard
deviation of 1.955. This was longer than the mean distance of
two points in a segment in the Normal group, which was 2.696
with a standard deviation of 0.625. There was a statistically
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups (p < 0.001,
corrected two-tailed unpaired t-test).
For policy 3-Point, however, the mean distance of two
points in a segment in the Normal group (μ = 2.720 and σ =
0.624) was longer than that of the Mandated group (μ = 2.286
and σ = 0.985). But the difference between the two groups
was not statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.37, corrected two-tailed
unpaired t-test).
In 32.7% of the 2-Point patterns, and 36.2% of the
3-Point patterns, mandated points were used as starting and
ending points at the same time. In 33.6% of the 2-Point pat-
terns, and 33.1% of the 3-Point patterns, all the mandated
points were directly connected (i.e., there was no intermediary
point in between). Furthermore, in 49.7% of the 3-Point
patterns, at least two mandated points were directly connected.
It is possible that, given mandated points, many participants
simply tried to select a pattern that connects the mandated
points with a minimal drawing effort.
B. Guessing entropy
To compare the robustness of the ﬁve policies against
guessing attacks, we calculated partial guessing entropy es-
timates [8] because some attackers may only be interested in
stealing just a fraction of an entire password set. This is a
popularly used technique for estimating the average number
(cid:4)
of trials needed to successfully guess a fraction (α) of an entire
i=1 pi ≥ α
password set. For 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, let μα = min
