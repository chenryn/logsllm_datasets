**Current behavior**
I do have a lazy loaded module which loads by default `LazyLoadedComponent`
when I go to `/lazy`. So far, it's OK.
This component contains 2 router-outlet :
And the `LazyLoadedModule` has the following routes :
    const routes = [
      {
          path: '',
          component: LazyLoadedComponent,
          children: [
              {
                  path: '',
                  component: NonAuxComponent
              },
              {
                  path: '',
                  component: AuxComponent,
                  outlet: 'aux'
              }
          ]
      }
    ];
When I go to `/lazy` I do have the 3 components loaded as expected.  
But, if I want to change the path to display the `AuxComponent` like that :
    {
       path: 'auxpath',
       component: AuxComponent,
       outlet: 'aux'
    }
And I try to go to `/lazy(aux:auxpath)` it's not working.
I also tried to hit that URL using the `routerLink` like that :
    Load an auxiliary route
But it's not working either.

Is this a bug with the router ? Is it just me missing out something here?
You can check out this Plunkr to make your own tests.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Plunkr :
  * Click on "Demo (click to lazy load the module)"
  * Once the module is loaded, click on "Load an auxiliary route"
  * The non auxiliary component is well displayed, the auxiliary component is not displayed
**Please tell us about your environment:**
Ubuntu 16.10  
VSC  
Yarn  
(But as this is also happening on Plunkr, not sure it's relevant).
