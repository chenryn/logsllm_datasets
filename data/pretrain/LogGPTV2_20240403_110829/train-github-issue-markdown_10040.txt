This may be a duplicate of Crash on macOS with Electron v3.1.6
But I don't know if the problem is the same as what they supposedly narrowed
it down to. Plus they never followed up with more testing.

### Expected Behavior
Use VSCode regularly without crashing
### Actual Behavior
Freezes up then crashes.
### To Reproduce
The best way to reproduce is using VSCode to run SQL code while using the
PostgreSQL Microsoft extension. Also need to install pgadmin (I use pgcli). I
can also provide SQL files to setup and use.
### Screenshots
None as of now
### Additional Information
I have had it crash on the newest VSCode version, but currently don't have a
saved bug report. I can try to get one if needed.
