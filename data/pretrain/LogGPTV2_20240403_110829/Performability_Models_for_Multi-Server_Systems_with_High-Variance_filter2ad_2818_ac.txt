Figure 3. Tail distribution of length of task-queue for

be shown that the probability mass function of the queue-
length distribution shows a (truncated) power-tail with ex-
ponent βi = i(α − 1) + 1, where α is the tail exponent of
the DOWN distribution for each server. The condition in
Eq. (4) can be reformulated in terms of the utilization ρ as

availability of the individual server in Fig. 5. A decrease
of the availability is thereby achieved by a reduction of the
mean UP duration, while at the same time increasing the
mean repair time accordingly, such that the average dura-
tion of an UP-DOWN cycle is kept constant. Note that not
the whole range of A between 0 and 1 can be covered, since
for the ﬁxed arrival rate λ = 1.8, the cluster becomes insta-
ble for values of A below approximately 31%, marked by
the vertical dashed-dotted line. Note also that for the used
choice of λ = 1.8 in Figure 5, and for the given settings
of δ = 0.2 and νp = 2, the mean service rate during long
repair times of both nodes simultaneously is ν2 = 0.72,
hence for any A 
λ − N νpδ
νp(1 − δ)
is only present, if and only if λ > N νpδ.
Although the discussion of blow-up points has been gen-
eral for any N ≥ 1, the numerical examples so far focused
on the case N = 2. Since for Hyperexponential distri-
butions with 2 states, larger settings of N can be easily
