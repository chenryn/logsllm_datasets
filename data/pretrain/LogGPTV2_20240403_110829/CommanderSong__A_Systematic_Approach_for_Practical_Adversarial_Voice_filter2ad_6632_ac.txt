5.1 Experiment Setup
The pure voice audio of the desired commands can be gen-
erated by any Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine (e.g., Google
text-to-speech [7], etc.) or recording human voice, as long
as it can be correctly recognized by Kaldi platform. We
also randomly downloaded 26 songs from the Internet. To
understand the impact of using different types of songs
as the carrier, we intended to choose songs from different
categories, i.e., popular, rock, rap, and soft music. Re-
garding the commands to inject, we chose 12 commonly
used ones such as “turn on GPS”, “ask Capital One to
make a credit card payment”, etc., as shown in Table 2.
Regarding the computing environment, one GPU server
(1075MHz GPU with 12GB memory, and 512GB hard
drive) was used.

5.2 Effectiveness
WTA Attack. In this WTA attack, we directly feed the
generated adversarial songs to Kaldi using its exposed
APIs, which accept raw audio ﬁle as input. Particularly,
we injected each command into each of the downloaded
26 songs using the approach proposed in Section 4.2. To-
tally we got more than 200 adversarial songs in the “WAV”
format and sent them to Kaldi directly for recognition. If
Kaldi successfully identiﬁed the command injected inside,
we denote the attack as successful.
Table 2 shows the WTA attack results. Each command
can be recognized by Kaldi correctly. The success rate
100% means Kaldi can decode every word in the desired
command correctly. The success rate is calculated as the
ratio of the number of words successfully decoded and
the number of words in the desired command. Note in the
case that the decoded word is only one character different
than that in the desired command, we consider the word
is not correctly recognized.
For each adversarial song, we further calculated the
average signal-noise ratio (SNR) against the original song
as shown in Table 2. SNR is a parameter widely used
to quantify the level of a signal power to noise, so we
use it here to measure the distortion of the adversarial
sample over the original song. We then use the following
equation SNR(dB) = 10log10(Px(t)/Pδ (t)) to obtain SNR,
where the original song x(t) is the signal while the per-
turbation δ (t) is the noise. Larger SNR value indicates a
smaller perturbation. Based on the results in Table 2, the
SNR ranges from 14∼18.6 dB, indicating that the pertur-
bation in the original song is less than 4%. Therefore, the
perturbation should be too slight to be noticed.
WAA Attack. To practically attack Kaldi over the air,
the ideal case is to ﬁnd a commercial IVC device imple-
mented based on Kaldi and play our adversarial samples
against the device. However, we are not aware of any
such IVC device, so we simulate a pseudo IVC device
based on Kaldi. In particular, the adversarial samples are
played by speakers over the air. We use the recording
functionality of iPhone 6S to record the audio, which is
sent to Kaldi API to decode. Overall, such a pseudo IVC
device is built using the microphone in iPhone 6S as the
audio recorder, and Kaldi system to decode the audio.
We conducted the practical WAA attack in a meeting
room (16 meter long, 8 meter wide, and 4 meter tall).
The songs were played using three different speakers in-
cluding a JBL clip2 portable speaker, an ASUS laptop
and a SENMATE broadcast equipment [16], to examine
the effectiveness of the injected random noise. All of
the speakers are easy to obtain and carry. The distance
between the speaker and the pseudo IVC device (i.e., the
microphone of the iPhone 6S) was set at 1.5 meters. We
chose two commands as in Table 3, and generated adver-
sarial samples. Then we played them over the air using
those three different speakers and used the iPhone 6S to
record the audios, which were sent to Kaldi to decode.
Table 3 shows the WAA attack results. For both of the
two commands, JBL speaker overwhelms the other two
with the success rate up to 96%, which might indicate its
sound quality is better than the other two. All the SNRs
are below 2 dB, which indicates slightly bigger perturba-
tion to the original songs due to the random noise from
the signal’s point of view. Below we will evaluate if such
“bigger” perturbation is human-noticeable by conducting
a survey.
Human comprehension from the survey. To evaluate
the effectiveness of hiding the desired command in the
song, we conducted a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk

(MTurk) [2], an online marketplace for crowdsourcing
intelligence. We recruited 204 individuals to participate
in our survey6. Each participant was asked to listen to
26 adversarial samples, each lasting for about 20 seconds
(only about four or ﬁve seconds in the middle is crafted to
contain the desired command.). A series of questions re-
garding each audio need to be answered, e.g., (1) whether
they have heard the original song before; (2) whether they
heard anything abnormal than a regular song (The four
options are no, not sure, noisy, and words different than
lyrics); (3) if choosing noisy option in (2), where they
believe the noise comes from, while if choosing words
different than lyrics option in (2), they are asked to write
down those words, and how many times they listened to
the song before they can recognize the words.

The entire survey lasts for about ﬁve to six minutes.
Each participant is compensated $0.3 for successfully
completing the study, provided they pass the attention
check question to motivate the participants concentrate on
the study. Based on our study, 63.7% of the participants
are in the age of 20∼40 and 33.3% are 40∼60 years old,
and 70.6% of them use IVC devices (e.g., Amazon Echo,
Google home, Smartphone, etc.) everyday.
Table 4 shows the results of the human comprehension
of our WTA samples. We show the average results for
songs belonging to the same category. The detailed re-
sults for each individual song can be referred to in Table 7
in Appendix. Generally, the songs in soft music cate-
gory are the best candidates for the carrier of the desired
command, with as low as 15% of participants noticed the

abnormality. None of the participants could recognize any
word of the desired command injected in the adversarial
samples of any category. Table 5 demonstrates the results
of the human comprehension of our WAA samples. On
average, 40% of the participants believed the noise was
generated by the speaker or like radio, while only 2.2%
of them thought the noise from the samples themselves.
In addition, less than 1% believed that there were other
words except the original lyrics. However, none of them
successfully identiﬁed any word even repeating the songs
several times.
5.3 Towards the Transferability
Finally, we assess whether the proposed CommanderSong
can be transfered to other ASR platforms.
Transfer from Kaldi to iFLYTEK. We choose iFLY-
TEK ASR system as the target of our transfer, due to its
popularity. As one of the top ﬁve ASR systems in the
world, it possesses 70% of the market in China. Some
applications supported by iFLYTEK and their downloads
on Google Play as well as the number of worldwide users
are listed in Table 8 in Appendix. In particular, iFLY-
TEK Input is a popular mobile voice input method, which
supports mandarin, English and personalized input [12].
iFLYREC is an online service offered by iFLYTEK to
convert audio to text [10]. We use them to test the trans-
ferability of our WAA attack samples, and the success
rates of different commands are shown in Table 6. Note

that WAA audio samples are directly fed to iFLYREC to

panion 2 speaker towards iFLYTEK Input running on
smartphone LG V20, or using JBL speaker towards iFLY-
TEK Input running on smartphone Huawei honor 8/MI

commands like open the door or good night can achieve
great transferability on both platforms. However, the com-
mand airplane mode on only gets 66% success rate on
iFLYREC, and 0 on iFLYTEK Input.
