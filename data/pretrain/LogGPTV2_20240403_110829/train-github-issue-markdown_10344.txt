The Geometric and Harmonic means have two sets of test cases in `test_stats`.
Ideally, the tests for related functions should occur in one place, not spread
across multiple suites. I think these tests should be reviewed and combined
into a single test suit where possible.
For reference, the tests covering the geometric mean are `TestGMean` and
`GeoMeanTestCase` / `TestGeoMean(GeoMeanTestCase)`. And for the harmonic mean
`TestHMean` and `HarMeanTestCase` / `TestHarMean(HarMeanTestCase)`
