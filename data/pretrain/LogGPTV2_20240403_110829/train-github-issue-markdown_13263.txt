# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.295]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2661.0
    Any other software? N/A
# Steps to reproduce
In #2647 I reported that the Github preview asset 0.4 hung when installing
behind a company proxy server. This was fixed by manually installing
dependency package: VCLibs.140.
Now, on installing Terminal Preview 0.5, using the GitHub release asset, the
same problem happens. There is no indication of the missing dependency. This
is on the same machine so I assume VCLibs.140 is still present.
