The order of input data is changed.  
For example:
    inputs = {'A': [1,2,3,4], 'B':[7,8,9,10]}
    A = fc.sequence_numeric_column('A')
    B = fc.sequence_numeric_column('B')
    columns = [A,B]
    seq_feature_layer = keras.experimental.SequenceFeatures(columns)
    seq_input, seq_len = seq_feature_layer(inputs)
And It prints like
    print(seq_input)
    > [[7, 1], [8, 2], [9, 3], [10,4]]
