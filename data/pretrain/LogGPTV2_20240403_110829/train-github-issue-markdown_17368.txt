While processing a large set of requests, `apparent_encoding()` works well for
quite a while but eventually hangs. All I have at this point is a traceback:
    File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 637, in apparent_encoding
    return chardet.detect(self.content)['encoding']
    File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/__init__.py", line 30, in detect
    u.feed(aBuf)
    File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/universaldetector.py", line 128, in feed
    if prober.feed(aBuf) == constants.eFoundIt:
    File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/charsetgroupprober.py", line 64, in feed
    st = prober.feed(aBuf)
    File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/sjisprober.py", line 74, in feed
    self._mContextAnalyzer.feed(aBuf[i + 1 - charLen:i + 3
I appreciate anything you can do to help.
