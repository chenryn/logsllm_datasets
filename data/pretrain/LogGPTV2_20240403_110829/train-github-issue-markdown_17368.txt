When processing a large set of requests, the `apparent_encoding()` function works well for a considerable period but eventually hangs. The only information I have at this point is the following traceback:

```python
File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 637, in apparent_encoding
    return chardet.detect(self.content)['encoding']

File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/__init__.py", line 30, in detect
    u.feed(aBuf)

File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/universaldetector.py", line 128, in feed
    if prober.feed(aBuf) == constants.eFoundIt:

File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/charsetgroupprober.py", line 64, in feed
    st = prober.feed(aBuf)

File "/opt/wsgi/.../ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/chardet/sjisprober.py", line 74, in feed
    self._mContextAnalyzer.feed(aBuf[i + 1 - charLen:i + 3])
```

I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide to resolve this issue.
