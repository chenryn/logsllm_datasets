our algorithms, the victim is the participant: i.e., the user
who runs the application.
If a participant does not grant
the type-1 permissions required for executing the selected
inference algorithms, no data point is collected for this par-
ticipant.
In other words, all the data points we collected
correspond to type-1 accessible proﬁles.
We devised inference algorithms that use diﬀerent types
of information as the basis of inference, and resemble real
security questions. Our inference algorithms are described in
the following. Note that in the description of the algorithms,
the basis of inference that is accessed in the victim’s proﬁle
for inferring her inaccessible information is underlined.
1. Birthday (birthday): A day when the participant re-
ceives a considerable number of birthday greetings on her
wall is inferred as her birthday.
2. Partner’s First Name (partner): A user who has the
highest number of appearances in the participant’s photo
albums (specially albums with captions containing “mar-
riage”, “wedding”, etc.), and is of the opposite gender, is
inferred to be the partner of the participant. By partner
we mean spouse, boy friend or girl friend.
3. Favorite Author (author): An author who authors the
majority of the books on the participant’s list of favorite
books is inferred to be her favorite author.
4. Favorite Movie Genre (genre): A genre that accounts
for the majority of the movies on the participant’s list of
favorite movies is inferred to be her favorite movie genre.
5. Youngest Sibling’s First Name (sibling): Access the
participant’s friends’ family information. The youngest
friend who has listed the participant in her family infor-
mation as a sibling is inferred to be the youngest sibling.
If no friend has identiﬁed the participant to be a sibling,
the youngest friend in the participant’s friends list who
shares the same family name as the participant is inferred
to be her youngest sibling.
In both cases above, if the
friends’ birthdays are not accessible, break tie randomly.
6. Hometown (hometown): The participant’s hometown is
inferred to be in the same town as her high school is.
If the participant does not list her high school in her
education information, then her college or university are
used for inference.
7. Oldest Friend (oldestF): Access the participant’s and her
friends’ education information. A friend who went to the
same high school as the participant did and, is in around
the same age as the participant is inferred to be her oldest
friend.
8. Political View (polView): Access the participant’s family
information. The prominent political view of the partic-
ipant’s close relatives (e.g., spouse) is inferred to be the
political view of the participant. If polView could not ac-
cess the political view of the participant’s relatives, then
the political views of all friends are consulted.
We do not claim that the above algorithms are particularly
sophisticated, but rather we aim at showing even such simple
algorithms can yield unintentional information disclosure.
6. ANALYSIS
In this section, we apply the analytical framework of Sec-
tion 4 to the data points we collected from our participants.
6.1 Classiﬁcation of User Proﬁles
Figure 1 depicts the distribution of the various classes of
proﬁles for each algorithm. All proﬁles are type-1 accessible
for all algorithms, i.e., if participant j does not grant the
type-1 permissions requested by algorithm i, then algorithm
i will not be executed on participant j’s proﬁle.
Only three algorithms require type-2 permissions: sib-
ling, polView and oldestF. Thus, all proﬁles are vacuously
type-2 accessible for the rest of the algorithms. The sibling
algorithm has a secondary inference rule that serves as a fall
back when the required type-2 permissions are not in place.
That is why to sibling all proﬁles are type-2 accessible. In
the case of oldestF, the required type-2 permissions happen
to be always granted in our empirical data due to the Face-
book default privacy settings. A similar reason is behind the
low number of type-2 accessible proﬁles for polView.
The higher number there are available proﬁles, the easier
the algorithm can ﬁnd an answer. For example, only 34.5%
of user proﬁles were available for author, whereas the ﬁgure
is more than doubled for hometown. It means the chance that
a user has at least one school added to her proﬁle is much
higher than the chance that she has at least one entry in her
list of favorite books. As a result, the number of potential
victims of hometown is larger than that of author.
Applicability is a more realistic metric for evaluating vul-
nerability of a proﬁle to inference algorithms. For instance,
despite partner returns at least one answer for 73.2% of the
participants, only 30.2% of the proﬁles are applicable, i.e.,
owners of the 69.8% of proﬁles are single and do not have
a signiﬁcant other. Hence, it is impossible for partner to
ﬁnd the right answer in such cases. Analyzing this class of
proﬁles gives us valuable insights on how many users are
potentially vulnerable to an inference attack. Figure 1 illus-
trates that except for polView, all the other algorithms have
quite a high number of applicable proﬁles.
6.2 Success Rates of Inference Algorithms
6.2.1 Success rate
Figure 2 depicts the success rates of the inference algo-
rithms as computed using the formulas in Table 1 when
α = 1. The result shows surprisingly high success rates
for some of our algorithms, even though their designs are
relatively straightforward. For example, the success rate of
birthday is 77.4% even for type-1 accessible user proﬁles.
This means, for 77.4% of the users who grant type-1 per-
missions to birthday (i.e., permission to access wall posts),
their birthdays can be successfully inferred. In addition, if
