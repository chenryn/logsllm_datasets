This is a tracking issue for the unstable `str_parse_error` and `utf8_error`
features in the standard library. Some various small error types popped up
once `FromStr` had an associated error type and haven't been considered too
closely for stabilization.
Some thoughts are:
  * Are the names of these types appropriate?
  * Are we covered in terms of future extensibility?
  * Are the relevant portions of the error exposed well?
