# Bug Report

## Current Behavior
An error occurs during the dynamic import process:
```
Module parse failed: 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level (45:8)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
```

The error is triggered by the following code snippet:
```typescript
ngAfterViewInit() {
    import('./df.tinymce.files')
        .then(() => {
            // Code here
        });
}
```

## Expected Behavior
Prior to version 4.29.0, the dynamic import was functioning as expected. The issue only started occurring with this specific version.

## Other Relevant Information
- Webpack version: v4.29.0
- Node.js version: v11.7.0
- Operating System: macOS
- Additional tools: TypeScript 3.2.2

Please let me know if you need any further details or if there are any steps I can take to resolve this issue.
