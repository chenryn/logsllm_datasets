User:  How do I troubleshoot network issues on my server, such as connection delays or packet loss?
Assistant: 1. Use the ping command to test network connectivity: Run the ping command to test the network connectivity between the server and the target host. Latency and packet loss can be tested. 2. Use the traceroute command to trace the route: The traceroute command can display the path of network packets from source to destination. By checking the router name and IP address, you can determine if there is network delay or packet loss. 3. View the network topology map: By viewing the network topology map, you can understand the relationship between devices in the network and the location of possible problems. 4. Check the network configuration: Check the network configuration of the server and router to ensure that the configuration is correct. For example, check settings such as IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS. 5. Analyze network traffic: Using network traffic analysis tools, you can identify network bottlenecks and traffic problems. For example, Wireshark can analyze TCP/IP packets. 6. Check the server load: If the server load is too high, it may cause network delay or packet loss. Use system monitor tools to check server load and troubleshoot issues. 7. Check the network device hardware: If there is a hardware failure, such as a bad network adapter or switch, it can cause network connection problems. Check the device hardware and make any necessary repairs or replacements.
