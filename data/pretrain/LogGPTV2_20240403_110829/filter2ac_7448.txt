### Title: US-22 Cautious: A Novel Exploitation Method as Nasty as Dirty Pipe, but Without the Pipe

**Abstract:**

The CVE-2022-0847 vulnerability, commonly known as "Dirty Pipe," is a critical flaw present in Linux kernel versions 5.8 and later. This vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate privileges by injecting data into arbitrary files, bypassing kernel address randomization and pointer integrity checks. The exploit built on this vulnerability can be easily adapted to affect all affected kernel versions without modification.

While Dirty Pipe is powerful, its exploitation is tied to the specific mechanism of abusing the Linux kernel pipe. For other vulnerabilities that lack this capability, achieving similar security implications remains challenging. In this presentation, we introduce a novel exploitation method that extends the capabilities of Dirty Pipe to a broader range of vulnerabilities.

**Key Features of the New Exploitation Method:**

1. **Generalizability:** Our method can be applied to any vulnerability with a double-free ability, enabling it to demonstrate Dirty Pipe-like capabilities.
2. **Versatility:** While it retains the ability to bypass all kernel protections, our method also demonstrates the ability to escape containers, which Dirty Pipe cannot do.
3. **Universality:** Exploits using our method will work on any version of the affected kernel without modification, making it a universal solution for different kernel versions and architectures.

**Demonstration:**

- **Privilege Escalation on Linux and Android:** We will showcase how our method can be used to escalate privileges on both Linux and Android systems.
- **Container Escape on CentOS:** We will demonstrate how our method can be used to escape from a container on CentOS.

**Contribution:**

To the best of our knowledge, our exploitation method is the first general approach that enables the development of a universal exploit across different kernel versions and architectures. This not only simplifies the process of migrating exploits but also poses a significant challenge to existing kernel defense mechanisms.

**Release:**

We will release the detailed exploitation techniques and all the exploits demonstrated in this talk, providing the community with valuable insights and tools for further research and defense.

This new method represents a significant advancement in the field of kernel exploitation, offering both greater flexibility and increased power compared to the original Dirty Pipe vulnerability.
