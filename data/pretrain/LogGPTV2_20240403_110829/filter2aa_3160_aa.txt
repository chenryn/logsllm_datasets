 GPS (Global Positioning 
System)
 GPS Spoofing on the cheap
 Let’s change the time! 
 So what?
 Attacking NTP Servers
 How we can detect spoofing

Tells us where 
we are
Tells us the time

Anyone in the room not currently trust GPS 
locations?
Anyone in the room not currently trust GPS 
time?
Anyone feel that this will change by the end of 
the talk?
We Trust GPS Right? Right?????

@nzkarit
GPS too important to life? 
GPS must be great and robust? Right?
Important services rely on it:
Uber
Tinder
You have to trust it right?

NTP Time Source
Plane Location
Ship Location

Taxi law in NZ no longer knowledge 
requirement
And some other things as well

Now we are talking

@nzkarit
 A box
 An SDR with TX
 I used a BladeRF
 HackRF
 USRP
 So less US$500 in hardware
 Also some aluminium foil to make a Faraday Cage
 So it is now party trick simple and cheap
 This is the big game changer from the past
What we need
16

@nzkarit
Setup
17
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
Make sure you 
measure signal 
outside to ensure 
none is leaking
Be careful
@amm0nra patented Faraday Cage
18
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
INAL (I’m not a lawyer)
GPS isn’t Open Spectrum
So Faraday Cage
Keep all the juicy GPS goodness to 
yourself
The Law

@nzkarit
 Your SDR kit is going to be closer to the device
 So much stronger signal
 Got to have line of sight though
 GPS Orbits ~20,000 km
 So signals weak
 Signal is weaker than the noise floor
Remember

Noise Floor

@nzkarit
Got some simulator software and a 
bladeRF what could people get up to?
Right so what can we do?

@nzkarit
 Two methods, first one two steps
 1. Generate the data for broadcast
 About 1GB per minute
 Static location or a series of locations to make a path
 Has an Almanac file which has satellite locations
 Uses Almanac to select what satellites are required for 
that location at that time
 2. Broadcast the data
How does the tool work?
24
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
Generate in real time
Need a fast enough computer
1. Generate and broadcast
How does the tool work?
25
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
 By default only 5 mins of transmit data
 Need to change a value in code for longer
 Approx. 1GB a minute hence the limit
 Pi3 about three times slower than real time, so must be 
precomputed
 Pi3 there is a file size limit
 5min NTPd
shutdown
No log messages as to why
When starting NTP you get “Time has been 
changed”
And NTP will accept the GPS even if it differs 
greatly from the local clock
NTP

With debugging enabled

manually within 1000 s.

If we turn the logging up
36
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
If NTPd crashes but starts via watchdog 
or a manual restart
Will people look deeper?
Will people check the time is correct?
Would a Sys Admin notice?
37
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
We can’t do big jumps in time
We will have to change time in steps
So how can we move time?
38
www.zxsecurity.co.nz
@nzkarit
 Python Script
 Wraps the real time version of the GPS Simulator
 Moves time back in steps
 So as not to crash NTPd

Do you want to disallow multiple 
uses of the same authentication 
token? This restricts you to one 
login about every 30s, but it 
increases your chances to notice 
or even prevent man-in-the-middle 
attacks (y/n)

Make sure there is a setting related to 
reuse
Make sure it is set to not allow reuse
What to look for in a TOTP

@nzkarit
 HOTP - HMAC-based one-time 
password
 Also in Google Auth
 U2F
 One token can be used on many sites
 One user can subscribe more than one 
token
 Friends don’t let friends SMS
Also other 2FA solutions

@nzkarit
SUDO counts time in a different way, using 
OS Clock Ticks
so you can’t roll back time and bypass sudo
password check timeout
sudoer file timestamp_timeout=X
Uptime works in a similar way
