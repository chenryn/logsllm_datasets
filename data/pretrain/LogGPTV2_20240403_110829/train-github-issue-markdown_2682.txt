AFAIK, it would be great if two types of interfaces are defined, which would
help developers to do better source reusing. And also that there maybe other
things in same situation, I hope somebody else can commit them here too.
At first, for the request builders, there are SearchRequestBuilder,
CountRequestBuilder and DeleteByQueryRequestBuilder which are sharing a group
of methods with same name due to the completely same functions. Thus,
currently, I have to define 3 methods for the separated 3 types if I want to
add some common search define on the request(especially for adding routing by
common logic).
Secondly, for the QueryBuilders and FilterBuilders, they are in 99% similarity
logically and they are in 99% similarity in the real source but there are only
separated interfaces for each other of query and filter. Hence, I have to
define 2 methods for the separated 2 types if I want to create a common query
define for some common business data structure.
I believe both of the above situations can be addressed by defining higher
level interfaces.
