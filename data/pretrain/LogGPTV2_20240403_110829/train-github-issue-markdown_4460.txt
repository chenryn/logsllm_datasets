Subject: Follow-Up on Recent Issue

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to clarify a recent issue. It appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the addition of 3 to each value, as it was indeed added. I may have sent this message twice, but upon rechecking, it did not appear in the list, and I did not receive an email confirmation. My apologies if this follow-up seems redundant.

Please let me know if further clarification is needed.

Best regards,  
Theo
