    interface OverloadedMethod {
        (a:string): Object;
        (a:number): void;
    }
    const bar : string|number = 0;
    const foo : OverloadedMethod = null;
    foo(bar) // red squiggles here under bar: Argument of type 'string | number' is not assignable to 'string'. Type 'string | number' is not assignable to 'number'
This is a minimal example of where typescript complains that `bar` cannot
unify with any of the individual methods on `foo`, even though it could
reasonable deduce that since there's only one implementation of said method,
that `(a:string|number) : Object|void` is a perfectly cromulent alternative.
Looks like this is a consequence of #5766 and it rears it head when dealing w/
Express routing's d.ts.
