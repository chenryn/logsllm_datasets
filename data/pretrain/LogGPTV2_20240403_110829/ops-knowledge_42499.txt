User: I have Python application and virtualenv for it. I run it on Debian virtual machine. Is it possible to configure IntelliJ to start application and use IntelliJ debug tools? The problem is how to use virtualenv for debian in Windows 7 system.
Assistant: Just install an appropriate python and virtualenv for that python directly on the windows 7 machine.
