User: I have two background processes running on linux machine. One is Java and second one is in Python. What would be most efficient way to exchange data between these two apps ? I am talking about text / images data below < 10Mb approx each 5 minutes (not streamed). Due high cost of refactoring we cannot migrate fully to Python (or Java).
Natural choice is filesystem or local networking but what about in memory database (sqllite/redis/...) ? Filesystem handling or network handling is sometimes painfull i guess.
Do you think that in-memory-DB would be good option for such task ? Jython is not option there as not all Python libraries are compatible...
Environment : ubuntu server 12.04 64bit, Python 2.7, Java 7
Assistant: Given the relatively low volume of data you need, I would say the easiest way would be to use a TCP socket to communicate between the two processes. The data speed on the loopback interface is more than enough for your needs.
