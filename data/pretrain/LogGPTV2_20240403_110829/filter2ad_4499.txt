## Panel Theme
Wireless network components, such as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Bluetooth radios, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), offer unprecedented convenience and potential productivity gains. However, they also present significant security risks. Misunderstandings about their capabilities, overestimation of their security features, and the lack of robust policies can lead to substantial risks in the workplace. Often, decisions are made based on superficial information, leading to the adoption of technologies that have not been thoroughly tested or are incompatible with existing or future system architectures.

Customers are frequently pressured by upper management to integrate new system components or technologies without adequate security analysis or even a basic understanding of the devices. This can create vulnerabilities, backdoors, and entry points into otherwise secure networks.

## Panelist Contributions

### Anna Entrichel
Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Wireless LANs (WLANs) present numerous potential problems beyond the inherent risk of data loss due to the broadcast nature of the network radio card. Over the past two years, we have been examining the potential vulnerabilities in WLANs that could result in information loss. These include encryption weaknesses, MAC controls, network access, jamming, and inter-brand interoperability. While some of these issues have solutions, others require specific precautions. It is crucial for system administrators to be aware of these vulnerabilities before purchasing and setting up a wireless network.

### James Bergman
For customers requiring SECRET-level protection for their mobile data, ensuring the security of the WLAN is paramount. Proper encryption using the correct algorithms can provide significant protection against traffic analysis, spoofing, unauthorized network access, and confidentiality breaches. Implementing encryption at the network level offers a flexible and secure foundation, and incorporating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can ensure end-to-end data protection, even across wired-to-wireless network connections.

### Jason Willis
Policies that protect systems from external threats are only part of the solution. The introduction of small, handheld devices like PDAs (e.g., PalmPilots, Blackberries, and other personal electronic devices) presents a much larger threat than previous concerns such as cellular phones and removable media. These devices combine the capabilities of both, posing a significant risk of data loss from both internal and external attackers. Companies are often forced to either ban or ignore these devices. COTS systems that can transmit over short and long distances, interface with systems both physically and remotely, and bypass standard protection measures, introduce a myriad of vulnerabilities. Several policy statements will be highlighted and explained to address these (still) potential risks.

### Herb Little
Research In Motion (RIM) has been the leading provider of secure, always-connected communications for users on the go. Providing additional security for customers who find even FIPS 140-1 Level 1 certification insufficient is a significant challenge for commercial providers. Additional layers of protection, assets, and unique architectural requirements can cause minor modifications to COTS equipment to have far-reaching effects on the entire product line. Balancing the expectations of the security and marketing departments, while meeting current and future customer needs, is extremely difficult. RIM has collaborated with the government to adjust design criteria and processes to meet these goals and has begun to learn about system security. Their lessons learned and their plans for the commercial market will be discussed.
