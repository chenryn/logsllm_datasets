Panel Theme 
Wireless  Network  Components  (Wireless  Local  Area 
Networks,  Bluetooth  Radios,    and    Personal  Digital 
Assistants)  are  presenting  unparalleled  convenience, 
potential  gains  in  productivity,  and  huge  security  risks.  
Misunderstanding  of  capabilities,  overstatement  of 
security  properties,  and  a  fundamental  lack  of  valid 
policies, can make for a very large risk in the workplace.  
Too  often,  “Management  by  Inflight  Magazine”  has  led 
customers  to  embrace  technologies  that  are  not  properly 
tested  or  even  compatible  with  current  or  future  system 
architectures or policies.

system  components  or 
technologies without benefit of a lot of security analysis 
or  even  the  knowledge  of  the  devices  prior  to  their 
introduction  to  the  network.    Built  in  capabilities  of 
network  components  such  as  Bluetooth  radios,  and 
wireless LANs will be seen as not only improvements in 
communications,  but  potential  holes,  backdoors,  and 
points of entry to otherwise secure networks. 
Panelists and Their Issues

There  are  many  potential  problems  with  Commercial 
Off  the  Shelf  Wireless  LANs  above  and  beyond  the 
inherent loss of information due to the broadcast nature of 
the network radio card.  We have been working for nearly 
2 years to examine the potential vulnerabilities in WLANs 
that  may  result  in  a  loss  of  information.    Encryption 
weaknesses,  MAC  controls,  network  access,  jamming, 
and  inter-brand  interoperability  have  all  been  seen  as 
weaknesses  in  this  technology.    Some  of  the  areas  have 
fixes, and some simply have precautions, but each should 
be  known  by  the  system  administrator  prior  to  purchase 
and set-up of a wireless network.

there  are  customers 
that 
absolutely  require  SECRET  level  protection  for  their 
mobile data, what can be done to ensure that the WLAN 
is protected.  Encryption, using the proper algorithms, can 
give the WLAN a great deal of protection against traffic 
analysis,  spoofing, 
indiscrete  network  access,  and 
confidentiality weaknesses.  Incorporation at the network 
level  gives  the  system  a  flexible  and  secure  basis  of 
protection  for  the  WLAN  user  and  the  incorporation  of 
PKI  can  give  end-to-end  protection  of  data,  even  over 
wired-to-wireless network connections.

Policies that protect systems from external threats are 
only  part  of  the  answer.    The  introduction  of  potential 
vulnerabilities that can be introduced by small, handheld 
devices  (e.g.,  PDAs  like  PalmPilots,  Blackberries,  and 
other  Personal  Electronic  Devices)  are  much  larger  than 
the  previous  threats  of  cellular  phones  and  removable 
media,  because  they  combine  the  capabilities  of  both.  
The  use  of  these  devices,  even  in  unclassified  areas, 
present such a potential loss of data, from both inside and 
outside  attackers,  that  companies  are  being  forced  to 
either ban or ignore them.  COTS systems that have the 
capability  to  transmit  both  short  and  long  distances, 
interface with systems both physically and remotely, and 
even  in  spite  of  standard  protection  measures,  present  a 
plethora of vulnerabilities.  Exploration of several policy

Providing additional security for a customer set that finds 
even FIPS 140-1 level 1 certification too low can be a real 
challenge for a commercial provider.  Additional layers of 
protection,  additional  assets,  and  unique  architecture 
requirements  can  make  even  minor  modifications  to 
COTS equipment send ripples through the entire product 
line.  Balancing the security and marketing departments’ 
expectations, and meeting the needs of the customer today 
and  tomorrow  can  be  very  difficult.    RIM  has  worked 
with  the  Government  to  change  design  criteria  and 
process to meet these goals, and has begun their learning
