 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
With the MySQL dialect it is currently possible to specify a collation for a
VARCHAR column (as well as for TEXT and CHAR columns??).
AFAIK that's not possible with the PostgreSQL dialect. That would be a nice
feature to have, as the locale setting is set (in stone) when a Postgres
database is created...
I've just seen that someone requested the same feature for the SQLite dialect
(bug #2276).  
So maybe that collation feature could be implemented in a more generic way
inside SQLAlchemy?
Thanks a lot!
