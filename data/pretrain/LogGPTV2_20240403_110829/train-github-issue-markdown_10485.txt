I am working with 4/5/6D arrays and I have found so many bugs caused by
supplying 4 indexes to a 5D array, which just silently returns an (essentially
random) element.
I think this should be considered a bug as it is very easy to do by mistake
and leads to data corruption.
Is this regarded as a feature? What is the reasoning behind it, rather than
requiring colons to fill out the missing indexes?
