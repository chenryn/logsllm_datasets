User: If I use the Twisted Endpoint API to make a series of connections to the same host, will Twisted cache the DNS lookup between requests?
If it does, will it honour the DNS record's TTL?
My implementation is fairly vanilla. I instantiate a SSL4ClientEndpoint with host, port etc, and through the life of the program I use it to make several connections.
Assistant: I think Twisted simply uses the OS' resolver, so the answer to both questions is "as much as your OS does".
