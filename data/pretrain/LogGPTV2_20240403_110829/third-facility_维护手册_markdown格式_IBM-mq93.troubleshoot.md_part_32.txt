### Display Channel Status Details

**Command:**
```
1 : display chs(*)
AMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.
```

**Channel Information:**
- **CHANNEL:** DEMO.QM2
- **XMITQ:** SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE
- **CONNAME:** computer.ibm.com(1414)
- **CURRENT CHLTYPE:** CLUSSDR
- **STATUS:** RETRYING

**Possible Causes:**
1. The remote queue manager is not available.
2. An incorrect parameter is defined for the local manual cluster-sender channel or the remote cluster-receiver channel.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Remote Queue Manager Availability:**
   - Are there any error messages?
   - Is the queue manager active?
   - Is the listener running?
   - Is the cluster-sender channel able to start?

2. **Verify Channel Definition:**
   - If the remote queue manager is available, check if there is a problem with the channel definition.
   - Use the following command to check the definition type of the cluster queue manager:
     ```
     1 : dis clusqmgr(*) deftype where(channel eq DEMO.QM2)
     AMQ8441: Display Cluster Queue Manager details.
     ```

**Example Output:**
- **CLUSQMGR:** QM2
- **CHANNEL:** DEMO.QM2
- **CLUSTER:** DEMO
- **DEFTYPE:** CLUSSDRA

**Action Based on DEFTYPE:**
- **If DEFTYPE is CLUSSDR:**
  - The channel is using the local manual cluster-sender definition.
  - Alter any incorrect parameters in the local manual cluster-sender definition and restart the channel.

- **If DEFTYPE is CLUSSDRA or CLUSSDRB:**
  - The channel is using an auto-defined cluster-sender channel.
  - The auto-defined cluster-sender channel is based on the definition of a remote cluster receiver channel.
  - Alter any incorrect parameters in the remote cluster receiver definition. For example, the `conname` parameter might be incorrect:
    ```
    1 : alter chl(demo.qm2) chltype(clusrcvr) conname('newhost(1414)')
    AMQ8016: IBM MQ channel changed.
    ```

**Propagation of Changes:**
- Changes to the remote cluster-receiver definition are propagated to interested cluster queue managers.
- Verify that the updates have been propagated correctly by checking the `conname` parameter:
  ```
  1 : dis clusqmgr(qm2) conname
  AMQ8441: Display Cluster Queue Manager details.
  CLUSQMGR(QM2) CHANNEL(DEMO.QM2) CLUSTER(DEMO) CONNAME(newhost(1414))
  ```

- If the auto-defined definition is now correct, restart the channel.

### DISPLAY CLUSQMGR Shows CLUSQMGR Names Starting with SYSTEM.TEMP

**Symptom:**
- The queue manager has not received any information from the full repository queue manager that the manually defined CLUSSDR channel points to.

**Cause:**
- The manually defined CLUSSDR channel must be in the running state.

**Solution:**
1. **Check CLUSRCVR Definition:**
   - Ensure the `conname` and `cluster` parameters are correct.
   - Alter the channel definition if it is incorrect.

2. **Set Correct Authority:**
   - Issue the following command to set the correct authority for the `SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE`:
     ```
     setmqaut -m <queue_manager> -n SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE -t q -g mqm +all
     ```

3. **Wait for Restart:**
   - It might take some time for the remote queue managers to attempt a new restart and start their channels with the corrected definition.

### Return Code 2035 (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED)

**Symptom:**
- Applications receive a return code of 2035 (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) when trying to open a queue in a cluster.

**Cause:**
- The application is not authorized to put to the cluster transmission queue.

**Solution:**
- The solution depends on the platform:
  - **z/OS:** Use your security manager.
  - **Other Platforms:** Create a local alias to the cluster queue, or authorize all users to have access to the transmission queue.

### Return Code 2085 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME)

**Symptom:**
- Applications receive a return code of 2085 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME) when trying to open a queue in the cluster.

**Cause:**
- The queue manager where the object exists or this queue manager might not have successfully entered the cluster.

**Solution:**
1. **Ensure Full Repositories are Accessible:**
   - Make sure that they can each display all the full repositories in the cluster.
   - Ensure that the CLUSSDR channels to the full repositories are trying to start.

2. **Check Open Options:**
   - If the queue is in the cluster, ensure that appropriate open options are used. You cannot get messages from a remote cluster queue, so make sure the open options are for output only.

### Return Code 2189 (MQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR)

**Symptom:**
- Applications receive a return code of 2189 (MQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR) when trying to open a queue in the cluster.

**Cause:**
- The queue is being opened for the first time, and the queue manager cannot contact any full repositories.

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the CLUSSDR channels to the full repositories are not continually trying to start.

### Return Code 2082 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_ALIAS_BASE_Q)

**Symptom:**
- Applications get rc=2082 (MQRC_UNKNOWN_ALIAS_BASE_Q) when trying to open a queue in the cluster.

**Problem:**
- An MQOPEN or MQPUT1 call was issued specifying an alias queue as the target, but the BaseQName in the alias queue attributes is not recognized as a queue name.

**Solution:**
1. **Leave ObjectQmgrName Blank:**
   - Leave the `ObjectQmgrName` parameter blank so that the clustering decides which queue manager to route to.
   
2. **Check Open Options:**
   - If the queue is in the cluster, ensure that appropriate open options are used. You cannot get messages from a remote cluster queue, so make sure the open options are for output only.

### Messages Not Arriving on Destination Queues

**Symptom:**
- Messages are not arriving on the destination queues.

**Cause:**
- The messages might be stuck at their origin queue manager.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify Transmission Queue and Channel Status:**
   - Use the following command to identify the transmission queue and the status of the channel:
     ```
     1 : dis clusqmgr(QM1) CHANNEL(*) STATUS DEFTYPE QMTYPE XMITQ
     AMQ8441: Display Cluster Queue Manager details.
     ```

2. **Ensure Transmission Queue is Empty:**
   - Check that the cluster transmission queue is empty:
     ```
     1 : display ql(SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.DEMO.QM1) curdepth
     AMQ8409: Display Queue details.
     ```

### Messages Put to Cluster Alias Queue Go to SYSTEM.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE

**Symptom:**
- Messages put to an alias queue go to `SYSTEM.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE` with reason `MQRC_UNKNOWN_ALIAS_BASE_Q`.

**Cause:**
- A message is routed to a queue manager where a clustered alias queue is defined, but a local target queue is not defined on that queue manager.

**Solution:**
1. **Change Alias Queue Definitions:**
   - Change all alias queue definitions to specify `DEFBIND (NOTFIXED)`.

2. **Use MQOO_BIND_NOT_FIXED:**
   - Use `MQOO_BIND_NOT_FIXED` as an open option when the queue is opened.

3. **Ensure Local Queue Definition:**
   - If you specify `MQOO_BIND_ON_OPEN`, ensure that a cluster alias resolves to a local queue defined on the same queue manager as the alias.

### Outdated Information in the Cluster

**Symptom:**
- `DISPLAY QCLUSTER` and `DISPLAY CLUSQMGR` show objects which are out of date.

**Cause:**
- Updates to the cluster only flow between the full repositories over manually defined CLUSSDR channels.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that the queue manager where the object exists and the local queue manager are still connected to the cluster.
   - Check that each queue manager can display all the full repositories in the cluster.

2. **Check CLUSSDR Channels:**
   - Ensure that the CLUSSDR channels to the full repositories are not continually trying to restart.
   - Ensure that the full repositories have enough CLUSSDR channels defined to correctly connect them together.

### No Changes in the Cluster Reflected in the Local Queue Manager

**Symptom:**
- No changes in the cluster are being reflected in the local queue manager.

**Cause:**
- The repository manager process is not processing repository commands.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Command Queue:**
   - Ensure that the `SYSTEM.CLUSTER.COMMAND.QUEUE` is empty:
     ```
     1 : display ql(SYSTEM.CLUSTER.COMMAND.QUEUE) curdepth
     AMQ8409: Display Queue details.
     ```

2. **Check Channel Initiator:**
   - Ensure that the channel initiator is running on z/OS.

3. **Check Error Logs:**
   - Check for any error messages in the error logs indicating a temporary resource shortage.

### DISPLAY CLUSQMGR Displays a Queue Manager Twice

**Symptom:**
- `DISPLAY CLUSQMGR` displays a queue manager twice.

**Cause:**
- The queue manager might have been deleted and then re-created and redefined, or it might have been cold-started on z/OS without following the procedure to remove a queue manager from a cluster.

**Solution:**
- Use the `RESET CLUSTER` command to remove all traces of the old instance of the queue manager:
  ```
  2 : reset cluster(DEMO) qmid('QM1_2002-03-04_11.04.19') action(FORCEREMOVE) queues(yes)
  AMQ8559: RESET CLUSTER accepted.
  ```
