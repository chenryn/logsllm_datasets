## MITRE ATT&CK 技术
下表是使用 MITRE ATT&CK 框架的第9版构建的。
策略 | ID | 名称 | 技术  
---|---|---|---  
Execution | T1106 | ative API | ESPecter leverages several Windows APIs:
VirtualAlloc , WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread for process
injection.  
Persistence | T1542.003 | Pre-OS Boot: Bootkit | ESPecter achieves persistence
by compromising Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi) located on the ESP, or by
modifying the MBR on Legacy Boot systems.

null.sys or beep.sys driver with its own malicious one in order to be executed
on system startup.  
Defense Evasion | T1055.001 | Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library
Injection | ESPecter’s driver injects its main user-mode components into
svchost.exe and winlogon.exe processes.  
| T1564.001 | Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories | ESPecter’s
Client.dll component creates hidden directories to store collected data.  
| T1564.005 | Hide Artifacts: Hidden File System | ESPecter bootkit installers
for Legacy Boot versions use unallocated disk space located right after the
MBR to store its code, configuration and malicious driver.  
| T1140 | Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information | ESPecter uses single-byte
XOR with subtraction to decrypt user-mode payloads.  
| T1562 | Impair Defenses | ESPecter patches Windows kernel function directly
in memory to disable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE).  
| T1036.003 | Masquerading: Rename System Utilities | ESPecter bootkit
installers for Legacy Boot versions copy cmd.exe to con1866.exe to evade
detection.  
| T1112 | Modify Registry | ESPecter can use DefaultConfig value under
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control to store configuration.  
| T1601.001 | Modify System Image: Patch System Image | ESPecter patches
various functions in Windows Boot Manager, Windows OS loader and OS kernel
directly in memory during the boot process.  
| T1027.002 | Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing | ESPecter’s
WinSys.dll component is packed using the MPRESS packer.  
| T1542.003 | Pre-OS Boot: Bootkit | ESPecter achieves persistence by
modifying Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi) located on the ESP or by
modifying the MBR on Legacy Boot systems.  
| T1553.006 | Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing Policy Modification |
ESPecter patches Windows kernel function SepInitializeCodeIntegrity directly
in memory to disable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE).  
| T1497.003 | Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion | ESPecter’s
WinSys.dll component can be configured to postpone C&C communication after
execution or to communicate with the C&C only in a specified time range.  
Credential Access | T1056.001 | Input Capture: Keylogging | ESPecter has a
keylogging capability.  
Discovery | T1010 | Application Window Discovery | ESPecter’s Client.dll
component reports foreground window names along with keylogger information to
provide application context.  
| T1083 | File and Directory Discovery | ESPecter’s Client.dll component can
list file information for specific directories.  
| T1120 | Peripheral Device Discovery | ESPecter’s Client.dll component
detects the insertion of new devices by listening for the WM_DEVICECHANGE
window message.  
| T1057 | Process Discovery | ESPecter’s Client.dll component can list running
processes and their loaded modules.  
| T1012 | Query Registry | ESPecter’s WinSys.dll component can check for
installed software under the Registry key
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.  
| T1082 | System Information Discovery | ESPecter user-mode payloads can
collect system information from the victim’s machine.  
| T1124 | System Time Discovery | ESPecter’s WinSys.dll component can use
GetLocalTime for time discovery.  
Collection | T1119 | Automated Collection | ESPecter’s Client.dll component
can automatically collect screenshots, intercepted keystrokes and various
files.  
| T1025 | Data from Removable Media | ESPecter’s Client.dll component can
collect files with specified extension from removable drives.  
| T1074.001 | Data Staged: Local Data Staging | ESPecter’s Client.dll
component stores automatically collected data into a hidden local directory.  
| T1056.001 | Input Capture: Keylogging | ESPecter has keylogging
functionality.  
| T1113 | Screen Capture | ESPecter’s Client.dll component has screen capture
functionality.  
Command and Control | T1071.001 | Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols |
ESPecter’s WinSys.dll component communicates with its C&C server over HTTPS.  
| T1573.001 | Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography | ESPecter’s
Client.dll component encrypts C&C traffic using single-byte XOR.  
| T1105 | Ingress Tool Transfer | ESPecter’s user-mode components can download
additional payloads from C&C.  
| T1104 | Multi-Stage Channels | ESPecter’s user-mode components use separate
C&C channels.  
| T1095 | Non-Application Layer Protocol | ESPecter’s Client.dll component
uses TCP for C&C communication.  
Exfiltration | T1020 | Automated Exfiltration | ESPecter’s Client.dll
component creates a thread to automatically upload collected data to the C&C.  
| T1041 | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel | ESPecter exfiltrates data over the
same channel used for C&C.  
| T1029 | Scheduled Transfer | ESPecter’s Client.dll component is set to
upload collected data to the C&C every five seconds.
