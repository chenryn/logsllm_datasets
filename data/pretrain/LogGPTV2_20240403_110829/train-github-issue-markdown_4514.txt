Hi all.
I've asked this question here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35274885/can-you-have-a-stand-alone-
directive-in-angular-2
It came down to using within a component, but it's throwing an error:
> The component Slider has 1 elements, but only 0 slots were provided.
Slider.ts
    import {Component, View, ElementRef} from 'angular2/core';
    @Component({
        selector: 'Slider',
        template: ''
    })
    export class Slider {
        constructor(private element: ElementRef) {
            console.log('Slider');
        }
    }
index.html  
`hello world`
Is this a bug with the system or am I writing this out wrong? The code itself
within the index HTML disappears from the DOM at run time.
Here is a plnkr: https://plnkr.co/UH42bVv93Fedrre7GKFI Hopefully that works
for you
