# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I used to use Hain to do /shutdown or /restart, this is a feature I
surprisingly used allot!  
My PC screen would be off and I would be able to do ALT+SPACE /restart or
/shutdown without having to turn on my screen.  
I would also use /taskkill /f /t /pid [Process name] allot. Later on I started
using a plugin allowing me to /kill [Process name] instead.
This would make opening CMD for a single thing redundant. It would make some
peoples workflow allot quicker
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Either a direct push to CMD/Powershell using /[command], /p[command] or
additionally allow custom commands to be set as shortcuts for these.
