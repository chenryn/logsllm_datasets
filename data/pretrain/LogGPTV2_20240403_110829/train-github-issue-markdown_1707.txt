The error message you're encountering, `Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use 'import.meta' outside a module`, indicates that the `import.meta` syntax is being used in a context where it is not supported. This typically happens when the code is not being treated as an ES6 module.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that your code is being treated as a module. If you are using a bundler or a transpiler (such as Babel), you can configure it to handle `import.meta` and other ES6 module features. Hereâ€™s how you can address this:

1. **Ensure Your File is Treated as a Module:**
   - If you are using a bundler like Webpack, make sure your file has the `.mjs` extension or is explicitly marked as a module in your configuration.
   - If you are using a JavaScript runtime, ensure that the file is loaded with the `type="module"` attribute in your HTML or that the file is imported using `import` statements.

2. **Transpile Your Code:**
   - Use a transpiler like Babel to convert your modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with older environments.
   - Install Babel and the necessary plugins:
     ```sh
     npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
     ```
   - Create a Babel configuration file (e.g., `.babelrc`):
     ```json
     {
       "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
     }
     ```
   - Transpile your code:
     ```sh
     npx babel src --out-dir dist
     ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that `import.meta` and other modern JavaScript features are properly handled and your code runs without errors.
