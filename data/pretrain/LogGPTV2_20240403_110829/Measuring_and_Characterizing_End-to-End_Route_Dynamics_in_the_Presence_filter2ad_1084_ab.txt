### Load Balancer and Route Measurement

A load balancer can have one interface in a multi-interface hop, or it may not be related to load balancing at all. After constructing the database of load balancers, FastMapping performs periodic measurement rounds. Each round consists of two main steps:

1. **Fast Route Measurements:**
   - FastMapping periodically probes all monitored virtual paths to detect route changes.
   - To minimize probing overhead, MDA (Multipath Detection Algorithm) is disabled, and Paris traceroute is modified to send a single probe per hop until it reaches the destination.
   - Probes are sent with TTL (Time to Live) values up to 30, spaced by 50ms, and the process stops as soon as an answer is received from the destination.
   - This spacing reduces the probing time and the likelihood that a failure or route change will occur while Paris traceroute traces the route.
   - To minimize unresponsive hops, timed-out probes are retransmitted up to three times.

2. **Update Load Balancer Database:**
   - FastMapping uses the load balancer database to verify if each observed interface was previously seen in past measurements with MDA.
   - If a new interface is detected, FastMapping uses MDA to remap the route and update the load balancer database.
   - The database is periodically updated by removing entries older than 24 hours.

This probing strategy ensures that all probes in a virtual path follow the same route unless a route change occurs. The load balancer database helps identify cases of per-packet load balancing, which are disregarded when computing route changes. Any new interface seen during fast route measurements—due to routing changes, new load balancers, or internal changes—triggers an MDA execution, allowing FastMapping to differentiate between route changes and load balancing.

### Comparison with MDA

We compare the route dynamics observed with FastMapping to those observed by MDA using trace-driven simulations. Using D2 as a baseline, we compute what FastMapping would see. We find 10,013,958 route changes using complete load balancer information from MDA and 9,822,372 route changes using FastMapping, a difference of only 1.9%. This small difference is due to either MDA mapping errors or transient changes. For example, 40% of the missed changes occur in measurement rounds where a load balancer disappears for only one round. FastMapping misses these changes because undetected load balancers remain in its database, leading it to attribute the differences to load balancing rather than route changes. In practice, FastMapping probes faster than MDA, so it should detect more transient route changes, as confirmed in Section 5.

### Dataset Collection

We use FastMapping to collect a dataset, denoted D3, from 70 PlanetLab nodes over five weeks starting September 1st, 2010. The same destination list and ICMP probes as in D1 and D2 are used. Due to FastMapping's probing strategy, D3 has a much higher probing frequency, taking only 4.4 minutes on average to perform a measurement round. We remove 2.1% of route measurements from D3 that contain repeated interfaces. D3 traverses 7,842 ASes and 97% of the large ASes [10].

### Route Prevalence and Persistence

Using D2 and D3, we study Internet route dynamics and re-evaluate Paxson's previous results on route persistence and prevalence [11]. D2 probes 115 times more virtual paths than Paxson's original dataset, and D3 probes 66 times more virtual paths, with more frequent route measurements.

**Route Persistence:**
- Route persistence identifies how long a route remains stable before it changes.
- Paxson used a Poisson process for route measurements, enabling him to study route changes at small time scales and compute the probability of missing route changes.
- In our datasets, we use high-frequency periodic measurements to study persistence at finer time scales.
- We start by removing very unstable routes and estimate the probability of missing a route change in the remaining routes.
- We filter out virtual paths that change more frequently than once every 20 minutes, leaving routes with a low probability of changing between consecutive measurements (0.5%).

Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of route durations for every route in D2 and D3. Most routes are short-lived, indicating rapid route changes. Measuring virtual paths every 38 minutes is insufficient to accurately capture route dynamics, as D2 misses 36% of route changes lasting less than 38 minutes compared to D3.

**Route Prevalence:**
- We study the fraction of time a virtual path stays in its prevalent route, i.e., the most frequently realized route.
- Figure 6 shows the distribution of the fraction of time a virtual path uses its prevalent route in D3.
- Similar to Paxson, we find that 62% of virtual paths have a route that stays active for at least 60% of the time.
- We extend Paxson's results to study whether prevalent routes change over time and for how long they stay prevalent.
- Figure 6 also shows the distribution of the fraction of time a virtual path uses the prevalent route for different time windows, confirming that prevalent routes change over time.

### Related Work

**Topology Mapping:**
- Techniques such as Tracetree [6], DoubleTree [3], and dynamic destination selection [2] reduce redundant probes and increase topology mapping frequency but do not handle load balancers explicitly.
- Paris traceroute’s MDA identifies load balancing but with significant probing overhead [14].
- FastMapping achieves a balance between fast probing and daily updates of load balancers, making it suitable for large-scale topology mapping projects like CAIDA’s Skitter/Ark [5], DIMES [13], or iPlane [9].

**Characterization of Route Dynamics:**
- Few studies since 1997 have reported characteristics of route change locations [4,15], and there has been no reappraisal of Paxson’s work on end-to-end route dynamics.
- Schwartz et al. [12] use traceroutes collected by DIMES to study route persistence and prevalence but cannot differentiate route dynamics from load balancing.
- For BGP dynamics, see Li et al. [7] and references within.

### Conclusion

Studying end-to-end Internet route dynamics requires high probing frequency. FastMapping addresses this challenge by remapping load balancers when changes are detected and updating them daily. Our observations, compared to Paxson’s [11], show that despite the growth of the Internet and new traffic engineering practices, route persistence and prevalence have not changed significantly. FastMapping can also be used to decrease probing overhead while maintaining a constant probing frequency.
