### III. Summary Judgment on Blizzard’s Protective Software

There appears to be a factual dispute regarding the extent to which Blizzard’s protective software prevents the copying of software code to RAM. Additionally, the parties have not provided sufficient facts for the Court to determine whether these protective measures safeguard Blizzard’s rights in the non-literal elements of the game. Therefore, summary judgment on this claim will be denied.

### IV. Blizzard’s Tortious Interference with Contract Claim (Count I)

Blizzard alleges that MDY is liable for tortious interference with contract because MDY intentionally induces World of Warcraft (WoW) users to purchase and use Glider, thereby breaching the terms of the End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Use (TOU). To establish tortious interference, Blizzard must demonstrate:

1. A valid contractual relationship exists between Blizzard and its customers.
2. MDY is aware of this relationship.
3. MDY has intentionally and improperly interfered in the relationship, causing a breach or termination.
4. Blizzard has suffered damage as a result.

MDY does not dispute several key elements: the existence of a valid contract (the EULA and TOU), MDY’s knowledge of the contract, and that using Glider breaches the contract. No additional proof is required for these elements.

#### Intentional Interference

MDY has intentionally interfered with the contract. It actively promotes Glider despite knowing that its use breaches the TOU. For example, Donnelly, the founder of MDY, learned in September 2005 that Blizzard had banned Glider users from WoW. In response, he modified Glider to evade detection. Donnelly acknowledged in a November 2005 email that using Glider was a violation of the TOU. MDY’s website also explicitly states that using Glider is against the TOU. Thus, there is no doubt that MDY knows its promotion and sale of Glider results in the breach of Blizzard’s contracts with its customers.

#### Damage to Blizzard

MDY argues that Blizzard has no evidence of damage caused by its conduct. However, MDY does not dispute that Glider consumes more Blizzard resources than any other bot due to its sophisticated anti-detection features, requiring Blizzard to divert resources from game development to combat Glider. Additionally, Blizzard has received numerous complaints from WoW players about other players’ use of Glider. Furthermore, Blizzard has presented evidence that the use of Glider has led to a loss of subscription fees from WoW players. Therefore, MDY’s contention that Blizzard cannot show harm is without merit.

#### Improper Conduct

The final question is whether MDY’s actions are improper. Arizona courts use the seven factors outlined in Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767 to determine when a defendant’s conduct is improper. These factors include:

1. The nature of the defendant’s conduct.
2. The defendant’s motive.
3. The interests of the plaintiff with which the conduct interferes.
4. The interests sought to be advanced by the defendant.
5. The social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the defendant and the contractual interests of the plaintiff.
6. The proximity or remoteness of the defendant’s conduct to the interference.
7. The relationship between the parties.

**Nature of MDY’s Conduct:**
MDY knowingly aids WoW players in breaching their contracts with Blizzard, assists them in gaining an unfair advantage, and enables them to mine the game for financial gain in direct violation of the TOU. MDY also helps players avoid detection, placing Blizzard at risk. MDY’s own words indicate that it seeks to make it “bad business” for Blizzard to detect Glider, as counter-measures could ban or crash innocent customers.

**MDY’s Motive:**
MDY’s motive is clear: profit. Its business strategy is to exploit the pre-existing relationship between Blizzard and its customers for financial gain.

**Blizzard’s Interests:**
Blizzard has established valid and financially profitable contracts with its customers through the innovative development and marketing of WoW. These interests are legitimate and substantial, deserving of legal protection.

**MDY’s Interests:**
MDY asserts that it is an innovator deserving of protection. While Glider is innovative, its success depends on inducing Blizzard customers to breach their contracts. Glider affects the operation of WoW, allowing users to play in a way not intended or approved by Blizzard. MDY’s success is tied to WoW’s success, and it seeks to exploit this for financial gain. This factor favors a finding of impropriety.

**Social Interests:**
MDY argues that liability should not be imposed on one who honestly persuades another to alter a contractual relationship. However, this argument applies to competitors in a marketplace, not to a situation where MDY is exploiting existing contracts. MDY is not a competitor but an exploiter, and this factor favors a finding of impropriety.

**Proximity of Conduct:**
The link between MDY’s conduct and the contract breaches is direct. The development, marketing, and sale of Glider are the but-for cause of the breaches.

**Relationship Between the Parties:**
Blizzard and MDY are not competitors. Blizzard had pre-existing contractual relationships with WoW users, and MDY seeks to exploit these relationships for its commercial advantage.

All seven factors, including the most important first and second factors, favor a finding of improper conduct by MDY. The Court concludes that a reasonable jury applying these factors could not conclude that MDY has acted properly. Since the other requirements for tortious interference have been satisfied, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Blizzard with respect to MDY’s liability on this claim.

### V. Blizzard’s Unjust Enrichment Claim (Count VII)

MDY seeks summary judgment on Blizzard’s unjust enrichment claim. The essential elements of the claim are:

1. An enrichment of MDY.
2. An impoverishment of Blizzard.
3. A connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment.
4. The absence of justification for the enrichment and the impoverishment.
5. The absence of a legal remedy.

MDY does not address these elements but merely asserts that nothing it has done rises to the level of unjust enrichment. As the party seeking summary judgment, MDY has the initial burden of informing the Court of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. MDY has not met this burden. Moreover, MDY’s reply does not address the evidence and arguments presented by Blizzard. Therefore, the Court will deny MDY’s request for summary judgment.

### ORDER

IT IS ORDERED:

1. The parties’ motions for summary judgment (Dkt. ##39, 45) are granted in part and denied in part. The Court grants summary judgment in favor of Blizzard with respect to MDY’s liability for tortious interference (Count I) and contributory and vicarious copyright infringement (Counts II-III); grants summary judgment in favor of MDY on the portion of the DMCA claim (Count IV) that is based on 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2) and applies to Blizzard’s game client software code; grants summary judgment in favor of MDY on the unfair competition claim (Count VI); and denies summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim (Count VII).

2. The Court will set a final pretrial conference by separate order. Trial will concern the claims that remain unresolved – portions of the DMCA claim, the trademark claim, and the unjust enrichment claim – and damages or other remedies on Counts I, II, and III.

DATED this 14th day of July, 2008.
