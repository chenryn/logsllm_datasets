there appears to be a factual dispute with respect to the extent to which Blizzard’s protective
software protects against the copying of software code to RAM, and because the parties have
not submitted sufficient facts from which the Court can decide whether these protective
measures protect Blizzard’s rights in the non-literal elements of the game, summary judgment
on this claim will be denied.
IV.
Blizzard’s Tortious Interference with Contract Claim (Count I).
Blizzard alleges that MDY is liable for tortious interference with contract because
MDY intentionally induces WoW users to purchase and use Glider in breach of the terms of
the EULA and TOU.  Dkt. #10 ¶¶ 64-78.  To establish tortious interference, Blizzard must
show that (1) a valid contractual relationship exists between Blizzard and its customers,
(2) MDY knows of the relationship, (3) MDY has intentionally and improperly interfered in
the relationship and caused a breach or termination of the relationship, and (4) Blizzard has
been damaged as a result.  See Antwerp Diamond Exch. of Am., Inc. v. Better Bus. Bur. of
Maricopa County, Inc., 637 P.2d 733, 740 (Ariz. 1981); Wagonseller v. Scottsdale Mem’l
Hosp., 710 P.2d 1025, 1043 (Ariz. 1985), superseded in other respects by A.R.S. § 23-1501.
MDY does not dispute several elements of this tort:  that there is a valid contract
between Blizzard and its customers (the EULA and TOU), that MDY knows of the contract,
and that the use of Glider breaches the contract.  No additional proof is required on these
elements.
Nor is there a genuine dispute that MDY has intentionally interfered with the contract.
MDY actively promotes the use of Glider even though it knows that using Glider breaches
the TOU.  MDY has admitted as much.  Donnelly testified that he learned in September of
2005 that Blizzard had banned Glider users from playing WoW.  Dkt. #40-6 at 13, 17.  He
responded by modifying Glider so that it could not be detected by Blizzard.  Id.  Donnelly
expressly acknowledged in a November 2005 email that the use of Glider by his customers
was a breach of their contracts with Blizzard:  “[s]ince Blizzard does not want bots running
at all, it’s a violation to use them.”  Dkt. #43-10 at 3.  And MDY’s website openly
acknowledges that using Glider “is against the [TOU] as provided by Blizzard for [WoW].”

Dkt. #43-9 at 3.  In short, there can be no doubt that MDY knows that its promotion and sale
of Glider results in the breach of Blizzard’s contract with its customers.  MDY’s interference
clearly is intentional.
MDY contends that Blizzard has no evidence that MDY’s conduct has damaged
Blizzard.  Dkt. ##45 at 26-28, 57 at 28.  But MDY does not dispute that Glider consumes
more Blizzard resources than any other bot because of its sophisticated anti-detection features,
that Blizzard must divert resources from game development to combat Glider, and that
Blizzard has received numerous complaints from WoW players regarding other players’ use
of Glider.   Dkt. ##40 ¶¶ 220-23, 58 ¶¶ 101-03.  Moreover, Blizzard has presented evidence
that the use of Glider has caused Blizzard to lose subscription fees from WoW players.
Dkt. ##40 ¶¶ 254-57, 58 ¶ 124.  MDY’s contention that Blizzard can present no evidence of
harm is without merit.
The sole remaining question for purposes of liability is whether MDY’s actions are
improper.  Arizona has adopted the seven factors enumerated in Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 767 for determining when a defendant’s interfering conduct is improper.  See
Wagonseller, 710 P.2d at 1042-43.  Those factors include (1) the nature of the defendant’s
conduct, (2) the defendant’s motive, (3) the interests of the plaintiff with which the conduct
interferes, (4) the interests sought to be advanced by the defendant, (5) the social interests in
protecting the freedom of action of the defendant and the contractual interests of the plaintiff,
(6) the proximity or remoteness of the defendant’s conduct to the interference, and (7) the
relationship between the parties.  See id.  Courts give the greatest weight to the first two
factors.  Safeway Ins. Co. v. Guerrero, 106 P.3d 1020, 1027 (Ariz. 2005). 
The first factor concerns the nature of MDY’s conduct.  The following facts are not
disputed:  MDY knowingly aids WoW players in breaching their contracts with Blizzard;
MDY assists the players in gaining an advantage over other WoW players; MDY enables
players to mine the game for their own financial benefit and in direct violation of the TOU;
MDY assists players in avoiding detection by Blizzard, and does so in a way designed to place
Blizzard at risk.  In MDY’s own words, “[s]taying one step ahead of Blizzard is just about

impossible,” so MDY seeks to make it “bad business” for Blizzard to spend time and money
trying to detect Glider.  Dkt. #43-10 at 3.  MDY seeks to make it a “bad idea” for Blizzard to
try to detect Glider because counter-measures Blizzard must create to detect Glider present
the “risk [of] banning or crashing innocent customers.”  Id.
The second factor concerns MDY’s motive.  That motive is clear – profit.  MDY’s
business strategy is not to accept and honor the pre-existing contract between Blizzard and
its customers, but to take advantage of that relationship for MDY’s financial gain.   
The third factor considers the interests of Blizzard with which MDY interferes.  These
interests are both legitimate and substantial.  Blizzard has established valid and financially
profitable contracts with its customers, and has done so through the innovative development
and marketing of WoW.  Blizzard’s interests are fully deserving of the protection the law
affords legitimate contracts.
The fourth factor considers the interests sought to be advanced by MDY.  MDY asserts
that it too is an innovator deserving of protection.  Although MDY certainly has developed
an innovative and successful software program in Glider, and has done so on the strength of
Mr. Donnelly’s creative abilities and considerable computer skills, the success of MDY’s
endeavor depends on inducing Blizzard customers to breach their contracts.  Glider affects
the operation of WoW, empowering its users to play WoW in a way not contemplated or
approved by the game’s creator and copyright holder.  Glider is successful because WoW is
successful, and MDY seeks to exploit WoW’s success for its own financial benefit.  Thus,
even though MDY’s creative abilities cannot be denied, the fourth factor favors a finding of
impropriety.
The fifth factor concerns the social interests in protecting MDY’s freedom of action
and the contractual interests of Blizzard.  MDY argues that liability should not be imposed
on “‘one who honestly persuades another to alter a contractual relationship.’”  Dkt. #69 at 11.
But this language, quoted from the Wagonseller case, refers to competitors in a marketplace.
Wagonseller recognizes that businesses should be permitted to compete fairly for customers.

11 The Court rejects MDY’s argument under Restatement § 774 that the EULA and
TOU are against public policy because they are anti-competitive and restrain trade.  See
Dkt. #57 at 21-23.  Neither agreement prohibits MDY from developing and selling a
competing game.
12 Citing Bar J Bar Cattle Co. v. Pace, 763 P.2d 545 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1988), MDY
contends that “[m]alice must be the sole motivator for the actor to interfere tortiously.”
Dkt. ##45 at 22, 57 at 26 (emphasis in original).  The Court disagrees.  Bar J Bar simply
recognizes that the impropriety of a defendant’s conduct requires a multi-pronged inquiry.
Malice is one “facet[] of the element of impropriety that the plaintiff may show in a particular
case.”  Wagonseller, 710 P.2d at 1043 (emphasis added).  Malice need not be shown if the
other elements of improper conduct exist, and it certainly need not be the sole motivation.

legitimately seek to lure away the customers of another dealership.  MDY, however, is not a
competitor of Blizzard.  MDY does not offer a competing computer game.  Rather, MDY
persuades Blizzard customers to violate their contract with Blizzard for MDY’s financial
advantage.  Thus, although social interests favor full and honest competition, MDY ultimately
is an exploiter, not a competitor, and this fifth factor therefore favors a finding of impropriety.
See Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Platinum Worlds Travel, 769 F. Supp. 1203, 1206-07 (D. Utah 1990)
(finding the defendants’ conduct improper where their businesses depended on their ability
to induce the plaintiff’s customers to breach their contractual obligations while the plaintiff
continued to perform without knowledge of the breaches).11 
The sixth factor concerns the proximity of MDY’s conduct to the contract breaches.
Here, the link is direct.  The development, marketing, and sale of Glider is the but-for cause
of the breaches of contract.  “One who induces a third person not to perform his contract with
another interferes directly with the other’s contractual relation.  The interference is an
immediate consequence of the conduct[.]”  Restatement § 767 cmt. h. 
The seventh factor – the relationship between the parties – also weighs in favor of a
finding of impropriety.  Blizzard and MDY are not competitors.  Blizzard had pre-existing
contractual relationships with WoW users and MDY seeks to exploit that relationship to its
own commercial advantage.  See id. cmts. i, j.12

important first and second factors, favor a finding of improper conduct on the part of MDY.
The Court concludes that a reasonable jury applying these factors could not conclude that
MDY has acted properly.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  Because the other requirements for
tortious interference have been satisfied, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of
Blizzard with respect to MDY’s liability on this claim.
 V.
Blizzard’s Unjust Enrichment Claim (Count VII).
MDY seeks summary judgment on Blizzard’s unjust enrichment claim.  Dkt. #45 at
28. The essential elements of the claim are an enrichment of MDY, an impoverishment of
Blizzard, a connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment, the absence of
justification for the enrichment and the impoverishment, and the absence of a legal remedy.
See Cmty. Guardian Bank v. Hamlin, 898 P.2d 1005, 1008 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995).  MDY does
not address these elements, but merely asserts that nothing MDY has done rises to the level
of unjust enrichment.  Dkt. #45 at 28.
As the party seeking summary judgment, MDY has the initial burden of informing the
Court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate
the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  MDY has not
met this burden.  Moreover, MDY’s reply does not address the evidence and arguments
presented by Blizzard in support of this claim.  See Dkt. #54 at 24-25; Dkt. #69.  The Court
accordingly will deny MDY’s request for summary judgment.
IT IS ORDERED:
1.
The parties’ motions for summary judgment (Dkt. ##39, 45) are granted in part
and denied in part.  The Court grants summary judgment in favor of Blizzard with respect to
MDY’s liability for tortious interference (Count I) and contributory and vicarious copyright
infringement (Counts II-III); grants summary judgment in favor of MDY on the portion of the
DMCA claim (Count IV) that is based on 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2) and applies to Blizzard’s
game client software code; grants summary judgment in favor of MDY on the unfair
competition claim (Count VI); and denies summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim
(Count VII).
