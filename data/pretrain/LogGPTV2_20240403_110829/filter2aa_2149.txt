● What is UPnP(Universal Plug and Play) ?
● What is an IGD(Internet Gateway Device) ?
● How many IGD devices are on on-line ?
UPnP hacking timeline
 2001 – Ken from FTU – Three windows UPNP DoS attacks
 2001 – Eeye – Multiple remote BoF XP/ME/98

Main problems
- It uses the words “Plug and Play”
- No authentication
- Most stacks don't validate data
- Allowing indiscriminate WAN requests
- Some devices don't log UPnP requests

UPnP mapping cons
- UPnP stacks are buggy/unstable
- Limited bandwidth
- Protocols with heavy amounts of
  connections don't work well
- Some devices actually report having the port
   mapping functionality, but don't do anything

Mitigation
- Disabling UPnP actions from being executed on the WAN
- Operators using base configurations with UPnP disabled
- On some cases, disabling UPnP (things might break)
