### Superset Version
0.19.1

### Expected Results
I am attempting to use Mapbox with Superset. Initially, I used a PostgreSQL table, and Mapbox worked correctly. However, after saving my data to a Druid datasource, I encountered an error.

### Actual Results
```
TypeError: is not JSON serializable
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        raise TypeError(repr(o) + " is not JSON serializable")
    TypeError: is not JSON serializable
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add a datasource to Druid with the following schema:
   - `host` (String)
   - `lat` (Float)
   - `lng` (Float)
2. Use Superset with Mapbox to visualize the data.
