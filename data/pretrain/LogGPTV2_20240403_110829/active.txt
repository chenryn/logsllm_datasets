### Marking a Partition as Active on Basic Disks

**Description:**
On basic disks, the `active` command marks the currently selected partition as active. Only primary partitions can be marked as active. To perform this operation, you must first select a partition using the `select partition` command.

**Caution:**
- DiskPart only informs the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) that the selected partition is a valid system partition or system volume and is capable of containing the operating system startup files.
- DiskPart does not verify the contents of the partition. If you mistakenly mark a partition as active and it does not contain the necessary operating system startup files, your computer may fail to boot.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
active
```

**Examples:**
To mark the currently selected partition as the active partition, use the following command:
```plaintext
active
```

**Steps:**
1. Select the desired partition using the `select partition` command.
2. Use the `active` command to mark the selected partition as active.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the correct partition is marked as active, which is crucial for the proper booting of your operating system.
