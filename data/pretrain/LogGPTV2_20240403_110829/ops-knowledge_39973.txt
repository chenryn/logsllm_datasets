Question: A software development team is reviewing a function that uses variadic parameters to handle a variety of tasks with different argument types and counts. In a security assessment, which of the following would be a valid concern related to the function's design?
"A": "The function could be performing tasks that are not necessary, leading to performance degradation.",
"B": "The function's signature allows for a variadic number of parameters, making it difficult to ensure which function or method is being invoked.",
"C": "The function's implementation uses recursion to handle the variable number of arguments, making the code easier to maintain.",
"D": "The function's documentation is incomplete, lacking examples of how to invoke the function correctly."
Answer: B
