User: On a Linux server, how to find and list all files that have not been used for more than 50 days?
Assistant: You can use the find command combined with the mtime option to find and list all files that have not been used for more than 50 days. The specific command is as follows: ``` find /path/to/search -type f -mtime +50 -print ``` Explain the meaning of each part: - `find`: command name. - `/path/to/search`: Path to search. - `-type f`: The object type to search for is a file. - `-mtime +50`: Match files that were last modified 50 days ago. - `-print`: List the path of each matching file. This command will list all files that were last modified 50 days ago. If you want to delete these files, you can use `-delete` option. But before deleting the file, please be sure to confirm whether the file can be deleted.
