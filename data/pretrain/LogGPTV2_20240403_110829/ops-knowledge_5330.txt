To configure Remote Desktop Services on a Windows system, please follow these detailed steps:

1. **Open Control Panel and Access System Settings:**
   - Open the "Control Panel" from the Start menu.
   - Navigate to the "System and Security" section.

2. **Enable Remote Desktop:**
   - Within the "System and Security" page, locate and click on the "System" option.
   - On the left-hand side, select "Remote settings".
   - In the "System Properties" window that appears, under the "Remote" tab, check the box for "Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer". For enabling full remote control, also check "Allow remote connections to this computer".

3. **Specify Users (Optional):**
   - If you wish to restrict access to specific users or groups, click on "Select Users..." and add the desired accounts. This step is optional but recommended for enhanced security.

4. **Configure Advanced Options (Optional):**
   - Under the same "Remote" tab, you can click on "Advanced" to enable features such as Network Level Authentication (NLA). NLA adds an additional layer of security by requiring authentication before a session is established with the remote desktop.

5. **Adjust Firewall Settings (Optional):**
   - To ensure that your firewall allows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic, you may need to create an exception rule in Windows Firewall. You can do this via the "Windows Defender Firewall" control panel item, adding a new inbound rule for RDP (port 3389).

6. **Save Your Changes:**
   - After making all necessary adjustments, click "OK" to save the configuration changes.

7. **Set Up Port Forwarding (If Needed):**
   - For external access, configure your router to forward port 3389 (the default RDP port) to the internal IP address of the target machine. Refer to your router's documentation for instructions on how to set up port forwarding.

8. **Connect to the Remote Desktop:**
   - Obtain the remote desktop connection details, which include either the "Computer Name" or the "IP Address" of the target machine. These can typically be found within the "System" properties or through command line tools like `ipconfig`.
   - Use a Remote Desktop client (such as Microsoft's built-in Remote Desktop Connection tool) on the external device.
   - Enter the obtained address into the client and initiate the connection.

By following these steps, you will have successfully configured Remote Desktop Services on your Windows system, allowing for secure and efficient remote access.
