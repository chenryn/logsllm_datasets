  * Electron version: 0.37.6
  * Operating system: Ubuntu 16 64-bit
Hi guys,
Trying to bring Electron app on top & focus it when the user pushes a
registered globalShortcut. Nor App.focus() nor BrowserWindow.focus() seems
working on Ubuntu. Could only bring it on top by calling:
    mainWin.setAlwaysOnTop(true);
    mainWin.setAlwaysOnTop(false);
But still no success in focusing it.
