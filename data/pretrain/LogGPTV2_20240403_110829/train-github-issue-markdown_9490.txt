Subject: Issue with Focusing Electron App on Ubuntu via Global Shortcut

Hello Team,

I am currently working on an Electron application (version 0.37.6) running on Ubuntu 16.04, 64-bit. I'm attempting to bring the application window to the front and focus it when a user triggers a registered global shortcut.

Neither `App.focus()` nor `BrowserWindow.focus()` seems to be effective in this scenario. As a workaround, I have managed to bring the application window to the top using the following code:

```javascript
mainWin.setAlwaysOnTop(true);
mainWin.setAlwaysOnTop(false);
```

However, even after bringing the window to the top, I am unable to set the focus on it. Could you please provide some guidance or suggest any alternative methods to achieve this?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
