##### Description of the problem
GLTF2 models that are clones do not displayed correctly. This is for a number
of reasons
  * the onBeforeRender callback is not copied
  * GLTFShader is not cloned across
  * SkinnedModel skeleton is reinitialised to 0 bones and the source skinnedmodel skeleton is not cloned
