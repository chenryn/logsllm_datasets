_I'm sorry if this was discussed before, but I couldn't find anything with
search._
Today I have accidentally deployed a controller with `dump()` in it to an
environment that finally had `debug` flag set to `false` only to see a 500
error page (it was used in an action called asynchronously so I couldn't see
that there are some variables dumped in the toolbar before). While I agree
it's my fault for not catching this before, I also think that penalty doesn't
fit the crime. To make situation like mine a little bit better I'd like to
propose registering all "development" utilities (`dump()` et al) to be
available in prod-like environments, but instead of any heavy lifting, make
them do nothing. I don't have any numbers to back this up, but I believe that
registering a NOP functions/twig methods will not affect overall Symfony
performance. Also any overlooked calls (or even ones left on purpose) should
not compromise applications' loading time. Also for those who want to fine-
tune Symfony, it could be possible to not register dev utils (so get back to
current situation) with a config flag.
What do you think?
