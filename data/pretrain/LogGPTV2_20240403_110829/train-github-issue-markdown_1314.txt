**Description:**

I apologize if this topic has been discussed before, but I was unable to find any relevant discussions through a search.

Recently, I accidentally deployed a controller containing a `dump()` call to an environment where the `debug` flag was set to `false`. This resulted in a 500 error page, which was particularly problematic because the action was called asynchronously, and I couldn't see the dumped variables in the toolbar.

While I acknowledge that this is my fault for not catching it earlier, I believe the penalty (a 500 error) is disproportionate to the issue. To mitigate such situations, I propose the following:

1. **Register "Development" Utilities in Production-Like Environments:**
   - Functions like `dump()` should be available in production-like environments.
   - However, instead of performing their usual heavy lifting, these functions should do nothing (i.e., they should be no-op functions).

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   - I don't have concrete performance metrics, but I believe that registering no-op functions or Twig methods will not significantly impact Symfony's overall performance.
   - Overlooked calls or intentional ones should not compromise the application's loading time.

3. **Configuration Flexibility:**
   - For those who want to fine-tune Symfony, there could be a configuration flag to disable the registration of development utilities, reverting to the current behavior.

What are your thoughts on this proposal?
