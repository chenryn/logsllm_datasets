language, tokenized models, or other neural-networks ar-
chitectures might allow passwords to be guessed more
effectively. While we measured client-side strength met-
rics based on guessing effectiveness, a remaining chal-
lenge is giving user-interpretable advice to improve pass-
words during password creation.
