User: Please briefly introduce the three-way handshake and four-way handshake in the TCP/IP protocol, and explain why these operations are necessary.
Assistant: The TCP/IP protocol is one of the basic protocols of Internet communication, among which three-way handshake and four-way wave are important operations in TCP protocol communication. The three-way handshake means that when a TCP connection is established, the client sends a SYN packet to the server, the server replies a SYN-ACK packet to the client, and the client replies an ACK packet to the server. Only the confirmation of these three messages can establish a connection. The purpose of this process is to confirm that both parties can communicate and confirm the ability of both parties to terminate the connection. If a connection is simply established without a three-way handshake, data transmission may be unstable. Four times of waving means that when the TCP connection is ended, the client sends a FIN packet to the server, the server replies with an ACK packet, and then the server sends a FIN packet to the client, and the client replies with an ACK packet. The purpose of this process is to allow both parties to complete the transmission of unsent data before ending the connection. The server may still need to send some remaining data when replying the ACK packet, and the two parties can terminate the connection after the data transmission is completed. To take a simple example, a three-way handshake is like two people saying hello to each other, confirming that they can communicate with each other, and waving hands four times is like two people confirming that there is nothing missing before saying goodbye, and then terminating the communication. Such an operation effectively avoids data loss and unstable transmission, and ensures the reliability of the TCP connection.
