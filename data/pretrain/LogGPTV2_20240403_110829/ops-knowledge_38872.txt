User: How to write a simple TCP client program using Python.
Assistant: The steps to write a simple TCP client program in Python are as follows: 1. Import the socket module. ``` python import socket ``` 2. Create a socket object. ``` python client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) ``` 3. Set the connection IP address and port number. ``` python server_ip = '127.0.0.1' server_port = 1234 server_address = (server_ip, server_port) ``` 4. Connect to the server. ``` python client_socket.connect(server_address) ``` 5. Send data to the server. ``` python msg = 'Hello, server!' client_socket.send(msg.encode()) ``` 6. Receive data from the server. ``` python recv_msg = client_socket.recv(1024).decode() print('Server says:', recv_msg) ``` 7. Close the client socket connection. ``` python client_socket.close() ``` The complete code is as follows: ``` python import socket client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) server_ip = '127.0.0.1' server_port = 1234 server_address = ( server_ip, server_port) client_socket.connect(server_address) msg = 'Hello, server!' client_socket.send(msg.encode()) recv_msg = client_socket.recv(1024).decode() print('Server says:', recv_msg) client_socket. close() ```
