#### Seagate
Seagate's "cheap" NAS disks are the IronWolf gama, there are
[two variations IronWolf and IronWolf Pro](https://www.nasmaster.com/seagate-ironwolf-vs-seagate-ironwolf-pro/).
Seagate Exos is a premium series of drives from the company. They’re even more
advanced than IronWolf Pro and are best suited for server environments. They
sport incredible levels of performance and reliability, including a workload
rate of 550TB per year.

Exos 7E10 is SMR so it's ruled out.
Where MTBF stands for Medium Time Between Failures in hours
### Data disk conclusion
I'm more interested on the 5400 RPM drives, but of all the NAS disks available
to purchase only the WD RED of 8TB use it, and they use the SMR technology, so
they aren't a choice.
The disk prices offered by my cheapest provider are:
| Disk                 | Size | Price |
| -------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Seagate IronWolf     | 8TB  | 225$  |
| Seagate IronWolf Pro | 8TB  | 254$  |
| WD Red Plus          | 8TB  | 265$  |
| Seagate Exos 7E8     | 8TB  | 277$  |
| WD Red Pro           | 8TB  | 278$  |
WD Red Plus has 5,640 RPM which is different than the rest, so it's ruled out.
Between the IronWolf and IronWolf Pro, they offer 180MB/s and 214MB/s
respectively. The Seagate Exos 7E8 provides much better performance than the WD
Red Pro so I'm afraid that WD is out of the question.
There are three possibilities in order to have two different brands. Imagining
we want 4 disks:
| Combination             | Total Price        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| IronWolf + IronWolf Pro | 958$               |
| IronWolf + Exos 7E8     | 1004$ (+46$ +4.5%) |
| IronWolf Pro + Exos 7E8 | 1062$ (+54$ +5.4%) |
In terms of:
- Consumption: both IronWolfs are equal, the Exos uses 2.7W more on normal use
  and uses 0.2W less on rest.
- Warranty: IronWolf has only 3 years, the others 5.
- Speed: Ironwolf has 210MB/s, much less than the Pro (255MB/s) and Exos
  (249MB/s), which are more similar.
- Sostenibility: The Exos disks are much more robust (more workload, MTBF and
  Warranty).
I'd say that for 104$ it makes sense to go with the IronWolf Pro + Exos 7E8
combination.
## [Choosing the disks for the cache](https://www.nasmaster.com/best-m2-nvme-ssd-nas-caching/)
Using a ZLOG greatly improves the
[writing speed](https://www.servethehome.com/exploring-best-zfs-zil-slog-ssd-intel-optane-nand/),
equally using an SSD disk for the L2ARC cache improves the read speeds and
improves the health of the rotational disks.
The best M.2 NVMe SSD for NAS caching are the ones that have enough capacity to
actually make a difference to overall system performance. It also requires a
good endurance rating for better reliability and longer lifespan, and you should
look for a drive with a specific NAND technology if possible.
Note: If you want a TL;DR you can jump to the
[conclusion](#cache-disk-conclusion).
To choose your disks take into account:
- [Cache disk NAND technology](#cache-disk-nand-technology)
- [DWPD](#dwpd)
### Cache disk NAND technology
Not all flash-based storage drives are the same. NAND flash cells are usually
categorised based on the number of bits that can be stored per cell. Watch out
for the following terms when shopping around for an SSD:
- Single-Level Cell (SLC): one bit per cell.
- Multi-Level Cell (MLC): two bits per cell.
- Triple-Level Cell (TLC): three bits per cell.
- Quad-Level Cell (QLC): four bits per cell.
When looking for the best M.2 NVMe SSD for NAS data caching, it’s important to
bear the NAND technology in mind.
SLC is the best technology for SSDs that will be used for NAS caching. This does
mean you’re paying out more per GB and won’t be able to select high-capacity
drives, but reliability and the protection of stored data is the most important
factor here.
Another benefit of SLC is the lower impact of write amplification, which can
quickly creep up and chomp through a drive’s DWPD endurance rating. It’s
important to configure an SSD for caching correctly too regardless of which
technology you pick.
Doing so will lessen the likelihood of losing data through a drive hanging and
causing the system to crash. Anything stored on the cache drive that has yet to
be written to the main drive array would be lost. This is mostly a reported
issue for NVMe drives, as opposed to SATA.
### DWPD
DWPD stands for drive writes per day. This is often used as a measurement of a
drive’s endurance. The higher this number, the more writes the drive can perform
on a daily basis, as is rated by the manufacturer. For caching, especially which
involves writing data, you’ll want to aim for as high a DWPD rating as possible.
### Cache disk conclusion
Overall, I’d recommend the Western Digital Red SN700, which has a good 1 DWPD
endurance rating, is available in sizes up to 4TB, and is using SLC NAND
technology, which is great for enhancing reliability through heavy caching
workloads. A close second place goes to the Seagate IronWolf 525, which has
similar specifications to the SN700 but utilizes TLC.
| Disk            | Size   | Speed    | Endurance | Warranty | Tech | Price |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | --------- | -------- | ---- | ----- |
| WD Red SN700    | 500 GB | 3430MB/s | 1 DWPD    | 5 years  | SLC  | 73$   |
| SG IronWolf 525 | 500 GB | 5000MB/s | 0.8 DWPD  | 5 years  | TLC  | ?     |
| WD Red SN700    | 1 TB   | 3430MB/s | 1 DWPD    | 5 years  | SLC  | 127$  |
| SG IronWolf 525 | 1 TB   | 5000MB/s | 0.8 DWPD  | 5 years  | TLC  | ?     |
## Choosing the cold spare disks
It's good to think how much time you want to have your raids to be inconsistent
once a drive has failed.
In my case, for the data I want to restore the raid as soon as I can, therefore
I'll buy another rotational disk. For the SSDs I have more confidence that they
won't break so I don't feel like having a spare one.
# Design your pools
## Pool configuration
* [Use `ashift=12` or `ashift=13`](https://wiki.debian.org/ZFS) when creating the pool if applicable (though ZFS can detect correctly for most cases). Value of `ashift` is exponent of 2, which should be aligned to the physical sector size of disks, for example `2^9=512`, `2^12=4096`, `2^13=8192`. Some disks are reporting a logical sector size of 512 bytes while having 4KiB physical sector size , and some SSDs have 8KiB physical sector size. 
  Consider using `ashift=12` or `ashift=13` even if currently using only disks with 512 bytes sectors. Adding devices with bigger sectors to the same VDEV can severely impact performance due to wrong alignment, while a device with 512 sectors will work also with a higher `ashift`.
