∗We remove 13M duplicate accounts from 7k7k, because we identify that they are copied from Tianya as we will detail in Section 3.2.

was originally in the top-10 most popular list of both
datasets. We manually scrutinize the original datasets
(before removing the email addresses and user names)
and are surprised to ﬁnd that there are around 3.91 mil-
lion (actually 3.91*2 million due to a split representation
of 7k7k accounts, as we will discuss later) joint accounts
in both datasets.
In Appendix A, we provide strong
evidence that someone has copied these joint accounts
from Tianya to 7k7k, but not from 7k7k to Tianya as
concluded in previous major studies [26, 34].
3.3 Password characteristics
Language dependence. There is a folklore that user-
generated passwords are greatly inﬂuenced by their na-
tive languages, yet so far no large-scale quantitative
measurement has ever been given. To ﬁll this gap,
we ﬁrst illustrate the character distributions of the nine
datasets, and then measure the closeness of passwords
with their native languages in terms of inversion number
of the character distributions (in descending order).
As expected, passwords from different
language
groups have signiﬁcantly varied letter distributions (see
Fig. 1). What’s unexpected is that, even though
generated and used in vastly diversiﬁed web services,
passwords from the same language group have quite
similar letter distributions. This suggests that, when
given a password dataset, one can largely determine
what the native language of its users is by investigating
its letter distribution. Arranged in descending order, the
letter distribution of all Chinese passwords is aineo
hglwuyszxqcdjmbtfrkpv, while this distribution for
all English passwords is aeionrlstmcdyhubkgpjvfw
zxq. While some letters (e.g., ‘a’, ‘e’ and ‘i’) occur
frequently in both groups, some letters (e.g., ‘q’ and ‘r’)
only occur frequently in one group. Such information
can be exploited by attackers to reduce the search space
and optimize their cracking strategies. Note that, here
all the percentages are handled case-insensitively.
While users’ passwords are greatly affected by their
native languages,
frequency of general
language may be somewhat different from the letter
frequency of passwords. To what extent do they differ?
According to Huang et al.’s work [28],
the letter
the letter
distribution of Chinese language (i.e., written Chinese
texts like literary work, newspapers and academic
papers), when converted into Chinese Pinyin,
is

This shows that
some letters (e.g., ‘l’ and ‘w’), which are popular in
Chinese passwords, appear much less frequently in
written Chinese texts. A plausible reason may be that
‘l’ and ‘w’ is the ﬁrst letter of the family names li and
wang (which are the top-2 family names in China),
respectively, while Chinese users, as we will show, love
to use names to create their passwords.
A similar observation holds for passwords of English
speaking users. The letter distribution of English lan-
guage (i.e., etaoinshrdlcumwfgypbvkjxqz) is from
