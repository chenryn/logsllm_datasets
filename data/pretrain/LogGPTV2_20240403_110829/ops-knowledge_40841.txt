Assistant: Whether there is an exception: no exception Description: The log information is a normal application log. From the log information, it can be seen that when the application queries the detailed information about the number of steps of the day, it calls the "Step_SPUtils" function and outputs the query results in the form of strings. The format of the query result is "timestamp##steps##mileage##calories##activity##version number", where timestamp, steps, mileage, calories, activity and version number respectively represent the current timestamp , the number of steps of the day, the mileage of the trip of the day, the calories burned of the day, the activity level of the day (the unit is not yet determined) and the application version number. Therefore, the log information does not contain any abnormal information.
