#### Deploy and Test the Application
To deploy Pet Store on Mac OS X Server:
1. Copy the configured files to **/Library/JBoss/3.2/deploy**. (Alternatively, you can use the management tool to deploy the application. See “Deploying Applications” on page 59 for details.)
2. After about a minute, open **http://localhost:8080/petstore** in your web browser. You can also save the EAR files directly to the JBoss deploy directory, but it is generally safer to configure application files of undeployed archives.

Follow these steps to test Pet Store:
1. Open **http://localhost:8080/petstore** in a web browser.
2. Click the link that takes you to the store.
3. On the **Welcome to the BluePrints Petstore** webpage, click **Birds**.
4. On the **Items** webpage, click **Amazon Parrot**.
5. On the **Product** webpage, click **Add to Cart**.
6. On the **Cart** webpage, click **Check Out**.
7. On the **Sign On** webpage, click **Sign In**.
8. On the **Enter Order Information** webpage, click **Submit**.

If you encounter an error page during the test, ensure that JBoss is running and recheck the configuration settings described in “Configure the Pet Store Enterprise Application” (page 29) and “Configure the Supplier Enterprise Application” (page 39).

### Administering Application Servers

#### Logging In to the Management Tool
Before logging in to the management tool, ensure that the tool is running. You can launch the management tool by executing the following command:
```sh
$ /Library/JBoss/Applications/JBossManagement.woa/JBossManagement
```
You can log in to the management tool through your web browser by entering the following URL into the address bar: **https://localhost:40000**.

Alternatively, you can click **Manage JBoss** in the **Settings** pane in the **Server Admin** window.

To log in to the management tool, you must enter the username and password of an administrator of your computer or a user who is a member of the **appserveradm** group or the **appserverusr** group.

There are two types of users with the authority to use the management tool:
- **Administrator users** (members of the **appserveradm** group)
- **Monitor users** (members of the **appserverusr** group)

The user defined while configuring Mac OS X Server for the first time is added to the **appserveradm** group. To authorize another user to manage application servers with the management tool, execute the following command and restart your computer:
```sh
$ sudo /usr/bin/dscl . -create Groups/appserveradm GroupMembership <username>
```

To authorize a user to only monitor application servers with the management tool, execute the following command and restart the computer:
```sh
$ sudo /usr/bin/dscl . -create Groups/appserverusr GroupMembership <username>
```

You can also use **NetInfo Manager** to add users to the **appserveradm** and **appserverusr** groups:
1. Launch **NetInfo Manager** located in **/Applications/Utilities**.
2. If the lock in the bottom-left corner of the window is locked, click it and authenticate yourself as the server’s administrator.
3. In the **/** column, select **groups**. Then select the appropriate group in the **groups** column.
4. In the **Properties** list, select **users** and choose **Directory > New Value**.
5. Replace **new_value** with the appropriate username.
6. Save the changes and restart your computer.

#### Choosing a Task
After logging in to the management tool, the **Configuration** window appears, allowing you to choose the kind of activity you want to perform. There are three activities to choose from:
- **Managing**: Allows you to start and stop services, configure services, observe resource statistics, create data sources, create topics or queues, and deploy applications.
- **Configuring**: Lets you start and stop services, create data sources, create topics or queues, and deploy applications.
- **Monitoring**: Allows you to observe resource statistics of application servers.

#### Managing Application Servers
To manage an application server, enter the JNDI port of the application server (default: 1099) in the **Configuration** window, and click **Manage localhost**.

The left side of the **JBoss Management Console** window lists the available application servers and their resources. You specify the resource you want to manage by clicking the triangle next to the appropriate resource type and selecting a resource from the list.

For example, to change an application server’s security configuration, click the triangle next to the **Services** resource group and select **login-config.xml**. The **Security Configuration** pane will appear on the right side of the window, showing the application policy list, which you can modify by clicking the appropriate buttons. Any changes take effect after restarting the application server.

When managing the services deployed on the application server, you can also monitor the statistics of deployed applications and resources. For example, if you deploy Sun’s Pet Store, log in to the management tool, choose to manage the application server, and click **local/ShoppingCartEJB** under **cart-ejb.jar** under **petstore.ear** under the **Applications** group, the **Statistics** pane will display information on the performance of the **ShoppingCart** enterprise bean.

When done managing, click **JBoss** in the server list, and click **Logout** or **Change Configuration**.

#### Configuring Application Servers
To configure local application servers, choose the configuration you want to modify from the **Modify configuration** drop-down menu, and click **Modify configuration** in the **Configuration** page.

The **JBoss Management Console** window allows you to select a service and change its configuration. For example, to configure the transaction-connection factory service, select **jms-ds.xml** under **services** in the application-server list.

You can also configure the provider and the session pool of the transaction-connection factory service by clicking the triangle next to **jms-ds.xml** in the application-server list and selecting the appropriate item.

#### Monitoring Application Servers
To monitor application servers, enter the name of the computer on which the application server is running (default: **localhost**) and the JNDI port of the application server (default: 1099) in the **Configuration** page, and click **Monitor host**.

To view the statistics provided by particular applications, resources, or services, select the appropriate item in the application-server list. The statistics will appear in the **Statistics** pane.

Note: After making changes, you must restart the application server for the changes to take effect.

#### Starting and Stopping Services
You can start and stop services while managing or configuring application servers. In the application server list, select the application server you want to configure, and click **Start/Stop Services** in the **Host Information** pane. The **Start or Stop Services** pane will be displayed on the right side of the **JBoss Management Console** window.

#### Creating a Data Source
You can create a data source while managing or configuring application servers. Select the application server you want to add the data source to in the server list. Enter the name of the data source in the **Datasource Name** text field in the **Create a Datasource** group in the **Host Information** pane, choose a data-source type from the **Datasource Type** drop-down menu, and click **Create Datasource**.

Enter the appropriate information in the **Local TX Datasource** pane, and click **Update**. The newly added data source will appear under the **Resources** group in the application-server list.

#### Creating a Topic or a Queue
You can create a topic or a queue while managing or configuring an application server. Follow these steps:
1. In the application server list, select the application server you want to add the topic or queue to.
2. From the **Topic or Queue** drop-down menu in the **Create a Topic or Queue** group in the **Host Information** pane, choose **Topic** or **Queue**.
3. In the **Topic or Queue Name** text field, enter the name of the topic or queue.
4. Enter the name of the file in which the topic or queue configuration is to be saved in the **Filename** text field.

#### Deploying Applications
You can deploy applications while managing or configuring application servers. Follow these steps:
1. Select the application server you want to deploy the application or service on in the application server list.
2. In the **Select an application to deploy** group in the **Host Information** pane, click **Choose File**, and select the file to deploy.
3. Click **Deploy Application**.

Note: Ensure you enter a unique JNDI name in the **Jndi Name** text field of the **Local TX Datasource** pane.

### Balancing User Load and Replicating Sessions

#### Distributable Applications
Before deploying an application in a cluster of nodes using the **deploy-cluster** configuration, make sure that the application is distributable. To make an application distributable, set **Distributable** to **yes** in the **Web-App** pane.
