### Weaponize Your PETS!?!?!
(Continued from the previous section)

---

### Background

- **Internet Traffic:** Approximately 15% of global internet traffic is dedicated to cat-related content.
- **Engagement:** I use cat pictures in tech briefings to keep the audience engaged.

---

### Just Finished a Presentation…

- **Incident:** Someone offered me a tracking collar they won.
  - Features:
    - GPS
    - Cellular
    - Continuous location tracking
- **Idea:** Add a Wi-Fi sniffer to create a "War Kitteh" that can map Wi-Fi access points.

---

### What About the DoS Dog?

- **Event:** AT Outerz0ne
- **Incident:** LadyMerlin walked in with a dog wearing a harness labeled "Denial of Service Dog."
- **Idea:** Incorporate a Pineapple (Wi-Fi router) into the harness for a functional DoS device.

---

### Working Animals

- **Examples:**
  - Bad Ass Working Animals
  - Badder Ass Working Animals
  - Real Navy SEALs
  - Flipper (Dolphin)

---

### Other Research Efforts

- **Acoustic Kitty:** A CIA project to use cats for espionage.

---

### Requirements for War Kitteh

- **Concept of Operations (CONOP):**
  - Equip a cat with a collar/harness containing a GPS tracker and Wi-Fi sniffer.
  - Map Wi-Fi access points as the cat roams.
- **Requirements:**
  1. **Safety:** The cat must not be harmed.
  2. **Comfort:** The collar/harness must be comfortable and safe for the cat.
  3. **GPS Tracking:** Record waypoints with date/time stamps.
     - Optional: On-demand locational data.
  4. **Wi-Fi Sniffing:** Sync with GPS and collect Wi-Fi SSIDs and other signals for analysis.

### Cat Coat

- **Plan:**
  1. Embed technology in a coat.
  2. Place the coat on the cat.
  3. Send the cat on a walkabout.
  4. Recover data when the cat returns.
  5. Profit.

### Lessons Learned

- **Challenges:**
  - Cats are difficult to work with.
  - Always test before deploying expensive equipment.
  - Amazon Prime account is useful.
  - Concerns about the cat's well-being led to abandoning the coat.
  - Need a smaller form factor with the same capabilities.

---

### Discussion with Friend Bill

- **Hobbyist & Technologist**
- **Arduino:**
  - Small form factor
  - Low power consumption
  - Customizable solutions

---

### What is Arduino?

- **Description:** An open-source electronics platform for interactive projects.
- **Features:**
  - Expansion boards (Shields)
  - Applications: Robots, remote control cars, home security products, etc.

---

### Arduino Mini

- **Advantages:**
  - Open Source
  - Inexpensive
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Poorly documented
  - Long delivery times
  - Questionable performance

---

### My Experience

- **Background:**
  - No prior experience with Arduino
  - Some experience with firmware and small chip sets
  - Basic coding and soldering skills

---

### Plan

1. **Learn about Arduino:**
   - Acquire basic components
2. **Select the most suitable form factor for WarKitteh**
3. **Integrate the components into a collar**
4. **Develop the DoS Dog concept**

---

### Learning Arduino

- **Basic Components:**
  - Arduino Uno
  - Flashy Things
  - Cooler Stuff (Wi-Fi, GPS, SD card libraries)
- **Resources:**
  - Jeremy Blum Videos: [Website](http://jeremyblum.com)

---

### Progress

- **Components:**
  - Arduino WiFi Shield
  - Itead Studio GPS Shield
