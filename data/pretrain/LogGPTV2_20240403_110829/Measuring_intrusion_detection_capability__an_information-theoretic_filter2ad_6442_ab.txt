tection Capability
Our goal is to deﬁne a metric that measures the capa-
bility of an IDS to classify the input events correctly. At
an abstract level, the purpose of an IDS is to classify the
input correctly as normal or intrusive. That is, the IDS
output should faithfully reﬂect the “truth” about the in-
put (i.e., whether an intrusion occurs or not). From an
information-theoretic point of view, we should have less un-
certainty about the input, given the IDS output. Mutual
information is a proper yardstick because it captures the re-
duction of original uncertainty (intrusive or normal) given
that we observe the IDS alerts.
We propose a new metric, Intrusion Detection Capability,
or CID, which is simply the ratio of the mutual information
between IDS input and output to the entropy of the input.

Figure 2: Relationship between entropy and mutual
information. For example, H(X) = I(X; Y ) + H(X|Y ).
On the right, the entropy H(Y ) is much larger than
H(X). This reﬂects a likely IDS scenario, where the
base rate is very small (close to zero), so H(X) is
nearly zero. On the other hand, the IDS may pro-
duce quite a few false positives. Thus, H(Y ) can be
larger than H(X).
Deﬁnition 4. Let X be the random variable representing
the IDS input and Y the random variable representing the
IDS output. Intrusion Detection Capability is deﬁned as
CID =
I(X; Y )
H(X)

As discussed in Section 2.1, mutual information measures
the reduction of uncertainty of the input by knowing the
IDS output. We normalize it using the entropy (i.e., the
original uncertainty) of the input. Thus, CID is the ratio
of the reduction of uncertainty of the IDS input, given the
IDS output.
Its value range is [0, 1]. Obviously, a larger
CID value means that the IDS has a better capability of
classifying input events accurately.
CID can also be interpreted in the following way. Consider
X as a stochastic binary vector that is the “correct assess-
ment” of the input data stream S, i.e., the correct indica-
tion whether each stream unit is an intrusion or not. The
detection algorithm is a deterministic function acting on S,
yielding a bitstring Y that should ideally be identical to X.
The IDS has to make correct guesses about the unknown X,
based on the input stream S. The actual number of required
binary guesses is H( X), the “real” information content of
X. Of these, the number correctly guessed by the IDS is
I( X; Y ) (see Figure 2 for the intersection H(X) H(Y )).
Thus, I( X; Y )/H( X) is the fraction of correct guesses.
Using the deﬁnitions in Section 2.1 and the abstract model
of IDS input (X) and output (Y ), shown in Figure 1, we
can expand CID and see that it is a function of three basic
variables: base rate (B), F P (α), and F N (β). When B = 0
or B = 1 (i.e., the input is 100% normal or 100% intrusion),
H(X) = 0. We deﬁne CID = 1 for these two cases.
From Figure 3(a), we can see the eﬀect of diﬀerent base
rates on CID. In realistic situations in which the base rate
(B) is very low, an increase in B will improve CID. We
should emphasize that the base rate is not normally con-
trolled by an IDS. However, it is an important factor when
studying intrusion detection capability.
Figure 3(a) clearly shows that for low base rates, it is
better to decrease F P than F N in order to achieve a better
CID. For example, suppose we have an IDS with a base
rate B = 10−5, and a F P = 0.1, and F N = 0.1.
If we
decrease the F P from 0.1 to 0.01 (a ten-fold decrease), the

(a) Realistic environment (base rate
B plots in log-scale). Compare the
two sets of
lines for changes in α
against ﬁxed β values. If the base rate
is small, changes in α are more signif-
icant than changes in β.
(b) The eﬀect of F P (α).
For a
small base rate B (ﬁxed in this plot),
even tiny changes in α produce large
changes in CID.
(c) The eﬀect of F N (β). For a small
base rate B (ﬁxed in this plot), only
large changes in β have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on CID.
Figure 3: Intrusion Detection Capability. For a realistic low base rate, CID is more sensitive to changes in α
than changes in β.
CID moves from 0.1405 to 0.3053. If we instead decrease the
F N from 0.1 to 0.01, the CID only moves from about 0.1405
to 0.1778. Thus, for very low base rates, a reduction in F P
yields more improvement in intrusion detection capability
than the same reduction in F N . This is intuitive as well,
if one realizes that both F N and F P are misclassiﬁcation
errors. When the base rate is low, there are more normal
packets that have a chance of being misclassiﬁed as F P .
Even a large change in F N may not be very beneﬁcial if
few attack packets are at risk for misclassiﬁcation as F N .
A formal proof that CID is more sensitive to F P than to
F N is given in our technical report [8].
We know that in the perfect case where F P = F N = 0,
CID is always the same (CID = 1) because the IDS classiﬁes
the events without a mistake. For realistic (low) base rates,
the eﬀects of F P and F N are shown in Figures 3(b) and
3(c). CID will improve with a decrease in both F P and
F N . Note that any reasonable (or “allowable”) IDS should
have detection rate greater than the false positive rate (1 −
F N > F P ). That is, an IDS should be doing better than
random guessing, which has F P =F N =50%. Thus, when
1 − F N  I(X; Y ). We also know that a change
in F N will cause only a very slight change of I(X; Y ). (Re-
call the discussion above, where a low base rate implies there
are few attack packets exposed to the risk of being misclas-
siﬁed as F N .) Thus, a change in F N actually has very little
eﬀect on the change in N M I.
Furthermore, consider the plots in Figure 3(c) with Fig-
ure 4(c). For equivalent ranges of F N , the y-axis for the
NMI plot in Figure 4 ranges from 0 to 0.07, while the axis
for the CID ranges from 0.1 to 0.6. Thus, CID is almost an
order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in F N than
N M I. Similarly, the corresponding F P plots in Figures 3(b)
and 4(b) show that CID is approximately 100 times as sen-
sitive to equivalent shifts in F P as N M I. For all these
reasons, N M I is not a good measure of intrusion detec-
tion capability.
In other domains, where the relationship
H(X)  H(Y ) does not apply, N M I may be a suitable
metric.
N M I is a symmetric measure. There is an asymmetric
measure called NAMI (Normalized Asymmetric Mutual In-
formation) in [23], which is deﬁned as N AM I = I(X; Y )/H(Y ).
This metric has the same problem as N M I in that it is rela-
tively insensitive to changes in F N . In realistic IDS scenar-
ios, the base rate is low, and H(X)  H(Y ). Accordingly,
H(Y ) ≈ H(X, Y ). Thus, N AM I ≈ N M I, and is unsuitable
for an intrusion detection metric.
3. ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON
This section provides an in-depth analysis of existing IDS
metrics and compares them with the new metric CID.
3.1 ROC Curve-Based Measurement
An ROC curve shows the relationship between T P and
F P , but by itself, it cannot be used to determine the best
IDS operation point. The ROC curves can sometimes be
used for comparing IDSs. If ROC curves of two IDSs do not
“cross” (i.e., one is always above the other), then the IDS
