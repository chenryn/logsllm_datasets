User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: Instead of calling ipython directly, it is loaded using Python such as 
$ python "full path to ipython.exe"
