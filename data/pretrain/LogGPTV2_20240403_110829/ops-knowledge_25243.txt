User: I have a Twisted application that runs in an x86 64bit machine with Win 2008 server. 
It needs to be connected to a SQL Server database that runs in another machine (in a cloud actually but I have IP, port, db name, credentials).
Do I need to install anything more that Twisted to my machine?
And which API should be used?
Assistant: If you want to have portable mssql server library, you can try the module from www.pytds.com.
It works with 2.5+ and 3.1, have a good stored procedure support. It's api is more "functional", and has some good features you won't find anywhere else.
