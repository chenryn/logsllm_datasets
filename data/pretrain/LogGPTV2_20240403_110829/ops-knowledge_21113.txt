User: I have installed the Enthought Python distribution on my computer, but I don't have any idea how to use it. I have PyLab and IDLE but I want to run .py files by typing the following command:

python fileName.py

I don't know where to write this command: IDLE, PyLab or Python.exe or Windows command prompt. When I do this in IDLE it says:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Please help me to figure this out.
Assistant: Open a command prompt: Press ⊞ Win  and R at the same time, then type in cmd and press ↵ Enter
Navigate to the folder where you have the ".py" file (use cd .. to go one folder back or cd folderName to enter folderName) 
Then type in python filename.py
