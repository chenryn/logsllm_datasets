# Environment
    Windows build number:  [Version 10.0.18363.900]
    PowerToys version: 0.18.2
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): Fancy Zones
# Steps to reproduce
Set up remote desktop connection in a zone and start it in full screen mode
afterwards. It wont be in the zone anymore. Instead it will be covering all
zones like without even having the PowerToys installed.
# Expected behavior
A full screen app will think it is running in full screen inside of a fancy
zone. This could also be seen as a feature request, to me it is a bug though.  
Unlike remote desktop, which is only annoying in window mode, other apps like
games don't even allow you to switch to window mode, leaving fancy zones
useless in those scenarios.  
**With 4k screens nowadays, this is important!**
# Actual behavior
When an app switches to full screen, it sadly breaks out of the zone. It will
cover all zones instead.
