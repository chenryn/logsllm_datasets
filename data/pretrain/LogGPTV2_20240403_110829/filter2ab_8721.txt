**Title: Botconf 2019 - Tracking Botnets with Long-Term Sandboxing**

Sandbox systems have become a powerful tool for analyzing malware behavior, offering rapid and automated insights. However, their analysis duration is typically limited to just a few minutes, which hinders the observation of long-term malware behavior and the detection of significant changes.

To address these limitations, we have developed a Long-Term Sandboxing (LTS) system. This system enables extended, automated analysis of malware behavior, allowing us to track botnets over longer periods. Our LTS system has been enhanced with advanced network traffic and system resource analysis capabilities, enabling in-depth investigation of various network protocols, including DNS, HTTP(S), and SMTP.

In our presentation, we will demonstrate how our LTS system is used to monitor both the infrastructure and operations of botnets, providing valuable insights into their activities and evolution.
