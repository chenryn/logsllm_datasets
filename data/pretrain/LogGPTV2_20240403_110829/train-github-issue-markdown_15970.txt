React 16 components can have multiple root elements.
`const Items = ({ items }: MyProps) => items.map(item => {item.name})`
However, TypeScript will break with:  
`error TS2605: JSX element type 'Element[]' is not a constructor function for
JSX elements. Property 'render' is missing in type 'Element[]'.`
