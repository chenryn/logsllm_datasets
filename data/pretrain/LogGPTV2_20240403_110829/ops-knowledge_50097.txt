User: I'm new to twisted. I was wondering if I can use multiple sync clients to connect to a twisted server? Or I have to make the client twisted as well?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Clients do not have to be written w/ twisted (they don't even have to be written in Python); they just have to use a protocol that your server supports.
