Abstract—Bitcoin has become the most popular cryptocur-
rency based on a peer-to-peer network. In Aug. 2017, Bitcoin was
split into the original Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
Since then, miners have had a choice between BTC and BCH
mining because they have compatible proof-of-work algorithms.
Therefore, they can freely choose which coin to mine for higher
proﬁt, where the proﬁtability depends on both the coin price
and mining difﬁculty. Some miners can immediately switch the
coin to mine only when mining difﬁculty changes because the
difﬁculty changes are more predictable than that for the coin
price, and we call this behavior ﬁckle mining.
In this paper, we study the effects of ﬁckle mining by modeling
a game between two coins. To do this, we consider both ﬁckle
miners and some factions (e.g., BITMAIN for BCH mining) that
stick to mining one coin to maintain that chain. In this model, we
show that ﬁckle mining leads to a Nash equilibrium in which only
a faction sticking to its coin mining remains as a loyal miner to
the less valued coin (e.g., BCH), where loyal miners refer to those
who conduct mining even after coin mining difﬁculty increases.
This situation would cause severe centralization, weakening the
security of the coin system.
To determine which equilibrium the competing coin systems
(e.g., BTC vs. BCH) are moving toward, we traced the historical
changes of mining power for BTC and BCH and found that BCH
often lacked loyal miners until Nov. 13, 2017, when the difﬁculty
adjustment algorithm of BCH mining was changed. However, the
change in difﬁculty adjustment algorithm of BCH mining led to
a state close to the stable coexistence of BTC and BCH. We
also demonstrate that the lack of BCH loyal miners may still be
reached when a fraction of miners automatically and repeatedly
switches to the most proﬁtable coin to mine (i.e., automatic
mining). According to our analysis, as of Dec. 2018, loyal miners
to BCH would leave if more than about 5% of the total mining
capacity for BTC and BCH has engaged in the automatic mining.
In addition, we analyze the recent “hash war” between Bitcoin
ABC and SV, which conﬁrms our theoretical analysis. Finally,
we note that our results can be applied to any competing
cryptocurrency systems in which the same hardware (e.g., ASICs
or GPUs) can be used for mining. Therefore, our study brings
new and important angles in competitive coin markets: a coin
can intentionally weaken the security and decentralization level
of the other rival coin when mining hardware is shared between
them, allowing for automatic mining.
I. INTRODUCTION
Bitcoin [1] is the most popular cryptocurrency based on a
distributed and public digital ledger called blockchain. Nodes
in the Bitcoin network store the blockchain, where transactions
are recorded in a unit of a block, and the blockchain is
extended by generating new blocks. The process of generating
new blocks is referred to as mining, and nodes conducting
mining activities are referred to as miners. To successfully
mine, miners should ﬁnd a solution called the proof-of-work
(PoW) [2]. In Bitcoin, miners are required to solve a crypto-
graphic puzzle ﬁnding a hash value to satisfy speciﬁc condi-
tions such as a certain number of leading zeroes. To solve a
puzzle, miners spend their computational power, and the miner
who ﬁnds the solution obtains 12.5 coins and the transaction
fees in the new block as a reward. In addition, Bitcoin has an
average block interval of 10 minutes by adjusting the mining
difﬁculty (i.e., the difﬁculty of the puzzles).
As Bitcoin has gained popularity, the transaction scalability
issue has risen, and several solutions have been proposed to
address the issue. However, there were also several conﬂicts
over these solutions. As a result, in Aug. 2017, the Bitcoin
system was split into the original Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin
Cash (BCH) [3], [4]. The key idea of BCH is to increase
a maximum block size to process more transactions than
BTC. However, even with different block size limits, they
have compatible proof-of-work mechanisms with each other.
Therefore, miners can freely alternate between BTC and BCH
mining to boost
their proﬁts [5]. The mining proﬁtability
changes when the mining difﬁculty and coin price change,
but some miners may be concerned only with the change in
former because it is relatively easier to predict the former
than the latter. More precisely, rational miners can decide
which cryptocurrency is better to mine depending on the coin
mining difﬁculty — BCH mining would be conducted by the
miner only if the BCH mining difﬁculty is low compared to
the BTC mining difﬁculty; otherwise, the miner does BTC
mining rather than BCH mining. We call this miner’s behavior
“ﬁckle mining” in this paper. Note that the ﬁckle miner may
change the coin to mine at a speciﬁc time period whenever
the coin mining difﬁculty changes. Thus, ﬁckle mining leads
to instability of mining power, which may eventually cause
unstable coin prices [5].
Game model and analysis.
In this study, we aim to analyze
the economics of ﬁckle mining rigorously, which can later be
extended to show how one coin can lead to a lack of loyal
miners for other less valued coins. Here, a loyal miner repre-
sents one who conducts mining the less valued coin even after
the coin mining difﬁculty increases. To study the economics

of ﬁckle mining, we propose a game theoretical framework
of players who can conduct ﬁckle mining between two coins
(e.g., BTC and BCH). Moreover, our game model reﬂects
coin factions that stick to mining their own coins, as they are
interested in only the maintenance of their systems rather than
the payoffs. Then we analyze Nash equilibria and dynamics in
the game; two types of equilibria exist: the stable coexistence
of two coins and the lack of loyal miners for the less valued
coin. More speciﬁcally, in the latter case, only some factions
(e.g., BITMAIN for BCH mining) remain as loyal miners for
the less valued coin, and this fact can eventually make the
coin system severely centralized, weakening its security. We
describe the game model in Section IV and analyze the game
in Section V.
Data analysis for BTC vs. BCH. Next, as a case study,
we analyzed the mining power changes in BTC and BCH
to see if our theoretical analysis matches with actual mining
power changes. In this paper, we refer to the Bitcoin system
as a coin system consisting of BTC and BCH. We examine
the mining power history in the Bitcoin system from the
release date of BCH until Dec. 2018 to 1) analyze which
equilibrium its state has been moving to and 2) evaluate
our theoretical analysis empirically. Our analysis results show
that until the BCH mining difﬁculty adjustment algorithm
changed (on Nov. 13, 2017), the Bitcoin state reached a lack
of loyal miners for BCH. Therefore, BCH periodically became
severely centralized before the update of the BCH protocol.
For example, we observe a period when only ﬁve miners exist,
of which two miners possess about 70 % power. However,
since Nov. 13, 2017,
the Bitcoin state has been close to
coexistence because the change in the BCH mining difﬁculty
adjustment algorithm with a shorter difﬁculty adjustment time
interval (i.e., every block) has affected the game as an external
factor.
Nevertheless, we explain that the state would still get closer
to a lack of BCH loyal miners if automatic mining, in which
miners automatically choose the most proﬁtable coin to mine,
is popularly used. Note that the main difference between ﬁckle
mining and automatic mining is that ﬁckle miners immediately
change their coin only when the mining difﬁculty changes
while automatic miners can immediately change their coin
when not only the mining difﬁculty but also the coin price
changes. As a result, at the time of writing (Dec. 2018), if
5% of the total mining power of the Bitcoin system involves
automatic mining, the current loyal miners for BCH would
leave, weakening its security.
Data analysis for Bitcoin ABC vs. SV. As another case
study in our game model, we also analyze the changes in
the hash rate distributions of Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV,
before and after the recent “hash war” between those two
coins. The analysis results of these case studies are presented
in Section VI and VII.
Generalization. Moreover, we remark that our analysis can
be generalized to any circumstance wherein two coins have
compatible PoW mechanisms with each other. We believe
that the generalized results bring new important angles in
competitive coin markets; a coin can attempt to steal loyal
miners from other rivalry coins that have compatible PoW
mechanisms. In Section VIII, a risk of automatic mining and
the way to intentionally reduce the number of loyal miners
for other coins are described. Then, in Section IX, we discuss
countermeasures and environmental factors that may make the
actual coin states deviate from our game analysis.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
1) To analyze the economics of ﬁckle mining, we ﬁrst
model a game between two coins, considering some coin
factions that stick to mining their own coin.
2) We analyze Nash equilibria and dynamics in the game
and ﬁnd two types of equilibria: 1) stable coexistence of
two coins and 2) a lack of loyal miners to the less valued
coin. Then, we apply this game to the Bitcoin system.
3) To determine if real-world miners’ behaviors follow our
model, we investigate the mining power history in the
Bitcoin system. Then we show that the state reached the
lack of BCH loyal miners until Nov. 13, 2017, and we
conﬁrm that this fact periodically led the BCH system to
be centralized and insecure. Moreover, for generalization,
we also analyze the recent “hash war” situation between
Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV according to our game
model.
4) We introduce a risk of automatic mining and predict that
the current BCH loyal miners would leave when 5%
of the total mining power in BTC and BCH involves
automatic mining.
5) Finally, our game is generalized to any mining-
compatible coins (e.g. Ethereum vs. Ethereum Classic).
Therefore, our study brings a threat that one coin can
intentionally steal loyal miners from other less valued
coin.
II. PRELIMINARY
A. Cryptocurrency
Many cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
Litecoin adopt the PoW mechanism as a consensus algorithm.
In the PoW mechanism, when a node solves a cryptographic
puzzle, the node can generate and propagate a valid block.
Then other nodes append the generated block to the existing
blockchain. The puzzle is to ﬁnd an inverse image of a hash
function satisfying the certain condition, and thus the node
should spend computational power to solve the cryptographic
puzzle. The process of generating a block is called mining, and
nodes participating in mining are called miners. In systems,
the mining difﬁculty is adjusted to maintain the average time
of generating one block. In particular, Bitcoin mining difﬁculty
is adjusted to keep the average period of generating one block
at 10 minutes. In addition, to incentivize mining, whenever a
miner ﬁnds a valid block, the miner earns the reward for one
block in compensation for the computational power spent. For
example, currently, miners earn the block reward of 12.5 coins
in the Bitcoin system when they ﬁnd one block.

Many people have become involved in mining because
of the incentive for mining, and specialized hardware for
efﬁcient mining such as application-speciﬁc integrated circuits
(ASICs) has appeared. Based on the above reasons, the vast
computational power is used for mining, and mining difﬁculty
has increased signiﬁcantly. Therefore, it should take a solo
miner, who mines alone, a signiﬁcantly long time to ﬁnd a
valid block, and this causes solo miners to wait for a long time
to earn block rewards. To reduce not only node costs and but
also the variance of their rewards, mining pools where miners
gather together for mining have been organized. Most pools
are composed of workers and a manager. The manager gives
puzzles to workers, and they solve the puzzles. If a worker
solves a given puzzle, the block reward is distributed to the
workers in the pool.
In the past years, there have been many attacks on and
problems with cryptocurrency systems, and these attacks or
problems have even caused cryptocurrency systems to split.
For example, because Bitcoin has become a popular cryptocur-
rency, the system needs to provide high transaction throughput.
To address the scalability issue, several solutions such as
Segregated Witness [6] and unlimited block size have been
proposed. Because of the debate on the proposed solutions,
Bitcoin was eventually split into BTC and BCH in early Aug.
2017. Even though BCH chose to increase the block size limit
in order to allow more transactions per block, the mining
protocol of BCH was designed to be compatible with that
of BTC. Therefore, miners can conduct both BTC and BCH
mining with one hardware device.
B. Fickle mining
Before Nov. 13, 2017, BCH adjusted the mining difﬁculty
every 2016 block to ensure that the average time period for
generating a block is 10 minutes, like in the case of BTC. In
doing so, if the time required for generating past 2016 blocks
is longer than two weeks, the mining difﬁculty decreases,
and miners can generate subsequent blocks more easily. In
addition, BCH added a new difﬁculty adjustment algorithm
