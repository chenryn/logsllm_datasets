VSCode also offers a real-time collaboration extension (github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share). Data is end-to- 
end encrypted using the SSH protocol. In order for all users in a session to have read-write privileges, they must 
use a Microsoft or GitHub account. If you require live collaboration functionality, I recommend setting up a 
covert account on GitHub instead of using a Microsoft account. If you do not require real-time collaboration 
with team members, there is no reason to install Liveshare.
VSCodium is an open-source clone built from the VSCode source. It removes the Microsoft data collection in 
exchange for a slightly more complicated configuration process. VSCodium offers most of VSCode’s 
capabilities. If you are not already using Office or other Microsoft products, this is the best choice for you. 
Although the bulk of data sharing is disabled by default, it is recommended that you review all application 
settings and look for any which use "online services". There is no substitute for reviewing configuration settings 
yourself. VSCodium presents a slightly less polished user experience. Some extensions require additional 
installation steps and there is a much smaller community from which to draw support. VSCodium is available 
on macOS, Windows, and Linux using the package managers which were previously explained.
VSCode is very close to being a fully functional IDE and it has a huge following in the programming and web 
development communities due to its extensive catalogue of available extensions. Extensions are plugins which 
add additional features and customizations such as interface themes. While the source code is open, the 
application itself is a proprietary free Microsoft product and its primary weakness is the standard telemetry and 
data collection that accompanies most Microsoft products. Therefore, VSCode is a good option for someone 
already working in a Microsoft enterprise environment. In addition to simple text capabilities, VSCode supports 
mark-down. This makes it a good tool for both notes and also for working on our custom tool files. It has a 
very responsive interface and does not bog down when dealing with large files. It has arguably the largest 
collection of extensions of any editor in its class and it supports running code should you want to customize 
some scripts. The standard install includes a terminal so you can run CMD, PowerShell, or bash from within the 
application. Real-time collaboration features can be added via the Live-Share extension. VSCode is available for 
macOS, Windows, and Linux.
Following installation, immediately review all settings and disable telemetry'. You can accomplish this by selecting 
"File" > "Preferences" > "Settings" or "Code" > "Preferences" > "Settings". Using the search box, submit a 
query for "telemetry’" and uncheck "Telemetry’: Enable Telemetry setting". Now search for 
"@tag:usesOnlineServices" and review the settings which make calls to online services such as those querying 
for extension updates. Disabling these will reduce your exposure to Microsoft but may limit some functionality’ 
such as automatic updates and notifications. Although the diverse offerings when it comes to extensions present 
a great deal of power and customizability, it can be a little overwhelming at first. I recommend the following 
extensions for note-taking and basic work with HTML and other common web filetypes.

Although some investigators choose to write their reports as they go, I prefer to use handwritten and digital 
notes to complete the formal report at the conclusion of the investigation. I have created a series of templates 
in Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat, each of which are available in the digital files download, which provide 
a polished documentation framework for the most common mission scenarios. Al though they vary in format, 
each contains a common structure including face-sheet, narrative, analysis, and appendix.

The face-sheet is typically one or two pages and is the most important piece of any report, t is meant to quic 
convey the most important intelligence. The mark of a good face-sheet is that a boss or c lent can g ance a

subject identifiers, and a concise set of key findings. The key findings can be in bullet or paragrap orma

On 11/14/2019 Detective Johansen widi the Homicide Unit requested mv assistance in identifying and locating a 
possible witness to a shooting death diat occurred at 4200 N Jackson St. on November 12th, 2019. Detective 
Johansen provided me witlr a tip sheet wherein an anonymous caller purported that the Twitter handle 
“@Jakijumpjorp66” had posted photos of the shooting as it took place. No further information was provided by 
the anonymous complainant.
I researched user “@Jakijumpjorp66” using a flesh Clrrome browser witliin a newly configured virtual machine. 
These best practices ensure that die online research is free from cross contamination with other casework I 
conducted keyword searches of the username against the site Twitter.com using Google, Bing, \andex, Baidu, Sear, 
ahoo, Duckduckgo, and Exalead. Google returned a result that showed a photo that was cleady from the 
intersection in question. I browsed to the corresponding page on twitter
(https:/ /twitter.com/Jakijumpiorp66/media) and preserved a copy of die page using die Fileshot extension in my 
Chrome browser (see appendix item 3.46). The photo depicted a man clearly firing a liandgun in front of a signage 
tor “ 1 om’s Waterbed Warehouse.” I saved a digital copy of die photo at die highest resolution available and placed 
it in die digital media archive which is included in the optical media attached to this report.
Not all reports will contain an analysis section, but this is where I present graphical components that support 
understanding of the preceding narrative. These include timelines of key events and link chans mapping out 
relationships between individuals, groups, locations, and internet sites. In my organization, this type of 
specialized work is often handled by civilian analysts who arc proficient in software such as Maltego or 12 
Analyst's Notebook. 1 provide them with a copy of my face-sheet, narrative, and a hand drawn map of the case 
entities and corresponding relationships. They use these to construct a more professional, visually appealing,

One small quirk that I have noticed when working with Draw.io in my VM is that when I choose to save my 
project the pop-up window is hidden behind the chart window. The easiest way to bring it to the front is to click 
the "Activities" button at the top left of the VM window which will show you all open windows. Click the file 
section window and it will pop back on top of all other open applications. The Activities button is a great way 
to find lost windows if you have several applications or terminal windows open at once.
