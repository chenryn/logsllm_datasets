### Terminal Plus
- **macOS**: `brew install visual-studio-code`
- **Windows**: `choco install -y vscode`
- **Linux**: `sudo snap install --classic code`

**VSCode** also offers a real-time collaboration extension, [Live Share](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share). Data is end-to-end encrypted using the SSH protocol. For all users in a session to have read-write privileges, they must use a Microsoft or GitHub account. If you require live collaboration functionality, I recommend setting up a covert GitHub account instead of using a Microsoft account. If real-time collaboration with team members is not necessary, there is no need to install Live Share.

### VSCodium
VSCodium is an open-source clone built from the VSCode source. It removes Microsoft's data collection, but the configuration process can be slightly more complex. VSCodium offers most of VSCode’s capabilities. If you are not already using Office or other Microsoft products, VSCodium is the best choice for you. Although the bulk of data sharing is disabled by default, it is recommended that you review all application settings and disable any that use "online services." There is no substitute for reviewing configuration settings yourself. VSCodium presents a slightly less polished user experience, and some extensions require additional installation steps. The community support is also smaller compared to VSCode. VSCodium is available on macOS, Windows, and Linux using the package managers mentioned earlier.

### VSCode
VSCode is very close to being a fully functional IDE and has a large following in the programming and web development communities due to its extensive catalog of available extensions. Extensions are plugins that add additional features and customizations, such as interface themes. While the source code is open, the application itself is a proprietary free Microsoft product. Its primary weakness is the standard telemetry and data collection that accompanies most Microsoft products. Therefore, VSCode is a good option for someone already working in a Microsoft enterprise environment. In addition to simple text capabilities, VSCode supports markdown, making it a good tool for both notes and working on custom tool files. It has a very responsive interface and does not slow down when dealing with large files. It has arguably the largest collection of extensions of any editor in its class and supports running code, which is useful for customizing scripts. The standard install includes a terminal, so you can run CMD, PowerShell, or bash from within the application. Real-time collaboration features can be added via the Live Share extension. VSCode is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Post-Installation Configuration
After installing VSCode, immediately review all settings and disable telemetry. You can do this by selecting "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings" or "Code" > "Preferences" > "Settings." Use the search box to submit a query for "telemetry" and uncheck "Telemetry: Enable Telemetry setting." Next, search for `@tag:usesOnlineServices` and review the settings that make calls to online services, such as those querying for extension updates. Disabling these will reduce your exposure to Microsoft but may limit some functionality, such as automatic updates and notifications. Although the diverse offerings when it comes to extensions present a great deal of power and customizability, it can be overwhelming at first. I recommend the following extensions for note-taking and basic work with HTML and other common web file types:
- **HTML Preview**: [GitHub](https://github.com/george-alisson/html-preview-vscode)
- **Default Browser**: [GitHub](https://github.com/peakchen90/vscode-open-in-default-browser.git)
- **PowerShell**: [GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell.git)
- **Python**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python)
- **Prettier Code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode.git)

### Installation Instructions for VSCodium
- **macOS**: `brew install vscodium`
- **Windows**: `choco install -y vscodium`
- **Linux**: `sudo snap install codium --classic`

### Documentation & Reporting
The face-sheet is typically one or two pages and is the most important piece of any report. It is meant to quickly convey the most critical intelligence. A well-crafted face-sheet allows a boss or client to glance at it and instantly know the case name/number, who collected the intelligence, the investigative timeframe, key subject identifiers, and a concise set of key findings. The key findings can be in bullet or paragraph form and should not exceed half a page. If you choose to include a table of contents, place it under the case title and before the key findings. Figure 30.02 displays an example of a simple face-sheet, while Figure 30.03 shows a full report version.

If you are limited on time or supporting a field operation, such as fugitive apprehension, the face-sheet may be the only form of documentation required. It is not unusual to receive "profile" requests while other investigators are looking for assistance in identifying accounts, addresses, phone numbers, and associates. This also makes for a convenient quick reference sheet during future cases or incidents involving the same subjects. Events also get intelligence sheets that concisely address need-to-know elements such as hashtags, pertinent groups, and operational contacts. It should have everything you would want to monitor public social media posts and live video streams. Figure 30.04 displays an event intelligence sheet.

### Narrative
The narrative follows the face-sheet and tells the story. This is your opportunity to describe your key findings. I like to organize my narrative either chronologically or by findings as listed on the face-sheet. Writing in the first person and as concisely as possible is essential, especially if your report will be used in courtroom testimony. Write just enough to provide context and a clear understanding of discovered intelligence. This section can range from a couple of paragraphs to several pages, depending on the complexity of the case.

Although some investigators choose to write their reports as they go, I prefer to use handwritten and digital notes to complete the formal report at the conclusion of the investigation. I have created a series of templates in Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat, each of which provides a polished documentation framework for the most common mission scenarios. Although they vary in format, each contains a common structure, including a face-sheet, narrative, analysis, and appendix.

It is important to acknowledge and address any discoveries that impact the investigative findings. Ensure that all evidence is represented in your reporting, especially for those working in criminal justice and government sectors. If your report takes the form of an intelligence brief, your audience may expect confidence levels associated with your conclusions. Use terms such as "possible," "likely," or "highly likely," rather than expressing the chances in percentages.

### Best Practices
This section describes the best practices used during the online investigation. Key points to be made here include compartmentalization from other casework, thoroughness of research, software and services used, and a brief on why they should be trusted.

### Event Intelligence Sheet
An event intelligence sheet concisely addresses need-to-know elements such as hashtags, pertinent groups, and operational contacts. It should have everything you would want to monitor public social media posts and live video streams. Figure 30.04 displays an event intelligence sheet.

### Link Analysis & Timelines
Not all reports will contain an analysis section, but this is where I present graphical components that support the preceding narrative. These include timelines of key events and link charts mapping out relationships between individuals, groups, locations, and internet sites. In my organization, this type of specialized work is often handled by civilian analysts proficient in software such as Maltego or i2 Analyst's Notebook. I provide them with a copy of my face-sheet, narrative, and a hand-drawn map of the case entities and corresponding relationships. They use these to construct a more professional, visually appealing, and detailed graphical representation of the criminal organization or series of events. Not every investigator has these resources available, but if you do, leveraging one of the following tools can be beneficial:

- **Draw.io**: [Integrations](https://www.diagrams.net/integrations.html)
- **Visual Investigative Scenarios**: [VIS](https://vis.occrp.org/account/metro)
- **Gephi**: [Gephi](https://gephi.org)
- **Visual Site Mapper**: [VSM](https://visualsitemapper.com)

### Case Example
On 11/14/2019, Detective Johansen with the Homicide Unit requested my assistance in identifying and locating a possible witness to a shooting death that occurred at 4200 N Jackson St. on November 12th, 2019. Detective Johansen provided me with a tip sheet wherein an anonymous caller purported that the Twitter handle "@Jakijumpjorp66" had posted photos of the shooting as it took place. No further information was provided by the anonymous complainant.

I researched user "@Jakijumpjorp66" using a fresh Chrome browser within a newly configured virtual machine. These best practices ensure that the online research is free from cross-contamination with other casework. I conducted keyword searches of the username against the site Twitter.com using Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu, Yahoo, Duckduckgo, and Exalead. Google returned a result that showed a photo clearly from the intersection in question. I browsed to the corresponding page on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Jakijumpjorp66/media) and preserved a copy of the page using the Fileshot extension in my Chrome browser (see appendix item 3.46). The photo depicted a man clearly firing a handgun in front of a sign for "Tom’s Waterbed Warehouse." I saved a digital copy of the photo at the highest resolution available and placed it in the digital media archive, which is included in the optical media attached to this report.

### Conclusion
By following these guidelines and using the appropriate tools, you can create comprehensive, professional, and effective reports for your investigations.
