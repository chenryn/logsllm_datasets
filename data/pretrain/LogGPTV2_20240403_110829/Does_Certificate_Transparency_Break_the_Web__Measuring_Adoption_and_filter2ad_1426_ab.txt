### Data Collection and Analysis

#### A. Chrome User Metrics Program
Data for this study is sourced from the Chrome User Metrics Program, specifically from the Stable channel. This program collects metrics in various forms, including enums, booleans, counts, and times. For our analysis, we utilize the following metrics:
- The count of Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) per connection and page load.
- An enum representing Certificate Transparency (CT) compliance status for each connection, HTTP request, and Extended Validation (EV) certificate validation.
- An enum of the error code displayed each time a certificate warning is shown.
- The time taken to verify HTTPS certificates and SCTs.

The metrics reports include client information such as the operating system and country but do not include personal characteristics like age or gender. The Chrome User Metrics Program is enabled by default, but users can opt out during installation or through browser settings. Prior to October 2016, the metrics program was disabled by default.

#### B. Certificate Error Reports
To investigate the websites causing the most CT-related errors in Chrome and to understand user reactions, we use a separate Chrome telemetry system designed for gathering detailed data about certificate errors. These error reports provide more granular information than the usage metrics described above, including:
- The hostname of the website where the error occurred.
- The full certificate chain.
- Whether the user chose to bypass the warning.

Given the potential privacy implications, this data is collected only on an opt-in basis. Users can opt in or out via a checkbox on the certificate error UI. Previous research has provided a detailed description of this dataset [18].

#### C. Server Support
Browser usage statistics are heavily skewed towards a small number of highly popular websites, which limits the granularity of information about CT adoption. To gain a broader perspective, we also analyze CT adoption in terms of server support. We use three different lists of websites to measure CT adoption across both popular and less popular sites.

1. **Stable Channel**: The Stable channel is considered the most representative for measurement purposes due to its large user base and default release status. More details can be found at: https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel.

2. **Googlebot Data**: To determine CT compliance, we analyze data produced by Googlebot, Google's web crawler. When crawling an HTTPS URL, Googlebot records the certificate and any SCTs, along with their source (TLS extension, OCSP response, or embedded in the certificate).

   We developed an analysis tool that processes Googlebot records from January 2018 for each website. If a website responds with a valid certificate over HTTPS, the tool validates each SCT, ensuring it comes from a log trusted by Chrome and has a valid signature. It checks the certificate and SCTs against the Chrome CT policy (described in Section II-C). A domain is considered CT-compliant only if all observed certificates are CT-compliant, providing a conservative estimate of CT adoption.

   Note that we only consider the main resource of each website and do not analyze subresources, a standard limitation in measurement research based on server scans. Future work could explore the CT compliance of subresources, though we do include subresource information in data based on Chrome user metrics.

3. **Website Lists**:
   - **Alexa Top 10,000**: Contains the top 10,000 ranked domains based on traffic estimates from Alexa toolbar users and website analytics scripts [19]. We requested the Alexa list on February 5, 2018. The list aggregates subdomains into a single domain label.
   - **Chrome User Experience Report**: A public dataset of user experience measurements on a sample of websites [20]. The list is derived from browsing traffic of Chrome users who have opted in to share their data. We use the list of 1,939,945 websites from the December 2017 report.
   - **HTTP Archive**: Provides a view of performance and functional characteristics of the web [21]. The sites scanned are derived from the Alexa million, representing the web's long tail. We fetched the list of 458,969 websites scanned on January 15, 2018, from the HTTP Archive’s BigQuery table.

#### D. CT Logs
We analyze the contents of CT logs to identify patterns of certificate issuance that affect end users, particularly related to Chrome’s CT enforcement for EV certificates. We use a July 6, 2018, snapshot from a pipeline that ingests all the contents of 36 well-known CT logs.

#### E. Chrome Product Help Forums
To study user reactions to CT errors, we reviewed CT-related posts in the Chrome product help forum. We analyzed 75 public threads matching the error code ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED. We coded the threads using a general inductive approach [22], developing a codebook of 18 labels. Two researchers independently coded each thread, and we computed a Kupper-Hafner statistic [23] of 0.63, indicating substantial agreement [24]. While this dataset is limited to a self-selected set of users and lacks demographic information, it provides naturalistic case studies of user reactions to CT errors.

### Adoption

In this section, we measure the current state of CT adoption and examine its growth over time. Gradual adoption helps mature the CT ecosystem without widespread disruption to end users, allowing early identification and resolution of issues.

#### A. Adoption Measured from Chrome

1. **Current Adoption**: As of the week ending February 1, 2018, the majority of HTTPS traffic is CT-compliant. Of the HTTP requests evaluated for CT compliance, 71.1% were CT-compliant, and 63.2% of HTTPS connections were CT-compliant.

2. **Growth Over Time**: CT adoption saw significant growth in 2015 and 2016, followed by a period of stability and recent renewed growth. Figure 4 shows the historical trend in Chrome traffic supporting CT, considering main-frame HTTPS page loads and HTTPS connections. We use the number of valid SCTs as a proxy metric for CT compliance, as current data suggests that noncompliance due to invalid SCTs is rare.

   - **Main-Frame HTTPS Page Loads**: Shows a steady rise in adoption, likely corresponding with CT enforcement for EV certificates.
   - **Mid-2016 Bump**: Likely driven by Chrome’s enforcement of CT logging for new certificates issued by Symantec-owned CAs.
   - **Recent Increase**: Possibly due to upcoming CT enforcement for certificates issued after April 30, 2018.

#### B. Understanding CT Adoption from Server Support
We examine server scans to see which websites have adopted CT and why. Table I shows the percentage of sites responding over HTTPS with a valid certificate and the percentage of those that are CT-compliant, as measured from January 2018 web crawler records. A small percentage serve SCTs but do not comply with the Chrome CT policy.

- **CT Adoption Across Websites**: CT adoption is approximately even across the Alexa Top 10,000, with no significant correlation between rank and CT compliance (p = 0.43). However, CT adoption lags in the long tail.

1. **Reasons for Adoption**: Most sites adopt CT due to browser requirements or support from major ecosystem players. Table II shows the characteristics of CT-compliant websites:
   - **EV Certificates**: Websites using EV certificates must support CT to receive Chrome’s EV UI treatment.
   - **Symantec CA**: Websites using certificates issued by Symantec-owned CAs, which Chrome requires to be logged if issued after June 1, 2016.
   - **Cloudflare**: Cloudflare logs all certificates it serves, even though many of its hosted websites are not required to be logged.
   - **GlobalSign**: GlobalSign began embedding SCTs in all certificates in fall 2017, motivated by Chrome’s upcoming CT enforcement.

### Compliance

How successfully do websites comply with Chrome’s CT policy when required? Noncompliance can lead to broken pages or warnings. Possible causes of noncompliance include developer choice, CA bugs, or misconfigurations in CT support implementation.

#### A. Blocked Connections
When a website fails to comply with the CT policy, Chrome blocks the connection, resulting in a certificate warning or a subresource failing silently. In the week ending February 1, 2018, 15% of HTTPS connections were expected to be CT-compliant. We find that the rate of noncompliance among these connections is very low, even historically when new CT enforcement requirements have rolled out.

#### B. Reasons for Adoption
Most sites adopt CT due to browser requirements or support from major ecosystem players. Table II shows the characteristics of CT-compliant websites:
- **EV Certificates**: Websites using EV certificates must support CT to receive Chrome’s EV UI treatment.
- **Symantec CA**: Websites using certificates issued by Symantec-owned CAs, which Chrome requires to be logged if issued after June 1, 2016.
- **Cloudflare**: Cloudflare logs all certificates it serves, even though many of its hosted websites are not required to be logged.
- **GlobalSign**: GlobalSign began embedding SCTs in all certificates in fall 2017, motivated by Chrome’s upcoming CT enforcement.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of CT adoption and compliance, highlighting the role of browser requirements and ecosystem support in driving CT adoption.
