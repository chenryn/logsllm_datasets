data from Chrome’s user metrics program, on the Stable
channel1. Metrics are collected in the form of enums, booleans,
counts, and times. In this paper, we use: the count of SCTs per
connection and page load; an enum of CT compliance status
per connection, HTTP request, and EV certiﬁcate validation;
an enum of the error code each time a certiﬁcate warning is
shown; and the times to verify HTTPS certiﬁcates and SCTs.
Metrics reports include client information such as operating
system and country, but they do not include personal charac-
teristics like age or gender. Chrome’s user metrics program
is enabled by default, but users can choose to opt out at
installation time or in browser settings. (Prior to October 2016,
the metrics program was disabled by default.)
B. Certiﬁcate error reports
To investigate the websites that cause the most CT-related
errors in Chrome and understand how users react to them, we
use a separate Chrome telemetry system that is speciﬁcally
designed for gathering data about certiﬁcate errors. These error
reports contain more detailed information than can be collected
via the usage metrics described in Section III-A. For example,
the reports contain the hostname of the website on which the
error occurred, the full certiﬁcate chain, and whether the user
chose to bypass the warning. Because this information can be
privacy-sensitive, it is only collected on an opt-in basis. Users
can opt in and out of the data collection with a checkbox on
the certiﬁcate error UI shown in Fig. 1. Prior work describes
the characteristics of this dataset in detail [18].
C. Server support
Browser usage statistics are heavily weighted towards a
relatively small number of extremely popular websites, and
do not give us ﬁne-grained information about which sites have
adopted CT. For a broader view, we also study CT adoption in
terms of server support. We use three different lists of websites
to measure CT adoption on the head and long-tail of the web.
1The Stable channel is considered the most representative for measurement
purposes because it has the largest set of users and is the default release
channel for installation. See https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-
channel for more details.
To determine CT compliance on these websites, we analyze
data produced by Googlebot (Google’s web crawler). When
crawling an HTTPS URL, Googlebot records the certiﬁcate
and SCTs, if any. It also records the source of each SCT (TLS
extension, OCSP response, or embedded in the certiﬁcate).
We built an analysis tool that consumes Googlebot records
from January 2018 for each website. If the website responded
with a valid certiﬁcate over HTTPS, the tool validates each
SCT seen for the domain, checking that it comes from a
log trusted by Chrome and that
the signature is valid. It
checks the certiﬁcate and SCTs against the Chrome CT policy,
which is described in Section II-C. If multiple certiﬁcates and
corresponding SCTs were observed for a domain, we consider
the domain to be CT-compliant only if all observed certiﬁ-
cates were CT-compliant. This approach yields a conservative
estimate of CT adoption, because it does not count sites as
compliant if they were only sometimes compliant.
Note that we only consider the main resource of each
website, and do not analyze the CT compliance of each
subresource that the website loads. This is a standard limitation
in measurement research based on server scans. Analyzing
the CT compliance of subresources is an interesting avenue
for future work,
though we do include information about
subresources in data based on Chrome user metrics.
Below we describe the lists of websites that we analyze.
1) Alexa Top 10,000: The Alexa Top 10,000 contains the
top 10,000 ranked domains from trafﬁc estimates based on
Alexa toolbar users and website analytics scripts [19]. We
requested the Alexa list on February 5, 2018.
The Alexa list is composed of domains, and it rolls up sub-
domains into one domain label below the effective TLD. For
example, trafﬁc for https://a.example.test, https:
//a.b.example.test, and http://example.test
is all aggregated under a single ranking for example.test.
(Exceptions are made for some domains like blogspot.com
which host different personal webpages as subdomains.)
2) Chrome User Experience Report: The Chrome User
Experience Report
is a public dataset of user experience
measurements on a sample of websites [20]. The report aims
to provide a broad snapshot of the web from the perspective
of Google Chrome users. The list of websites is chosen from
the browsing trafﬁc of Chrome users who have opted in to
share aspects of their browsing data with Google. The list is

available as a public BigQuery project. In this paper, we use
the list of 1,939,945 websites provided in the December 2017
report2. The report includes a scheme and full hostname for
each website, and does not include rankings.
3) HTTP Archive: For another view of CT adoption in the
long tail, we use the domains scanned by the HTTP Archive,
a project that records a view of various performance and
functional characteristics of the web [21]. The sites scanned
by the HTTP Archive are derived from the Alexa million3,
which is commonly used to represent the web’s long tail. We
fetched the HTTP Archive’s list of sites scanned on January
15, 2018 from its BigQuery table4, a total of 458,969 websites.
D. CT logs
We analyze the contents of CT logs for patterns of certiﬁcate
issuance that affect end users, particularly related to Chrome’s
CT enforcement for EV certiﬁcates. We use a July 6, 2018
snapshot from a pipeline that ingests all the contents of 36
well-known CT logs5.
E. Chrome product help forums
To study how users react
to CT errors, we reviewed
CT-related posts in the Chrome product help forum6. We
reviewed the 75 public threads matching a search term
for
the error code that Chrome displays for CT errors
(ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED). We
coded the threads using a general inductive approach [22].
After reviewing all the threads to develop a codebook of
18 labels, two researchers independently coded each thread,
applying one or more labels from the codebook to each thread.
The set of labels is listed in the Appendix. To measure inter-
rater reliability, we computed a Kupper-Hafner statistic [23]
of 0.63, which is considered “substantial” agreement [24].
This dataset is limited to a small self-selected set of users,
and it lacks demographic information. Nevertheless, the help
forum threads yield several interesting and naturalistic case
studies illustrating how users react to CT errors.
IV. ADOPTION
In this section, we measure the current state of CT adoption
and examine how and why it has grown over time. We hope to
see gradual growth in CT adoption because it encourages the
CT ecosystem to mature without widespread disruption to end
users. Gradual adoption ﬂushes out problems early on before

they cause widespread negative impact. For example, if a CA
begins embedding SCTs in certiﬁcates before a browser begins
requiring them to do so, the CA may ﬁnd and ﬁx problems in
their implementation before those problems result in certiﬁcate
errors for users. We analyze why websites have adopted CT,
and we ﬁnd that CT adoption is largely driven by browser
requirements and the support of major ecosystem players.
A. Adoption measured from Chrome
1) Current adoption: The majority of HTTPS trafﬁc is
currently CT-compliant. We consider Chrome metrics for the
week ending February 1, 2018, and we measure requests and
connections. Multiple HTTP requests can share the same con-
nection. Of HTTP requests during this time period for which
CT compliance was evaluated7, 71.1% were CT-compliant.
63.2% of HTTPS connections were CT-compliant.
2) Growth over time: CT adoption grew dramatically in
2015 and 2016, then leveled off and recently began growing
again. Fig. 4 shows the historical trend in Chrome trafﬁc that
supports CT. We consider two metrics: main-frame HTTPS
page loads and HTTPS connections. The former represents a
lower-bound on user-visible impact when full CT enforcement
rolls out. The latter represents failures that might or might not
be visible to end-users when full CT enforcement rolls out.
Users will probably not suffer for a noncompliant connection
that loads a tracking pixel, but a connection that loads a
core Javascript library could easily break an entire webpage,
resulting in a poor user experience.
For both of these metrics, we do not have historical data
for CT compliance, but rather for the number of SCTs. A
connection could have multiple SCTs yet still not comply
with Chrome’s CT policy (for example, because the logs
represented by the SCTs do not meet Chrome’s requirement).
However, current data suggests that this failure mode is quite
rare, as shown by the small number of sites in Table I that
serve SCTs but are not CT-compliant. We therefore consider
the number of valid SCTs to be a reasonable proxy metric.
Fig. 4 illustrates how Chrome’s stages of CT enforcement
have driven CT adoption. The beginning of the graph shows a
small but steady rise in adoption among main-frame HTTPS
page loads, likely corresponding with CT enforcement for EV
certiﬁcates (discussed further in Section V-B). The bump in
mid-2016 could be driven by Chrome’s enforcement of CT
logging for new certiﬁcates issued by Symantec-owned CAs.
Finally, though CT adoption remained steady for much of
2017 and the beginning of 2018, a recent increase can be
seen towards the end of the graph’s time period, likely due
to Chrome’s upcoming CT enforcement for certiﬁcates issued
after April 30, 2018.
7Chrome does not evaluate CT compliance for non-encrypted requests,
requests that are served from the HTTP disk cache, and connections for
which the HTTPS certiﬁcate fails to validate (e.g. an expired or self-
signed certiﬁcate) or chains to a locally installed root. We disregard such
connections and requests because they would not be affected by broadening
CT enforcement, so they are not of interest to our study.

upcoming CT enforcement for all new certiﬁcates [25].
There may be some overlap among these categories: for
example, a website can have a Symantec-issued EV certiﬁcate.
Browser enforcement (the EV, Symantec, and GlobalSign
categories) and CDN support (Cloudﬂare) therefore drive a
large portion of CT adoption. In Section V-A, we analyze
the websites that are left behind with buggy or absent CT
support despite browser requirements, usually due to bugs or
misconﬁgurations in their CA’s implementation of CT.
V. COMPLIANCE
How successfully do websites comply with Chrome’s CT
policy when Chrome requires them to comply? When they
fail to comply, what is the cause? Noncompliance negatively
affects users because it can lead to broken pages or warnings.
A website might fail to comply with a browser’s CT policy
due to developer choice or CA bugs. Some CAs and certiﬁcate
owners choose not to log certiﬁcates because they don’t want
the certiﬁcate information to be public. Another possible cause
of noncompliance is a bug or misconﬁguration in the code that
implements CT support. Such a problem can occur at a CA
(when a CA is embedding SCTs into a certiﬁcate) or at a
web server (for servers that implement their own CT support).
Similar problems have arisen in the past when browsers rolled
out new certiﬁcate requirements [26], [27].
We quantify two consequences of CT compliance failures
that can occur in Chrome: (1) blocked connections, where
a website or resource is blocked from loading due to CT
noncompliance, and (2) EV downgrades, where a website loses
its EV certiﬁcate UI due to CT noncompliance. In the week
ending February 1, 2018, 15% of HTTPS connections were
expected to be CT-compliant, meaning that either the connec-
tion would be blocked or its EV status would be removed if
noncompliant. We ﬁnd that the rate of noncompliance among
these connections is very low, even historically when new CT
enforcement requirements have rolled out.
A. Blocked connections
When a website is required to comply with the CT policy
but doesn’t, Chrome fails the connection, resulting in a certiﬁ-
cate warning (Fig. 1) or a subresource silently failing. At the
Fig. 4. The percentage of main-frame HTTPS page loads and HTTPS
connections with at least two valid SCTs, as measured from Chrome from
April 2015 through May 2018.
B. Understanding CT adoption from server support
We examine server scans to see which websites have
adopted CT and why. Table I shows the percentage of sites that
respond over HTTPS with a valid certiﬁcate and the percentage
of those that are CT-compliant, as measured from January
2018 web crawler records. A small percentage serve SCTs
but do not comply with the Chrome CT policy.
CT adoption is approximately even across the Alexa Top
10,000. We performed a logistic regression to predict CT
compliance from Alexa rank among the Alexa Top 10,000
that support HTTPS, and a Wald test found no evidence that
rank is a predictor (p = 0.43). However, CT adoption does
lag in the long tail, as can be seen in Table I.
1) Reasons for adoption: In our dataset, most sites that
have adopted CT appear to have done so because Chrome
required them to, or because they are served by a major
ecosystem player that is invested in CT’s success. Table II
shows the characteristics of CT-compliant websites among the
websites we considered. Each table cell shows the percent of
CT-compliant websites that may have adopted CT for one of
the following reasons.
• EV: The website uses an EV certiﬁcate and therefore
must support CT to receive Chrome’s EV UI treatment.
• Symantec: The website uses a certiﬁcate issued by a
Symantec-owned CA. Chrome requires such certiﬁcates
to be logged if issued after June 1, 2016.
• Cloudﬂare: Most websites served by Cloudﬂare are not
required to be logged by any browser, but Cloudﬂare logs
all certiﬁcates that it serves nevertheless. This category
in the table contains certiﬁcates obtained by Cloud-
ﬂare for their hosted websites, which we identiﬁed by
the presence of a *.cloudﬂaressl.com subject name or
“CloudFlare, Inc.” issuer name in the certiﬁcate. This ex-
cludes Cloudﬂare-hosted websites for which the customer
provides their own certiﬁcate; Cloudﬂare logs and serves
SCTs for these certiﬁcates as well.
• GlobalSign: In fall 2017, the GlobalSign CA began em-
bedding SCTs in all certiﬁcates, motivated by Chrome’s
