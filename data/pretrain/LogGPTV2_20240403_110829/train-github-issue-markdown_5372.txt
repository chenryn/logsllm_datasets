Electron version: 1.7.6  
Operating system: Windows 7
Same as #8828
I am using 1.7.6 and still facing the same issue. It gets stuck at spooling.
It works fine when I am running the app from the command line for development
but does not work if I install the app using .exe file. It was working
properly on my dev machine but when we released it in production then all our
users complained about printing not working. It gets stuck at spooling in
their machine and nothing gets printed. It does not show any size of the file
as well. Please let me know if there is any fix for this.
Attaching the screenshot of the issue happening at user's device:
