User: I need to be able to open a document using its default application in Windows and Mac OS. Basically, I want to do the same thing that happens when you double-click on the document icon in Explorer or Finder. What is the best way to do this in Python?
Assistant: If you want to specify the app to open the file with on Mac OS X, use this:
os.system("open -a [app name] [file name]")
