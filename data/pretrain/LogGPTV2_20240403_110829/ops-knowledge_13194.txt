User: Please provide a deployment scheme of a Rancher-based Kubernetes cluster, and explain how to use Rancher to manage and monitor applications.
Assistant: Rancher-based Kubernetes cluster deployment scheme: 1. First, a Rancher Server needs to be created to manage and monitor the Kubernetes cluster. You can choose a Kubernetes-ready host on the cloud service provider, and then install Docker and Rancher Server on the host. 2. Create a Kubernetes cluster, which can be configured and operated through the Rancher UI. In the Rancher UI, you can add nodes and containers, configure applications, create Kubernetes services and deployments, set up monitoring, and more. 3. Through the Rancher Catalog, you can select and install already packaged applications. Catalog provides a variety of container applications and images, which can be selected on demand and quickly deployed. Use Rancher to manage and monitor applications: 1. In the Rancher UI, open the "Applications" page to create a new application. You can select an existing Kubernetes service or create a new one. The name, description, and running parameters of the service can all be set. 2. After creating a new application, you can set the release settings, set the label and release description for the service, select the version, and so on. Deployment is then ready, and Rancher will deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster. 3. In the Rancher UI, you can view the resource usage of each node in the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. It can monitor the running status of Kubernetes services in real time, and perform troubleshooting and maintenance. 4. Rancher UI also provides detailed monitoring of Kubernetes clusters. You can view the CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic of each container, as well as the health indicators of the entire cluster. Alerts and notification mechanisms can be set up, as well as automatic scaling up and down of the number of containers. In short, Rancher provides a powerful Kubernetes cluster deployment and management solution, and can quickly deploy, expand and monitor through the UI.
