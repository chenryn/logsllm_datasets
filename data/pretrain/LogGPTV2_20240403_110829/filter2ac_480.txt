**ATT&CK ID:** T1590.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** IP Addresses

Adversaries may gather the victim's IP addresses to use during targeting. Public IP addresses are often allocated to organizations in blocks or as a range of sequential addresses. Information about assigned IP addresses can include various details, such as which IP addresses are currently in use. By collecting and analyzing these IP addresses, adversaries can derive additional information about the victim, including:

- **Organizational Size:** The number of IP addresses in use can provide insights into the size of the organization.
- **Physical Locations:** IP addresses can be geolocated, revealing the physical locations of the organization's facilities or network infrastructure.
- **Internet Service Provider (ISP):** The IP address block can indicate the ISP used by the organization.
- **Publicly-Facing Infrastructure:** Adversaries can determine where and how the organization's publicly-facing infrastructure is hosted, such as web servers, email servers, and other external services.

This information can be valuable for adversaries in planning and executing targeted attacks.
