User: I'm trying to do some package manipulation (a la dpkg) and while I can just popen or subprocess.call I'd rather do things the python way if possible.
Unfortunately I've been unable to find a python module to do the trick.
I've seen reference to python-deb but it appears to be defunct. python-apt might seem like a potential solution, but AFAICT it cannot handle individual .deb files. 
Anyone know of a good dpkg python solution?
Assistant: I have little familiarity with python modules for debs, but I wanted to point out that calling subprocesses isn't the bad thing on *ix, that it is on Windows.  Windows almost seems intended to break calling things as a subprocess and parsing output, but *ix usually makes it quite viable.
