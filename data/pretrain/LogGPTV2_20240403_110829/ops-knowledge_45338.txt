I am using a custom authentication system for my Python Google App Engine application. Currently, the "username" field in the logs for every request is empty. Is it possible to automatically populate this field with the name of the authenticated user? I would prefer not to manually add `"user: %s" % user.name` to all of my `logging.xxx` statements.

**Solution:**
To achieve this, you can add a single `logging.debug` call in your authentication code to log the current user. Since logs are aggregated by request, you will always be able to see the user associated with each request.

Thank you.
