User: I use a custom authentication for my python Google App Engine app.
There is a "username" field in the log for every request, which is empty now. Is it possible to add the name of the authenticated user to the log? I would not like to add an "user: %s" % user.name manually to all of my logging.xxx statements.
Thanks.
Assistant: Add a single logging.debug call in your authentication code to log the current user. Logs are shown aggregated by request, so you'll always be able to see the user associated with that request.
