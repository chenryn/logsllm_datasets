## Abstract
Effective SSL warnings can alert users to network attacks or potential phishing sites. Much research has focused on optimizing visual elements such as text, colors, and symbols to improve user comprehension and adherence. However, these visual enhancements do not necessarily benefit individuals with visual impairments who rely on screen readers. To evaluate the non-visual aspects of SSL warnings, we conducted an expert assessment of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox's SSL certificate dialogues using JAWS and Apple VoiceOver screen readers. Our findings indicate that these warnings are often inaccessible with assistive technology and, even when accessible, fail to effectively communicate threat sources, at-risk data, or false positives. Future work will explore the effectiveness of potential non-visual redesigns through usability studies with visually impaired screen reader users.

## 1. Introduction
Common security advice recommends using HTTPS websites for sharing sensitive information online [10]. Early studies suggested that users often ignored browser security indicators [5], but recent large-scale field studies have shown that well-designed SSL warnings can significantly deter users from potential dangers [1].

In this study, we conduct an expert evaluation to determine whether the audible outputs from browser SSL warnings and dialogues are comprehensible and effective for screen reader users. We assess the audible feedback provided by desktop and mobile screen readers when using Chrome and Firefox, based on design principles from usable security literature. Our main contributions include:
- An expert evaluation of SSL dialogues via desktop and mobile screen readers.
- Early recommendations for designing non-visual security warnings for users who rely on screen reading software.

## 2. Background
Security warnings have long been recognized as poorly accessible [8]. Despite this, and the increasing reliance of visually impaired individuals on the internet for tasks like online banking and social media, the accessibility of security warnings remains underexplored.

Research on the accessibility of cybersecurity has primarily focused on understanding the general security concerns of visually impaired users and proposing novel solutions such as audio CAPTCHAs [9], observation-resistant passwords [2], and accessible password managers [3]. However, there is a gap in assessing the adequacy of non-visual information provided by browser security warnings.

When interfaces are not well designed for screen readers, visually impaired users may be forced to listen to irrelevant or incoherent content before finding the necessary information [12]. To compensate, screen reader users often speed up speech output and use shortcuts, which can lead to skipping important content and misinterpreting security and privacy while browsing [6]. Therefore, audible security information must be both accessible and comprehensible.

Felt et al. [7] propose guidelines for designing effective visual SSL dialogues, emphasizing that users must understand three dimensions of their security: 1) the nature of the threat, 2) the data at risk, and 3) the likelihood of the threat being real. Improved comprehension helps users make informed decisions rather than ignoring security warnings. We adapt Felt et al.'s criteria to assess whether the audible information from SSL dialogues can be understood and followed by visually impaired users.

## 3. Method
One author knowledgeable in both accessibility and usable security evaluated the SSL dialogues in Chrome and Firefox on desktop and mobile setups. For the desktop, we used Chrome 63.0 and Firefox 57.0 on Windows 10 with JAWS 18. For the mobile device, we used Chrome 63.0 and Firefox 10.4 on iOS 11.2 with the built-in VoiceOver screen reader.

We used Amazon (https://www.amazon.com) as a sample website with a valid SSL certificate, as SSL warnings are crucial for e-commerce sites where financial and personal information is exchanged. Conversely, we used a malicious website (http://www.validate.credit.card) to assess security warnings for sites without a certificate. This site displays security and bank logos to enhance phishing attempts, making security warnings critical for steering users away from such predatory sites.

We assessed each browser’s security dialogue interface on the two devices with the screen readers, keeping the screens on to observe discrepancies between visual and audible information. We formulated eight guiding questions per Felt et al.’s [7] three comprehension criteria (Table 2). During the evaluation, we noted issues and answered the guiding questions on a four-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). Inaccessible SSL dialogues were assigned a zero in all categories. Each dialogue was awarded a total score out of 32.

## 4. Results
Table 1 summarizes our assessment results. Overall, the audible information in most dialogues did not adhere to our evaluation criteria and poorly informed users about false positives (C3). Chrome and Firefox security dialogues disappeared when visiting the HTTP website on mobile, rendering SSL information totally inaccessible. The lack of security information is particularly problematic for visually impaired users who cannot rely on visual cues.

### C1. Threat Source
SSL warnings should identify threat sources related to the server, not the website, to help users assess the security of their internet connections. When accessible, both desktop and mobile versions of the browsers emphasized the secured nature of the connection, e.g., "Secure connection dialogue. To navigate use tab" on Chrome and "Secure connection. Show connection details" on Firefox. However, specific security information was often buried, leading to potential oversight by screen reader users.

### C2. Data Risk
Messages should describe at-risk data to inform users of what personal information is vulnerable. Most dialogues did not provide this information. Chrome, for example, mentioned that "Your information, for example, passwords or credit card numbers, is private when it is sent to this site" on HTTPS sites but failed to provide similar information on HTTP sites, leaving users unaware of the risks.

### C3. False Positives
No dialogues mentioned the concept of false positives. Both browsers’ dialogues on HTTPS sites included the name of the certificate’s issuer and its expiry date, which may help users assess the reputation of involved organizations. However, on HTTP sites, users were not given information to assess their circumstances or consider potential threats.

## 5. Discussion
Our initial results highlight four areas for future consideration in non-visual SSL design:
1. **Mobile Browsers:** SSL dialogues on mobile browsers do not provide enough information for users to comprehend potential threats, especially for visually impaired users limited to portions of the browser accessible through screen readers.
2. **Information Sequence:** SSL information should be more effectively communicated to screen reader users. A proposed sequence could be: 1) immediately identify the state of security, 2) provide relevant examples of data at risk, and 3) describe circumstances in which SSL attacks are likely.
3. **Early Communication:** Communicate the state of a connection early, without requiring the user to explore the SSL dialogue. For example, a chime indicating the presence or absence of SSL before hearing the page’s title, URL, and major headings.
4. **Security Terminology:** Differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate uses of security terminology, such as using different voices for browser dialogues and web page content.

### Conclusion
We conducted an expert evaluation of the accessibility of SSL dialogues through screen readers. Our results suggest that none of the SSL security dialogues were entirely accessible; when accessible, the information did not comprehensibly describe threat sources, at-risk data, or false positives. This lack of effective non-visual SSL information places visually impaired users at increased risk. We recommend that audible SSL information should be immediate, relevant, and clear. Future work will further assess non-visual SSL information and conduct usability studies with visually impaired users to improve security warnings.
