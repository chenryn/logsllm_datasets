ABSTRACT
Effective SSL warnings can point out network attacks or poten-
tial phishing sites. Much focus has been placed on tweaking text,
colours, and symbols to improve users’ comprehension and adhe-
sion. These optimized visualizations do not necessarily aid people
with visual disabilities who hear warnings rather than see them.
To assess the non-visual aspects of these security warnings, we
conducted an expert evaluation of Google Chrome and Mozilla
Firefox’s SSL certificate dialogues with JAWS and Apple VoiceOver
screen readers. Our findings suggest that warnings are mostly un-
readable with assistive technology and, when accessible, do not
effectively describe threat sources, at-risk data, or false positives.
Future work will explore the effectiveness of potential non-visual
redesigns through usability studies with visually impaired screen
reader users.

1 INTRODUCTION
Common security advice urges people to use websites with HTTPS
when sharing sensitive information online [10]. Early studies sug-
gested that users did not notice nor adhere to in-browser security
indicators [5]; however, more recent large-scale field studies have
suggested that effectively designed SSL warnings can significantly
deter users from potential danger [1].
In this study, we conduct an expert evaluation to explore whether
the audible outputs from a brower’s SSL warnings and dialogues
are comprehensible and effective in enabling screen reader users
to assess their online security. We evaluate the audible feedback

warnings for users who rely on screen reading software
2 BACKGROUND
Security warnings have been recognized as poorly accessible for
quite some time [8]. Despite this challenge and the fact that people
with visual impairments are increasingly reliant on the Internet
for tasks like online banking and social media, the accessibility of
security warnings has not been deeply explored.
Research that considers the accessibility of cybersecurity has
focused on better understanding visually impaired users’ general
security concerns and proposing novel accessibility solutions like
audio CAPTCHAS [9], observation-resistant passwords [2], and
accessible password managers [3]. But a gap exists in assessing the
adequacy of non-visual information currently provided by browser
security warnings.
When interfaces are not well designed for screen readers, users
with visual impairments are forced to listen to irrelevant or incoher-
ent aspects of a page before finding the content they require [12]. To
compensate, screen reader users typically speed up output speech
rates and use shortcuts to target sections they can understand and
think will progress their goals [4]. These habits have lead users to
skip important content and misinterpret their security and privacy
while browsing [6]. Therefore, audible security information for this
demographic must be accessible and comprehensible.
Felt et al. [7] propose guidelines for designing effective visual SSL
dialogues. They emphasize that for users to adhere to SSL warnings,
they must understand three dimensions of their security: 1) how
they are being threatened, 2) what is at risk, and 3) whether the
danger is real. Through improved comprehension, users can make
better informed decisions rather than ignore security warnings and
continue unsafe behaviours. We adapt Felt et al.’s three categories
of comprehension to assess whether the audible information being
offered from SSL dialogues can be understood and followed by
visually impaired users.
3 METHOD
One of the authors knowledgable in both accessibility and usable
security assessed the SSL dialogues in Chrome and Firefox on desk-
top and mobile setups. For the desktop, we used Chrome 63.0 and
Firefox 57.0 on a Windows 10 operating system with JAWS 18

screen reading software. For the mobile device, we used Chrome
63.0 and Firefox 10.4 on iOS 11.2 and used its built-in screen reading
software, VoiceOver.
We used Amazon (https://www.amazon.com) as a sample web-
site with a valid SSL certificate. SSL warnings when using eCom-
merce sites like Amazon are important when exchanging finan-
cial information and other personally identifiable information on-
line. Conversely, we used an evidently malicious website (http:
//www.validate.creditcard) to assess security warnings that may ap-
pear when visiting sites without a certificate. This website displays
security (Verisign) and bank logos to strengthen their phishing
attempts to collect credit card information from users. Security
warnings are critical to steering users away from such predatory
websites.
We assessed each browser’s security dialogue interface on the
two devices with the screen readers. We kept the devices’ screens
on during the evaluation to observe discrepancies between visual
and audible information. For our assessment, we formulated eight
guiding questions per Felt et al.’s [7] three comprehension criteria
(Table 2). While going through the interfaces, we took note of the
issues encountered and answered the guiding questions on a four-
point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly
agree (4). SSL dialogues that were inaccessible to the screen reader
were assigned a zero in all categories. Through this method, each
dialogue was awarded a total score out of 32.
4 RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes our assessment’s results. In brief, the audible
information in most dialogues did not adhere to our evaluation
criteria and most poorly informed users of false positives (C3).
Chrome and Firefox security dialogues disappeared when visiting
the HTTP website on mobile and thus SSL information was totally
inaccessible. The absence of SSL information would be problematic
for any user, but a lack of security information is a more severe

issue for visually impaired users who cannot compensate by using
other visual cues to assess their security.
As Felt et al. emphasize, information pertaining to each category
is critical to improving users’ comprehension of SSL security and
the potential for proper adhesion.
C1. Threat source. SSL warnings which identify threat sources
stemming from the server, rather than the website, enables users to
assess the security of their internet connections and make appro-
priate decisions in protecting themselves from data interception.
POSTER: Assessing Non-Visual SSL Certificates with
Desktop and Mobile Screen Readers
When accessible, both desktop and mobile versions of the browsers
emphasized the secured nature of the connection to a website, e.g.
“Secure connection dialogue. To navigate use tab,” on Chrome “Secure
connection. Show connection details.” on Firefox. This is intended to
tell the user whether the communication between the client and
the server is secure.
However, specific information pertaining to the connection’s
security was difficult to find; on desktop, it was tacked on to the
end of one run-on sentence listing the page’s URL, titles, and lock
icon alternative text. SSL information which is buried under generic
site information may be overlooked by screen reader users if they
choose to skip to the next section to avoid redundancy and manage
their cognitive load. Furthermore, mobile users have to tap through
the dialogue multiple times to reach the portion which includes
network security information. Users are unlikely to tap through
the entire dialogue unless they are suspicious of the website.
C2. Data risk. Messages describing at-risk data informs users
of what personal information is vulnerable and enables them to
consider the sensitivity of the information they share. Felt et al.
suggest that users should also be aware that data already on a site
can be vulnerable during an attack. Per our results, most dialogues
did not provide information identifying what data was at risk. On
desktop and mobile, Chrome provided examples of information that
is safe on a HTTPS site, e.g. “Your information for example passwords
or credit card numbers is private when it is sent to this site.” On a
HTTP website, no similar information was offered by Chrome’s
desktop and mobile dialogues. This fails to cue users to consider
the security and privacy of their data when it is most vulnerable.
C3. False Positives. The third SSL comprehension category,
false positives, pertains to warnings that may be incorrectly trig-
gered by things such as misconfigured SSL certificates. False posi-
tives can affect users’ confidence in security mechanisms. Therefore,
warning information should enable users to consider the context
of the warning to weigh the actuality of the threat.
No dialogues mentioned the concept of false positives. However,
both browsers’ dialogues on HTTPS sites included the name of the
certificate’s issuer and its expiry date which may enable users to
better assess the reputation of the involved organizations. Again,
when using HTTP websites, users were not given information to
assess their circumstances nor consider potential threats.
5 DISCUSSION
Our initial results point to four areas of non-visual SSL design for
future consideration. For one, especially on mobile browsers, SSL
dialogues do not provide enough information for users to com-
prehend potential threats. This is an issue for users, particularly
for those who are visually impaired and limited to portions of a
browser that are accessible through screen reading software. SSL
dialogues need to better describe potential threats, especially on
HTTP websites, textually and audibly.
Secondly, our results suggest defining SSL information to more
effectively communicate with screen reader users. Screen readers
communicate serially, and one optimized sequence of information
delivery may be: 1) immediately identify the state of security with-
out the need to enter the SSL dialogue, 2) provide relevant examples
CCS’18, October 2018, Toronto, Canada
of the types of data is safe/at risk, and 3) describe circumstances
in which SSL attacks are more likely to be imminent rather than
a false positive. User testing could assess the effectiveness of this
information sequence on visually impaired users’ comprehension
of security warnings.
Thirdly, to elaborate on the first piece of our proposed sequence,
it may be most effective to communicate the state of a connection
early on without requiring the user to explore the SSL dialogue. Like
a visual pop-up, implementing this well can be complicated. We
suggest methods which do not interfere with the user’s workflow
or mental load such as a chime indicating the presence or absence
of SSL before hearing the page’s title, URL, and major headings.
Furthermore, many words can denote safety to a user. Within
our evaluation, the word “validate” was included in the phishing
website’s title and URL. When reading SSL dialogues, there was
no audible differentiation between the browser’s use of the word
versus the site’s misuse of the word. Future studies may explore
methods of helping screen reader users comprehend differences
between legitimate and illegitimate uses of security terminology,
for example through different voices for browser dialogues and web
page content.
Conclusion. We conducted an expert evaluation of the accessi-
bility of SSL dialogues through the use of screen readers. Our results
suggest that none of the SSL security dialogues were entirely ac-
cessible; when accessible, the information did not comprehensibly
describe threat sources, at-risk data, nor false positives. This lack of
effective non-visual SSL information places visually impaired users’
at increased risk. We recommend audible SSL information should
be immediate, relevant, and clear. In the future, we will further
assess non-visual SSL information and conduct usability studies
with visually impaired users to explore how to improve security
warnings to meet their unique needs.
