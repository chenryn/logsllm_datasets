ABSTRACT
In this paper we provide a preliminary analysis of Google+
privacy. We identiﬁed that Google+ shares photo metadata
with users who can access the photograph and discuss its po-
tential impact on privacy. We also identiﬁed that Google+
encourages the provision of other names including maiden
name, which may help criminals performing identity theft.
We show that Facebook lists are a superset of Google+ cir-
cles, both functionally and logically, even though Google+
provides a better user interface. Finally we compare the
use of encryption and depth of privacy control in Google+
versus in Facebook.

INTRODUCTION
Google launched its latest social networking site Google+
on June 28th, 2011. According to comScore, an Internet
traﬃc watcher, Google+ registered 25 million users in its
ﬁrst 5 weeks [16], which motivates a close scrutiny. Cur-
rent leader of social networking market and the key rival
of Google+, Facebook, has over 750 million registered users
[14]. Facebook users share more than 30 billion pieces of
content (photos, videos, web links, notes, blog posts etc.)
every month.
Google+ like other social networks is used for sharing pri-
vate information including status updates, occupation, em-
ployment history, home and work addresses, contact num-
bers, relationship status, photos, videos, etc. As Google+’s
market penetration grows, so will the amount of data shared
by its users. With the enormous amount of data produced
on social networks, privacy is one of the issues widely dis-
cussed both in media and academia [3]. Considering the
importance of protection of the private information of its
users Google+ has introduced circles as a new concept to
address the issue.
Use of social networks has resulted in disclosure of embar-
rassing information, loss of employment, suspension from
school, and blackmail [4]. Social networks are also used for
social phishing attacks. Phishers harvest email addresses to
ﬁnd the real names and social network proﬁles of their vic-
tims [17]. This harvest is possible because both Google+
and Facebook require its users to use their real names and
allow search based on email addresses. Once the real names
and social network proﬁles are found, phishers extract more
information including people in the circles (or friend list) of
the victim, any comments, events attended etc. This infor-
mation is then used to craft personalized phishing attacks,
called social phishing [13]. Identity theft is costing US econ-
omy $15.6 billion a year [12]. Moreover, social network sta-
tus updates facilitated robberies on several occasions, where
the owner announced absence from their property for a cer-
tain duration [15]. Furthermore, the large amount of data is
also of interest to advertisers and marketers. According to
a survey by Social Media Examiner over 92% marketers use
social networks as a tool [18].
In view of the above discussion, it is very important and
timely to analyze Google+ and identify any privacy related
issues. This is the main goal of this paper.
Our contributions:
• We provide a preliminary analysis of privacy in Google+.
We identify that Google+ shares the metadata of photos
uploaded which could lead to privacy violations, discussed
in Section 2.1. Moreover, Google+ encourages its users to
provide their past addresses and other names e.g. maiden
name which could be used for identity theft. For further
details see Section 2.2.
• We compare Google+ circles (it’s main privacy selling
point) to Facebook lists. We show that, although Google+
circles have a better graphical user interface, they are log-
ically and functionally a subset of Facebook lists. Details
are provided in Section 2.3.
• We also make other comparisons between Facebook and
Google+ including the use of encryption and the ability
to disable comments and message sharing. Further details
are provided in Section 2.4

2. GOOGLE+ PRIVACY
In this section we present some privacy related problems
809Figure 2: Google+ Circles
Figure 1: Metadata from a photo by Larry Page on
Google+
and features of Google+. We also make a comparison with
Facebook, when applicable.
2.1 Google+’s photo metadata
When a user uploads a photo on Google+, some metadata
including the name of the photo owner, the date and time
the photo was taken, the make and model of the camera etc.
are made available to those with whom the photo is shared.
This set of information, in particular the date and time,
may at ﬁrst look relatively innocent and trivial, but could
in reality lead to some serious privacy concerns. On August
10, 2007, in Pennsylvania (USA), a divorce lawyer proved
the spouse of the client being unfaithful to his partner, when
the electronic toll records showed him in New Jersey (USA)
on that night and not in a business meeting in Pennsylvania
[9]. With the metadata revealed by Google+ a user might
leak enough information to be legally held liable on similar
accounts.
Similarly, the make of the camera could be another con-
cern for privacy. Higher end cameras cost thousands of dol-
lars. There have been past incidents where the victims were
killed for their cameras. In May 2011, a Greek citizen, 44,
was killed for his camera when taking his wife to the hospital
for child birth [19].
Just to give an example of the level of information a pic-
ture exposes about the camera, look at the metadata of the
publicly shared pictures (from his Google+ proﬁle) of Google
co-founder Larry Page, shown in Figure 1. It reveals that
they he used a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera to shoot his
vacation photographs. This camera is worth approximately
USD 2000. This gives the robber incentives.
2.2 Cities lived in and other names on proﬁle
In the “About” section of personal information, Google+
encourages its user to provide the names of cities the user
lived in and other names. In the text box for other names,
they write “For example: maiden name, alternative spelling”.
Figure 3: Share content with list“All” but hide from
list “CoWorkers” on Facebook
Messages, photos and comments on social networks and other
online sources can be used to infer family relationships. So,
if someone can link a proﬁle to the proﬁle of the mother and
if the mother provides the maiden name, then this could be
used for identity theft, as mother’s maiden name is one of
the most widely used secret question [5]. Moreover, the past
addresses can only help the attacker with such attacks.
2.3 Google+ circles vs Facebook lists
Paul Adams, then a Google employee, introduced the con-
cept of social circles [2]. These social circles act as the foun-
dation of circles in Google+. In Google+, by default there
are four circles: “friends”, “family”, “acquaintances” and “fol-
lowing”. We can remove/ rename any of the default circles
or add new circles. A user can add any of her contacts to
one or more circles just by a simple drag and drop. Fig-
ure 2 shows the graphical interface of Google+ circles. The
intersection of two or more circles can be a non-empty set.
A user can share the content of her choice with a speciﬁc
set of her circles, all her circles, her extended circles(people
in all her circles and all people in the circles of the people in
her circles) and with the public (everyone). Google+ does
not allow any exceptions, i.e. , if some content is shared with
a larger circle, there is no way to exclude any subset of that
circle. Anything shared with the public is shared with all
circles including the family and friends circle, which might
not be what the user may require.
Facebook on the other hand calls all the user’s connections
as “friends”. Friends could be divided into groups called
“lists”. There is no default list, so any structure has to be
created from scratch. Content on Facebook can be shared
with one or more lists, exactly like Google+ circles. But,
there is one diﬀerence that makes Facebook lists more ro-
bust than Google+ circles i.e. the possibility of making ex-
ceptions. In Facebook, we can limit access of our content
to a list which is a subsets of a set of lists with whom the
810content is shared. This means, we can share a message with
a list called “All” (containing all our contacts) and still make
the content invisibile to our “CoWorkers”, as shown in Figure
3.
As Facebook’s list creation was relatively cumbersome,
recently a Facebook application called “Circle Hack” [1] has
been launched which provides the Google+ circles graphical
interface for Facebook lists. The possibility and use of this
application further proves our claim that Facebook lists are
logically and functionally a superset of Google+ circles.
2.4 Google+ vs Facebook: other comparisons
Facebook uses an encrypted channel only for user authen-
tication (login) while Google+ uses it throughout the con-
nection. This makes it harder to launch a man in the mid-
dle attack against Google+. Moreover, Google+ allows ﬁner
control of the content shared by a user. A user can disable
comments on a post at any time and enable it again later.
This could be a useful option to calm down any heated dis-
cussions, on the users wall, between two contacts over the
shared content or anything else. Facebook, on the other
hand, provides its users only with coarser control i.e. they
can only block a user from the entire wall but not on an in-
dividual content basis (if it was initially shared with them).
Furthermore, Google+ allows disabling the resharing of a
content at any instant on a content by content basis, again
its not possible in Facebook. Finally, Google+ allows its
users to edit their comments whenever they want. The time
stamp of the last editing remains visible on a comment, so
users may modify or backtrack their comments at any time.
This too is not possible in Facebook.
3. RELATED WORK
Bradshaw identiﬁed the ﬁrst privacy ﬂaw in Google+ [7].
The ﬂaw was that any content shared with a particular cir-
cle could be reshared with anyone by someone from those
circles. Although resharing of information is always possi-
ble in the electronic world, if someone downloads a copy and
upload it again. But, the simplicity and provision of a share
button without proper authorization is a privacy problem.
This problem is now ﬁxed by Google+.
Social networks privacy and its potential threats have
been widely studied in recent years. One of the earliest
works on potential threats to individual’s privacy includ-
ing stalking, embarrassment and identity theft was done by
Gross et al. [11].
Felt [10] presented a vulnerability in Facebook Markup
Language which lead to session hijacking. Bonneau and
Dhingra independently presented conditional and limited
unauthorized access to Facebook photos [6, 8].
4. CONCLUSION
To conclude, we provided a preliminary analysis of Google+
privacy. We expressed concern that Google+ shares the
metadata of the photos uploaded by its users. We also
showed that Google+ encourages its users to provide their
other names, e.g. , maiden names which may help in iden-
tity theft. Moreover, we provided a comparison of Google+
circles with Facebook lists and showed that the latter is a
superset of the former, both logically and functionally even
though Google+ provides a better graphical interface. Fi-
nally, we provided other comparisons, including the use of
encryption and the possibility of modifying comments at a
later stage, between Facebook and Google+.
