### System Info
I'm running into an issue where I'm not able to load a 4-bit or 8-bit
quantized version of Falcon or LLaMa models. This was working a couple of
weeks ago. This is running on Colab. I'm wondering if anyone knows of a fix,
or why this is no longer working when it was 2-3 weeks ago around June 8th.
