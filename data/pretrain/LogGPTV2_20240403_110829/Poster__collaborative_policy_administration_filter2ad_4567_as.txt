### The Structure and Location of the Incubator

The municipality initially expressed a preference for a centrally located incubator with a traditional setup, employing a few key personnel such as business developers. However, during a workshop, this structure was challenged, and many participants favored a more distributed model. This model would be closer to social innovators like RGRA, HWA, and local city services, leveraging existing resources and distributing activities across different city districts.

### Post-Workshop Developments

Following the three workshops, we met with the civil servants responsible for the incubator process and the drafting of the memorandum and official report that would guide future city council decisions. These officials believed it would be difficult to gain support for a distributed model within the city council. They recognized, however, that a traditional central incubator would need to incorporate ideas and initiatives from city districts facing social challenges. They also emphasized the importance of considering the entire innovation chain, including the mobilization and support of existing grassroots resources.

During the meeting, these considerations led to a creative act of bureaucratic translation. The distributed incubator model, incorporating most of the workshop findings, was transformed into a new model consisting of two interconnected parts: a traditional incubator and a pre-incubator. The latter included most of the workshop's recommendations. The civil servants' skills enabled them to present a document that introduced something new and slightly radical while remaining within the bounds of what the city council would likely accept.

### Challenges and Setbacks

Despite the promise of this document, the "friendly hacking" approach did not fully penetrate the center of power. Subsequent actions, to which we had no access, took the process in a more conservative direction. First, some politicians failed to understand the concept of social innovation and requested its removal from the final policy-briefing note. Additionally, a new initiative from the local trade and industry, focused on growing existing companies, strongly advocated for a more traditional incubator aimed at creating new jobs. As a result, the final memorandum, which served as the basis for the political decision to invest in an incubator, excluded the concept of social innovation.

Although we had assembled a wide group representing all sectors, including civil servants and marginalized grassroots communities, a smaller, more powerful group, primarily from trade and industry and a few business and trade office civil servants, ultimately decided the type of incubator needed.

### Future Strategies

We lost the battle for radical change this time, but the process will continue on two tracks:

1. **Alliances with Other Researchers**: We will challenge the political consensus and hegemony at a meta-level, possibly through "unfriendly hacking." This track will explore how governance processes, where small informal networks make crucial decisions, can be extended to include more actors. Recent studies by political scientists have shown that while these networks are effective, they pose democratic and accountability issues, often excluding the third sector and representatives of underrepresented groups.

2. **Continued Friendly Hacking**: Despite the setbacks, several civil servants at different levels were disappointed with the process's development. The idea of the pre-incubator is not entirely dead and may continue in some form. In parallel, one of us worked with a municipal team exploring the use of design-inspired methods, which posed several challenges, including the re-formulation of design vocabulary to better fit the municipal culture.

### Implications for Design Practice

Our work has been crucial in seeing the heterogeneous city as a design lab for exploring alternative futures. We facilitate and trigger creative communities, connecting them to established top-down actors. While we have made strategic design decisions, most of our efforts have been in navigating among stakeholders and opportunities, focusing on different levels of design engagement. Our role as a design school and public body allows us to tackle hard cases, think long-term, and build trust between diverse stakeholders.

### Implications for Design Education

The Malmö DESIS lab requires close collaboration between researchers, tutors, and students. We aim for flexible curriculums to accommodate changing circumstances and emerging opportunities. Interaction design students are well-suited for some lab activities, but "friendly hacking" demands additional skills and a long-term commitment. We are exploring the possibility of offering design courses to other disciplines, such as urban studies, to provide design perspectives and training for future civil servants.

### Implications for Policymaking

Policy work has become increasingly important as the lab has matured. Our strategy to influence innovation policy within the public sector includes building alliances with other research disciplines and key civil servants. The lab serves as a platform for mutual learning, integrating design practices and methods into the public sector. We have learned that design practice cannot be imposed but must respect other professional disciplines.
