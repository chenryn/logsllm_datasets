the basic structure and the location of the incubator. 
The municipality had stated that they preferred a 
centrally located incubator with a more traditional set-
up with some few people employed (such as business 
developers). During the workshop that structure was 
contested and many participants favored a more 
distributed model, closer to social innovators such as 
RGRA, HWA and local city services, hence, building on 
already existing resources and locating activities out 
in the different city districts.
After the three workshops, we had a meeting with the 
civil servant responsible for the incubator process 
and the civil servant responsible for writing the 
memorandum and official report that would be the 
basis for further decisions in the city council.  These 
civil servants thought it would be hard to gain 
support for a distributed incubator model in the city 
council. However, they realized that a traditional 
central incubator would need ideas and initiatives 
coming from the city districts with social problems 
and that it was important to consider the whole chain 
of innovation, including mobilizing and supporting 
existing grassroots resources. During the meeting 
these considerations opened up for a creative act of 
bureaucratic translation. The distributed incubator 
model (including most of the findings from the 
workshop) was transformed into a new model 
consisting of two interconnected parts: a traditional 
incubator and a pre-incubator (where the latter 
contained most of the findings from the workshop). 
The skills of the bureaucratic civil servants made it 
possible to translate the workshop findings into a 
document that presented something new (and slightly 
radical) and that was still within in the safe zone for 
being accepted by the city council.
Although this document seemed promising, what 
happened next was that the friendly hacking approach 
didn’t manage to hack all the way into the center of 
power. During the actions that followed (and to which 
we didn’t get access) two things happened that took 
the process into a much more conservative direction. 
First, some politicians didn’t understand the concept 
of social innovation and therefore requested that 
everything related to it should be removed from the 
final policy-briefing note. The other thing was that a 
new initiative from the local trade and industry that 
focused on growing existing 
companies, had 
strong ideas 
82
about what the incubator should be (a more traditional 
incubator that focus on creating new jobs). In the 
final memorandum that was the base for the political 
decision to invest in an incubator the concept of social 
innovation was gone. Although we had assembled a 
wide group representing all sectors including civil 
servants and creative but marginalized grass root 
communities. A much smaller group representing 
powerful stakeholders within trade and industry and a 
few civil servants within the business and trade office 
got to decide what kind of incubator that was needed.
We lost the battle of reaching radical change this 
time. However, the process will continue in two tracks; 
through alliances with other researchers where we will 
try to challenge the political consensus and hegemony 
on a Meta level (might be through unfriendly 
hacking). In this track we will explore how this kind of 
political governance processes where small informal 
network (that stretch between the public and private 
sectors and makes crucial political decisions) could 
be extended to include many more actors. Political 
scientists have recently been studying the established 
governance networks in Malmö and revealed that 
they have the ability to act and get things done, but 
they pose implications for democracy as well as the 
issue of accountability [12]. This seems to be a general 
dilemma in governance processes where some always 
will be excluded from the informal networks [36] and 
most often involves trade and industry but not “the 
third sector or representatives of people with low 
participation in elections” [34, p. 31].
The other track will continue as a friendly hacking 
approach though it turned out that several civil 
servants on different levels where disappointed with 
how the process developed and it seems like the ideas 
of the pre-incubator is not completely 
dead and will continue in some forms. 
In parallel to this process and highly 
related to the pre-incubator, one of 
us did some crucial work embedded 
in a municipal team that explored 
how the municipality could 
work with design 
inspired methods. 
This turned out 
to pose several 
challenges; 
one of them 
83
regarded the design vocabulary, which provoked 
many civil servants. A serious effort where therefore 
made to re-formulate this vocabulary so it would 
fit the municipal language and culture better by 
using phrases such as: The empathic perspective! 
Collaborative problem formulation! Test early and test 
again! 
2.3 Third set of reflections – Challenge those who feed you
Another strategy to reach impact is to be able to 
challenge financing bodies (that very much control 
and steer what we can do). One of the funding bodies 
of our activities is the Swedish Agency for Economic 
and Regional Growth that channel money from EU 
structural funds to regional development projects. 
The larger project Malmö Nya Medier (in which we 
are a smaller part) have very distinct project goals 
and indicators such as supporting regional growth 
and creating a specific number of new jobs and new 
companies. This has some implications for us because 
we also want to challenge and discuss the concept of 
growth, something that many of our project activities 
also elaborates. This have also been brought up by the 
external evaluator of the project, who has criticized 
some of our actions and arguing that our focus should 
be more directly targeted towards activities leading 
to commercial business. Luckily for us we found an 
allied in a group of researchers that had been assigned 
by the same financing body (the Swedish Agency 
for Economic and Regional Growth) to do a Meta 
level study on different projects financed by them. 
During their study they could connect the rationale 
behind the call to a larger context of European 
policies regarding social cohesion and the connection 
between integration and growth. According to them 
Malmö Living Lab had achieved to establish new 
forms of collaboration, utilized unused competences, 
empowered people and connected stakeholders 
in forms that potentially could become 
role models in the future. “Here they have 
succeeded in something many regard as 
impossible, but its not assigned any value” 
[35 p.49]. They conclude that the problem 
is not how MLL operates but rather how 
the labs are measured and evaluated 
in a to short perspective with to limited 
indicators. We still don’t know the impact of 
this, but hopefully it can open up more opportunities 
for how we can operate in the future.
2.4 Final set of reflections – Agonism is here, be ready!
The need for a long term agonistic public platform 
became urgent recently (late 2012) when the 
coordinator of RGRA Behrang Miri with whom we 
have collaborated in several projects (see illustrated 
boxes ) moved a bunch of Tintin comic magazines 
some few meters from the children section to the 
adult section at Stockholms Kulturhus where he had a 
part time job as responsible for artistic development 
among youngsters. He moved them because he 
believed they depicted Arab and African people in 
a very stereotypical way. When public media wrote 
about it was re-framed as cleaning out Tintin from 
the library and the media chaos didn’t wait. New 
media platforms such as Twitter pushed a shallow and 
How to do this is a truly agonistic issue where people 
never will agree. Still the format of twitter allowing 
extremely short (not deepened) messages spurred a 
public hegemony ruled by the Swedish middle class. 
Being abroad when this happened we couldn’t avoid 
the media storm and we acted quickly and sent a 
mail to Behrang Miri offering a suggestion to take the 
opportunity and establish an agonistic platform where 
a constructive debate could be played out.  New media 
doesn’t have to be shallow. Re-mix and mashup culture 
could provide tools for young people to play with and 
reconstruct national identities. So the final lesson 
would be; agonism is here, be prepared and build up 
the ability to act on unexpected opportunities!

And as the journalist Rakel Chukri 
reflected: “The core question 
is still there: how to represent 
different nationalities and non-
white people in the cultural 
sphere?” How to do this is a truly 
agonistic issue where people 
never will agree. 
unreflective debate that mainly criticized Behrangs 
initiative. The books where moved back and Behrang 
took a long term brake and then resigned. Media 
researcher Rasmus Fleischer stated that: “After a few 
hours critique through Twitter the head of Kulturhuset 
claimed that they decided to move back the Tintin 
books. Who had the opportunity to participate in the 
debate? The minority that can spend an afternoon 
with Twitter and make most noise”(19). What Behrang 
tried to do was the same as many had been doing 
e.g. in Brooklyn Public Library (38), to move the Tintin 
books from the children to the adult section. More 
and more people gave Behrang support and citing 
Rasmus Flaisher again: “when the longer in-depth 
Blogg posts were published the critique cycle was 
finished and the debate closed. The pundits on twitter 
where looking for the next issue” (19). And as the 
journalist Rakel Chukri reflected: ”The core question 
is still there: how to represent different nationalities 
and non-white people in the cultural sphere?”(10)

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
Crucial for us has been to see the heterogeneous city as the design lab from which 
we can explore alternative futures. In this lab we facilitates and trigger creative 
communities, but we also connect them to other more established top-down actors. 
Although we have made some few strategic design decisions (such as working 
explicitly with an inclusive approach) most of our work have been spent on ruff 
patchwork to make things grow bottom up and allowing serendipity to happen. 
Instead of following pre-defined plans we have been navigating among the 
stakeholders and opportunities that we have encountered. This has brought our 
focus to very different levels of design engagement, sometimes we have zoomed in 
and paid attention to the details of an experiment and when we have realized that 
the potential results have been blocked we have zoomed out again to elaborate and 
possible change the bigger picture. In this process of ‘friendly hacking’ we have tried 
to re-design and ‘move the walls’ in our design lab to create more room for maneuver 
and overcome obstacles that might limit the impact of our actions. Finally, being a 
design school and a public body, means we can pick the hard cases (where you might 
end up without a success story) and have to live with uncertainty. It also gives us the 
possibility to think long-term collaborations where we build trust between diverse 
stakeholders, rather than short projects with very tight deadlines. Another specific 
opportunity we as a university have, is to see the design practice, not only as an 
approach from which you can create new solutions, but also as an agonistic platform 
from which you can explore issues, produce knowledge and allow controversies to 
reside side by side.
DESIGN EDUCATION
The Malmö DESIS lab demands a very close collaboration between, researchers/
tutors and students, (PhD, Master and undergraduate students). The researchers/
tutors provide the cases and the setting from the networks of the living labs and 
do (most) of the matchmaking between stakeholders. Matching the curriculum with 
external cases and research projects demands a lot of work and makes the student 
assignment/brief very complex. Sometimes we have had to remake the brief entirely 
in the last minute when outside circumstances have changed or new opportunities 
have emerged. Therefore we aim for curriculums that allow a lot of flexibility. The 
majority of students and courses related to the lab are situated within the field of 
interaction design. This means that some of the lab activities are more relevant 
and achievable for the students (such as setting up small-scale experiments). Doing 
‘friendly hacking’ demands other kinds of skills beyond what we can demand from 
interaction design student and it’s also a long-term process that goes beyond 
individual courses or terms. One exiting opportunity we have discussed (and started 
with in small scale) is to offer design courses and lectures to other disciplines 
outside the design school e.g. within urban studies where more typically future 
civil servants might study. Such an approach would open up for long term friendly 
hacking by providing design perspectives and training for people that later will 
become embedded within public organizations.
85
POLICYMAKING
Policy work has become increasingly important when the lab has matured. All our 
‘friendly hacking’ activities has been attempts to open up and widening the capacity 
of the lab and to spread design approaches into the public sector. Our experiences 
is that being part of a design school and being design researchers gives us a weak 
position compared to other disciplines when it comes to influencing innovation 
policy within the public sector. To gain a stronger position our strategy has been to 
build alliances with other research disciplines and with key civil servants within the 
municipality. From this the lab can become a platform for mutual learning where 
experiences and methods from the design practice, in a modest and bottom up way, 
can influence and become integrated in the public sector and where we as designers 
also can learn from others. We strongly believe that the design practice can make 
a difference and contribute to social innovation. However, we have also learned 
that you cant impose a design practice into a new sector, rather you have to respect 
other professional disciplines. Although many civil servants are eager to learn 
new methods and approaches and willingly collaborate with us, others have been 
skeptical towards what design and design researchers could bring to their everyday 
work. One example described in this article was that we had to re-formulate typical 
design terms in forms that could be accepted within the municipality.
