User: I have Python 2.7.5 running on OS X 10.9.2. 
I downloaded the Python installer "python-3.4.0-macosx10.6.dmg" from python.org. 
After the installation, I still get 2.7.5 when querying python -V.
I am not sure what I need to do to replace 2.7.5 with 3.4 besides installing python-3.4.0-macosx10.6.dmg.
Assistant: I simply replaced the executable link in my IDE from "/usr/bin/python" to "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin".
