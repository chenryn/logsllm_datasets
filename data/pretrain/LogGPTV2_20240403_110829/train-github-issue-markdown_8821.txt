### Analysis and Recommendations

The error message indicates a **duplicate class** issue, specifically with the `android.arch.core.util.Function` class. This is likely due to conflicting versions of dependencies in your project.

#### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Check Your Dependencies:**
   - Open your `build.gradle` file and review the dependencies listed there.
   - Ensure that you do not have multiple versions of the same library, especially those related to Android Architecture Components.

2. **Exclude Conflicting Dependencies:**
   - You can exclude specific transitive dependencies from a dependency tree. For example, if `Firestore` is bringing in a version of `android.arch.core`, you can exclude it:
     ```gradle
     implementation('com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore') {
         exclude group: 'android.arch.core', module: 'common'
     }
     ```

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all your dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with each other. Sometimes, updating to the latest version of a library can resolve conflicts.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   - After making changes, clean and rebuild your project to ensure that all changes are applied:
     ```sh
     flutter clean
     flutter pub get
     flutter run
     ```

5. **Check for Known Issues:**
   - Refer to the [Firebase Firestore documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and the [Flutter Firestore plugin documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore) for any known issues or additional configuration steps.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the duplicate class issue and successfully compile your Android app.
