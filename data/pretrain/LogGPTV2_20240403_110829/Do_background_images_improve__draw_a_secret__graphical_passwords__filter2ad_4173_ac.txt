a 
their 
confirmation within half minute. However, since it usually takes 
much  more  time  to  either  create  or  memorise  a  DAS  password 
than  a  textual  one,  and  since  people  were  not  so  familiar  with 
graphical passwords, we have assumed that on average the users 
repeat the password for confirmation after a longer period. 
Table  2  compares  the  successful  recalls  in  each  group  (Each 
participant was allowed three attempts). The recall success rate in 
the BDAS group was the same as in the DAS group. This appears 
to  suggest  that  when  a  background  image  was  available,  people 
would at least perform the same in their password confirmation as 
in the original scheme, maintaining a smooth process of password 
setting.

Table 3 compares the complexity of secrets that were successfully 
recalled  in  two  groups.  Those  secrets  in  the  BDAS  group  on 
average  did  contain  more  complexity.  A  t-test  yields  a  result  of 
t=2.948, p < .01 (one tail), indicating that the passwords that were 
successfully recalled in the BDAS group were significantly longer 
than  those  in  the  DAS  group.  Furthermore,  only  37.5%  (3/8)  of 
recalled  secrets  in  the  BDAS  group  had  global  symmetry, 
compared to 100% (8/8) in the DAS group; 50% of (4/8) recalled 
secrets in the BDAS group were centered, compared to 87.5% (7/8) 
in the DAS group.

Estimated  with  Table  2  in  the  extended  version  of  [13],  the 
average strength of memorable passwords in the DAS group was 
between 48.7 and 50.9 bits in this recall test, less secure than that 
could be achieved by 8-character textual passwords (about 53 bits). 
On the contrary, the average strength of memorable passwords in 
the  BDAS  group  was  larger  than  61.8  bits1.  Therefore,  although 
the BDAS scheme did not significantly increase the average stroke 
count,  it  significantly  increased  the  security  of  memorable 
passwords  by  increasing  the  password  length,  and  the  effective 
password  space  for  memorable  BDAS  passwords  was  increased 
by a factor of more than 1024. 
5.4.4 Recall â€“ A Week Later 
One week later, each participant was asked to recall their secret. 
Each participant was allowed three attempts. Unfortunately not all 
the participants were available as some were in other parts of the 
country and Europe at the time. Among 8 valid responses in the 
BDAS  group  and  7  in  the  DAS  group,  four  secrets  were 
successfully  recalled  in  each  group.  These  secrets  were  also 
successfully  recreated  in  the earlier  5-minute  recall  test.  Table 4 
below  shows  that  the  recall  success  rate  was  higher  without  the 
background images. However, it is useful to note that in practical 
terms,  this  was  only  a  difference  of  one  incorrect  response,  and 
due to low subject numbers, must be treated with caution.

Table 5 puts this into perspective by comparing the complexity of

On  average,  the  secrets  recalled  with  the  background  images 
showed much more complexity in terms of both stroke count and 
password length than those without. Furthermore, only 50% (2/4) 
of  recalled  secrets  in  the  BDAS  group  had  global  symmetry, 
compared to 100% (4/4) in the DAS group; 25% of (1/4) recalled 
secrets in the BDAS group were centered, compared to 100% (4/4) 
in the DAS group. 
In this recall test, the average strength of memorable passwords in 
the DAS group was less than 41.9 bits (estimated with avg. stroke 
count = 2.25 and avg. password length = 14.5), less secure than 
could  be  achieved  by  8-character  textual  passwords.  On  the 
contrary,  the  average  strength  of  memorable  passwords  in  the 
BDAS group was larger than 61.8 bits (estimated with avg. stroke 
count  =  5.75  and  avg.  password  length  =  20.25).  Therefore,  it 
appears  that  the  BDAS  scheme  also  significantly  increased  the 
security  of  memorable  passwords  by  increasing  the  password 
length in longer term. 
It is worthwhile to note that previous research assumed, based on 
psychology  studies,  that  users  would  struggle  to  set  secrets 
containing  greater  than  4  strokes  [12].  Our  recall  results  in  the 
DAS  group  appeared  to  confirm  this  assumption.  The  average 
stroke  count  of  secrets  that  were  successfully  recalled  is  merely 
2.25,  and  the  maximum  stroke  count  3.  On  the  contrary,  the 
average stroke count of the secrets that were successfully recalled 
in the BDAS group is 5.75, with the maximum stroke count being 
8.

In  Table  6  we  also  compare  the  complexity  of  secrets  that  the 
participants failed to recall in the two groups. It is not surprising 
that  on  average,  those  secrets  in  the  BDAS  group  were  more 
complicated  than  those  in  the  DAS  group,  in  terms  of  both  the 
stroke count and the password length.  
By  examining  Tables  5  and  6,  two  interesting  patterns  can  be 
observed. First, secrets that were not successfully recalled in the 
DAS group had a much larger average stroke count (4.67 vs. 2.25) 
and  a  much  higher  password  length  (24.67  vs.  14.5)  than  those 
that  were  successfully  recalled.  Second,  secrets 
that  were 
successfully  recalled  in  the  BDAS  group  had  a  slightly  higher 
average  stroke  count  (5.75  vs.  5.25)  but  a  much  lower  average 
password  length  (20.25  vs.  27.75)  than  those  that  were  not 
successfully recalled. 
Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that, unlike the DAS group, 
those who had the aid of the background image (including those 
who could not repeat their drawing successfully) all started from 
the  correct  cell.  Each  of  them  put  this  down  to  the  aid  of  the 
background image.  
the 
image, 
5.5 Interpretation of Study 1 Results  
With  the  aid  of  a  background  image,  people  tended  to  construct 
more  complicated  passwords  (e.g.  with  a  larger  length  or  stroke 
count) than their counterparts using DAS. The background image 
appears  also  to  reduce  other  predictable  characteristics  such  as 
global symmetry and centering within the drawing grid that led to 
weak DAS passwords. A possible explanation is that DAS users 
employed  centering  and  symmetry  --  natural  techniques  of 
drawing -- as ways to help remember their secrets;  BDAS users 
however had more options of placement and shape as they could 
use  features  of 
the  predictable 
characteristics seen in DAS secrets.  
There was also evidence that the background image improved the 
memorability  of  passwords.  For  example,  no  short-term 
detrimental memory effect was observed for using more complex 
passwords  encouraged  by  background  images.  However,  the 
question of whether the background image in the longer run helps 
the  users  remember  the  password  better  than  the  original  DAS 
scheme does is more difficult to answer. No definite trends were 
encountered  that  suggested  either  way,  although  the  users  were 
more  likely  to  remember  their  starting  cell  with  the  aid  of  the 
background images. In our view, this is largely due to the limited 
number of responses we received in the experiment, and a larger 
scale empirical study will give a clear answer.  
thus  reducing 
6. USER STUDY 2 
Results from our first study were very encouraging. However, the 
number of responses we received in the 1-week recall test was not 
large  enough  to  do  meaningful  statistical  tests.  Therefore,  we 
decided  we  run  a  second  experiment  on  a  larger  scale.  In  this 
experiment,  transparency  was  introduced  to  the  DAS  group  as 
well, and a video camera was used to capture the drawing process 
of  each  participant,  but  everything  else  (including  experiment 
stationery, procedure and background images) remained the same 
as in the first study.  
We recruited 46 participants for this study, 32 male and 14 female. 
All the participants were undergraduate students at the time of the 
experiment, but none of them had previously used DAS or BDAS 
passwords.  The  typical  age  range  of  subjects  was  18-25  with  1

backgrounds (majoring in computer science, engineering and etc.),

follows.

Figure 7 summarises the distribution of background image choices 
in the BDAS group. The playing card was still the most popular 
image,  and  was  selected  33%  of  the  time.  This  was  closely 
followed by the plant image with 30% of selections. The map and 
crowd images were the least popular choices.
