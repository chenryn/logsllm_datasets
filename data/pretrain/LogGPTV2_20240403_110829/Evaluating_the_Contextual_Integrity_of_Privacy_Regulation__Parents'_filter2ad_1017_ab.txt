### Unrealistic Information Flows in the CI Survey Method

Unrealistic information flows are a core component of the Contextual Integrity (CI) survey method [3], aimed at reducing the total number of questions and the corresponding cost of running the survey. This process resulted in 1,056 total information flow descriptions for use in CI survey questions (Section 3.2).

The degree to which these flows are rated as acceptable or unacceptable by survey respondents indicates the level of agreement or disagreement between COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and parents' privacy norms. The following sections detail how we selected values for each information flow parameter.

#### Transmission Principles from COPPA

We used the Federal Trade Commission’s Six Step Compliance Plan for COPPA [10] to identify transmission principles. Some of these principles align with those in our previous work [3], facilitating comparison of results.

- **Steps 2–4**: We converted steps 2–4 of the Compliance Plan into four transmission principles regarding consent, notification, and privacy policy compliance (Table 1). COPPA mandates that parents must receive direct notice and provide verifiable consent before any information about children is collected. Operators covered by COPPA must also post a privacy policy that describes what information will be collected and how it will be used. Our corresponding transmission principles allow us to test whether these requirements increase the acceptability of data collection from and about children.
  
- **Step 5**: This step concerns "parents’ ongoing rights with respect to personal information collected from their kids" [10]. Operators must allow parents to review, revoke consent, or delete collected information. We translated this requirement into the transmission principle: "if its owner can at any time revoke their consent, review, or delete the information collected."

- **Step 6**: This step addresses operators’ responsibility to implement "reasonable procedures to protect the security of kids’ personal information" [10] and to only release children’s information to third-party service providers who can do likewise. We translated this step into five transmission principles involving confidentiality, security, storage, and deletion practices (Table 1).

- **Exclusions**: The Compliance Plan lists exclusions to COPPA. We converted the most applicable exclusions for Internet-connected children’s devices into four transmission principles (Table 1). We also added the transmission principle "if it complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule" to test parents’ trust and awareness of COPPA itself.

- **Null Transmission Principle**: We included a null transmission principle to create control information flows with no COPPA-based criteria. Comparing the acceptability of flows with the null transmission principle against equivalent flows with COPPA-based transmission principles allows us to determine whether COPPA conditions are relevant to parents’ privacy norms.

#### Smart Toy Senders

The senders in our survey represent five categories of children’s IoT devices: smart speakers/baby monitors, smart watches, toy walkie-talkies, smart dolls, and toy robots. These senders were chosen based on recent press articles [13, 17, 20, 29, 31, 35], academic papers [5, 25], blogs [9, 19, 37], IoT-specific websites [21, 23, 38], and merchants such as Toys “R” Us and Amazon. All selected senders are devices reasonably "directed towards children" [10, 11] to ensure they are covered by COPPA. Devices like smart thermometers or other smart home devices that might collect information about children but are not directly targeted at children were excluded.

It is important to note that the selected devices do not represent the full breadth of smart toy products. However, information flow descriptions involving specific devices evoke more varied privacy norms from survey respondents than generic "smart toy" descriptions. This is supported by existing interview data [58], noting that IoT device owners often have different privacy opinions of specific entities than their generic exemplars (e.g., "Seattle government" versus "government").

#### Information Attributes

We reviewed academic research [25], online privacy websites [38], toy descriptions [15], and privacy policies [18, 36] to compile a list of information attributes collected by the toys in our sender list. The final selected attributes include heart rate, frequently asked questions, times the subject is home, frequently traveled routes, times the device is used, location, sleeping habits, call history, audio of the subject, emergency contacts, video of the subject, and birthday. These attributes cover a variety of personally identifiable or sensitive information with specific handling practices mandated by COPPA.

#### First- and Third-party Recipients

We included device manufacturers and third-party service providers as recipient parameters. This allowed us to examine variations in privacy between first and third parties while limiting the total number of information flows and the corresponding cost of running the survey.

#### Children as Information Subjects

The only subject parameter included in the survey is "its owner’s child." This wording emphasizes that the child is not the owner of the device and acknowledges the parental role in ensuring children’s privacy. It also accounts for devices that may not be used directly or exclusively by the child (e.g., a baby monitor). We instructed respondents to think about their own children’s information when interpreting this subject.

### Table 1: Contextual Integrity Parameter Values

|--------|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| a smart speaker/baby monitor | its manufacturer | its owner’s child’s heart rate | COPPA Compliance Plan Steps 2-3 |
| a smart watch | a third-party service provider | its owner’s child’s frequently asked questions | if its privacy policy permits it |
| a toy walkie-talkie | | the times its owner’s child is home | if its owner is directly notified before the information was collected |
| a smart doll | | its owner’s child’s frequently traveled routes | COPPA Compliance Plan Step 4 |

### 3.2 Survey Design

We created and hosted the survey on the Qualtrics platform [39]. The survey was split into six sections: consent, demographic questions I, overview, contextual integrity questions, awareness questions, and demographic questions II. This section provides details about each section. The survey did not mention COPPA, privacy, security, nor any potential negative effects of smart toy information flows prior to the contextual integrity questions to prevent priming and framing effects.

- **Consent**: Respondents were initially presented with a consent form approved by our university’s Institutional Review Board. Those who did not consent were not allowed to proceed with the study.

- **Demographic Questions I**: The first set of demographic questions asked respondents for the ages of their children under 13. We chose this age limit because COPPA only applies to data collection from children under 13. We randomly selected one of the ages for each respondent, n, which was piped to the survey overview.

- **Overview**: Respondents were then presented with a survey overview containing a brief description of Internet-connected devices and instructions for the contextual integrity questions (Appendix A). This overview also explained how respondents should interpret the recurring phrase "its owner’s child," and instructed them to keep their n-year-old child in mind while taking the survey (where n was selected for each respondent from their responses to the demographics questions I).

- **Contextual Integrity Questions**: The core of the survey consisted of 32 blocks of questions querying the acceptability of our generated information flows (Section 3.1). Each question block contained 33 information flows with the same sender, same attribute, varying recipients, and varying transmission principles. For example, one block contained all information flows with the sender "a smart doll" and the attribute "the times it is used." Each question block also included one attention check question.

  - **Question Block Assignment**: Each respondent was randomly assigned to a single question block. Answering questions about flows with the same sender and attribute reduced cognitive fatigue and ensured independence across recipients and transmission principles.
  
  - **Matrix Format**: The information flows in each block were divided into matrices of individual Likert scale multiple choice questions. The first matrix in each block contained questions about information flows to different recipients with the null transmission principle (Figure 1). The remaining matrices each contained questions about information flows to a specific recipient with varying transmission principles (Figure 2). The order of the information flows in each block was randomized for each respondent.
  
  - **Likert Scale**: Each individual multiple choice question in the matrices asked respondents to rate the acceptability of a single information flow on a scale of five Likert items: Completely Acceptable (2), Somewhat Acceptable (1), Neutral (0), Somewhat Unacceptable (-1), Completely Unacceptable (-2). We also included the option "Doesn’t Make Sense" to allow respondents to indicate if they didn’t understand the information flow.

- **Awareness Questions**: Respondents then answered questions about their general technological familiarity and Internet use, ownership of Internet-connected devices, ownership of children’s Internet-connected devices, and previous knowledge of COPPA.

- **Demographic Questions II**: Finally, respondents answered standard demographic questions from the United States Census. This allowed us to check the representativeness of our sample (Appendix B, Section 5.2) and account for demographic variables in our analysis.

### 3.3 Survey Deployment

We tested the survey on UserBob [52] once during the survey design process and again immediately prior to deployment. UserBob is a usability testing service for obtaining video screen capture of users interacting with a website while recording audio feedback. Each survey test involved creating a UserBob task with a link to the survey, brief instructions for users, and settings to recruit 4 users to take the survey for 7 minutes each. UserBob automatically recruited users through Amazon Mechanical Turk at a cost of $1 per user per minute. The resulting video and audio recordings of users interacting with the survey informed changes to our survey design. Specifically, we reduced the number of questions per block and increased the number of pages over which the questions were presented. This practice of using pre-deployment "cognitive interviews" to test and debug survey design is common in survey research [49]. UserBob responses were not included in the final results.

We used Cint [8], an insights exchange platform, to deploy our survey to a panel of 296 adult parents of children under the age of 13 in the United States. We selected respondents with children younger than 13 because COPPA applies to "operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13" [11]. Our surveyed population therefore consisted entirely of individuals affected by COPPA. We chose not to set a minimum age for respondents’ children due to a lack of readily available information on the minimum age of use of Internet-connected children’s devices. While some manufacturers list recommended minimum ages for their connected toys and devices, this was not the case for the majority of the devices we considered. Additionally, many devices such as wearable trackers, water bottles, and baby monitors are targeted towards very young children. Not restricting the minimum age allowed us to relax the demographic requirements for survey deployment.

Respondents were paid $3 for valid responses where the attention check question was answered correctly. Each respondent was only allowed to answer the survey once. The survey responses were collected over an 18-hour time frame. We chose Cint to deploy our survey instead of Amazon Mechanical Turk because Cint allowed us to directly target a specific panel of respondents (as in Zyskowski et al. [60]) without requiring a preliminary screening questionnaire to identify parents [44].

### 3.4 Response Analysis

We began with 296 responses. We removed the responses from 8 respondents who did not consent to the survey (none of their information was recorded) and those from 85 respondents who did not correctly answer the attention check question. We also removed 2 responses in which over 50% of the information flows were characterized as "Doesn’t make sense," 2 responses where not all information flow questions were answered, 1 response where the respondent self-reported over 10 children, and 3 responses that were completed in less than 2 minutes. This resulted in a final set of 195 responses with an average of 6 responses per information flow (standard deviation 1.4).

The responses to all contextual integrity questions (Section 3.2) were on a Likert scale with the following Likert items: "Completely acceptable" (2), "Somewhat acceptable" (1), "Neutral" (0), "Somewhat unacceptable" (-1), and "Completely unacceptable" (-2). We call this value the "acceptability score" of each information flow for each respondent.

To generalize privacy norms beyond individual respondents and information flows, we averaged the acceptability scores.
