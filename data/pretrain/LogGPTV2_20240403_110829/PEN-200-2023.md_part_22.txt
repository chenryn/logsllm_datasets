### OS Fingerprinting with Nmap

The following operating systems were identified with a high probability (87-88%):
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016
- Microsoft Windows 7
- Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium SP1
- Microsoft Windows 7 Professional

No exact OS matches were found for the host. If you know the OS running on the host, you can submit it to [nmap.org/submit](https://nmap.org/submit/).

#### Example: Using nmap for OS Fingerprinting

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sT -A 192.168.50.14
```

**Nmap Scan Report for 192.168.50.14**
- Host is up (0.12s latency).
- Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)

**Port State Service Version**
- 21/tcp open ftp?
  - FileZilla Server 1.2.0
- 135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC
- 139/tcp open netbios-ssn Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
- 445/tcp open microsoft-ds?

**Nmap Done:** 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 55.67 seconds.

The response suggests that the underlying operating system of this target is likely one of the following: Windows 2008 R2, 2012, 2016, Vista, or Windows 7.

### Note on OS Fingerprinting Accuracy

OS fingerprinting is not always 100% accurate, often due to network devices like firewalls or proxies that rewrite packet headers during communication.

### Banner Grabbing and Service Enumeration

Once the underlying operating system is recognized, we can identify services running on specific ports by inspecting service banners using the `-A` parameter, which also runs various OS and service enumeration scripts against the target.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nmap -sT -A 192.168.50.14
```

**Nmap Scan Report for 192.168.50.14**
- Host is up (0.12s latency).
- Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)

**Port State Service Version**
- 21/tcp open ftp?
  - FileZilla Server 1.2.0
- 135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC
- 139/tcp open netbios-ssn Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
- 445/tcp open microsoft-ds?

**Nmap Done:** 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 55.67 seconds.

### Banner Grabbing Considerations

Banner grabbing significantly impacts the amount of traffic used and the speed of the scan. It is important to be mindful of the options used with nmap and how they affect the scan. Banners can be modified by system administrators to mislead potential attackers.

### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows users to launch user-created scripts to automate various scanning tasks, including DNS enumeration, brute force attacks, and vulnerability identification. NSE scripts are located in the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts` directory.

#### Example: Using the `http-headers` Script

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nmap --script http-headers 192.168.50.6
```

**Nmap Scan Report for 192.168.50.6**
- Host is up (0.14s latency).
- Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)

**Port State Service**
- 22/tcp open ssh
- 80/tcp open http
  - HTTP Headers:
    - Date: Thu, 10 Mar 2022 18:53:29 GMT
    - Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
    - Last-Modified: Thu, 10 Mar 2022 18:51:54 GMT
    - ETag: "d1-5d9e1b5371420"
    - Accept-Ranges: bytes
    - Content-Length: 209
    - Vary: Accept-Encoding
    - Connection: close
    - Content-Type: text/html

**Nmap Done:** 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.11 seconds.

### Viewing Script Information

To view more information about a script, use the `--script-help` option, which displays a description of the script and a URL for more in-depth information.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nmap --script-help http-headers
```

### Port Scanning from Windows

If conducting initial network enumeration from a Windows laptop without internet access, built-in PowerShell functions can be used. The `Test-NetConnection` function checks if an IP responds to ICMP and whether a specified TCP port on the target host is open.

#### Example: Checking SMB Port 445

```powershell
PS C:\Users\student> Test-NetConnection -Port 445 192.168.50.151
```

**Output:**
- ComputerName: 192.168.50.151
- RemoteAddress: 192.168.50.151
- RemotePort: 445
- InterfaceAlias: Ethernet0
- SourceAddress: 192.168.50.152
- TcpTestSucceeded: True

To scan the first 1024 ports on the Domain Controller, use the following PowerShell one-liner:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\student> 1..1024 | % {echo ((New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect("192.168.50.151", $_)) "TCP port $_ is open"} 2>$null
```

### SMB Enumeration

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol has a history of security issues but has been updated and improved over the years. The NetBIOS service listens on TCP port 139 and several UDP ports. While modern implementations of SMB can work without NetBIOS, NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) is required for backward compatibility.

#### Example: Scanning for NetBIOS and SMB Services

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 192.168.50.1-254
kali@kali:~$ cat smb.txt
```

**Output:**
- Host: 192.168.50.21 Status: Up
- Ports: 139/closed/tcp//netbios-ssn///, 445/closed/tcp//microsoft-ds///

#### Using `nbtscan` for Additional NetBIOS Information

```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo nbtscan -r 192.168.50.0/24
```

**Output:**
- IP Address: 192.168.50.124, NetBIOS Name: SAMBA, MAC Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
- IP Address: 192.168.50.134, NetBIOS Name: SAMBAWEB, MAC Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00

### Nmap NSE Scripts for SMB

Nmap offers many useful NSE scripts for discovering and enumerating SMB services. These scripts are located in the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts` directory.

#### Example: Using the `smb-os-discovery` Module

```bash
kali@kali:~$ nmap -v -p 139,445 --script smb-os-discovery 192.168.50.152
```

**Nmap Scan Report for 192.168.50.152**
- Host is up (0.12s latency).
- Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)

**Port State Service Reason**
- 139/tcp open netbios-ssn syn-ack
- 445/tcp open microsoft-ds syn-ack

**Host Script Results:**
- OS: Windows 10 Pro 22000 (Windows 10 Pro 6.3)
- OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_10::-
- Computer name: client01
- NetBIOS computer name: CLIENT01\x00
- Domain name: megacorptwo.com
- Forest name: megacorptwo.com
- FQDN: client01.megacorptwo.com
- System time: 2022-03-17T11:54:20-07:00

**Note:** The reported OS may be inaccurate, as the target host is running Windows 11 instead of the reported Windows 10.

### Conclusion

While Nmap's service and OS enumeration outputs should be taken with a grain of salt, they provide valuable information. NSE scripting provides extra details, such as domain and Active Directory-related information, and is less likely to be detected due to lower traffic volume.
