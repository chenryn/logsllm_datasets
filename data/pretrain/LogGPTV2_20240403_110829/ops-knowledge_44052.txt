Question: "In a transaction system where a Security Identifier is supposed to qualify transactions, failure to include this identifier could lead to various security issues. What are the possible immediate and broader implications of a transaction being sent without the necessary Security Identifier?"
 "A": "The immediate implication is that the destination agent might execute the transaction as if it came from a trusted source, potentially leading to unauthorized access."
 "B": "The immediate implication is that the destination agent might drop the transaction, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition."
 "C": "The broader implication could be a systemic weakening of security protocols, leading to an increased risk of privilege escalation across the system."
 "D": "The broader implication could be that the transaction system's integrity remains intact, as other security measures compensate for the missing identifier."
