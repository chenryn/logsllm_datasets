User: I have Python 3.6 and Windows 7. 
I am able to successfully start the python interpreter in interactive mode, which I have confirmed by going to cmd, and typing in python, so my computer knows how to find the interpreter.
I am confused however, as to how to access files from the interpreter. For example, I have a file called test.py (yes, I made sure the correct file extension was used). 
However, I do not know how to access test.py from the interpreter. Let us say for the sake of argument that the test.py file has been stored in C:\ How then would I access test.py from the interpreter?
Assistant: The simplest way would be to  just do the following in cmd:
C:\path\to\file\test.py
Windows recognizes the file extension and runs it with Python.
Or you can change the directory to where the Python program/script is by using the cd command in the command prompt:
cd C:\path\to\file
Start Python in the terminal and import the script using the import function:
import test
You do not have to specify the .py file extension. The script will only run once per process so you'll need to use the reload function to run it after it's first import.
You can make python run the script from a specific directory:
python C:\path\to\file\test.py
