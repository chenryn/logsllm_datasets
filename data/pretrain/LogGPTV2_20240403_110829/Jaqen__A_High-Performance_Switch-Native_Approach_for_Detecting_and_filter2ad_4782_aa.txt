Abstract
The emergence of programmable switches offers a new oppor-
tunity to revisit ISP-scale defenses for volumetric DDoS at-
tacks. In theory, these can offer better cost vs. performance vs.
ﬂexibility trade-offs relative to proprietary hardware and vir-
tual appliances. However, the ISP setting creates unique chal-
lenges in this regard—we need to run a broad spectrum of de-
tection and mitigation functions natively on the programmable
switch hardware and respond to dynamic adaptive attacks at
scale. Thus, prior efforts in using programmable switches that
assume out-of-band detection and/or use switches merely as
accelerators for speciﬁc tasks are no longer sufﬁcient, and
as such, this potential remains unrealized. To tackle these
challenges, we design and implement Jaqen, a switch-native
approach for volumetric DDoS defense that can run detection
and mitigation functions entirely inline on switches, with-
out relying on additional data plane hardware. We design
switch-optimized, resource-efﬁcient detection and mitigation
building blocks. We design a ﬂexible API to construct a wide
spectrum of best-practice (and future) defense strategies that
efﬁciently use switch capabilities. We build a network-wide
resource manager that quickly adapts to the attack posture
changes. Our experiments show that Jaqen is orders of magni-
tude more performant than existing systems: Jaqen can handle
large-scale hybrid and dynamic attacks within seconds, and
mitigate them effectively at high line-rates (380 Gbps).
1 Introduction
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to be
a destructive force in today’s Internet [1]. Despite decades of
work, volumetric attacks continue to be a severe threat, with
growing attack volumes and types. In this respect, Internet
Service Providers (ISPs), as the infrastructure to route Internet
trafﬁc, are at a unique vantage point to combat such volumetric
attacks without interrupting client-side services.
In this context, programmable switching hardware has
emerged as a promising means to enable defenses against
volumetric DDoS attacks [2–7]. In particular, they promise
better cost, performance, and ﬂexibility tradeoffs, compared
to traditional solutions. For instance, proprietary/ﬁxed hard-
ware appliances are expensive, have limited capabilities, and
hard to upgrade in the ﬁeld (e.g., [8, 9]). On the other hand,
software appliances (e.g., [10]), while dynamic and repro-
grammable, incur large latency, and are not efﬁcient for large
attacks. In addition, both classes of approaches entail high cap-
ital costs [9–11]. In contrast, programmable switches promise
high line-speed guarantees (e.g., 6.5Tbps [12]), sufﬁcient pro-
grammability (e.g., P4 [13]), and lower cost (Table 1).
Realizing this promise, however, is easier said than done,
and the ISP setting creates unique and fundamental challenges
that existing solutions do not address. Given that ISPs are in-
line and on the critical path of large attack trafﬁc volumes, we
need to support a broad spectrum of detection and mitigation
natively on the programmable switches. Unfortunately, exist-
ing programmable switch-based solutions fail on one or more
of these dimensions [3, 4, 6, 7, 14]. Speciﬁcally, existing ef-
forts rely on out-of-band detection with the need to reroute
trafﬁc to separate monitoring infrastructure, which entails ad-
ditional latency and cost [15–17]. Furthermore, many of these
support a small number of mitigation functions [4, 6, 7, 14],
or do so in an inefﬁcient manner that exhausts the limited
switch resources and can disrupt legitimate connections [3].
To this end, we present Jaqen, a switch-native detection
and mitigation system that handles a broad spectrum of volu-
metric attacks [18] within ISPs. Unlike prior solutions, Jaqen
completely runs on programmable switches (i.e., switch-
native) and fully leverages their capabilities for accurate de-
tection and fast response as attack postures change. Jaqen is
an agile system that dynamically distributes detection and mit-
igation capabilities in a network-wide setting when available
switch resources, attack types, and trafﬁc volumes change.
Our overarching goal is to design a secure-yet-practical
defense system, working within the limited switch chip re-
sources (e.g., O(10MB) SRAM and limited accesses to the
SRAM [12]). To see why this is challenging, consider two
natural strawman solutions. First, to cover many attacks, we
can consider running all potential detection and mitigation
mechanisms on the switch. Unfortunately, this is infeasible
due to resource constraints. Alternatively, we can run only a
subset of detection and mitigation modules. However, this cre-
ates blind spots, where we do not have visibility into ongoing
attacks, especially when attacks can dynamically change; i.e.,
the detection module checks for SYN ﬂoods but the attacker
changes to a DNS ampliﬁcation that goes undetected.

As a practical and robust alternative to these strawman solu-
tions, we argue for a broad-spectrum always-on detection and
on-demand mitigation design approach. That is, the detection
logic must continuously (i.e., always-on) identify all attacks
in our scope to avoid blind spots in face of dynamic attacks.
Rather than enable all mitigation modules, we install them
as needed (i.e., on demand) to optimize hardware resource
usage. Given this high-level design philosophy, we address
key algorithmic and system design challenges in Jaqen.
(1) Designing switch-native detection with high coverage:
We build a switch-native, broad-coverage detector for ISPs
by bridging universal sketch techniques in network mon-
itoring [19, 20] and general DDoS detection. Instead of
crafting multiple custom algorithms to achieve coverage
(e.g., [15, 21–27]), universal sketches make it possible to
track a broad range of current and unforeseen metrics with
a single algorithm. We design the detector with two layers:
Data plane—universal sketches as data plane primitives
that can be pulled by the controller or conﬁgured as event
triggers. Control plane—detection API for users to con-
ﬁgure the sketches, query relevant metrics, and compute
detection decisions.
(2) Flexible and performant switch-native mitigation: We
identify a uniﬁed abstraction to implement mitigation with
three interactive components: (1) ﬁltering to drop, allow,
or rate limit packets, (2) analysis to identify malicious traf-
ﬁc, and (3) update to the ﬁltering when needed. For each
component, we design a library of relevant mitigation func-
tions with API based on best-practice mechanisms (e.g.,
intentional SYN drop [28] and DNS matching [23]) using
switch-optimized logic and probabilistic structures [29–33].
Thus, constructing sophisticated (and possibly new) miti-
gation strategies will be like ﬂexibly combining different
building blocks on hardware using our API.
(3) Network-wide management to handle dynamic attacks:
When attack postures change, Jaqen needs to compute a
new resource allocation to redirect trafﬁc to other available
switches with the smallest rerouting cost. We formulate
this as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP). However, for large
ISPs, a state-of-the-art solver could take a long time (10s of
min) to ﬁnish. Thus, we design a responsive near-optimal
heuristic that is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster.
We implement Jaqen in Barefoot Toﬁno switches [12] us-
ing the P4 language [13]. Our evaluation, performed on a set
of one 6.5 Tbps programmable switch and eleven 40 Gbps
servers, shows that Jaqen (1) accurately detects the attack type
and estimates the attack volume with 97% accuracy when the
attack trafﬁc is not negligible (>1.5% of tested 380-Gbps
throughput), (2) reacts to hybrid and dynamic DDoS attacks
within 15-sec (including 10-sec detection period), and (3) mit-
igates the attack trafﬁc with low false positives and negatives
(varying from 0.0 to 0.072). Although our testbed only gen-
erates 380 Gbps trafﬁc due to limited equipment, Jaqen with
one switch can potentially handle Tbps-level attacks without
interrupting legitimate users.
Contributions and roadmap. In summary, this paper makes
the following contributions:
• Highlighting the requirements for ISP-based defense and
identifying security limitations of existing P4-based de-
fense solutions in the ISP setting. (§2)
• An integrated DDoS detection and mitigation framework
entirely on programmable switches for defending volumet-
ric attacks in ISPs. (§3)
• A broad-spectrum switch-native detector using universal
sketching techniques and a library of highly optimized
mitigation primitives for developers to write state-of-the-
art and possibly new mitigation strategies in P4. (§4,§5)
• A network-wide resource manager that optimally deploys
detection and mitigation modules in the network. (§6).
• An end-to-end system realization of Jaqen (§7) and demon-
stration of its effectiveness in handling real-world large-
scale dynamic attack. (§8)
2 Background and Motivation
In this section, we begin by highlighting the requirements for
ISP-centric defense and the opportunities that programmable
switches bring. We then discuss existing defense solutions
and highlight their shortcomings.
2.1 Requirements for ISP-centric Defense
ISPs own a large hierarchy of switches and routers to route
user trafﬁc to and from destinations, but usually do not access
application-level user information. Given this nature, defend-
ing volumetric attacks in ISPs is appealing and ISP-based de-
fense systems shall consider the following requirements:
• Impact on benign trafﬁc: For service providers, the over-
arching goal is to improve user experiences for legitimate
users. Thus, ISP-based defenses must not interrupt or drop
legitimate user connections and shall not add large extra la-
tency to benign trafﬁc. Ideally, ISPs should limit the amount
of trafﬁc rerouted to out-of-band detection and scrubbing
centers, and limit the usage of slow packet processing ele-
ments (e.g., servers) on the critical network paths.
• Defense performance: As a defense system, we need to
support high packet processing capabilities to handle a
broad range of existing and future attacks.
• Cost efﬁciency: As ISPs need to handle massive amounts of
trafﬁc every day (e.g., 100PB per day at AT&T in 2016 [37],
we want to reduce the capital cost of defense devices and
potentially their operational cost.
Opportunities of Programmable Switches. As observed in
concurrent efforts [3–5, 7], modern programmable switches
are appealing to augment DDoS defense performance. We
envision these switches are promising in fulﬁlling require-
