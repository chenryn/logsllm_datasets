## No 1902 sprint release:
In the 1902 sprint, we have started work to migrate from AzureRm to Az-* module. This has taken longer than expected due to a couple of issues with Az-* cmdlets. 
We are going to continue our effort to resolve the issues and work on stabilizing the module in 1903 and hope to do a combined release for 1902 and 1903 mid-March.
