## Abstract
With over one trillion mobile messages delivered annually worldwide, SMS has become a prime target for various attacks and frauds, such as spamming, phishing, and spoofing. These SMS-based attacks pose significant security threats to both mobile users and cellular network operators, including information theft, overcharging, battery exhaustion, and network congestion. Despite the growing threat, effective countermeasures are lagging behind. To address this, we propose SMS-Watchdog, a lightweight scheme that can detect anomalous SMS behaviors with high accuracy. Our key contributions are:

1. **Behavioral Regularities:** After analyzing an SMS trace collected over five months, we identified window-based regularities in user behavior, specifically in whom they send messages to and how frequently.

2. **Detection Schemes:** We propose four detection schemes that build normal social behavior profiles for each SMS user and use these profiles to detect anomalies in real-time. Each scheme requires minimal memory (typically, at most 12 states per user), ensuring low overhead for online anomaly detection.

3. **Evaluation:** We evaluated these four schemes and two hybrid approaches using realistic SMS traces. The results show that the hybrid approaches can detect more than 92% of SMS-based attacks with a false alarm rate of 8.5%, or approximately two-thirds of the attacks without any false alarms, depending on parameter settings.

## 1. Introduction
The Short Message Service (SMS) provided by cellular carriers is a connectionless message transfer service with limited capacity. Since its introduction in December 1992, SMS has experienced rapid growth. According to IDC, the number of SMS subscribers in the US was estimated at 102 million in 2006 and is expected to reach 184 million by 2011, with the number of short messages delivered increasing from 157 billion in 2006 to 512 billion in 2011. Gartner reports that the Asia-Pacific region, where SMS subscribers sent 1.5 trillion messages in 2007, leads the global SMS market, followed by North America and Western Europe, which generated 189 and 202 billion messages, respectively, in 2007.

Due to its popularity, SMS has become a lucrative target for fraudulent activities, such as spamming, phishing, and spoofing. For example, 88% of mobile users in China have been affected by SMS spam. Additionally, the convergence of telecommunications and the Internet has led to the emergence of SMS phishing, or "SMiShing," which can steal confidential information or spread malware. SMS spoofing, another type of attack, manipulates address information in SMS messages to mimic legitimate devices, leading to network vulnerabilities. Other SMS-based attacks include SMS flooding, which aims to overload the cellular network, and SMS faking, which mimics the behavior of an SMS switch to send messages. SMS flooding can cause significant disruptions, potentially shutting down cellular services in large areas.

Effective countermeasures for SMS-based attacks are still lacking. Many existing solutions, inspired by IP network techniques, focus on detecting malware on mobile devices. For instance, signature-based detection schemes examine mobile network traffic or power usage for known malware signatures. Machine learning approaches, such as those developed in [1], discriminate between normal and malicious behavior at the system event and API call levels. However, these methods have limitations: not all SMS-based attacks originate from malware, and many require additional computational resources, accelerating battery drain. Moreover, mobile operating systems often lack robust countermeasures to prevent malware from disabling resident detection schemes.

In this work, we propose a different approach to detect anomalous SMS behaviors. SMS-Watchdog, our proposed framework, is deployed at a location where short message records can be easily accessed, such as the Short Messaging Service Center (SMSC). This alleviates the shortcomings of device-resident detection schemes, such as extra power consumption and the inability to catch spoofed messages. Motivated by observations from a real-world SMS dataset, our work leverages the inherent regularities in typical SMS user behaviors for anomaly detection. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:

1. **Behavioral Regularities:** After analyzing an SMS trace collected over five months, we found that most SMS users exhibit window-based regularities in their messaging patterns, including whom they send messages to and the frequency of these messages.
   
2. **Detection Schemes:** We propose four detection schemes that build normal social behavior profiles for each SMS user and use these profiles to detect anomalies in real-time. Each scheme stores only a few states (typically, at most 12 states) in memory for each user, ensuring low overhead for online anomaly detection.
   
3. **Evaluation:** We evaluate these four schemes and two hybrid approaches using realistic SMS traces. The results show that the hybrid approaches can detect more than 92% of SMS-based attacks with a false alarm rate of 8.5%, or approximately two-thirds of the attacks without any false alarms, depending on parameter settings.

### Related Work
In [27], Zerfos et al. analyzed an SMS trace from a national carrier in India, examining message size distribution, service time, and thread-level characteristics. Meng et al. later used the same trace to study delivery reliability and latency. While their trace covered more users, it lasted only three weeks. In contrast, our trace spans five months, providing insights into long-term and persistent user behaviors. Enck et al. demonstrated that SMS flooding from the Internet can cause severe denial-of-service attacks and proposed countermeasures [6]. Our work complements theirs by identifying anomalous SMS behaviors through comparison with normal user profiles.

Techniques based on profiling human social behaviors have been applied to detect anomalies in other types of network traffic. For example, Stolfo et al. developed a data mining system for email users, using methods like user cliques, Hellinger distance, and cumulative distributions [20]. Yan et al. applied change-point detection to identify worm propagation in IM networks, observing that the distribution of messages sent to each contact is highly skewed [26]. We use information-theoretical measures to detect anomalies in SMS traffic, a technique previously applied to Internet traffic [11][14]. Our work also addresses scalability issues not considered in previous research.

Anomaly detection for mobile phone networks has a long history. Calling activities have been examined to detect mobile phone fraud [7][23][5], and mobility patterns have been profiled to detect cloning attacks and cell phone losses [25][21]. With the rise of smartphones, more malware instances have been observed. Existing approaches to detect mobile malware profile normal application behaviors [9][1]; our work focuses on profiling normal SMS user behaviors.

## 2. Background on SMS and SMS Traces

### 2.1. SMS Architecture
SMS is a service that provides a connectionless transfer of messages with up to 160 characters using signaling channels in cellular networks. Figure 1 illustrates the basic SMS architecture in a GSM-based system. A short message sender uses an originating Mobile Station (MS) to send a message to a receiver. The message is delivered to a nearby Base Station System (BSS) via the GSM signaling channel and then to the associated Mobile Switching Center (MSC). The MSC checks with the Visitor Location Register (VLR) to verify if the originating MS is allowed to use the SMS service. If allowed, the MSC routes the message to the Short Message Service Center (SMSC), a store-and-forward server that handles SMS traffic.

The SMSC is responsible for forwarding the message to the targeted terminating MS. It queries the Home Location Register (HLR) to obtain the serving MSC address of the terminating MS. The HLR responds with the necessary information, and the SMSC forwards the message to the appropriate MSC, which further queries its VLR for the location area of the terminating MS. Once the location is found, the message is delivered through the nearby BSS.

### 2.2. SMS Trace Collection
The SMS trace used in this work was collected from an SMS proxy in Italy. This proxy connects to the Internet and the GSM network through a GSM modem. There are two classes of users for this proxy. The first class uses an MS to send short messages, which are delivered through the GPRS network to the proxy and then forwarded to recipients. The second class sends messages to the proxy via the Internet and then to receiving MSes through the GSM modem. The economic incentive for this proxy is the price difference between regular SMS and GPRS messages.

The proxy was launched in early 2008, and we obtained communication logs from April 15, 2008, to September 14, 2008. During this period, 2,121 users sent 146,334 short messages through the proxy. This trace covers a large number of users and is representative of general SMS traffic. Due to its short history, the proxy has not yet suffered from malicious attacks, allowing us to analyze the behavior of normal SMS users. The long time span of the trace enables us to investigate persistent behavioral patterns, unlike previous work that focused on short-term analysis [27][13].

## 3. Trace Analysis

### 3.1. System Dynamics
Figure 2 shows the number of short messages observed by the SMS proxy each day. We observe an increasing trend in the number of messages, attributed to the growing number of users during the trace collection period. For example, the number of messages increased by 67% from May to August. Figure 2 also depicts the number of active users, with 972 active customers in August compared to 662 in May.

Although the number of users was not stationary, we find that the number of messages sent by each user and the number of receivers per sender each day are quite stable. On average, an active user sends about 5.4 messages to 2.4 recipients daily. We focus on persistent users who used the proxy for at least 60 days, contributing about 75% of the total messages.

### 3.2. Temporally Periodic Behaviors of Persistent Users
We are interested in statistically time-invariant metrics that characterize SMS user behaviors. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the number of messages and receivers per sender per day. We find that the average number of messages and recipients per user is relatively stable over time. Figure 4 shows the average numbers of messages for persistent users, highlighting the temporal periodicity in their behavior.

This analysis forms the basis for building normal behavior profiles and detecting anomalies in real-time.
