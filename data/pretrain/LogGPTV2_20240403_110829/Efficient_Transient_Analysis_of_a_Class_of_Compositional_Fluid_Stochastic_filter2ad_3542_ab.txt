interact with its environment and can obviously be analyzed
independently.

The ﬁrst two assumptions and the ﬁfth assumption also

intermediate boundaries for the ﬂuid ﬂow exist. This means
that the ﬂow changes its direction or stops at the natural

III. STOCHASTIC BEHAVIOR OF THE NET
To derive the stochastic behavior, we ﬁrst deﬁne the matrices
of the complete net following [16], [18]. Let
qk,l(t, x) =
F (t, (mk, x))
0
if t ∈ E(mk) ∧ mk
otherwise
t→ ml
(cid:8)
rates are the entries of an (|Md| × |Md|) matrix Q(t, x).
For U ⊂ Te, we write Q(U, x) =
t∈U Q(t, x), and for
U = Te, we write Q(x) rather than Q(Te, x). To capture
diagonal elements, we deﬁne the diagonal matrix D with
diagonal elements
(cid:9)
Dk,k(x) =
Qk,l(x).
|Md|(cid:2)
l=1
∂τ
∂xc
∂ (π(τ, x)Rc(x))
Furthermore, we deﬁne the matrix of ﬂuid ﬂows for continuous
place pc ∈ Pc as Rc(x) = diag(rc(mk, x)) and the row
vector π(τ, x) = (πk(τ, x)) for mk ∈ Md, τ ≥ 0. The vector
π(τ, x) contains the probability densities of ﬁnding the FSPN
in discrete states mk ∈ Md at time τ when the ﬂuid level
is x. Initially πk(0, x) = 1 for x = x0, k = 0, and it is 0
otherwise. Without ﬂush-out arcs, the evaluation of π(τ, x)
(cid:2)
follows the PDEs
∂π(τ, x)
+
pc∈Pc
= π(τ, x) (Q(x)−D(x)) .
(1)
With ﬂush-out arcs the PDEs become more complex, because
several cases with empty and non-empty continuous places
have to be considered. We use in the following a slightly
different notation to introduce the PDEs than in the original
papers [15], [16], which is in our opinion more intuitive.
Below it will be shown that with the introduced compositional
structure, ﬂush-out arcs can be handled much easier.
With ﬂush-out arcs, we have to consider transitions from
Pc(cid:7),
transitions connected with ﬂush-out arcs to
continuous places. Let Pc(cid:7) = T \ Pc(cid:7), and let F(t) =
{p | p ∈ Pc, p ∈ (cid:7)t} be the set of continuous places which
are ﬂushed out by ﬁring transition t. We assume that the
places in F(t) have the indices it
1 through it|F (t)|. The vector
x(F(t)) = (xc)pc∈F (t) is equal to the vector x restricted to
the places in F(t). With ﬂush-out arcs, (1) becomes

and the indicator function δ (x(F(t)) = 0) = 1 if all entries of
x that belong to places from F(t) (i.e., continuous places that
are ﬂushed out by t) are zero, otherwise the function returns
0 which implies that the multiple integral is not evaluated.
Observe that (2) reduces to (1) when there are no ﬂush-out
arcs connected to continuous places, and hence, Pc(cid:7) = ∅
and F(t) = ∅. No additional boundary equations are required
because they are included in the deﬁnition of ﬂow rates.

are described by row vectors (k0, k) of length C + 1 such
that k = (k1, . . . , kC) with kc = 0, . . . , nc − 1 being the
discretized continuous state and k0 being the discrete state.
In this discretization, the ﬂow is deﬁned to be constant over
interval kc of length δc and the discretized continuous state kc
can only change to state kc − 1 or kc + 1 in one transition.
Transition rates between discrete states due to ﬁring transi-

Transitions resulting from a change of ﬂuid level may change
state (mk, k) to (mk, k ± I1c) for some pc ∈ Pc as long as
the transition is allowed, i.e., resulting state belongs to the
reachable state space. Thus, we deﬁne

for time τ with initial condition π(0) resulting from the
discretized initial state of the FSPN, is then the probability
density of the FSPN at time τ. From π(τ ) further transient
results can be derived.
In principle, an FSPN can be analyzed by constructing
matrix Q and then solving the resulting ODE in (7). However,
two quite general problems occur implying that this approach
can realistically only be used for relatively simple and small
nets with one or two continuous places:
1) The evaluation of the integrals in (3) and (4) can be
cumbersome for more complex functions.
2) The curse of dimensionality implies that the reachable
state space grows rapidly for an increasing number
of continuous places and a ﬁner discretization; a ﬁne
discretization is often necessary to obtain a sufﬁcient
accuracy.
For the ﬁrst problem, we restrict the class of nets as done
above. Especially the decomposability of the ﬂow and rate
functions allow us to separate the different dimensions for
integration. To cope with very large state spaces, we present
ﬁrst an approach to represent matrix Q in a hierarchical
form where the different submatrices can be represented as
the sum of Kronecker products of small matrices. Then in
the following section, we introduce an approach to avoid
additionally the complete enumeration of the state space in
vector π(τ ) by using implicit approximate representations that
have been recently developed in the ﬁeld of statistical physics
and for the solution of higher dimensional PDEs [17].
By exploiting the compositional structure of SFSPNs, ma-
trix Q can be represented in compact form. Let S (j) be the
projection of the global state space S to the places from P (j).
States of subnet j are represented by (m(j), x(j)) where m(j)
includes the marking of the discrete places from P (j) and x(j)
is the marking of the continuous place. For subnets without
