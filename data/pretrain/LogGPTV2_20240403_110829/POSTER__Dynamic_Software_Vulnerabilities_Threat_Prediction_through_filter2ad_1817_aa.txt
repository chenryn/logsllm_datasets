ABSTRACT 
Publicly  available  software  vulnerabilities  and  exploit  codes  are 
often  utilized  by  malicious  actors  to  launch  cyberattack  to 
vulnerable  targets.  Therefore,  organizations  not  only  need  to 
update  their  software  to  the  latest  version,  they  need  to  do 
effective  patch  management  and  also  prioritize  the  patching 
schedule. In order to prevent future cyber threat based on publicly 
available resources on the Internet, this study propose a dynamic 
vulnerability  threat  assessment  model  to  predict  the  exploited 
tendency  for  each  vulnerability  (i.e.,  CVE).  The  model  considers 
many  aspects  of  vulnerability  which  are  gathered  from  multiple 
sources.  Features  range  from  profile  information  to  contextual 
information  of  Twitter  discussion  about  these  vulnerabilities. 
When  applied  to  predict  the  vulnerabilities  exploitation  in  real 
world  data,  it  showed  better  prediction  accuracy  using  our 
approach  and  has  been  deployed  into  our  threat  intelligence 
platform as one of the analytic functions.

1  Introduction 
The  publications  and  discussions  of  vulnerabilities  are 
frequently  found  on  internet  forums;  social  media  have  become 
major  platforms  for  such  information  exchange.  The goal  of  this 
study is to utilize messages on Twitter regarding vulnerabilities to 
assess the probability a vulnerability will be exploited in the real-
world. In addition to messages on Twitter, vulnerability databases 
such  as  NVD,  CVE  Details,  VulDB,  ExploitDB  and  Symantec  are 
adopted to extract the features to describe a vulnerability.  
Cybercriminals use public vulnerability information to develop 
exploit code used that as part of the cyber kill chain. They try to 
exploit the vulnerabilities and trigger malicious code on the target 
server or device. Current security measures generally initiate the 
analysis  of  malicious  activities  after  breaches  occur.  Such  a 
reactive approach is not effective to critical infrastructure. In other 
words,  there  is  a  major  theoretical  shortfall  in  current  cyber 
defense architecture [1]. 
Online vulnerability discussions can help security professionals 
gain  first-hand  information  to  avoid  being  affected  by  potential 
cyberattack. Sabottke et al. [2] explored the opportunities for early 
exploit  detection  using  information  available  on  Twitter.  Their 
techniques  utilized  supervised  machine  learning  (i.e.,  an  Random 
Forest  model)  and  ground  truth  about  exploits  based  on  Exploit 
Database  (ExploitDB)  [3]  and  descriptions  of  Symantec  attack 
signature  [4].  Sapienza  et  al.  [5]  introduced  a  framework  that 
generates  warnings  of  imminent  or  current  cyber-threats  by 
leveraging  unconventional,  public  data  sensors,  such  as  Twitter 
and  the  Darknet.  Their  system  monitors  social  media  feeds  of 
some  prominent  security  researchers,  analysts,  and  white-hat 
to  exploits, 
hackers,  scanning 
vulnerabilities,  and  other 
topics. 
Afterward, it applies text mining techniques to identify important 
terms and remove irrelevant terms.

Several  studies  have  utilized  social  media  data  in  predicting 
vulnerability exploits. For example, Sauerwein et al. [6], Khandpur 
et al. [7], Almukaynizi et al. [8][9], Hernandez-Suarez et al. [10], 
Shu  et  al.  [11],  and  Tavabi  et  al.  [12].  Twitter  data  is  a  good 
intelligence  source  since  exploits  are  often  discussed  on  Twitter 
before they are publicly disclosed [2][5], and it has been reported 
that  the  Twitter  activities  of  security  experts  are  a  promising 
source for cyber-threat anticipation.

In  this  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  vulnerability  threat 
assessment  model  to  predict  the  exploited  tendency  for  each 
vulnerability  (i.e.,  CVE).  The  proposed  approach  is  shown  in 
Figure  1.    For  the  input  features,  we  not  only  consider  the  basic 
profile  features  of  vulnerability  collected  from  multiple  sources, 
we also collect twitter data about all the vulnerabilities with CVE 
number to set up the exploit prediction model. For all the tweets 
about  vulnerability,  we  use  reserved  cybersecurity-related 
keywords and count the word frequency. 
Exposures  Detail  (CVE  Details),  Vulnerability  Database  (VulDB), 
and twitter data. The data we collected covers from 1999 to 2019. 
We  use  the  feature  importance  of  Random  Forest  to  do  feature 
selection. For feature selection, 90% were randomly picked as the 
training data, and 10% were randomly picked as the testing data. 
Among  98  features,  we  select  top  49  features  with  the  highest 
variable importance score generated by Random Forest as the final 
input features after 5 runs of experiments. It would be meaningful 
to know which features are most relevant to predicting real-world 
exploits. Figure 2 shows the model features for exploit prediction. 
In total, 49 features were used in our prediction models.  
Figure 1: The proposed approach. 
Together with the extracted features and ground truth, sample 
data  for  training  and  testing  our  classifier  are  obtained  in  the 
format of vulnerabilities described by  features and exploited/not-
exploited  labels.  Three  sources  are  used  to  identify  the  set  of 
vulnerabilities  exploited  in  the  real-world,  including  ExploitDB 
(exploit  code)  and  Symantec  (Symantec  attack  signature).  These 
sources  report  vulnerabilities  that  have  been  exploited  and  serve 
as the ground truth to label the vulnerabilities. 
For the proposed algorithm, we apply Random Forest (RF) [13] 
as the prediction model because RF can deal with both numerical 
and categorial data compared with SVM. The basis of the modern 
practice of random forests, including: (1) using out-of-bag error as 
an  estimate  of  the  generalization  error.  (2)  measuring  variable 
importance  through  permutation.  For  the  Titter  vulnerability 
mentioned data, we apply the keyword suggested by Sabottke et 
al.  [2],  human  expert  manually  reserved,  and  also  the  outcome 
labels generated by LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model. Note 
that Sabottke et al. [2] identified the keywords appearing in tweets 
that are effective in exploit prediction by calculating their mutual
