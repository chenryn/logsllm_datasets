again, trying to game the system.
Mental agility is possible with real-t ime interactions, like the
ones laid out here. However, you cannot save an operation if you
use bad information where communication is asynchronous, such
as a phish. If you send a spear phish as the target’s spouse’s divorce
lawyer only to find out they were divorced 30 years ago, you will
likely not come back from that. You will have to start from scratch,
keeping in mind that the target is probably a little more on edge
given your previous play.
Mental agility is as much about making fresh connections
between different things as it is teasing out problems and thinking
86 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
on your feet to solve them in the most efficient way possible. It’s tak-
ing in information and applying it to your current circumstances.
There is one more thing that can’t go unnoted about mental
agility— it’s bred by calmness. If you’re too anxious, there’s a good
chance you will miss the opportunity to pivot well. If you are too
uptight, there’s a good chance you’ll want to do what’s been done
before. AMs is less about traditional thinking and more about for-
ward thinking.
As an ethical attacker, you will also require two more things for
perfect potency: common sense and morals, both of which we will
briefly cover in this chapter, too. But before we discuss that, let’s
look at how your curiosity can pay off in the first place.
Spoiler alert: It’s through OSINT.
Curiosity
Curiosity is a basic element of our cognition, yet its biological
function, mechanisms, and neural underpinning remain poorly
understood. It is nonetheless a motivator for learning, influential
in decision-making, and crucial for a functioning and prevailing
attacker mindset. Moreover, for the ethical or malicious attacker,
curiosity serves as a driving force in the pursuit of information and
knowledge. Cultivating it is fundamental, and the best way of bait-
ing it is to ask questions.
Curiosity, however, can be viewed on a spectrum. You may have
more or less than someone else, but the amount you have doesn’t
preclude or facilitate your ability as an ethical attacker (EA) for
obvious reasons. The most evident is that curiosity doesn’t guaran-
tee you’ll find your way to useful or valuable information or that
you’ll know when to stop searching for information.
Lastly, there will always be someone less curious than you, and
there will also always be someone more curious than you. To help
foster your own curiosity, let’s perform two exercises. The first will
be to foster an agile curiosity, and the second will be to build an
understanding of it through the AMs lens.
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 87
The Exercise: Part 1
To cultivate curiosity, you will also have to start building on your
persistence and agility. To eventually use all of them together, you
must look to information. Find a news article on any company of
your choosing. Identify the key bits of information and start down
the mental agility course I am about to lay out. The first step is to
ask yourself how you could use this information to form an objec-
tive and possibly even the beginnings of a pretext. The rub is that
you can use only one article, so pick wisely.
I will start with Apple because they are my favorite company
on Earth, and I want them to be secure. I would be distraught if
they were attacked and they didn’t have time to turn back their key-
board from butterfly to scissor- switch before the next MacBook Air
comes out.
For this, exercise, I typed Apple into Google and selected the
News tab. I was offered many articles to choose from. I went to an
NBC article by David Ingram, with the title “Facebook and Apple
are in a fight. Your browsing history is in the middle.” Here’s an
excerpt from the article:
Apple and Facebook are going to need each other in the long run,
because billions of people want their social media apps to work
well on their phones and tablets. But first, the two California tech
giants need to settle a brawl that’s playing out in newspaper ads,
industry meetings and potentially federal court.
In the next few weeks, Apple is planning to roll out a new
feature on its devices that will alert people when an app such as
Facebook is trying to “track your activity across other companies’
apps and websites.” People will have options such as “Ask App not
to Track” or “Allow.”
“Users should know when their data is being collected and
shared across other apps and websites—a nd they should have
the choice to allow that or not,” Apple said in a statement. “App
88 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to
change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted adver-
tising, it simply requires they give users a choice.”
There are two points I care about here:
1. That the article makes the leap that the two might end up in
court over this
2. That Apple is stating nothing has to change in the creation of
targeted advertising, except for people to opt in or out of it
The article then goes on to say:
“Apple’s move isn’t about privacy, it’s about profit,” Facebook
said in a statement. It argues that Apple stands to gain if more of
the internet becomes subscription-b ased, because Apple collects
commissions from its app store.
Apple has said the new tracking notifications will start to
appear in early 2021. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Fron-
tier Foundation support them.
If I had to build a pretext out of this article, I would likely use
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), founded by none other
than Steve Wozniak, John Perry Barlow, Mitchell Kapor, and John
Gilmore. I would build the attack around growing concern that
Apple might be hedging its bets on a subscription- based Internet
and information model, citing that the EFF would be willing to con-
tinue support as long as Apple could categorically state that it did
not intend to profit from pseudo-p rivacy. An attack like this would
best be served via vish (voice phishing call) and pish (email meant
to gain access or at the very least certain details, such as that the
account is active).
It could be something as simple as sending a request for com-
ment on an article the EFF is releasing on its stance with regard to
Facebook and privacy. There is no correct sequence, I could send
the phish and chase a reply the next day by vish, or I could call first,
portending the phish.
I might also attempt something more complex and wily such
as a notice about information that has been leaked by to the EFF
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 89
concerning a vulnerability in Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency
framework, which is a consent interface that notifies an Apple iOS
user when an app requests access to your microphone, camera,
or location. A call to warn them followed by the link in an email,
potentially while I am still on the call, might suffice. However, in
cases such as this, curiosity might kill the cat, and I might only have
to send one phish and wait for the click.
The Exercise: Part 2
Stay with the same target as before or pick a new one and write
down 10 or more questions you’d like to know the answers to. The
true skill of an EA at this stage is to form more questions based on
the first round of answers. An experienced attacker will continue
this cycle until they feel they have complete knowledge on which
to mount their attack. Most of the time, it’s not enough to know
about the company or individual you’re attacking— you must have
in- depth knowledge to complement both your pretext and the facil-
itation of objective achievement.
There are 11 rudimentary questions I’d start with for any target
I had no existing knowledge of. For this exercise, I will use Nes-
presso, because (a) I know little about them other than their main
product is coffee, and (b) I would also hate for them to be attacked
and not have enough time to put a caffeinated mocha capsule into
production. So I’ll give them a head start by outlining how an attack
might be built up against them. Here are the questions I’d start off
with when considering an in- person social engineering attack:
1. What do they do?
2. Where are they headquartered?
3. How many offices do they have in the country?
4. Have they been in the news recently?
5. Who is their leadership?
6. Who are their vendors?
7. What could be considered their biggest competitive advantage?
90 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
8. Are they regulated by any government agency or authority?
9. How many employees do they have?
10. How large is their social media footprint, and who is
associated?
11. According to the news, have they been successfully
attacked before?
The answers to these would, for me, spawn the following
questions:
1. Are there internal images online of their real estate?
2. Are there any images showing their employee ID badges?
3. Are there internal documents online?
4. For what do they use their vendors?
5. How much contact information can I get for people highest
up— emails, phone numbers, assistant information?
Those questions will typically be followed by more questions,
and they would start to narrow in on the pretext, which I would
have started to identify with the answer to question 6 for this par-
ticular search. This process is cyclical in nature and will yield new
questions with new answers that, in massive plot twist, will end up
with more questions. . . The one other thing that I’d like to note here
is that the further you get into this process, the more you will have
to rely on Google dorks and efficient disregarding of information
not critical for your needs.
If you are doing a night break- in, you will have to build a differ-
ent pretext and look at different questions. For instance, if I were to
be breaking into Nespresso headquarters at night, I would likely not
show up as a vendor. My first 11 questions would differ slightly, too,
with more concern placed on their security, security vendors, build-
ing layout, and shift patterns. Without listing them here, I’d likely
turn up as a vendor spraying for pests overnight.
Also, the questions you first ask when building an attack rely
heavily on the type of attack you expect to perform or are contracted
to perform. If the client wants you to vish them, your questions will
be greatly directed by the flags, which are pieces of information
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 91
or assets, the client wants you to obtain as well as target numbers
and other contact information. If your attack includes all vectors—
vishing, phishing, and in- person— you will start to build a more
intricate attack where all the vectors functionally overlap, allowing
progress with every email, call, and step taken.
One other significant consideration will help you know when
to stop an intensive search for information: it’s when you have a
solid pretext— when all the questions related to your pretext are
answered— and when you have enough insight into the business’s
environment that it feels almost familiar to you. With this in mind,
always remember that a pretext is to conceal your identity as a
threat based on your objective.
A pretext is a narrative in which you are the details. Addition-
ally, your pretext may have the air of a threat to it without it being
a conscious decision, which is something people struggle with
time to time—a lawyer could be perceived as a threat, for example.
A lawyer showing up in a rush for an appointment apparently no
one knows about won’t always portend brilliant and joyful things to
come for the people within an organization. But that’s not the job;
the job of a pretext isn’t to leave people feeling any particular way.
Its job is only to protect you as a threat. So sometimes you will have
to let your pretext lean on society’s biases and do the heavy lifting
for you. Your presence doesn’t have to induce feelings of happiness
from everyone you meet within the organization. It simply has to
divert attention away from your true intentions as an attacker.
My last point on pretexts is only to stress that you must never
actively try to scare or bully someone while in character. You will
not leave any room for a teachable moment if you opt for that sort
of performance. You can show up as a firefighter without telling
everyone you meet they are about to burn to death.
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn’t state that the questions I’ve
listed aren’t magic. They may not be the right questions for your
target, but I have more often than not found them to be a good start.
Ultimately, the questions they build up to answer are “What is
your objective?” and “Where is this target weakest?” Also, the first
stage of this cycle takes everyone a notably different amount of time
92 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
to get through. I can generally achieve this over 4 to 5 hours of rig-
orous searching. Some people will be much faster and some, pos-
sibly, a little slower.
Persistence
Our curiosity will not pay off without persistence. We aren’t talking
about heroic persistence, laughing in the face of danger and defy-
ing all odds. We are leaning toward a persistence recognizable as
not giving up on finding and using information against your target.
Curiosity and persistence in the pursuit of knowledge mean that
you are forever aiming for the Goldilocks effect— consuming infor-
mation that’s not too long, detailed, and complex, yet not too short,
simple, and watered down. This takes some time to get perfect, and
I still slip now and then. (Remember in Chapter 3, “The Attacker
Mindset Framework,” I described how I went in as a satellite spe-
cialist there to renew a license and literally started to inspect the
equipment on the roof. There was also a time I walked into a build-
ing pretending to be a Swedish convoy only to realize that I was
in the presence of people who actually spoke Swedish (I do not).
So, I was quickly escorted out.) Striking the balance of using the
information you have suitably is not easy. There are times, however,
where persistence is critical to a mission’s progress. I found this out
via a restroom cubicle in New York.
Last we left off on this story, I was pinballing in and out of turn-
stiles, pretending to be baffled each time my fake card didn’t work
in front of a security guard who was not at all moved by my pleas of
running late for a very important meeting. Each time I tried a new
reader and it failed to read my card and grant me access, mainly
because my card was a complete dud, I looked at the security card
with a bemused look on my face.
“He is going to hit the roof!” I said trying my card on the last
turnstile reader. “I am now so late, I’m pretty much just early for
next week’s meeting,” I added in jovial defeat. “What should I
do?” I asked as he looked me up and down. I love asking people
Curiosity, Persistence, and Agility 93
questions like this, because it speaks right to their responsibilities,
and it places an onus on them that is hard to fight. It also leaves
them uneasy with the new pressure of having to decide something
quite quickly with little information. Not this person, though.
“What exactly are you here for?” the guard said, staring back at
me with a certain indifference to his tone.
“I am delivering the paperwork for the . . .” I lowered my voice,
and leaned closer to him (with the glass gates separating us). “. . .
the thing that’s not going too well,” I finished, still looking at him
directly. He cocked his head slightly to the side, as if he wasn’t sure
what I was telling him. “The merger,” I said briskly, still acting like
I was sharing a secret with him.
“Oh, that,” he said quietly as if he, too, wanted to keep it a secret.
Naturally, this made no sense seeing as it was across multiple media
outlets. There was absolutely no poverty of information regarding
this merger, but I was about to give him information that only he
would know. Making people feel trusted will generally help them
trust you.
“Yeah, look!” I said, unclipping my briefcase. “There’s so much
to be negotiated and signed that even just this will take us days to go
through, but it will all get signed by Friday!” Before he could ask me
more, I made the most genius move I’ve ever made and went with
chaos as a companion. I accidentally dropped all of the paper onto
the floor. On his side of course. “Oh my gosh!” I yelled in alarm.
“This is not good!” I continued yelling. “Can you help me?” I said,
petitioning for access from the other side.
Completely ignoring me, he said only, “Other way, please” as he
now tried to ward off a group of three people walking toward the
gates from stepping on the paperwork.
“No one can see those!” I said, straining my voice. “They are
very confidential!”
“Oh, please don’t stand on that!” I urged the passersby. As the
guard turned his back on me to redirect the group, I hurdled the
lower turnstile meant for access and hurriedly made my way to
scoop up the papers. “I should get them back into order before I go
up there. Do you mind if I just sit on those sofas there and regroup?”
94 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
“Let me see your badge,” the guard responded as he made his
way to silence the now beeping gate sounding the alarm of circum-
vention a little obnoxiously for my liking.
“Here!” I snapped, pushing it in his hand. “I need to sort these,”
I asserted, one last time.
“I have to look at this. Do you have ID on you?”
“Of course— one second,” I explained, reaching into my pocket.
I handed him my ID. Thankfully we are allowed fake ones for the
job— although it should be noted that they are sanctioned, and if
they showed up as being used on an airline or in a traffic stop (which
would be my two preferred uses), I would probably be ejected from
