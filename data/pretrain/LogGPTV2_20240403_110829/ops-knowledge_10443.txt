User: I would like to know if is there a way to validate that a request (say a POST or a GET) was made over https, 
I need to check this in a webapp2.RequestHandler to invalidate every request that is not sent via https
best regards
Assistant: If you are using GAE Flex (where the secure: directive doesn't work), the only way I've found to detect this (to redirect http->https myself) is to check if request.environ['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'] == 'https'
