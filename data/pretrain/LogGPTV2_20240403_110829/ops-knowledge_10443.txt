**Subject: Validating HTTPS Requests in webapp2.RequestHandler**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am seeking guidance on how to validate that an HTTP request (such as a POST or GET) is made over HTTPS. Specifically, I need to implement this check within a `webapp2.RequestHandler` to invalidate any requests that are not sent via HTTPS.

If you are using Google App Engine (GAE) Flex, where the `secure:` directive is not available, I have found that one effective method to detect and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS is by checking the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO` header. The following condition can be used to ensure the request is made over HTTPS:

```python
if request.environ.get('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO') != 'https':
    # Invalidate or redirect the request
```

Could you please confirm if this approach is suitable for my use case? Any additional insights or best practices would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
