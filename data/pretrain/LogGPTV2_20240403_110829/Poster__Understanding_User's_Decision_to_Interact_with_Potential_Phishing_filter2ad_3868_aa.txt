Abstract
Facebook remains the largest social media platform on the Internet
with over one billion active monthly users. A variety of personal
and sensitive data is shared on the platform, which makes it a prime
target for attackers. Increasingly, we see phishing attacks that take
advantage of users’ lack of security knowledge, deceiving victims
by using fake or compromised accounts to share malicious posts.
These attacks may slip undetected by the Facebook defense sys-
tem, exposing users to potentially be phished or have their devices
infected with drive-by downloads and malware. Only a few stud-
ies have been conducted to date to understand how users interact
with attacks like this in Facebook. In our prior work, we conducted
a study to address this challenge using a simulated interface and
think-aloud protocol. In this study, we aim to make further progress
in understanding the impact of different factors on users’ clicking
decision in social media through a vignette study that encourages
participants to think about realistic scenarios that they might face.

1 Introduction
Social media platforms like Facebook have become an integral part
of life for billions of people. Unfortunately, many users lack the
awareness and skills to use these sites securely [3, 5, 13]. Recently,
there has been an increase in phishing attacks on social media sites
using fake or compromised accounts [4, 9, 10]. In social media,
attackers can improve their chance of getting users to click on the
links through targeted attacks that exploit the personal information
that users share on the site. Although a targeted attack requires
more time and effort, it can be more successful and harder to detect
both by current defense systems [15] and by users.
To date, there has been a little research aimed to understand the
efficacy of attackers’ strategies in carrying out phishing attacks
in social media, which is important to investigate for improving
both defense mechanisms and user awareness. This study extends
upon our previous work [12] on this research goal. Our prior work
used an interface prototype for an in-person lab study with a think-
aloud protocol to understand users’ clicking behavior, where the
prototype resembles the Facebook newsfeed interface. The interface
had details such as post author’s profile picture and the post preview
details replaced with placeholders to remove personal bias. The post
author’s name was also replaced with a label of the relationship
between the user and the post author (e.g. "close friend"). In this
way, we created an artificial Facebook interface for a study in a
controlled setting.
The study we now report on in this paper is motivated in part
by the feedback that we received on the previous work concerning
the artificiality and unfamiliarity of the simulated interface used
for the study. To this end, we used a vignette study, in which we
presented participants with verbal details and asked them to use
their imagination to create the corresponding scenario in their mind.
Using these vignettes also allowed us to explore more scenarios
than our prior work [12], contributing to a deeper understanding
of users’ clicking behavior in social media.

2 Related Work: Phishing in Social Media
Phishing in email has a very low rate of success, with just 3% of
users clicking on links for emails that make it to their inbox [14].
In social media, however, 25% of users click on malicious links [8].
This raises the question of why the success rates of attacks are
so high in social media. Alam et al. [1] noted that the success of
PosterCCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom2617targeted phishing is correlated with the amount of information the
attacker has. Therefore, if an attacker can become a friend with
the victim or uses a compromised account of a friend of the victim,
he will have little difficulty in fooling the victim without getting
noticed. Social media users expose a lot of personal information
through the site, particularly to their connections, so this likely
aids attackers.
Another reason that the attacks are successful is due to how
Facebook is used. Joinson [6] found that some Facebook users gain
gratification from the site by either social surfing, finding more
information about other people, or expanding their social network.
To find others and be found, users may fill out information on their
profile and tailor their privacy settings to reach a wider audience. By
doing so, these users are providing more information to the phishing
attackers and exposing themselves as vulnerable targets. Lampe et
al. [7] noted that there is a correlation between the completeness
of profile details and the amount of online friends.
Additionally, users who are receptive to new connections may
also be vulnerable to accepting friend requests and messages from
attackers posing as legitimate users. Furthermore, users with large
amount of friends may be more vulnerable to interacting with
unknown strangers or unaware that their friends’ accounts have
been compromised. Vishwanath [15] performed a study in which
he made friend requests and requests for private information using
fake Facebook profiles. He found that habitual users of Facebook are
more likely to both accept the fake friend requests and give up their
private information than less frequent Facebook users. Patil [11]
conducted a study of fake accounts in social networking sites (SNS)
in 2012, in which they find that up to 40% of users would accept
a fake account request. Boshmaf et al. [2] developed the Socialbot
Network, a group of adaptive social bots that tricked up to 80% of
Facebook users into accepting their friendship requests.
With all of these factors taken together, the high success rates
reported for phishing through social media platforms may be con-
sidered unsurprising.
Other than our own prior work [12], however, we have not found
any study on whether users treat links from these fake accounts
the same as those from accounts connected to them based on rela-
tionships that extend beyond Facebook. Furthermore, no studies
that we know of examine whether and how users are looking for
indicators of compromised accounts or fake posts.
3 Methodology
We conducted the vignette study in a lab setting, as approved by
the Institutional Review Board at Rochester Institute of Technology.
The participants completed a survey hosted on the Qualtrics plat-
form after they had read and agreed to informed consent document.
In contrast to our previous work [12], this study used vignettes
to investigate users’ clicking behavior in different scenarios. Each
vignette presented a unique combination of the variables that we
explored: relationship between the post author and the participant,
the location of the post, and the type of post.
Each vignette presents one combination of values for each vari-
able. The values for the relationship between the post author and
the participant are: Spouse/Partner, Close Friend, Acquaintance,
and Public Page. There are four different values for post location:
the participant’s wall, the post author’s wall with the participant
tagged, the post author’s wall without the participant tagged, and
the participant’s messenger inbox. The values for the types of post
include: Interactives (e.g. quizzes), Sales-Oriented, and Media.
We had a total of 48 different vignettes considering all combina-
tions of values for the variables. Instead of tiring out the participants
with questions about all 48 vignettes, two of the four relationships
were randomly selected for each participant. Therefore, each par-
ticipant needed to respond to 24 individual vignettes. For each
relationship, the participants were asked to provide a pseudonym
to be used in the vignette to encourage familiarity, as well as some
information about the person’s Facebook usage behavior as ob-
served by the participant in real life. For example, if a participant
provided a pseudonym of "Tom" for her Spouse, a vignette was pre-
sented to the participant as following: "Scenario 1: Tom has shared
a post on your wall. It’s an interactive post (e.g. quizzes, games)."
Then the participant was asked about how often she encounters
this scenario in real life and how likely she is to click on that post.
