Subject: Seeking Advice on Managing CPU Quota Limits for My Twitter App on App Engine

Hello,

I am new to Google App Engine and have recently deployed a web-based Twitter application. However, I've been consistently exceeding my daily CPU quota limits. After some profiling, I discovered that each request to my app involves two `urlfetch` queries, each taking up to 2 CPU seconds. The rest of the processing, including interactions with the Datastore, is completed in under 200 milliseconds. Given that my free quota is 6.5 CPU hours per day, and each request consumes approximately 4 CPU seconds, I found myself exhausting the free quota in just a few hours this morning.

Since I cannot control the response time from Twitter's API and caching is not feasible due to the unique nature of each request (each one pertains to a different Twitter profile), I am looking for suggestions on how to optimize my application or manage my quotas more effectively.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

### Suggested Solution

To address your issue, you may want to consider the following design changes:

1. **Offload Requests to the Client-Side**:
   - If possible, perform the requests to Twitter directly from the user's browser using JavaScript. This way, the load is shifted from your server to the client, reducing the number of `urlfetch` calls made by your App Engine instance.

2. **Store and Cache Responses**:
   - After performing a `urlfetch`, store the Twitter API response in the Datastore. Subsequent requests can then retrieve this data instead of making another call to Twitter. This approach leverages the faster access times of the Datastore.
   - For even better performance, use Memcache to cache the responses. Memcache is designed for fast, in-memory storage and can significantly reduce the latency and CPU usage associated with frequent `urlfetch` calls.

3. **Regularly Update Stored Data**:
   - Use cron jobs and the task queue to periodically update the stored data. This ensures that the information remains current without the need for real-time `urlfetch` calls for every request.

By implementing these changes, you can reduce the CPU load on your App Engine instance and stay within your quota limits more effectively.

I hope these suggestions are helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
