User: Hey. I'm quite new to App Engine. I created a web-based Twitter app which is now running on App Engine and I'm constantly hitting my CPU Over Quota limits. I did a little profiling and I found out that every request consists of two urlfetch queries, each one of which takes up to 2 CPU seconds. That time is probably spent waiting, all the rest of the code is done in under 200 ms (including work with the Datastore). The Quota is for 6.5 hours per day and every request of mine takes approx. 4 CPU seconds. I ran out of the free quota this morning in only a few hours.
What is the way around this? I can't make Twitter respond to my API calls quicker, and I cannot cache the results, since every request is for a different Twitter profile.
Any help is appreciated,
Thanks!
Assistant: You should change the design of your application.
Instead of making requests to Twitter from App Engine for every user request:

Do the request in the user's browser with JavaScript if possible.
After a urlfetch, store Twitter's response in the datastore, since a call to the datastore is faster on the next request. If you can cache something in memcache, even better.
Update the stored data regularly with the help of cron jobs and task queue.
