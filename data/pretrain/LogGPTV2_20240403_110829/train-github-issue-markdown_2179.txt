Julia offers several settings that can be controlled through environment variables. However, many of these settings are not documented in the official manual. Based on a preliminary review of the Julia base code, the following environment variables appear to be available for configuration:

- `JULIA_HISTORY`
- `JULIA_CPU_CORES`
- `JULIA_LOAD_PATH`
- `JULIA_WORKER_TIMEOUT`
- `JULIA_EDITOR`
- `JULIA_SHELL`
- `JULIA_DEBUG_LOADING`
- `JULIA_INPUT_COLOR`
- `JULIA_ANSWER_COLOR`
- `JULIA_ERROR_COLOR`
- `JULIA_WARN_COLOR`
- `JULIA_INFO_COLOR`
- `JULIA_STACKFRAME_LINEINFO_COLOR`
- `JULIA_STACKFRAME_FUNCTION_COLOR`

These environment variables allow users to customize various aspects of Julia's behavior and appearance.
