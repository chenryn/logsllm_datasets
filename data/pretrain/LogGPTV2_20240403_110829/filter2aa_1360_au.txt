Next, we can download and configure all custom Windows scripts, shortcuts, icons, and tools with the following 
commands within Command Prompt.
• cd %userprofile%\Desktop
• curl —u osint9:bookl43wt -0
https://inteltechniques. com/osintbook9/windows-files. zip
• curl -u osint9:bookl43wt -0
https: //inteltechniques. com/osintbook9/tools. zip
• unzip tools.zip -d %userprofile%\Desktop
• unzip windows-files.zip -d %userprofile%\Documents
• del windows-files.zip tools.zip
• choco install python3 youtube-dl yt-dlp googlechrome ffmpeg httrack 
exiftool exiftoolgui ripgrep vic tor-browser googleearthpro keepassxc 
mediainfo git curl unzip wget phantomjs streamlink firefox sed -y
Next, we can install our basic applications, such as Firefox, Chrome, and others with the following command. 
You could eliminate any apps which are undesired, but this demonstration requires all programs listed within 
the command.
During the Mac setup, we used Brew as a package manager for the basics. For Windows, we will use Chocolatey. 
It can be installed with the following steps. Ever}' command in this section, including any updates, can be found 
at https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/windows.txt
• 
Click the Windows menu button (lower-left) and type "cmd".
• 
Right-click on Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator".
• 
Enter the following command into Command Prompt.
• 
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\vl. O\powershell.exe" 
NoProfile -InputFormat None -Executionpolicy Bypass -Command " 
[System.Net .ServicePointManager] ::Securityprotocol = 3072; iex ((New- 
Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadstring 
(’https://chocolatey.org/install.psl'))" && SET
"PATH=%PATH%; %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
During installation, you might be prompted to accept all defaults. Type "A" and strike enter if this occurs. You 
must reboot after the previous step is complete! Next, we can configure Firefox as described in Chapter 
Three with the following steps.
• 
Open Firefox, close it, and enter the following in Command Prompt.
• cd %userprofile%\Downloads\
• curl —u osint9:bookl43wt -0 https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/ff- 
template.zip
• unzip ff-template.zip
• cd %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\
*.default-release
• xcopy /Y /E %userprofile%\Downloads\ff-template\*
• 
Open Firefox, close it, reopen, and confirm extensions and settings.
Let's start building our Windows OSINT host. Ideally, you will be creating this machine from a new \ in ows 
installation, but it should also work with existing builds. You may want to practice with a Windows rst in 
order to ensure you want these changes applied to your current machine. The following steps generate numerous 
modifications to your Windows operating system and should not be executed without serious considerauon.

Finally, we can install all of the Python OSINT tools which were c---------
with the folloxring commands. Note that these entries must be within a Command Prompt launched 
"Administrator".

Mac & Windows Hosts 111
You may have noticed that I replicated all of die Pip installations with both "py" (Python 3.10) and "python 
(Python 3.9). This is because some applications work better with one version over the other. If you encounter a 
program which fails, open the corresponding script and change "py" to "python" within that instruction (or vice 
versa). Unlike Linux and Mac, Windows does not include Python by default, and forcing Python programs to 
function through manual installation can be tiresome. This is a "cheat" which may solve your own issues down 
the road.
You can now drag and drop the files within your Documents\windows-files\shortcuts folder anywhere you like, 
including another folder or the Desktop. In Figure 6.03, you can see that I placed them all within my Desktop 
for easy access. You can drag and drop each for desired arrangement. I decided to place all of my shortcuts 
across the bottom of the screen. You may prefer them to be tidy within a folder. These are shortcuts whic 
launch the batch files included within your download. I used shortcuts because I can customize them with 
specific icons and folder paths to match our needs. For the same reasons cited within the Mac section, 1 not 
offer a single installation command for Windows. Please conduct all steps manually.
