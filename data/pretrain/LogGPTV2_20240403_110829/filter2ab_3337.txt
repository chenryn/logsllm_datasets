### Description
To manage the security of individual COM (Component Object Model) applications, you can modify the registry settings either directly or by using the `dcomcnfg.exe` tool. Specifically, these modifications can be made in the following registry paths:

1. **Process-Wide Security for Individual COM Applications:**
   - **Registry Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID\{AppID_GUID}`
   - **Purpose:** This path is used to configure the security settings that apply to a specific COM application. Each COM application has a unique AppID GUID, which is used to identify and apply the appropriate security settings.

2. **System-Wide Security Defaults for All COM Applications:**
   - **Registry Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ole`
   - **Purpose:** This path is used to set the default security settings that apply to all COM applications that do not have their own process-wide security settings. These defaults ensure that a consistent security policy is applied across the system, unless overridden by more specific settings.

By modifying these registry keys, you can control the level of access and permissions granted to COM applications, thereby enhancing the overall security of your system.
