I'm planning a small, quick side project and am considering using the Google App Engine, as it supports Python and has Django integrated. This seems like a good opportunity to explore this platform. However, I have a few questions:

1. Has anyone used the Google App Engine for projects beyond simple, toy problems? I've seen some well-constructed example applications, which suggests it might be suitable for more substantial projects, but I would appreciate hearing about real-world experiences.
2. Are there any specific success stories or cautionary tales that you can share regarding the use of the Google App Engine?

The idea of "App Engine running Django" can be a bit misleading. While the App Engine does support Python, it replaces the entire Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer with its own datastore. This means you'll need to familiarize yourself with the App Engine's datastore, which requires a different approach to data modeling and management. Be prepared to invest some time in understanding these differences.
