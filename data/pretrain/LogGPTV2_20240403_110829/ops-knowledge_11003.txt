User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unable to Access Share on Windows 2008 I have a Windows 2008 server (Standard, with SP2).

Windows Firewall is OFF

File sharing is ON

Password protected file sharing is ON

I am unable to access my C: drive share either from the local console or from a remote machine. 

This is what happens when I log in from the local console:

If I click Start -> Run and enter \MyMachineName and press enter, an Explorer window opens showing my share "C" and "Printers". 

If I double click on "C", I get a message saying "Windows cannot access \MyMachineName\C". If I click the "Diagnose" button, it says ""MyMachineName" is not set up to establish a connection on port "File and Printer Sharing (SMB)" with this computer.

Any ideas how to solve this?

Assistant: I'm not sure if that's a typo up there, but have you tried \\servername\c  ?

Also, try \\servername\c$ and supply creds and see if you can access the admin share.
