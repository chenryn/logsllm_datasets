**Florian Rampp** opened **SPR-7383** and commented
The current implementations of ClientHttpRequestFactory (besides
SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory) only comprise CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory,
which depends on Jakarta Commons HttpClient. The successor of this is Apache
HttpComponents. See: http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/#History
It would be desirable to employ the newer HttpComponents HttpClient.
Therefore, an implementation of ClientHttpRequestFactory for usage with the
HttpComponents HttpClient is necessary.
This issue might be related to http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SWS-563.
