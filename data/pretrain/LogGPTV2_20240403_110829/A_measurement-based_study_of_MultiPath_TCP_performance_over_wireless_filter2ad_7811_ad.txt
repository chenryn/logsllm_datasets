4.2 Large Flow Measurements
In this section, we present results for larger ﬁle sizes (e.g.,
8 MB, 16 MB, and 32 MB). For comparison purposes, we
also include 4 MB downloads with the other three large ﬁle
sizes made during the day of our measurements. Our goal
is to evaluate the behavior of MPTCP when subﬂows leave
their slow start phases, and the MPTCP congestion con-
troller takes over the connection and performs congestion

5. LATENCY DISTRIBUTION
In previous sections, we focused mainly on the perfor-
mance of MPTCP in terms of download times. For mo-
bile users, however, low download time does not necessarily
guarantee a high quality of experience. When using the In-
ternet, users do more than simply fetching and viewing Web
pages. Users often consume real-time applications, such as
video streaming (e.g., Youtube, Netﬂix) or interactive ser-

vices (e.g., Facetime, Skype). These applications require
stable network service, i.e., low variability and jitter.
Although MPTCP provides robustness against time-varying
path quality, the impact to MPTCP connection quality re-
mains unclear when another cellular/WiFi path is being ex-
ploited for MPTCP. In the following sections, we ﬁrst char-
acterize path latency (in terms of packet round trip times)
of each cellular carrier and the Internet service provider,
and try to understand the impact of using heterogeneous
networks. More importantly, we investigate how leveraging
path diversity might introduce latency to application per-
formance, which can directly aﬀect user experience.
5.1 Packet Round Trip Times
We reported average RTTs (and their standard errors) of
single-path TCP connections over cellular and WiFi paths
as indications of path quality in previous sections. Here, we
investigate RTTs at a ﬁner granularity by focusing on the
distributions of packet RTT for each ﬁle download size, and

RTT with log scale (milliseconds)
Figure 12: Packet RTT distributions of MPTCP
connections using WiFi and one of the three cellular
paths.
the RTT measurements are on a per-ﬂow basis. The RTT is
calculated as deﬁned in Section 3.3. For each MPTCP con-
nection, we record the RTT value of each packet if an ACK
is received by the server for a particular packet, excluding
retransmitted and timed out packets.
Note that the RTT traces are collected from the measure-
ments described in Section 4, where the default coupled con-
gestion controller is used. We then aggregate all the packet
RTT traces over the course of 24 hours, and group them by
interfaces (cellular and WiFi) and ﬁle sizes. In addition, we
only report on ﬂow sizes larger than 512KB, as some carriers
have large RTTs and hence the cellular path does not carry
any traﬃc when ﬁle sizes are smaller than 512KB.
Figure 12 presents the Complementary CDF (CCDF) plot
of ﬂow RTTs for diﬀerent transfer sizes carried via diﬀer-
ent cellular/WiFi providers across all MPTCP connections.
Note the the ﬁgure is in log-log scale to better visualize the
tails.
Two clear behaviours are observed here. The WiFi path,
on average, has lower and less variable RTTs than cellular
paths. The minimum WiFi RTTs across diﬀerent ﬁle sizes
are about 15 ms, while 90% of packet RTTs are less than 50
ms for ﬁle sizes larger than 4 MB.
Cellular networks, on the other hand, have quite diﬀerent
RTT patterns than the WiFi network. The AT&T LTE
path exhibits a minimum RTT of about 40 ms, and more
than 70% of the RTT samples lie between 50 and 200 ms.
The Sprint 3G network, on the other hand, has a minimum
RTT of about 50 ms, but with more than 98% of the RTT
samples larger than 100 ms, and the value could ﬁve-fold
large when ﬁle sizes are 4-8 MB. If the transferred ﬁle size
is as large as 16 or 32 MB, packet RTTs can be as large as
2 seconds.
Despite being based on LTE, the Verizon network, has an
RTT distribution pattern that lies in between the patterns of
both AT&T and Sprint. Its minimum RTT is 32 ms, which
is smaller than AT&T’s, but the RTT value can extend up
to two seconds.
In all, packet RTTs over cellular networks have quite dif-
ferent patterns than conventional WiFi networks. Cellular
networks exhibit larger minimum RTTs and higher RTT
variability. The phenomenon of having inﬂated and vary-
ing RTTs over cellular networks is commonly termed as
buﬀerbloat [9], and the root cause of this issue is the pres-
ence of huge buﬀers in the networks (routers at edge net-
works or in the cellular networks). Our measurements con-
ﬁrm results from previous studies by Allman [1] and Jiang
et al. [15], which show that buﬀerbloat is less prominent
in residential/non-residential networks (ex: private/public
WiFi networks), and can be very severe in 3G/4G cellular
networks.
When a MPTCP connection includes a path that has
highly variable RTTs, that path can aﬀect the overall MPTCP
performance. This is mainly because for large RTT values,
if the RTT values increases over time, it takes longer for
the MPTCP congestion controller to update its estimated
RTT and will delay the congestion controller’s response to
the large latency. The MPTCP congestion controller can
hence underestimate the targeted throughput and lead to
performance degradation. Since this issue is more related to
path characteristics, we leave this for future work.
5.2 Out-of-order Delay
Our results in Section 4 show that MPTCP performs com-
parably to its best single-path TCP counterparts over any of
the available paths, and sometimes performs slightly better.
We measured the download time of a ﬁle and showed the
results for diﬀerent ﬁle sizes. However, in practice many ap-
plications are sensitive to the network quality (e.g., low RTT
or jitter variation) rather than download time or through-
put (as long as it satisﬁes the operational conditions). When
the path characteristics (e.g., loss rate or RTT) are diverse,
reordering delay becomes crucial as packets arriving early
from one path need to wait for packets arriving late from
another path. From our measurements, this happens very
often when the paths have very diﬀerent RTTs. In this case,
the fraction of the traﬃc carried by the slow path (e.g., a 3G
path) is very small, while the majority of packets arrive over
the fast path, but are out-of-order in data sequence number.
These packets arrive at the receive buﬀer as a burst, but will
not be delivered to the application until the packets arrive
from the slow path. In our testbed, the receive buﬀer is con-
ﬁgured to be large enough so that there is no limitation due
to the receive window, and thus we can measure the exact
delay caused by reordering.
Figure 13 shows CCDFs of out-of-order delay using three
diﬀerent MPTCP conﬁgurations: AT&T/WiFi, Verizon/WiFi,
and Sprint/WiFi. Note the time axis in the ﬁgure is in log
scale so as to better visualize the tail. Table 6 shows the av-
erage and standard errors for RTTs and out-of-order delay
of MPTCP connections.
MPTCP with AT&T 4G, and MPTCP with Verizon 4G in
general do not suﬀer much from out-of-order packets. 75%
of the packets are delivered in order (in terms of global data
sequence numbers). However, transfers of of smaller ﬁles
(4MB and 8MB) tend to exhibit larger out-of-order delay.
This might be explained by their RTT distributions, where
4MB and 8MB ﬂows tend to have higher RTTs. Thus, when
a packet is out-of-order, it needs to wait for the later arriv-
