User: Please explain the role of each layer in the TCP/IP protocol stack and their interaction process.
Assistant: The TCP/IP protocol stack consists of four layers, which are link layer, network layer, transport layer and application layer. Their functions and interaction processes are as follows: 1. Link layer The link layer is responsible for transmitting data from one network device to another A network device uses physical addressing between layers, that is, MAC address. The link layer implements the encapsulation and decapsulation of data packets, and is the most basic level of network communication. 2. Network layer The network layer is the core to realize the interconnection of network media, which can transmit data between network segments, and the protocols used include IP, ICMP and so on. The network layer implements the routing, grouping and reassembly of data packets. Each device has its own IP address for addressing during data transmission. 3. Transport layer The transport layer is responsible for dealing with the transmission of data in the network to achieve reliable transmission. The protocols used include TCP and UDP. The transport layer implements the segmentation of data packets. The transport layer provides end-to-end services (between two devices). The sender segments the data and transmits these segments to multiple destinations. The receiver is responsible for reassembling the data. . 4. Application layer The application layer provides specific application protocols, including HTTP, FTP, etc. The role of the application layer is to implement a specific application program, and the application layer data is inserted into the data segment of the transport layer in the form of a message. The interaction process between the layers is as follows: 1. The application layer packs the data into a message and passes it to the transport layer; 2. After the transport layer receives the data, it divides it into several segments, and adds a TCP to each segment. 3. The network layer adds an IP header in front of the data segment of the transport layer through the IP protocol, including source and destination IP addresses, and passes it to the link layer; 4. Chain After the road layer receives the data, it will add the header and tail of the data link layer, and transmit the data to the destination in the form of network media (such as LAN or WAN); 5. After the destination device receives the data, the link The data link layer deletes the header and tail of the data link layer and transmits it to the network layer. The network layer judges its address and network segment, and after routing, passes the data to the transport layer; 6. The transport layer uses the serial number in the TCP header and confirmation number, etc., reorganize the segmented data and pass it to the application layer.
