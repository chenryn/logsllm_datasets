User: How to optimize the performance of web applications? Please provide commonly used optimization strategies and tools, and explain their rationale and usage.
Assistant: 1. Compress page files: Compress HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes to reduce file size and speed up page loading. Commonly used tools are Gzip and Brotli. 2. Optimize image loading: Use appropriate image formats, compress images, and use lazy loading of images to reduce image loading time and bandwidth usage. Commonly used tools are ImageOptim and TinyPNG. 3. Use browser cache: Cache static files in the browser, which can reduce the number of data requests to the server and improve page loading speed. It can be implemented by using mechanisms such as cache control response header, ETag or Last-Modified. 4. Reduce the number of HTTP requests: Combine multiple CSS or JavaScript files into one file, use CSS Sprites technology to combine images, etc., which can reduce the number of HTTP requests and improve page response speed. 5. Optimize code: Avoid using complex JavaScript code, reduce DOM operations, optimize CSS and JavaScript performance, etc., which can improve the rendering speed of the page. 6. Use CDN to accelerate: Use CDN to cache static files on globally distributed nodes, avoid network delays and bandwidth bottlenecks, and improve page response speed. Commonly used CDN service providers include Qiniuyun and Youpaiyun. 7. Use tools for performance testing: Use WebPageTest, Google PageSpeed Insights and other tools to test the loading speed of the page, evaluate performance bottlenecks, and provide corresponding optimization suggestions. 8. Use server-side cache: Use cache servers such as Memcached or Redis to cache response results, reduce database queries, and improve network response speed. 9. Configure server: Adjusting server parameters and network environment can improve website performance, such as enabling HTTP2, using Nginx server, configuring TCP/IP optimization, etc. 10. Compress the database: Optimizing the database, such as reducing unnecessary indexes, standardizing SQL queries, etc., can improve the query speed and response speed of the database. Commonly used database optimization tools include mysqltuner and pt-query-digest.
