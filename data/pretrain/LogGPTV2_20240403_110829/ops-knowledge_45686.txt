User: How to implement code merging and conflict resolution under Git version control?
Assistant: 1. Through the Git command line or graphical interface, modify and submit the code locally, and synchronize it to the remote warehouse. 2. If multiple people are making code changes in the same code base, you can use Git branches to avoid conflicts. Everyone can make code modifications in their own branch, and conduct code review and testing before merging into the main branch. 3. When multiple branches need to be merged, you can use the Git merge or Git rebase command. Merge will create a new merge commit that merges the changes of the two branches together; Rebase will rebase the changes of one branch to the top of the commit of the other branch, forming a more concise commit history. 4. Code conflicts may occur during merging. Git will give a conflict prompt, use an editor to manually resolve the conflicts locally, and then submit the changes to the warehouse. 5. If there is a problem after the merge, you can use the Git reset or Git revert command to roll back the commit history to avoid the release of wrong code.
