### Provable Robustness Results

**Table 5: Clean accuracy of ResNet and BagNet for different datasets**

In this subsection, we present provable robustness results for our defense, computed using Algorithm 2 and Theorem 1. These results hold for any attack within the corresponding patch size constraint. We also compare PatchGuard with previous provably robust defenses [9, 28, 59].

#### Key Findings:
- **High Provable Robustness Across Models and Datasets:**
  - Both Mask-BN and Mask-DS achieve high provable robustness.
  - For example, against a 1% pixel patch on the 10-class ImageNette dataset, Mask-BN has a provable robust accuracy of 89.0%, while Mask-DS has 83.1%. This means that for 89.0% and 83.1% of the images from the respective test sets, no attack using a 1% pixel patch can succeed.
  - Even for the challenging 1000-class ImageNet dataset, Mask-BN achieves a non-trivial provable robust accuracy of 32.3% for the 1% pixel patch, which increases to 54.8% for the top-5 classification task (see Appendix D for more details).

- **High Clean Accuracy:**
  - PatchGuard retains high clean accuracy. For a 1% pixel patch, Mask-BN has a 95.2% clean accuracy on ImageNette and 55.1% on ImageNet. Mask-DS has a 92.3% clean accuracy on ImageNette and 44.1% on ImageNet.
  - For a 2.4% pixel patch on CIFAR-10, Mask-BN and Mask-DS have a high clean accuracy of 83.9% and 84.6%, respectively.
  - Table 5 shows that the clean accuracy drop of Mask-BN and Mask-DS on ImageNette compared to undefended ResNet is within 7.5%. The accuracy drop of Mask-BN from the undefended BagNet is within 1%.

- **Comparison with Previous Defenses:**
  - **IBP [9]:** IBP is computationally expensive and does not scale to high-resolution images like ImageNette and ImageNet. On CIFAR-10, both Mask-BN and Mask-DS significantly outperform IBP in terms of provable robust accuracy and clean accuracy.
  - **CBN [59]:** Both Mask-BN and Mask-DS have higher provable robust accuracy than CBN across three datasets. For example, against a 3% pixel patch on ImageNette, Mask-BN (94.8%) has a similar clean accuracy as CBN (94.9%), but its provable robust accuracy is 37.1% higher.
  - **DS [28]:** Both Mask-BN and Mask-DS perform better than DS on high-resolution datasets like ImageNette and ImageNet. For example, against a 1% pixel patch on ImageNet, Mask-BN has a 10.7% higher clean accuracy and a 14.6% higher provable robust accuracy compared to DS.

- **Takeaways:**
  - Our evaluation shows that our proposed defenses achieve state-of-the-art provable robustness on all three datasets.
  - BagNet-based defenses (Mask-BN and CBN) perform well on ImageNette and ImageNet but are less effective on CIFAR-10 due to low image resolution.
  - De-randomized Smoothing based defenses (Mask-DS and DS) perform better on CIFAR-10.
  - While robust masking always improves robustness, the choice between Mask-BN and Mask-DS depends on the dataset.

### Detailed Analysis of PatchGuard

#### 5.3.1 Analysis of Vanilla Models

PatchGuard’s robust prediction relies on clipping feature values and robust masking. Here, we show that vanilla models only experience a small performance loss due to clipping and feature masking, which explains the high clean accuracy retained by PatchGuard.

- **Clipping Impact:**
  - Varying the clipping value for the local logits of ResNet and BagNet shows that clipping negative values slightly affects clean accuracy. Decreasing the positive clipping value also decreases clean accuracy.
  - Models with smaller receptive fields are more sensitive to clipping because they rely on large logit values for correct predictions. Figure 3 illustrates that adversarial images tend to have large logit values. Setting the positive clipping value to the largest clean logit value improves empirical robustness without affecting clean accuracy.

- **Feature Masking Invariance:**
  - Vanilla models are generally invariant to feature masking. We use BagNet-17, which has 26×26 local features, to analyze prediction invariance to partial feature masking.
  - Table 7 shows that the overall average masked accuracy is high, and the percentage of images and windows for which the prediction changes is low, enabling high provable robustness and maintained clean accuracy.

#### 5.3.2 PatchGuard with Different Parameters

- **Receptive Field Size:**
  - The receptive field size balances the trade-off between clean accuracy and provable robust accuracy. Table 8 shows that a larger receptive field (e.g., Mask-BN-33) has better clean accuracy but a larger gap between clean and provable robust accuracy.
  - Careful balancing of the receptive field size is necessary when deploying the defense.

- **Detection Threshold:**
  - A large detection threshold improves clean accuracy but decreases provable robust accuracy. Table 9 shows the effect of different detection thresholds on Mask-BN-17.

This detailed analysis provides insights into the effectiveness and behavior of PatchGuard, highlighting its superior performance in terms of provable robustness and clean accuracy across various datasets and model configurations.
