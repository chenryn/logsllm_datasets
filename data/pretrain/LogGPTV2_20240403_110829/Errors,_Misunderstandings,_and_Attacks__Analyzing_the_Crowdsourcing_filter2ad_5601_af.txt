### 3. Data Selection and Limitations

We prioritized the accuracy of the analysis over the scale of the data. Although the sample size is smaller, it remains highly diverse, encompassing a wide range of reporter types, editors, website types, and website ranking ranges. The Internet Archive imposed a limitation on our ability to extract data from web pages that were not archived. A similar constraint is mentioned in [41].

### 4. Focus on Ad-Blocking Filter Lists

Our work primarily focused on the ad-blocking filter list and its weaknesses. Other types of filter lists, such as reputation-based blacklists used for blocking unsolicited emails and phishing blacklists, share some of these weaknesses. For instance, Sinha et al. [69] highlighted significant false positive errors in reputation-based blacklists. Similarly, Sheng et al. [67] noted that heuristic-based phishing detection often takes a long time to appear on blacklists. Investigating the lifetime of false positives in other filter lists is part of our future research plans.

### 5. Related Work

In this section, we briefly discuss related works in two categories: issues related to crowdsourcing and the analysis of the ad-blocking ecosystem.

#### 5.1 Crowdsourcing Accuracy and Security Issues

Recent research on crowdsourcing quality has primarily focused on systems in fields such as information retrieval [35], financial incentives [43], labeling [42, 68], natural language [9, 70], and geographic information [23]. Many studies aim to enhance the accuracy and quality of crowdsourcing [4, 8, 37â€“39, 42]. For example, Le et al. [39] suggested training the crowd to improve their performance.

#### 5.2 Analysis of Ad-Blocking Systems and Filter Lists

The relationship between Internet users, ad publishers, and ad blockers has been extensively studied from various angles. One perspective examines the interactions between ad blockers and websites [51, 53, 89]. Zhu et al. [89] introduced a differential execution analysis method to detect and analyze anti-ad blockers. Another angle, explored by Pujol et al. [60], analyzed the interactions between Internet users who use ad-blocking software and the ad ecosystem. Vratonjic et al. [78] investigated the business model consequences of ad blocking on websites, while Miroglio et al. [48] examined the effects of ad blocking on Internet users.

Regarding filter lists, Wills and Uzunoglu [87] studied third-party domains in filter lists and proposed ways to improve ad-blocking tools. Walls et al. [82] examined the EasyList whitelist, and Gervais et al. [25, 46] investigated privacy filter lists to study tracker-blocking methodologies. Our approach complements existing works by providing a deeper analysis of the accuracy of filter lists.

### 6. Conclusion

This paper presents an in-depth study of the behavior of the ad-blocking system and its community using two longitudinal datasets. The key findings are:
1. False positives in ad-blocking systems using filter lists are non-trivial.
2. A large number of false positive errors have long lifetimes and occur across a wide range of websites due to various reasons.
3. The mechanism for handling false negative errors has deficiencies and weaknesses.
4. The system has many vulnerabilities that impact its accuracy.

The paper identifies 15 different ways to circumvent the system. We hope these findings will guide future work to improve ad-blocking and optimize crowdsourcing mechanisms.
