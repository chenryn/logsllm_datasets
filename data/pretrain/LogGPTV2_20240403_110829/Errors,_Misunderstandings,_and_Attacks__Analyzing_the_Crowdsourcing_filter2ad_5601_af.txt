the scale of the data and the accuracy of the analysis. We chose
the latter. Although the scale is smaller, the samples are still very
diverse, covering different reporter types, editors, websites types,
and website ranking ranges. Finally, the Internet Archive limited
us from extracting data from web pages that were not archived. A
similar limitation is indicated in [41].

ter list and its weakness. Other types of filter lists share with ad-
blocking filter list some of the weaknesses. For example, Sinha et.
al. [69] illustrated that the reputation-based blacklist, namely those
used to block unsolicited emails, have considerable false positive
errors. Another example is the phishing blacklists. Sheng et. al. [67]
stated that phishing detection by heuristics took a long time to ap-
pear on blacklists. However, studying the lifetime of false positives
in other filter lists is a plan for our future work.
7 RELATED WORK
In this section, we briefly discussed the related works in the follow-
ing two categories: issues related to crowdsourcing, and analyzing
the ad-blocking ecosystem.
Recent re-
Crowdsourcing Accuracy and Security Issues.
search about crowdsourcing quality is mainly about the systems
in the following fields: information retrieval [35], financial incen-
tives [43], labeling [42, 68], natural language [9, 70] and geographic
information [23]. There are also many works which attempt to en-
hance the accuracy and quality of crowdsourcing [4, 8, 37–39, 42].
For example, Le at al. [39] suggested training the crowd.
The re-
Analysis of Ad-blocking Systems and Filter Lists.
lationship between Internet users, ad publishers, and ad block-
ers has been studied by substantial research from different angles.
One angle is the reaction between the ad blockers and the web-
sites [51, 53, 89]. For instance, Zhu at el. [89] presented a differential
execution analysis method to detect and analyze anti-ad blockers.
Another angle was studied by Pujol et al. [60], who analyzed the
interactions between Internet users who use ad-blocking software
and the ad ecosystem. Vratonjic et al. [78] have investigated the
consequences of ad blocking on the websites from the perspective
of a business model, while Miroglio et al. [48] have investigated the
effects of ad blocking on Internet users.
As to Filter Lists, Wills and Uzunoglu [87] have studied the
third-party domains of filter lists and suggested ways to improve
ad-blocking tools to prevent requests to a different type of these
domains. The whitelist of EasyList were studied by Walls et al. [82].
The privacy filter lists have been investigated on a high level by
Gervais et al. [25] and [46] in order to study tracker-blocking
methodologies. Our approach is complementary to existing works:
We conducted a deeper analysis of the accuracy of filter lists.

8 CONCLUSION
This paper presented an intensive study of the behavior of the ad-
blocking system and its community using two longitudinal datasets.
The central conclusions are (1) false positive in ad-blocking systems
using filter list is non-trivial, (2) a large number of false positive
errors have long lifetimes that occurs in a wide range of websites as
a consequence of many reasons, (3) the mechanism of dealing with
false negative errors has some deficiencies and weaknesses, (4) the
system has many vulnerabilities impacting its accuracy. The paper
presented the vulnerabilities by exhibiting 15 different ways to
circumvent the system. We hope the findings build lighthouses for
any future work to evolve ad blocking and optimize crowdsourcing
mechanisms.
