### ATT&CK ID: T1547.013
### ATT&CK Technique Name: XDG Autostart Entries

Adversaries may modify XDG autostart entries to execute programs or commands during system boot. XDG (X Desktop Group) compliant Linux desktop environments support the use of XDG autostart entries, which allow applications to automatically start after a user logs in to the desktop environment.

By default, XDG autostart entries are stored in the following directories:
- System-wide: `/etc/xdg/autostart`
- User-specific: `~/.config/autostart`

These entries are typically defined in `.desktop` files, which contain configuration information for the application, including the command to be executed and any additional parameters.
