User: A quick question for Python 2.7
Are global variables visible to a subprocess?
Can a subprocess change the values of global variables?
Many thanks.
Assistant: No, global variables are not visible to a sub-process. Variables are private to each process. If you want to share variables then you need to use some form of inter-process communication.
