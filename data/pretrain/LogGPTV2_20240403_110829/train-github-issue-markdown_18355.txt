When I close an unsaved file, I get a popup saying "foo has changes, do you
want to save them?". The popup has three buttons "Save", "Cancel" and "Don't
Save".
The standard Windows dialog for this allows me to hit n to select Don't Save.
WIBNI Atom would allow me to do the same, at least on Windows?
