User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I protect myself from false accusations when our company practices password escrow? During an internship for a small company, my boss created an account for me, so I generated a password and I used it. The next day, my boss told me to write down the password of my account on a piece of paper, put it in a letter and to sign the envelope. Then he took the letter and told me that if he needs to access my account and I am unreachable, he is authorized to open the envelope and read the password to use it.

He also told me that this is a common practice in all companies. Now I don't know if every company does this (I don't think so) but, to me, it's not legal.

Let's say that my boss is a bad person (he's not) and he wants to frame me for something that he did. He only has to open the letter and read my password (let's say that I'm unreachable) and do his nefarious activity with my account.

Now let's say that I can't prove my innocence. How I can prevent all of this?
I thought of writing down a wrong password, but if he really needs my account and I'm unreachable, I'll put him in a bad situation.

So, is there a way to protect myself (without refusing to write down the password)?

Assistant: That's what the envelope is (or should be) for: In order to use your password, one needs to break the seal of the envelope you signed. When you think your password was abused, you can ask to see the envelope with your signature and check if it is still unopened.

All you need to do is that should your management ever require your password, change the password and hand in a new envelope. You might want to change your password in regular intervals anyway: It's common best practice.

By the way: In companies with a proper IT management this method is unnecessary, because system administrators can receive any necessary information from user accounts without having to know the passwords of the user. If an administrator really needs to log into a user account, they would reset the password (which would create a verifiable audit trail). And there is usually more than one system administrator, so the admin accounts do not require this method either.
