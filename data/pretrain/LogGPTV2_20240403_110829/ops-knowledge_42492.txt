User: I need to execute several shell scripts with python, some scripts would export environment parameters, so I need to execute them in the same process, otherwise, other scripts can't see the new environment parameters
in one word, I want to let the shell script change the environment of the python process
so I should not use subprocess, any idea how to realize it?
Assistant: No, you cannot run more than one program (bash, python) in the same process at the same time.  
But you can run them in sequence using exec in bash or one of the exec commands in python, like os.execve.  Several things survive the "exec boundary", one  of which is the environment block.  So in each bash script you exec the next, and finally exec your python.
You might also consider using an IPC mechanism like a named pipe to pass data between processes.
I respectfully suggest that you look at your design again.  Why are you mixing bash and python?  Is it just to reuse code?  Even if you managed this you will end with a real mess.  It is generally easier to stick with one language.
