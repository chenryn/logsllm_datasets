### EasyList and Anti-Adblock Filter Rules

**Introduction to EasyList:**
EasyList is primarily designed to block advertisements. By default, most major ad-blockers are subscribed to EasyList. Since 2011, EasyList has included specific sections dedicated to anti-adblock filter rules. This analysis focuses exclusively on these anti-adblock sections.

**Temporal Evolution of Anti-Adblock Rules:**
- **Daily Addition Rate:** On average, EasyList adds or modifies 0.6 anti-adblock filter rules per day.
- **Growth Over Time:** The list began with 67 filter rules in 2011 and expanded to 1,317 rules by July 2016.
- **Rule Types:**
  - **HTTP Request Rules:** There is a steady increase in the number of HTTP request filter rules. In the most recent version, 96.3% of the rules are HTTP request rules.
    - 64.6% of these rules have only a domain anchor.
    - 3.6% have only a domain tag.
    - 24.6% have both a domain anchor and tag.
    - 3.5% have neither a domain anchor nor a tag.
  - **HTML Element Rules:** Only 3.7% of the rules are HTML element rules, all of which include a domain.

### Comparative Analysis of Anti-Adblock Lists

**Combining EasyList and Adblock Warning Removal List:**
- **Reasons for Combination:**
  1. Both lists are managed by the EasyList project [16].
  2 . They are complementary: Adblock Warning Removal List contains mostly HTML element rules, while EasyList contains mostly HTTP request rules.
- **Combined List:**
  - The combined list contains 1,483 rules.
  - **Domain Coverage:**
    - Combined EasyList includes 1,394 domains.
    - Anti-Adblock Killer List includes 1,415 domains.
    - **Common Domains:** Only 282 domains are common between the two lists.

**Distribution of Domains:**
- **Alexa Popularity Ranks:**
  - Table 1 shows the distribution of domains across different Alexa rankings. The popularity distributions are fairly similar.
- **URL Categorization:**
  - We used McAfee’s URL categorization service [26] and merged similar categories.
  - Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of domains based on McAfee’s URL categorization, showing the top 15 categories and grouping the remaining as "Others."

**Exception and Non-Exception Conditions:**
- **Combined EasyList:**
  - Ratio of exception to non-exception domains: approximately 4:1.
- **Anti-Adblock Killer List:**
  - Ratio of exception to non-exception domains: approximately 1:1.

**Implementation Differences:**
- **Example of Exception Rule:**
  - Code 7 shows an example where /ads.js? is blocked globally but allowed on numerama.com.
  - Code 8 explains how numerama.com uses a bait HTTP request to detect adblockers.
- **Domain-Specific Rules:**
  - Code 9 and Code 10 illustrate the different approaches used by the Combined EasyList and Anti-Adblock Killer List for the same domain (yocast.tv and pagefair.com).

**Promptness in Adding New Rules:**
- **Comparison:**
  - 185 domains appear first in the Combined EasyList.
  - 92 domains appear first in the Anti-Adblock Killer List.
  - 5 domains appear on the same day in both lists.
- **Time Difference:**
  - Figure 3 shows the distribution of the time difference (in days) between the addition of rules targeting overlapping domains in the two lists.
  - The Combined EasyList is generally more prompt in adding new rules, likely due to its larger user base and earlier start date.

### Analyzing Filter List Coverage Using the Wayback Machine

**Retrospective Study:**
- **Objective:**
  - To study the evolution of anti-adblock prevalence on popular websites.
- **Data Collection:**
  - We use the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine [38], which has archived 279 billion web pages since 1996 [40].

**Methodology:**
- **Crawling Process:**
  - We crawl one snapshot per month for each of the Alexa top-5K websites over the last five years.
  - **Wayback Availability JSON API:**
    - Used to collect URLs for monthly archives.
    - Discard outdated URLs and partial snapshots.
  - **Parallel Crawling:**
    - Use 10 independent browser instances to speed up the process.
- **Handling Missing Snapshots:**
  - Figure 5 shows the timeseries of missing monthly snapshots, indicating a decrease from 1,524 in August 2011 to 984 in July 2016.
  - Most missing snapshots are due to outdated URLs, which decreased from 1,239 to 532 over the same period.

**Conclusion:**
- **Key Findings:**
  - Significant differences in the implementation and promptness of adding new rules between the Combined EasyList and Anti-Adblock Killer List.
  - The Combined EasyList is more prompt, possibly due to its larger user base and earlier start date.
- **Future Work:**
  - To fully understand the behavior of these filter lists, it is necessary to run them on actual websites and observe how different filter rules are triggered.
