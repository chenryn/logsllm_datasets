Some useful tips about the self-check
• 1 point if you do nothing without considering the item
• 1 point if you do not know the item or do not think about it
• The score changes depending on your position
– Rate these items as you think to visualize differences between 
positions
• Self-check is to visualize things you did not know or could 
not do, so do not be afraid to rate a low score

The characteristic of analysis results by this tool
• Immediately after the staff changes, the score is often low
• If the operators and the engineers is self-checking, the score 
often lower.  If the managers and the leaders self-checking, 
the scores often higher
• Outsourced services have higher scores
