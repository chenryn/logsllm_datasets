# Insource or Outsource Patterns
ISOG-J "Handbook for Security Response Organization (SOC/CSIRT)"

# Strength of Security Response Organization
The strength of a security response organization is determined by its ability to continuously perform each role effectively.

# Measuring Your Security Response Organization
**Security Response Organization Maturity Level Self-check Sheet**
- **ISOMM (ISOG-J SOC/CSIRT Maturity Model)**

# How to Use ISOMM
1. Understand the security response cycle, roles, and services.
2. Decide which roles and services you want to provide within your organization.
3. Know the current status of your insource/outsource style.
4. Determine the goal of your insource/outsource style.
5. Check the current status using the self-check sheet.
6. Decide what to improve based on the results.

# Scoring Chart
| Insourcing | Outsourcing |
|------------|-------------|
| 0 - Do nothing as a result of consideration | 0 - Do nothing as a result of consideration |
| 1 - Knowing and not doing, or not knowing anything | 1 - Not confirm the results and the reports, or not knowing anything |
| 2 - A few people can do operations, but not documented | 2 - Not understand the services and the results |
| 3 - Several people can do operations, but not documented | 3 - Not understand the services or the results |
| 4 - Team members can do operations by referring to documents | 4 - The service quality and benefits are lower than expected or not sufficient |
| 5 - Team members can do operations by referring to documents authorized by responsible persons (e.g., CISO, managers) | 5 - The services and the benefits are as expected, and confirm the reports and the results |

# Useful Tips for Self-Checking
- 1 point if you do nothing without considering the item.
- 1 point if you do not know the item or do not think about it.
- The score changes depending on your position.
- Rate these items as you think to visualize differences between positions.
- Self-check is to visualize things you did not know or could not do, so do not be afraid to rate a low score.

# Radar Chart: Scores of Each Role
ISOG-J "Handbook for Security Response Organization (SOC/CSIRT)"

# Characteristics of Analysis Results
- Immediately after staff changes, the score is often low.
- If operators and engineers are self-checking, the score is often lower. If managers and leaders are self-checking, the scores are often higher.
- Outsourced services have higher scores.

# Lightweight and Easy-to-Use Tool
- Anyone who belongs to a security organization can self-check the current status.
- Visualize gaps felt by the type of occupation or individual differences.
- Determine if there is a lack of service for security response in your organization.
- Compare with assessment results from third parties.
- No improvement can be made without checking the current status—use ISOMM!
