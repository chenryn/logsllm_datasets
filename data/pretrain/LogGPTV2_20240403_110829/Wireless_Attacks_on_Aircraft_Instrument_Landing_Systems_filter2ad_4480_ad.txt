in Figure 14 and Figure 15. We generated the single-tone
attack signal to cause full-scale deviation i.e., (cid:38) 2.5◦ for lo-
calizer and (cid:38) 2.5◦ for the glideslope while perfectly in sync
with the legitimate carrier signal. We observe that the phase
difference causes the resultant offset to change. We also noted
an uncertainty region around the 90◦ and 270◦ phase differ-
ence region. This is due to the dependency in a DSB-SC
system [26] between the carrier phase difference φ and the
resulting distortion at the output which is directly proportional
to the cosφ. Therefore, at angles around 90◦ and 270◦, there
is an uncertainty region for the resulting offset. However, in
our experiments on the handheld receiver, we noticed that

although the needle oscillated, it was not as pronounced as
the simulation results indicate. One of the reasons is the rate
at which the sensor measurements are being calculated and
displayed on the screen. Additionally, the aircraft is in motion,
therefore, causing the phase differences to cycle more rapidly
than the display’s refresh rate. A knowledgeable attacker can
potentially leverage these properties to generate controlled
spooﬁng signals and succeed with an optimized transmission
power.
4.3.2 Real-time Amplitude Scaling
In the following, we propose and evaluate a strategy to counter
the effect of phase synchronization on the single-tone attack.
It is clear that the phase differences cause the output to be
distorted. Besides the uncertainty region around the 90◦ and
270◦, it is possible to predict the phase given sufﬁcient knowl-
edge such as aircraft speed, current location, and antenna
positions. We assume such a motivated attacker for the single-
tone attack evaluation in this section. It is also well known
that tightly controlling the phase of a signal is not trivial and
therefore our algorithm proposes to manipulate the amplitude
of the attacker signal instead of the phase. Changing the am-
plitude of the attacker signal will compensate for the effect
of phase on the signal at the receiver and we call this “real-
time amplitude scaling” algorithm. The algorithm itself is
inspired from prior works on amplitude scaling for DSB-SC
systems [26]. We use the distance between the transmitter
and the receiver to estimate the received phase of the signal
by measuring complete and incomplete wave-cycles. In the
simulation, we then create an ILS signal with the necessary
phase shift. We also create the attacker’s signal and add it
to the legitimate signal to estimate the DDM. This allows
us to assess the impact of phase on the transmitted signal
and use this information to calculate the amplitude that will
be required to counter the effects of phase. For example, if
the predicted phase offset is zero, then to spoof a certain off-
set, the attacker needs to reduce the amplitude of its signal.
We present the results of our amplitude scaling experiment
in Figure 16 and Figure 17.
4.4 Comparison of Power Requirements
One of the major advantages of the single-tone attack is the im-
provement over the power required to execute the attack, given
sufﬁcient knowledge and environmental conditions. In this
section, we evaluate and compare the power requirements of
the overshadow and the single-tone attacks. We note that the
absolute power proﬁles are speciﬁc for the handheld receivers
used in the experiments. The goal of the power comparison is
to verify whether there is indeed an improvement in terms of
attacker’s required transmission power. We present our results
in Figure 18 and Figure 19. Our evaluations show the required
signal strength to successfully cause 0.5◦ and 0.1◦ deviation
in localizer and glideslope respectively. The received signal
strength proﬁle is shown in blue acts as a reference for the
attacker based on which the attacker can compute its required
power to transmit the spooﬁng signals. We performed the ex-
periment by transmitting the signals to the handheld receiver
and observing the success of the attack (needle indicating
the intended offset). The values are a result of over 400 trials
with 95% conﬁdence interval and we ﬁnd that on an average
the difference in power required reaches close to 20.53 dB
and 27.47 dB for the localizer and the glideslope respectively.
Thus, given sufﬁcient knowledge of the scenario, a motivated
attacker can execute the single-tone attack successfully and
with less power than the overshadow attack. We acknowledge
that the single-tone attack has its drawbacks as described
previously, however, we note that given the low power re-
quirements, an attacker can exploit the single-tone attack to
cause a low-power denial of service attack. Such an attack,
especially in an aircraft’s ﬁnal moments before landing can
be disastrous.

5 Discussion
Receiving antenna characteristics and location of the at-
tacker. The receiver hardware and its characteristics4 vary
depending on the type of aircraft it is mounted on. For ex-
ample, Cessna aircraft have their ILS antennas on the tail-ﬁn
or the vertical stabilizer. We note that the same antenna is
typically used for a number of systems such as VOR, ILS,
and DME; each signal arriving from a different direction. For
commercial aircraft, the antennas are typically located on the
nose of the plane with a forward-looking single broad lobe
receiving beam pattern. Certain large aircraft, speciﬁcally
those capable of landing with high nose attitude, the antennas
are located either on the underside or on the landing gear of
the aircraft itself 5. The antenna equipment onboard plays an
important role in determining the optimum location of the
attacker to execute the attack. The ideal location of an on-
ground attacker is at a point along the centerline of the runway

Attackers inside the plane will have to deal with signal atten-
uation caused by the body of the aircraft itself and position
the spooﬁng signal transmitter accordingly. A thorough inves-
tigation is required to fully understand the implications and
feasibility of an on-board attacker and we intend to pursue
the experiments as future work. The location of the attacker
plays a more signiﬁcant role in the scenario of the single-tone
attacker since the attacker has to carefully predict the phase
and accordingly manipulate the amplitude of the spooﬁng
signal. The problem of identifying optimum locations for the
attack is an open problem very similar to the group spooﬁng
problem [56] proposed as a countermeasure for GPS spooﬁng
attacks. In our context, the attacker has to identify locations
on the ground such that the phase difference between the legit-
imate signal and the spooﬁng signal remains a constant along
the line of approach. Recall that in the single-tone attack, the

and therefore locations that allow constant phase differences
can result in a ﬁxed spooﬁng offset and therefore minimal
oscillations in the readings.
ILS Categories. The main advantage of ILS is that the
pilot need not have visuals of the runway during the ﬁnal
approach as the ILS system is intended to guide the aircraft
to a safe landing. The ILS categories are classiﬁed based on
the maximum decision height at which a missed approach
must be initiated if the pilot does not have a visual reference
to continue the approach. In CAT I the decision height is at
60 m above the ground i.e., if the pilot does not have a visual
reference at this height, a missed approach or go around must
be initiated. The decision height for CAT III is as low as 15 m
above the ground. The demonstrated attacks can cause severe
consequences in CAT III systems due to the low decision
height. It might potentially be too late to execute a missed
approach in case of an attack. The consequences of the attack
on CAT I and CAT II systems are less catastrophic. However,
they can still cause major air trafﬁc disruptions. Note that
CAT I approach is mostly used by smaller ﬂights. Commercial
ﬂights typically ﬂy a CAT II or CAT III approach.
Alternative technologies and potential countermeasures.
Many navigation technologies such as HF Omnidirectional
Range, Non-directional Beacons, Distance Measurement
Equipment and GPS provide guidance to the pilot during the
different phases of an aircraft’s ﬂight. All the mentioned navi-
gation aids use unauthenticated wireless signals and therefore
vulnerable to some form of a spooﬁng attack. Furthermore,
it is worth mentioning that only ILS and GPS are capable of
providing precision guidance during the ﬁnal approach. Also,
ILS is the only technology today that provides both lateral
and vertical approach guidance and is suitable for CAT III
ILS approaches.
Most security issues faced by aviation technologies like
ADS-B, ACARS and TCAS can be ﬁxed by implementing
cryptographic solutions [50] [52]. However, cryptographic
solutions are not sufﬁcient to prevent localization attacks.
For example, cryptographically securing GPS signals [24, 33]
similar to military navigation can only prevent spooﬁng at-
tacks to an extent. It would still be possible for an attacker
to relay the GPS signals with appropriate timing delays and
succeed in a GPS location or time spooﬁng attack. One can
derive inspiration from existing literature on mitigating GPS
spooﬁng attacks [30, 31, 34, 35, 46, 56] and build similar sys-
tems that are deployed at the receiver end. An alternative is
to implement a wide-area secure localization system based
on distance bounding [19] and secure proximity veriﬁcation
techniques [45]. However, this would require bidirectional
communication and warrant further investigation with respect
to scalability, deployability etc.
Experiment Limitations. Our experimental setup de-
scribed in Section 4 was carefully constructed in consultation
with aviation experts. Since we use an FAA accredited ﬂight
simulator, we sent our conﬁguration ﬁles and scripts to a li-
censed pilot for them to perform ﬁnal approaches using the
instruments and give us feedback. We were mainly concerned
whether there was any other indicator on the cockpit that
raises suspicion about the attack. We conducted our attack
evaluations in both wired and controlled wireless settings.
Note that it is illegal to transmit ILS signals over the air in a
public space. Effects due to aircraft’s motion such as Doppler
shift do not affect the attacker signal as these are receiver
end problems and the receiver hardware already accounts
for such effects for the legitimate signal. Note that the at-
tacker closely imitates the legitimate signals in frequency and
amplitude. In short, we made the best effort to replicate a
real-world approach. However our setup has its limitations.
We did not perform the experiments on a real aircraft which
would give us more insights on the effects of aircraft’s con-
struction, antenna placements, cockpit display sensitivity, etc.
One of the factors that will get affected is the power required
by the attacker. Note that commercial ILS transmitters use a
25 watts transmitter for localizer signals and a 5 W power for
the glideslope signals. To put things in perspective, a standard
12 V 10 Ah battery can power a 24 Watts ampliﬁer for about
5 hours. Furthermore, we are in touch with a leading aircraft
manufacturer for access to such an experiment. We also note
that we are in the process of acquiring IRB approval to recruit
commercial pilots and studying their response to the attack
proposed in this paper.
6 Related Work
Over the years, the aviation industry has largely invested and
succeeded in making ﬂying safer. Security was never con-
sidered by design as historically the ability to transmit and
receive wireless signals required considerable resources and
knowledge. However, the widespread availability of power-
ful and low-cost software-deﬁned radio platforms has altered
the threat landscape. In fact, today the majority of wireless
systems employed in modern aviation have been shown to be
vulnerable to some form of cyber-physical attacks. In this sec-
tion, we will brieﬂy describe the various attacks demonstrated
in prior work. Strohmeier et al. [53] provide a comprehensive
analysis of the vulnerabilities and attacks against the various
wireless technologies that modern aviation depends on. Voice
communication over VHF is primarily used to transfer infor-
mation between the air trafﬁc controller and the aircraft. There
have already been incidents [51] related to spoofed VHF com-
munications and several efforts [23] to design a secure ra-
dio communication system. Primary surveillance radars have
been shown to be vulnerable to signal jamming attacks [40].
Secondary surveillance radars [6] leverage the ability of the
aircraft to respond to ground-based interrogations for aircraft
localization. Due to the unauthenticated nature of these mes-
sages, it is possible for an attacker to use publicly available
implementations for software-deﬁned radio platforms to mod-

ify, inject and jam messages creating a false picture of the
airspace. Such attacks where even demonstrated to be low-
power, targeted, and stealthy against sophisticated wireless
systems such as Wi-Fi [59], and WPA-Enterprise [21]. The
ADS-B protocol used by aircraft to transmit key informa-
tion such as position, velocity and any emergency codes also
face the same challenges of active and passive attacks due
to the unauthenticated nature of the signals. Several works
have repeatedly demonstrated the vulnerabilities of ADS-B
signals [7, 18, 22, 38, 47, 48, 52, 54, 60]. ACARS [5], the data
link communications system between aircraft and ground
stations was found to leak a signiﬁcant amount of private
data [36,50,55] e.g., passenger information, medical data and
sometimes even credit card details were transferred. Further-
more, an attacker can spoof TCAS messages [42, 48] creating
false resolution advisories and forcing the pilot to initiate
avoidance maneuvers. For navigation, the aviation industry
relies on a number of systems such as ILS, GPS, VOR, and
DME. Although the use of VOR and DME are rapidly de-
creasing, ILS and GPS will be in use for a very long time
and are the only technologies available today for enabling
autonomous landing. It is also well established that GPS is
vulnerable to signal spooﬁng attacks [11,13,32,39,41,56,61].
Researchers have also demonstrated [43, 44] the feasibility of
signal manipulation in the context of data communication sys-
tems. However, there has been no prior work on the security
guarantees of ILS and this paper is a work in that direction.
It is important to note that although many of the security is-
