competition, namely XLANG (Thatte 2001) from
Microsoft and DAML-S from DARPA. In particular,
DAML-S (DAML-S 2001) currently includes constructs
to specify QoS parameters, such as quality guarantees,
quality rating, and degree of quality. While DAML-S has
identified specification for Web service and business
processes as a key specification component, the QoS
model adopted should be significantly improved to supply
a more complete solution.
Maintainability
The QoS model presented in this paper can be extended in
two additional dimensions which are useful for SoM
applications with stronger requirements. The first
dimension is maintainability. Maintainability corresponds
to the mean time necessary to repair failures; it is the
