##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
win_chocolatey
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
2.4.2.0
##### SUMMARY
A single double quotes are ignored:
    - name: Install ImageMagick
      win_chocolatey:
        name: imagemagick.app
        install_args: "/DIR=\"{{ ansible_env['ProgramFiles'] }}\\ImageMagick\""
A working workaround is:
    - name: Install ImageMagick
      win_chocolatey:
        name: imagemagick.app
        install_args: "/DIR=\"\"{{ ansible_env['ProgramFiles'] }}\\ImageMagick\"\""
This seems like a bug as single double quotes are ignored (checked against
chocolatey log), but they should be probably double somewhere in the module.
