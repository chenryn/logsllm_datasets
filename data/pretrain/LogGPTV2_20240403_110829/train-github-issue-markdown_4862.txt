Thanks for next.js , I think it's awesome and has enabled me to progress a
universal website much quicker than I could of done trying to build it out
from scratch!
I have added an entry point in my config for a component that ends up in the
/static folder, this is a script that I am loading onto a script tag on
componentDidMount and accessed via a Web Worker:
    const { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer')
    const { ANALYZE } = process.env
    const path = require('path');
    module.exports = {
      webpack: function (config) {
        console.log(config);
        if (ANALYZE) {
          config.plugins.push(new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
            analyzerMode: 'server',
            analyzerPort: 8888,
            openAnalyzer: true
          }))
        }
        return Object.assign({}, config, { entry: function() {
          return config.entry().then((entry) => {
            return Object.assign({}, entry, { '../static/components/canvasAnim.js': './components/CanvasAnim'})
          })
        }})
        return config;
      }
    }
My script is working in dev, but when I build it does not seem to get touched.
I was expecting this to end up all minified. So when I run the code in prod,
React complains with: Error: Minified React error #130;
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I don't think I am describing a bug here, probably something I am missing
around the way next.js config works!
## Current Behavior
During build the entry does not seem to be touched.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Add an entry point that maps to static and then build
