User: If you have a script open in the Windows version of R, you can run a line (or section of highlighted code) in the shell by hitting CTRL-R (believe it's command-enter in apple version). Is there similar functionality for IDLE? Many thanks
Assistant: No
In the shortcut key list in IDLE, in Options > Configure IDLE > Keys, in the Action - Key(s) list, one does not find any shortcut key for executing selected code.
