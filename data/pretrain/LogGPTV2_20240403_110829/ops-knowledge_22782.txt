If you are using the Windows version of R, you can execute a single line or a highlighted section of code in the shell by pressing `CTRL+R` (on macOS, it is `Command+Enter`). Is there a similar functionality available in IDLE?

**Response:**

No, IDLE does not have a built-in shortcut key for executing selected code. You can verify this by checking the list of shortcut keys in IDLE: go to `Options > Configure IDLE > Keys`, and review the "Action - Key(s)" list. There, you will find that no specific shortcut is assigned for running selected code.
