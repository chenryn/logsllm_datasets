User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where'd my Solaris task bar go? I've got a user here that has a curious problem.  Upon login, he gets a "Unable to open panel because the panel is already open" error message.  His session does not display a task bar, but otherwise works just fine!  No errors (other than the usual that everybody gets) in the .dt logs.  Double ctl-alt-backspace doesn't help.  No one else on the machine has the problem.  Seems like something that a reboot probably wouldn't fix (and a reboot would be highly disruptive as it's a busy machine with many users).  Prefer not to have to delete/recreate his account.  Any ideas on how I might fix it?

Assistant: The way I would go about tracking this would be to rename/move the ~/.dt .gnome .gnome2 etc. files. They get recreated when the user logs in if they are missing.
