Mozilla Thunderbird can be configured to use GnuPG on all 
major platforms through installing the Enigma add-on, which 
adds OpenPGP message encryption and authentication to the 
Thunderbird e-mail client. It features automatic encryption, 
decryption, and integrated key management functionality.
Note! You can direct your Thunderbird e-mails through the Tor Network by using 
an extension for mozilla Thunderbird called TorBirdy. according to its creators 
(it belongs to the Tor project), TorBirdy is still in beta release and should not be 
used to secure communications in extremely hostile environments. You can 
find information on how to install and use this extension at https://trac.
torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy.
A browser extension is available for both Firefox and Google Chrome called 
Mailvelope that can be used with most web e-mail services. It allows its users to 
exchange encrypted e-mails using the OpenPGP encryption schema. You can either 
generate your key pair or import existing one (for example, from Kleopatra). You can 
use this extension without installing any tools except the extension on your browser. It 
is open source and available at https://www.mailvelope.com/en. However, we do not 
recommend encrypting messages within web browsers because this will make them 
more vulnerable to cyberattacks that regularly hit browsers.
 Secure E-mail Providers
If you prefer to use a webmail for some of your tasks, it is advisable to use a secure end- 
to- end e-mail provider that offers extended security features for your e-mail account. For 
instance, ProtonMail (https://protonmail.com) is different from other regular e-mail 
providers in many ways. It is based in Switzerland and follows its jurisdiction, which is 
considered the best one in the world in terms of protecting user privacy. ProtonMail uses 
two passwords to protect your e-mail account. The first one authenticates your account 
credentials on the server, and the second decrypts your inbox within your web browser 
or app, meaning that it never goes online to the ProtonMail server. If you are exchanging 
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS

e-mails with another ProtonMail user, you can safely set your emails to destroy itself 
within a time limit in addition to sending encrypted e-mails to other ProtonMail users. 
It is especially useful to destroy sensitive e-mails automatically on both sides of the 
communications.
Finally, if you want to use an e-mail for only one time (for example, to activate some 
services anonymously), you can go with any of the following two services:
• 
https://hidester.com/temporary-email
• 
https://www.guerrillamail.com
 Secure IM and Online Calling Services
IM conversations are another form of communications that you may need to protect. 
No one can guarantee that giant IT providers that offer free IM, voiceover IP, and video 
conference services do not log your chat—or at least the metadata of the conversation 
such as date/time and login IP address—for some period. We cannot discuss the security 
features of each available application in this book. However, we will focus on the security 
feature that makes one application more secure than the rest. For instance, most VoIP and 
chatting applications work the same way. They encrypt the messages exchanged between 
the people involved in the conversation, but they do not encrypt the message metadata.
The best secure VoIP/IM application is one that has the following technical 
characteristics: it should be open source so its code can be audited by independent 
security experts, it should not offer/show ads or any type of commercial advertisements, 
the provider and hence the app should not store the decryption key on its server so no 
one can request the key to decrypt user data, it should not store any metadata about the 
user connection, and the user contact list should not be stored on the app server and if 
necessary it should be saved encrypted. It should offer clear options to choose what you 
want to backup before sending it to the cloud provider.
The following are some popular secure and well-supported messaging apps:
• 
Tor Messenger (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/
wiki/doc/TorMessenger): Although it still in beta version, this is 
considered the best secure IM chat. Traffic is directed through the Tor 
Network for maximum anonymity.
• 
Cryptocat (https://crypto.cat/security.html): This is an open 
source secure messaging application, it encrypt all communication 
by default and allows for secure sharing of files online.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS

• 
Signal (https://whispersystems.org): This is a secure messaging 
and VoIP app; it is easy to use and offers similar functions as 
WhatsApp and Viber Apps. This app runs on Android and iPhone 
devices only.
• 
Ghost Call (https://ghostcall.io): This is an end-to-end encrypted 
calling service.
• 
ChatSecure (https://chatsecure.org): This IM program works only 
on iOS when it is configured to use OTR over XMPP.
 Virtualization Technology
Use virtualization technology to enhance your privacy and protect your host machine 
from malware and other security threats. A virtual machine allows you to have a virtual 
operating system that behaves like a full, separate computer. You can use virtual 
machines to execute programs, open e-mail attachments, test programs, and visit 
dangerous websites safely without being afraid of malware affecting your operating 
system because the virtual machine will run in a sandbox isolated entirely from its host 
machine’s operating system. Online investigators can use virtual machines to conduct 
their online investigations securely, and they can use freshly installed browsers to mask 
their digital fingerprint, making it appear like millions of similar browsers. Finally, they 
can delete the entire virtual machine to clear any digital traces that may be left on the 
host machine!
These are the most popular two virtual machines:
• 
VMware Player (see Figure 2-28) (www.vmware.com/products/
player/playerpro-evaluation.htm)
• 
Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org)
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
87
You can also use portable programs that do not need to be installed to run. Such 
programs will usually leave a little trace on the host machine, but it is still considered a 
way to minimize your digital footprint online.
Using a bootable USB token or live CD/DVD when working on sensitive documents 
is also a great practice to hide your digital traces. Running the Tails OS (https://tails.
boum.org) in offline mode is a great practice. There are many tools that can help you to 
create a bootable USB/CD drive. The following are some of them:
• 
Windows USB/DVD download tool (https://wudt.codeplex.com)
• 
Rufus (https://rufus.akeo.ie)
• 
WinBuilder (http://winbuilder.net)

Windows To Go is a new feature available in Windows 10 (Enterprise and Education 
editions only). It allows you to run the complete Windows 10 Live feature from a USB 
drive without needing to install it on your computer’s hard drive. You can access this 
feature from Control Panel ➤ Windows To Go. This feature allows you to take your 
Windows box with you wherever you go, but bear in mind that some Windows 10 
features may not work when using the Windows To Go operating system.
 Android and iOS Emulator
An emulator allows you to run the Android application on your computer as if it were 
on your smartphone. There are numerous reasons why an online investigator may want 
this to happen; maybe he wants to test the functionality of a specific app or simply wants 
to gather some information using a feature that is available only for smartphone apps. 
The protective measures to stay anonymous can be implemented more easily when 
running such applications—using an emulator—on your computer rather than on your 
smartphone. For instance, using a VPN and accessing resources using Tor anonymously 
is more convenient using a computer with a mouse. The same can be achieved with 
smartphone apps when running on a computer using emulators. Here is a list of the 
most popular emulators for both Android and Apple OS:
• 
Andy (https://www.andyroid.net)
• 
ARChon (https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/
master/archon.md), Google Chrome
• 
MEmu (www.memuplay.com)
•

 Drawing Software and Data Visualization
Drawing software—including mind mapping—and other data visualization tools help 
online investigators visualize their findings, make search plans, and avoid forgetting 
something during the gathering process; they also present the final results in a clear 
manner. In this section, we will focus on the best free programs/services available for 
aiding OSINT investigators in completing their mission.
 Mind Mapping and Idea Generation Tools
When conducting OSINT gathering, it is better to use some tools to organize your 
findings. The following are some popular tools for drawing diagrams and charts, taking 
notes, and creating mind maps to visualize your results.
FreeMind
FreeMind (http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is the 
most popular free mind-mapping software. Using this tool, you can draw different 
diagrams that visually organize information.

Google Drawings
Google Drawings (https://docs.google.com/drawings/create) is a free cloud-based 
diagramming tool developed by Google.
 Note Management
Here are some tools for note management.
TagSpaces
TagSpaces (https://www.tagspaces.org) is an offline, open source, personal data 
manager that helps you organize files on your OS—Windows, Linux, Android, or Mac—
using tags and notes to files/folders.
KeepNote
KeepNote (http://keepnote.org) is an open source cross-platform program for 
organizing your notes and to-do list. You can attach different media—like such as and 
videos—to your note making it more informative.
 Data Visualization
Here are some tools for data visualization.
Microsoft Excel
This helps you to summarize large amounts of data and present it in charts/tables and 
other graphical visualizations. Microsoft Excel is proprietary software by Microsoft.
Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools

 Bookmarking
When working on collecting OSINT sources, you will encounter a large sum of useful 
online resources. To handle this large volume of data, you need a method or tool to 
organize your favorite web pages. All web browsers have a built-in feature to organize 
favorites; we already recommended Firefox as a preferred web browser for conducting 
OSINT searches. The built-in bookmarking organizer associated with Firefox is enough 
to organize your work. However, it is preferable to use it efficiently by associating your 
bookmarks (see Figure 2-29) with tags and grouping related bookmarks in one folder. 
Firefox also gives you the ability to export your bookmarks to an HTML file so that 
you can import this HTML file into another browser later. To export your bookmarks 
in Firefox, select Bookmarks ➤ Show All Bookmarks ➤ Import and Backup ➤ Export 
Bookmarks to HTML.
Figure 2-29. Organizing Firefox favorites
There are plenty of online bookmarking managers; however, we found storing 
bookmarks using online services is not a good thing for the secrecy of the OSINT 
investigation.

 Free Translation Services
During your OSINT searches, you will encounter useful resources in other languages 
that you do not understand—for example, Arabic. Online instant translation services 
offer a great aid to understand these foreign resources to add them to your case data. 
The following are some free translation services:
• 
Google Translate (https://translate.google.com)
• 
Bing Translator (https://www.bing.com/translator)
• 
Babylon’s Free Online Translation  (http://translation.babylon- 
software.com)
•

 Final Tips
Finally, we want to give you some tips for you to follow before you begin your online 
OSINT research.
 Use a False Identity to Register on Some Websites
While you are conducting your OSINT searches, some websites may require you to 
register or create a free account to use its service or to access some sections. Make sure 
not to use your real personal information; you should also have a specialized e-mail 
address (preferably on Gmail) for this issue with fake information. The same thing 
applies when opening fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social 
networks to conduct your OSINT searches.
Warning! Some social sites prohibit creating fake accounts; it is always 
advisable to read the rules before you sign up. However, for people working in the 
intelligence arena, it is unlikely that they will obey such terms!
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
93
A fake identity generator can generate everything you need to become a new digital 
citizen. This includes phone, website, e-mail, username, password, account security 
questions, fake credit card and Social Security numbers, occupation, company, physical 
traits, and more. Here is a list of the most popular identity generation websites:
• 
www.fakenamegenerator.com
• 
https://names.igopaygo.com/people/fake-person
• 
www.elfqrin.com/fakeid.php
 Be Anonymous
Enable your VPN service—or simply use the Tor Browser—before you begin your OSINT 
search. If you are not using Tor, make sure to use a virtual machine that has a freshly 
installed web browser within it to collect online resources. Make sure that your VPN 
connection is enabled for all applications installed on your machine including your 
virtual machine instance.
 Destroy Your Digital Traces Upon Finishing
Use virtual machines and browse the Web using Firefox incognito mode. Make sure 
to use tools such as BleachBit (https://www.bleachbit.org) to wipe clean your 
applications’ digital traces in addition to any remnants left on hard drive.
 Use Linux
Many powerful OSINT tools work on Linux-based systems. These tools are available 
on Kali Linux (the successor of Backtrack), although many of these tools have been 
imported into Windows. You can download Kali from https://www.kali.org and 
install it on a virtual machine. Mastering the Kali Linux distribution is essential for any 
penetration tester and digital forensic investigator. Kali comes equipped with a plethora 
of out-of-the-box security tools.

 Summary
In this chapter, we prepared the stage before you begin your OSINT search. We talked 
about different online threats and how you can counter them through security software 
as well as best practices when using computing devices. We covered some OS-hardening 
tips focusing on Windows as it is still considered to have the largest user base worldwide.
We talked about how online tracking works technically by listing its types and 
gave countermeasures to prevent outsiders from tracking your online activities. Then 
we moved on to talking about secure online browsing; we gave hardening tips for the 
Firefox browser as well as useful privacy add-ons. Using VPN to encrypt online traffic 
is important for any Internet user; we briefly described the concept of a VPN and proxy 
server and then gave important hints on how to use them safely to avoid leaking your 
real IP address without your knowledge even though you are using a VPN service. The 
anonymity section is essential before conducting OSINT searches; you should not do any 
OSINT search without activating an anonymity service or a VPN. We talked about using 
the Tor Browser to surf the Web anonymously. For people who live in extremely hostile 
environments, using the Tails OS—which directs all your Internet traffic through the Tor 
anonymity network—is strongly advisable.
Virtualization technology comes in handy when you want to test other applications 
or you want simply to cover your digital traces on the host machine. Virtual machines 
also help you to lower your digital footprint when conducting your research online as 
you can use a standard OS and web browser installation to make your search and finally 
delete the entire OS in one click.
This was a long chapter full of advice on how to deal with today’s online threats. 
Understanding online threats, countermeasures, and how to become anonymous 
online is essential before beginning your work to harvest OSINT resources online. The 
rest of the chapters in this book are dedicated to OSINT search techniques. In the next 
chapter, we will delve beneath the surface of the ordinary Internet to explore the hidden 
underground Internet, known as the deep web.

CHAPTER 3
The Underground Internet
How well do you know the Internet? Being a regular Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram 
user and knowing how to use Google to find stuff online will not make you a super 
Internet user because you are just scratching the surface of the Web. Most web content is 
hidden and needs special methods to access it.
According to Internet World Stats, the number of Internet users in the world on June 
30, 2017, has reached 3,885,567,619. (The world’s population is 7,519,028,970 people.i) 
This is a huge number, and it is predicted to increase to 4 billion Internet users by 2020. 
Most Internet users worldwide are using the surface web—also known as the ordinary 
Internet. Only a tiny percentage of Internet users use the other hidden layers of the 
Internet on a daily basis or have even heard about them!
In August 2017, the total number of live websites belonging to the surface web was 
1,800,566,882,ii while the estimated number of Tor websites on the darknet from March 
2016 to March 2017 was about 50,000 to 60,000. Despite the huge number of websites 
within the surface web, Their contents -which can be indexed by typical search engines- 
constitutes only 4 percent of the whole Web, while the rest belongs to the deep web 
portion (which includes the darknet).
In this chapter, we will introduce you to the terms deep web and dark web. Both 
terms are used to point to the part of Internet that is hidden from an ordinary Internet 
user’s sight and cannot be indexed by typical search engines. Deep web contents can be 
accessed using the regular HTTP/HTTPS protocol and typical web browsers; however, 
this is not the same for the darknet, which needs special software to access its contents. 
Before beginning our discussion, let’s first differentiate between the three terms—
surface, deep, and dark Internet.
96
 Layers of the Internet
Let’s begin with the ordinary Internet or the surface web. This is the portion of the Web 
that includes all the contents that are readily available to the public. Websites on the 
surface web can be indexed using regular search engines such as Google so a user can 
find them easily.
Search engine providers use software known as web crawlers to discover publicly 
available web pages. Crawlers work by clicking hyperlinks inside pages and then sending
