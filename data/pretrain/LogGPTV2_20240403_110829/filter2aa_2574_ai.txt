## Configuring Mozilla Thunderbird for GnuPG
Mozilla Thunderbird can be configured to use GnuPG on all major platforms by installing the Enigma add-on. This add-on adds OpenPGP message encryption and authentication to the Thunderbird email client, providing automatic encryption, decryption, and integrated key management functionality.

**Note:** You can route your Thunderbird emails through the Tor Network using the TorBirdy extension. According to its creators (part of the Tor project), TorBirdy is still in beta and should not be used for securing communications in extremely hostile environments. For installation and usage instructions, visit: [TorBirdy Documentation](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy).

## Mailvelope: Browser Extension for OpenPGP
A browser extension called Mailvelope is available for both Firefox and Google Chrome. It allows users to exchange encrypted emails using the OpenPGP encryption schema. You can either generate a new key pair or import an existing one (e.g., from Kleopatra). This extension does not require any additional tools beyond the browser extension itself. It is open source and can be found at: [Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com/en).

**Caution:** We do not recommend encrypting messages within web browsers due to their vulnerability to cyberattacks.

## Secure Email Providers
If you prefer to use webmail for some tasks, it is advisable to use a secure end-to-end email provider that offers extended security features. For example, ProtonMail (https://protonmail.com) is based in Switzerland and adheres to Swiss jurisdiction, which is known for strong user privacy protection. ProtonMail uses two passwords: one for account authentication on the server and another for decrypting your inbox locally, ensuring that the second password never goes online. If you are exchanging emails with another ProtonMail user, you can set emails to self-destruct after a specified time, in addition to sending encrypted emails. This feature is particularly useful for automatically destroying sensitive emails on both sides of the communication.

## Secure IM and Online Calling Services
IM conversations are another form of communication that may need protection. While most VoIP and chat applications encrypt the messages exchanged between participants, they often do not encrypt the metadata (e.g., date/time, IP address). The best secure VoIP/IM application should meet the following criteria:
- Open-source code for independent audits
- No ads or commercial content
- No storage of decryption keys on servers
- No storage of user connection metadata
- Encrypted contact lists if stored on the server

Some popular secure messaging apps include:
- **Tor Messenger**: Directs traffic through the Tor Network for maximum anonymity. (Beta version)
- **Cryptocat**: An open-source secure messaging app that encrypts all communication by default.
- **Signal**: A secure messaging and VoIP app available on Android and iPhone.
- **Ghost Call**: An end-to-end encrypted calling service.
- **ChatSecure**: An IM program for iOS when configured to use OTR over XMPP.

## Virtualization Technology
Virtualization technology enhances privacy and protects your host machine from malware. A virtual machine (VM) acts as a separate, isolated operating system, allowing you to execute programs, open email attachments, test software, and visit potentially dangerous websites without risking your host OS. VMs can be deleted to clear any digital traces.

Popular virtual machines include:
- **VMware Player**: [VMware Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player/playerpro-evaluation.htm)
- **VirtualBox**: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

You can also use portable programs that leave minimal traces on the host machine. Using a bootable USB token or live CD/DVD for sensitive documents is another effective practice. Running Tails OS in offline mode is highly recommended. Tools for creating bootable media include:
- **Windows USB/DVD Download Tool**
- **Rufus**
- **WinBuilder**

## Windows To Go
Windows To Go is a feature in Windows 10 (Enterprise and Education editions) that allows you to run a full Windows 10 environment from a USB drive. Access this feature via Control Panel > Windows To Go. Note that some Windows 10 features may not work in this mode.

## Android and iOS Emulators
Emulators allow you to run Android and iOS applications on your computer, which can be useful for testing or gathering information. They provide a convenient way to implement protective measures for staying anonymous. Popular emulators include:
- **Andy**
- **ARChon** (for Google Chrome)
- **MEmu**
- **MOBIONE STUDIO** (for Apple apps)

## Essential Prerequisites
This section lists supporting software and methods for preparing OSINT data into usable formats for further analysis.

### Drawing Software and Data Visualization
Tools for visualizing findings, making search plans, and presenting results clearly. Popular free tools include:
- **FreeMind**: A mind-mapping tool.
- **Story Map**: For creating timelines.
- **Visual Investigative Scenarios**: For investigative storytelling.
- **Apache OpenOffice Draw**: For technical and business process diagrams.
- **Google Drawings**: A cloud-based diagramming tool.

### Note Management
Tools for organizing notes and to-do lists:
- **TagSpaces**: An offline, open-source personal data manager.
- **KeepNote**: An open-source cross-platform note organizer.

### Data Visualization
Tools for summarizing and visualizing large amounts of data:
- **Microsoft Excel**: Proprietary software for data visualization.
- **Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT)**: Open-source reporting and collaboration tool.
- **Dradis CE**: An open-source reporting and collaboration tool for InfoSec professionals.

### Bookmarking
To manage a large volume of online resources, use built-in bookmarking features in web browsers like Firefox. Organize bookmarks with tags and folders, and export them to HTML for backup.

### Free Translation Services
Online translation services for understanding foreign language resources:
- **Google Translate**
- **Bing Translator**
- **Babylonâ€™s Free Online Translation**
- **Systranet**

### Final Tips
- **Use a False Identity**: When registering on websites, use fake personal information and a dedicated email address.
- **Be Anonymous**: Use a VPN or Tor Browser for anonymity. Use a virtual machine with a freshly installed browser for added security.
- **Destroy Digital Traces**: Use tools like BleachBit to wipe clean digital traces.
- **Use Linux**: Many powerful OSINT tools are available on Kali Linux, which is essential for penetration testers and digital forensic investigators.

### Summary
This chapter covers various aspects of online threats and countermeasures, including secure browsing, anonymity, and virtualization. Understanding these concepts is crucial before conducting OSINT searches. The next chapter will delve into the hidden layers of the Internet, known as the deep web.

### The Underground Internet
The Internet has multiple layers, including the surface web, deep web, and dark web. The surface web consists of publicly accessible and indexed content, while the deep web includes unindexed content and requires special methods to access. The dark web, a subset of the deep web, requires specific software like Tor to access. As of August 2017, there were approximately 1.8 billion live websites on the surface web, compared to 50,000 to 60,000 Tor websites on the darknet. Despite the vast number of surface web sites, only 4% of the Web's content is indexed, with the rest residing in the deep web.
