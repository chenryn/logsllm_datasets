On the other hand, for a receiver that is not located at
the desired service location, due to the lack of channel syn-
chronization, it will experience distorted received signals in
various shapes, and consequently the jamming signals can-
not cancel each other, yielding a low SNR at the undesired
location. In Section 6.2, we show how the channel distortion
aﬀects the SNR at the undesired location.
5. TOLERABLE TIME SHIFT
In the above discussion, we consider the ideal case where
the arrival signals are perfectly synchronized. In practice, as
mentioned, after clock and propagation synchronization, a
slight time shift may still exists among the received signals
due to the processing delay and synchronization imperfec-
tions. In the following, we identify the tolerable time shift,
within which received signals can achieve the constructive
interference to obtain a boosted SNR.
5.1 Impact of the Time Shift on SNR
SNR is the ratio of the received signal power to the noise
power. Because the noise power is independent from the
time shift, the received signal power remains as the key met-
ric to determine the SNR at the desired receiver. Lemma 1
gives the threshold of the time shift based on the received
signal power. Without loss of generality, we assume that
there are two arrival signals to facilitate the presentation.

signal respectively, and g(t) is the baseband signal. Typi-

cally, g(t) is a sine, cosine or rectangle wave [7]. Assume
g(t) = sin(2f0t), S(t) then equals to

and its power is A2

bring twice of the noise power to the receiver, the received

a boosted SNR (i.e., the constructive interference). Thus,
the tolerable time shift should be less than 1
so that

mission speed with the QPSK modulator, a tolerable time

6. SERVICE AREA SIZE
Because signals travel at the speed of light, it seems that
a small tolerable time shift may result in a large service area
(e.g. 50ns indicates a distance of 15m). In this section, we
attempt to obtain a ﬁne-grain service area using the channel
uncorrelation property, which states that two receivers will
observe diﬀerent channels from the same transmitter if they
are separate by a couple of wavelength away.
In particu-
lar, [9] indicates that a distance of half wavelength can lead
to uncorrelated channels. In the following part, we will in-
vestigate how uncorrelated channels aﬀect the boosted SNR.
6.1 Channel Uncorrelation Property
We ﬁrst describe the channel uncorrelation property and
explore the distance required to generate the uncorrelated
channels. Channel correlation coeﬃcient is normally used
to indicate the similarity between two channels. When two
channels are fully correlated, the coeﬃcient approximates
to 1; while when two channels are uncorrelated from each
other, the coeﬃcient is 0. Theoretically, the multipath chan-
nel is usually modeled as the Rayleigh fading channel [10].
In a rich, isotropic scattering environment, multipath com-
ponents arrive at the receiver from all the directions, and
the corresponding channel correlation coeﬃcient can be de-
scribed as a zeroth order Bessel function [11]: ρ(d, f ) =
J0(2πd/λ), where d is the distance between the receiver and
the eavesdropper, f is the carrier frequency of the signal, and
λ = c
f is the wavelength of the signal. When we substitute
d = λ
2 into this function, the channel correlation coeﬃcient
approximates to 0, which indicates that two channels are
uncorrelated.
In practice, [12] presents that a longer dis-
tance (e.g. a couple of wavelength) may be required to get
the uncorrelated channels when there are less scatterings.
6.2 Power Attenuation by the Channel Uncor-
relation
In this part, we discuss how the uncorrelated channels
aﬀect the boosted SNR. As mentioned earlier, channels ob-
297served by the eavesdropper are uncorrelated from the cal-
ibrated ones. Thus, channel eﬀects cannot be eliminated
and signals will exhibit diﬀerent shapes when they arrive at
the eavesdropper. Lemma 2 gives the SNR at the desired
location and undesired location respectively.
Lemma 2. The SNR at the desired location and the unde-
sired location are 4Ph·Pt
respectively,
where Pt is the transmit power of orignal signal, Nc is the
channel noise power, Pj is the jamming signal power and Ph
is the channel variance.

path channel is described as h(τ ) = (cid:80)L
Proof: Without loss of generality, we assume two trans-
mitters. The calibrated signals from two transmitters are
denoted as S1 and S2 respectively. Let Pt be the trans-
mit power for both signals. Assume the receiver observes
two channels h1(τ ) and h2(τ ). According to [1], Multi-
l=1 alejφl δ(τ − τl),
where al and ejθl are the amplitude attenuation and phase
shift of the signal copy that travel along the i-th path. At
time τl, channel h1(τl) and h2(τl) can be modeled as the
random variables with zero mean and a variance that is
usually denoted as Ph [13]. Thus, at this time, the re-
ceived signal is S1 · h1(τl) + S2 · h2(τl). Since the mean
value of the received signal is 0, we can get the eavesdrop-
per’s power by calculating its variance. Speciﬁcally, for
a random variable x with the zero mean, its power P =
Thus, Ps = V ar[S1 · h1(τl) + S2 · h2(τl)] = PtE[|h1(τl)|2 +
2|h1(τl) · h2(τl)∗| + |h2(τl)|2] = 2Ph · Pt + 2ρPh · Pt, where

notes the complex conjugate operator.
At the undesired location, the channels of two transmit-
ters are uncorrelated from each other. Thus, their coeﬃcient
ρ equals to 0 and the received power is Ps = 2Ph·Pt. On the
other hand, two channels observed by the desired receiver
are calibrated and are quite correlated with each other. So
their coeﬃcient ρ equals to 1 and thus the received power is
Ps = 4Ph · Pt.
The power of jamming signals can be derived in the same
way. Assume two calibrated jamming signals are denoted
as C1 and C2 (C1 = −C2) with the power Pj for each of
them. Assume the receiver observes two channels h1(τ ) and
h2(τ ). At time τl, the combined power of two jamming
signals is given by Pc = V ar[C1 · h1(τl) + C2 · h2(τl)] =
2Ph · Pj − 2ρPh · Pj. At the desired location, the receiver
observes two correlated channels. Thus, ρ equals to 1 and
the combined power equals to 0. At undesired location, two
channels observed by the receiver are uncorrelated. Thus,
ρ equals to 0, and the combined power equals to 2Ph · Pj,
which can signiﬁcant aﬀect the SNR of the receiver.
Note that SNR is represented as the ratio of the origi-
nal signal power (given by Ps) to the sum of jamming sig-
nal power (given by Pc) and channel noise power Nc. At
the desired location, channels are synchronized, and orig-
inal signals get boosted and jamming signals cancel each
other, yielding an SNR that equals to 4Ph·Pt
. The transmit
power Pt as well as the jamming signal power Pj are usu-
ally chosen much higher than the channel noise power Nc to
result in a satisﬁable SNR at the receiver (Pt (cid:29) Nc
). So
Nc is negligible compared to the jamming power. Accord-
ingly, at the undesired location, the channel is not synchro-

Impact of SNR on service area size: Assume Pj = Pt,
from Lemma 2, we can see that SNR approximate to 1
when ρ = 0 and the value 1 is the minima of SNR. With
SN R = 1, the receiver cannot distinguish between the orig-
inal and jamming signals. Theoretically, ρ = 0 happens
when the receiver is half wavelength far from the desired
location. For example, modern wireless devices like WIFI,
Bluetooth devices usually uses 2.4GHz as their central fre-
quency to transmit signals. The corresponding wavelength
is 0.125m (i.e. (3 × 108)/(2.4 × 109) = 0.125m), and the
service area size is 6.125 × 6.125cm2, when real signal and
jamming signal have the same power.
In practice, a couple of wavelength may be required to
gain such uncorrelated channels. For example, if the uncor-
relation is caused by 4 wavelengths, the service size will be
0.5 × 0.5m2. SNR at the undesired location also shows that
SNR decreases as the jamming signal power Pj increases.
Thus, if we require a smaller service area size in this sce-
nario, we may properly increase the jamming signal power
to meet the requirements.
6.3 Security Discussion
An attacker against the proposed system can be either
active or passive. An active attacker tries to create, inter-
rupt, intercept, block or overwrite the transmit signals to
prevent the receiver from obtaining the legitimate service.
The active attacker may launch multiple attacks. For exam-
ple, It may impersonate as an authorized service provider
to gain the trust of a receiver; It may inject malicious in-
formation into the channel to mislead the receiver; It may
jam the receiver so that the receiver cannot obtain the ser-
vice. However, these active attackers are not unique to our
scheme. Existing approaches have been proposed to deal
with these attacks. For example, the receiver can establish
the cryptographic authentication protocol with the service
provider to deal with impersonation attacks and conﬁrm the
message integrity [15] [16], and spread spectrum techniques
like Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum(FHSS) and Di-
rect Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) can be designed to
defend against jamming attacks [17] [18].
A passive attacker is usually an eavesdropper, which at-
tempts to obtain the legitimate service from the service
provider. For a basic eavesdropper, as shown in Lemma 2,
when the eavesdropper’s channel is totally uncorrelated from
the receiver’s channel, it will not achieved a boosted SNR
to decode the received service data.
It seems that multi-
ple eavesdroppers with high-gain, directional antennas may
collaborate to add their received signals together to form
a boosted signal, with which they can decode the original
service data. Nevertheless, no matter how many eavesdrop-
pers exist, the signals received by these eavesdroppers still
suﬀer from the wireless channel fading like the multipath
fading, and always exhibit diﬀerent shapes as long as their
channels are not calibrated for homomorphism at the service
provider side. Both the channel distortion and the jamming
signal cause the sum of received signals equivalent to that
of multiple random signals. As such, a boosted SNR cannot
be obtained for correct decoding.
2987. MULTI-USER MODE
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA), and Frequency Division Multiple
Access (FDMA) are three typical methods adopted by mod-
ern wireless communication systems to support multi-user
access. For CDMA, users are assigned with special designed
codes that are orthogonal to each other, and an individual
user can extract its own data by correlating received signals
with the assigned codes. For TDMA and FDMA, users are
assigned with distinct, non-overlapping time slots/frequency
bands to send and receive wireless signals. By utilizing dif-
ferent codes, time slots, and frequencies, the interferences
among wireless users can be eliminated.
These traditional techniques can be integrated into the
pinpoint system to support multiple users. Speciﬁcally, for
CDMA, the transmitter can directly encode jamming entan-
gled signal using the CDMA codes to deliver information
to all users. Since users are located at diﬀerent locations,
the transmit signals may need to be sent at distinct times
to compensate the time diﬀerence, and thus asynchronous
CDMA scheme is required at the transmitter. For TDMA,
the transmitter can pinpoint the service to each user dur-
ing its time slot. Note that the propagation synchroniza-
tion may introduce overlapping time slots due to the vary-
ing time shifts experienced by diﬀerent users. Thus, proper
time guard should be inserted between time slots to elimi-
nate the overlaps and avoid the interference among multiple
users. For FDMA, the transmitter can pinpoint the service
to each user at the assigned frequency band. If the Orthog-
onal Frequency-division Multiplexing (OFDM) is enforced,
because the spectrum assigned to each user by OFDM is
normally limited, the receiver may have a weak multipath
eﬀect that causes less distortion to jamming entangled sig-
nals. Nevertheless, the amplitude attenuations are diﬀerent
for diﬀerent locations, without channel synchronization, the
jamming entangled signals still exhibit random amplitudes
when arrive at an undesired receiver, and consequently the
jamming portion cannot cancel each other, ensuring the ser-
vice exclusiveness.
8. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
We develop a prototype pinpoint service system on top of
the Universal Software Deﬁned Radio Peripherals (USRPs),
which are radio frequency (RF) transceivers with high band-
width and high dynamic range processing capability. The
USRPs use SBX broadband daughter boards operating in
the 400 - 4400 Mhz range as RF front ends. The software
toolkit implementing the prototype is the GNURadio [19].
8.1 System Design
The receiver is a standalone USRP, and the transmitter
(i.e., the service provider) consists of two USRPs connected
by an multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) cable.
Both USRPs follow the master and slave protocol. Specif-
ically, the master USRP connects to both the slave USRP
and the host computer, and the slave USRP only connects to
the master USRP. The master provides the clock scale and
the time reference to the slave USRP through the MIMO
cable. The master and slave USRPs are separated by about
0.75 meter to achieve uncorrelated channels between each
USRP and the receiver.
Our software program is developed from the Benchmark
TX/RX Program, which is the communication tool pro-
vided by GNURadio for data transmission and ﬁle trans-
fer between two USRPs. The source codes are located at
gnuradio/gr-digital/examples. For the transmitter, we re-
design the modulation block of the Benchmark TX program
by adding two new modules, namely jamming signal entan-
glement and channel calibration modules. We also add a
delay compensation module to compensate the diﬀerence of
signal arrival times measured at the master and slave US-
RPs. An input bit sequence is ﬁrst modulated into physical
layer symbols, then entangled with jamming signals, and ﬁ-
nally transmitted to the receiver after channel calibration
and delay compensation. Because the receiver requires no
speciﬁc changes, we directly run the Benchmark RX Pro-
gram at the receiver but add a constellation sink to observe
the real time constellation diagram for analyzing the perfor-
