may induce inconsistent priority settings and problematic handoffs
disclosed in our recent study [22]. Third, rich diversity does not
only exist in their distribution but also in their value range. Some
parameters disperse in a broad range of values (e.g., [-140dB, -8dB]
for ΘA5,S (both RSRP and RSRQ supported), and [40ms, 1280ms]
for the Tr epor tT riддer timer). Such wide dispersion implies that
those parameters probably affect handoff quality more as validated
in §4.
Diversity metrics. To quantify such diversity, we apply two popu-
lar metrics: Simpson index of diversity [19] and coefficient of varia-
tion [13]. Simpson index is to quantify the diversity in distribution.
It is better than the naive measure of the number of unique values
(richness) because it takes into account the relative abundance of
each value. Coefficient of variation is a well-defined, statistical mea-
sure to quantify the diversity in the value range. This complements
Simspon index for measuring relative variability. They are given by

eters across various carriers.
5.3 From One to Many Carriers
We extend the above study to all other carriers. Unsurprisingly,
rich diversity is observed in all other carriers. Due to space limit,
we mainly present interesting results on carrier-specific diversity.
We consider all four US carriers and other representative carriers
each from China (China Mobile), Korea (SK Telecom), Singapore
(MobileOne), Hong Kong (China Mobile Hong Kong) and Taiwan
(Taiwan Cellular). The conclusions are applicable to other carriers.
We select four representative parameters with different-level di-
versity observed in AT&T to exemplify their distributions in those
carrier networks in Fig. 15. We show diversity measures of the same
eight parameters across the chosen carriers in Fig. 17.
We clearly see that each parameter configuration is carrier spe-
cific. This gives several implications. First, parameters are likely
configured by carriers, not by telecom equipment vendors (default
values not in use). Second, we observe that diversity across multiple
parameters is consistent for certain carriers. For example, SK Telecom
(Korea) exhibits the lowest diversity for almost all the parameters.
All four representative parameters (priority, radio signal evaluation
thresholds/offsets) are single-valued; In contrast, all other carriers
except Mobileone (Singapore) use highly diverse configurations for
all the parameters. This implies that carriers adopt distinct (likely
proprietary) configurations and policies. There might be no single
answer given different goals of interests (performance, operational
cost, robustness, etc). But it might be a concern without thorough
investigation on whether the current one is a winner and how far
away, if not.
Implications: Carrier-specific configurations raise an interesting
question: which configuration (policy) runs best? There might be
no single answer given different goals of interests (performance,
operational cost, robustness, etc). It might be a concern if handoff
configurations are not well managed and verified before their use.
5.4 Understanding Handoff Configurations
We next delve into a closer look at why they are configured so. We
attempt to unveil what attributes contribute to current configura-
tion diversity and how. We consider three factors: cell frequency,
RAT, and location. We choose them because intuitively, operators
may customize their policies per cell for finest-grained manage-
ment (low temporal dynamics validated in §5.1). These three factors
decide the cell type (what the cell is) and location (where the cell
is), which are the most important cell properties visible to us.
Frequency. We first select PS and PC, the priorities of the
5.4.1
serving and candidate cells for frequency dependence analysis. In-
tuitively, they should be frequency-dependent. Fig. 18 plots their
breakdown per frequency channel in AT&T. All the carriers with
Figure 18: The breakdown of the serving (top) and candidate
(bottom) cell priorities over frequency (AT&T).
multiple values (except SK and MO with low diversity) observe sim-
ilar frequency-dependent patterns (omitted without enough space).
AT&T uses 24 distinct channels, and the operating frequency for the
serving cell primarily over the channels numbered as 850, 1975, 2000,
5110, 5780 and 9820, which matches with its 4G band usage [4]. The
channel number is called EARFCN (LTE Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number), and their mappings to frequency spectrum bands
are regulated by [11] and can be found online, e.g., via [3].
We see that each frequency channel is mostly associated with
one single/dominant value and the use of multiple frequency chan-
nels is the primary contributor to current priority diversity (ex-
ceptions explained later). There are several interesting findings.
First, AT&T uses a lower priority (here, 2) for LTE-exclusive bands
(called main bands [4], bands 12 and 17 around 700MHz), includ-
ing 5110/5145 (band 12) and 5780 (band 17); Channel 1975 (band 4,
AWS-1) is an exception. A higher priority (5 or 4) is mainly assigned
to the 9820 channel (band 30, 2300 MHz WCS), which was recently
acquired to provide additional bandwidth. Such priority setting im-
plies that AT&T prefers the additional bands to the LTE-exclusive
(main) bands and tends to use 3G-coexisting bands for LTE as much
as possible. This sounds like a good upgrade strategy which fa-
cilities and accelerates wide adoption of a new RAT. Second, some
frequencies use multiple values which are prone to conflicts. For ex-
ample, AT&T assigns two or three values over the channels of 1975,
2000, 2425, 5870 and 9820. This is observed at 6.3% of AT&T cells in
our measurement study. Such multiple-value priority settings are
also observed in other carriers. However, such inconsistent prior-
ity settings might make trouble. Consider a case where two cells
believe the other has a higher priority. It is prone to a handoff loop,
which was reported by our prior work [22]. Our large-scale study
shows that this problem exists in many carriers and unfortunately,
it is not as rare as we anticipated before. Third, our study helps trou-
bleshoot the problematic practice. We notice that updating priorities
with new channel preference can be problematic in practice. [1]
reports one recent user complaint that AT&T breaks the 4G service
for the phones that do not support band 30 (here, channel 9820). But
no technical cause has been reported. Now, we know why. AT&T
sets the highest priority to band 30 and thus the handoff decision
step likely chooses the cell over it, even when 4G LTE cells over
different channels are available (otherwise, the phone could not
work well before). Given that not all the phones support band 30
(e.g., a Verizon iPhone 6S+ [1]), they are unable to switch to the
target cell all along and thus the 4G service is disrupted. Actually,
conflicts or inconsistent configurations between base stations and
mobile devices are not rare. We had observed other instances in
our previous study [27].

ζM,θ |F = E(cid:2)|(M(θ|F = Fj) − M(θ)|(cid:3)
We further quantify such frequency dependence, using a generic
(5)
where M(θ) is the θ’s diversity measure (here, D or Cv). We com-
pare it with the expectation of the conditional ones {M(θ|F = Fj)}.
We plot ζD,θ |f r eq and ζCv ,θ |f r eq for all the parameters observed
in AT&T in Fig. 19. We indeed observe that frequency dependence
per parameter is also carrier-specific and do not show these results
due to space limit. However, it holds true to all the carriers that
not all highly diverse parameters (here, No.≥ 17) are frequency-
dependent. Interestingly, we find that some reporting events are
frequency-dependent like A2 (index: 32) and A5 (index: 33 and 34)
but some not, such as A1 (index: 21) and A3 (index: 21). This helps to
infer the carrier’s handoff policies. Here, we can see that there is a
universal standard for a good cell (A2) and relative comparison (A3)
but the standard for a poor cell (A2) and the absolute value setting
(A5) are frequency-dependent. We also observe that some other
parameters like Tr epor tT riддer (index 35) and hysteresis (index: 27)
are frequency-indepenent, which matches with their use.
5.4.2 Location. We quantify the impacts of location at the macro-
level (city) and micro-level (proximity). We aim to answer two
questions: (1) Do operators customize their configurations in cities?
(2) Will diversity disappear (or greatly decline) among nearby cells?
City-level. Here, we study US cities only. We divide our dataset
based on the cities where the configurations are collected and we
present the results for top-5 cities (total number of cells in four US
carriers): C1(Chicago: 4671), C2 (LA: 2982), C3 (Indianapolis: 2348),
C4 (Columbus: 1268), C5 (Lafayette: 745). We choose PS and normal-
ize its distribution in each city. Fig. 20 plots the results. We observe
that carriers may configure cells at different geographical locations
slightly differently. In C1 (Chicago), their configurations obviously
differ from those in other cities. This is understood. Operators usu-
ally divide their network domain (one nation) into multiple market
areas and they may run incremental deployment and configurations
over time. The bands used may differ as well. We also check other
parameters and observe location-dependent diversity.
Implications: Operators deploy different configuration values at
different locations(cities). This also explains some problematic con-
figurations are observed only at specific areas.
Proximity. We further consider those cells in close proximity.
Handoffs are distributed. After mobile device switches to a new
serving cell, the configurations associated with the new cell take
effects. So a handoff is affected by configurations at co-located cells.

Figure 21: Spatial diversity for Ps under various Radii in In-
dianapolis (C3).
As our data collection is dependent upon user movement, we ob-
serve that the cells covered in our dataset are sparse except those
cells collected by us. So we use a subset of dataset D2 which is
collected in a more controlled manner by us. In particular, we drive
along the main roads separated every 500m –1Km and cover the
whole city to get a more dense collection. We have done so in C3, C4
and C5, partially in C1 and C2. We apply Eq. (5) to define a measure
of spatial diversity as ζM,θ |R, where R is the radius of one neigh-
borhood, M is the diversity metric and θ is the parameter to study.
For any cell c, we obtain the cluster of cells located in a circle of
radius R km and obtain ζM,θ |R[c]. To illustrate its spatial diversity,
Fig. 21 shows the boxplot of ζM,θ |R[c] for all the cells in C3. We
select various radii to gauge the change in configurations. We only
show the results for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. We observe that
carriers indeed use varying values for cells located closely to each
other. This indicates that even in a very small geographical area
(r < 0.5), carriers prefer to fine tune different parameters. However,
this is not the case for all the carriers. In T-Mobile, we observe that
spatial diversity in close proximity is extremely small (almost zero).
That is, spatial diversity does exist across small geographical areas
but is also carrier dependent.
Implications: Lower dispersion is observed in a smaller range (like
a city or a neighborhood). Location-dependency is likely caused by
real-world deployment (the network deployment and upgrade do
not happen at the same time using the same equipments). It can
be also attributed to the carrier’s configuration over a geographic
area.
5.5 Evolution of RATs
We finally study the configuration patterns under other RATs and
learn how they have evolved. Because different RATs use different
sets of parameters, it is hard to compare each parameter across
RATs. We thus calculate the diversity metric (here, Simpson index)
for all the parameters and show their boxplots in Fig. 22. We see
that handoff configurations are becoming more and more diverse
along the RAT evolution. In particular, LTE heavily inherits from

and failures upon mobility. Improper configurations should share
the blame for some cases (e.g., see §5.4.1).

UMTS and thus they have a large number of parameters in com-
mon. CDMA2000 and CDMA1x are used by Sprint and Verizon
and configured differently from LTE. They use a smaller number of
handoff parameters. Most of the parameters are observed to have
a single dominant value and relatively static configurations. Simi-
larly, GSM is also observed to have an almost static configuration
scheme. The average diversity of their parameters is significantly
smaller than those of LTE and WCDMA, indicating single dominant
values. Thus, the evolution of RATs over time has also made the cell
handover procedure more convoluted and complicated where more
numerous parameters with varying and diverse configurations are
used.
Implications: Increasing diversity may continue in the coming 5G,
especially with hybrid and more radio access options. Our study likely
helps understand mobility support in 5G as well.
6 IMPLICATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
We now discuss the implications and potential actions for operators,
end users, and the research community. Our study further opens
problems that warrant future efforts.
Suggestions for operators. Operators should verify the correct-
ness and validate the expected properties of their configurations.
They should also reassess their used configuration algorithms for
active-state handoffs. Our study has confirmed that certain configu-
rations are problematic and yield nontrivial performance penalties.
We make four suggestions for operators to check their hand-
off configurations. First, they should look into A3 and A5 events
for active-state handoffs. Some negative offset values are observed
