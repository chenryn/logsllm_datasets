The issue appears to stem from a leak of `journalctl` processes, which originates in the following code: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/vendor/github.com/google/cadvisor/utils/oomparser/oomparser.go#L169. 

In #23491, the kubelet unit files were configured to restart only the kubelet process. This change has led to orphaning and leaking of `journalctl` processes launched by cAdvisor. It is also possible that this behavior could result in the leakage of other processes such as `du`, `ls`, and `mount`.

@kubernetes/sig-node, we need to address this issue. I recommend reverting the changes made in #23491, as suggested by @wwwtyro, as a starting point for resolving the problem.
