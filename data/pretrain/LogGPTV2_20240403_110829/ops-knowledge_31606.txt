User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题upstream sent more data than specified in "Content-Length" header while reading upstream I have django app (based on Mezzanine). 

My nginx conf looks like:

upstream myhost {
    server 127.0.0.1:8000;
}

server {

    listen 80;
    server_name www.myhost.ru myhost.ru;
    client_max_body_size 10M;
    keepalive_timeout    15;

    location / {
        proxy_redirect      off;
        proxy_set_header    Host                    $host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For         $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Protocol    $scheme;
        proxy_pass          http://myhost;
    }

    location /static/ {
        root            /home/myhost/virtualenvs/myhost/project;
        access_log      off;
        log_not_found   off;
    }

    location /robots.txt {
        root            /home/myhost/virtualenvs/myhost/project/static;
        access_log      off;
        log_not_found   off;
    }

    location /favicon.ico {
        root            /home/myhost/virtualenvs/myhost/project/static/img;
        access_log      off;
        log_not_found   off;
    }

}


In browser I see "Internal Server Error".

I see following errors in /var/log/nginx/errir.log:

2013/04/20 12:24:57 [warn] 11479#0: *1 upstream sent more data than specified in "Content-Length" header while reading upstream, client: 89.189.170.4, server: www.rureads.ru, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/", host: "myhost.ru"

What may cause the problem? How to fix this?

Assistant: Ok, so I struggled with this one for quite awhile. In my case, I had an import error relating to mezzanine lurking in my django application (which didn't show itself when using the django development server). For some reason (perhaps a gunicorn bug?), this import error wasn't being displayed in the browser (even with DEBUG=True) or logged by gunicorn. Instead, I was just getting an "Internal server error" from nginx and the "Upstream sent more data that specified..." message in the nginx error log. The gunicorn logs just logged the request as if everything went fine. Given that no specific error was being logged anywhere, it took me a long while to find the import error and fix it. In my case, I was able to get the django error page to show up only by commenting out all MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings and setting DEBUG=True. This revealed the import error, which I fixed. Then, I re-enabled the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES, restarted the gunicorn workers and everything worked fine! 

Hopefully this saves someone some time.
