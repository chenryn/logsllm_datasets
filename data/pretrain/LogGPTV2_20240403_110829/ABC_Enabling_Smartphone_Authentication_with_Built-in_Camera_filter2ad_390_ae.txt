Fingerprint Matching: this process involves two rounds of
noise extraction and PCE calculation. The time consumption
of this procedure is shown in Fig. 17(a).
Forgery Detection: since the required noise residues have
been obtained in the previous procedure, this procedure only
involves one round of PCE calculation. Fig. 17(b) shows the
time consumption of this process.
Removal Detection: this process involves two rounds of
noise extraction and PCE calculation. For the probe signal
used in our prototype (800×800), the protocol uses up to 0.9
seconds to detect ﬁngerprint removal.
Overall Protocol Efﬁciency: For each test, we utilize the
parallel pool of Matlab with four workers on a local machine.
Two of the workers conduct ﬁngerprint matching and forgery
detection sequentially, and the other two workers conduct
removal detection with the probe signals shown in Table
II. As shown in Fig.17(c), for most of the tested common
resolutions, ABC achieves high efﬁciency. Compared with
the ﬁngerprint matching process,
the security mechanisms
integrated in the protocol only introduce 7.5% additional run
time to the authentication process.
The latency for high resolution images is mainly caused by
the ﬁngerprint extraction process. We note here that the code
published by the digital data embedding laboratory [27] does
not take advantage of GPU computing and parallel computing.
With further optimization, the efﬁciency would be signiﬁcantly
improved. Moreover, as shown in Sections VI-B4 and VI-B5,
images with a low scaling rate can also achieve high ac-
curacy with reasonable registration overhead. Therefore, for
smartphone models with high resolution cameras, the veriﬁer
can reduce the overhead of the authentication process through
cropping the received image to low resolution.
D. Usability Study
To understand the users’ behaviors, needs, and attitudes
towards the ABC protocol, we conducted a user study with
a prototype using two Samsung Galaxy Note 5 devices as
the smartphone to be authenticated and the veriﬁer. In the
prototype, we use a NFC channel to implement the wireless
channel from the smartphone to the veriﬁer. We tested our
system on 40 participants (20 males and 20 females) aged from
21 to 54. They were randomly picked from the general public.
During the test, we ﬁrst gave a one-minute introduction to
the system. Each participant was then required to conduct the
smartphone authentication using our prototype without further
guidance. Since people are familiar with photographing with
smartphones, all participants were able to easily accomplish
the task on their ﬁrst attempt. Fig. 17(d) shows the CDF
of the time taken by each participant in photographing the
challenging QR code. 95% of the participants thought that the
photographing phase is efﬁcient and comfortable. In particular,
5 female participants pointed out that photographing is better
than typing password since remembering passwords places a
considerable burden on them. For the NFC transmission phase,
80% of the male participants criticized that the transmission
speed of the NFC channel
is a little slow while 90% of
the female participants thought that the transmission speed is
acceptable and the way it transfers data is interesting.
VII. RELATED WORK
Hardware ﬁngerprinting has been actively studied in recent
years. Due to manufacturing imperfection, physical sensors
introduce systematic distortions on their output. It has been
shown that the distortions generated by motion sensors, acous-
tic sensors, and wireless transmitters are strong enough to
ﬁngerprint off-the-shelf smartphones.
Dey et al. [20] exploit the imperfection of the accelerom-
eter. They stimulate the sensor with a vibration motor and
use machine learning to create the ﬁngerprint. Bojinov et
al. [5] analyze the calibration error of the accelerometer and
verify its effectiveness with a large number of devices. This
method requires the user to perform a calibration of the
accelerometer. Das et al. [18] further investigate combining
13
the features of both accelerometers and gyroscopes to generate
more accurate ﬁngerprints. However, their method requires the
user to precisely rotate the smartphone with several angles.
Moreover, the ﬁngerprints of motion sensors are manipulatable
and can be easily eliminated [18], [17].

Acoustic ﬁngerprints can also be used to uniquely identify
smartphones. Das et al. [16], [15] extract auditory ﬁngerprints
from a process of playing and recording audio clips. Zhou et
al. [41] explore the speaker’s frequency response to a specially
designed audio input. Chen et al. [9] combine the frequency
response of one device’s speaker and another device’s micro-
phone as the hardware ﬁngerprint for device authentication.
However, these methods require access to the microphone and
lead to privacy concerns [17].
Radio frequency ﬁngerprinting is also an active research
area. Several individual steps in the process of generating
wireless signals, all due to hardware imperfections of a trans-
mitter [14], can be the source of the RF ﬁngerprints. Different
ﬁngerprint sources include the clock jitter [39], device antenna
[12], DAC sampling error [32], power ampliﬁer non-linearity
[32], [33], [30], modulator sub-circuit [6], and the mixer or
local frequency synthesizer [38].
Although hardware ﬁngerprinting has been proved to be
effective in tracking smartphones, it is unclear whether these
methods can resist an impersonation attack. Since the signal
generated by a sensor is manipulatable, most ﬁngerprinting
methods are vulnerable against forgery attacks where an ad-
versary tampers with the sensor data intentionally [8], [13].
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we explore the idea of utilizing the im-
age sensor’s PRNU as a smartphone’s unique ﬁngerprint to
implement the physical layer device authentication. We ﬁnd
that smartphone cameras demonstrate very strong PRNU.
Based on this fact, we design ABC, an attack-resilient, real-
time, and user-friendly smartphone authentication protocol that
differentiates smartphones through the PRNU of their built-in
cameras. The registration of a smartphone’s PRNU requires
only one image. We implement a prototype of ABC and test
it with 16,000 images collected from Amazon Mechanical
Turk and our own devices. The experimental results show that
ABC can efﬁciently authenticate users’ devices with an error
rate less than 0.5% and detect ﬁngerprint forgery attacks with
an error rate less than 0.47%. Our user study suggests that
the PRNU-based authentication is a promising approach for
enhancing smartphone security.
With more and more smartphone manufacturers adopting a
dual-camera (rare) system, we plan to investigate how to take
advantage of the extra camera and improve the security of ABC
as future work. With a dual-camera system, the veriﬁer will
be able to identify each smartphone with ﬁngerprints of the
two cameras and further increase the difﬁculty of ﬁngerprint
forgery. We will also consider the characteristics of different
dual-camera system types: IPhone 7 plus is equipped with a
wide-angle camera and a telephoto camera to achieve higher-
quality zoom from farther away; Huawei P9 combines two
image sensors, one RGB and one monochrome, to enhance
the detail of the captured image.
