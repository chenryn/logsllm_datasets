Abstract. The end-to-end (e2e) stability of Internet routing has been
studied for over a decade, focusing on routes and delays. This paper
presents a novel technique for uncovering the origins of delay variations
by measuring the overlap between delay distribution of probed routes,
and how these are aﬀected by route stability.
Evaluation is performed using two large scale experiments from 2006
and 2009, each measuring between more than 100 broadly distributed
vantage points. Our main ﬁnding is that in both years, about 70% of
the measured source-destination pairs and roughly 95% of the academic
pairs, have delay variations mostly within the routes, while only 15-
20% of the pairs and less than 5% of the academic pairs witness a clear
diﬀerence between the delays of diﬀerent routes.
1 Introduction
The Internet has evolved in recent years to become a complex network, with
increasing usage of load-balancing and traﬃc shaping devices. These devices
change the way packets ﬂow, therefore aﬀecting the observed stability of routes
and delays between hosts. This, in turn, aﬀects various delay and jitter sensitive
applications, such as VoIP and IPTV. On the other hand, load on devices is
not constant and may change the delay packets observe along the same route
signiﬁcantly. Therefore, it is important to understand both the delay stability
along the path and to identify the source of the delay variability when such
variability exists.
Wang et al. [1] and more recently Pucha et al. [2] studied the impact that
speciﬁc routing events have on the overall delay. They showed that although
routing changes can result in signiﬁcant round trip delay increase, their vari-
ability is small for most of the measured path transitions, therefore allowing
applications to make use of such stability.
Augustin et al. [3] examined the delay between diﬀerent parallel routes at a
short time epoch. They compared the minimum delay of each route, and found
that only 12% have a delay diﬀerence which is larger than 1ms. Using similar
techniques, Pathak et al. [4] studied the delay asymmetry and found that there
is a strong correlation between changes in the one-way delay and corresponding
route changes.

Unlike previous work, we study the RTT delay along longer time periods,
hours and days, and examine how diﬀerent is the delay distribution between
parallel routes. For this purpose we use delay samples to deﬁne an interval in
which the delay of each route resides, and look at the overlapping between in-
tervals of parallel routes. If the two intervals are disjoint we know that the e2e
delay value mostly depends on the route in use and not on the variance in the
route. As the overlap between the intervals increases, the delay variance is mostly
attributed to changes along the route itself, e.g., due to change in load.
Evaluation is performed by conducting two large-scale experiments in 2006
and in 2009. Using DIMES [5], a highly distributed community-based measure-
ments infrastructure, we planned these two 96-hours experiments each utilized
more than 100 actively measuring vantage points (VPs), located in a broad set
of ASes and geographical locations, contributing more than 200k e2e routes.
Our main ﬁnding is that in about 70% of the measured source-destination
pairs, in both experiments, the delay variations are mainly explained by changes
within the routes, while only 15-20% of the pairs witness a clear diﬀerence be-
tween the delays of diﬀerent routes. The remaining 10-15% of the pairs witness
a mixture of the above, with a higher tendency for intra-route changes as con-
tributors to the delay variance. Pairs that have their source and destination in
academic ASes exhibit much higher route stability, which further increases the
percentage of delay variations within the routes to 95%.
2 Quantifying Route and Delay Stability
2.1 Deﬁnitions
The input data is a collection of traceroute measurements for a set P of ordered
source destination pairs, Pi = {Si, Di}. For each pair, Pi, the set of e2e IP-
level traceroutes, T Ri, is partitioned into ki equivalence subsets (i.e., any two
traceroutes in each subset are the same), denoted by Ei. The size of the sub-
j| is the total number of traceroutes it contains. Each equivalence subset
set |Ei
j, 1 ≤ j ≤ ki has a single representing route R(Ei
Ei
j) which is the measured path
between the source and the destination.
For each pair Pi we deﬁne the dominant route as the route R(Ei
j) whose subset
size, |Ei
j|, is the largest. It is possible that several equivalence subsets have the
same size, therefore they are all considered dominant routes. For brevity, we
assume for now that each pair has a single dominant route, with index r.
2.2 Measurement Setup
The data used in this paper is obtained from DIMES [5], a community-based In-
ternet measurements system. DIMES performs active measurements using hun-
dreds of software agents installed on users’ PCs. Agents perform roughly two
measurements per minute (either traceroutes or ping using either ICMP or UDP)
by following a script that is sent to them from a central server.

DIMES provides researchers with the ability to run “experiments” by deﬁn-
ing the set of agents, probing protocols and a set of destinations. Since some
agents are installed on end-users machines, the number of measurements may
vary depending on their availability. Usually, more than 80% of the planned
measurements are performed.
For the purpose of this paper we performed two similar experiments that took
place in December 2006 and September 2009. In each experiment, we selected
over 100 globally distributed agents and designed 96-hours experiments in which
each agent executed UDP and ICMP traceroute measurements to all other agents
in a round robin fashion. For each traceroute measurement we take the minimum
delay of at most four probes sent over a period of a few seconds (in case of a
lost probe we do not send another one instead). Since DIMES is a community
based platform not all of the agents are constantly active during the experiments
period. Moreover, since there is a certain churn in users along time, not the same
agents were selected in both experiments. Thus, 120 agents were selected, making
sure that there will be valid results from more than 100 agents. The scripts we
wrote had one UDP and one ICMP measurement to each of the 120 destination
IP addresses. Therefore, an agent probes each IP address twice every two hours.
Agents repeated the same script for four days. In total, each of these experiments
result in over one million traceroute measurements results.
Note that traceroutes probe the forward-path of routes, while the delays are
round-trip. Pathak et al. [4] analyzed the delay asymmetry and showed that one-
way delay can be diﬀerent than round-trip, meaning that it is possible that our
delay measurements actually capture instability that exists in both the forward
and reverse paths. Following Pucha et al. [2], we analyzed the stability of routes
as measured from opposite directions in our dataset, and found that over 90%
of the pairs have forward and reverse path RouteISM that are diﬀerent by less
than 0.3 (not shown due to lack of space). This indicates that the stability of
the forward path can serve as an indication to the reverse path. We attribute
this to the observation that even non-symmetric routes share similar hops that
can contribute instability to both directions. Thus, comparing the instability of
RTT delay with the routing instability of the forward route is meaningful.
2.3 Pair and Route Identiﬁcation
When comparing two routes we seek to answer if they are equal and if not,
quantify their diﬀerence. Several diﬃculties arise in both aims. Since DIMES
is a community-based project, most traceroutes start with several private IP
addresses before reaching the routable Internet. Moreover, some use laptops and
may travel during the time of the experiment. In order to decrease the chance
of over-estimating instability, only the routable section of each traceroute is
considered for the analysis. The identiﬁcation of a pair is done using the ﬁrst
and last hops of the routable traceroute. This help us mitigate instability that
might appear in the non-routable networks, which are presumed to have little
aﬀect on the overall delay instability. In the analysis, we only include pairs that
witness at least 20 traceroutes.

Two (routable parts of) traceroutes are considered equal when their ordered
list of IP addresses are exactly the same. To quantify the diﬀerence between
two traceroutes we calculate their Edit Distance [6] (ED) value by counting the
minimal number of insert, delete, and modify operations that are needed in order
to make the two routes equal. Obviously, ED is highly correlated with the length
of the compared routes. To be able to compare ED values that are calculated on
routes with various lengths, the ED is normalized by the length of the longest
route of the two input routes. This technique is similar to the one described by
He et al. [7] who used it for quantifying AS-level asymmetry. We extend here
the technique to consider stability instead of symmetry. Since the ED cannot
be greater than the longest route, the normalized ED value is between 0 and
1, where 0 means that the two routes are identical and 1 means that they are
completely diﬀerent.
2.4 Route Stability
We use two methods for quantifying the stability of a route. The overall appear-
ance ratio (i.e., prevalence [8]) of a route with index j, i.e., R(Ei
j), in pair Pi is
the portion of traceroutes in the set Ei
j. The prevalence of the dominant route
R(Ei
r) is used as the ﬁrst indication to the stability of routing for each pair,
since having a dominant route with high prevalence suggests that the remaining
paths are relatively rare.
The second estimation of pair Pi stability is calculated by ﬁnding the normal-
ized ED between the dominant route, R(Ei
r), to all other non-dominant routes,
j), j (cid:3)= r. For pairs that have more than a single dominant route, we use the
R(Ei
dominant route that is closest to each route in number of hops. We deﬁne the
Route Instability Measure (RouteISM) of a pair as the weighted average of all
normalized ED measures as depicted in Eq. (1). Thus, an ISM value close to 1
indicates high instability.

Two techniques were used in the past to measure distance between routes.
Pucha et al. [2,4] deﬁned the similarity coeﬃcient for calculating AS level route
symmetry as the number of similar elements divided by the total number of dis-
|Pi∩Pj|
|Pi∪Pj| . He et al. [7] used string matching which
tinct elements in the two routes
is similar to our ED. We follow the latter and argue that ED better captures
stability since it takes into account the order of elements in each route.
2.5 Delay Stability
We are interested in the expected e2e round trip delay of a route over time
and not in short term congestion. Recall that we take the minimum delay of at
most four probes sent over a period of a few seconds, and repeat each traceroute
roughly twice an hour (UDP and ICMP) over a period of four days.

Fig. 1. Examples of pairs with overlapping and non-overlapping conﬁdence intervals.
The segments show the conﬁdence intervals of a routes, calculated using the delay
samples which are shown as varying sized circles (larger radius means more samples).
For a given pair Pi, each equivalence set Ei
j, has several diﬀerent e2e RTT
delay samples (henceforward “delays”), denoted by RT T (Ei
j). We wish to quan-
tify the stability of pair delays and whether their variance is the result of delay
dynamics of each route or delay diﬀerence between diﬀerent routes. This analysis
can uncover whether delay instability is mainly the result of traﬃc anomalies
in a route (e.g., congested routers), or the result of route diversity due to load-
balancers.
For each route Ei
j, we have the group RT T (Ei
j) of delay measurements. To
ﬁnd the region of expected delay for the route, we treat the measured delays as
samples of some distribution and calculate the average and the 95% conﬁdence
interval [9] around it. This conﬁdence interval, denoted by CI(Ei
j), provides
us with a segment surrounding the measured mean of RT T (Ei
j). Within this
interval we expect to ﬁnd the route delay. Note that this is an unorthodox
use of conﬁdence interval, but we believe it gives us a good characterization
of the expected route delay (as is nicely shown in Fig. 1). Measurements with
high variance result in larger segments than measurements with small variance,
indicating that they are less stable.
For a source-destination pair, the normalized overlap between two segments
CI(Ei
j) and CI(Ei
k) is deﬁned by

The normalized overlap is equal to 0 when the two segments do not overlap,
meaning that their delays are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. This indicates that changes
in the route delay are mainly the result of having diﬀerent routes. When it is
equal to 1, the segments completely overlap or one contains the other, meaning
that diﬀerent routes exhibit similar delay distribution, indicating that instability
26

is not the result of multiple routes between the source and destination, but due to
changes within the routes. For example, Fig. 1(a) shows the routes from Deutsche
Telekom in Germany to Datagroup in the Ukraine. There are ﬁve diﬀerent routes
with more than 30 measurements (the y-axis label is the number of measurements
per route) but they are all overlapping, namely they have roughly the same
delay average. On the other hand, Fig. 1(b) shows the routes from ParaCom
Technologies in USA to Reach Networks in Australia. While in the previous
ﬁgure the delay changes are attributed to variance of delays inside the routes,
this ﬁgure clearly shows that the delay changes is the result of multiple routes
with four distinct mean delays.
When the number of measurements in the route is small, the statistical sig-
niﬁcance of the samples is small, and the conﬁdence interval can be very large
and not meaningful. Fig. 4(a) shows that for 80% of the routes the conﬁdence
interval is below 0.2 of the average delay. Since the number of routes with statis-
tical signiﬁcance change between pairs, we calculated the overlap only between
the two largest equivalence groups (routes) of each pair, providing each has at
least 30 delay measurements.
3 Dataset Analysis
3.1 Distribution of Vantage Points
Using a community based platform, results in a certain churn in the availability of
measuring agents. Therefore, during the planning of the experiments, we selected
measuring agents that hold all of the following criteria: (a) they were active in
the past week, (b) distributed in a large set of ASes, and (c) distributed in a
large set of geographical regions. The ﬁrst criterion is to maximize the chance
that the selected agent will indeed be active during the experiment period. The
other two criteria were selected to achieve e2e routes with diverse lengths that
traverse through various ASes spread across diﬀerent countries and continents,
as an attempt to capture an accurate image of the Internet [10].
In the 2006 experiment, 102 agents returned slightly over a million tracer-
outes, providing us with 6861 source-destination directed pairs. Most VPs are
distributed in the USA and Canada (70), followed by Western Europe (14), Aus-
tralia and New Zealand (10), Russia (6) and Israel (2). In the 2009 experiment,
105 agents returned 1.01 million traceroutes, resulting in almost 10950 source-
destination directed pairs. VPs are distributed in numerous countries in Western
Europe (41), followed by USA and Canada (38), Russia and the Ukraine (14),
Australia (4), South America (2), Israel (2), Japan (1), Taiwan(1), Singapore
(1) and the Maldives (1).
Using the list of AS types provided by Dimitropoulos et al. [11], we infer the
type of each VP. In 2006, 18% of the VPs are tier-1, 78% tier-2, 3% smaller
companies and 1% educational (a single agent). In 2009, DIMES agents were
installed in PlanetLab [12], which increased the number of educational VPs to
28% while reducing tier-1 VPs to 14% and tier-2 to 58%. Only 7 VPs appeared

in both experiments. This is due to the change in users that are running DIMES
agents over this time period.
In both experiments, a variety of ASes were traversed. Most of the tier-1 ASes
were traversed and the majority of the traversed ASes are tier-2.
3.2 Dataset Statistics
The cumulative distributions of the dominant route length and dominant route
median delay are shown in Fig. 2 (recall that there can be more than one dom-
inant route per source-destination pair). Fig. 2(a) shows that both experiments
have roughly the same path lengths, with 2009 being slightly shorter. The me-
dian of the dominant route length is 12 for 2006 and 11 for 2009; pairs with
academic source and destination ASes have even shorter routes, with median of
11 hops in 2009; the majority of the routes (97%) traverse less than 20 hops.
Our measured routes are shorter than reported by Paxson [8] in 1995. Paxson
reported mean route length between 15 and 16, using routable (and mostly aca-
demic) source and destination hosts. Since the Internet has been growing at high
rate since 1995, we attribute this reduction to the reacher connectivity among
ASes and increased adoption of layer-2 tunnels, which signiﬁcantly reduces the
number of IP-level hops.
Fig. 2(b) exhibits an almost identical median delay distribution of 2006 and
2009, with 2009 having slightly shorter delays, which correlates with the shorter
paths witnessed in Fig. 2(a). Over 80% of the routes in both years have a delay
of less than 200msec. However, there are almost 3% of the routes that have a
delay of over 1 second. Pairs that have end-points in the USA are have shorter
delays, with 80% of them having a delay less than 150msec. However, pairs with
academic end-points have signiﬁcantly shorter delays, with 90% of them having
a delay of less than 100msec.
