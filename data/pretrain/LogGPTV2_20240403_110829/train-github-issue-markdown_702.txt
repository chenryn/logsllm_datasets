I haven't tried it yet, but does webpack reduce dependencies according to the
package version? So if a module with the same version number is included from
two different directories, e.g. `A/node_modules/underscore@1.x` and
`B/node_modules/underscore@1.x`, webpack should include it only once into the
bundle.
It would be even better if webpack includes only one version as long as the
major version of those two dependencies don't differ. So if `myLib1` depends
on `underscore@1.1.3` and `myLib2` depends on `underscore@1.0.2`, webpack
should include only `underscore@1.1.3` because - according to semver \- it
won't break `myLib2`. Maybe this should be opt-in as it is potential risky.
In any case webpack should log a warning if two versions of the same module
are included.
