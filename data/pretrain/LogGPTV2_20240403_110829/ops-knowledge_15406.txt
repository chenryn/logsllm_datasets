User: Does poster.encode module supported in python appengine ??
if No , whats is the possible alternatives ?
Assistant: You'd need to deploy the module with your code by including it in your application's directory when deploying, but it does appear to be a pure python module and looking through the source I see no reason why it wouldn't work just fine in App Engine.
The only modules that won't work are those that use C extensions or make use of features like threads, sockets, etc. that are disabled in the App Engine runtime.  poster.streaminghttp, for example, almost certainly won't work, as it uses sockets.
