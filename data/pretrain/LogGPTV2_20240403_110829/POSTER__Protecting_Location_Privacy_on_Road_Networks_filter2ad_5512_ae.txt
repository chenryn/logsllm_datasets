with the increase in the number of decoys. This is because
the requests sent by decoys in the background take a bit of
bandwidth. Since the decoys do not need to download the
images and videos when sending requests, the impact on the
response time is still negligible. Overall, the wait time is
similar to the wait time for connecting a phone call, and hence
we expect it to be acceptable for users who care about their
location privacy. The minor ﬂuctuation among the response
time is mainly caused by the continuous generation of decoys’
locations.

We also compare the time performance of MoveWithMe
app running in four different brands of smartphones: Samsung
Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy S6, Google Nexus 5X, and
iPhone 7. Figure 12 shows the average response time for each
service when there is 0 decoy (k = 0) and 5 decoys (k = 5),
respectively. We can see that the MoveWithMe app incurs very
little delay for all the services tested. Note that the difference
in the response time among different services is mainly caused
by the network condition and the service providers’ servers.
C. Network Data Usage Testing
The third round of experiments aims to evaluate network
data usage. We tested two scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario,
we simulate the user’s daily activities. For each round in the
ﬁrst scenario, we search nearby bars, banks and gas stations
in Yelp, restaurants and ’things to do’ in TripAdvisor, hotels
in Hotels.com, museums in Google Arts & Culture, stores in
McDonald’s, and then search movies and theaters in MovieT-
ickets. In the second scenario, we refresh the lists of coffee and
tea in Yelp, restaurants in TripAdvisor, stores in McDonald’s,
and theaters in MovieTickets 10 times respectively, and record
the data usage.
As presented in Figure 13, since the decoys need to forge
multiple requests related to their locations while the user is
browsing the location-based service websites at the same time,
it is not surprising to see that the data usage increases with
the increase of k (the number of decoys). However, the extra
network data usage is very little, which is only 10% more
in the ﬁrst scenario and 18% more in the second scenario
while k equals to 5. This is because the decoys do not need

to download the images and other large ﬁles when sending
requests. The service requests from decoys are mainly text
contents which do not consume much bandwidth.
D. Battery Consumption Testing
In the end, we study how the MoveWithMe app affects the
battery consumption of smartphones. We tested two different
scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, we compare the total battery
consumption with and without running our MoveWithMe
app for a duration of 60 minutes. Note that even running
in the background, our MoveWithMe app is still generating
several decoys’ locations continuously to prepare for the use
at any time. As presented in Figure 14, our MoveWithMe
app consumes only 0.5% more battery at
the end of the
60 minutes of testing (k = 5). The experimental results
indicate that MoveWithMe’s decoy simulation algorithm is
very efﬁcient. Recall that the decoys’ proﬁles only need to
be generated once and then the follow-up generation of fake
locations is fast.
In the second scenario, we compare the battery consumption
with (k>0) and without (k = 0) the MoveWithMe app’s pro-
tection. Speciﬁcally, in a time period of 60 minutes, we sim-
ulate 10 rounds of user access to each service, i.e., browsing
all
the nine service websites every 6 minutes. Figure 15
reports the battery consumption results. As expected, with the
MoveWithMe app running, the smartphone consumes energy
slightly faster than just browsing location-based websites with-
out MoveWithMe. However, the additional battery needed for
the MoveWithMe app (k = 5) is less than 4%, which is almost
negligible and hard to be noticed by the user. The same pattern
is demonstrated for other smartphones as shown in Figure 16.
VI. DISCUSSION
Although the analysis and experimental results demon-
strate the practicability, effectiveness and efﬁciency of the
MoveWithMe system, there are still several limitations of the
proposed system as discussed below.
One limitation of the MoveWithMe system is that it relies on
the VPN (or TOR) services to hide the user’s real IP addresses
from the service providers and adversaries. If the user turns
off the VPN service when using the location-based services,
a short-term exposure may not cause privacy leakage because
the adversary will not know if this exposed IP address is the
user’s real IP address or just another one provided by the VPN.
If the disconnection to the VPN frequently occur at the same
time when the user accesses the location-based services, it is
likely that the adversary will be able to distinguish the user’s
real IP address from previous received VPN’s addresses.
The current version of MoveWithMe system can only
protect user’s location privacy while he/she is accessing
location-based service websites. Theoretically,
the Move-
WithMe can act as a middleware to provide location privacy
protection for mobile application as well. However, to intercept
the requests sent out by APPs, we have to gain the “root”
access of the mobile devices, which is not an easy job for
normal users and may introduce additional security risks.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a novel location privacy-preserving
mobile app–MoveWithMe–to help smartphone users protect
their location privacy when they need to frequently expose
their locations to location-based services. MoveWithMe can
be easily installed as other common apps without rooting
the device. The MoveWithMe system performs a sophisti-
cated decoy simulation algorithm and automatically generates
decoys at the runtime and sends service requests along with
the user’s real request to the service providers. Our proposed
algorithm ensures that these decoys act consistently like real
human beings as time passes, making it very hard for the
service provider to identify the real user from the group of
decoys and proﬁle the real user even by using advanced data

mining technologies. By evaluating the prototypes of the pro-
posed MoveWithMe system against a variety of location-based
services on various smartphones, we found that the Move-
WithMe system is very effective and introduces very little
overhead on the response time, network data usage, and battery
consumption. It is believed that by using our system, users will
be able to gain greater privacy when accessing location-based
services while still enjoying their full utilities.
