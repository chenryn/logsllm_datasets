### Impact of Decoy Increase on Response Time

As the number of decoys increases, the requests sent by these decoys in the background consume a small amount of bandwidth. However, since decoys do not need to download images and videos, the impact on response time remains negligible. The wait time is similar to that of connecting a phone call, which is generally acceptable for users concerned about their location privacy. Minor fluctuations in response time are primarily due to the continuous generation of decoy locations.

**Figure 12: Response Time on Different Smartphones**

We also compared the performance of the MoveWithMe app across four different smartphone brands: Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy S6, Google Nexus 5X, and iPhone 7. Figure 12 illustrates the average response time for each service when there are 0 decoys (k = 0) and 5 decoys (k = 5). The results show that the MoveWithMe app introduces very little delay for all tested services. The differences in response times among various services are mainly attributed to network conditions and the service providers' servers.

### Network Data Usage Testing

The third round of experiments aimed to evaluate network data usage. We tested two scenarios:

1. **Daily Activities Simulation**: In this scenario, we simulated a user's daily activities, including searching for nearby bars, banks, and gas stations on Yelp, restaurants and 'things to do' on TripAdvisor, hotels on Hotels.com, museums on Google Arts & Culture, stores on McDonald’s, and movies and theaters on MovieTickets.
2. **List Refreshing**: In the second scenario, we refreshed the lists of coffee and tea on Yelp, restaurants on TripAdvisor, stores on McDonald’s, and theaters on MovieTickets 10 times, respectively, and recorded the data usage.

As shown in Figure 13, the data usage increases with the number of decoys (k) because decoys need to send multiple location-related requests while the user is browsing location-based service websites. However, the additional network data usage is minimal, increasing by only 10% in the first scenario and 18% in the second scenario when k equals 5. This is because decoys do not need to download images and other large files, and their service requests are mainly text content, which consumes little bandwidth.

### Battery Consumption Testing

Finally, we examined the battery consumption of smartphones running the MoveWithMe app. We tested two scenarios:

1. **Background Operation**: We compared the total battery consumption with and without the MoveWithMe app running in the background for 60 minutes. Even in the background, the app continuously generates decoy locations. As shown in Figure 14, the MoveWithMe app consumes only 0.5% more battery at the end of the 60-minute test (k = 5), indicating that the decoy simulation algorithm is highly efficient.
2. **Foreground Browsing**: In the second scenario, we compared battery consumption with and without the MoveWithMe app's protection. Specifically, over a 60-minute period, we simulated 10 rounds of user access to each service, i.e., browsing all nine service websites every 6 minutes. Figure 15 shows the battery consumption results. As expected, the MoveWithMe app causes a slight increase in energy consumption, but the additional battery usage (k = 5) is less than 4%, which is negligible and barely noticeable to the user. Similar patterns were observed for other smartphones, as shown in Figure 16.

### Discussion

Although the analysis and experimental results demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the MoveWithMe system, several limitations exist:

1. **Dependency on VPN/TOR Services**: The MoveWithMe system relies on VPN (or TOR) services to hide the user's real IP address from service providers and adversaries. If the user turns off the VPN service, frequent disconnections can potentially expose the user's real IP address.
2. **Limited Scope**: The current version of MoveWithMe only protects location privacy while accessing location-based service websites. Extending this protection to mobile applications would require root access to the device, which is not feasible for most users and may introduce security risks.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced MoveWithMe, a novel location privacy-preserving mobile app designed to help smartphone users protect their location privacy when using location-based services. The app can be easily installed without rooting the device. MoveWithMe uses a sophisticated decoy simulation algorithm to generate and send service requests along with the user's real request, making it difficult for service providers to identify the real user. Our evaluation against various location-based services on different smartphones showed that MoveWithMe is highly effective and introduces minimal overhead in terms of response time, network data usage, and battery consumption. By using our system, users can gain greater privacy while still enjoying the full utility of location-based services.
