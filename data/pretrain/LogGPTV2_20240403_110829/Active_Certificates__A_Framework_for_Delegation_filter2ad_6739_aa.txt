## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to delegation in computer systems by leveraging the mobile code capabilities of modern systems. We present **active certificates**: cryptographically signed mobile agents that implement delegation policies. These active certificates combine several desirable properties, including expressivity, transparency, and offline operation, which are not available in existing systems. These properties make active certificates powerful tools for expressing delegation and can also be used to implement complex policy systems, such as public key infrastructures. Systems built using active certificates are easily extensible and interoperable. A prototype implementation of active certificates has been developed as part of the Ninja [17] project.

## 1. Introduction
Delegation is a fundamental tool for cooperation in computer systems. Components often need to delegate rights to other components to facilitate collaboration. However, delegation carries the risk of misuse, making it crucial to delegate only the precise set of rights necessary for the task at hand. This security concern is particularly relevant in today's distributed and untrusting environments [26, 27].

### Existing Approaches to Delegation
Several public key infrastructures address delegation through **delegation certificates**. A principal wishing to delegate rights issues a signed certificate that describes the delegated rights. The access monitor interprets the certificate, combining it with internal policies and other available certificates to produce an authorization decision. Designing such systems requires a policy language that is both simple enough for uniform interpretation and rich enough to specify restrictive policies. This often leads to delays in standardization and deployment, with differing implementations leading to incompatibilities [19].

Another mechanism for delegation is the use of **proxies**. A proxy is a daemon with sufficient credentials to act on behalf of the original rights owner. Proxies mediate requests and responses, enforcing a wide range of policies. While highly flexible, proxies require their own mechanisms for authentication and availability, introducing security concerns.

### Active Certificates: A New Approach
**Active certificates** combine the benefits of both delegation certificates and proxies. An active certificate is a special type of delegation certificate that contains the code for a mobile agent. This agent acts as a proxy, mediating requests and responses. When rights are requested, the access monitor instantiates the agent. The signed certificate ensures that requests from the agent are authenticated as coming from the signer, allowing the agent to proxy the original owner's rights.

Active certificates leverage mobile code to bring the generality of proxies to a certificate-based system, while avoiding the availability and security concerns of traditional proxies. They also inherit the offline operation and ease of distribution benefits of conventional certificates.

## 2. Active Certificates
### 2.1 Operation
We will illustrate the operation of active certificates using Alice, who has rights to access a resource and wishes to delegate some of these rights to Bob.

#### Without Delegation
When Alice accesses the resource directly, her requests and responses flow over an authenticated channel. The resource applies local policies to decide whether to authorize Alice's request.

#### With Delegation
To delegate rights to Bob, Alice creates a mobile agent, signs its code with her private key, and distributes the resulting active certificate to Bob. When Bob needs to access the resource, he presents the active certificate. The resource verifies the signature and instantiates the agent, which then mediates Bob's requests and responses. The agent enforces Alice's delegation policy, ensuring that Bob's actions are restricted as intended.

### 2.2 Properties
Active certificates combine the expressivity and transparency of proxies with the offline operation and ease of distribution of conventional certificates.

#### Expressivity
Expressivity is crucial in a delegation system to avoid weakening access control more than necessary. Proxies are highly general, but active certificates also offer significant expressivity by being interposed on the request/response path. The use of powerful languages (e.g., Java) allows for a wide range of policies.

#### Transparency
Active certificates retain much of the transparency of proxy-based delegation. The resource's runtime system can process active certificates without requiring extensive changes to the application, allowing delegation to proceed without explicit support from the application.

#### Offline Delegation
Active certificates enable offline delegation, giving Alice flexibility. She can create and distribute certificates without remaining online or leaving her private key on a network-connected computer. Each certificate can have an expiration date, and revocation schemes can be used for more immediate revocation.

## 3. Composition and Abstraction
Active certificates can be composed to enable further re-delegation and to decompose complex policies into smaller, manageable modules. The use of a general-purpose language allows for the definition of abstractions, making it possible to build complex policy systems based on active certificates.

## 4. Security Analysis
A formal examination of the security properties of active certificates will be presented in Section 4.

## 5. Implementation
Section 5 will describe our implementation of active certificates, including details of the prototype developed as part of the Ninja [17] project.

## 6. Related Work
Section 6 will discuss related work in the field of delegation and mobile code.

## 7. Future Work
Section 7 will outline future directions for research and development in active certificates.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, active certificates offer a new and powerful approach to delegation, combining the best features of both proxy-based and certificate-based systems. They provide a flexible, secure, and extensible framework for implementing complex delegation policies in modern computer systems.
