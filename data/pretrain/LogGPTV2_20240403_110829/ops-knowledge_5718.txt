User: Please give a common performance testing scheme in enterprise applications.
Assistant: 1. Identify test objectives: Identify test objectives and use them as an initial performance baseline. Measure performance indicators such as response time, throughput, and number of concurrent users of the application under different loads; 2. Test environment construction: establish a core test environment, including hardware and software configuration. Configurations similar to the real environment can be used, such as the number of servers, memory size, storage device performance, operating system version, and software pressure testing tools, etc.; 3. Load simulation design: design a real load simulation based on the analysis and forecast analysis of the actual environment . Including the number of users, request volume, data volume, etc. 4. Protocol layer and performance layer test: Before the performance test, the protocol layer test is required to confirm the protocol load and response. In addition, performance testing is required for the application, which involves parameters such as hardware configuration, software configuration, application function and response speed; 5. Test script design: write scripts for automated performance testing. The test needs to involve various scenarios, loads, etc.; 6. Execute the test: perform a performance test in a real environment. Note that in order to obtain the best results, the test time period and test cycle should also be targeted; 7. Test result analysis: After the performance test is completed, perform data processing, analyze the results expressed by the data, confirm whether the test target is achieved, and Modify or improve the results; 8. Summary and report: Write a summary report to review and evaluate the test to detect weaknesses in the current application and provide corresponding solutions.
