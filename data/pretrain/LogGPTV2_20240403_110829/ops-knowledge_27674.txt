Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of creating an instance on a hypervisor. It begins with the creation of an event for the instance, followed by the instance being resumed and spawned successfully. The image associated with the instance is then checked and found to be in use. The compute resources of the node are then audited and the compute service record is updated. Finally, the image associated with the instance is checked again and found to be in use.
