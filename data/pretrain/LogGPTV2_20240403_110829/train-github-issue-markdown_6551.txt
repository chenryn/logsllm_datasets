Please add the feature to select a column of text with the mouse (like Alt +
LMB (Left mouse button), or Shit + RMB) like Sublime Text...
There is a package that provides this functionality (Sublime-Style-Column-
Selection), but I think it's better that this feature should be provided by
atom itselft
