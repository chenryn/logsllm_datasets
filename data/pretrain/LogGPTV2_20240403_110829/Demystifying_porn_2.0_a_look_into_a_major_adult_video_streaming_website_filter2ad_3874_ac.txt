We ﬁnd that video popularity in YouPorn follows a far less skewed
distribution than traditionally understood. The reason lies in the
way users discover content, relying heavily on front page browsing.
Due to the non-interest-speciﬁc nature of this default browsing, we
conclude that most users have quite loose interest constraints, al-
lowing them to be satisﬁed by a potentially large portion of the
corpus. This results in a rapid decline in the number of page views;
most videos die out quickly as they get pushed down the brows-
ing order by newer published items. Consequently, we deduce that
the level of skew observed is actually largely an artifact of the way
content is presented to users, rather than any inherent aspect of the
video content itself.
6. CATEGORY ANALYSIS
The previous sections have looked at the corpus as a single col-
lection. However, videos within the corpus can also be listed under
one or more category pages. Although these categories do not offer
deﬁnitive information on the semantic nature of the videos, they al-
low us to inspect more targeted groups of content and their role in
helping users to discover content of interest.
6.1 Category primer
In total, 62 categories5 are available on YouPorn, spanning a
range of interests. For each video, an initial category is chosen at
upload time. Videos can also later be categorised further by other
users once the content is published. Whilst this community-driven
nature of categories means that some videos could be incorrectly
Only the most popular videos (> 100k views) can resist this de-
cay, with similar viewing ﬁgures being recorded on the ﬁrst and
second day.4 After the third day of their publication, however, even
extremely popular videos are likely to be pushed down by ≈10
pages, making it signiﬁcantly harder for users to discover them.
Thus, on the third day, they immediately begin to exhibit the traits
of their less popular counterparts, as their viewing ﬁgures plum-
met. Future views are then limited to users who are prepared to
more proactively seek content of interest. Relating this to tradi-
tional UGC, Crane and Sornette [18] provide a classiﬁcation of
video types (memoryless, viral, junk and quality). This would place

We also inspect the collective popularity of these various cate-
gories. Figure 11 presents the accumulated views for each cate-
gory. We observe a trend similar to Figure 10, with well populated
categories receiving many views. The most notable exception is
“NU” (videos without a category), which does extremely poorly in
relation to its size in the corpus. Whereas 17% of the corpus has
no category, these videos only collect 2% of the views. Table 2
provides an overview of the top 20 categories, ranked by size.
6.2 Efﬁciency of categories
We have seen that categories play an extremely important role in
discovering content in YouPorn, and that not participating in this

where V is the fraction of views that the category receives, and
C is the fraction of the corpus that the category constitutes. As a
video can have multiple categories tagged to it, we utilise two ways
of calculating these fractions. The ﬁrst approach,7 termed inefﬁ-
ciency, attributes one view to each category that the video is part
of; consequently, a video with two categories, “BL” and “AM”, will
have one view allocated to each. Obviously, this ﬁrst approach will
also artiﬁcially inﬂate the corpus size. The second approach, which
we term weighted inefﬁciency, splits the views of a video equally
between all categories it belongs to. Speciﬁcally, the number of the

down by 1
For both weighted and unweighted inefﬁciency, if the value of
I is above 0, it means that a category receives a disproportion-
ately large share of the views, whilst a value below 0 indicates that
a category receives disproportionately fewer views than would be

throughout the rest of this section.

However, it is by far the most
colocated category. On average, videos categorised as “GO" are
also placed in 10.36 other categories. We ﬁnd that 4 out of the top
10 categories, ranked by the colocation level, are also in the top
10 ranked by normalised popularity. This conﬁrms our suspicion
(backed by the small-scale user study; see Section 7) that category-
based browsing is an intensively used tool.

of videos in the category).
Figure 14: Number of views correlated with number of cate-
gories allocated to video.
To further validate the impact of colocation, Figure 14 presents
the average number of views against the number of categories a
video belongs to. We observe an almost linear trend in which
videos belonging to multiple categories get more views. On aver-
age, videos without any category receive just 51k views, compared
to 452k for those with 5 categories. We conclude that category
tags appear to be a signiﬁcant factor that contributes to views. It is
quite possible that uploaders, particularly commercial ones, might
exploit this observation. In fact, not being aware of the importance
of categories can have dire consequences for video popularity. We
observe that uncategorised videos appear in the bottom 20 most
unpopular categories ranked by absolute viewing ﬁgures (and the
least popular measured by normalised popularity).
6.4 Summary
We conclude that users in YouPorn rely heavily on category in-
formation for discovering content of interest. This appears to be
primarily driven by category-based browsing; this observation is
best highlighted by the almost linear relationship between the num-
ber of views a video receives and the number of categories it is

number of videos). For null, I = −8.96 and weighted I =

expected. More generally, a value above 0 represents a category in
which “demand outweighs supply” (popular), and a value below 0
represents a category in which “supply outstrips demand” (unpop-
ular). This provides a normalised view of popularity, in contrast to
the absolute one given in Figure 11.
Figure 12 presents the inefﬁciency levels for all categories, with
both measures of inefﬁciency showing very similar trends. First,
we observe that using the absolute number of views a category
receives is somewhat misleading. The category with the highest
viewing ﬁgures (“AM”) actually receives fewer views than could
be expected from its size in the corpus (I = −0.11).
It seems
that this category collects views through its dominance in the cor-
pus, rather than through an excessive demand for the genre. This
lack of efﬁciency is observable in all other categories too — sev-
eral unexpected genres have a disproportionately large number of
views, whereas other genres have too many videos and too few
views. 27 categories have a disproportionately large number of
videos in comparison to the views received (I  0).8 No categories were found to be truly market
