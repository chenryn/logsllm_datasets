  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Export a variable in your default shell (`~/.zlogin` for zsh; `~/.bash_login` for bash, for example. You can use `.bashrc` as well).
        export FOOBAR="1"
  2. Pass different value of the same variable to VSCode.
        FOOBAR=2 code .
  3. VSCode uses value defined for login shell, not current session:
Help > Toggle Developer Tools. And in Console, `process.env.FOOBAR` gives "1"
when I expect "2".
It looks like VSCode executes default shell as login shell again before
launching the program UI.
Being able to pass different values for existing environment variables greatly
helps writing/testing extensions.

    $ strace -E GOPATH=1 -E FOOBAR=2 -s 1000000 -e verbose=execve -e abbrev=none ./.build/electron/electron  .
    execve("./.build/electron/electron", ["./.build/electron/electron", "."], [... "GOPATH=1", ...]) # What I expected
    ...
    read(62, "...\nGOPATH=/home/saml/go\n....")  # What is this?
