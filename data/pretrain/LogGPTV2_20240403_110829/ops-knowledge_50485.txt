User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to install Windows Updates from command-line Is it possible to install windows updates from the command-line? The graphical update tool doesn't seem to work so well in Windows 7. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't... My problem is that I can't see any updates when I click to see the details list. So when there are updates that are not checked off by default, I can't install them...

So, is there an other way I can get those installed?

Assistant: Not sure about Windows 7, but with XP/Vista, you could run the following command to detect and download updates:

wuauclt /detectnow /reportnow


If you have issues getting it to work, check out the WSUS Wiki. 

Otherwise if you have a specific update that you want, just download from the Microsoft website. If there's some problem preventing you from installing, that's the best way to find out, because the Windows Update logs are godawful to deal with.
