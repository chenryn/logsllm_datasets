User: Please design a simple network monitoring system, including network topology diagram, server health status and log records of all devices.
Assistant: Network monitoring system design: 1. Network topology diagram: Use network topology software to draw a network topology diagram, and mark the IP address, device model, and device operating status of each device on the diagram. Network administrators can intuitively understand the structure of the entire network and the connection status between devices through the topology map. 2. Server monitoring: Monitor each server by deploying an agent program or using the SNMP protocol to obtain real-time occupancy of hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and disk, service operation status, and key indicators (such as response time, QPS, etc.), and The monitoring data is aggregated to the monitoring platform, through which the administrator can view the running status of the server in real time, and perform operations such as analysis and alarm on the monitoring data. 3. Device log records: collect and store the logs of each device by deploying a log collector or using the syslog protocol, including log data of various network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, and load balancing. Administrators can perform log query and statistical analysis through the monitoring platform to quickly troubleshoot network faults and security vulnerabilities. Generally speaking, a good network monitoring system should have the following characteristics: comprehensive, real-time, customizable, scalable, and easy to maintain. Only in this way can the security, stability and efficient operation of the network be guaranteed.
