User: How to deploy and manage containerized applications? Please list commonly used containerization tools, and provide corresponding use cases and operation guides.
Assistant: Containerized deployment and management methods: 1. Docker Compose: Define the relationship and startup parameters between multiple containers by writing YAML files, and start multiple container applications with one click. For example: ```yaml version: '3' services: web: build: . ports: - "5000:5000" redis: image: "redis:alpine" ``` start the application: ``` $ docker-compose up ` `` 2. Kubernetes: Define the deployment and management of container applications and resources by defining YAML files, and support automatic scaling, load balancing and other functions. For example: ```yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: myapp spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: myapp template: metadata: labels: app: myapp spec: containers: - name: myapp image: myapp:latest ports: - containerPort: 80 ``` Create and manage applications: ``` $ kubectl create deployment myapp --image=myapp:latest $ kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=3 ``` 3. Docker Swarm: Deploy and manage container applications on multiple Docker hosts, supporting automatic load balancing and failure recovery. For example: ``` $ docker swarm init $ docker service create --name myapp --replicas 3 myapp:latest ``` To list all services and view status: ``` $ docker service ls $ docker service ps myapp ``` 4. Rancher: It is an open source containerization platform that supports the use of Docker and Kubernetes to manage container applications, and provides a web interface and CLI tools. For example: Create a Kubernetes cluster: ``` $ rancher kubectl create deployment myapp --image=myapp:latest $ rancher kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=3 ``` Commonly used containers include Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and Rancher.
