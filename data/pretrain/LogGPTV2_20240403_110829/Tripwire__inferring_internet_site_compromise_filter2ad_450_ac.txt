Table 2: Summary of sites with detected login activity. Rank at
registration time rounded up to nearest 500. No ‘hard’ account
was registered at site P.
6.1 Sites compromised
For each site, Table 2 shows the approximate Alexa rank, site cat-
egory, the number of accounts created and accessed, and whether
an account with a hard password was accessed. We explore what
site characteristics appear to correlate with their compromise, how
sites manage their account databases, and which compromises we
detected were also disclosed by the sites themselves.
Overall, we find that while most of detected compromises are at
small sites with few staff, Tripwire has also detected compromises
on large sites as well. Tripwire detected both plaintext and hashed-
password breaches, and has predominantly discovered breaches that
have previously been undisclosed.
The most popular site compromised is a well-known American
startup with more than 45 million active customers as of the quarter
they were compromised (Site A). Sites E and F, owned by the same
parent company, are a large gaming-services company well known
within online gaming communities. We also detected compromise
on a top-500 site in India, the top-ranked site in its category (Site
I) which claims millions of installs of their app and more than 60
million visits to their site per month. Site P, a ‘tube’-style pornogra-
phy site, is a top-400 site in Germany. Site Q is owned by a company
with a large portfolio of travel recommendation websites, claim-
ing 40 million views across all sites every month.4 Finally, site S,
bitcointalk.org, is a prominent Bitcoin discussion forum that
experienced a publicly acknowledged database breach in May of
2015. Contents of that breach were reportedly sold online in 2016.
While the distribution looks somewhat skewed towards lower-ranked
sites, there are too few sites to observe the distribution definitively.
The compromised sites comprise a variety of site categories, al-
though gaming (i.e., sports or video games) is the most prevalent.
These sites are fairly representative of sites with large user bases
towards the tail of popularity.
Except sites A, E/F, Q and R, the remaining sites appear to be
run by individuals or small teams. A few of the sites have not been
meaningfully updated in several years, and site C has since disabled
account registration. Most of the sites appear to have been created
with good intentions for their stated purpose. Three sites (G, K, M),
though not malicious per se, appear to have been created explicitly
to generate ad revenue and offer services with little actual value.
6.1.2 Password management. The password strengths of the
accounts provide insight into the password management practices of
4We did not register at any other sites owned by this company, so cannot speculate
whether the compromise is limited to that site or spans across their properties.

the sites. For sites that only store hashed passwords, easy passwords
can be guessed using dictionary attacks while hard passwords remain
protected. For sites that store passwords in plain text, both easy and
hard passwords are vulnerable.
In eight cases (sites B, C, E, F, L, N, O, S), our system registered
for both an ‘easy’ and a ‘hard’ account at a site, but logins only
occurred on the ‘easy’ accounts. This behavior suggests that these
sites hash passwords sufficiently to at least delay the compromise
of accounts with stronger passwords, or are leaking account creden-
tials due to large-scale brute-forcing. Despite well-known security
practices, we observed logins using ‘hard’ passwords on ten sites
(including site A). These sites appear to have stored account pass-
words in the clear or used easily-reversed hashes. (For site P, we
only successfully registered an account with an easy password.)
Our methodology only registered for accounts with easy pass-
words after it estimated that a hard registration succeeded. This
biases our results to under-report compromises, as ‘easy’ passwords
are more frequently compromised. Subsequent invocations of a Trip-
wire system should avoid this pitfall.
6.1.3 Breach indicators. Of the 19 sites that we detected as
being compromised, we found only three with external indications
of compromise.
As mentioned above, site A is a well-known, popular American
startup. Around the time of our observed logins, several of their
users on Twitter complained of their accounts on site A being com-
promised. One publication ran a story discussing the claims, but
the site denied the allegations. We can find no further reporting on
the issue, but our account logins on site A corroborate these reports,
show evidence of attackers using stolen account information for
password reuse attacks, and serves as an example of our system
providing ground-truth evidence. Section 6.3 details our discussions
with the site when we disclosed our account compromises; from
their investigations, they reported finding no internal evidence of a
site compromise but could provide no explanation for our results.
We also found a post on an unrelated forum claiming to provide
a link to the user database of site L, a pornographic ‘tube’-style
site. We were unable to verify the availability of the database or the
validity of the claim, but the posting time is consistent with the login
attempts we see on account l1.
Finally, we detected an account compromise on site S, bitcoin
talk.org. This site was known to be compromised as of May
2015, and there were subsequent reports of the database of hashed
passwords being for sale on underground markets in 2016. Our
detections are consistent with this timeframe, and consistent with
the leak of hashed passwords [26].
We could find no evidence of disclosure of any of the other com-
promises. We provided the usernames we used on sites A–O to sev-
eral major threat intelligence companies and online service providers
in possession of large collections of compromised accounts, and
none of the companies found any evidence of breaches.5 We also
searched a variety of public and private sources of compromised
database dumps for evidence of our breaches without success.
6.1.4 Recovery from compromise. Although we found only
three external indicators of account breaches, most of the sites appear

to have either only been compromised at a single point in time, or
were able to recover from the breaches. We registered for additional
accounts on all sites except C (which no longer accepts registrations)
and O-R (whose compromises had not yet been detected) as of mid-
May 2016. To date, only our additional account at site H has been
accessed and none others.
6.2 Undetected compromises
It is natural with a system like Tripwire to want to calculate the
proportion of compromises that Tripwire is able to detect (i.e. re-
call). Unfortunately, such a calculation is not possible in practice,
as it is not possible to generate an accurate number of total compro-
mises that have occurred in the open Internet. Further, Tripwire does
not attempt to detect all compromises—it merely aims to expose
compromises that otherwise would have gone undetected. It is still
valuable, however, to understand why our implementation fails to
detect an otherwise known breach. In this section we explore why
Tripwire did not detect 50 recent data breaches as listed on a site
that curates public data breaches [11] and, for each, examined why
Tripwire did not detect a compromise.
6.2.1 Missed due to scale/scope. In 22 of 50 cases, the sites in-
volved with the compromise were ranked too low according to Alexa
to make our test corpus, despite many sites being quite large. Choos-
ing sites to target is a non-trivial problem. While Alexa provides
high-quality rankings for the most popular sites, our experience has
shown it to be less reliable for the long tail of the distribution.
In seven instances, the sites involved with the compromise were
not in English (six were Chinese-language sites and one was Rus-
sian). In both cases, a larger-scale and language-agnostic deployment
of Tripwire may have been able to register for accounts without is-
sue.
6.2.2 Missed due to technical challenge. In 14 of the 50 cases,
the sites were missed due to limitations of the Tripwire prototype. In
five cases, the crawler failed because it was not designed to handle
multi-page registration forms. In four additional cases, the crawler
failed a bot-detection check (e.g., a CAPTCHA image or a free-
form common-knowledge question). In one case we successfully
registered, but failed to properly verify the accounts by clicking on
links sent to the email address.
In four cases, the crawler was unable to locate the registration
page either due to it not being clearly accessible from the home page
of the site, or because the registration page was not obvious based
on the text of the page (e.g., because they relied on text embedded
in images). These cases represent significant technical challenges
which any implementation is likely to struggle with; however, they
are not fundamentally at odds with the Tripwire approach either. For
this limitation, it may be possible to rely on search engines to help
locate the registration pages.
6.2.3 Missed due to inherent limitations. In six cases, Trip-
wire could not have registered for accounts either because the site
required payment (two cases), or because the site did not support
online registrations (four cases) because accounts are established
by external means (e.g., being a customer of a bank). In one case,
the site limited the length of the email address to fewer than 16
characters but the address we tried was 18 characters. These sites
Tripwire

are largely out of scope for Tripwire. While technically possible to
automate payment, it is quite difficult to scale. Sites that have login
systems but that do not support purely-online registration (e.g., many
banks) are similarly out of scope.
6.3 Disclosure
Given the significance of account breaches, we contacted all sites
from which attackers had gained access to our accounts (except for
one case where the breach became publicly known). We disclosed
our identities, methodology, and findings, and engaged with each
site to the extent that they were willing. Although each site had its
own unique situation, we can summarize our findings as follows:
• Six of eighteen sites responded to our disclosures.
• Sites that did respond typically responded quickly and took
• Only one site directly corroborated a breach, and the com-
promise was previously known to them. Some sites acknowl-
edged that security was not their highest priority. No sites that
disputed our claim were able to explain how our accounts
could otherwise have been compromised.
• No sites have notified users to date (although one site said
the disclosures seriously.
they would force a password reset).
6.3.1 Disclosure Methodology. We disclosed to sites in two
batches, with most occurring on September 7th, 2016, and sites
compromised after that date on November 4th, 2016.
The first message we sent identified ourselves as researchers,
explained that we believed that usernames and passwords at the site
had been compromised, that we were willing to discuss details with
the appropriate party, and asked if such a person could respond. We
chose this phrasing both to provide confidence and to encourage a
response. If we received a response from the site, we sent a second
message explaining our methodology and some details of the specific
compromise. Subsequent messages, and phone calls if requested,
were answered as needed.
We chose recipient email addresses by looking for contact infor-
mation on the site, emailing the registrants listed in WHOIS data, and
emailing common email addresses that might be relevant (e.g. ‘secu-
PI:EMAIL’, ‘PI:EMAIL’). No site provided
an obvious direct method for contacting the appropriate security con-
tact. In each case, we emailed the complete set of addresses in case
any individual address was invalid. We sent messages from the first
author’s institutional email address, with other authors’ institutional
addresses CC’d.
6.3.2 Sites without responses. Twelve sites — B, D, H, I, J, K,
M, N, P, Q and R — did not respond to messages. Though we found
additional contact information for a number of the sites, these mes-
sages also did not receive a response. A message to site I resulted in
an automatic creation of an account at their internal ticketing system,
but no response was ever generated. Site J had no MX record. Site
M’s email was forwarded to another domain that had expired and was
purchased by a domain squatter. For site M, we also sent email to an
email-to-SMS gateway address used as a contact in their WHOIS
records.
6.3.3 Site A (Deals, Alexa rank 500). The head of security at
site A responded within 10 minutes of our initial notification asking
for details. Per their preference, most subsequent communications
with them were either PGP encrypted or by phone.
Site A asked if we were willing to sign a mutual NDA, which we
declined. Per their request, the authors met over the phone with the
head of security of site A, an additional engineer, and a member of
their in-house counsel. During this call, their head of security asked
questions to vet the process of detection and our methodology.
Site A understandably lamented the significant delay between
initial compromise and notification—an artifact of our specific mea-
surement implementation, and worse for site A than for other sites.
The operators of site A reported that, after our initial disclosure,
they employed a third-party incident response team to investigate.
Despite both internal and third-party efforts, they were unable to
find internal evidence of the breach, but did not have an alternative
explanation for how our accounts were compromised. Site A did
acknowledge that they were aware of the article we made reference
to in Section 6.1.3.
6.3.4 Site C (BitTorrent, Alexa rank 5500). Six days after
notification, we received a request for more information, and the
subsequent conversation provided details from the operator of site C.
The operator explained that an attacker had managed to compromise
the site sufficiently to create a competing clone in 2016. Our notifi-
cation was the first indication to the site owner that the vulnerability
had been used prior to 2016.
Site C’s owner explained that until this year, passwords were
simply hashed with MD5. When asked about whether they would
be disclosing the attack to users, they indicated that there was no
need, given that ‘this information has already become public sine the
hacker started a sote fork some months ago’ [sic]. When asked about
any technical countermeasures, the owner responded with ‘sorry
cannot tell. however be assured user are protected well’.
6.3.5 Sites E and F (Gaming, Alexa ranks 16000, 18500).
Within 30 minutes of the initial message to the owner of sites E
and F, the primary author received a voicemail from the in-house
counsel of the company attempting to verify our identities. Our initial
notification message did not include telephone contact information
for the author, but that information was readily available via online
search. Shortly after the initial voice message, we received an email
message asking us to confirm via phone that we had indeed sent the
message, and to read their responsible disclosure policy.
We received a follow-up from the head of security at the immedi-
ate parent company explaining that they were unable to corroborate
the data from our study with any of their internal information, and
expressed understandable frustration that so much time had passed
between event and notification.
The company was very interested in obtaining all related informa-
tion available, including communicating with the email provider. We
provided them with timestamps and IP addresses associated with all
relevant logins. Pages on their sites list usernames, and the company
asked if these could have been used by an attacker to brute-force
guess passwords either at the sites or the email provider. While our
email provider provides checking against brute-forcing, sites E and
F do not. But if indeed this is what occurred, then it represents a
compromise consistent with Tripwire’s goals.

6.3.6 Site G (RSS Feeds, Alexa rank 17500). The owner of
site G responded three days after notification inquiring about our
dataset. Upon explaining our data and methodology, the owner re-
sponded that, after looking for a while, he did find some SQL com-
mands that were improperly escaped, and he knew that his server
was under constant SSH brute-forcing attempts, but that he had not
been aware of any prior breach. The owner also explained that he
needed to update his installation of WordPress and that he would
force a password reset after he had finished development. To date, a
required password reset has yet to occur.
6.3.7 Site L (Adult, Alexa rank 11000). The owner/admin of
Site L explained that he had started the site in 2007. Although he
personally had ‘a low level of IT knowledge’, in April of 2015 he
got rid of his system administrators due to their cost and because
he felt they were making his job harder, not easier. Before recently
migrating to a cloud provider, his site ran on approximately sixty
dedicated servers. Since removing his system administrators, he has
been running the site himself, and that ‘being thrown in the deep end
is an understatement’.
