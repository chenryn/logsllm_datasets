### 2. Summary of Sites with Detected Login Activity

Table 2 provides a summary of the sites where login activity was detected. The table includes the approximate Alexa rank, site category, and whether an account with a strong password (referred to as a "hard" password) was accessed. The ranks are rounded up to the nearest 500. No "hard" account was registered at site P.

| Site | Alexa Rank | Category | Hard Password Accessed? |

### 3. Sites Compromised

For each site, Table 2 shows the approximate Alexa rank, site category, and whether an account with a hard password was accessed. We explore the characteristics of compromised sites, their account management practices, and whether the compromises were disclosed by the sites themselves.

#### 3.1 Overall Findings

We find that while most detected compromises occurred at smaller sites with few staff, Tripwire also detected breaches on larger, more popular sites. Tripwire identified both plaintext and hashed-password breaches, with many of these breaches previously undisclosed.

- **Site A**: A well-known American startup with over 45 million active customers.
- **Sites E and F**: Owned by the same parent company, a large gaming-services firm.
- **Site I**: A top-500 site in India, claiming millions of app installs and over 60 million monthly visits.
- **Site P**: A top-400 adult site in Germany.
- **Site Q**: Owned by a company with a large portfolio of travel recommendation websites, claiming 40 million monthly views.
- **Site S (bitcointalk.org)**: A prominent Bitcoin discussion forum that experienced a publicly acknowledged database breach in May 2015.

The distribution of compromised sites is somewhat skewed towards lower-ranked sites, but the sample size is too small to draw definitive conclusions. Gaming sites (e.g., sports or video games) are the most prevalent among the compromised sites.

#### 3.2 Site Characteristics

- **Small Teams**: Except for sites A, E/F, Q, and R, the remaining sites appear to be run by individuals or small teams.
- **Inactive Sites**: Some sites have not been meaningfully updated in several years, and site C has disabled account registration.
- **Ad Revenue Focus**: Three sites (G, K, M) were created primarily to generate ad revenue, offering services with little actual value.

#### 3.3 Password Management

The password strengths of the accounts provide insight into the password management practices of the sites. For sites that only store hashed passwords, easy passwords can be guessed using dictionary attacks, while hard passwords remain protected. For sites that store passwords in plain text, both easy and hard passwords are vulnerable.

- **Eight Sites (B, C, E, F, L, N, O, S)**: Registered for both an easy and a hard account, but logins only occurred on the easy accounts. This suggests that these sites hash passwords sufficiently to delay the compromise of stronger passwords or are leaking credentials due to brute-forcing.
- **Ten Sites (including A)**: Logins using hard passwords were observed, indicating that these sites stored passwords in plaintext or used easily-reversed hashes.

Our methodology only registered for accounts with easy passwords after estimating that a hard registration succeeded, which may under-report compromises.

#### 3.4 Breach Indicators

Of the 19 sites detected as compromised, only three had external indications of compromise:

- **Site A**: Users reported compromised accounts on Twitter, but the site denied the allegations. Our account logins corroborate these reports.
- **Site L**: A post on an unrelated forum claimed to provide a link to the user database. The posting time is consistent with our observed login attempts.
- **Site S (bitcointalk.org)**: Known to be compromised in May 2015, with subsequent reports of the database being sold in 2016. Our detections are consistent with this timeframe.

No evidence of disclosure was found for the other compromises. We provided usernames to major threat intelligence companies and online service providers, but none found evidence of breaches.

#### 3.5 Recovery from Compromise

Most sites appear to have either been compromised at a single point in time or were able to recover from the breaches. We registered for additional accounts on all sites except C (which no longer accepts registrations) and O-R (whose compromises had not yet been detected). As of mid-May 2016, only the additional account at site H has been accessed.

### 4. Undetected Compromises

It is challenging to calculate the proportion of compromises that Tripwire can detect. We explored why Tripwire did not detect 50 recent data breaches listed on a public data breach curation site [11].

#### 4.1 Missed Due to Scale/Scope

- **Alexa Ranking**: In 22 cases, the sites were ranked too low according to Alexa.
- **Language**: Seven sites were not in English (six Chinese, one Russian).

#### 4.2 Missed Due to Technical Challenges

- **Multi-Page Forms**: Five sites had multi-page registration forms.
- **Bot Detection**: Four sites failed bot-detection checks.
- **Email Verification**: One site required email verification, which we failed to complete.
- **Registration Page Location**: Four sites had registration pages that were not clearly accessible or obvious.

#### 4.3 Missed Due to Inherent Limitations

- **Payment Required**: Two sites required payment.
- **External Registration**: Four sites did not support online registration.
- **Email Length**: One site limited the email address length to fewer than 16 characters.

### 5. Disclosure

Given the significance of account breaches, we contacted all sites from which attackers gained access to our accounts (except for one case where the breach became publicly known).

#### 5.1 Disclosure Methodology

We disclosed to sites in two batches, with most occurring on September 7th, 2016, and sites compromised after that date on November 4th, 2016. The first message identified us as researchers, explained the potential compromise, and requested a response. If we received a response, we sent a second message explaining our methodology and specific details.

#### 5.2 Sites Without Responses

Twelve sites (B, D, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R) did not respond to messages. Additional contact information for some sites also did not yield responses.

#### 5.3 Site A (Deals, Alexa rank 500)

- **Response Time**: Head of security responded within 10 minutes.
- **Communication**: Most communications were PGP encrypted or by phone.
- **NDA Request**: Site A asked for a mutual NDA, which we declined.
- **Investigation**: They employed a third-party incident response team but could not find internal evidence of the breach. They acknowledged the article referenced in Section 6.1.3.

#### 5.4 Site C (BitTorrent, Alexa rank 5500)

- **Response Time**: Six days after notification.
- **Compromise Details**: An attacker compromised the site to create a competing clone in 2016. Passwords were hashed with MD5 until recently.
- **Disclosure**: The owner indicated no need to disclose the attack, given it was already public.

#### 5.5 Sites E and F (Gaming, Alexa ranks 16000, 18500)

- **Response Time**: Within 30 minutes.
- **Verification**: In-house counsel verified our identities via phone.
- **Investigation**: Unable to corroborate our data with internal information. Interested in obtaining all related information and communicating with the email provider.

#### 5.6 Site G (RSS Feeds, Alexa rank 17500)

- **Response Time**: Three days after notification.
- **Findings**: Owner found improperly escaped SQL commands and constant SSH brute-forcing attempts. Promised to update WordPress and force a password reset, which has not yet occurred.

#### 5.7 Site L (Adult, Alexa rank 11000)

- **Response Time**: Prompt response.
- **Background**: Started in 2007, run by an individual with low IT knowledge. Removed system administrators in 2015, now running the site himself.

This structured and detailed approach provides a clear and professional overview of the findings and processes involved in the study.
