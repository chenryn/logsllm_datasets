Removing the Server From Its Packaging
To protect its precision components, the server is shipped in special packaging, with a 
temporary plastic faceplate covering its front panel. You need to remove this faceplate before 
opening the server or installing it in a rack.
Xserve is speciﬁcally designed for rack mounting. It is not designed for use as a desktop 
computer.
Note:  
If at all possible, work with another person when handling the server.
Follow these steps to remove the server from its carton and remove the faceplate.
1
Open the carton, remove any foam or other packaging, and fold back the plastic covering the 
server.
2
With one person holding the server on each side, carefully lift the unit and place it on a table.
Warning  
Do not place a monitor or any other equipment on top of the server. Any 
weight on the server’s case could damage the components inside the unit.

Considerations for Multiple Xserve Systems in a Rack
Because your Xserve system is designed for use with other Xserve units and additional 
components in a rack, you must plan and provide adequate resources for all of these units. 
Consider the combined requirements of your Xserve systems and other components for:
m
Electrical power and backup power
m
Operating environment
m
Access to the front and back of each system, as well as room to open the Xserve systems
m
Orderly management of cables for multiple components
m
Stability of the rack
m
Security for the rack’s location
See Chapter 2, “Preparing to Install Your Server,” in the 
Xserve User’s Guide
 for more 
information about planning the installation of your Xserve systems.
Also consult the documentation for each additional component and for the rack to be certain 
that your installation and resources meet their combined requirements.
Where to Find Instructions for Xserve Hardware and 
Software
Your server comes with several documents that provide instructions for installing and 
maintaining the hardware, setting up the software, and monitoring and adjusting the server’s 
operation. This section includes a description of each of the server documents.
In addition to this “quick start” booklet, the server’s learning materials include the following 
documents and reference sources.
Note:  
The system CD that came with the server contains electronic documentation in 
PDF format.
