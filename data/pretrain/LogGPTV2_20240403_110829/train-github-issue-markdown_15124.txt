The LessCSS bug has been around for years. It's easy to replicate and easy to
work around. Many people have reported it to the LessCSS project, but the
official LessCSS project seems largely uninterested in community development.
Issues go ignored and pull requests aren't accepted. Anyway, here's the issue:
## Short description:
CSS properties are duplicated when @importing multiple times (nested @import).
## Issues on LessCSS repo (all the same issue):
less/less.js#49  
less/less.js#71  
less/less.js#324
## The pull request that would fix the issue for LessCSS:
less/less.js#431
## How it effects Initializr when using responsive.less:
Here's a cut-and-paste from generated CSS from a standard bootstrap style.css
    textarea {
    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 13px;
      font-weight: normal;
      line-height: 18px;
      font-size: 13px;
      font-weight: normal;
      line-height: 18px;
      font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      font-size: 13px;
      font-weight: normal;
      line-height: 18px;
      font-size: 13px;
      font-weight: normal;
      line-height: 18px;
    }
## The workaround:
Basically, completely avoid using an import of an import. For me, it meant
essentially getting rid of bootstrap.less and responsive.less (and removing
the includes of variables.less and mixins.less from responsive.less) and
putting all includes in my main style.less file. Not the prettiest solution,
but it works.
## Thoughts?
Some people have reported their CSS files ballooning up to > 3mb mb because of
all the duplicate rules generated. Before I go reorganizing the imports to
avoid this issue for responsive.less, I thought I'd gather feedback/consensus
and make sure this worth doing.
