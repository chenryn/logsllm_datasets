Abstract. Detecting fake users (also called Sybils) in online social net-
works is a basic security research problem. State-of-the-art approaches
rely on a large amount of manually labeled users as a training set. These
approaches suﬀer from three key limitations: (1) it is time-consuming
and costly to manually label a large training set, (2) they cannot detect
new Sybils in a timely fashion, and (3) they are vulnerable to Sybil
attacks that leverage information of the training set. In this work, we
propose SybilBlind, a structure-based Sybil detection framework that
does not rely on a manually labeled training set. SybilBlind works under
the same threat model as state-of-the-art structure-based methods. We
demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of SybilBlind using (1) a social network
with synthetic Sybils and (2) two Twitter datasets with real Sybils. For
instance, SybilBlind achieves an AUC of 0.98 on a Twitter dataset.

1 Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) are known to be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in
which attackers maintain a large number of fake users (also called Sybils). For
instance, 10% of Twitter users were fake [1]. Attackers can leverage Sybils to per-
form various malicious activities such as manipulating presidential election [15],
inﬂuencing stock market [16], distributing spams and phishing URLs [24], etc.
Therefore, Sybil detection in OSNs is an important research problem.
Indeed, Sybil detection has attracted increasing attention from multiple
research communities such as security, networking, and data mining. Among
various approaches, structure-based ones [6–8,11,14,18,26,28,30,33,36–39] have
demonstrated promising results. For instance, SybilRank [7] and Integro [6]
were deployed to detect a large amount of Sybils in Tuenti, the largest OSN
in Spain. SybilSCAR [30] was shown to be eﬀective and eﬃcient in detecting
Sybils in Twitter. State-of-the-art structure-based approaches adopt the follow-
ing machine learning paradigm: they ﬁrst require an OSN provider to collect

a large manually labeled training set consisting of labeled benign users and/or
labeled Sybils; then they learn a model to distinguish between benign users and
Sybils; ﬁnally, the model is used to detect Sybils.
Such paradigm of relying on a manually labeled training set suﬀers from three
key limitations. First, it is time-consuming and costly to obtain a large manu-
ally labeled training set. We note that OSN providers could outsource manual
labeling to crowdsourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk [32]. However,
crowdsourcing manual labeling requires disclosing user information to “turk-
ers”, which raises privacy concerns. Moreover, attackers could act as “turkers”
to adversarially mislabel users. OSNs often allow users to ﬂag other users as
Sybils. However, similar to crowdsourcing, Sybils could adversarially mislabel
benign users as Sybils. Second, attackers can launch new Sybil attacks when the
old ones were taken down. It takes time for human workers to manually label a
training set for the new attacks. As a result, some benign users might already be
attacked before the new attacks were detected. Third, using a manually labeled
training set makes these approaches vulnerable to Sybil attacks that leverage the
information of the training set [21]. The key intuition is that once an attacker
knows or infers the training set, he can perform better attacks over time. Our
method is secure against such attacks as it does not rely on labeled users.
Our Work: In this work, we propose SybilBlind, a structure-based framework,
to detect Sybils without relying on a manually labeled training set, under the
same threat model as state-of-the-art structure-based methods (See Sect. 3.2).
Our key idea is to sample some users from an OSN, randomly assign labels (i.e.,
benign or Sybil) to them, and treat them as if they were a training set without
actually manually labeling them. Such randomly sampled training set could have
various levels of label noise, where a user’s randomly assigned label is noisy if
it is diﬀerent from the user’s true label. Then, we take the noisy training set
as an input to a state-of-the-art Sybil detection method (e.g., SybilSCAR [30]
in our experiments) that is relatively robust to label noise (i.e., performance
does not degrade much with a relatively low fraction of noisy labels) to detect
Sybils. We deﬁne a sampling trial as the process that we randomly sample a
noisy training set and use a state-of-the-art Sybil detection method to detect
Sybils via taking the sampled training set as an input. Since state-of-the-art
Sybil detection methods can only accurately detect Sybils in the sampling trials
where the sampled training sets have relatively low label noise, we repeat for
multiple sampling trials and we design an aggregator to aggregate the results in
the multiple sampling trials.
A key challenge of our SybilBlind framework is how to aggregate the results
in multiple sampling trials. For instance, one natural aggregator is to average
the results in multiple sampling trials. Speciﬁcally, in each sampling trial, we
have a probability of being a Sybil for each user. We average the probabilities
over multiple sampling trials for each user and use the averaged probability to
classify a user to be benign or Sybil. However, we demonstrate, both theoret-
ically and empirically, that such average aggregator achieves an accuracy that
230

is close to random guessing. To address the aggregation challenge, we design a
novel aggregator. Speciﬁcally, we design two new metrics called homophily and
one-side entropy. In a sampling trial where Sybils are accurately detected, both
homophily and one-side entropy are large. With the two metrics, our aggregator
identiﬁes the sampling trials in which the sampled training sets have low label
noise and Sybils are accurately detected. Then, we compute an aggregated prob-
ability of being a Sybil for every user from these sampling trials and use the
aggregated probabilities to detect Sybils.
We evaluate SybilBlind both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we
analyze the required number of sampling trials. Empirically, we perform eval-
uations using (1) a social network with synthesized Sybils, (2) a small Twitter
dataset (8K users and 68K edges) with real Sybils, and (3) a large Twitter dataset
(42M users and 1.2 B edges) with real Sybils. Our results demonstrate that Sybil-
Blind is accurate, e.g., on the small Twitter dataset, SybilBlind achieves an AUC
of 0.98. Moreover, we adapt a community detection method and state-of-the-
art Sybil detection method SybilSCAR [30] to detect Sybils when a manually
labeled training set is unavailable. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
SybilBlind substantially outperforms these adapted methods.
Our key contributions are summarized as follows:

2.1 Structure-Based Approaches
One category of Sybil detection approaches leverage the global structure of the
social network [6–9,11,14,18,26,28–30,33,36–39]. These approaches require a
manually labeled training dataset, from which they propagate label information
among the social network via leveraging the social structure.
Using Random Walks or Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP): Many
structure-based approaches [6–8,18,36,38,39] leverage random walks to prop-
agate label information. SybilGuard [39], SybilLimit [38], and SybilInfer [8] only
require one labeled benign user. However, they achieve limited performance and
are not scalable to large-scale OSNs. SybilRank [7] and ´Integro [6] are state-of-
the-art random walk based approaches, and they were successfully applied to
detect a large amount of Sybils in Tuenti, the largest OSN in Spain. However,

they require a large number of manually labeled benign users; and ´Integro even
further requires a large number of labeled victims and non-victims, which were
used to learn a binary victim-prediction classiﬁer. A user is said to be a vic-
tim if the user is connected with at least a Sybil. SybilBelief [14], Fu et al. [9],
GANG [28], and SybilFuse [11] leverage probabilistic graphical model techniques.
Speciﬁcally, they model a social network as a pairwise Markov Random Fields.
Given a training dataset, they leverage LBP to infer the label of each remaining
user.
Recently, Wang et al. [29,30] proposed a local rule based framework to unify
random walk and LBP based approaches. Under this framework, a structure-
based Sybil detection method essentially iteratively applies a certain local rule
to each user to propagate label information. Diﬀerent Sybil detection methods
use diﬀerent local rules. Moreover, they also proposed a new local rule, based
on which they designed SybilSCAR that achieves state-of-the-art performance
both theoretically and empirically. For instance, SybilSCAR achieves the tightest
asymptotic bound on the number of Sybils per attack edge that can be injected
into a social network without being detected [29]. However, as we demonstrate
in our experiments on Twitter, SybilSCAR requires a large training dataset in
order to achieve an accurate Sybil detection performance.
Using Community Detection Algorithms: Viswanath et al. [26] showed
that Sybil detection can be cast as a community detection problem. The
authors found that detecting local community around a labeled benign user
had equivalent results to approaches such as SybilLimit and SybilInfer. Cao et
al. [7] showed that SybilRank signiﬁcantly outperforms community detection
approaches. Moreover, Alvisi et al. [2] demonstrated a vulnerability of the local
community detection algorithm adopted by Viswanath et al. [26] by carefully
designing an attack.
Summary: State-of-the-art structure-based approaches (e.g., SybilRank, Sybil-
Belief, and SybilSCAR) require a large manually labeled training dataset. These
approaches suﬀer from three key limitations as we discussed in Introduction.
2.2 Other Approaches
Approaches in this direction [4,10,19,22–24,27,31,35,37] leverage various user-
generated contents (e.g., tweets), behaviors (e.g., the frequency of sending
tweets), and local social structures (e.g., how a user’s friends are connected).
Most studies in this direction [4,10,22–24,27] treat Sybil detection as a super-
vised learning problem; they extract various features from user-generated con-
tents, behaviors, and local social structures, and they learn machine learning
classiﬁers using a training dataset; the learnt classiﬁers are then used to classify
each remaining user to be benign or Sybil. For instance, Yang et al. [37] proposed
local social structure based features such as the frequency that a user sends friend
requests to others, the fraction of outgoing friend requests that are accepted, and
232

the clustering coeﬃcient of a user. One limitation of these approaches is that
Sybils can manipulate users’ proﬁles to evade detection. For instance, a Sybil can
link to many Sybils to manipulate its local social structure as desired. However,
although these approaches are easy to evade, we believe that they can be used as
a ﬁrst layer to ﬁlter some basic Sybils and increase attackers’ costs of perform-
ing Sybil attacks. Moreover, these approaches are complementary to approaches
that leverage global social structures, and they can be used together in practice.
For instance, we can treat the outputs of these approaches as users’ prior prob-
abilities. Then, we can leverage structure-based methods, e.g., SybilSCAR [30],
to detect Sybils by iteratively propagating the priors among a social network.
3 Problem Deﬁnition
3.1 Structure-Based Sybil Detection Without Manual Labels
Suppose we are given an undirected social network G = (V, E),1 where a node
in V corresponds to a user in an OSN and an edge (u, v) represents a certain
relationship between u and v. For instance, on Facebook, an edge between u and
v could mean that u is in v’s friend list and vice versa. On Twitter, an edge
(u, v) could mean that u and v follow each other. We consider Sybil detection
without a manually labeled training dataset, which we call blind Sybil detection.
Deﬁnition 1 (Blind Sybil Detection). Suppose we are given a social net-
work. Blind Sybil detection is to classify each node to be benign or Sybil without
a manually labeled training dataset.
3.2 Threat Model
We call the subnetwork containing all benign nodes and edges between them the
benign region, and we call the subnetwork containing all Sybil nodes and edges
between them the Sybil region. The edges between the two regions are called
attack edges. We consider the following threat model, which is widely adopted
by existing structure-based methods.
Connected-Sybil Attacks: We consider that Sybils are connected among
themselves. In order to leverage Sybils to launch various malicious activities,
an attacker often needs to ﬁrst link his/her created Sybils to benign users. One
attack strategy is that each Sybil aggressively sends friend requests to a large
number of users (or follow a large number of users) that are randomly picked [37].
In these attacks, although some benign users (e.g., social capitalists [12]) will
accept such friend requests with a relatively high probability, making the Sybils
embed to the benign region, most benign users will not accept these friend
requests [12]. As a result, Sybils that are created using this attack strategy often
have low ratios of accepted friend requests (or ratios of being followed back), as

well as low clustering coeﬃcients because most users that link to a Sybil might
not be connected with each other. Therefore, such Sybils can be detected by
machine learning classiﬁers that use these structural features, as was shown by
Yang et al. [37] on RenRen, a large OSN in China.
In this paper, we consider that Sybils created by an attacker are connected
(i.e., connected-Sybil attack), so as to manipulate their structural features to
evade the detection of structural feature based classiﬁers. Such connected-Sybil
attacks were formally discussed by Alvisi et al.
[2], are required by previ-
ous structure-based methods [6–8,14,26,30,33,36,38,39]. Note that Sybils in
Tuenti [7], the largest OSN in Spain, are densely connected. Moreover, the
datasets we used in our experiments also show that most of the Sybils are con-
nected. For instance, in our large Twitter dataset, 85.3% Sybils are connected
to form a largest connected component with an average degree 24.
Limited Number of Attack Edges: Intuitively, most benign users would not
establish trust relationships with Sybils. We assume that the number of attack
edges is relatively smaller, compared to the number of edges in the benign region
and the Sybil region. This assumption is required by all previous structure-
based methods [6–8,14,26,30,33,36,38,39] except ´Integro [6]. ´Integro assumes
the number of victims (a victim is a node having attack edges) is small and
victims can be accurately detected. The number of attack edges in Tuenti was
shown to be relatively small [7]. Service providers can limit the number of attack
edges via approximating trust relationships between users, e.g., looking into
user interactions [34], inferring tie strengths [13], and asking users to rate their
social friends [33]. We note that in the large Twitter dataset we used in our
experiments, only 1.5% of the total edges are attack edges.
For connected-Sybil attacks, limited number of attack edges is equivalent to
the homophily assumption, i.e., if we randomly sample an edge (u, v) from the
social network, then u and v have the same label with high probability. In the
following, we use homophily and limited number of attack edges interchangeably.
Benign Users are More than Sybils: We assume that Sybils are less than
benign users in the OSN. An attacker often leverages only tens of thousands
of compromised hosts to create and manage Sybils [25]. If an attacker registers
and maintains a large number of Sybils on each compromised host, the OSN
provider can easily detect these Sybils via IP-based methods. In other words, to
evade detection by IP-based methods, each compromised host can only maintain
a limited number of Sybils. Indeed, Thomas et al. [25] found that a half of
compromised hosts under an attacker’s control maintain less than 10 Sybils. As
a result, in OSNs with tens or hundreds of millions of benign users, the number
of Sybils is smaller than that of benign users. For instance, it was reported that
