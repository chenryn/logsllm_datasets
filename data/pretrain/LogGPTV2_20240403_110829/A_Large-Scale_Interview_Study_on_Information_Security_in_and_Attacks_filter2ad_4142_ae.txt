5 Discussion
Below, we discuss our ﬁndings and, based on the ﬁndings,
outline recommendations for industry, governments and leg-
islators, as well as future research.
5.1 Key Findings
In relation to our research questions, we summarize the fol-
lowing key ﬁndings:
RQ1. “How do company employees perceive the risk of cy-
berattacks?” In general, our interviewees did not perceive a
high risk of cyberattacks for their companies. Notably, how-
ever, they generally perceived the risk of mass attacks higher
than the risk of targeted attacks – especially interviewees
working for smaller companies. The lower perceived risk
of targeted attacks might make them more susceptible to at-
tacks such CEO-Fraud, or targeted ransom ware attacks,e. g.
Emotet [9], as well as insider threats.
RQ2. “Which and how frequent are information security mea-
sures deployed in SMEs?” Most of our interviewees reported
the deployment of technical measures such as ﬁrewalls and
antivirus software compared to less frequently reported orga-
nizational measures such as certiﬁcations for information se-
curity. Furthermore, we found a high variance within reported
organizational measures, with measures that require regular
active engagement such information security training, risk
analysis, or emergency drills being less frequently reported.

companies in different ways. The interview results reﬂect the
complexity of companies, and illustrate that information secu-
rity is impacted by technological (e.g., maturity of measures),
organizational (e.g., company size, corporate culture or sector
speciﬁc security requirements) and individual (e.g., ability
and willingness to provide, process and share information)
characteristics of companies and their employees.
While our large-scale exploratory interview study illus-
trates of the impact of cybercrime on SMEs, it cannot provide
in-depth causal analyses of the phenomena we identiﬁed and
described in this work. Therefore, our study provides ground
truth for exciting future work based on 5,000 interviews.
We provide the following ideas for future work and rec-
ommendations: (i) we outline ideas for future research in the
context of cybercrime and SMEs based on our ﬁndings, (ii)
based on our ﬁndings we discuss recommendations for com-
panies to improve their information security, and (iii) provide
recommendations for governments and legislators.
For Researchers. Concerning follow-up work should inves-
tigate speciﬁc aspects of cybercrime and security measures
we detailed in Section 5.1. We strongly recommend to mind
the correlations we found between interviewee position in the
company and the reporting concerning both incidences and
measures, which is hard to work around for smaller compa-
nies, where some roles might be missing entirely. The strong
discrepancy between tech and management in both risk assess-
ment 4.2 and deployed measures 4.3 should be investigated
in future work. This extends to the low risk perception of
participants in general. 40% of the companies in our dataset
have experienced cybercrime that they had to actively counter
in the last 12 months. We suspect this could be caused by
misconceptions about what even qualiﬁes as cybercrime, by
low consequences resulting from most types of cybercrime or
by issues tracking the consequences of cybercrime in SMEs.
As a ﬁnal ﬁnding, we noticed outliers in the correlation of
industry sectors and incidents (cf. Figure 5). An in-depth
investigation could reveal how to improve security for these
sectors or adapt their approaches to other industry sectors.
Finally, future research could assess the maturity and internal
spread of technical security measures within organizations,
since technical measures had very high reporting rates (c.f.
Figure 4), but we suspect that the security impact of measures
like access control and ﬁrewall setup can vary widely based
on the implementation quality and maturity.
For Companies. While we do not have concrete recommen-
dations for security measurements, our results indicate a
strong correlation of organisational measures compared to
technical measures and low adoption as seen in Figure 4. For
companies, this indicates that they should look at organisa-
tional measures like information security policies and em-
ployee training and evaluate which of these make sense for
their business model. Especially measures like a security in-
cidence policy strongly correlate with reported incidences, as
seen in section 4.4. Another interesting tendency in our analy-
sis is that the risk sensitivity of the management generally was
rated higher than the sensitivity of company staff. This can
in part be attributed to bias when our interview partners held
management positions. Even with that in mind, the manage-
ment should spread this self-reported awareness to company
staff and provide opportunities to raise information security
awareness and participate in security training, especially for
staff not directly involved in tech.
For Governments/Legislators. Seeing how industry sectors
that tend to have high security requirements to upload by the
law (K: Finances & Insurance and D: Energy & Gas) have
a higher tendency to report fewer incidents despite strong
detection mechanisms, the government can play a strong role
in the security of small and medium enterprises. Legislators
could improve cybersecurity by focusing on the areas of in-
dustries with high incidence counts for certain attacks as seen
in Figure 5. For example requirements for industry sectors
like J:Communication to implement security measures against
(D)Dos attacks. Furthermore, our descriptive results in Sec-
tion 4.2 show that risk awareness and assessment is still low
and legislators should actively work on increasing awareness
for information security and the risks of cybercrime. In Ger-
many, we are already working to integrate results of the survey
into a platform that provides information security guidelines
and serves to raise risk awareness for German companies in
cooperation with a federal ministry.
6 Conclusion
In this work we investigated effects, mitigations, and risk
assessments of cybercrime in small and medium-sized com-
panies in Germany. We contributed what is to our knowledge
the ﬁrst analysis of German SMEs on this scale. Our ﬁndings
uncover that security awareness has arrived in all SMEs, but
this awareness is not yet spread to all staff, mostly left to
management and tech departments, which opens SMEs up
to phishing, insider attacks and advanced persistent threats.
We also discover positive effects likely related to legislation
for information security and use our results to formulate rec-
ommendations for employers, governments and future areas
of research. In conclusion, cybersecurity awareness in Ger-
many has arrived in SMEs, but the resulting measures and
assessment of risks are sub optimal and open enterprises up
to unnecessary attack surfaces.

A CATI Questionnaire
We provide a translation of the interview guide for our CATIs. It contains
the questions in the form of "Question? (Choices→ Factor in Regres-
sion [B:Baseline]), (Scale)". The response options “not speciﬁed” and
“I do not know” are given for any question, but not listed below. WZ08-
Classiﬁcation of the industries → Industry Sector [B:Construction] and
headcount bins → Headcount were adopted from the underlying commer-
cial sampling databases. For the full questions and supplementary material
of the survey, please refer to Section 3.3.
A.1 "Company" - Introduction
1. In which area do you work in your company [multiple answers possi-
ble]? → Interviewee Position
(Multiple Choice: Executive/Management Board, IT & Information
Security, Data Protection, Plant Security, Audit, External Service
Provider, Other [free text])
2. How high do you estimate the risk for your company to be harmed by
a cyber-attack in the next 12 months. . .
(. . . that also hits many other companies at the same time? [e.g. mass
sent malware], → Risk Assessment Untargeted;
. . . that exclusively affects your company? [e.g. targeted espionage
attack]); → Risk Assessment Targeted (Scale: Very low, Rather low,
Rather high, Very high)
A.2 "Incidence" - Detected cyber-attacks
1. Always related to the last 12 months: How often has your organization
been affected by and had to actively respond to the following types of
attacks?
(Ransomware - which was intended to encrypt company data, → Ran-
