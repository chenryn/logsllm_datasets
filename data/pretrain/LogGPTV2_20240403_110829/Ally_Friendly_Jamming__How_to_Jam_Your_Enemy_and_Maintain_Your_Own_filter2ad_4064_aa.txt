Abstract—This paper presents a novel mechanism, called
Ally Friendly Jamming, which aims at providing an intelligent
jamming capability that can disable unauthorized (enemy)
wireless communication but at
the same time still allow
authorized wireless devices to communicate, even if all these
devices operate at the same frequency. The basic idea is to
jam the wireless channel continuously but properly control the
jamming signals with secret keys, so that the jamming signals
are unpredictable interference to unauthorized devices, but are
recoverable by authorized ones equipped with the secret keys.
To achieve the ally friendly jamming capability, we develop
new techniques to generate ally jamming signals, to identify
and synchronize with multiple ally jammers. This paper
also reports the analysis, implementation, and experimental
evaluation of ally friendly jamming on a software deﬁned
radio platform. Both the analytical and experimental results
indicate that the proposed techniques can effectively disable
enemy wireless communication and at the same time maintain
wireless communication between authorized devices.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless communication technology has been widely de-
ployed and increasingly adopted due to the ease of instal-
lation and reduced operational cost. The applications that
beneﬁt from wireless communication range from traditional
military operations to more recent civilian applications such
as Wi-Fi and mobile phones. There have also been on-
going efforts aimed at adopting wireless communication
in emerging and mission-critical applications (e.g., health-
care [12], [18] and critical
infrastructure protection [6],
[10]).
In mission-critical applications such as battleﬁeld oper-
ations, anti-terrorism activities, and critical
infrastructure
protection, it is highly desirable and sometimes necessary
to gain advantages over the adversary in terms of wireless
communication capability. In particular, it is highly desirable
to disable the adversary’s (unauthorized) wireless communi-
cation while still maintaining our own (authorized) wireless
communication. For example, wireless communication has
been a common way to trigger Improvised Explosive De-
vices (IED) (a.k.a. roadside bombs), which were responsible
for approximately 63% coalition deaths in the second Iraq
war from 2001 to 2007 and over 66% of the coalition
casualties in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2012 [2]. The
capability of disabling enemy wireless communication and at
the same time maintaining coalition’s wireless connectivity
would greatly reduce the casualties due to radio-controlled
IED. It
is conceivable that such a capability will also
enhance the security of other non-military mission-critical
applications such as critical infrastructure protection and
health-care applications.
This paper aims at providing such a capability. Speciﬁ-
cally, we develop a novel mechanism, called Ally Friendly
Jamming, to provide an intelligent jamming capability that
can disable unauthorized (enemy) wireless communication
but at the same time still allow authorized wireless devices to
communicate, even if both the authorized and unauthorized
devices operate at the same frequency.
The basic idea behind ally friendly jamming is to jam
the wireless channel continuously but properly control the
jamming signals using secret keys, so that the jamming sig-
nals are unpredictable interference to unauthorized devices,
but are recoverable by authorized devices equipped with
the secret keys. As a result, when authorized devices need
to communicate, they can employ proper signal processing
techniques to remove the jamming signals and recover the
messages transmitted by other authorized devices. In other
words, authorized devices can regenerate jamming signals
using the secret keys and subtract them from the received,
mixed signals to get jamming-free transmissions.
Though conceptually simple, ally friendly jamming turns
out to be non-trivial to achieve. We have to resolve three
technical challenges to ensure effective jamming and at the
same time enable authorized devices to actually receive
messages under ally friendly jamming, even though such
devices know the secret keys.
First, to achieve ally friendly jamming, the ally jamming
signals need to be irresolvable interference to unauthorized
devices. Simply transmitting modulated pseudo random
numbers as jamming messages can be easily defeated due to
the strong patterns introduced by the digital communication

process (e.g., modulation) [15]. Thus, the jamming signals
injected by ally jammers must resemble real random noises.
In the proposed ally friendly jamming scheme, we introduce
the concept of epoch and use the shared keys with epoch
indices as the input of a pseudo random number generator to
directly control physical layer symbols, so that these signals
are random noises to unauthorized devices and easy for
authorized devices to synchronize with.
Second, an authorized receiver has to synchronize with
the ally jammers, so that it can estimate the ally jamming
signals, remove them from received signals, and recover
potential transmissions from authorized transmitters. Though
synchronization is a well-studied problem in digital com-
munication, synchronization in ally friendly jamming faces
a new challenge. As the channel and hardware effects
(e.g., frequency offset) on the received ally jamming signals
are unknown, the authorized receiver cannot synchronize
with ally jammers even though it can generate the same
transmitted ally jamming signals. The frequency offset can
be compensated for by using the phase-locked loop which
depends on the strong phase patterns existing in the transmit-
ted signals. As ally jamming signals mimic random noises,
no strong patterns can be relied on, existing synchronization
approaches (e.g., [11], [16], [28], [34]) cannot be applied
directly in ally friendly jamming. In this paper, we propose
to use the pilot frequency aided correlation to synchronize
authorized receivers with multiple ally jammers.
Third, when multiple ally jammers exist in the network, an
authorized receiver needs to ﬁrst identify these ally jammers
properly and then regenerate the transmitted ally jamming
signals in order to recover the authorized transmission. A
particular challenge lies in how to identify these ally jam-
mers rapidly while their ally jamming signals are pseudo-
random signals and the channel and hardware effects on
the received ally jamming signals are unknown. To solve
this problem, we propose to use the pilot frequency and the
fast Fourier transform (FFT) to identify ally jammers and
further compensate for the hardware difference effects on
the received signals.
accesses will be denied. Therefore, by providing solutions to
the above problems, our work further advances the current
state of the art in security enhancement through friendly
jamming.
We have implemented a prototype for ally friendly jam-
ming using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
platform [25] and GNURadio [1]. Our experimental results
show that under ally friendly jamming, authorized devices

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
We explore a new concept called ally friendly jamming that
can disable unauthorized wireless communication and at the
same time allow authorized devices to maintain wireless
connectivity. We develop new techniques to generate ally
jamming signals, to identify and synchronize with multiple
ally jammers. We have also implemented a prototype for
ally friendly jamming and performed analysis and extensive
experimental evaluation to validate the techniques.

II. PRELIMINARIES
Wireless digital communication systems generally em-
ploy radio frequency (RF) signals to transmit information.
Transmitters need to convert digital messages represented
in bits to RF signals, while receivers convert received RF
signals back to digital messages. Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed
structure for a wireless digital communication system with
one transmitter and one receiver. On the transmitter side,
upon receiving bits from upper layers, the transmitter ﬁrst
modulates them to discrete baseband signals (a.k.a. physical
layer symbols, or simply symbols), then converts them to
analog signals using a digital to analog converter (DAC),
and ﬁnally up-converts them to RF signals. The RF signals
go through the wireless channel and reach the receiver. Upon
receiving the RF signals, the receiver performs the inverse
processing. It down-converts and samples the received sig-
nals to discrete baseband signals, and then demodulates them
to bits.
Physical layer symbols are represented by complex num-
bers. For example, when BPSK is used for modulation,
the transmitter modulates bit “1” to x = 1 + 0j and bit
(cid:2) = −1 + 0j (j is the imaginary unit, satisfying
“0” to x
j2 = −1). A symbol xi = a + bj is often represented in its
A similar technique called IMD (Implantable Medical
Device) shield [12] was proposed recently which exploited
jamming to provide access control to an IMD. The IMD
shield is a small radio device that employs two antennas for
jamming and receiving, respectively. The receive antenna is
physically connected to a transmit (jam)-and-receive chain,
so that when sending a jamming signal, the jam chain can
inject an “antidote” signal to the receive antenna to cancel
the jamming signal. Due to the physical connection between
the jamming and the receiving antennas, IMD shield does
not have to deal with the synchronization challenge ad-
dressed in this paper. Moreover, the multiple-jammer case
was not considered in IMD shield. This means if multiple
IMD shields operate at the same time in the same area, their
jamming signals will interference with each other, and all

The wireless channel introduces attenuation, phase shift,
and additional noise during transmission. After the signal xi
is transmitted through the channel, it is transformed into the
received signal
yi = hejγxi + ni,
where h is the channel attenuation, γ is the phase shift, and
ni is the noise.
In practice, the signal reception at the receiver is also
affected by two additional factors: frequency offset and sam-
pling offset. Frequency offset Δf generally exists between
the transmitter and the receiver, since there is no practical
way to guarantee that two radios operate at exactly the same
frequency. Δf causes variations on the phases of received
signals [13]. Thus, if we take Δf into consideration, the
received signal becomes
yi = hejγej2πΔf ti xi + ni,
(1)
where ti is the time at which the receiver gets the sample
yi.
Moreover, the receiver uses sampling and quantization
to recover the original baseband signals. Due to the lack
of perfect synchronization in wireless communications, the
receiver usually cannot sample perfectly to get the exact
physical layer symbols sent by the transmitter. When the
sampling offset is considered, the received signal becomes
and authorized devices are loosely synchronized, and the fre-
quency offsets between ally jammers and authorized devices
are within a given range. We assume that ally jammers can
block the operational frequencies of all devices, including
both authorized and unauthorized devices. In other words,
unauthorized devices cannot ﬁnd a wireless communication
channel that is not being jammed by the ally jammers. We
also assume that the adversary cannot defeat ally friendly
jamming by physically removing ally jammers. Finally, we
assume that each device (authorized or unauthorized) is
equipped with a single omnidirectional antenna and there
is no adversarial jammer. How to accomplish ally friendly
jamming with MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output)
devices and how to maintain wireless communication under
both ally and adversarial jamming will be addressed in our
future work.
Threat Model: We consider unauthorized devices as
potential adversaries. The objective of unauthorized devices
is to defeat the proposed scheme so that they can com-
municate under ally friendly jamming. They may analyze
the ally friendly jamming signals and attempt to use the
result of analysis to remove the jamming signals with signal
processing techniques (e.g., [8], [9]). They may also em-
ploy anti-jamming communication techniques such as Direct
Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), Frequency Hopping
Spread Spectrum (FHSS), and their variations (e.g., [20],
[32], [39]).

where μ is the sampling offset due to mis-sampling.
In summary, the wireless channel and the hardware differ-
ences introduce various distortion to the signal transmission.
To correctly recover the transmitted messages, the receiver
need to either estimate these parameters to certain accuracy
or tolerate their inﬂuences.
III. ASSUMPTION AND THREAT MODEL
Assumptions: We assume that there are multiple ally
jammers and multiple authorized wireless devices, all of
which share a secret key set that is unknown to unauthorized
devices. We assume a high signal-to-noise radio (SNR) for
both transmission signals and ally jamming signals at the
receiver. We also assume that the clocks at ally jammers
In ally friendly jamming, upon detecting a transmission,
the authorized device can employ proper signal processing
techniques to remove the jamming signals from the received,
mixed signals. In contrast, the unauthorized device does not
have the secret keys, and cannot remove the interference
introduced by ally jamming signals.
Figure 2 further illustrates ally friendly jamming, where
one ally jammer is presented for simplicity. Assuming the
ally jammer, the authorized and unauthorized devices are all
in the same area. As mentioned earlier, the ally jammer and
authorized devices, including A1, A2, and AJ in Figure 2,
share a secret key k. The ally jammer AJ uses a Pseudo-
Random Number Generator (PRNG) with k as the seed to
continuously emit jamming signals XJ.

Illustration of ally friendly jamming.
When the unauthorized device E1 transmits signals XE1
to another unauthorized device E3, the signals received by
E3 will be the mixture of both XE1 and some portion of XJ.
With enough jamming power, the jamming signals from AJ
can effectively distort the signals XE1 at E3. As a result,
the wireless communication between unauthorized devices
E1 and E3 is disabled.
When A1 transmits signals XA1 to A2,
the jamming
signals XJ will also distort the received signals at A2.
However, since A2 shares the same secret key k with AJ,
it can regenerate the same jamming signals XJ using k. If
it can ﬁnd out which portion of XJ is mixed with XA1, it
can subtract this portion of XJ to get a clean copy of XA1.
To remove XJ from the mixed signals, authorized devices
need to synchronize with the ally jamming signals, estimate
their values in the mixed signals, and remove them from the
received, mixed signals to recover meaningful transmissions.
In the following sections, we will present how the ally
jammer generates ally jamming signals and how the autho-
rized device synchronizes with ally jammers and recovers
the transmissions.
A. Generation of Ally Jamming Signals
Every ally jammer uses a shared, unique secret key to
generate its ally jamming signals. Ally jammers and autho-
rized devices share a set of secret keys. Either group key
agreement (e.g., [17], [22], [43]) or group key distribution
protocols (e.g., [7], [23], [30]) can be used to generate
the secret key set. Assuming there are n ally jammers in
the network, identiﬁed as AJ1, AJ2, . . . , AJn and n keys
k1, k2, . . . , kn in the key set, the key kg will be assigned to
the ally jammer AJg.
To ensure effective jamming against unauthorized devices,
the jamming signals injected by ally jammers should resem-
ble random noises. To achieve this goal, we use a PRNG
to directly control the physical layer symbols so that these
signals appear to be random noises to unauthorized devices.
Since a physical layer symbol is represented as a complex
number, we can use a PRNG to generate random ﬂoating
point numbers with certain precision as the real and the
imaginary parts of each symbol.
Moreover, the injected jamming signals should allow the
authorized devices, which have access to the secret keys, to
synchronize with ally jammers, even they join the network
in the middle of a jamming session and the jamming has
been going on for a long period of time.

To accomplish these goals, we make the following design,
illustrated in Figure 3. We divide the time into equal-sized
epochs, each of which consists of n physical layer symbols.
Assuming that the duration of each physical layer symbol
is Ts. Then the duration of each epoch is Te = n · Ts. For
simplicity, we consider the time period [i· Te, (i + 1)· Te) as
the i-th epoch, where i is the epoch index. For convenience,
we also index and label the physical layer symbols within
each epoch. For example, in Figure 3, the symbols in the i-th
epoch are indexed from 0 to n−1 and labeled as ri,0 through
ri,n−1. With this design, for any given time t, we can easily
