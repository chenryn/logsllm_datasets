User:  What is failover? Please list several common failover scenarios.
Assistant: Failover is a technique for switching operations or services to a backup system or node in the event of a hardware or software failure. Its purpose is to ensure business continuity and high availability. Here are a few common failover scenarios: 1. Hot Standby: The system is running all the time, with the backup system following behind it and ready to transfer work over. 2. Cold backup: The backup system is shut down, it will only start up and become the primary system when the primary system fails. 3. Active-standby system: The main system and the backup system work together. When the main system fails, the backup system takes over. 4. Hot Standby Docking: Use a backup device to connect legacy hardware to a backup system for quick restoration of service. 5. Data replication: Through data replication technologies, such as mirroring, backup, snapshot, etc., the data is synchronized between the primary system and the backup system in real time to achieve the ability to quickly restore services.
