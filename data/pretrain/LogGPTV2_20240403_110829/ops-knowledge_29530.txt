Question: In reviewing the architecture of a web service that processes XML data, an analyst identifies the use of DTDs for XML documents. The service currently has no restrictions on entity expansion leading to potential denial-of-service risks. Which counterargument is most valid against the proposal to only increase server capacity as a mitigation strategy?
"A": "Increasing server capacity does not address the root cause of the vulnerability and can still be overwhelmed by recursive entity expansion.",
"B": "The proposal will reduce the overall performance of the web service by increasing the load on the server.",
"C": "DTDs are outdated and should be replaced with JSON, which does not have the same vulnerability.",
"D": "Recursive entity expansion cannot be triggered intentionally and only occurs due to malformed XML documents."
Answer: A
