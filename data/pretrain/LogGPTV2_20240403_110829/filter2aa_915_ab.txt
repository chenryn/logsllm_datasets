The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA), 18 
U.S.C. §§ 1831-39 
Broad and applies to more than just intentional theft. 
Can be a significant hazard for companies that legitimately 
receive the confidential information of another company. 
Some lawful methods for gathering business intelligence or 
―research and development leads‖ may in fact constitute acts 
of trade secret misappropriation.  
Trade secret can be virtually any type of information, 
including combinations of public information.

Economic Espionage Act extends protection against

Intelligence/Situational Awareness 
Whether the information was a trade secret is the 
crucial element that separates lawful from unlawful 
conduct.  Possession of open-source or readily 
ascertainable information for the benefit of a foreign 
government is clearly not espionage.  The essence of 
economic espionage is the misappropriation of trade 
secret information for the benefit of a foreign 
government.

Firms routinely gather publicly available or ―open-
source‖ information about rivals a lawful practice known 
as competitive intelligence. 
Competitive intelligence is the ethic and lawful 
application of industry and research expertise to analyze 
publicly available information on rivals and to produce 
actionable intelligence that supports informed and 
strategic business decisions.

Defendant was convicted of stealing and transferring

argued, was never intended to be placed in interstate or 
foreign commerce.

did not violate EEA.
