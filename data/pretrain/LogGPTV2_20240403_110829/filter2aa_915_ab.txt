### Intelligence and Situational Awareness

#### The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA)
The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (EEA), codified at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1831-39, is a broad statute that extends beyond intentional theft. It can pose significant risks for companies that legitimately receive another company's confidential information. Some lawful methods for gathering business intelligence or "research and development leads" may inadvertently constitute trade secret misappropriation.

- **Trade Secrets**: Trade secrets can encompass virtually any type of information, including combinations of public information.
- **Legal Reference**: Douglas Nemec and Kristen Voorhees, "Recent amendment to the Economic Espionage Act extends protection against misappropriation," available at [Thomson Reuters](http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/Insight/2013/02_-_February/Recent_amendment_to_the_Economic_Espionage_Act_ex).

#### Distinguishing Lawful from Unlawful Conduct
The critical factor in determining whether conduct is lawful or unlawful is whether the information in question qualifies as a trade secret. Possession of open-source or readily ascertainable information for the benefit of a foreign government does not constitute espionage. Economic espionage involves the misappropriation of trade secret information for the benefit of a foreign government.

- **Legal Reference**: United States v. Chung, 633 F.Supp. 2d. 1134 (C.D. Cal. July 16, 2009).

#### Competitive Intelligence
Firms often gather publicly available or "open-source" information about rivals, a practice known as competitive intelligence. This is an ethical and lawful method that involves analyzing publicly available information to support informed and strategic business decisions.

- **Desired Information**:
  - Research Plans
  - R&D Data
  - Product Design
  - Marketing Strategies
  - Cost Structures & Pricing Strategies
- **Common Methods**:
  - Data mining
  - Patent tracking
  - Psychological modeling of rival executives
  - Trade shows
  - Monitoring mass media
  - Conversations with a rival’s customers, partners, and employees

#### Ethical Considerations in Competitive Intelligence
Competitive intelligence should not involve the misappropriation of proprietary information or trade secrets. It focuses on open-source public information such as shareholder reports, advertising, sales literature, press releases, news stories, and published interviews.

- **Ethically Questionable Practices**:
  - Appropriating documents misplaced by rivals (e.g., iPhone incident)
  - Overhearing rival executives discussing strategy
  - Hiring employees away from rivals
  - Dumpster diving in rival’s trash receptacles
- **Legal Reference**: Chris Carr & Larry Gorman, "The Revictimization of Companies by the Stock Market who Report Trade Secret Theft Under the Economic Espionage Act," 57 Bus. Law 25 (2001); Victoria Sind-Flor, "Industry Spying Still Flourishes," Nat’l L., Mar. 29, 2000.

#### Methods of Economic Espionage
Economic espionage involves various illegal activities, including:

- Electronic eavesdropping
- Surveillance of rival executives and scientists
- Social engineering
- Bribing employees or vendors
- Planting "moles" in rival firms
- Hacking and stealing computers
- Cybertheft of data
- Outright stealing trade secrets in documentary, electronic, and other formats

#### Case Study: United States v. Aleynikov
- **Case Details**:
  - **Defendant**: Sergey Aleynikov, a former computer programmer and vice president at Goldman Sachs.
  - **Role**: Developed computer programs for the bank’s high-frequency trading (HFT) system.
  - **Incident**: On his last day, Aleynikov encrypted and uploaded 500,000 lines of source code to a server in Germany, then deleted the encryption program and history of his commands.
  - **Conviction**: Initially convicted under the National Stolen Property Act (NSPA) and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA).
  - **Appeal**: Aleynikov argued that the EEA only applies to trade secrets related to tangible products sold, licensed, or distributed. The Court of Appeals held that the source code did not constitute stolen "goods," "wares," or "merchandise" under the NSPA and that the theft did not violate the EEA.
- **Legal Reference**: United States v. Aleynikov, 676 F.3d. 71 (2d Cir (SDNY) Apr. 11, 2012).

#### IA Policies and Training
- **Training**:
  - Banners
  - User Agreements
  - Annual, semi-annual, or quarterly training
  - Enforcement and employee discipline for violations
- **Information Control**:
  - Access lists
  - Encryption
  - Digital Rights Management (DRM)
  - Electronic Mail Control
- **Active Defense**:
  - Deception
  - Active defense measures

#### SEC Regulations and Active Defense
- **Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure)**: Requires companies to distribute material information in a manner reasonably designed to reach the general public broadly and non-exclusively.
- **Legal Reference**: Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, Release No. 69279/April 2, 2013, Report of investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: Netflix, Inc., and Reed Hastings, available at [SEC.gov](http://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-69279.pdf).

#### Active Defense and Recovery Operations
- **Recovery Operations**:
  - Example: Clark's Law
  - FTP Server Intrusion
  - Issues with logs and third-party involvement
- **Stop the Pain**:
  - Good CNE (Computer Network Exploitation)
  - Command and Control (C2) Server
  - Victim and intruder interactions
  - Legal considerations and potential lawsuits

#### Hack Back
- **Legal Reference**: United States v. John Doe, et al., No. 3:11 CV 561 (VLB), Dt. Conn, June 16, 2011.
- **Case Details**:
  - TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) granted to stop the Coreflood botnet.
  - Five C&C servers seized and 29 domain names used for communication.
  - Government authorized to respond to infected computers with a command to temporarily stop the malware.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the legal and ethical considerations in intelligence and situational awareness, with a focus on competitive intelligence, economic espionage, and active defense measures.
