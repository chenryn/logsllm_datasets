User: In linux, how can I determine the default text editor, terminal, etc?
does it vary by distro?
Assistant: Per-user environment variables tells you that.

$EDITOR gives you the command to be launched as text editor;
$BROWSER gives you the browser
$PAGER gives you the pager (ex. more or less).

This however is valid for command line softwares, while usually desktop environments use their own (internal) variables.
Also in python you can read the environment variables using os.getenv.
