User: Please list some common types of cyber attacks, and briefly explain their principles and countermeasures.
Assistant: 1. DDos attack: Distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is an attack method whose purpose is to send complex network requests to a target system in parallel by using a "botnet" composed of multiple computers to paralyze the system or Unable to respond. Solution: Use firewall technology and traffic monitoring to detect and isolate attack traffic. 2. SQL injection attack: SQL injection attack is a network attack method that uses vulnerabilities to send malicious input to web applications. Attackers can access the database in this way and leak sensitive data. Solution: Use input validation, data filtering, and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. 3. Botnet attack: Botnet attack is an attack method that uses a "botnet" composed of multiple infected computers to perform genetic attack tasks. This attack method is used to conduct DDoS attacks or steal sensitive information. Workaround: Use an antimalware program to detect and remove botware, and use firewall technology to isolate bot computers. 4. Honeypot attack: Honeypot attack refers to creating a virtual system "used to lure hackers to attack" in order to collect attack information and characteristics. Countermeasure: Configure honeypots in the network and place them in unconventional locations to capture attack behavior and characteristics. 5. Decoy attack: Decoy attack refers to the attack completed by using human psychology or the process of communicating with people. This type of attack is common in social engineering attacks. Solution: Carry out network security education and training to enhance users' awareness of network security.
