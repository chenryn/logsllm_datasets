**Figure 10: Occurrence Counts Using a 30 Coefficient Representation with DF +S:Fourier+Spike Over a 20-Week Period**

This figure provides a breakdown of the occurrence counts for different types of ports and highlights the components that are frequently selected in the compressed representation. Across all port categories, the dictionary components that are consistently chosen correspond to periodic elements such as diurnal and off-diurnal frequencies.

The stability of a component is not only determined by its selection in the compressed representation but also by the amplitude of the component. Therefore, we analyze the amplitudes of the frequently occurring components (those present more than 50% of the time) over the 20-week dataset. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate the mean and deviation of the amplitudes returned by the greedy pursuit procedure for these components. For clarity, the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier (periodic) components are shown separately.

For each port, the components are sorted based on their average magnitude (i.e., the energy represented by both the real and imaginary parts combined) over the 20-week period. The average amplitudes and deviations are normalized by the magnitude of the mean (or zero-th Fourier) component. Our observations indicate that the amplitudes are fairly stable for many Fourier components across different port types. These results suggest that these stable Fourier frequencies may form fundamental components of the traffic time series. The relative stability of the amplitudes in the compressed representation also suggests the feasibility of building traffic models that capture the essential variations in traffic using the compressed representations.

### 6.3.3 Spatial Analysis Across Traffic Metrics

The final part of our analysis examines the similarity in traffic data across different aggregates for a given port within each week. We expect a strong correlation between the number of flows, packets, and bytes for the same port, as well as a reasonable correlation between the total incoming and outgoing traffic volumes. Figure 13 confirms this intuition. For high volume and P2P application ports, more than two-thirds of the dictionary components are commonly selected across all traffic aggregates, and more than 30 components are selected across at least four of the traffic aggregates (bytes, packets, flows both to and from the port). This similarity is less pronounced for scan target ports and random ports. Our hypothesis is that the distribution of packets per flow and bytes per packet is more regular for high volume applications (e.g., most HTTP and P2P packets use the maximum packet size for maximum throughput) compared to lesser-known ports, which may be primarily used for small-sized requests.

### 7 Applications

#### 7.1 Visualization

One of the primary objectives of compression is to provide network operators with a high-fidelity approximation that captures the key features of the original traffic metric. Visualizing historical traffic patterns is crucial for anomaly detection and diagnosis, as it allows network operators to use historical data as visual aids. It is essential to capture both periodic trends and isolated incidents of interest (e.g., a post-lunch peak in Port 80 traffic, occasional spikes in file-sharing applications).

**Figure 14** shows canonical examples from each of the four port categories. Each example includes the original traffic time series over a week, the reconstructed time series from the compressed representation using 1:6 compression with DF +H+S (Fourier + Haar + Spike), and the residual signal (the point-wise difference between the original and compressed signals). The traffic values are normalized with respect to the maximum traffic observed for the week. The compressed representations provide a high-fidelity visualization of the original traffic data. Ports with highly regular traffic are the most compressible, and the difference between the actual and compressed representations is negligible in these cases. The compressed representation captures both the periodic components and traffic spikes and other variations.

#### 7.2 Traffic Trend Analysis

Analyzing traffic trends is a routine aspect of network operations. Operators need to understand changes and trends in the application mix flowing through the network (e.g., detecting a new popular file-sharing protocol). Understanding traffic trends is also crucial for traffic engineering, provisioning, and accounting. It is desirable that trend analysis performed on compressed data yields accurate results compared to similar analysis on raw (uncompressed) data. A simple method to extract long-term trends is to take the weekly average and find a linear fit using simple linear regression. **Figure 15** plots the relative error in estimating such a linear trend using 20 weeks of data for different ports.
