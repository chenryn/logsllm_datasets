**Issue: Unable to Log In to Server 2008 R2 with a Delegated Control User Account**

I am unable to log in to a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine using an account that has been granted delegated control for creating, deleting, and managing user accounts. When I attempt to log in, I receive the following error message:

> "You cannot log on because the logon method you are using is not allowed on this computer. Please see your network administrator for more information."

**Details:**
- **Domain:** test.com
- **User Account:** Has delegated control (create, delete, manage user accounts)

**Request:**
Please provide assistance to resolve this issue.

**Solution:**

1. **Using MMC for Delegated Tasks:**
   - You can use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to perform the tasks of creating, deleting, and managing user accounts. This approach does not require the user to log in directly to the server.

2. **Granting Logon Permissions:**
   - If you need the user account to be able to log in to the server, you should add the account to the **Domain Admins** group. This will grant the necessary permissions for logging in and performing administrative tasks.
   
   - **Steps to Add the User to Domain Admins:**
     1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers** (ADUC).
     2. Navigate to the **Users** container or the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU) where the user account is located.
     3. Right-click the user account and select **Properties**.
     4. Go to the **Member Of** tab.
     5. Click **Add** and type **Domain Admins**.
     6. Click **OK** to apply the changes.

By adding the user to the Domain Admins group, you should be able to log in to the server without encountering the logon method restriction.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.
