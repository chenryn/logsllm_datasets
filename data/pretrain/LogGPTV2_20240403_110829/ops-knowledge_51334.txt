User: I have both Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on my Windows Machine. When I type Python in CMD it defaults to Python2.7.  How do I switch to 3.4?
Assistant: Simply changing the name of the python.exe to anything (ex:pytoioion.exe) in your C:/Python34 or C:/Python27 will switch between the two versions. To verify, run this on your command prompt
