User: How to optimize the performance of database query statements?
Assistant: 1. Using indexes in queries can greatly improve query speed. Indexes can help the database quickly locate the data that needs to be queried, avoiding full table scans. 2. Avoid using LIKE and wildcard queries, because a full table scan is required for matching, which will reduce query performance. 3. Use subqueries and joint queries as little as possible, because these queries will increase the burden on the database and affect query performance. 4. Optimize the table structure, improve the efficiency of database operation by summarizing and decomposing tables, rationally designing data types, and standardizing the database structure. 5. Control the size of the query data and try to avoid querying a large amount of data at one time. You can paginate queries by using LIMIT and OFFSET, and use the WHERE clause to filter out unwanted data. 6. Deploy databases and applications to different servers to reduce system load and improve query performance. 7. According to business needs, optimize important query statements, view the execution plan of query statements through tools such as EXPLAIN and ANALYZE, and optimize according to the execution plan.
