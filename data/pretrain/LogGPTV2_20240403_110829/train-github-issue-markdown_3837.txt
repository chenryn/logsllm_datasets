# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
Users often require an administrator command prompt to perform certain tasks. However, the current terminal design does not support this functionality. The proposed enhancement would enable users to open an administrator tab within the existing terminal window, thereby allowing them to manage multiple command-line tools in a single, unified interface.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
The proposed feature aims to provide users with easy access to a superuser command prompt, such as CMD, PowerShell, or WSL shell. This can be achieved through the following methods:

1. **Right-Click on Current Tab:**
   - Add a context menu option to the current tab that allows users to open an administrator session in a new tab.

2. **Dropdown List Option:**
   - Include an option in the dropdown list that, when right-clicked, enables the user to launch the selected prompt in administrator mode.

3. **Icon for Administrator Mode:**
   - Place an icon next to each item in the dropdown list, which, when clicked, opens the corresponding command-line tool in administrator mode.

By integrating these options, users will be able to keep all their command-line tools and sessions within the same terminal window, enhancing usability and efficiency.
