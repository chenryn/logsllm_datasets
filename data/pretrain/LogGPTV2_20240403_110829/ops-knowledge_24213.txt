User: I generally use Python 2.7 but recently installed Python 3.5 using Miniconda on Mac OS X. Different libraries have been installed for these two versions of python. Now, the entering either of the keywords 'python' or 'python3' in terminal invokes python 3.5, and 'python2' returns '-bash: python2: command not found'. How can I now invoke them specifically using aliases 'python2' and 'python3' respectively?
I am currently using OS X El Capitan.
Assistant: Similar to John Wilkey's answer I would run python2 by finding which python, something like using /usr/bin/python and then creating an alias in .bash_profile:
alias python2="/usr/bin/python"
I can now run python3 by calling python and python2 by calling python2.
