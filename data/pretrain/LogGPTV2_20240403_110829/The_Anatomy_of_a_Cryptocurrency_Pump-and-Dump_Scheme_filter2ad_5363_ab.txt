the buy sides indicates a higher trading aggressiveness on
the buy side.8 This further suggests that many investors may
be “stuck” with BVB which they are unwilling to liquidate at
the low market price after the pump-and-dump. Those coin
holders can only expect to reverse the position in the next
pump, which might never come.
Low participation ratio: It is worth noting that the total
count of trading transactions associated with this pump-and-
dump is merely 322. That number appears very low compared
to the 1,376 views of the coin announcement message, let
alone the over 10,000 channel members. This indicates that
the majority of group members are either observers, who want
no skin in the game, or have become aware of the difﬁculty
in securing proﬁt from a pump-and-dump.
4 Analyzing Pump-and-Dump Schemes
In this section we explain how we obtain data from both Tele-
gram and the various exchanges, which allows us to analyze
and model pump-and-dump schemes.
4.1 Collecting Pump-and-Dump Events
In this study, we examine routinely organized pump-and-
dump events that follow the pattern of “set-up → pre-pump
announcement → pump → dump → post-pump review” as
described in Section 2. This type of pump-and-dump involves
live instructions from organizers (see Figure 1 and Figure 3),
so encrypted chat applications such as Telegram and Discord
are ideal for broadcasting those events.
We are conﬁdent that it sufﬁces to focus solely on pump-
and-dump events orchestrated on Telegram as every active
pump-and-dump group we found on Discord was also on
Telegram.9 Telegram is among the primary media for pump-
and-dump activities and announcements, and it would be both
unreasonable and unlikely for any pump-and-dump organizer
8Note that Cryptopia is a peer-to-peer trading platform which lets users
trade directly with each other; the exchange takes no risk position and only
proﬁts from charging trading fees. Therefore, buying volume implies that
the trade is initiated by the buyer, which typically drives the market price up;
similarly, sale volume is initiated by the sell side and would drive the price
down.
9This observation has also been conﬁrmed by the PumpOlymp team, an
online information provider specialized in cryptocurrency pump-and-dump.

pump-and-dump. The ﬁgure shows a timeline from 48 hours before up to 1
hour after the pump-and-dump. For the illustration purposes, the timeline is
scaled with non-linear transformation to better display the development of
volume gaps during the pump-and-dump.
seconds of a manic buying wave, the coin price already sky-
rocketed to its peak. Note that Bomba bitcoin “cryptopia”
only announced the coin at the time when the coin price was
already at its peak, making it impossible for investors who
solely relied on the announcement from the channel to make
any money.
Not being able to remain at this high level for more than
a few seconds, the coin price began to decrease, with some
resistance in between, and then plummeted. Three and half
minutes after the start of the pump-and-dump, the coin price
had dropped below its open price. Afterwards, transactions
only occurred sporadically.
Volume: Figure 5 shows that the pump-and-dump induces
fake demand and inﬂates buy volume. While every pump-and-
dump participant would hope for a quick windfall gain during
a minute-long pump, the majority would not manage to act
fast enough to sell at a high price. Those investors would
either end up selling coins at a loss, or, if reluctant to sell low,
would hold the virtually worthless coins. This is demonstrated
by Figure 5, which shows that the buy volume exceeds the
sell volume, whether measured by the target coin BVB or by
BTC. The ﬁgure also shows small volume movements shortly
before the pump-and-dump, also observable in Figure 4(a),
which can be indicative of organizers’ pre-purchase conduct.
As the BVB blockchain is not being actively maintained and
the coin itself is extremely illiquid, any market movement
may be deemed unusual.
Figure 5 illustrates that the total buy volume (also including
the pre-purchased volume, though negligible) in BTC asso-
ciated with the pump-and-dump amounts to 1.06 BTC, the
sell volume only 0.58 BTC; the total buy volume measured
in BVB is 1,619.81 thousand BVB, the sell amount 1,223.36
thousand BVB. This volume discrepancy between the sell and

success of a pump-and-dump is the number of participants.
Telegram channels: Our primary source on pump-and-dump
Telegram channels and events is provided by PumpOlymp,10
a website that hosts a comprehensive directory of hundreds
of pump-and-dump channels.
PumpOlymp discovers those channels by searching pump-
related keywords — e.g. “pump”, “whales”, “vip” and
“coin” — on Telegram aggregators such as https://tgstat.
com/ and https://telegramcryptogroups.com/. An-
other source for new pump-and-dump channels is cross-
promotion on the known channels.11 To validate the incoming
data from PumpOlymp, we conduct an independent manual
search for pump-and-dump channels. We are not able to add
new channels to the existing channel list from PumpOlymp,
and we are not aware of any other, more comprehensive pump-
and-dump channel list. Therefore, we believe the channel list
from PumpOlymp is a good starting point.
Next, we use the ofﬁcial Telegram API to retrieve mes-
sage history from those channels, in total 358, to check their
status and activity. Among those channels, 43 have been
deleted from the Telegram sever, possibly due to inactivity
for an extended period of time. Among the existing ones,
over half (168/315) have not been active for a month, pos-
sibly because cautious admins delete pump-and-dump mes-
sages to eviscerate their traces. This might also imply that
the Telegram channels have a “hit-and-run” characteristic. As
described in the section above, one learns from participation
in pump-and-dump activities that quick bucks are not easy
to make. Therefore, curious newcomers might be fooled by
pump-and-dump organizers’ advertising and lured into the ac-
tivity. After losing money a few times, participants may lose
faith and interest, and cease partaking. This forms a vicious
circle, since with fewer participants, it would be more difﬁcult
to pump a coin. Therefore, channel admins might desert their
channel when the performance declines, and start new ones
to attract the inexperienced.
Pump-and-dump history: Starting June 2018, PumpOlymp
has been gleaning pump-and-dump events organized on Tele-
gram. Using their API,12 we acquire an initial list of historical
pump-and-dump activities over the period of June 17, 2018
and February 26, 2019. For each listed pump-and-dump event,
the data set contains the pumped coin, the target exchange, the
organizing Telegram channel, the coin announcement time,
plus the price and volume data on the tick-by-tick level from
coin announcement up to 15 minutes afterwards.
We run plausibility checks to validate each record’s qual-
iﬁcation as a pump-and-dump. For example, if an alleged
pump-and-dump is recorded to have started at a time that is

far from a full hour (6:00, 7:00, etc.) or a half hour, then we
would be suspicious, because an organizer would normally
not choose a random time for a pump-and-dump. If there is no
signiﬁcant increase in volume or high price around the pump
time, we would also be skeptical. In such a circumstance, we
manually check the message history to make a ﬁnal judgment.
In most cases, the message either discusses the potential of
a coin or the record is simply a mistake. Note that we ex-
clusively consider message series with count-downs (e.g. “3
hours left”, “5 mins left”) and coin announcement; messages
on pump signal detection are eliminated from our sample.
In the end, we trace 429 pump-and-dump coin announce-
ments from June 17, 2018 to February 26, 2019, each of which
is characterized by a series of messages similar to those pre-
sented in Figure 1. One pump-and-dump can be co-organized
by multiple channels; if two coin announcements were broad-
cast within 3 minutes apart from each other and they target
the same coin at the same exchange, then we consider them
to be one pump-and-dump event. In total, we collected 412
unique pump-and-dump events.
Excluded data points: All the pumped coins in our sample
were paired with BTC. We also observed and manually col-
lected a few ETH-paired pumps, most of which took place
in other exchanges.13 Inclusion of those cases would require
data collection with other methods and resources. Due to their
rarity, we do not consider ETH-paired pump-and-dumps in
our study.
4.2 Obtaining Coin Data
Apart from consulting the online pump-and-dump informa-
tion center PumpOlymp, we retrieve additional information
on features and price movements of coins from other sources,
13For example, PLX on October 10, 2018 in CoinExchange, ETC on
April 22, 2018 in Bibox.

pump.
(a) Pump and dump activities from June 2018 to February 2019
in order to establish a connection between the information
and the pump-and-dump pattern.
Speciﬁcally, we use the public API from CryptoCompare14
for coins’ hourly OHLC (open, high, low, close) and volume
data on 189 exchanges, including Binance, Bittrex, Cryptopia
and Yobit. The API provides live data, which means users are
able to obtain price information up to the time point of data
retrieval. While historical minute-level data are also available
on CryptoCompare, they are restricted to a 7-day time window
and thus not utilized.
In the conventional stock market, pump-and-dump opera-
tors favor microcap stocks due to high manipulability of their
price [3]; we expect to observe a similar phenomenon in the
crypto-market. To collect coins’ market cap data, we use the
public API from CoinMarketCap. Because we are interested
in coins’ “true” market cap that is uninﬂuenced by any maneu-
ver, we purposefully chose to retrieve the data at 08:42 GMT,
November 5. We believe the market cap data retrieved are not
contaminated by Telegram organized pump-and-dumps, since
they typically start on the hour or the half hour and last only
a few minutes.
In addition to market trading data, we also retrieve coins’
non-ﬁnancial features. Speciﬁcally, we use exchanges’ public
API15 to collect information on coins’ listing status, algorithm,
and total supply. We also collect coins’ launch dates using
CryptoCompare’s public API. For information that is not
contained in the API but viewable online (such as coins’ rating
data on Cryptocurrency), we use either page source scraping
or screen scraping, depending on the design of the desired
webpage. All our data on coin features are from publicly
accessible sources.

4.3 Role of Exchanges
Pump-and-dump schemes take place within the walled gar-
dens of crypto-exchanges. Binance, Bittrex, Cryptopia, and
Yobit are among the most popular exchanges used by pumpers
(see Figure 6). While those exchanges differ vastly in terms
of their volume, markets, and user base, each of them has its
own appeal to pumpers. Large exchanges such as Binance
and Bittrex have a large user base, and abnormal price hype
caused by pump activities can quickly attract a large number
of other users to the exchange. Smaller exchanges such as
Cryptopia and Yobit tend to host esoteric coins with low liq-
uidity, whose price can be more easily manipulated compared
to mainstream coins such as Ether (ETH) or Litecoin (LTC).
In general, larger exchanges are more reliable than smaller
ones. While both Binance and Cryptopia were hacked re-
cently,16 the former managed to remain operative, while the

latter halted trading and fell into liquidation.
Activity distribution by exchange: Among the 412 pump-
and-dump activities, 68 (17%) took place in Binance, 21 (5%)
in Bittrex, 211 (51%) in Cryptopia and 112 (27%) in Yobit. In
aggregate, 35% (146/412) of the time, the selected coin had
previously been pumped in the same exchange (see Figure 7).
Figure 8 compares the aggregate three-hour trading volume
in BTC of pumped coins before and during a pump-and-dump,
and the artiﬁcial trading volume generated by those pump-
and-dump activities is astonishing: 8,793 BTC (93% from
Binance), roughly equivalent to 50 million USD,17 of trading
volume during the pump hours, 9 times as much as the pre-
pump volume (943 BTC), and that only over a period of eight
months.
Figure 9 illustrates the occurrence and the effectiveness of
individual pump-and-dump activities. In terms of frequency,
Bittrex is most rarely chosen; Binance started to gain traction
only since September, but still witnesses far less pump-and-
dump occurrence than Yobit and Cryptopia. Turning to Yobit
with Cryptopia, we ﬁnd that the two exchanges have comple-
mented each other: when Yobit was inactive (most notably
October 2018 to January 2019), Cryptopia experienced more
trafﬁc; when Cryptopia went silent (since the hack in mid-
January 2019), Yobit regained popularity. In terms of percent-
age of coin price increase, pumps in both Yobit and Cryptopia
appear to be more powerful than those in Bittrex and Binance.
What goes hand-in-hand with price surge is price dip: coin
prices also drop more dramatically during the dump in Yobit
and Cryptopia compared to their peer exchanges.
Proﬁt for admins: Even with tick-by-tick data for each
pumped coin during their respective pump-and-dump period,
due to lack of trader ID we cannot precisely match individu-
als’ buy and sell transactions. Therefore, to estimate proﬁt for
admins, we need to make a few assumptions:
1. Admins purchase coins and enter sell orders only prior
to the pump.
and https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_
id=3&objectid=12231209.
17This is calculated based on the unit BTC price of 5,715 USD, which is
the mean of the high price of 8,250 USD and the low price 3,180 USD during
the data period.
Figure 10: Views of coin announcement message versus coin price increase
during the pump. The ﬁgure illustrates the relationships between coin price
increase through pump, views of coin announcement message, pump volume,
and pump exchange.
2. Admins purchase coins at the price immediately before
the pump begins.
3. During the pump period — before the price reaches the
peak, investors lift the admin’s offers and push the price
higher; during the dump period — when the price drops,
investors transact with each other.
With those assumptions, we arrive at the estimation as pre-
