User: How to build and configure Docker containers and deploy applications on Linux servers?
Assistant: The following are the steps to build and configure Docker containers and deploy applications on a Linux server: 1. Install Docker To install Docker on a Linux server, you can use the following command: $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce 2 . Configure Docker After installing Docker, you need to configure it. You can modify the /etc/docker/daemon.json file to configure Docker parameters, such as modifying the default port number. 3. To pull the application image, you need to pull the required application image through Docker Hub or other image warehouses. For example, the following command can be used to pull the Nginx image: $ docker pull nginx 4. Run the container Use the docker run command to run the image and create a container. For example, the following command can be used to run the Nginx container: $ docker run -d --name mynginx -p 80:80 nginx The above command will run the Nginx container in the background and map its port 80 to the host's port 80, allowing users to Access the Nginx service in the container through the host's IP address. 5. Deploy the application Deploy the application in the container, you can place the application file in the container, or use the Dockerfile to build a new image. For example, a Docker image with a Node.js application can be built using the following Dockerfile: FROM node:alpine WORKDIR /usr/src/app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 3000 CMD [ "npm", "start" ] 6. Save the image Before deploying the application, you need to save the container state as a new image through the docker commit command. For example, you can use the following command to save the modified Node.js image: $ docker commit mynode mynode-with-app The above command will save the current container state as a new image for later use. 7. Deploy the application Finally, you can use the method described in step 4 to deploy the new application image and run a new container. To sum up, the above are the steps to build and configure Docker containers and deploy applications on Linux servers.
