### Title: Is This My Domain Controller? A New Class of Active Directory Protocol Injection Attacks

#### Abstract:
When evaluating the security of cryptographic systems, a critical aspect is their resilience against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Over the years, researchers have successfully exploited many secure protocols using MitM attacks. A common theme in these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper validation for any of the communicating parties.

In Active Directory environments, the most common authentication protocols are Kerberos and NTLM. This presentation will review previous MitM attacks on Active Directory authentication protocols and the mitigation strategies that have been implemented. We will demonstrate that relay attack techniques, which were previously thought to be limited to NTLM, can also be used to target the newer Kerberos authentication protocol. Additionally, we will present several injection attacks that compromise client systems.

We will illustrate how the absence of proper validation can lead to severe issues, ranging from authentication bypass to remote code execution on various critical infrastructure systems. These vulnerabilities extend beyond Windows on-premises networks to other infrastructures, such as domain-joined Unix machines, virtualization infrastructures, and even cloud directories like Azure AD.

The talk will provide a technical deep dive into multiple vulnerabilities we have discovered, accompanied by several demonstrations. These demos will include a MitM attack that allows an attacker to inject user passwords in a hybrid AD environment, enabling them to authenticate as any user in the network. We will also show how a similar technique can be used to take over an organization's virtualization infrastructure.

By the end of this session, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the current threats to Active Directory and the steps they can take to mitigate these risks.
