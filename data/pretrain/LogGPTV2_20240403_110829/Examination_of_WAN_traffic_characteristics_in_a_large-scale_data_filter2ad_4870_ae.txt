### Traffic Data Analysis and Prediction for Service-Level WAN Traffic Engineering

#### Traffic Data Collection and Analysis
Traffic data was collected over a one-week period. Figure 13 presents the normalized traffic volume for each type of service during the first four days of the week, on a 1-minute time scale. The diurnal patterns observed among services vary significantly. The coefficient of variation for these time series ranges from 0.13 (Database) to 0.62 (Cloud), indicating a wide diversity in traffic variations across different services.

#### Challenges for SD-WAN Methods
The distinct temporal variations among different types of services pose significant challenges for existing Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) methods. These methods often rely on the average or median traffic volume in the last few minutes to estimate the demand for high-priority WAN traffic [14, 19]. A common approach to mitigate prediction errors is to set aside different headrooms [22, 32]. However, larger prediction errors require larger headrooms, which can reduce the utilization of WAN links and degrade performance for bulk transfers over WAN.

#### Traffic Demand Prediction Models
To address this challenge, we selected three widely-used time series models to evaluate their accuracy in predicting traffic demand: Historical Average, Historical Median, and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES). The Historical Average/Median models calculate the average/median of historical data as a prediction, while SES calculates the weighted average of historical data, with weights decreasing exponentially as observations become older. Specifically, the traffic demand at time \( t + 1 \) is estimated as:
\[
\hat{y}_{t+1|t} = \alpha y_t + (1 - \alpha) \hat{y}_{t|t-1}
\]
where \( \alpha \) (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) controls the rate at which the weights decrease. In our experiments, \( \alpha \) was set to 0.2 and 0.8.

#### Evaluation of Prediction Methods
We evaluated these estimation methods using high-priority WAN traffic data spanning one week, on a 1-minute time scale. We performed a 1-minute-ahead prediction using historical traffic data within a 5-minute window. For each type of service, the prediction was applied to inter-DC WAN links that carry large amounts of traffic for that service. The median prediction error on each link was computed as:
\[
\frac{|\hat{y}_{t+1} - y_{t+1}|}{y_{t+1}}
\]
Figure 14 shows the prediction errors for each type of service. The prediction accuracy varies significantly across services. While the models perform well for Web and Analytics services with prediction errors less than 5%, the error for services like Cloud and FileSystem reaches nearly 15% due to their short run-length of stability (see Figure 12(a)). Additionally, the Historical Average/Median models predict slightly less accurately than the SES models with \( \alpha \) close to 1, indicating that more distant observations have less effect on the prediction due to non-stationary patterns.

#### Implications for Traffic Engineering
These observations reaffirm our analysis of traffic stability and suggest that for some services, a large headroom is required if the above methods are applied, leading to less efficient use of WAN bandwidth. A possible way to improve prediction accuracy is to leverage neural network-based prediction models (e.g., LSTM), which can capture more features of time series. Such models may take longer to compute, but they are viable given that traffic engineering is often performed on time scales over 1 minute.

#### Summary and Implications
Our analysis reveals different interaction patterns among services. Web and Computing services heavily interact with each other, indicating a close relationship. Analytics, AI, Map, and Security services send their traffic more evenly, implying their prevalence. These observations provide insights into service migration and deployment, such as co-locating Web and Computing services in a few data centers and replicating Analytics, AI, Map, and Security services across all data centers. We also observe a high correlation between traffic time series on a 10-minute time scale across individual services, indicating a limited number of traffic variation patterns. This suggests that the traffic trend of a service can be estimated using the trends of other correlated services.

#### Related Work
Previous studies have characterized traffic within data center networks, including Microsoft (Web search) and Facebook (social network) data centers [4, 5, 11, 20, 27]. These works have implications for designing novel connection fabrics, traffic engineering protocols, and advanced switches in data centers. Some studies have also examined packet burst behavior, which is useful for device buffer configuration and efficient congestion control [21, 34]. Our work, however, focuses on WAN traffic, providing insights into WAN traffic engineering, service migration, and deployment, as well as WAN switch configuration.

#### Conclusion
This paper examines the WAN traffic characteristics in Baidu’s data center network. We find a significant fraction of traffic demands over DC-WAN, leading to higher utilization for links carrying WAN traffic and challenging WAN traffic engineering. While aggregated traffic and traffic exchanges among heavy DCs remain stable over time, the stability and traffic characteristics vary across different services on a 1-minute time scale, leading to different prediction accuracies for high-priority traffic. The large prediction error for some types of services using existing methods motivates further investigation of better prediction methods for fine-grained traffic engineering at the service level.
