security operations to focus a tremendous amount of time and energy on preventive controls to "keep
the threat out." Prevention is important; however, 100% prevention is not feasible. An organization
should understand potential impacts if a threat is successful.
Execution Phases
At a high level, a Red Team must move through these three phases to complete an engagement.
Get In - Gain access to a network. The Red Team must have access to their target. Access can be
through a legitimate compromise or access is directly granted as part of an assumed breach scenario,
such as an insider threat scenario.
Can an organization detect a threat gaining
access to its network?
Stay In - Establish persistence or a permanent presence. Red Team engagements are typically longer
than other types of tests. A Red Team usually establishes persistence or a permanent presence in order
to survive the duration of the engagement.
Can an organization detect or prevent a threat
from living in its network?
Act - Finally, a Red Team performs operational impacts against the target
What impacts can a threat perform based on
the capabilities it gained during Get In and
Stay In?
Phase Mapping
Most penetration testing frameworks are broken down into individual phases that focus on
vulnerability identification and exploitation. The Red Team methodology categorizes many of the
same actions into only three distinct phases with a focus on the impacts caused to the target
environment. Several examples of this categorization have been provided below.
GET IN
Reconnaissance
● Perform Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) against the target.
● Search using open, unauthenticated sources:
○ Target websites
○ Social media
○ Search engines
○ Public code repositories
○ Alternate target sites
External enumeration
● Identify external assets:
○ Perform a reverse DNS scan to identify registered hosts
○ Identify URLs and other external touch points from the scan and OSINT
● Evaluate the web presence:
○ Browse as a normal user through a web proxy to capture intelligence and
understanding
○ Identify known vulnerabilities and vulnerable conditions
○ Do not send attack code at this time
● Execution and exploitation
○ Attempt to exploit targets based on current knowledge
○ Perform situational awareness on the target
○ Attempt local privilege elevation
○ Attempt domain or other system-level privilege elevation
STAY IN
Post-exploitation
● Continue internal and domain enumeration
● Identify domain users/groups/memberships
● Identify the IP space
● Identify file shares
● Establish persistence
● Use the persistence plan to place agents on target systems
● Move laterally
ACT
Operational Impacts
● Perform a realistic simulation against target systems
● Does not need to be highly complex
● Does not need to leverage known or traditional vulnerabilities
● Does not always require administrative (local/domain) privileges
● Does require an actual impact to the target environment
● Does require input from the ECG and TA
● Does require notification to the ECG and TA when the operational impact is executed
○ Avoids unwanted (and possibly catastrophic) defensive actions
● Does need to exercise at least one of the target’s detection, incident response, continuity,
and recovery plans and procedures
Operational impacts are a key distinguisher for Red Teaming engagements vs. other types of tests
Red Team Tip
Operational Impacts provide real insight to the ability
security operations has to defend against threats
Vulnerabilities will be discovered and leveraged;
however, vulnerabilities are a byproduct of a Red Team
engagement, not the focus. A Red Team’s true value is
assisting the target identify administrative, technical, and
procedural controls that limit impacts to the organization
even when vulnerable to the latest “zero-day
vulnerability”.
Operational Impacts
As with any security assessment, risk is what moves an organization to act. Operational impacts are a
Red Team's tool to demonstrate these risks. Impacting an organization's operational capability is one
of the most effective methods of showing risk to an organization's senior leadership.
Operational impacts are actions or effects performed against a target and are designed to demonstrate
physical, informational, and operational weaknesses in security. Operational impacts can be thought
of actions taken against an organization that impacts how it operates. These impacts can be as general
as performing a denial-of-service attack or more specific, such as using hijacked ICS equipment to
control a city’s power grid.
Impacts are typically performed at the end of an engagement; however, it is best to plan the desired
effects early. Early planning allows a Red Team to use the access and capabilities gained to best
position itself for the execution of the impact, known as prepositioning. Other than obtaining and
maintaining access, the Red Team should limit interaction with targets of the operational impact. This
ensures all engagement impact objectives can be exercised at the appropriate time. Often, the Red
Team will receive a request to cause premature impacts within the target environment. These actions
need careful review and consideration before execution. If these actions do not endanger the team's
ability to meet other engagement objectives, they may be executed from other attack spaces and
systems not critical to engagement objectives. If actions directly conflict with engagement objectives,
the Red Team Lead must ensure that the ECG and TA fully and completely understand the
ramifications of each action (to include future operational impacts).
The level of depth and the impact can be as "painful " as an organization is willing to explore. These
impacts are typically performed against live production systems to have the highest level of fidelity
but can be executed on test and development environments if they are representative.
Focus Point
Test environments rarely model production to the level
where operational impacts are felt. The technologies may
match, but the people and processes typically do not.
Focusing on only the test environment can lead to an
unrealistic view of how the impact affects an organization.
Buy-in from management for permission to perform operational impacts can be very difficult. If an
organization is highly risk-averse, these impacts may seem too costly or dangerous. Organizations that
expose their systems to a full-scale attack that includes operational impacts will definitely feel the
pain. However, detailed planning and execution limits real-world impacts, manages potential risks,
identifies gaps in both security and operations, and provides extremely valuable lessons learned to all
stakeholders.
Deconfliction
Deconfliction is the ability to identify which activity is generated by the Red Team and which is not.
In general, Deconfliction:
Separates Red Team activity from real-world activity
Requires prior coordination through a deconfliction process
Mandates Red Team receipt of incident-specific defensive logs
Is not to be used as a Red Team identification process
Requires all detected incidents, whether real-world or alleged Red Team activity,
immediately be reported using normal incident reporting processes
May require the White Cell POC to contact the Red Team’s POC to determine if
discovered activities are the result of the Red Team
It is critical for personnel at all levels of the engagement to be able to quickly and correctly
distinguish Red Team activity from real-world attacks. Several factors can alleviate confusion and the
dissemination of misinformation; however, these four simple actions go a long way in the
deconfliction process:
Ensuring Trusted Agents/White Cell understand the actions and impacts of activities as
they occur
Ensuring all Operator Logs (OPLOGS) are accurately and thoroughly completed
Providing OPLOGS and activity lists to the ECG as requested
Exchanging periodic Situation Reports with the White Cell
Deconfliction Process and Documentation
At a minimum, deconfliction documentation should include:
● Dates of the engagement
● POC for the engagement
Lead
Tech
ECG/TA/Whitecell
● Source of activities
● Destination of activities (as appropriate for the engagement type)
Segment, Range, Application, Host, IP, Building, Campus, etc.
In most scenarios, the destination is not provided
Deconfliction performed via TA/Whitecell
● Description of the activity
In the event deconfliction is requested, the Red Team Lead should work with the responsible
TA/White Cell POC, assess the information, and isolate the information from Red Team activity. This
process may include:
Halting all activities in the area of the incident
Reviewing the ROE for limitations, objectives, and deconfliction instructions
Reviewing OPLOGS to determine the activities the team was conducting at the time
indicated
Confirming or denying Red Team activities for each deconfliction incident
Confirming findings with the ECG, White Cell, and TA
Ensuring findings are relayed by email as well as by telephone
Maintaining records of deconfliction information, actions, assessment, and findings
If the deconfliction process indicates the Red Team is the originator:
Determine and isolate the specific activities and scripts employed (if required)
Determine and isolate the specific logs supporting the time frame of the incident
Notify the Engagement Control Group
The deconfliction process provides an avenue for an engagement to be “gamed” and is susceptible to
biased information flows. Part of the engagement planning process should include determining the
amount of time required to execute the deconfliction process and when to use it properly.
Always emphasize there is no scenario where deconfliction will be used by the target environment or
defenders to identify Red Team sources or activities. At no time should the target environment or
defenders be provided with information outside the deconfliction process, except for safety or legal
incidents.
Deconfliction Process
1. All alerts and incidents, whether real-world or alleged Red Team activity, should
immediately be reported and acted upon in accordance with standard incident response
policies and practices.
2. The appropriate read-in security operations, incident response, threat intelligence, or
management personnel (e.g., Trusted Agent) will promptly notify the Red Team Lead
(or designated proxy) of any reported incidents. This notification must include the
source, destination, action, time of action, and alert source.
3. The appropriate response team will continue to perform operations per policy and
practice.
4. The Red Team Lead will determine if the alert or activity was generated or performed
by the Red Team. This determination will be made by a thorough event operator log
review as well as direct operator interaction.
5. The Red Team Lead will provide the Trusted Agent a confirmation or denial of Red
Team activity.
a. If the activity is real, deconfliction is complete.
i. The Read Team will stand down on any assets involved in the
incident (if used) or temporarily add those assets to a
restricted assets list.
ii. The response team will continue operations
b. If Red Team activity, deconfliction activities will continue.
i. The Trusted Agent must not provide this information to the
security or response team until after completing the process
6. The Red Team Lead and the trusted agent will evaluate the following for determining
what (if any) information should be provided to the response team:
a. The extent to which the activity will cause unnecessary notification of
senior organizational management
b. Activities to be performed by the response team in accordance with
policies and practices
c. How response activities will impact the availability and effectiveness of
the team to detect, identify, and respond to other incidents
d. How response activities will impact the systems and networks of the
incident location
e. How response activities will impact daily operations for those outside the
appropriate response teams
f. Amount of effort required to accurately identify and isolate the Red Team
vs. the benefits of responding to the incident for training, tooling, and
metrics purposes
7. The evaluation actions can be agreed upon by the Red Team Lead and Trusted agent or,
if required, escalated to the appropriate management level (ECG) for approval.
8. The Incident evaluation recommendation should indicate if Red Team and response
teams will continue full-scope activities, if the information will be provided to
constrain activities to an acceptable level of effort, or if operations will be halted.
a. If no information is provided to the response team, full-scope activities
should resume. The response teams should not be notified of Red Team
activity.
b. If information is provided, all teams must log the information and time
provided and the response teams should proceed with response activities
using the provided information as “Threat Intelligence“ or “guidelines.“
c. If specific actions are determined to be too high level of effort all teams
must adjust current activity to accommodate the exclusion of effort. This
can be:
i. Continuance of Red Team but halt of response activities
ii. Continuance of response but halt of Red Team activities
iii. Continuance of Red Team but reduced response activities
iv. Continuance of response but reduced Red Team activities
v. Or halt of all activities
9. Final deconfliction determinations will be actioned and recorded for event reporting as
well as after-action review
After Action Reviews may be used to stimulate improvements to the deconfliction process as well as
incident response or other security operations.
Data Handling
General guidelines to handling data generated or gathered during a Red Team engagement is critical.
All Red Team members should be responsible for safeguarding all target (a.k.a. customer) data,
including:
Personally, Identifiable Information (PII)—information that can be used to uniquely
identify, contact, or locate a single person or that can be used with other sources to
uniquely identify a single individual
Privacy Act information in accordance with established regulations, policies, and
procedures for handling restricted and sensitive information
Other Industry BBP data
A Red Team should avoid the data mining of files containing Privacy Act, medical, justice, worship
or religious pursuit, or any other protected or privileged information. If protected or privileged
information is encountered, the Red Team should pause actions gaining or providing access, protect
the information, notify the ECG, and return it to the target environment (or properly dispose of it as
appropriate to the data type per ROE).
A Red Team is normally authorized to exploit files, email, or message traffic stored on the network or
communications transiting the network for analysis specifically related to the accomplishment of the
objectives (e.g., identifying user IDs, passwords, or network IP addresses in order to gain further
access); however, each Red Team member should ensure all information exploited is necessary and
within the scope of the engagement.
A Red Team should not modify or delete any production user data or conduct any denial-of-service
attacks unless specifically requested or authorized to do so by the ECG or ROE. The team should not
otherwise intentionally degrade or disrupt normal operations of the targeted systems being exploited.
Red Team Operators must follow the provisions as set in the ROE. A properly documented ROE will
contain guidance and rules related to permissions, authorizations, permitted actions, data collection
requirements, and target space details. All Red Team members must adhere to the permissions granted
during engagement planning.
Controls
The controls around handling client data should be agreed upon and documented in the ROE. These
controls are critical. Remember, a Red Team is given the privilege to “play on someone else's
playground.” This access must be respected, and the data captured must be protected.
General controls and suggestions to consider when safeguarding sensitive data follow. Adjust them as
required and incorporate them into your ROE template.
Policy Controls
Policy controls implemented by the Red Team should include:
A Red Team Non-Disclosure Agreement signed by each Red Team member
Data training (identifying and avoiding PII, PIA data, etc.)
Ethics training
Individual background checks
Physical Controls
Multiple levels of physical controls should exist to protect engagement tools and operating systems
from intentional or unintentional loss. Red Team personnel should be familiar with all physical
controls employed (e.g., locks, identification stickers, safes, storage cabinets, and lockable
strongboxes) and their appropriate usage. Every Red Team member is personally responsible for the
protection of target data.
The recommended security mechanisms for securing target assets include:
Tools, computing systems, and target data should be stored inside an isolated, secured
room and controlled only by the Red Team.
Minimize contact between the team and external entities (physical internal/external
access controls into the Red Team space/setup).
When not in use, all data and equipment should be removed and placed into lockable
cases, safes, or storage cabinets.
When traveling, laptops and hard drives will be secured (in a hotel safe, tethered, in a
tethered lockbox, etc.) at all times and never left unsecured in a car, hotel, customer
space, etc.
