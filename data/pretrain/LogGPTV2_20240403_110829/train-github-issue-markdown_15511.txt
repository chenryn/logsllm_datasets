I wrote a script and tried to execute it. The python interpreter stopped the
execution with a traceback saying that
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ".\main.py", line 3, in 
        import lyricsgetter
      File "C:\Users\smart\Documents\Projects\telegram-lyrics-bot\lyricsgetter.py", line 1, in 
        import requests
      File "C:\Users\smart\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\requests\__init__.py", line 53, in 
        major, minor, patch = urllib3_version
    ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 1)
I then tried adding a `print(urllib3_version)` before line 53 in
`__init__.py`.
## Expected Result
`print(urllib3_version)` should have returned the version, and my script
should have executed fine.
## Actual Result
`print(urllib3_version)` printed `['dev']` and stopped the execution of my
script with a `ValueError`
## Reproduction Steps
    import requests
## System Information
    $ python -m requests.help
