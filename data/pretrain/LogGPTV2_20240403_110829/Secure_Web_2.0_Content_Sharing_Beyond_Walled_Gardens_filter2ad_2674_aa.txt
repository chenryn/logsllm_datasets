## Abstract
Web 2.0 users require mechanisms for sharing their content in a controlled manner across the boundaries of content-hosting or application-service providers (CSPs). This paper presents the architecture, design, and implementation of a system that enables Web 2.0 content sharing across CSPs. Our approach allows users to log in to CSPs using their existing email accounts, and content owners can use email-based contact lists to specify access policies. Users need only a web browser, and CSPs do not need to alter their existing access-control mechanisms. Additionally, policy statements are URI-addressable, allowing the same access policies to be reused and enforced across multiple CSPs.

**Keywords:** Web 2.0 content sharing, access control, usability, interoperability, OpenID, OpenPolicy

## 1. Introduction
In the Web 2.0 era, users are both consumers and providers of web content [1]. However, the current web is site-centric, requiring users to maintain separate identities, social relationships, and access-control policies for each service provider. We refer to these administrative domains as "walled gardens." Each walled garden controls its own set of users and employs different access-control mechanisms, making it challenging to share personal content beyond these boundaries.

### Example Scenario
Alice is a Girl Scout in the Colonial Coast Adventures (CCA) club. She took pictures at a scout training event and wants to share them on her favorite photo website, MyPhoto.com. CCA policy dictates that training event photos can only be seen by CCA troop members and their parents. Alice needs to implement this policy, but neither Jenny (another CCA member) nor Mary (Jenny's mother) are registered on MyPhoto.com, and Alice does not know them personally.

### Current Content Sharing Mechanisms
CSPs currently offer two main mechanisms for content sharing:
1. **Public Sharing:** Making user content public, which is inadequate for controlled sharing.
2. **Walled Garden Approach:** Allowing the content owner to grant permissions directly to other users within the same CSP. This approach is easy to implement but limited, as not all desired users (e.g., Girl Scouts and their parents) may be registered with the CSP.

### Distributed Authorization Systems
To address the limitations, distributed authorization systems that support trust and delegation can provide a flexible way for users to delegate authority. For example, Alice might trust the CCA troop to define its members and then delegate the "parent" attribute to those members. Existing systems like KeyNote [2], SPKI/SDSI [3], and RT [4] offer varying levels of delegation support. However, these systems face challenges in usability, interoperability, and the need for CSPs to change their access-control mechanisms.

### Design Goals
Our work aims to address these challenges with the following design goals:
- **Single Account Login:** Users should not need separate accounts and passwords for each CSP.
- **Web Browser Only:** The solution should be accessible with just a web browser, without requiring special software or cryptographic credentials.
- **Additional Sharing Channel:** CSPs should not need to change their existing access-control mechanisms.
- **Confidentiality:** Credentials and access policies should be protected from unauthorized exposure.

### Proposed Solution
Based on our findings, we propose an approach that:
1. **Reuses Email Accounts:** Uses existing email accounts for global identification.
2. **Extends Contact Lists:** Adds trust and delegation to email-based contact lists for access control.
3. **Leverages Secret Links:** Utilizes the existing secret-link mechanism for content sharing.

Our solution consists of two components:
- **OpenIDemail Provider:** An augmented email provider with OpenID identity and email-to-OpenID mapping services.
- **OpenPolicy Provider:** A policy hosting provider for organizing credentials and policies, and for CSPs to make authorization decisions.

### Evaluation
We implemented a prototype on Facebook to allow users to share photo albums with non-Facebook users. The user experience is similar to the existing secret-link sharing mechanism. Content owners use their contact lists to specify delegation-enabled access policies, and content requesters can view shared content using their existing email accounts without needing to set up a Facebook account.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### User Content Sharing Practices
Research by Olson et al. [9], Voida et al. [5], Whalen [6], and Miller et al. [7] has shown that users often abstract sharing into high-level classes and prefer email as the primary sharing mechanism. These studies highlight the importance of simplicity, control, and familiarity in sharing practices.

### Federated Identity Management
Federated identity management solutions, such as CBAC [11], Shibboleth [12], and OpenID [8], aim to simplify user authentication across multiple CSPs. OpenID, in particular, is user-centric and uses URIs as universal identifiers, making it a suitable choice for our proposed solution.
