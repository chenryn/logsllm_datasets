the following two reasons. First, it is well known that many
packet losses happen at edge networks. In the edge networks,
the paths usually have a long link chain without branches. For
example, all paths starting from planetlab1.cs.northwestern.edu
go through the same ﬁve ﬁrst hops. If we use virtual link as
the unit, we ﬁnd the granularity is reduced to about 2.3 virtual

links. This shows our LEND approach can achieve good diag-
nosis granularity comparable to other more biased tomography
approaches while achieving high accuracy.
Second, we ﬁnd that there are some very long lossy MILSs. In
our experiments, some MILSs were longer than 10 hops. Such
long lossy MILSs occur in relatively small overlay networks be-
cause some paths do not overlap any other paths. Fig. 12 shows
the distribution of the length in physical links of lossy MILSs
during different times in a day (US Central Standard Time).
As shown in Section VI-C6, we can further apply the Gibbs
sampling approach [5] based on the MILSs found and obtain
a lower bound on the diagnosis granularity, which is 1.9 phys-
ical links (and one virtual link, obviously). However, accuracy
will be sacriﬁced to some extent as shown in Section VI-C6.
Nevertheless, by combining Gibbs sampling with our LEND
system, we have the ﬂexibility to trade off between granularity
and accuracy.
2) Accuracy Validation Results: We apply the two schemes
in Section V to validate our results: cross validation and consis-
tency checking with IP-spoof-based source routing.
Cross Validation: We split the paths in the basis
into two
sets. We use the ﬁrst set as the input
to the LEND system to
generate MILSs and to infer their loss rates. Then, we use the
measurements of the second part to test the inferred link loss
rates for cross validation. The basic idea is that if a path
in
the second validation set contains some nonoverlapped MILSs
obtained by the inference on the ﬁrst set, then
the loss rate of
should be no less than the total loss rate of
these MILSs because may have some additional lossy links
that are not covered by these MILSs. Assuming the loss rate of
is measured to be and the calculated loss rate of each MILS
is

shows the tolerable value of errors. In our experiments,
is
chosen to be 0.5%. We run the cross validation for each Internet
experiment. The detailed numbers in different experiments are
slightly different, but the cross-validation results are similar.
Therefore, we take one experiment as an example. In this exper-
iment, we have 5720 paths in
, and we choose 2860 of them
to identify 571 MILSs and infer their loss rates. Then, we vali-
date the loss rates against the other 2860 paths. Of 571 MILSs,

MILS-TO-AS PATH LENGTH
320 are on the paths of the second set and, thus, veriﬁed by 2200
paths. The result shows that more than 99.0% paths in the second
set are consistent with MILSs computed by the ﬁrst set. This
shows that the loss rate inference of the MILSs is accurate.
IP-Spoof-Based Consistency Checking: For validation, we
started the loss rate measurements and sent IP spoof packets
at the same time. To reduce the overhead introduced by IP
spooﬁng, we intentionally select the spoofed IP addresses to
only infer the path segments that are more likely to be lossy
based on some previous experiments. We applied the method
introduced in Section V to measure 1000 path segments. Then,
similar to the cross validation, we adopted (5) for matching
validation. Out of a total of 1664 lossy MILSs, 361 are on the
1000 new paths and thus validated. When using the same pa-
, 93.5% of the loss rates of the new spoofed
rameter
paths are consistent with the loss rate of these MILSs. Note
that Internet routing changes may affect the validation results
because once the path routing is changed, the reﬂecting router
may no longer be on the original path, making the validation
inapplicable. Fortunately, Internet routing is quite stable, and
the IP-spoof-based consistency checking thus demonstrates
that the MILS loss rate inference is very accurate.
3) MILS-to-AS Mapping: After we identify the lossy MILSs,
we can locate and study the distribution of the lossy links. For
example, are the lossy links usually within an AS or between
two ASs?
To study this problem, we ﬁrst need to obtain an accurate
IP-to-AS mapping. A complete IP-to-AS mapping can be con-
structed from BGP routing tables by inspecting the last AS (the
origin AS) in the AS path for each preﬁx. Mao et al. show that
the IP-to-AS mapping extracted from BGP tables can lead to
accurate AS-level forwarding path identiﬁcation by changing
about 3% assignment of the original IP-to-AS mapping [27].
However, their available IP-to-AS mapping result was obtained
from measurement in 2003, and it is incomplete—we found that
1/4 of routers on our measurement paths are not mapped to any
AS. Thus, we derive the IP-to-AS mapping from BGP tables di-
rectly, using the BGP tables published in Route Views [28] on
March 2, 2005. The mapping is quite complete, and only 1.6%
IPs involved (end-hosts and internal routers) cannot be mapped
to ASs.
Ignoring these unmapped nodes, we map MILSs to their AS
sequences, then analyze the relationship between lossy links and
ASs. Table VI shows the length of AS paths of the lossy MILSs.
Since it is impossible to infer which link or links are lossy in a
long MILS, we only consider the short MILSs with length 1 or 2,
which consist of about 44% of all lossy MILSs. It is obvious that
most lossy links are connecting two different ASs. For example,
most length 1 MILSs (27.5% of all MILSs) are connecting two
ASs. This observation is consistent with common belief that the
links connecting two ASs are more likely to be congested than
those within an AS.
4) Speed Results: The LEND system is very fast in our In-
ternet experiments. After topology measurement, the average
setup (monitoring path selection, i.e., stage 1 in Fig. 6) time is
109.3 s, and the online diagnosis (stage 2 in Fig. 6) of the 3714
lossy paths for altogether 18 090 paths takes only 4.2 s.
VIII. DISCUSSION
A. Link Properties for Diagnosis
In this paper, we focus on inferring link loss rates, but a nat-
ural question is whether the algorithms are applicable to other
link properties. One difﬁculty is that the linear algebraic model
only works for additive metrics, such as loss rate and latency.
Link bandwidth and capacity are not additive metrics, and there-
fore do not ﬁt the linear algebraic model. Another difﬁculty is
that the good path algorithm will not work if the path proper-
ties are always positive; thus, our approach does not apply to
latency directly (in the directed graph model). However, latency
can be decomposed into propagation delay, transmission delay,
and queuing delay. In diagnosis, people usually care about the
queuing delay, which is zero when the network trafﬁc is light
and becomes very large when congestion happens. Therefore,
the good path algorithm may apply when most paths are over-
provisioned, so queuing delay is negligible for most paths. It is a
future work to conduct experiments to evaluate the applicability
of our methods in this case.
B. Justifying the MILS Deﬁnition
In this section, we discuss other possible identiﬁable units for
diagnosis. Currently, MILSs have very strong conditions:
(cid:129) MILSs consist of consecutive sequences of links.
(cid:129) Each MILS is a subpath of one end-to-end path.
(cid:129) The MILSs are minimal, i.e., one MILS cannot be ex-
pressed as a sum of other MILSs.
(cid:129) Each MILS is identiﬁable, i.e., their properties can always
be uniquely determined by end-to-end properties.
By deﬁning MILSs in this way, we ensure that there are not too
many of them: There may be at most MILSs for each path of
length , and because of path overlap, there will typically be far
fewer than
MILSs overall. By requiring that MILSs be
identiﬁable, we also ensure that we can cheaply compute their
loss rates using Algorithm 1. However, it is possible to relax the
conditions in our deﬁnition, and we consider the effect that more
relaxed deﬁnitions would have below.
As we have shown with Theorem 1, these conditions are so
strong that, in a directed graph, the only MILSs are end-to-end
paths. In order to localize the physically lossy links, we there-
fore used bounds on link loss rates at a granularity ﬁner than that
of the MILSs, which we obtain through the good path algorithm.
With sufﬁciently tight bounds on a few physical links, we are
able to get tight bounds on loss rates for link sequences that are
shorter than end-to-end paths. This suggests that one could relax
the deﬁnition of a MILS to allow some unidentiﬁable MILSs
with loss rates that, though not uniquely identiﬁable, might still
be known to lie within a small interval. The drawback to al-
lowing unidentiﬁable MILSs is that it is impossible to tell which
unidentiﬁable link sequences might have tightly bounded loss
rates from the topology alone.
As we see in the bottom example of Fig. 3, MILSs can overlap
each other. In this example, the sum of the loss rates on physical
ZHAO et al.: TOWARDS UNBIASED END-TO-END NETWORK DIAGNOSIS

links 1 and 4 is uniquely determined by end-to-end measure-
ments, but because those links are nonconsecutive, we add link
3 in order to get the MILS . Therefore, if we allowed noncon-
secutive link sequences to be MILSs, we could conceivably get
more detailed information. For example, if path were lossy,
we might be able to tell that the fault was in link 3 and not in
links 1 or 4. However, the number of possible nonconsecutive
link sequences in each path grows exponentially with the path
length , and so it would be infeasible to test every nonconsec-
utive link sequence to see if it is identiﬁable. While it seems
better to relax the requirement of continuity in MILSs, iden-
tiﬁable nonconsecutive link sequences are quite rare in prac-
tice. We did try several different topologies (synthetic topolo-
gies and Planetlab topology) and found only a small number of
identiﬁable nonconsecutive sequences existed. Compared to the
number of identiﬁable MILSs, they can be ignored. The experi-
mental results suggest that our MILS deﬁnition is quite efﬁcient
and it represents the identiﬁable sequences in the paths.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we advocate a nonbiased end-to-end network
diagnosis paradigm that gives a smooth tradeoff between accu-
racy and diagnosis granularity when combined with various sta-
tistical assumptions. We introduce the concept of minimal iden-
tiﬁable link sequence and propose the good path algorithms to
leverage measurement snapshots to effectively diagnose for di-
rected graphs. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiments show
that we can achieve ﬁne level diagnosis with high accuracy in
near real time. We further design a novel IP spooﬁng based
scheme to validate Internet experiments.
