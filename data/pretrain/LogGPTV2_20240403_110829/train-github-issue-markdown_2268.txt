Right now StorageImpl records a dtype. We should remove the dtype and store
bytes directly. Non-POD dtypes should still support custom destruction, but
that is built on top of an otherwise untyped representation. Representing
storage impls in an untyped way means that we can reinterpret cast tensors,
e.g., view a float tensor as a complex tensor.
In the user side we still expose ByteStorage/LongStorage; these should either
be eliminated from Python, or implemented as wrappers that know dtype.
