**Current behavior**  
I want basic inheritance concept:
    export abstract class AbstractForm{
     abstract data;
     constructor(protected dialog: DialogService){}
    }
    //then use it in component
    @Component({
      selector: 'abc',
      template: '...'
    })
    export class AbcComponent extends AbstractForm{
     data = {}
    // here I don't want create same constructor one more time and call super(dialog) 
    }
But here I get error:
> Uncaught (in promise): Error: Can't resolve all parameters for AbcComponent
> : (?).  
>  Error: Can't resolve all parameters for AbcComponent : (?).
I don't have error with language-service and in my webstorm all seems correct,
I only get this response directly when launch app in browser, even ng serve
and ng build --prod works well, **BUT** even when I decorate my AbstractClass
with `@Component({})` it doesn't works on build and angular language service
tell me
> Error:(9, 2) Angular: Component 'AbstractForm' is not included in a module
> and will not be available inside a template. Consider adding it to a

I don't want add this abstract class into ngModule because it's only an
abstraction and I will never use it inside a template, while on dev mod it
works (even if angular-language-service awar from this)
**Expected behavior**  
I juste want avoid set consctructor again while I don't need specify other DI
it's annoying to always add duplicate code in each component extending this
AbstractForm:
    constructor(protected dialog : DialogService) {
        super(dialog);
      }
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
see above ( can't reproduce on plunkr)
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
avoid annoying duplication of code : i don't want call abstract constructor
using super()... when on child I don't have one; simply use existant
constructor wirted in abstract class
