After installing Python on my Windows 7, I expected to be able to run Python scripts directly from the command prompt. However, this is not the case. I did find that I can use the Python command shell, which is helpful. But how can I save my program in a file and then execute it from the command line, similar to how I would type `python file_name.py` in Linux?

**Response:**

To run Python scripts from the command line on Windows, you need to ensure that the Python executable (`python.exe`) is included in your system's PATH environment variable. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - Open the Command Prompt.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - If Python is installed correctly, it should display the version number. If not, proceed to the next steps.

2. **Add Python to the PATH:**
   - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables."
   - Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and select it. Click "Edit."
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and add the path to the directory where `python.exe` is located. This is typically something like `C:\PythonXX\` (where `XX` is the version number, e.g., `C:\Python39\`).
   - Click "OK" to close all the windows.

3. **Test the Configuration:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window.
   - Type `python --version` again to verify that Python is now recognized.
   - Create a Python script file (e.g., `file_name.py`) and save it in a directory.
   - Navigate to the directory containing your script using the `cd` command.
   - Run your script by typing `python file_name.py` and pressing Enter.

By following these steps, you should be able to run Python scripts from the command line on your Windows 7 system.
