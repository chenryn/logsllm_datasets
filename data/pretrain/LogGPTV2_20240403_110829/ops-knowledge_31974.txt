User: I have just installed Python on my Windows 7. I thought that after that I will be able to run python on the command prompt but it is not the case. After the installation I also found out that I can run the python command shell. This is nice. But what should I do if I want to save my program in a file and then I want to run this program (in Linux, for example, I typed "python file_name.py" in the command line).
Assistant: Is python.exe in your windows path? Try to look at the PATH environment variable and see if the installation folder of python is listed there.
