User: I installed eclipse with pydev plugin. I need to run my existing project on eclipse. But there are relative paths to the files inside my code. I expect from eclipse to append relative paths to the project's default directory. Instead, it appends the relative path to the directory where Eclipse is installed. I could not find a way to solve the problem.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Another way to do it is to go to the 'Environment' tab from the "Run Configuration".  Add a new variable with  name, "PATH", specifying your desired directory in the "Value" box.
