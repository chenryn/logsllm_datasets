I recently installed Eclipse with the PyDev plugin and need to run an existing project within the IDE. However, my code contains relative paths to files, and I expect Eclipse to resolve these paths relative to the project's root directory. Instead, it is appending the relative paths to the directory where Eclipse is installed.

I have not been able to find a solution to this issue. 

Could you please provide guidance on how to configure Eclipse to use the project's root directory for relative paths?

Thank you in advance.

**Assistant:**

One possible solution is to modify the environment settings in the "Run Configuration" for your project. Follow these steps:

1. Open the "Run Configurations" dialog.
2. Select the configuration for your project.
3. Navigate to the "Environment" tab.
4. Add a new environment variable with the name `PATH`.
5. In the "Value" box, specify the desired directory (i.e., the project's root directory).

This should help Eclipse resolve the relative paths correctly.
