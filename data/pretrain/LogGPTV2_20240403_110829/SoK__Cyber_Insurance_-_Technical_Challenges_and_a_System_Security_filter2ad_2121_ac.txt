qualitative description, whilst others opt for a quantitative numerical
sliding scale (e.g., Table I3 and H3 of [101]). It is worth pointing
out that the same event could be assigned different values across
distinct situations: if an organization’s public statement is “we have
built our reputation on our commitment [. . . ] to protect the privacy
and confidentiality of personal information”, the impact of user-data
leaks for this company will be higher if compared to another one
with different prerogatives. The next step is the identification and
mapping of existing mitigations or controls the could reduce the
likelihood of each threat: companies often take advantage of existing
frameworks that list critical checks and best practices, and indicate
the extent to which the control environment reduces the inherent risk.
As a result, a value reflecting the residual risk is obtained and a three-
fold choice opens up: if the value falls within the company’s risk ap-
petite limit, no further action is needed in this phase. If not, more con-
trols and mitigations have to be investigated or the residual risk has to
be transferred to a third party —e.g., with a cyber-insurance policy.
Finally, in the last sub-category of Figure 2, we reported all the
methodologies that have been proposed to aggregate and propagate
individual risks based on tools that capture the relationships
among different information components or requirements of an
attack. These modeling tools make use of graph theory or model
checking to draw conclusions starting from some preconditions.
Among them, attack trees are widely used techniques to capture
dependencies among threats [104]–[109]. Each tree is a leveled
diagram made of nodes, leaves and a root; each node represents
an attack or a threat which materializes only if all its children are
satisfied. The root attack is completed if all nodes are satisfied.
Similarly, vulnerabilities or exploits are represented as nodes in
attack graphs and conditionally linked to each other according to
their preconditions and results. Such composition of vulnerabilities
is used to simulate incremental network penetration and attack
likelihood propagation with the purpose of measuring the overall
security of a system or network [110]–[113]. Finally, hazard and
operability studies (HAZOP) [100] and failure mode and effects
analysis (FMEA) [114], are other two techniques used to break
down a complex process into small sections and reason about
possible undesired situations, their causes and consequences. Such
kind of tools are mostly employed when the use of ICT can
introduce a series of hazards in industrial environments [115]–[117].
As we will discuss later in this section, these methodologies,
inherited from other domains, can be unsuitable when employed
in cyber scenarios.
C. Cyber insurance and Game Theory
A large portion of existing contributions employ mathematical
modeling and game theory to infer properties and effects of adopting
cyber insurance. As comprehensively reported in [19], this approach
allows in the first place to create a mathematical model of cyber
insurance which takes into account its main actors (insurance car-
riers, policyholders and regulatory entities), their interdependences
(probability of infection and externalities), the network topology
(independent nodes, complete graph, random graph, or others) and
the market type (competitive, monopolistic, or oligopoly). Once
a model has been defined, game theory is used to simulate the
behavior of agents: insureds choose their desired level of protection
and contract type, insurers instantiate contracts, and regulators come
into play by imposing regulation options (mandatory insurance,
fines, bonuses, penalties, mandatory investment, etc.). The use of
game theory makes it possible to also include in the models the major
issue of information asymmetry in its moral hazard and adverse
selection forms. This way of tackling cyber insurance is very useful
for strategic purposes and allowed researchers, practitioners, and
governments to reason about consequences and peculiarities of its
employment, and market viability.
1) Viability of the cyber-insurance market: As already discussed,
the starting point of each simulation is the definition of a
mathematical model of cyber insurance that considers its main
aspects, e.g. market type, type of coverage, existence of asymmetric
information, network topology, etc. Therefore, an important finding
of each simulation is to verify whether the market defined by such
pre-conditions may exist or not, i.e., whether the actors would opt
for the insurance case over the non-insurance one. One way to
achieve this result is the comparison between the average utility
function for agents with (E[U I]) and without (E[U N ]) insurance:
in the economic theory, this function measures the welfare or
satisfaction of an entity from consuming a certain number of goods.
Then, if E[U I]≥E[U N ] holds, the choice of an insurance policy
directly contributes to increase the wealth of an agent [19]. Almost
all previous works —among which we find the more realistic
settings that include a competitive insurance market, non-zero-profit
carriers, the presence of moral hazard and adverse selection, and
a partial coverage whose level is defined by the policyholder— fall
in this category [42], [80]–[82], [84], [86]–[89], [91], [93]. Only
two studies found that actors who decide not to invest in a cyber
policy would benefit from this choice [93], [94]. Yang and Lui [93]
concluded that cyber insurance is not a good incentive for all nodes
when modeling a competitive market with zero-profit carriers only
offering full coverage and accepting asymmetric information in its
moral-hazard form. Naghizadeh and Liu [94] simulated instead a
monopolistic profit-neutral insurer, acting as a regulator that imposes
fines and grants rebates, and found that this leads to a market failure
because of agents would not voluntarily purchase any insurance.
2) Consequences of cyber-insurance employment: Among
the main topics of interest in this area, we find the use of cyber
insurance as an incentive for internet security [79], [83], [84],
[86]–[90], the change in self-protection investments when insurance
is available [79]–[85] and its contribution for reaching the social
welfare [79], [87], [91], [92]. These studies concluded that cyber
insurance is not a good incentive for internet security in presence of
a competitive or monopolistic market and asymmetric information
in its moral hazard form [42], [83], [84], [86], [87]. On the
other hand, researchers also concluded that a non-competitive
cyber-insurance market can increase internet security if fines are
imposed by regulation entities and policy are carefully designed.

When analyzing the effect of employing cyber insurance on
self-protection, some works show that, if insurance is available,
agents prefer not to invest in self-protection, but rather in insurance
contracts [133], [134]. In this case, minimal investments imposed
by regulators do not change the results. Finally, the usefulness of
insurance as a tool to reach the social welfare and the optimal level
of self-protection investments has not been yet understood: different
studies [88], [135] reached contradictory conclusions on this topic
although considering the same preconditions, probably because of
adopting different network topologies —which lead to different
interactions among actors— throughout their simulations.
D. The Economics Perspective
Since cyber attacks are often considered inevitable events,
cyber experts are increasingly focusing on their economic
consequences [119]. In this respect, scenario-based evaluations
are a very common approach used to serve two main purposes.
For a company, these scenarios provide a useful way to assess
the possible consequences of a cyber event [123], to measure the
incident response capabilities [122], and to identify the critical
systems, people and premises that are needed to continue to serve
their customers [120]. On the insurance carriers side, simulations
based on scenarios are often used to estimate the financial impact
of large-scale attacks or catastrophic events that hit many businesses
at once [121]. This simulation practice is rapidly gaining popularity
due to the current cyber landscape, in which the costs of recovering
from particular types of attacks are way greater than the cost required
to prevent them [118]. Furthermore, tests can help companies to
emphasize the presence of valuable data to protect and shed light
on interconnected risks that could lead to catastrophic events [119].
Good evidence of this can be found in the decision of the European
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to include,
for the first time in 2018, cyber scenarios in the collective insurance
stress test used to assess cyber-risk response [136].
The creation process of a scenario-based simulation goes through
a multi-stage procedure [60] and it is usually performed by C-Suite
executives due to their expertise in business-critical roles and
operations [119]. The process starts with the creation of a plausible
scenario, defined by a footprint of events to be simulated and a
contagion mechanisms among the involved entities [124]. There is
a wide range in the type of scenarios that can be used for different
applications. For instance, scenarios can be based on historical or
synthetic events, they can be generic or specific for a given company
or sector, and they can consider single or multiple events [125].
Scenarios allow the simulation of both common digital incidents
—like data exfiltration, cyber extortion, denial of service attacks,
financial transaction compromise, and cloud service provider failure
— as well as rare events — such as cyber-induced fires in buildings
or industrial plants, cyber theft of marine cargo, cyber attacks on
power grids, or oil rig explosions due to platform control system
(PCS) compromise [126].
Developing a scenario is a challenging task as it is not easy to
fully understand all the systems involved and predict the possible
cascading effects that could be triggered [60]. For this reason, devel-
oping a coherent scenario is a key aspect for successfully achieving
the second phase of the simulation that consists of estimating the
inducted losses to a business or the impact of claims submitted to
an insurance company by taking into account its client portfolio.
The output of the simulation can be further extended beyond
a single company by taking into account macroeconomic
consequences too [124]. This result can be achieved by selecting a
representative subset of the whole population of companies from a
wide range of different business sectors and use them to estimate the
losses of a given scenario. In turn, this allows for a quantification
of the effects on many variables of the global economy [60].
Besides scenario-based simulations, other economic studies
attempted to gain insights into cyber risks by leveraging publicly
available data. For instance, Eling and Loperfido [128] analyze sta-
tistical properties of a data breach information database to show that
data breaches significantly differ among each other, hence they must
not be put in the same basket but must be mapped to separate risk
categories. Using another dataset of publicly available survey data,
Herath et al. attempted instead to build a pricing model for cyber-
insurance premiums with the robust copula methodology [127].
Premiums for first-party losses due to virus intrusions are computed
with a probabilistic model based on three factors: the occurrence
of the events covered by the policy, the time from the issue of the
policy to the incident, and the indemnity paid by the insurance
in case of the breach occurring. Biener et al. [16] analyzed the
world’s largest collection of publicly reported operational losses to
draw empirical conclusions on whether cyber risks are insurable

or not based on Berliner’s criteria. Results suggest that cyber risk
owns some peculiarities that undermine its insurability, such as its
evolving nature, the lack of actuarial data and reinsurance, the severe
information asymmetries, the limited coverage and caps, and the
high deductibles and premiums for small and medium enterprises.
Wheatley et al. [129] statistically modeled a 15-year cyber-breach
dataset to show that the size of an organization is strongly coupled
with the frequency and severity of breaches, and the number of
information leaked during such events is expected to double within
five years from two to four billion items. The handling and response
costs of two data breach events are at the center of the study by
Layton et al. [130]. Counterintuitively, the authors show that none
of the two incidents negatively affected the company stock price and
economic growth, secondary and intangible losses have negligible
importance with respect to direct losses, and policy and procedure
