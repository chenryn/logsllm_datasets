User: A quick question for Python 2.7
Are global variables visible to a subprocess?
Can a subprocess change the values of global variables?
Many thanks.
Assistant: The processes doesn't share the variables in a general operating system terms. Use some communication mechanism like message passing, shared memory etc to achieve the inter process communication.
