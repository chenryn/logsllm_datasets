I'm used to this from KeyPirinha (well, a plugin), so bear with me:
I'd like to be able to sleep, restart, shut down, log off and hibernate from
PTR. I could make programs to do this and have them in my start menu to work
around this for now, but this feels like something that would (a) not bloat
the runner and (b) be quite universally useful
