##### Issue Type:
Feature Request
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.6.5
##### Environment:
My situation is that I have a Mac OS X 10.9 machine which I am running Ansible
from. I want to manage Ubuntu 12.04 hosts.
##### Summary:
Forgive me if this is a duplicate (I find it hard to imagine I'm the first to
encounter this) but I have spent a lot of time searching for an answer.
My situation is that I have a Mac OS X 10.9 machine which I am running Ansible
from. I want to manage Ubuntu hosts, ergo they require apt. I'm unable to find
out how to install the python-apt or aptitude modules on my Mac, which of
course means I cannot do rudimentary package management on the remote Ubuntu
hosts, which ultimately means I'm unable to use Ansible to provision my
systems.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
N/A - Self explanatory.
##### Expected Results:
Expected to be able to use apt: related modules in playbooks.
##### Actual Results:
Apparently unable to use apt module from a Mac OS X machine when managing
Ubuntu machines.
