### Issue Type:
Feature Request

### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.6.5

### Environment:
I am running Ansible from a Mac OS X 10.9 machine and need to manage Ubuntu 12.04 hosts.

### Summary:
I apologize if this issue has already been reported, but I have spent considerable time searching for a solution without success. My setup involves using a Mac OS X 10.9 machine to run Ansible and manage Ubuntu 12.04 hosts. To do this, I need to use the `apt` module for package management on the remote Ubuntu hosts. However, I am unable to install the necessary Python modules (`python-apt` or `aptitude`) on my Mac, which prevents me from performing basic package management tasks on the Ubuntu hosts. As a result, I cannot effectively use Ansible to provision my systems.

### Steps To Reproduce:
N/A - The issue is self-explanatory.

### Expected Results:
I expected to be able to use `apt`-related modules in my playbooks when running Ansible from a Mac OS X machine.

### Actual Results:
I am unable to use the `apt` module from a Mac OS X machine when managing Ubuntu machines.
