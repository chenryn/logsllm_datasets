### Technological Design and Its Limitations in Addressing Relationship Dynamics

**Technological Design Overlooks Relationship Changes:**
- **Example 1:** The "SafeBand" system, designed to protect victims, includes a wearable device and two mobile applications. The victim can wear the device as a wristband or locket, which features a button and a light. When the button is pressed, it uses GPS to identify the user's location and sends a message with this information to the nearest police station and pre-saved contacts (e.g., relatives) [173].
- **Example 2:** Many apps intended for victim support are difficult to find in the App Store, limiting their visibility and utility to potential users [160].
- **Example 3:** Survivors face significant challenges in erasing their electronic footprints, requiring more effort and technical knowledge than their abusers need to track them. Redressing this imbalance will require measures such as redesigned websites, history-cleaning technologies, and training [68].

**Concerns and Challenges:**
- **Victim Safety and Abuser Access:** There is a need to protect victims from abusers who may have access to victim information due to their jobs, including law enforcement roles [43].
- **Technology Safety and Privacy:** Young women emphasized the importance of technology being safe, raising concerns about the possibility of abusers or other parties viewing their browser history or recently used apps [178].
- **Accessibility for Disabled Users:** Accessibility for clients and service providers with disabilities is a concern, especially given the limited financial resources available to these agencies [43].
- **Fear of Retaliation:** Survivors often fear provoking further abuse if their abuser discovers they are seeking help [68].
- **Limited Scope of Apps:** Many apps are limited in scope, providing intervention materials to only a narrow group of users, typically female victims of male perpetrators [160].
- **Exploitative Practices:** Some apps, like We-Consent, were packaged with other apps and charged fees, which could be seen as exploitative [157].
- **Usability Under Stress:** The effectiveness of the solution can be compromised by the user's mental state. Survivors under duress might struggle to use features that would normally be straightforward [118].
- **Dynamic Relationships:** Social networking sites do not account for the dynamic nature of relationships, assuming that a "friend" remains a friend [93].

### Issues with Technological Solutions

**Victim Blaming:**
- **Design Encourages Victim Blaming:** Some solutions place the responsibility on victims to prevent violence, rather than focusing on perpetrator education [39].

**Security and Privacy:**
- **Security Breaches:** Security breaches pose a significant threat, especially given the sensitive nature of intimate data [204].
- **Lack of Safety Evaluation:** Solutions are not evaluated for victims' safety, and app developers should consider the potential harmful uses of their apps [37].

**Human Support:**
- **Lack of Human Interaction:** Online interventions without human interaction are seen as less effective by young women, who value the "human touch" of real-life support [178].
- **Need for Integrated Support Systems:** Technological advances must be accompanied by legal and social support systems, such as the recognition of new digital evidence techniques [79].

**Usability and Maintenance:**
- **Poor Usability:** Survivors under stress may make mistakes when using privacy and security features, highlighting the need for better usability design [32].
- **Lack of Regular Updates:** Many apps are not regularly updated, leading to broken links and outdated information [160].

**Diverse User Needs:**
- **Complexity of Abuse:** Abuse can take many forms, including coercive control and various types of abuse, and it is important to recognize the diverse experiences of survivors [68].

### Use of Technology in Evidence Gathering

**Challenges with Evidence:**
- **Multiple Technological Sources:** Gathering evidence through multiple technological sources, such as social networking sites, emails, and SMS, can be overwhelming [87, 61].
- **Ambiguous Evidence:** Evidence collected through ambiguous technological forms can be excluded in court [78].
- **Revictimization:** Victims feel responsible for gathering evidence, which can lead to revictimization [58].

**Stakeholder Knowledge Gaps:**
- **Unfamiliarity with Technology:** Stakeholders, including law enforcement, may not be familiar with the use cases of technology in evidence gathering [90, 78].

### Government and Service Provider Involvement

**Surveillance and Privacy:**
- **Government Surveillance:** The use of surveillance systems, such as EUROSUR, to track victims and perpetrators can raise privacy concerns [78].
- **Hiding Shelters:** Google has worked with organizations to hide victim shelters in Google Maps and Street View to protect privacy [39].

**Jurisdictional Challenges:**
- **Cross-Border Issues:** Law enforcement faces challenges when perpetrators or content are outside local jurisdictions, making it difficult to proceed with investigations [90].

**Privacy Concerns:**
- **Invasive Tracking:** While tracking technology offers new opportunities for intervention, it can also be highly invasive on a person's privacy [78].
