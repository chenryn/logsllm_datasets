#### Technology Overview
- **Common Healthcare Technologies**
  - **HL7 (Health Level 7)**
    - A standard for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information.
  - **DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)**
    - A standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging.

#### The Importance of Standards
- **A History of Standard Non-standard Standards**
  - Despite the existence of standards like HL7 and DICOM, the implementation and adherence to these standards can vary widely, leading to inconsistencies and vulnerabilities.
- **Why Should You Care?**
  - **HIPAA Compliance**: While HIPAA provides guidelines for protecting patient data, it does not offer the same level of detailed security requirements as PCI DSS for the financial sector.
  - **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: These are highly sensitive and valuable, making them prime targets for identity theft and medical identity theft.
  - **Severe Consequences**: Breaches can lead to significant harm, including loss of life and limb.

#### Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)
- **Overview**
  - PACS are used for the storage, retrieval, distribution, and presentation of images.
- **DICOM**
  - **Network Protocol**: Facilitates the communication of medical images and related information.
  - **File Format**: Used for storing and transmitting medical images.
- **Fuzzing DICOM**
  - Fuzzing is a technique used to test the robustness of DICOM implementations by inputting unexpected or malformed data to identify vulnerabilities.

#### HL7 Interface Systems
- **HL7 Protocol and Standards**
  - HL7 is a clear-text protocol with delimited fields that can contain codes or data. Subfields can also contain codes or data.
- **Centralized Data Storage and Structure**
  - HL7 routers manage the flow of messages between different systems.
- **Fuzzing HL7**
  - Similar to DICOM, fuzzing can be used to test the resilience of HL7 systems to malformed or unexpected inputs.

#### Electronic Health/Medical Record Systems
- **Medical Record Storage**
  - Health records are often stored in multiple systems, including databases and unstructured data files.
- **Front-End Interfaces and Issues**
  - Common web application issues include logic flaws related to user permissions.
- **Health Information Exchanges (HIE)**
  - HIEs aim to build a national healthcare system through legislation, but the interconnectivity of immature systems can introduce vulnerabilities.

#### Personal Health Records (PHR)
- **Overview**
  - PHRs allow individuals to manage their health information.
- **Providers**
  - Examples include Health Vault by Microsoft and Google Health.
- **Malicious Health Records (MHR)**
  - Attackers can inject malicious health records into PHRs, which can then be parsed and acted upon by backend systems like HL7 routers, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.

#### Medical Hardware Review
- **Prescription Dispensing Cabinets**
  - Examples include Omnicell cabinets, which are used for managing and dispensing medications.
