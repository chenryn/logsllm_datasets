### 1. Introduction and Overview

**Security is a game in which the final goal is never quite in reach.**

#### 1.1. Introduction

Computers have become ubiquitous in every aspect of modern society. Our reliance on computers to manage and store everything from national secrets to personal purchases is rapidly increasing. Information has become the most valuable commodity, being bought and sold to the highest bidder. It is crucial that information about individuals, corporations, and governments is not inappropriately disclosed, maliciously altered, or destroyed. The threats are diverse, ranging from disgruntled employees and corporate spies to hackers who aim to cause harm. A robust method for controlling these and other attacks is essential to prevent significant damage to society. To achieve this, it is necessary to be able to construct secure computer systems.

The ability to derive the properties of an assembly of components from the properties of its individual parts is fundamental to designing secure computer systems. A system with this capability is said to be composable. Unfortunately, the knowledge of how to construct such secure systems has been lacking. The goal of this work is to provide the necessary foundations to build secure computer systems.

The remainder of this introductory chapter will provide some background information and state the thesis of the work.

#### 1.2. Security Properties and Systems

The primary goal of computer security is to prevent unauthorized access to or acquisition of information. Achieving this goal has been challenging. To meet this objective, systems must satisfy specific security properties, which define the acceptable behaviors of a system. Significant work has been done to develop formal models of information flow to understand how to prevent unauthorized information flows. Despite these advances, a complete theory of information flow in secure systems is still lacking.

#### 1.3. Composability

Engineers have long used standard, pre-designed components to design systems, achieving economies of scale and other benefits. This approach allows designers to use a repertoire of existing components rather than starting from scratch each time. However, this type of design has not been possible for secure systems. The critical missing technology is the ability to create a composite trustworthy system using a heterogeneous collection of existing products. John McLean succinctly states the problem:

"A general ability to build composite high-assurance systems presupposes a general theory of system composition. Such a theory provides insight into why certain properties are preserved or not preserved by certain forms of composition. More importantly, for a large class of properties and a variety of composition constructs, it answers questions of the form: 'if a system satisfying property X is composed with a system satisfying property Y using composition construct Z, what properties will the composite system satisfy?'" [McLean94]

In this work, we examine security properties under composition and propose a solution to the problem identified by McLean.

#### 1.4. This Thesis

This thesis focuses on a theory of composing components into systems such that the information flow properties of the composed system can be predicted from the properties of the components and the nature of their interconnections. As reviewed in Chapter 2, this problem has a long history with mixed results. Our objective is to present a new perspective that develops deeper insights into the control of information flows in composed systems.

The thesis posits that we can predict the security property satisfied by a composed system from those of its constituent components. We determine conditions for a property to emerge under composition and demonstrate how to determine if a state machine representation of the system satisfies the security property.

#### 1.5. Overview

- **Chapter 2** provides a brief review of relevant related research, including security modeling, trusted systems, and composability.
- **Chapter 3** introduces the model of the systems we will consider, formally introducing the notion of component composition and other notation.
- **Chapter 4** defines security properties, investigates their nature, and provides a method for specifying and comparing them. It also demonstrates that current approaches to system composition are not applicable to security properties.
- **Chapter 5** presents our theory of secure composition, investigating compositions with and without feedback, and providing a means to determine when a property may emerge under composition.
- **Chapter 6** compares our work and results to McLean’s Selective Interleaving Functions (SIF).
- **Chapter 7** presents a method for determining if a non-deterministic state machine satisfies a particular property, showing that our approach encompasses most security properties in the literature.
- **Chapter 8** summarizes the work, provides conclusions, and suggests directions for future research.

### 2. Previous Work

**"No great man lives in vain. The history of the world is but the biography of great men."**
— Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), Scottish writer

#### 2.1. Introduction

This chapter introduces some of the related research in the areas of composability and formal modeling of systems, with a focus on the research that directly informed this thesis.

#### 2.2. Event Systems

Our work aims to predict the effects of interconnecting systems, modeled using discrete event systems. These systems describe the possible observed behavior rather than the internal workings. At the core of all event system models is the concept of a trace, which is a temporally ordered series of events representing one possible execution of the system. A formal introduction to event systems is deferred to Chapter 3.

#### 2.3. Confidentiality Models

We present some previous work in confidentiality, which is the property that information should not be made available or disclosed to unauthorized users. This section is not an exhaustive exposition of security properties but provides relevant background.

##### 2.3.1. Lattice Approaches to Security

Bell and LaPadula [Bell & LaPadula75] introduced a model of security policies for military systems. Their model (BLP) was one of the earliest successful treatments of confidentiality and formed the basis of U.S. Department of Defense criteria. BLP is based on access control requirements, formalized by the axioms of simple security and the *-property. Simple security restricts read access, while the *-property restricts write access based on security levels.

Denning [Denning76] extended the BLP model by noting that the classification of subjects and objects forms a lattice of security levels. The BLP properties have straightforward extensions to this lattice model. However, several shortcomings have been noted, including the need for trusted subjects and the difficulty in describing all information using the object representation.

##### 2.3.2. Formal Criteria

Formal criteria are the security policies by which the security of systems is established and verified. The issue of composability has not been addressed by any formal criteria released by the United States, European Community, or Canadian government. The Canadian Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria (CTCPEC) [CTCPEC], released in January 1993, mentions the issue of composability but notes that current research has not advanced enough to include composability requirements.

“Efforts have begun to work out methods of evaluation based on composable products. As research continues, composable evaluation of properly defined composable products will enter the mainstream from the research arena. Composable products and evaluation would allow Vendors to modify existing trusted products and retain or improve their ratings without having the entire product re-evaluated.” [CTCPEC]

A detailed discussion of the underlying requirements is not warranted here, but the production of these criteria has significantly influenced the development of security policy and practice in various sectors.

##### 2.3.3. Possibilistic Security Properties

In 1982, Goguen and Meseguer introduced the notion of noninterference as the basis for confidentiality. They defined noninterference as follows: "One group of users, using a certain set of commands, is noninterfering with another group of users if what the first group does with those commands has no effect on what the second group of users can see." [Goguen & Meseguer82]

Noninterference was the first possibilistic security property, where the idea is that if information of a given security level interferes with information of a different security level, the interference should be attributable to more than one possible cause. Numerous other security properties have since been proposed, each building on and refining these foundational concepts.
