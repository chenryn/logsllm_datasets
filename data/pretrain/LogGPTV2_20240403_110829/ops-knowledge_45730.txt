User: Is it possible to specify site directories through python command line or environment?
Right now I'm using site.addsitedir, but I would like to make the script agnostic of the site-setting logic
Assistant: The PYTHONPATH environment variable is essentially the same thing. Set it to a directory containing Python modules or packages and it will be added to sys.path at initialization.
