with our earlier observations in Fig. 2.
The fact that delay distribution in most monitors of the same operators mainly
come from the same population is quite interesting. First, recalling the large dif-
ferences between operators, it seems that each operator has its own ”signature”
in the delay characteristics. Second, it shows that the delay characteristics of a
connection is mainly network-dependent rather than monitor-dependent.
3G access network plays a central role in deciding delay characteris-
tics. The 3G access network seems to play a central role for the delay charac-
teristics. We cannot directly measure this (since there are no IP hops in this
network), so we investigate this by looking at delay correlations between moni-
tors at diﬀerent geographical distances. We ﬁrst calculate the temporal correla-
tion between all pairs of RTT time series from the same operator. To construct
these time series, we use one month of delay measurements per monitor, divide
it to ﬁve-minute bins, and calculate the average RTT in each bin. Second, we
examine how temporal correlation between two time series varies in relation to
the geographical distance between the respective monitors. To estimate correla-
tions between monitors, we use the non-parametric Kendall’s τ rank correlation
coeﬃcient [5]. τ takes value between -1 and 1, and it represents the diﬀerence
between the probability that the observed data are in the same order in both
samples and the probability that they are not.
The left panel in Fig. 4 depicts τ ’s CDFs for monitors that are at most 100km
apart for all operators. The MBB operators demonstrate stronger correlation
than the ﬁxed network. In the middle panel, we plot the τ ’s CDFs corresponding
to our ﬁxed line monitors. Each curve represents correlations between monitors
that are within a speciﬁc distance range from each other. We observe that the
temporal correlation between the ﬁxed line monitors is generally low (τ ≤ 0.3 in
almost 80% of the cases). Furthermore, distance between monitors has a negligible
impact on their correlations.
Interestingly, we observe a quite diﬀerent behavior in the MBB networks.
Monitors that are up to 300km apart are strongly correlated. Beyond that the
correlation properties are similar to those of ﬁxed line monitors. The right panel
in Fig. 4 illustrates this for HSP A1. Monitors in EV -DO and HSP A2 behave
similarly. It is natural to relate this behavior to the architecture of 3G networks,
where geographically close base stations share the same Radio Network Con-
troller (RNC). This result shows that the 3G access network is an important
contributor to the overall delay characteristics, and indicates that queuing at
the Base Station Controller (BSC) level plays an important role.
The access network is a decisive factor for delay, but is not
responsible for outliers. The common wisdom is that last mile delay con-
stitutes a large fraction of end-to-end delay in wireless networks. The last mile

Fig. 5. Last mile delay characteristics
includes the part of the 3G network between an end device and the ﬁrst IP hop
in the respective provider’s cloud (i.e. the GGSN). In a wired network, the last
mile corresponds to all physical infra-structure that lies between a customer’s
access device (e.g. ADSL modem) and the ﬁrst gateway in her ISP’s network.
In order to quantify the contribution of the access network to observed RTTs,
we consider the ratio (r) of the last mile RTT to the end to end RTT. We employ
our traceroute measurements to estimate the last mile latency (i.e. by extracting
the RTT to the ﬁrst IP hop in the respective provider’s network). The left panel
in Fig 5 illustrates r’s CDF, each curve is estimated by combining r values
from all monitors of the corresponding operator. As expected, we observe a clear
diﬀerence between the ﬁxed network and the three wireless interfaces. In the ﬁxed
network, r is less than 10% in 50% of the cases, but in the wireless networks it
is more than 50% in 90% of the cases. We also note that the contribution of the

access network to observed RTTs is higher in HSP A1 than in EV -DO than in
HSP A2. The last observation is in accordance with our earlier ﬁndings.
Several factors contribute to the last mile latency including modem perfor-
mance, signal quality, queuing in the access network beyond the ﬁrst wireless
hop, and the impact of diﬀerent components in the access network (e.g. RNC).
The middle panel in Fig. 5 shows the relation between last mile RTTs, measured
in all EV -DO monitors, and the received signal strength (SS) represented as a
percentage of the best attainable signal quality. Note that, the SS we measure
only covers the received signal. We observe that last mile RTTs increase as SS
deteriorates. In our future work, we plan to investigate the impact of other fac-
tors (e.g. queuing in the access network beyond the ﬁrst wireless hop) on the
last mile delay.
Finally, we ask whether the access network is responsible for the very high
delay values that we sometimes experience. The right panel in Fig. 5 depicts the
relation between r and RTTs aggregated across all HSP A1 monitors. Surpris-
ingly, we observe that r decreases as RTT increases, suggesting that such large
RTTs are caused by performance degradation beyond the access network, i.e.,
in the GGSN or at the IP path from the GGSN to the measurement servers.
EV -DO and HSP A2 show a similar behavior.
3G delays exhibit clear diurnal patterns. To indirectly measure coarse-
grained traﬃc patterns, we explore how delay varies throughout the day. The
plots in Fig. 6 shows the median delay of HSP A1 and EV -DO as a function in
the time of the day. To calculate for operator X at hour H, we collect all RTTs
from all measurements from X that are recorded at hour H throughout May’11
and then ﬁnd their median4.
Not surprisingly, we ﬁnd clear diurnal patterns in delay. This has earlier been
reported in many studies from ﬁxed networks [3]. Interestingly, delay peaks at
diﬀerent hours in our measured networks. While HSP A1 delays are highest
during business hours, EV -DO shows a diﬀerent pattern with higher delays in
the evening. We have been in contact with EV -DO, and they conﬁrm that they
see more traﬃc in their network at these hours, probably because they have a
large number of home and recreational users.
4 July data show similar patterns.

4 Related Work
Laner et. al [8] measured 3G uplink delay in an operational HSPA network and
showed that the average delay is strongly dependent on the packet size. Further,
they found that last mile delay constitutes a large fraction of measured delays.
The authors in [4] analyzed packet delay in UMTS networks and identiﬁed ARQ
loss recovery mechanisms as the main cause behind the high variability in packet
delay. Arlos and Fiedler [1] measured the inﬂuence of the packet size on the
one-way delay (OWD) in 3G networks in three diﬀerent operators in Sweden.
They showed that choosing an optimal packet size signiﬁcantly reduces OWD. In
contrast with previous work that measured delay in 3G networks, we provide a
more complete study that involves two diﬀerent 3G technologies, three operators
and about 60 monitoring points.
Other papers (e.g.
[6,9]) measured diﬀerent set of performance metrics in
3G networks; including TCP and UDP performance, throughput, and network
resource allocation.
5 Conclusions
This work presents a ﬁrst look on long-term measurements of MBB data con-
nections from 3 diﬀerent network operators in Norway. More speciﬁcally, in this
paper, we investigate the characteristics of round trip delays with a focus on the
role of the 3G access network. We observe large diﬀerences between operators
with respect to both absolute delays and variations. Access network latency con-
stitutes a signiﬁcant part of the total delay. However, its share drops at large
RTTs. We also observe that delays in 3G networks exhibit clear diurnal patterns
that peak at diﬀerent hours during the day depending on the operator.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the delay characteristics in diﬀerent 3G networks
are mainly network-dependent rather than monitor-dependent, and that each
operator has its own ”signature” in the delay characteristics. These ﬁndings in-
dicate that diﬀerences between MBB operators are mainly dictated by the way
their access networks are designed and conﬁgured. The important role played
by the 3G access network in deciding delay characteristic is further conﬁrmed
through analyzing correlations between monitors of the same operator. The iden-
tiﬁed strong correlation between geographically close 3G monitors indicates the
presence of signiﬁcant infrastructure aggregation within each operator access
network.
