  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04
  * Theme: Dark+ (dark default)
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Create file test.js
  2. Add code to test.js
    var a = 1, b = 2,
          c = 3, d = 4;
The a and b variables get colored (light blue on this theme), the c and d
variables get no color (white on this theme).
Also, whe you use the variable it get no special color, but I'm not sure if
this is intended. I would prefer it colored as well.
All variables get no color, nor the console.log (the hole line is white on
this theme):
    console.log(a,b,c,d);
