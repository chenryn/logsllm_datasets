User: I am using Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way" and have gotten Python to work.  I made a file and saved it as ex1.py.  I type the command
python ex1.py
This does not recognize the file like it should and instead gives me this
can't open file 'ex1.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
I have checked and double-checked it.  There is definitely a ex1.py file saved in my Local Disk (C:).  None of the common errors on his tutorial include mine.  Any tips?
Assistant: I got it to work finally, I had it in a folder under the path
C:\Users\MyUser\PythonTest\ex1.py
This was wrong, however when I made it
C:\Users\MyUser\ex1.py
It worked, thanks for all the help!
