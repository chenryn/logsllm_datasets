User: I have checked out a folder from SVN to my desktop. Actually I need to extract the information like SVN revision no, URL and status for the specific file in the local working copy. Here is the line of code which I am using to extract those info.
file = svn.local.LocalClient(filePath[i][j])
fileInfo = file.info()
This works perfectly fine in my desktop. But the same thing when I tried to do it in my laptop it throws the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\svn-0.3.22-py2.7.egg\svn\common.py", line 134, in export

  File "C:\Python27\lib\subprocess.py", line 948, in _execute_child
    startupinfo)
WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
Can anyone pls help me what is wrong? I have installed all the packages which I installed in my desktop. But don't know what is the problem exactly.
Thanks
Assistant: You need to recheck that the files on your laptop and make sure:

The files actually exist / are the correct files.
They are in the directory you are trying to access them from.
The file names are spelled correctly.

If the system could not find the file specified it means something is missing / misplaced, or the file you are trying to access is not spelled the same as the one you actually want. Its most likely a simple error that could be found by just looking over everything and making sure its all the same as your desktop.
