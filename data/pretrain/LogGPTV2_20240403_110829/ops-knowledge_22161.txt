### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:09:52 to 18:09:57 on October 18, documents a series of attempts and failures in connecting to and renewing leases with a server. The key components and issues are as follows:

1. **RMCommunicator Allocator (org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client)**
   - **Connection Attempts:**
     - The RMCommunicator Allocator is attempting to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030`.
     - It is configured to retry up to 10 times, with a 1-second (1000 milliseconds) interval between retries.
     - Each connection attempt is logged with an `INFO` level, indicating that it has tried 0 times so far and will continue to retry.
   - **Address Change Detection:**
     - The allocator detects an address change from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`, which is logged at the `WARN` level.
   - **Error in Contacting RM:**
     - The allocator logs an `ERROR` each time it fails to contact the Resource Manager (RM).

2. **LeaseRenewer (org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer)**
   - **Lease Renewal Failures:**
     - The LeaseRenewer is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
     - The failure duration increases by one second with each log entry (from 295 seconds to 299 seconds).
     - Each failure is logged at the `WARN` level, and the system indicates that it will retry shortly.
   - **Address Change Detection:**
     - The LeaseRenewer also detects an address change from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`, which is logged at the `WARN` level.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Levels:**
  - The log entries are timestamped and include the log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR), process ID, relevant software component, and the log content.
  - The log levels indicate the severity of the issues, with `INFO` for informational messages, `WARN` for warnings, and `ERROR` for critical errors.

- **Recurring Patterns:**
  - The RMCommunicator Allocator and LeaseRenewer both experience recurring issues, with the allocator trying to connect to the server and the renewer failing to renew the lease.
  - The address changes detected by both components suggest a possible network or configuration issue.

- **Retry Mechanisms:**
  - Both components have built-in retry mechanisms. The RMCommunicator Allocator retries up to 10 times with a 1-second interval, while the LeaseRenewer will retry after a short period.

### Conclusion

The log chunk highlights ongoing connectivity and lease renewal issues, with both the RMCommunicator Allocator and LeaseRenewer encountering repeated failures. The address changes detected by both components may be a contributing factor to these issues. The system is designed to handle these failures through retry mechanisms, but the root cause of the connectivity and lease renewal problems should be investigated further.
