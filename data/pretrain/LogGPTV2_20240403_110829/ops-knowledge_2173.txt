Question: An IT security professional is explaining the security features of recoveryOS and the software update process on Intel-based Mac computers. Which of the following statements accurately reflect the security measures or procedures implemented by Apple for these systems?
"A": "The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware checks the signature of the BaseSystem.chunklist file and then validates each hash from the BaseSystem.dmg to prevent unauthorized booting from recoveryOS.",
"B": "During the software update process, the user's data volume is always mounted to ensure data integrity while preventing unauthorized access.",
"C": "The software update process uses a hardware-based root of trust to install only Apple-signed code and prevent downgrade attacks by not signing older operating system versions.",
"D": "For the software update personalisation, the nonce is used to ensure that the server's response can be reused for system software tampering or alteration."
