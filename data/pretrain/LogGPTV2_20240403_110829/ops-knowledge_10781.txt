Question: A web application uses a list-based protection mechanism to filter incoming requests based on predefined safe input patterns. However, a security analyst notices unusual behavior when certain unexpected inputs are processed. Which of the following scenarios could indicate that the protection mechanism is too permissive?
"A": "The system allows a request with an input pattern that closely resembles a known safe pattern, but it carries a slight variation that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability.",
"B": "The list enforces strict type checking and only permits inputs that exactly match the safe patterns, resulting in a reduced number of accepted requests.",
"C": "A user's input is rejected because it matches an entry on a blacklist, even though the input is a common, non-malicious data entry.",
"D": "The system only allows inputs that have been digitally signed by a trusted authority, effectively preventing any unauthorized data from being processed."
Answer: A
