  * Electron version: the one bundled with Atom 1.7.1, also 0.36.0
  * Operating system: Linux
The "focus()" call does not actually focus the window, it only raises it.
Focus remains in the caller app (terminal, for instance).
No "focus stealing prevention" is used. This can be reproduced on multiple
window managers (xfwm, unity).
Steps to reproduce, using Atom (as an example -- works with any other
Electron-based app that focuses itself):
  1. open terminal
  2. `atom myfile.txt`
  3. switch back to terminal
  4. `atom myfile.txt`
  5. note that Atom raised itself, but the focus is still in terminal.
