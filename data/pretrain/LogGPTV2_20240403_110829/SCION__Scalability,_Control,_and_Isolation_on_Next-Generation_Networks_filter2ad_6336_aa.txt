Abstract—We present the ﬁrst Internet architecture designed
to provide route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust
information for end-to-end communications. SCION separates
ASes into groups of independent routing sub-planes, called trust
domains, which then interconnect to form complete routes. Trust
domains provide natural isolation of routing failures and human
misconﬁguration, give endpoints strong control for both inbound
and outbound trafﬁc, provide meaningful and enforceable trust,
and enable scalable routing updates with high path freshness. As
a result, our architecture provides strong resilience and security
properties as an intrinsic consequence of good design princi-
ples, avoiding piecemeal add-on protocols as security patches.
Meanwhile, SCION only assumes that a few top-tier ISPs in
the trust domain are trusted for providing reliable end-to-end
communications, thus achieving a small Trusted Computing Base.
Both our security analysis and evaluation results show that
SCION naturally prevents numerous attacks and provides a high
level of resilience, scalability, control, and isolation.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Internet is the most geographically, administratively,
and socially diverse distributed system ever invented. While
today’s Internet architecture admits some administrative di-
versity, such as by separating routing inside a domain (intra-
AS routing) from global inter-domain routing, it falls short
in handling the key challenges of security and isolation that
arise in this intensely heterogeneous setting. As a result, we
see surprisingly frequent incidents in which communication is
interrupted by actions or actors far from the communicating
entities. In addition to classical examples such as YouTube
being globally disrupted by routing announcements from Pak-
istan [1], other issues surrounding the lack of resource control
and isolation are not solved by existing proposals such as S-
BGP [2]: the introduction of excessive routing churn [3]; trafﬁc
ﬂooding; and even issues of global conﬂicts over naming and
name resolution.
This paper proposes a clean-slate Internet architecture,
SCION, that provides strong guarantees for failure isolation
and route control in ways that map well to existing geographic,
political, and legal boundaries. We show that strong control
and isolation naturally leads to security and reliability without
the use of high-overhead security mechanisms, while exposing

to the endpoints diverse communication path sets that can sup-
port a wide spectrum of routing policies and path preferences
(path expressiveness).
We introduce the notion of a hierarchy of trust domains
whose members all share a common contractual, legal, cul-
tural, geographical, or other basis for extending limited trust
among each other. Examples may be a domain of U.S.
commercial and educational institutions, ISPs that participate
in the same peering point who share a common, binding
legal contract on their behavior, or ISPs in the same state
or country who are subject to the same laws and regulations.
Using this abstraction, we provide the machinery to guarantee
control-plane isolation: Entities outside a trust domain cannot
affect control-plane computation and communication within
that trust domain. For communication that must span trust
domains, we provide the property that the entities who can
affect
the communication are limited to a necessary and
explicitly identiﬁed set of other trust domains. We leave data-
plane security as future work and thus do not consider denial of
service attacks. In addition, the introduction of trust domains
enables sources, transit ISPs, and destinations in SCION to
agree jointly on which path to use. The architecture naturally
controls routing information ﬂow, and provides for explicit
trust in path selection.
Through isolation and control, SCION enables expressive
trust, i.e., all the communicating endpoints can decide and
control explicitly and precisely whom they need to trust for
providing reliable communications. Exposing such explicit
trust information for end-to-end communication can eventually
beneﬁt network availability, because the endpoints can select
more “trusted” communication paths with presumably more
reliable data delivery; or at least, SCION holds the parties
involved in the communications accountable for their misbe-
havior and failures.
Contributions. We design and analyze SCION, an Internet
architecture emphasizing the principles of control, isolation
and explicit
trust. SCION enables route control for ISPs,
senders and receivers at an appropriate level of granularity,
balancing efﬁciency, expressiveness, policy compliance, and
security. The isolation properties dramatically shrink the TCB
and make explicit which entities communication relies upon.
SCION offers strong security properties and demonstrates that
the resulting routes widely mirror those in place under BGP
today. We anticipate that the proposed architecture offers a
useful design point for a next-generation Internet.

II. LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT ROUTING DESIGN
To motivate our new design, we ﬁrst demonstrate four fun-
damental limitations of current inter-domain routing protocols.
Through concrete examples and discussion, we show that
recent popular inter-domain routing protocols [4]–[11], even
with their semantics perfectly secured (e.g., via S-BGP [2] like
approaches), still lack several important security properties.
Limitation 1: Arbitrary information ﬂow. Many current
inter-domain routing designs use path-vector routing because
it supports rich routing policies [12] and is more scalable
compared to link state. In addition to BGP, recently proposed
protocols such as MIRO [6], R-BGP [7], Routing Deﬂec-
tions [9], and ACR [10] also use path-vector route dissemina-
tion. These routing systems, however, give endpoints and ISPs
little control over how their routing announcements propagate,
which causes several security vulnerabilities. Speciﬁcally, once
a node N announces its preﬁx, path, or pathlet to its neighbors,
N has no control over the way in which its routing update is
further propagated and paths are constructed for reaching N .
Figure 1(a) depicts an example scenario. Destination AS
1 is served by provider AS 2; the source AS 5 is likewise
served by AS 4. An intermediate AS 3 peers with both
providers; the providers do not peer with each other directly.
If AS 3 wishes to control the route between the source and
destination, it can forward the route it learns from AS 2
to AS 4 even if S-BGP is used. Because routes announced
by peers are generally preferred over routes announced by
providers, this will likely result in the destination using the
AS-PATH {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Such a path violates the valley-free
routing principle that a node should not provide transit service
between two providers or peering neighbors. Such violations
can cause routing convergence problems, where upon topology
changes, the routing table at each node may not converge to the
updated, correct routing paths [13]. Using conventional routing
security measures, such as S-BGP, which only secures the
strict semantics of path vector, it is impossible to distinguish
this route from a legitimate route. Currently, the only practical
method for dealing with such anomalies is to use hand-tuned
ingress or egress ﬁlters to custom-conﬁgure the system, which
can be error-prone and cause inconsistencies [14].
Figure 1(b) depicts a second example, where the endpoint
AS E is the destination of trafﬁc. AS E generates a route
advertisement for its address preﬁx which is propagated
through its provider A; this advertisement is further propagated
into separate paths P1 and P2 going through B and M ,
respectively, and re-converging at AS C. Suppose AS C selects
P2 to re-advertise; then P1 is discarded and all inbound trafﬁc
to E now must pass through the AS M which is less preferred
by E.
In summary, routing systems with undirectional and un-
regulated ﬂow of routing update dissemination can suffer
from three problems: (i) “valley” paths can inhibit routing
convergence; (ii) paths can traverse ISPs untrusted by the
source node; and (iii) the routing system is generally subject
to arbitrary blackhole and wormhole attacks. This unprinci-
pled manner of path construction is a well-known source of
persistent Internet route ﬂuctuation [13].

(downstream/upstream) relationships. Large arrows indicate constructed paths.
In Figure 1(b), P1 is preferred by the endpoint E but P2 is the path that is
used.
Limitation 2: No joint path selection between source
and destination. The lack of joint path selection between
the source and destination nodes prevents effective defenses
against Denial-of-Service attacks. Traditional path-vector rout-
ing lets intermediate ASes select which routes to advertise
to other peers and customers from the set of announcements
they receive from their neighbors. Endpoints have no con-
trol over path construction. Newer proposals for multi-path
routing [4]–[6], [9] recognize that the users of a path – the
communicating endpoints – should have the ﬁnal say over
a route’s acceptability. These proposals let the source select
from a set of diverse paths, but they do not similarly empower
the destination to control its inbound trafﬁc, as illustrated in
Figure 1(b). Consequently, the destination has little inbound
trafﬁc control to avoid using particular untrusted nodes for its
own communication.
Limitation 3: Lack of routing isolation. A central tenet
of current inter-domain routing architectures is reachability,
where a routing announcement from any AS can potentially be
propagated throughout the entire Internet. In other words, most
(if not all) ASes are in the same routing dissemination domain.
For example, in addition to the aforementioned multipath rout-
ing protocols, NIRA [15] organizes all the ASes in one tree-
based routing domain, and Landmark routing [16] also makes
the routing “landmarks” available throughout
the network.
While such global visibility helps achieve global reachability,
it also enables individual malicious ASes to easily launch
attacks affecting the entire Internet. For example, two distant
colluding ASes can announce a (non-existing) wormhole link
between each other to create a (bogus) short path, which can
be seen potentially by the entire Internet and thus attract trafﬁc.
Limitation 4: Lack of route freshness. An adversary who
can delay or drop messages can force trafﬁc to continue to use
an older path p with obsolete state. Because routing updates
from each AS have global scope, current inter-domain routing
protocols send only incremental routing updates after route
changes to achieve scalability. Unfortunately, this incremental
manner of routing updates sacriﬁces route freshness, as the
loss of updates concerning a path p (such as path withdrawal
messages) can prevent other ASes from knowing that path p
has changed. Consider the example in Figure 1(b), where the
213
AS PATH {C, M, A, E} is active to reach destination E. Sup-
pose that A withdraws the path {A, E}, but the malicious AS
M intentionally suppresses this withdrawal message from C.
Consequently, the same AS PATH {C, M, A, E} still remains
active, because in path vector routing B only withdraws a path
{B, A, E} instead of a speciﬁc link, which does not invalidate
the path through M .
III. SCION OVERVIEW
SCION has three grounding principles: domain-based iso-
lation, mutually controllable path selection by both the end-
points and intermediate ISPs, and explicit trust for end-to-
end communication, as Section III-A details. These principles
provide a framework within which SCION achieves resilience
to routing attacks. The rest of the section provides an overview
of the SCION architecture.
A. Design Principles
Principle 1: Domain-based isolation – Dividing the routing
control plane into independent domains. Isolation among
independent domains protects routing in one domain from
malicious activities and routing churn in other domains. This
beneﬁts both security and scalability while retaining reacha-
bility and path diversity across domains. For example, SCION
enables frequent routing updates to periodically refresh path
state, so that each AD always maintains a fresh (and accurate)
network topology for efﬁcient routing decisions.
Principle 2: Mutually controllable path selection – Joint
path selection between source and destination. SCION
greatly increases both the source and destination’s ability to
affect, select and control the construction of the routes to
and from themselves, while still respecting intermediate ISPs’
routing policies.
Principle 3: Explicit trust and small TCB for end-to-end
communication. By segregating mutually distrustful entities
into different trust domains, each trust domain can choose a
coherent root of trust (e.g., a few tier-1 ISPs) for bootstrapping
trust among ADs in the same trust domain. As a result, an
endpoint E knows and is able to choose explicitly whom to
trust for achieving reliable end-to-end communication, while
untrusted ADs in other trust domains cannot affect the path
discovery and route computation of E. Consequently, an entity
only has to trust a small subset of the network thus achieving
a small TCB for end-to-end communication.
B. Hierarchical Decomposition
Our architecture deﬁnes the Autonomous Domain (AD) as
the atomic failure unit, representing both ISPs (or transit ADs)
and endpoint ADs. Large ISPs would be split into multiple
ADs, based on their topology of separately administered do-
mains. SCION divides the ADs in the Internet into a hierarchy
of trust domains, or TDs, as shown in Figure 2, used to
provide the domain-based isolation property. A TD is a set
of ADs that agree on a coherent root of trust and have mutual
accountability and enforceability for route computation under
a common regulatory framework.

Each TD has a TD Core, a set of designated ADs forming a
mutually reachable clique that interfaces with other TDs. ADs
in the TD core naturally serve as the egress/ingress ADs of
the corresponding TD. In the current Internet, the top-tier ISPs
would constitute the TD Core.
We envision the effort to establish a TD to closely mirror
