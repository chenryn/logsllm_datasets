# Summary
This isn't necessarily a _bug_ , but it's an interesting find. It's probably
even intentional.
Anyway, instead of rewriting the `Math.floor(Math.random() * (1 - 3 + 1)) + 1`
code three times, I wanted to try writing a custom function to generate the
numbers:
    function generateRandomNumber(min, max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (min - max + 1)) + 1;
    }
    slotOne = generateRandomNumber(1, 3);
    ...
The result is the same, but the last test is marked wrong because I didn't
retype the random number generation line. No big deal! Just thought I would
make mention of it.
