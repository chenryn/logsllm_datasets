Assistant: This log chunk shows that the system detected and corrected 1 DDR error on rank 0, symbol 10, bit 0 on 2005-08-19. On 2005-08-16, it detected and corrected a CE sym 22 error. On 2005-08-21, it detected and corrected a CE sym 3 and CE sym 20 error. On multiple occasions, it generated core files for programs located in various directories. Finally, on 2005-08-23, it generated 128 core files for the program located in /home/germann2/BGL-demo/SPaSM_mpi and a fatal error occurred when trying to access the directory /home/germann2/BGL-demo.
