Requirements: Identical to critical fixes.
2.5 Global evolvability requirements
In addition to the scenario-specific evolvability requirements above,
features that aim to support evolvability in an Internet that runs many
diverse routing protocols must satisfy two global requirements.
G-R4 Inform islands and gulf ASes of what protocols are used on
routing paths.
G-R5 Avoid loops across all protocols used on routing paths.
This first is needed to allow islands to make informed routing
decisions, give gulf ASes more visibility, and to inform sources how to
create multi-network-protocol headers. The reasoning for the second
is obvious.
2.6 Needed evolvability features
All of the requirements above can be satisfied by two complementary
features. The first is pass-through support, which allows routers or
ASes to pass through control information for protocols they do not
support to adjacent ones. This allows protocols’ control information
to cross gulfs (CF-R1).
The second feature is a multi-protocol data structure that encodes
what protocols are used by islands on routing paths (G-R4). It pro-
vides the additional building block necessary to facilitate discovery
of islands running custom protocols (CP-R3). (See Section 3.4 to see
how this data structure can enable off-path discovery).
Encoding the multi-protocol data structure within the baseline’s
advertisements enables in-band dissemination (CF-R2). It also allows
all protocols, including the baseline, to use a common loop-detection
mechanism (G-R5).1
Comparison to BGP: Pass-through support is provided in BGP
via its optional transitive attributes [44], but it is not presently used
to deploy new routing protocols. BGP does not provide a system-
atized multi-protocol data structure or loop detection mechanism
that allows multiple, diverse inter-domain protocols to co-exist.
1With additional support from islands, loops can be avoided even if multi-protocol
support is provided out-of-band.

Integrated advertisements
3.2
Integrated advertisements (IAs) extend existing BGP advertisements
to provide multi-protocol support. Each IA compactly describes a
path that can be used to reach a destination address, named using
the baseline address format. Figure 4 shows an example IA for a
path, which includes a Wiser [32] island (AS 3), a SCION [63] is-
land (Island A), a MIRO [60] island (Island G), an AS in a gulf (AS
4000), and a BGPSec [8] island (Island K). Only fields relevant to
multi-protocol support are shown, so standard BGP fields, such as
withdrawn prefixes have been omitted.
The path-vector field states the path. It is the common denominator
that all protocols on the path must use to avoid loops. We allow island
IDs or AS numbers to be listed and delegate the choice to individual
islands. Islands that list their IDs abstract away their intra-island paths
from D-BGP’s loop-detection mechanism. Doing so is necessary for
islands running certain replacement protocols whose within-island
paths cannot be expressed in a path vector (e.g., hybrid path-vector /
link-state ones [53]). Islands may also choose to list their IDs because
it simplifies effort needed to deploy a new replacement protocol using
D-BGP or because they wish to hide intra-island paths for competitive
reasons. Islands that list their IDs reduce path diversity for member
ASes because this forces loop detection to work at the granularity of
entire islands. Paths that enter and leave the island multiple times
without causing AS-level loops will be thrown out.
In the figure, Island A, which runs SCION, has chosen to list only
its island ID in the path-vector field, perhaps due to competitive
concerns. If it wishes to mitigate reduction in path diversity, it would
need to list every AS on the multiple within-island paths it offers in the
path-vector field to prevent loops. To prevent gulf ASes from thinking
the IA presents an overly long path, the island could optionally list
these AS numbers within an AS SET relationship. (BGP’s decision
process prefers shorter AS-level paths.) This is similar to what BGP
does today when aggregating multiple advertisements for contiguous
destination addresses at proxies (i.e., at transit or tier-1 ASes) [44].
Island G, which runs BGP in parallel with MIRO, a custom pro-
tocol, exposes only its AS-level BGP path to the destination in the
path-vector field. It does not expose details of its alternate paths
because their use is coordinated out-of-band of BGP.
The island ID field allows membership of ASes listed in the path
vector to be identified. It is necessary to tell routers how to layer
headers when encapsulating data packets to cross BGP gulfs and use
custom or replacement protocols on routing paths. In the figure, AS
4000 does not have an island ID since it is part of a BGP gulf. AS 3
uses its AS number as its island ID as it is a singleton island.
Path descriptors fields bear resemblance to BGP’s path attributes,
but are explicitly structured for multi-protocol support. They describe
per-protocol attributes of the entire path. Critical fixes use them to
encode their control information. The example shown in Figure 4
includes Wiser’s scaled path cost [32] and BGPSec’s attestations [8].
Other potential path descriptors include Xiao et al.’s [59] and EQ-
BGP’s [6] QoS metrics. Since BGPSec requires an unbroken chain
of participation, starting from the destination, to provide benefits,
island K could optionally drop the attestation before sending it to
insecure islands. We include it here for illustrative purposes.
Figure 4: An example D-BGP integrated advertisement.
To our knowledge, BGP does not have an explicit analog to island
descriptors. These fields encode attributes specific to individual is-
lands. Islands that support custom protocols use them to facilitate
discovery. Those that use replacement protocols use them to encode
their control information. Those that support two-way protocols use
them to identify how upstream islands can exchange control infor-
mation with downstream islands. Note, this exchange must be done
out-of-band of D-BGP using existing (baseline-only) paths because
BGP is a one-way protocol. Stub islands that use a different address
format than the baseline (e.g., IPv6 or content names [62]) can use
island descriptors to help establish a mapping between the two for-
mats. For example, an island could originate an IA for a gateway and
include an island descriptor with the address of a lookup service. The
service would contain within-island addresses that can be reached
via the gateway. This would let islands route traffic among themselves
using the new format.
The example IA shown in Figure 4 shows a Wiser island’s descriptor.
It includes the address of a portal downstream neighbor islands can
contact to periodically send the path costs of paths they receive from
this island. The IA also includes a descriptor for the SCION island,
which lists two within-island paths that can be used to reach the
destination. They are specified at the granularity of border routers,
which have been assigned random IDs (e.g., br1). The descriptor for
the MIRO island enables on-path discovery. It includes the IP address
of a portal that customers can contact to exchange relevant control
information.
Limiting IA sizes: Critical fixes listed in IAs can share control
information that is identical across them and BGP. This can drastically
reduce IA sizes, as critical fixes often disseminate the same control
information as BGP except for one or two extra protocol-specific
fields (e.g., BGPSec [8] disseminates only one extra field: a path
attestation). In Figure 4, BGP, BGPSec [8], and Wiser [32] all share
control information.
Custom and replacement protocols’ contribution to IA size will
be small because they do not need to disseminate much control
information outside their islands. For example, a SCION island that
disseminates five within-island paths, each consisting of five intra-
island hops, will only need to disseminate about 200 bytes of control

IAs can be compressed to further reduce their size.
IA processing
3.3
D-BGP modifies BGP’s advertisement processing to support IAs,
provide pass-through support, and give gulf ASes some visibility and
control. For clarity, we first describe how D-BGP’s advertisement
processing enables evolvability for critical fixes and custom protocols.
We then expand our discussion to include replacement protocols. We
briefly describe the role of D-BGP’s various import/export filters in
this section, but a detailed discussion of how they might be used to
implement the new types of policies and AS relationships possible
in an Internet running multiple inter-domain protocols is out of the
scope of this paper.
Figure 5: D-BGP’s IA processing. (1): Global import filters are applied to the
IA and it is forwarded to the protocol extractor and the IA DB. The AS number
could be added at this stage or at the output filter. (2): The protocol extractor
determines the active protocol for the prefix and extracts control information
specific to it. It also extracts shared control information, such as the path
vector, neighbor that sent the IA, and prefix to allow them to be also used
during path selection. It forwards all of this information to the appropriate
decision module. (3): Protocol-specific import filters are applied and control
information is stored in the decision module’s RIB. (4): The decision module’s
path-selection algorithm selects a new best path for the IA’s prefix. It forwards
the new best path to the data plane and the its control information to the
export filter. (5): Protocol-specific export filters are applied and the best path’s
control information is sent to the IA factory. Control information could have
been modified at any stage within the decision module. (6) The IA factory
creates a new IA for the prefix by including the modified control information.
It provides pass-through functionality by copying over unused protocols’
control information from the incoming IA for the best-path selected into the
new one. (7): Global export filters are applied to the new IA and the IA is
sent to neighbors. These filters may replace within-island AS numbers with a
single island ID depending on the island’s policy.
filters specific to the relevant protocol. At a minimum, these filters
will modify per-protocol control information. Protocols that are guar-
anteed not to be active at the same time may be able to share some
data structures, such as RIBs (not shown).
Third, it includes an IA factory, which replaces similar functionality
for BGP’s advertisements. The IA factory is responsible for receiving
IAs and communicating the per-protocol and shared information
contained in them to active decision module(s). It is also respon-
sible for creating new IAs for selected best paths. The IA factory is
agnostic to per-protocol information; it only needs to know the active
protocols’ IDs to do its job.
The IA factory provides pass-through functionality when creating
new advertisements for selected best paths. Specifically, when creating
new IAs for a selected best paths, it indexes into a database of received
IAs to retrieve the incoming IA for the chosen best path. It then
copies over all control information for protocols in the incoming IA
that were not used for best-path selection to the new one. This is
(somewhat) similar to the pass-through functionality provided by
BGP’s optional transitive attributes today [44].
Supporting islands running replacement protocols: In this case,
D-BGP is only used at islands’ borders. Each replacement protocol
Figure 5 shows D-BGP’s advertisement processing, which could be
running either within ASes’ border routers or within ASes’ centralized
BGP speakers. It also shows the steps required to receive an incoming
IA, select best paths, and create a new IA. This IA processing module
belongs to an island that has recently deployed a critical fix to BGP
(shown in purple or dark grey). Previously, it was using BGP (shown
in blue or light grey). The island may support custom protocols, but
they are not shown in the figure as they do not affect processing of
incoming IAs or best-path selection. D-BGP’s processing includes the
following novel components needed to support IAs and pass-through
control information.
First, it includes global import/export filters, which allow operators
to enforce policies common to all protocols, but perhaps specific to
individual neighbors (e.g., valley-free routing [38]). Gulf ASes’ opera-
tors can use global filters to assert a limited amount of control over
what protocols can be used on their paths. For example, they could
remove control information for protocols known to be problematic
(they would only need to know the protocol ID to do so).
Loop detection is implemented at the global filtering stage, either
at the ingresses (input filters) or egresses (output filters) of ASes. This
is similar to BGP’s processing, but is now extended to all protocols
contained in IAs. At the egresses of islands, output filters are used
to state island membership or abstract away intra-island details. The
former is accomplished by a filter that adds an island ID to the island
ID field and states which set of contiguous AS entries in the path
vector correspond to member ASes. The latter is accomplished by
a filter that removes the most recent set of contiguous path-vector
entries that correspond to member ASes and replacing them with a
single island ID.
Second, it includes multiple decision modules, corresponding to
BGP and the critical fixes it supports. Only one protocol and hence
decision module is active at a time for a given address range. Having
multiple protocols be active for the same range would add little value
because only a single protocol’s path choice can be installed in a
single IP forwarding table. The processing module shown in Figure 5
includes a decision module for BGP (shown in blue/light grey) and
one for a critical fix (shown in purple/dark grey). Only the critical
fix’s module is active because operators have chosen to route all traffic
through it.
Each decision module encapsulates the data structures (e.g., RIB
and path-selection algorithm) a given protocol uses to select best
paths. Decision modules can optionally include import and export

must provide a decision module. It must also additionally provide a
redistribution module, an ingress translation module, and an egress
translation module. The redistribution module interposes between the
data plane and protocols’ decision modules to redistribute routes into
BGP. Ingress and egress translation modules encapsulate the protocol’s
decision module to map between IAs and the replacement protocol’s
advertisement format. The ingress module is responsible for preserv-
ing D-BGP path vectors and the egress module is responsible for
encoding within-island paths into D-BGP path vectors. The global
filter may replace these within-island paths with a single island ID.
If the replacement protocol does not provide its own multi-protocol
and pass-through support (or is based on link-state [53]), that is-
land’s border ASes must coordinate to exchange unused protocols’
information (and the ingress D-BGP path vector if it is not directly
compatible with the replacement protocol).
