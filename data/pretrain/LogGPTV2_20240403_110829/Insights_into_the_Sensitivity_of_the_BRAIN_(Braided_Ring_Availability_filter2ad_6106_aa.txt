Insights into the Sensitivity of the BRAIN (Braided Ring Availability Integrity 
Network)—On Platform Robustness in Extended Operation 
Abstract 
Low-cost  fault-tolerant  systems  design  presents  a 
continual  trade-off  between  improving  fault-tolerant 
properties  and  accommodating  cost  constraints.  With 
limited hardware options and to justify the system design 
rationale, it is necessary to formulate a fault hypothesis 
to bound failure assumptions. The system must be built 
on  a  foundation  of  real-world  relevance  and  the 
assumption of coverage of the fault hypothesis.

This  paper  discusses  a  study  that  examines  the 
sensitivity of a BRAIN (braided ring availability integrity 
network) design to different fault types and failure rates 
in  a  safety-relevant  application.  It  presents  a  Markov-
based model (using ASSIST, SURE, and STEM analysis 
tools)  and  a  series  of  experiments  that  were  run  to 
analyze 
the  BRAIN 
approach. The study evaluates the mission reliability and 
safety  in  the  context  of  a  hypothetical  automotive 
integrated  x-by-wire  architecture  on  top  of  the  BRAIN. 
Drawing from experience in the aerospace domain, the 
authors investigate the possibility of continued operation 
for  a  limited  period  after  a  detected  critical  electronic 
failure.  Continued  operation  would  allow  a  driver  to 
reach repair facilities rather than stopping the vehicle to 
call for roadside assistance or ”limping home.” 
1. Introduction 
Commercial  cost  pressure  and  the  maintenance  and 
repair capabilities at remote airports have made extended 
operation  despite  faults  and  aircraft  dispatch  with  fault 
common in the aerospace domain. Extended-range Twin-
engine Operation Performance Standards (ETOPS) is an 
example  of  this  practice  that  regulates  twin-engine 
airplane  operations  and  defines  clear 
limits  on 
operational  duration  in  the  event  of  engine  failure. 
Similarly,  minimum  equipment  lists  (MEL)  in  aircrafts 
provide  clear  guidelines  to  pilots  when  a  dispatch,  in 
spite  of  a  fault  in  a  subsystem,  is  permitted.  MELs are 
established through detailed analysis of the safety effect 
on 
the  aircraft.  E.g.,  ARP5107  provides  specific 
guidelines for engine electronics [31].  
This  paper  extrapolates  the  concept  of  extended 
operation despite faults to a hypothetical electronic x-by-
wire platform in cars [1]. Continued operation for longer 
periods  is  not  necessarily  required  for  the  mission 
success  (such  as  safe  landing  of  aircraft),  but  allows  a 
level  of  comfort  or  commercial  benefits—for  example, 
the ability to drive the car home or to the garage in case 
of a failure to avoid towing. For safety-relevant systems, 
such  as  fail-operational  by-wire  systems,  the  safety 
implications of continued operation despite faults require 
careful consideration. 
Generally,  safety  and  reliability  analyses  of  systems 
have  been  published  and  mature  industry  practices  for 
conducting  safety  case  assessment  (ARP4754  [9], 
ARP4761 [35]) are in place. Often, the safety aspect is 
seen  in  the  context  of  available  hardware  or  effects  of 
certain  external 
[36].  This  paper 
acknowledges  the  value  of  these  analyses,  but  extends 
the safety analysis in several dimensions: 1) in addition 
to  available  hardware,  the  effect  of  integrity  faults  is 
considered;  2)  effects  of  platform  algorithms 
is 
considered;  3)  systems  purely  evaluating  reliability  do 
not consider periods of extended operation until repair.  
failure  modes 
We  wished  to  examine  extended  operation  because 
repair may not be immediately available, and the system 
needs  to  be  operational  for  some  time.  During  this 
interval,  the  system  may  be  especially  vulnerable  to 
additional  faults—both  hardware  exhaustion  and  integ-
rity violation. A good example in automotive systems is 
the  “limp  home  mode,”  where  the  car  operates  in  a 
degraded  mode,  but  is  still  operational  [14].  While  the 
effects  of  additional  failures  may  be  reduced,  safety 
relevant functionality and associated guarantees need to 
be maintained.  
Our goal in this paper is to look at the reliability from 
a  platform  perspective.  System  safety  can  be  truly 
contemplated  only  within  a  systems  context—including 
application,  hazards, 
factors,  user 
influence,  etc.  However,  since  a  platform  builds  the 
foundation  of  a  system,  the  strength  and  dependability 
vulnerabilities  of  the  platform  directly  impact  hosted 
applications.  
environmental 
We  believe 
that  our  hypothesis 
is  especially 
interesting to the automotive domain because efforts are 
underway to apply safety standards from other domains, 
such as IEC61508 [7], ARP 4754 [9], to the automotive 
domain and/or to create special platform and automotive

availability,  integrity,  and  reliability  numbers  and  refer 
readers to known literature such as [8]. A more general 
discussion on dependability and terms used in this paper 
can  be  found  in  [6].  The  actual  numbers  are  of  less 
consequence;  our  intent  is  to  examine  the  relative 
strength  of  different  architectural  polices  in  relation  to 
integrity and availability guarantees.

3. Overview of BRAIN 
is  Möbius 
The  BRAIN  (braided  ring  availability 
integrity 
network) is an alternative topology and guardian (fault-
containment  strategy)  for  ensuring  high-integrity  data 
propagation. A braided ring augments the standard ring 
topology  with  increased  connectivity.  In  addition  to 
neighboring connections, a node is also connected to its 
neighbor’s  neighbor  via  a  link  called  the  braid  or  skip 
link (see Figure 1).  
The BRAIN is a flooding network that minimizes the 
propagation  delay  of  rings.  Each  node  propagates  a 
message in real time, leading to only a few bits delay for 
each hop. As described in detail in [17][18], each node is 
monitored for correct data propagation by the next node 
downstream through bit-for-bit comparison between the 
data  received  on  the  direct  and  the  skip  link.  Data 
corruption is signaled to nodes downstream with special 
integrity fields in the dataflow or indicated via truncation 
(namely  by  stop-forwarding  the  message).  The  action 
depends on the configuration of the ring (full-duplex or 
half-duplex links). Because data flows in two directions, 
each  node  receives  correct  data  despite  any  arbitrary 
failure.  To  tolerate  multiple  faults,  each  end  node 
compares data received from two directions, and accepts

topological  neighbors  based  on  a  synchronized  global 
time  and  TDMA  (Time  Division  Multiple  Access) 
schedule information to ensure medium availability.  
The  propagation  comparison  of  each  node  can  be 
leveraged  to  support  high  integrity  sources,  namely 
message-based self-checking pairs (see [18] for details). 
For  this,  two  neighboring  nodes  of  the  BRAIN  form  a 
pair and  send  their  version  of  the  message  at  the  same 
point  in  time.  The  propagation  logic  performs  the 
comparison as for any other message, and each receiving 
node  receives  a  high-integrity  message  if  both  sources 
(the pair) have sent the same data.

assumptions may need to be revisited, depending on the 
overall  deployment  of  the  by-wire  architecture  and  in 
light  of  recent  development  of  electronics  (e.g.,  aging 
silicon) [21]. Also, model parameters must be refined to 
reflect  precise  components  and  component  reliability 
numbers  and  algorithmic  or  platform  configuration 
specifics;  e.g.  the  reliability  of  the  communication 
component  depends  highly  on  whether  it  is  integrated 
with a complex, high-power compute core or deployed as 
standalone.  Nevertheless,  despite  some  approximations, 
the  given  models  should  show  the  sensitivity  of  the 
models  to  the  parameters  and  produce  an  interesting 
result giving insights into: 
•  sensitivity  of  platform  reliability  and  impact  on 
safety to extended operation after a failure, 
•  sensitivity of the platform to reliability results, 
•  algorithmic and configuration impact, and 
• 
impact of integrity detection mechanisms; the full 
coverage  approach  of  the  BRAIN  compared  to 
inline  integrity  approaches  used  in  alternative 
architectures,  e.g.,  dual  star 
topologies  with 
redundant active central guardians [24][25].

important  for  the  final  safety  assessment;  however,  the 
presented model and parameters evaluate the foundation 
and  present  insights  about  whether  the  foundation  is 
strong enough for application assignments.  
The  model  evaluates  the  reliability  of  the  platform. 
Correct  operation  of  a  platform  constitutes  looking  at 
availability and integrity and their implications to safety. 
Safety from a platform perspective means that either an 
integrity  violation  or 
redundancy  exhaustion  has 
occurred. Integrity violation means that the data has been 
corrupted  during  transmission  or  in  computation.  If 
voting is applied, such data corruptions could be “voted 
out”  at the  application.  If  high-integrity  computing and 
communication end systems are used, data can be used 
immediately without voting. Thus, any corruption of data 
by  the  platform  may  have  severe  consequences.  High-
integrity compute and communication platforms (such as 
AIMS,  aircraft  information  management  systems,  in 
Boeing  777 and  its  communication  backbone  SAFEbus 
[20])  are  very  enabling  due  to  reduction  overhead  of 
traditional  fault  tolerance  schemes  from  voting
