User: Does Apple accept Python applications for distribution on the new Mac App Store?
If so, how should the application be packaged? Is py2app sufficient? Something else?
Assistant: I know it's possible because I know of at least one Python-based app that is in the app store ("Pennywise", which is based on my own app, moneyGuru, which uses Python + PyObjc + py2app). I didn't do it myself, so I'm not sure of the details.
