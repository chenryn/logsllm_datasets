• Tools exist for parsing

GSE (Generic Stream Encapsulation)
• More modern, popular among enterprise “VSAT” customers
• In practice, networks assume equipment in the $25k-$100k range
• Doesn’t work well on our hardware…

Crossing the “Red Line”
”A primary concern is the sharing of these 
SATCOM devices between different data domains, 
which could allow an attacker […] to pivot from a 
compromised IFE to certain avionics”

TCP Session Hijacking
• Snoop TCP sequence 
numbers
• Impersonate satellite-
terminal conversation 
endpoint
• Possibly bi-directional, but 
more complex
• Network Requirements
• IPs must be routable to 
attacker
• No TCP sequence number 
altering proxies

Ethics and Disclosure
Adhered to legal 
obligations in jurisdiction 
of data collection
• Data stored securely 
and only while needed
• Data was never shared 
with 3rd parties
• Encryption untouched
• Won’t “name and 
shame”
Followed responsible 
disclosure process
• Contacted satellite 
operators in 2019
• Reached out to some of 
the largest impacted 
customers
Vast majority of 
companies were 
receptive
• Shared findings directly 
to CISOs of several large 
orgs
• Unclear if any changes 
have been made…
• Only one organization 
threatened legal action 
if we published!

Why Does This Happen?
• Not just ignorance / 
incompetence
• Space is far and round-trip 
times (RTT) to GEO are long
• TCP especially troublesome 
because of the 3-way 
handshake

• Split TCP handshake locally
• One handshake at the modem
• One handshake at the ISP 
groundstation
• Problem: Can’t split TCP 
connections if they’re 
wrapped in a VPN
• Applies to TCP-based VPNs too 
since underlying connection is 
wrapped
