User: I want to configure PyCharm 3.0 to use a Remote Python Interpreter.
The Problem is, I have to connect over a SSH Gateway:
MyMachine -> Gateway -> Machine with Python
When I connect via Cygwin I type the following: ssh -t user@gateway.com "ssh user@machineWithPython.com"
Is there a way to achieve this in PyCharm?
Another question, can I forward the X11 server to PyCharm (so that I can view the matplotlib plots on my machine?)
Regards,
m
Assistant: I was able to the piggyback X11 forwarding through another ssh connection.  Try setting the DISPLAY environment variable in your PyCharm run configuration like so:
DISPLAY=localhost:102
Check the value of DISPLAY in the other connection to see exactly what the value should be.
