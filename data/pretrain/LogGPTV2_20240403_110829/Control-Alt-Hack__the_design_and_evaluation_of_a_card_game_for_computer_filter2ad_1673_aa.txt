ABSTRACT 
We  scoped,  designed,  produced,  and  evaluated  the  effectiveness 
of  a  recreational  tabletop  card  game  created  to  raise  awareness 
of—and  alter  perceptions  regarding—computer  security.  We 
discuss  our  process,  the  challenges  that  arose,  and  the  decisions 
we  made  to  address  those  challenges.  As  of  May  2013,  we  have 
shipped  approximately  800  free  copies  to  150  educators.  We 
analyze and report on feedback from 22 of these educators about 
their  experiences  using  Control-Alt-Hack  with  over  450  students 
in classroom and non-classroom contexts. The responses from the 
14 educators who reported on their use of the game in a classroom 
context  variously  indicated  that:  their  students’  awareness  of 
computer  security  as  a  complex  and  interesting  field  was 
increased  (11/14);  they  would  use  the  game  again  in  their 
classroom (10/14); and they would recommend the game to others 
(13/14).  Of  note,  2  of  the  14  classroom  educators  reported  that 
they would not have otherwise covered the material. Additionally, 
we present results from user studies with 11 individuals and find 
that  their  responses  indicate  that  8  of  the  11  had  an  increased 
awareness  of  computer  security  or  a  changed  perception; 
furthermore,  all  of  our  intended  goals  are  touched  upon  in  their 
responses.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
We  believe  that  there  is  vast  benefit  to  be  offered  from  raising 
people’s  awareness  of  computer  security.  Exposing  many 
different kinds of individuals to ideas that make them think about 
computer  security—however  briefly—could  potentially  benefit 
the status of computer security as whole: 
Current and Future Users. The more people prioritize security, 
the  more  they  might  express  it  with  their  purchasing  power,  and

the more willing they might be to engage in security and privacy 
behaviors that require time or effort. 
Current and Future Developers. The more developers prioritize 
security, the more willing they might be to take action. This might 
mean  taking  security  training,  refreshing  their  knowledge  of  best 
security  practices,  taking  more  care  with  their  code,  or  simply 
thinking to reach out to their institution’s security team.  
Current  and  Future  Management.  If  management  prioritizes 
security,  they  might  dedicate  more  resources  to  developing  and 
maintaining  secure  products  and  systems,  or  reward  security-
promoting behaviors via the institution’s incentive structure. 
Future Technologists. We encourage as many people as possible 
to  consider  computer  security  and  computer  science  as  a 
profession, in order to increase the strength of the field as a whole. 
There  are  many  avenues  to  increase  people’s  awareness  of 
security:  publicity  campaigns,  integration  into  popular  culture, 
and education and training are just a few. In our work, our desire 
to create an artifact that exposes people to thinking about security 
and  that  facilitates  ad  hoc,  social  interactions  led  us  to  design 
Control-Alt-Hack®:  White  Hat  Hacking  for  Fun  and  Profit:  a 
recreational,  tabletop  card  game  about  computer  security.  As  of 
May  2013,  approximately  800  requested  copies  of  Control-Alt-
Hack have been shipped to 150 educators.  
We  sent  these  educators  surveys,  and  22  educators  representing 
over  450  students  submitted  feedback  about  their  experiences 
using  Control-Alt-Hack  inside  and  outside  of  the  classroom. 
Analysis  of  the  evaluation  data  has  indicated  that  we  have  had 
some  success  meeting  our  design  goals.  Of  the  educators  who 
reported  using  the  game  in  their  classrooms:  11  out  of  14 
indicated  in  their  responses  that  the  game  played  a  role  in 
increasing their students’ awareness of computer security; 11 out 
of 14 indicated that the game was engaging or filled a social role 
in  the  classroom;  13  out  of  14  indicated  that  they  would  suggest 
the game to others; and 10 out of 14 said that they would use the 
game in their class again. In terms of reaching new audiences, 2 of 
the  classroom  educators  reported  that  they  would  not  have 
otherwise  covered  the  security  material  in  Control-Alt-Hack. 
Furthermore, in a user study we conducted with 11 participants, 8 
of the 11 provided evidence that they were thinking in new ways 
about computer security after playing the game. 
In this paper, we: 
  Describe  and  explore  the  manner  in  which  unconventional 
tools,  and  specifically  a  physical  game,  can  reach  new 
audiences—or  be  used  in  new  contexts—in  order  to  raise 
overall awareness or alter perceptions about security;

themselves in the field.

opportunities available to people with these skills. 
Exposure  Goal.  We  seek  to  have  as  wide  an  impact  with  our 
Awareness  and  Perception  Goals  as  possible—the  more  people 
that  play  this  game,  the  more  opportunities  our  game  has  to 
increase awareness or change perception.  
2.2  Why a Game? 
We believe that games are well positioned to address our specific 
project  goals.  If  designed  well,  we  argue  that  games  can  be  an 
appropriate  tool  for  seeding  a  large  audience  of  people  with  a 
modest amount of security information. Briefly: 
  Games can be fun, which gets people engaged.

in creating tools that utilize unconventional methods or reach 
new  audiences,  in  order  to  ultimately  improve  the  state  of 
computer security as a whole.  
2.  PROJECT GOALS 
2.1  Goals 
Awareness Goals. As motivated by Section 1, our primary goal is 
to  increase  people’s  awareness  of  computer  security  needs  and 
challenges, so that they can be more informed technology builders 
and consumers. This includes: 
(1)  Increasing  understanding  of  the  importance  of  computer 
security,  and  the  potential  risks  with  inadequate  security 
safeguards.

computing  platforms  like  laptops  and  Web  servers,  but  also 
emerging  platforms  like  pervasive  technologies  and  cyber-
physical systems.

even  fictional  role-models  could  help  encourage  interest  in 
computer  science  and  computer  security.  More  specifically,  we 
aim:

(1)  To  work  against  negative,  dissuasive,  or  niche  stereotypes 
about people in these fields, and to allow players to identify 
questions. 
  Games  are  intended  to  have  intrinsic  entertainment  value, 
which gets people to pick them up and use them on their own 
time. 
Given  the  subject  matter,  it  may  seem  natural  to  have  created  a 
computer  game,  rather  than  a  physical  tabletop  game.  Both 
formats have their merits and their limitations, and in creating our 
tool we chose to explore  the  problem space via a  physical  game. 
Part  of  our reasoning  in  doing  so was to  take  advantage  of some 
of the following factors: 
Physical  games  may  appeal  to  people  who  do  not  enjoy 
computer games. 
  Aside  from  requiring  a  surface  on  which  to  play,  physical 
games  generally  do  not  require  extensive  setup  or  have 
resource dependencies. 
  Having a game lying around in a physical space provides the 
opportunity  to  read  through  some  of  the  cards,  even  if  the 
game is not being actively played.  
While  the  following  properties  are  not  exclusive  to  physical 
games: 
Physical  games  can  create  social  environments,  which  can 
foster interaction and discussion of ideas encountered. 
  Because  physical  games  can  create  interaction  between 
players, they are suitable for use in social gatherings.  
2.3  Target Audience 
No game strongly appeals to everyone. While we sought to make 
our  game  as  broadly  appealing  as  possible  to  raise  security 
awareness  within  a  very  large  audience,  it  is  most  practical  to 
target a specific demographic.  
Primary  Education  Audience.  Our  primary  target  audience  is 
people with an affinity for computer science and engineering but 
without 
requiring  significant  computer  security  education, 
training, or experience. We target in particular those who are early 
in  their  careers,  including  computer  science  and  engineering 
undergraduate  students,  high  school  students,  and 
recent 
graduates.  For  example,  a  high  school  student  in  AP  Computer 
Science  might  play  this  game, as  might  a  recent  hire  in  software 
development,  test,  or  management.  This  goal  means  that  our 
primary  target  audience  is  technically  inclined  and  consists  of 
roughly 15- to 30-year-olds.

3.  GAME DESIGN 
In  this  section  we  give  a  brief,  high-level  tour  of  our  game 
development process. 
3.1  Choosing Game Mechanics 
A game’s “mechanics” includes all numeric and logical elements 
of  the  game  that  contribute  to  game  play;  for  example,  a  game’s 
mechanics might consist of its rules, the number and type of game 
decks, and the numbers or gameplay actions on those cards. It can 
be  challenging  to  design  mechanics  that  lead  to  well-balanced 
games. Variables include: the number of players; the time it takes 
to  learn  the  rules;  the  time  it  takes  to  play;  replay  value; 
cooperative  versus  competitive  paradigms;  the  ability  to  rebound 
from  a  losing  streak;  and  the  variety  of  winning  strategies.  The 
story, flavor text, and art rest on top of the mechanics. 
We  initially  explored  creating  game  mechanics  from  scratch.  
However,  since  we  are  computer  security  researchers  and  not 
experts in  game mechanics, we chose to  license a  system from  a 
pre-existing  game  and  then  create  all  new  game  content.  This 
approach  allowed  us  to  forgo  playtesting  the  mechanics—a 
necessary,  time-consuming  step  to  ensure  game  balance  and 
enjoyment.  We  did  do  playtesting  to  review  our  game  content, 
which we discuss in Section 3.2. 
We  explored  the  rules  and  mechanics  of  a  number  of  games 
available for sale in gaming stores for a game that would support 
our desired design goals. For example, we wanted a game where a 
player took on the role of a character, so that they could identify 
with  someone  in  the  computer  security  field  (Perception  Goals); 
we  immediately  gravitated  towards  games  whose  characters 
featured  a  variety  of  skills,  in  order  to  highlight  the  somewhat 
eclectic  specializations  that  can  help  improve—or  break—a 
system’s  security.  We  also  wanted  a  game  that  would  naturally 
support a variety of textually-heavy scenarios or encounters. 
We  licensed  the  Ninja  Burger  mechanic  from  Steve  Jackson 
Games  [28],  best  known  for  their  Munchkin  card  game  and  the 
GURPS roleplaying system. Ninja Burger met our above criteria, 
and  we  transformed  the  game  into  Control-Alt-Hack:  White  Hat 
Hacking  for  Fun  and  Profit.  Instead  of  delivering  burgers  in  fun 
scenarios  in  the  quest  to  become  the  next  branch  manager,  our 
players  tackle  a  range  of  technically-themed  scenarios  with  the 
goal of becoming the next company CEO.  
3.2  Feedback Process 
We solicited feedback on iterations of the  Control-Alt-Hack card 
deck  to  gather  suggestions  to  improve  the  game  and  assess  its 
ability  to  meet  our  goals.  These  formative  evaluations  took  the 
form  of  playtest  sessions  or  “show  and  tell”  sessions,  and  were 
conducted  with  a  variety  of  parties,  including:  undergraduates  in 
an  introductory  computer  science  course  (n=10);  undergraduates 
involved  in  a  computer  security  competition  (n=5);  graduate 
students  affiliated  with  a  computer  security  lab  (n=8);  graduate 
students (unaffiliated with a security lab) who have an interest in 
gaming  (n=2);  computer  science  professors  (n=2);  a  computer 
science  lecturer  (n=1);  a  former  high  school  teacher  of  computer 
science,  now  an  undergraduate  lecturer  (n=1);  outreach  officers 
(n=3);  and  assorted  non-experts  (n=14).  In  response  to  this 
evaluation feedback, we: changed specific card text, modified art, 
and added new cards to help keep track of gameplay decisions. 
3.3  Brief Overview of Control-Alt-Hack 
The following is the premise of the game: 
You and your fellow players work for Hackers, Inc.: a small, 
elite computer security company of ethical (a.k.a., white hat) 
hackers who perform security audits and provide consultation 
services. Their motto? “You Pay Us to Hack You.” 
Your job is centered around Missions—tasks that require you 
to  apply  your  hacker  skills  (and  a  bit  of  luck)  in  order  to 
succeed.  Use  your  Social  Engineering  and  Network  Ninja
