the SPRT, null hypothesis (H0) indicates that the value of private
information bit is 0 and alternate hypothesis (H1) indicates that the
value of private information bit is 1. Under these definitions of H0
and H1, we preconfigure c0 and c1 (c0 < c1) such that the likelihood
of H0 (resp. H1) acceptance increases if c ≤ c0 (resp. c ≥ c1) holds.
By the definition of the SPRT [7], given a sequence of D1, . . . ,Dj
(j ≥ 1), the log-probability ratio Qj on j samples is given by
Qj = ln
Pr(D1, . . . ,Dj|H1)
Pr(D1, . . . ,Dj|H0)
In the sense that location information provided by android systems
is usually independent of each other, it is reasonable that Dk is
assumed to be independent and identically distributed. Under the
i.i.d. assumption, we define Ej as the number of times that Dk = 1
in the j samples. We also denote α′ (resp. β′) as a false positive rate
(resp. a false negative rate) that is configured by user. If trojan app

If trojan app wants to encode private information bit 1 (resp.
) holds,
the j th sample is revoked from the SPRT and the SPRT proceeds
with new samples. Additionally, the pair of latitude and longitude
(Aj+1,Oj+1) contributing to the jth sample is removed from the ran-
dom location selection process. The rational behind the exclusion of
the jth sample in this case is to prevent private information bit from
being incorrectly encoded. If all of the above three conditions do
not hold, the SPRT goes on with new samples. The above encoding
process is repeatedly applied to a series of private information bits.
During the encoding process, trojan app sends the pairs of lati-
tude and longitude, which are chosen from random location selec-
tion process and are fed into the SPRT, to trojan server.
2.2 Decoding Private Information Bits
Each time receiving the pairs of latitude and longitude from trojan
app, trojan server decodes private information bits by performing
the SPRT on these pairs of latitude and longitude in accordance with
the same configuration parameter values, sampling method, and i.i.d

assumption as used in the encoding process. If Ej ≥ ln 1−β′
holds, the SPRT accepts H1 and thus decoding private information
bit 1 is completed. If Ej ≤ ln β′
holds, the SPRT accepts
H0 and thus decoding private information bit 0 is completed. If all
of the above two conditions do not hold, the SPRT goes on with
new samples.

a simple simulation program to emulate the SPRT-based covert

code/decode a private information bit while (δa ,δo )
is
changed from 0.001 to 0.005.
Figure 3: Average fraction of locations selected for the SPRT
while (δa ,δo ) is changed from 0.001 to 0.005.
As displayed in Figure 1, we perceive that the number of samples
required for a private information bit encoding/decoding is below
5.33 on an average in all five configurations of (δa ,δo ). This means
that a few number of location values are sufficient to encode/decode
a private information bit, leading to fast private information bit
transmission to trojan server and fast private information bit in-
terpretation in trojan server. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, when
δa = δo = 0.003, an average number of generated locations and
an average fraction of selected locations reaches its minimum and
maximum in all five configurations of (δa ,δo ), respectively. We
infer from this observation that the higher fraction of selected lo-
cations contributes to the lower number of generated locations.
Moreover, we also see that an average number of samples for a
private information bit encoding/decoding reaches its minimum
when δa = δo = 0.003. This observation signifies that an increase
in average fraction of selected locations likely leads to a decrease
in average number of samples for a private information bit encod-
ing/decoding.

channel establishment between trojan app and trojan server. Specif-
ically, the latitude and longitude of trojan app are initially set to
35.0 degree north and 127.0 degree east, respectively. These initial
settings represent the latitude and longitude of some area in South
Korea. We select a range value uniformly at random in [0, 0.01].
The next pair of latitude and longitude is computed by adding the
range value to the current pair of latitude and longitude or sub-
tracting it from the current pair of latitude and longitude. Decision
on whether to add or subtract is randomly done. We repeat this
process to generate a series of pairs of latitude and longitude. We
perform random location selection process and the SPRT with each
pair of latitude and longitude.
In simulation program, we set ps = 0.9 and pu = 0.1. We also
configure α′ = β′ = 0.01 and c0 = 0.1 and c1 = 0.9. The number
of private information bits to encode is set to 8 and the value of
each private information bit is randomly determined. In addition,
we have five distinct configurations of δa = δo ranging from 0.001
to 0.005 in an increase of 0.001. We report the average results of
1000 simulation runs.
