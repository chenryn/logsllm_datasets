Worm Scans per Second (log)
(d) TRWRBS vs topo100
(e) TRWRBS vs topo1000
(f) TRWRBS vs topoall
Fig. 6. F- against topo worm: percent of experiments where the worm was not
detected (lower is better performance) by the TRW and TRWRBS detectors with a
topo scanning worm. The topo100 worm uses 100 neighbors before reverting to random
scanning, the topo1000 worm uses 1000 neighbors before reverting to random scanning,
and the topoall worm never uses random scanning.
a large number of scans go to addresses with no host present. The only detectors
that are impacted by this strategy are those detectors that rely on observing
connection failures: TRW and TRWRBS. The RBS, MRW, DSC, and PGD
detectors show identical performance against the topo worm and the random
worm. The pattern of neighbors—whether they can be connected to or not—is
random in both the random and topo worms and thus triggers those algorithms
in the same way.
The TRW detector is unable to detect the topo worm during its topo scanning
phase because of the lack of connection failures. It only detects the worm after
it reverts to random scanning. In the topo100 scenario (Figure 6(a)), this occurs
relatively quickly as it does not take long for the worm to exhaust its list of
100 neighbors. TRW is able to detect the worm at speeds as low as 0.01 scans
per second in all environments. However, in the topo1000 scenario, the list of
neighbors is not exhausted during the one-hour experiment for speeds below 0.5
scans per second and the TRW detector is unable to detect topo worms with
slower scanning rates (Figure 6(a)). In the topoall scenario—where the topo
worm never exhausts its list of neighbors—the TRW detector is never successful
at detecting the worm (Figure 6(c)).
Not only is TRW’s ability to detect the worm compromised, but even in
scenarios where it does detect the worm it is much slower at it. Figures 7
show the latency results for TRW against the topo worm. Because during the
worm’s topo phase none of its scans were detected, the latency results against
the topo100 worm are approximately 100 scans worse than they were for TRW
against the random scanning worm. Similar results can be seen for the topo1000
