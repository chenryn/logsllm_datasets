User: I am having trouble importing Pyperclip in IDLE.
I am running windows 7 (64-bit).
I have Python 3.5.2 Installed on: C:\Python\Python35.
I opened command prompt and initiated the install by typing pip install pyperclip after changing directory to C:\Python\Python35\Scripts. 
It successfully installed Pyperclip-1.5.27. 
I then went to IDLE and typed in import pyperclip but the following error is showing up: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
    import pyperclip
ImportError: No module named 'pyperclip'
I tried to fix this by adding "C:\Python\Python35" to the end of the "Path" variable, in the systems environmental variables.
Assistant: For those working in a venv, make sure that you have pyperclip installed in the directory that your venv is running in. 
Eg. C:\MY_PROJECT\venv\Lib\site-packages should include the pyperclip module. If you don't find it here, have a look at where you installed Python and you'll find it there. 
Eg. C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages
