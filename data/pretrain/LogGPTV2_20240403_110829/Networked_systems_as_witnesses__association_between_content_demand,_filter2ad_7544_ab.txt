### Median Value and Daily Activity Changes

Daily activity changes are compared to the corresponding baseline figure for the same day of the week (e.g., data on a Monday is compared with a baseline Monday). This comparison represents the relative change in percentages compared to the baseline days, rather than the absolute number of visitors. If the activity on a specific day is too low and fails to meet the anonymity threshold set by Google [25], missing values are returned. Increases in residential activity indicate decreased mobility, while other categories, such as workplaces, retail outlets, and public transportation, are more indicative of general mobility.

### Google Community Mobility Reports (CMR) and Mobility Patterns

We use Google CMR to define a metric of mobility patterns, which serves as a proxy for social distancing. This is based on the assumption that when individuals make fewer trips, they physically interact less. This usage aligns with prior work in epidemiology and public health (e.g., [2, 4, 11, 43]).

### CDN Dataset

Our third dataset allows us to observe changes in networked systems' demand during the analysis period. We leverage the vantage point of one of the largest global content delivery networks (CDNs), which receives trillions of requests per day. The dataset aggregates resource demand by the client's AS number and location, covering 17,878 autonomous systems across 3,026 counties in all 50 states in the US. We use the request logs from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, as hourly request counts (e.g., hits) of all combined CDN traffic. These logs accumulate all requests received across the CDN's entire platform, covering all types of protocols and devices. Daily request statistics are aggregated by /24 subnets for IPv4 and /48 subnets for IPv6. Requests are normalized into unit-less Demand Units (DU), where each DU represents 0.001% of global request demand (i.e., 1,000 DU = 1%).

### User Mobility and CDN Demand

We first explore the association between CDN demand and user mobility using data on the demand imposed on the CDN and Google’s Community Mobility Reports (CMR) [32] of mobile users' behavior (§3).

Google’s CMR captures the mobility of users of mobile and handheld devices, presented as a percentage difference from a baseline day before the pandemic outbreak (the median value of a 5-week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020). The data shows how visitor numbers at categorized places change over time compared to pre-pandemic levels. For example, by the end of March 2020, there was a drop of almost 50% in the number of people visiting workplaces, transit stations, and retail. Parks and grocery stores saw a drop of more than 10% [56].

In our analysis, we determine the average mobility across parks, transit, grocery, recreation, and workplace per day to quantify the number of people moving outside their homes. This will allow us to gauge the degree of social distancing. Higher values of mobility would indicate lesser social distancing and vice versa.

The formula for the percentage difference of mobility is:
\[ M_{tj} = \frac{\text{parks}_{tj} + \text{transit}_{tj} + \text{grocery}_{tj} + \text{recreation}_{tj} + \text{workplace}_{tj}}{5} \]
where \( M_{tj} \) is the percentage difference of mobility in county \( j \) on day \( t \).

### Hypothesis and Analysis

We hypothesize that a decrease in user mobility, such as during lockdowns and work-from-home scenarios, will result in an increase in CDN demand. This is because individuals are more likely to rely on the Internet for communication and entertainment due to restrictions on outdoor activities. Conversely, when user mobility increases, we expect to see a decrease in demand.

For this analysis, we normalize CDN demand by calculating the percentage difference of demand with respect to the same baseline period as Google’s CMR reports, using the median value of demand for a 5-week period between January 3 and February 6, 2020.

We employ distance correlation [61] to measure the relationship between network demand and human mobility. Distance correlation measures the dependency between two vectors, including both linear and non-linear associations, and is obtained by dividing their distance covariance by the product of their distance standard deviations. It has several advantages over the classical Pearson correlation coefficient, such as detecting non-linear associations and being applicable to random variables of any dimension.

### Focus on US Counties

We focused our analysis on 20 US counties during April and May 2020, selecting the top 20 counties with the highest population density and Internet penetration according to US Census data [65]. We found a high overlap between the sets of counties with the highest density and the highest Internet penetration.

Table 1 lists the correlations between the percentage difference of mobility and the percentage difference of CDN demand across these counties, in descending order. The results show that changes in CDN demand are positively correlated (moderate and high) with increasing social distancing, with a median correlation of 0.56 and a maximum correlation of 0.74.

We generate graphs for 30-day periods for the months of April and May 2020 to visualize the trends of mobility and demand. Figure 1 highlights four counties: Fulton County in Georgia, Montgomery County in Pennsylvania, Fairfax County in Virginia, and Suffolk County in New York. We inverted the mobility axis to better visualize the alignment of the trends.

Even in the case of Montgomery County, with a 0.39 correlation, the alignment of both curves is apparent, with demand and mobility following closely opposite trends. The timings of the peaks and troughs in both trends are similar. The complete set of graphs is included in Appendix A.1.

| State        | County         | Correlation |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Georgia      | Fulton         | 0.74        |
| Massachusetts| Norfolk        | 0.71        |
| New Jersey   | Bergen         | 0.70        |

| Michigan     | Macomb         | 0.47        |
| New York     | Suffolk        | 0.43        |
| Oregon       | Multnomah      | 0.40        |
| New Jersey   | Hudson         | 0.40        |
| California   | Orange         | 0.39        |
| Pennsylvania | Montgomery     | 0.39        |
| New York     | Nassau         | 0.38        |

**Limitations:** Some limitations of this study result from the datasets we rely on and possible confounders. Google CMR only captures mobility information from users who have access to smartphones and turn on their location settings, so the data may not be representative of the wider population. The CDN demand dataset only captures users' requests for resources hosted by the particular CDN, which again may not be a representative sample of the user population.

### Demand and Infection Cases

In the previous section, we established that CDN demand can be used as a proxy for social distancing. In this section, we explore the relationship between CDN demand and reported COVID-19 cases. Specifically, we analyze whether there is a relationship between CDN demand and cases, to what degree, and the optimal lag of days after which the impact of people’s behavior on the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases is most apparent. We focus our analysis on the US, where the absence of centralized policy and highly variable outbreak mitigation responses challenge efforts at assessing the effectiveness of NPIs.

We model our analysis after Badr et al. [4], who explored the association of mobility patterns and COVID-19 infections from January 1 to April 20, 2020. They used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio per county/day to evaluate how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility (calculated based on aggregated and anonymized cell phone data), affected the rate of new infections in counties in the US.

We examined the relationship of CDN demand to the rate of transmission using the same set of 25 US counties with the highest number of cases by April 16, 2020, according to the JHU CSSE dataset [21]. Five of these 25 counties are also among the 20 counties included in the previous analysis on the relationship between mobility and CDN demand (§4); the counties in both sets are Nassau, Middlesex, Suffolk, Bergen, and Hudson [2].

As in Badr et al. [4], we use daily new cases to derive the growth rate ratio (GR) defined as the logarithmic rate of change (number of newly reported cases) over the previous 3 days relative to the logarithmic rate of change over the previous week. GR for any county \( j \) on day \( t \) is as follows:
\[ \text{GR}_{tj} = \frac{\log(C_{tj}) - \log(C_{t-2,j})}{\log(C_{t-6,j}) - \log(C_{t-7,j})} \]
where \( C_{tj} \) is the number of new cases in county \( j \) on day \( t \). GR is a non-negative value and is defined only when the average number of reported cases per day is greater than one over any period (3-day or 7-day moving averages). It takes a value below 1 if the growth rate during the last 3 days was lower than that of the last week; a value greater than 1 represents a growth rate increase in the last 3 days relative to the last week [66].

### Determining Lag

As part of the analysis, we determine the lag, which is the period separating the beginning of social distancing and the onset of case growth reduction [4]. We do this by finding out when demand affects cases the most using cross-correlation.

We conduct the cross-correlation analysis separately for each county because the lag value depends on several factors, including the incubation period (which can be between 2 to 14 days [37]), the day the subject decides to get tested, and the number of days it takes for the test results to be generated. Rapid tests give results within the hour, while common PCR tests available at the time can take up to 72 hours, and depending on backlogs, up to 7 days. Although testing availability increased during April and May 2020, states still varied substantially in their testing times and eligibility criteria [36], increasing the randomness associated with the return date of test results.

To address this randomness, we use small windows of 15 days within the span of two months, preventing the use of a single lag value for the entire period. We do not claim to have completely eradicated the issue of randomness but aim to provide a more accurate representation.

### Results

We determine four offsets for each of the 25 counties and plot the distribution of these offsets in Figure 2. The distribution of lags, with an average of 10 days, is consistent with the incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, plus the additional time it would take to get the test results [58]. Our mean offset rounds up to the same lag used by other studies when measuring the correlation between mobility and cases [4]. A related study by Badr et al. [4] uses a lag of 11 days.

Using the aforementioned metrics and determined lags, we evaluate the relationship between demand and the rate of new infections in these 25 counties in the US, calculating the distance correlations of GR and CDN demand. Table 2 lists these correlations across the counties, in descending order. The results show that changes in CDN demand are positively correlated (moderate and high) with increasing social distancing, with correlations ranging from 0.58 to 0.83, and an average correlation of 0.71.

We generate line plots that show the trends of GR and demand, with the demand trend shifted during the observation period. Figures 3 highlight four counties: Wayne County in Michigan, Passaic County in New Jersey, and others. The distribution of lags, with a mean of 10.2 (Std Dev = 5.6), is consistent with the incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, plus the additional time it would take to get the test results [58].
