median value. Daily activity changes are compared to the corre-
sponding baseline figure day (i.e., data on a Monday is compared
with a baseline Monday) and thus represent the relative change in
percentages compared to baseline days, not the absolute number
of visitors. Missing values were returned if the activity was too
low upon a specific day and thus failed to achieve the anonymity

threshold set by Google [25]. Increases in residential indicate de-
creased mobility, while the other categories are more indicative of
general mobility as they are related to activity around workplaces,
retail outlets, and the use of public transportation.
We use Google CMR to define a metric of mobility patterns
which we use as a proxy for social distancing. This is done on the
basis of the assumption that when individuals make fewer trips,
they physically interact less. This usage aligns with prior work on
epidemiology and public health (e.g., [2, 4, 11, 43]).
3.3 CDN Dataset
Our third dataset lets us observe changes in networked systems’
demand during the period of analysis. For this, we leverage the
vantage point of one of the largest worldwide content delivery
networks, which receives trillions of requests per day, and use
their resource demand aggregated by the client’s AS number and
location. The dataset combines the view from 17,878 autonomous
systems across 3,026 counties in all 50 states in the US. We utilize
the request logs of the CDN from January 1, 2020, to December 31,
2020, as hourly request counts (e.g. hits) of all combined CDN traffic.
These logs accumulate all requests received across the CDN’s entire
platform, covering all types of protocols and devices. To generate
this, all daily request statistics are aggregated by /24 subnets for
IPv4 and /48 subnets for IPv6. These requests are normalized across
the platform into unit-less Demand Units (DU). Demand Units are
normalized out of 100,000, with each DU representing 0.001% of
global request demand (i.e. 1,000DU = 1%).
4 USER MOBILITY AND CDN DEMAND
We first explore the association between CDN demand and user
mobility leveraging data on demand users impose on the CDN and
tbe Google’s Community Mobility Reports [32] of mobile users’
behavior (§3).
Google’s CMR captures the mobility of users of mobile and hand-
held devices. The data is presented as a percentage difference value
from a baseline day before the pandemic outbreak (the median
value of a 5 week period from January 3 - February 6, 2020) for
the different categories of locations. Hence, the data is meant to
show how the visitors mapping to categorized places change over
time as compared to pre-pandemic. For instance, the end of March
2020 sees a drop of almost 50% in the number of people visiting
workplaces, transit stations, and retail. Whereas, parks, and grocery
stores see a drop of more than 10% [56].
In our analysis, we determine the average mobility across parks,
transit, grocery, recreation, and workplace per day to quantify the
number of people moving outside their house (residence). This in
turn will allow us to gauge the degree of social distancing. Higher
values of mobility would mean lesser social distancing and vice
versa.

Our goal is to determine whether demand on a content delivery
network (CDN) - CDN demand - can be used as a proxy for the
social distancing behavior of communities.
We hypothesize that a decrease in user mobility from people
staying at homes such as in the case of lockdowns and work-from-
home, will result in an increase in demand. This may be because
those users are more likely to rely on the Internet more, for the pur-
poses of communication, or entertainment because of restrictions
on other outdoor activities. Whereas, when user mobility increases
and people get out of the house more, we expect to see a decrease
in demand.
For this analysis, we normalize CDN demand by calculating the
percentage difference of demand with respect to the same baseline
period as Google’s CMR reports, using in this case the median value
of demand for a 5 week period between January 3 and February 6,
2020.
We employ distance correlation [61] to measure how well net-
work demand witnesses human mobility and the spread of the
pandemic. Distance correlation measures the dependency between
two vectors, including both linear and non-linear association, and
is obtained by dividing their distance covariance by the product
of their distance standard deviations. Distance correlation has a
number of advantages over classical Pearson correlation coefficient
as it can detect nonlinear associations that are undetectable by
Pearson correlation, it is applicable to random variables of any di-
mension, and it is zero if and only if the variables are independent.
Given the non-linearity of the change in mobility and network de-
mand, distance correlation is a better choice than classical Pearson
correlation for this analysis.
We focused our analysis in 20 US counties during the months of
April and May 2020. We concentrated on the top 20 counties with
the highest population density and Internet penetration according
to the US Census data [65]. To select this set, we started with the top
100 counties with highest density and the top 100 with the highest
Internet penetration and selected those with highest population
density if they are among the highest Internet penetration counties.
We found, perhaps not surprisingly, a high overlap between the
two sets.
Table 1 lists the correlation between percentage difference of
mobility and percentage difference of CDN demand across these
counties, in descending order. The results show that changes in
CDN demand are positively correlated (moderate and high) with
increasing social distancing with a median correlation of 0.56 and
a maximum correlation of 0.74.
We generate graphs for 30-day periods for the months of April
and May 2020 to visualize the trends of mobility and demand. Fig-
ure 1 highlights four counties, Fulton County in Georgia, Mont-
gomery County in Pennsylvania, Fairfax County in Virginia, and
Suffolk County in New York (in bold in Table 1). We inverted the
mobility axis to better visualize the alignment of the trends.
Even in the case of Montgomery County, with 0.39 correlation,
the alignment of both curves is apparent with demand and mobility
following closely opposite trends. The timings of the peaks and

Limitations. Some of the limitations of this part of our study re-
sult from the datasets we rely on and possible confounders. Google
CMR only captures mobility information from users who have
access to smartphones and turn on their location settings, so the
data is a sample of Google Maps users which may or not be repre-
sentative of the wider population. The CDN demand dataset only
captures users’ requests for resources hosted by the particular CDN
we rely on which. again, may not be a representative sample of the
user population.
5 DEMAND AND INFECTION CASES
In the previous section, we established that CDN demand can be
used as a proxy for social distancing. In this section we explore
the relationship between CDN demand and COVID-19 reported
cases. More specifically, we analyze whether there is a relationship
between CDN demand and cases, to what degree, and the optimum
lag of days after which the impact of people’s behavior on the
rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases is most apparent. We focus our
analysis on the US, where the absence of centralized policy and
highly variable outbreak mitigation responses challenges efforts at
assessing the effectiveness of NPIs.

We model our analysis in this section after Badr et al. [4] where
the authors explore the association of mobility patterns and COVID-
19 infections from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020. They used epidemiological
data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio per county/day
to evaluate how social distancing, measured by the relative change
in mobility (calculated based on aggregated and anonymized cell
phone data), affected the rate of new infections in counties in the
US.
We examined the relationship of CDN demand to the rate of
transmission using the same set of 25 US counties with the highest
number of cases by April 16, 2020, according to the JHU CSSE
dataset [21]. We note that five of these 25 counties are also among
the 20 counties included in the previous analysis on the relationship
between mobility and CDN demand (§4); the counties in both sets
are Nassau, Middlesex, Suffolk, Bergen, and Hudson.2
As in Badr et al. [4], we use daily new cases to derive growth rate
ratio (GR) [4] defined as the logarithmic rate of change (number
of newly reported cases) over the previous 3 days relative to the
logarithmic rate of change over the previous week. GR for any
county j on day t is as follows:
log(t
log(t
GRt
j =
C t
j
3 )
7 )
t−2
t−6
C t
j
j is the number of new cases in county j on a day t
where Ct
GR is a non-negative value and is defined only when the average
number of reported cases per day is greater than one over any
period (3-day or 7-day moving averages). It takes a value below 1 if
the growth rate during the last 3 days was lower than that of the
last week; a value greater than 1 represents a growth rate increase
in the last 3 days relative to the last week [66].
Determining Lag. As part of the analysis we determine the lag
which is the period separating the beginning of social distancing
and onset of case growth reduction [4]. We do this by finding out
when demand affects cases the most using cross-correlation.
We conduct the cross-correlation analysis separately for each
county because the lag value is dependent on a number of factors.
These include the incubation period (the period between exposure
to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms) which can
be between 2 to 14 days [37], the day the subject decides to get tested,
and the number of days it takes for the test results to be generated.
A rapid test gives results within the hour where a common PCR-test
available at the time can take 72hrs and, depending on the backlogs,
up to 7 days. Although during April and May 2020, the availability
of testing across the US become high, states still varied substantially
in their testing times and eligibility criteria for tests [36], thereby
increasing the randomness associated with the return date of test
results.
We further cater to the randomness associated with the lags by
taking small windows of 15 days in the span of two months. This
prevents us from using a single value of lag for the duration of two
whole months. It should be noted here that we are not claiming that
we were able to completely eradicate the issue of the randomness
2The overall distance correlation between mobility and CDN demand of these 25
counties is slightly lower than that of the 20 counties with highest population density
and Internet penetration used in the previous section, ranging between 0.14 and 0.67.

trend back by days within the range of 0 and 20 and see which
lag gives the best negative Pearson correlation. We use Pearson
correlation for this purpose because it gives us both positive and
negative values, and we want a lag that gives a negative correlation
depicting opposing trends of GR and demand.
We determine four offsets for each of the 25 counties and plot
the distribution of these offsets in Figure 2. The distribution of lags
with an average of 10 days, is consistent with the incubation period
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, plus the additional time it would take to
get the test results [58]. Furthermore, our mean offset rounds up
to the same lag as used by other studies when they measure the
correlation between mobility and cases [4]. A related study by Badr
et al. [4] uses a lag of 11 when determining the correlation between
mobility and GR of infection cases.
Demand and Infection. Using the aforementioned metrics and
the determined lags, we evaluate if and how well demand affects
the rate of new infections in these 25 counties in the US, calculating
the distance correlations of GR and CDN demand. Table 2 lists these
correlations across the counties, in descending order. The results
show that changes in CDN demand are positively correlated (mod-
erate and high) with increasing social distancing with correlation
ranging from 0.58 to 0.83, with an average correlation of 0.71.
We generate lineplots that show the trends of GR and demand
with the demand trend shifted during the observation period. Fig-
