### Throughput Analysis and Rate-Limiting Detection

#### Figure 2: CDF of Measured Throughput Distribution
- **Throughput of 1MB+ Flows (normalized)**
- **Partially rate-limited**
- **Non-rate-limited**
- **0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4**

**Figure 2** shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the measured throughput for 1MB+ flows from:
- All flows
- An application or content provider that is rate-capped
- One that is partially rate-limited
- One that is not rate-capped or partially rate-limited

#### Identifying Suitable Flow Sizes
The goal is to find a flow size that allows most flows to exit the slow-start phase. **Figure 1** indicates that the median measured throughput of non-rate-limited flow records stabilizes at about 1MB. We describe the method for identifying rate-limited flows in Section 3.2.

#### Algorithm for Estimating Max-Throughput
The next logical step is to apply a summary function over the byte/duration values in all flow records with total bytes â‰¥ 1MB, which we term as 1MB+ flows. However, this approach is insufficient because the measured throughput of identically sized large flows can still vary based on the application protocol and content provider. For example, **Figure 2** illustrates the distribution of measured throughput values for 1MB+ flows across different (application, content-provider) types.

**Note:** In a wireless network, TCP may exit slow start due to physical layer loss rather than congestion-induced loss. The throughput in **Figure 1** continues to increase linearly at a slow rate even after the knee in the curve, indicating that TCP AIMD sometimes finds more capacity available after slow-start. Since our goal is to estimate the maximum throughput that real users experience, we do not exclude the effects of physical layer loss.

#### Figure 3: Histogram of 95th Percentile Throughput
**Figure 3** shows the histogram of the 95th percentile of throughput from each application, content provider, and (application, content-provider) flow type, respectively.

- **Rate-capped** types are bottlenecked by the content provider, as none of their flows achieve higher throughputs.
- **Non-rate-limited** types achieve throughput values throughout the possible spectrum.
- **Partially rate-limited** types exhibit bimodal behavior: some flows are rate-limited (0-40%), while others are not (40-100%). This can occur when the same application protocol is used for control messages and bulk transfer.

Most flow types fall into one of these three categories, including application protocols used only for control messages, which appear to be rate-capped at very low throughput values.

#### Causes of Rate-Limiting
A flow can appear to be rate-limited for various reasons, such as traffic shaping by the content provider, application protocol bottlenecks, and persistent congestion or capacity problems on the Internet path to the server. In practice, we need to detect the effect on the throughput distribution rather than the cause.

### 3.2 Identifying Rate-Limited Flows
To obtain a more accurate measure of max-throughput, we must filter out applications and content providers with flow distributions similar to rate-capped and partially rate-limited types.

- **Rate-capped flow type**: Never reaches the available network capacity.
- **Partially rate-limited flow type**: Has a significant fraction of rate-limited flows.

#### Heuristics for Detection
1. **Rate-Capped Flows**:
   - The rate-capped flow distribution never crosses the tail of the all flows distribution.
   - If at least 5% of all 1MB+ flows reach the available capacity, a non-rate-capped flow type should have a 95th percentile throughput at least as large as the 95th percentile throughput of all 1MB+ flows.
   - **Figure 3** shows a histogram of the 95th percentile of each flow type, defined by application, content provider, and (application, content-provider) pair. Only flow types with at least 100 flows are presented.
   - Content-provider and (application, content-provider) distributions show a clear mode to the right of the "95th percentile of all 1MB+ flows" line, representing non-rate-capped flows. Application distributions do not exhibit this mode, suggesting rate-capping is primarily a property of content providers, not application protocols.

2. **Partially Rate-Limited Flows**:
   - The partially rate-limited flow distribution is bimodal: the first portion has a very steep slope due to rate-limiting, while the later portion is less steep.
   - We use the following heuristic: Let \( s_i \) and \( s_{i+5} \) be the slopes at percentiles \( i \) and \( i + 5 \), respectively. The slope ratio is \( s_i / s_{i+5} \). The maximum slope ratio is the greatest slope ratio over \( i \in [7, 8, 9, \ldots, 93] \).
   - **Figure 4** shows a histogram of the maximum slope ratio over each (application, content-provider) flow type. Only flow types with at least 100 flow records are presented.
   - A primary mode to the left of the line at maximum slope ratio = 5 represents flow types without dramatic changes in slope. A long tail to the right of this line identifies partially rate-limited flows. The threshold of 5 conservatively captures most flow types in the main mode.

### 3.3 Our Approach: A Throughput Index
To better estimate max-throughput, our approach includes only flow types that are non-rate-capped and non-rate-limited. We call this set the **Throughput Index (TI)**.

**Table 1** shows the top 15 (application, content-provider) flow types by number of 1MB+ flows, whether they are identified as rate-capped (C) and/or partially rate-limited (L), and their mean and median throughputs. Bold entries are included in the TI.

- Mean and median throughputs of TI flow types are closer to each other than non-TI flow types, as expected of unconstrained vs. constrained downloads.
- Some anomalies exist, but modifying thresholds slightly does not dramatically change the fraction of rate-capped or partially rate-limited flow types.

**Table 2** shows the percentage of flows and (application, content-provider) types in each flow type category. Surprisingly, nearly 60% of large flows are rate-capped and can never reach peak network capacity. The TI includes 39% of flows and 23% of flow types.

In practice, we compute the TI offline based on a representative time period of flow records. Once computed, we process flows online using the TI as a filter to select flows for max-throughput estimates. We recompute the TI every few months as the distributions of popular (application, content-provider) types do not change often.

### Aggregating Byte/Duration Measurements
We evaluate two approaches for aggregating byte/duration measurements of flows in the TI:
1. **TI-F**: Takes a mean over the throughputs of all flow records in the TI. This is robust to outlier users but sensitive to non-network problems affecting the top 3 content providers.
2. **TI-T**: Takes the mean of the means of each flow type. This is more robust to unexpected changes with individual content providers but more sensitive to unpopular flow types.

### 4. Evaluation
Evaluating the accuracy of any max-throughput estimation technique is challenging due to the lack of ground truth measurements. We compare our passive max-throughput estimation techniques with active measurements. The TI estimates of max-throughput are closer to these active measurements than alternative passive measurement techniques, suggesting that the TI estimates are more representative of max-throughput.

#### 4.1 Setup
We compare our passive max-throughput estimation techniques against active measurements in several 3G wireless network regions, each covering a major metropolitan area.
