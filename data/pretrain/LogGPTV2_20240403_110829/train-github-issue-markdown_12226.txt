## Summary
When `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` is set to `True`, the `Crawl-delay:` directive specified in the `robots.txt` file is not taken into account.

## Motivation
Our goal is to fully comply with the requirements outlined in the `robots.txt` file, including any specified crawl delays.

## Workaround
Manually review the `robots.txt` file and check for any `Crawl-delay:` directives. Adjust the crawler's settings accordingly to ensure compliance.
