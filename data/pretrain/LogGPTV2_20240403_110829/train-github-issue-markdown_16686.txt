Subject: Suggestion for Improving PowerToys Shortcut Functionality

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I have noticed that, occasionally, the shortcuts in PowerToys fail to function correctly. I suspect this issue may arise when the 'Settings' window is closed, potentially leading to the unintended termination of the application.

To address this, I propose a minor but impactful enhancement: instead of fully closing, PowerToys should minimize to the System Tray whenever the 'Settings' window is closed. This change would not only maintain the active state of the application but also ensure that all shortcuts remain functional at all times, thereby enhancing user experience and productivity.

Thank you for considering my suggestion. I look forward to any updates or feedback regarding this matter.

Best regards,
