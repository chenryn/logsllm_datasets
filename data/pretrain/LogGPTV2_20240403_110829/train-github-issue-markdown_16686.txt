Hi, sometimes the shortcuts for PowerToys do not work - I doubt this is
because we close the 'Settings' window of PowerToys. So instead of closing the
app, I think it would be good if the app minimizes itself to the System Tray.
I think this minor tweak will be a value addition to PowerToys. Thanks!
