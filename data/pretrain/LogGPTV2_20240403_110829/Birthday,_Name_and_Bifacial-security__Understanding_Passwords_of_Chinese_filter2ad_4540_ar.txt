information into passwords [9, 56], such dates are likely
to be users’ birthdays. Besides, about 30.89% of Chinese
speaking users use a 4+-digit date to create passwords,
which is 3.59 times higher than that of English speaking
users (i.e. 8.61%). Also, there are 13.49% of Chinese
users inserting a four-digit year into their passwords,
which is 3.55 times higher than that of English speaking
users (3.80%, which is comparable to the results in [14]).
We note that there might be some overestimates, for
there is no way to deﬁnitely tell apart whether some digit
sequences are dates or not, e.g., 010101 and 520520.
These two sequences may be dates, yet they are also
likely to be of other semantic meanings (e.g., 520520
sounds like “I love you I love you”). As discussed later,
we have devised reasonable ways to address this issue. In
all, dates play a vital role in passwords of Chinese users.
We mainly pay attention to length-4, 6 and 8 digits
in passwords, because: 1) Length-4 and 6 are the most
widely used lengths of PINs in the West and Asia; and 2)
6&8 are the two most frequent password lengths (see Fig.
2). It is interesting to see that 2.91% of Chinese users are
likely to use their 11-digit mobile numbers as passwords,
making up 39.59% of all passwords with an 11+-digit
substring. On average, 12.39% of Chinese passwords
are longer than 11. Thus, if an attacker can determine
(e.g., by shoulder-surﬁng) that the victim uses a long
password, she is likely to succeed with a high chance
of 23.48%(= 2.91%
12.39%) by just trying the victim’s 11-
digit mobile number. This reveals a practical attacking
strategy against long Chinese passwords.
Note that there are some unavoidable ambiguities
when determining whether a text/digit sequence belongs
to a speciﬁc dictionary, and an improper resolution of
these ambiguities would lead to an overestimation or
underestimation.
Here we take “YYMMDD” for
illustration. For example, both 111111 and 520521 fall
into “YYMMDD” and are highly popular. However, it is
more likely that users choose them simply because they
are easily memorable repetition numbers or meaningful
strings, and counting them as dates would lead to an
overestimation. Yet
they can really be dates (e.g.,
111111 stands for “Nov. 11th, 2011” and 520131 for
“Jan 31th, 1952”) and completely excluding them from
“YYMMDD” would lead to underestimation of dates.
Thus, we assume that user birthdays are randomly
distributed and assign the expectation of the frequency of
dates (denoted by E), instead of zero, to the frequency of
these abnormal dates. We manually identify 17 abnormal
dates in the dictionary “YYMMDD”, each of which
originally has a frequency> 10E and appears in every
top-1000 list of the six Chinese datasets. In this way, the
ambiguities can be largely resolved. We similarly tackle
16 abnormal items in “MMDD”. The detailed info about
these abnormal dates can be found in Appendix B. As for
the other 19 dictionaries in Table 5, few abnormal items
can be identiﬁed, and they are processed as usual.
Summary. We have measured nine password datasets in
terms of letter distribution, length distribution, frequency

distribution and semantic patterns. To our knowledge,
most of these fundamental characteristics have at most
been mentioned/exampled in the literature (see [26, 30,
34, 36, 53]) but never systematically examined. We have
identiﬁed a number of similarities (e.g., frequency distri-
bution and the theme of love) and differences (e.g., letter
distribution, structural patterns, and semantic patterns)
between passwords of these two user groups.
