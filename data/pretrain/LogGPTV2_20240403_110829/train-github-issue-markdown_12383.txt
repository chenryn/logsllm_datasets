Would it make sense to define `Base.iterate(::Nothing) = nothing` ?
HTTP.jl has a generic interface that accepts anything iterable.  
A user has reported `method matching iterate(::Nothing)` when they passed
`nothing`.
It seems that `eltype` is already defined.
    julia> eltype(nothing)
    Any
But, `HasEltype`, `HasShape` and `HasLength` are not.
