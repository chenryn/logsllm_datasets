Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Stationary
B: Periodic
C: Unable to determine
D: Sparse

Assistant: Answer: B

Explanation: According to the analysis, the time series in the question exhibits a pattern of periodic increase followed by a decrease. Therefore, it can be considered as cyclic type data. Hence, selecting option B is correct.
