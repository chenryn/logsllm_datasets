Appendix E] and add noise multiple times and not per group. While
their server communication is more efficient than ours (requiring
only kilobytes), we have similar client communication (kilobytes),
however, their computation time is linear in the number of parties.
PEM is linear in the domain bit-length and asymptotically faster
than Boneh et al. [20]. Adjusted for 𝑘 = 256, 𝑏 = 256, PEM is faster
than their approach for more than 6 million clients6.
Naor et al. [65] consider DP collection of frequently used pass-
words with malicious parties. On a very high-level, their hash-then-
match approach is similar to PEMorig with 𝑛2𝑙 server operations,
albeit more efficient ones (no hashing): Each user 𝑗 receives a ran-
dom 𝑙-bit value 𝑟 𝑗 from the server, computes 𝑙-bit hash ℎ 𝑗 of her
password and reports one bit, the inner product of 𝑟 𝑗 and GRR(ℎ 𝑗)
over 𝐺𝐹 [2]. The server keeps 2𝑙 counters, tries to find a match-
ing 𝑥 ∈ 2𝑙 for every report and increments the corresponding
counters. Hash values are released if their noisy counts exceed a
fixed fraction of the user count. Almost an LDP protocol, with the
same accuracy limitations, where secure computation is required
as malicious users cannot learn 𝑟 𝑗. Their protocol is a series of
two-party computations between users and server, whereas our
protocol is a multi-party computation, where users can outsource
the computation and only need to secret share their inputs.
7 CONCLUSION
We presented protocols for federated, differentially private top-𝑘
discovery with secure multi-party computation. Our central DP
approaches, HH and PEM, provide higher accuracy than local DP
methods for small number of users, without a trusted third party
due to our use of cryptography. HH, based on non-private heavy
hitter discovery in data streams [27], has a running time liner in
the data size but supports unknown domains, and provides better
accuracy than PEM for very small data sizes, where local DP meth-
ods cannot provide meaningful accuracy. PEM, based on Wang et
al. [78], iteratively finds and extends frequent prefixes, is linear in
the bit-length of the data domain, and provides better accuracy than
HH for larger data sizes. We implemented our protocols with two
MPC frameworks [4, 53], compared them, and achieved practical
running times of less than 11 minutes in a real-world WAN. Future
work for MPC sketching might reduce reconstruction overhead by
combining multiple sketches (at the cost of increased communica-
tion). Also, one might leverage public data like Li et al. [58] and
consider adaptive composition [31] instead of parallel composition.

6 Boneh et al. [20, Table 9] process ≈120 clients/second (on 32 vCPUs, 60 GB RAM,
≈62 ms WAN delay, 𝑏 = 256 and 𝑘 as 0.1% of number of clients). PEM runs in less
than 12 minutes in total (on 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM with 100 ms delay, 𝑏 = 64, 𝑘 = 16)
and is independent of client count 𝑛, but linear in 𝑘 and 𝑏. PEM’s time multiplied by
256/16 (adjusts 𝑘), 256/64 (𝑏), and 120 clients/s, results in ≈ 5.6 million clients.
