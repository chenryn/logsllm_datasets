**Current behavior**  
When rejecting access to a component in a path using Guards you currently have
to redirect to another path otherwise you get a blank page. This is for rc.4
new router.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
It would be useful to be able to render a rejection page such as a 403 and not
require a redirect or be able to provide a component for rejection.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
If the current behavior is a bug or you can illustrate your feature request
better with an example, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible
a minimal demo of the problem via https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use
