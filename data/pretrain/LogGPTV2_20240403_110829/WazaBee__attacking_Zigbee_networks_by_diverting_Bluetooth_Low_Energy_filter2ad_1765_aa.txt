Abstract—This paper discusses the security of wireless commu-
nication protocols of the Internet of Things (IoT) and presents
a new attack targeting these protocols, called WazaBee, which
could have a critical impact and be difﬁcult to detect. Speciﬁcally,
WazaBee is a pivotal attack aimed at hijacking BLE devices,
commonly used in IoT networks,
in order to communicate
with and possibly attack through a different wireless network
technology, considering protocols based on 802.15.4, in particular
Zigbee. We present the key principles of the attack and describe
some real-world experiments that allowed us to demonstrate its
practical feasibility. The attack takes advantage of the compati-
bility that exists between the two modulation techniques used by
these two protocols. Finally, the paper brieﬂy discusses possible
countermeasures to mitigate the impact of this attack.
I. INTRODUCTION
The massive and fast deployment of IoT devices raises
major security concerns. Indeed, several wireless protocols de-
signed to meet the requirements of the connected objects (low
power consumption and low complexity protocol stacks) have
been deployed in the recent years. Some of these protocols,
such as Zigbee, BLE or Thread, are becoming widespread in
IoT networks, and their vulnerabilities are actively studied,
while other proprietary protocols are seldom analysed because
their speciﬁcations are not available.
It is generally difﬁcult to analyse security and to implement
efﬁcient protection mechanisms in IoT environments, mostly
due to some speciﬁc characteristics of such environments, het-
erogeneity, decentralisation and dynamicity, which are difﬁcult
to handle from the security point of view.
This situation is problematic because it dramatically in-
creases the attack surface exposed by IoT environments, and
opens the opportunity to attackers to set up novel offensive
strategies that are difﬁcult
to anticipate from a defensive
point of view. Several vulnerabilities and attack scenarios
have already been discovered in several widely used wireless
protocols, like [1], [2], [3] or [4]. However, these studies
generally focus on a single wireless technology.
In this paper, we focus on a speciﬁc threat that has been
seldom studied from an offensive perspective until now. It
takes advantage of the co-existence in the same environment of
multiple wireless technologies. We investigate the possibility
to divert the behaviour of a given device dedicated to a speciﬁc
radio protocol, to make it communicate through another radio
protocol not initially supported by the device, in order to
perform malicious activities. The feasibility of such commu-
nications between heterogeneous protocols, has been explored
in some previous works, commonly called Cross Technology
Communications. However, existing solutions always assume
a cooperation from the surrounding devices to allow such a
transmission. This assumption is not realistic from an offensive
perspective, which makes such attacks very unlikely. The
approach investigated in this paper does not rely on this
assumption, thus increasing its practical feasibility. Speciﬁ-
cally, the proposed approach, called pivoting attack, allows to
establish a communication channel between chips supporting
BLE, which are embedded in many smart devices, and IEEE
802.15.4 protocols such as Zigbee, in order to perform various
types of attacks. The ubiquity and wide deployment of BLE
devices make these attacks critical as the attack surface of
Zigbee networks is signiﬁcantly increased.
We believe the consequences of such pivoting attacks,
would be critical, because 1) they open the possibility of new
offensive strategies quite difﬁcult to detect, because not con-
sidered as for now, and 2) they can be deployed at a large scale
because the vast majority of connected objects embed at least
one radio technology, that could possibly be remotely diverted.
Furthermore, they exploit the use of BLE chips that are widely
deployed in many environments, because they are embedded
in the BLE-connected smartphones and smart devices. This
makes the threat stealthier than attacks based on Software
Deﬁned Radios (SDR) which require bringing speciﬁc and
detectable malicious devices inside the environment.
As an example, such a strategy can be used to perform
covert channel attacks or to exﬁltrate data to an illegitimate
remote receiver by means of a corrupted BLE object, by
communicating through a wireless protocol that is not sup-
posed to be monitored in the targeted environment. It can
also be used to perform traditional attacks targeting a radio
protocol RP1 (man in the middle, snifﬁng, spooﬁng, etc) from
a device supporting another radio protocol RP2 and that is not
considered as a potential source of attack for the RP1 protocol.
The main objective of this paper is to show the feasibility of
such a novel attack strategy, called WazaBee, by considering
the speciﬁc case of BLE and 802.15.4-based (e.g. Zigbee)
protocols. The main motivation is to increase awareness about
the need to develop efﬁcient protection mechanisms to prevent
and mitigate this type of attack which could have critical
consequences on the security of IoT environments. The attack
takes advantage of some characteristics of the BLE protocol
to allow some BLE devices to communicate using 802.15.4-
based protocols not initially supported by these devices.
The consequences of this attack are critical because the
vulnerability is not speciﬁc to some BLE chips but is rather re-
lated to the design and implementation of the underlying radio
protocols. As a consequence, the attack is not implementation
dependent and may potentially be used with the majority of
BLE chips. In addition, the attack can be implemented easily
which increases the level of the threat.
The contribution is threefold:
• We present the theoretical foundations of a novel pivoting
attack, WazaBee, by demonstrating the compatibility that
exists between the two modulation techniques used by
BLE and 802.15.4-based protocols and how it is possible
to take advantage of this compatibility to carry out various
critical attacks.
• We demonstrate its practical feasibility by implementing
it on two different chips supporting the BLE protocol,
and evaluate its performance in a realistic environment.
• We describe the implementation of two realistic attack
scenarios exploring the feasibility of exploiting this attack
in practice, from several heterogeneous hardware devices
and under various assumptions.
The paper is organised as follows. Section II describes some
related works allowing to implement pivoting attacks targeting
wireless devices. Section III presents the physical layers of
BLE and 802.15.4-based protocols. Section IV outlines the
theoretical basis of WazaBee attack, and also underlines some
requirements related to the BLE protocol stack and how they
may be addressed to implement the attack. Section V describes
a practical implementation of WazaBee on two different chips
and the associated benchmarks. Section VI presents two attack
scenarios that we actually conducted in order to illustrate the
impact of this attack. Section VII proposes several mitigations
to this attack, and ﬁnally, the conclusion and future work are
presented in section VIII.
II. RELATED WORK
This section brieﬂy presents different attack strategies to
carry out a pivoting attack. Firstly, the case of IoT devices
supporting multiple radio protocols is discussed,
then an
overview of the few existing research works that considered
such an attack on a device supporting a single speciﬁc radio
protocol is presented.
A. Multi-protocol devices
A pivoting attack aims at taking advantage of the coexis-
tence of multiple protocols in the same environment in order
to compromise new objects. The most natural approach for
this attack is to compromise an object supporting multiple
radio communication protocols, allowing to perform the attack
using the provided API. As an example, in [5], Bachy et
al. compromise a smart-TV using HbbTV communication
protocol, then use it to reconﬁgure the ﬁrewall embedded in
the ADSL box using LAN protocols (Ethernet or WiFi).
Several hardware devices allow such attacks to be car-
ried out. For instance, Software Deﬁned Radio devices are
designed for a generic purpose, allowing communications
through multiple protocols, regardless of their modulation and
frequency bands. However, so far, these devices are only used
for prototyping and experimentation purposes.
There are also chips that integrate different wireless devices.
For example, B-L475E-IOT01A [6], based on the STM32L4
micro controller intended for IoT devices, supports multiple
wireless protocols (such as Bluetooth, WiFi or NFC). Similarly,
the CC2652R [7] from Texas Instruments is compliant to mul-
tiple radio technologies in the ISM band. The compromise of
such a chip greatly facilitates the implementation of a pivoting
attack targeting one of the wireless protocols supported by the
chip. However, such chips are expensive and their use is quite
speciﬁc, which limits their deployment in IoT networks.
B. Single-protocol devices
Since most connected objects only embed one wireless
device, the practical implementation of a pivoting attack is
much more complex. We are not aware of existing research
speciﬁcally addressing this issue from an offensive perspective.
However, some contributions explored related topics. The
most relevant contributions are related to Cross-Technology
Communications (CTC) solutions, that are aimed providing a
communication system between two single-protocol devices
supporting heterogeneous wireless communication protocols.
However, to our knowledge these contributions did not inves-
tigate the use of this technology in security or in an offensive
perspective. There are two main categories of CTC, named
Packet-level CTC and Physical layer CTC.
The Packet-level CTC approach relies on some information
linked to the packets. As an example, K. Chebrolu et al. use
packet duration in order to transmit data [8], while the Free-
Bee [9] approach by S. Min Kim is based on the time interval
between beacon frames. From an offensive perspective, these
approaches could be interesting to exﬁltrate some data, but
they are not relevant for pivoting attacks. Other limitations,
such as a low data throughput, are inherent to these approaches
and hamper their practical use.
Physical
layer CTC approaches consist
in emulating a
technology using the signal generated by another one. As an
example, Z. Li et al. simulate a Zigbee frame using a WiFi
transceiver [10]. Similarly, W. Jiang et al. have presented an
approach named BlueBee [11], allowing to simulate Zigbee
frames using a BLE transceiver, and another approach called
XBee [12], enabling to receive Zigbee frames from a BLE
receiver. However, these solutions have major limitations that
prevent their use in an offensive perspective. As an example,
the selection of a Zigbee channel by BlueBee is based on
the channel hopping algorithm of BLE connected mode, so
it requires to establish a BLE connection with another BLE
device. Similarly, adding a speciﬁc identiﬁer before the data
included in the frame is needed in order to receive a Zigbee
frame using XBee, so it requires the cooperation of the Zigbee
transmitter. These constraints can be easily addressed if the use
of CTC is legitimate and deliberate, however they prevent the
use of these solutions in a context of attack and especially
for pivoting attacks. Our approach overcomes these limits
and provides a reliable two-way CTC that doesn’t require the
cooperation of other devices: as a consequence, it may be used
in an offensive context.
The Packet-in-Packet strategy [13], proposed by T. Good-
speed et al. consists in encapsulating a complete radio frame
into an application-level payload: a misidentiﬁcation of the
beginning of the encapsulating frame by the receiver (e.g.,
due to interferences causing bitﬂips during the demodulation)
can lead to the interpretation of the encapsulated frame.
This strategy is particularly interesting for bypassing software
checks performed at the protocol layer, and may thus allow
attackers to access and control the lower layers of the radio
device. The authors highlight a possible use of this attack to
perform a pivoting attack, e.g., to inject radio trafﬁc corre-
sponding to a wireless protocol different from the protocol
natively supported by the radio device, under certain speciﬁc
conditions. However, this strategy can only be applied to a
limited number of protocols, and can only be achieved if
the modulations used have similar characteristics (frequency
bands, bandwidth, etc). For instance, M. Millian and V. Yadav
discuss the possibility of encapsulating 802.15.4 trafﬁc into
802.11 frames [14]. However, they stress the difﬁculty of such
a strategy due to the differences between the two technologies.
T. Goodspeed has also discovered a vulnerability in the
nRF24L01+ chip, that facilitates snifﬁng and frame injection
on a set of protocols (such as Bluetooth Low Energy or
Enhanced ShockBurst) using Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying
modulation. He was able to divert
the use of a register
dedicated to the address selection to select an arbitrary pream-
ble [15]. Exploiting this vulnerability allowed him to add a
promiscuous mode for the Enhanced ShockBurst, which is not
natively supported by the chip. However, it is also possible
to divert the use of this register to detect speciﬁc preambles
used by different wireless technologies, as long as similar
modulations and bit rates are used. This vulnerability has
been used by M. Newlin to develop a ﬁrmware aiming to add
advanced snifﬁng capabilities for the Enhanced ShockBurst
and Mosart protocols to the nRF24 chip [16].
D. Cauquil has also disclosed a similar vulnerability in other
Nordic Semiconductors chips [17], and has developed a similar
tool for the nRF51. He was then able to implement com-
munication primitives for a proprietary protocol not initially
supported by the chip, allowing it to control a mini-drone [18].
An implementation of these primitives has been integrated into
the radiobit [19] project.
These research works present some ﬁrst techniques and
experimental results that illustrate the practical feasibility of
pivoting attacks targeting wireless protocols. However, these
techniques have several limitations which strongly restrict their
use: they require an active cooperation of other devices, or the
modulation of the native protocol and the pivoting protocol
must be similar and sometimes depend on the use of speciﬁc
chips (such as Nordic SemiConductors nRF24 and nRF51
chips). Our main contribution is to present a pivoting attack
strategy that overcomes some of these constraints, allowing
the implementation of communication primitives targeting a
wireless technology using a modulation different from the one
natively supported by the chips that doesn’t require the coop-
eration of other nodes, and that could possibly be generalised
to multiple hardware devices from different manufacturers.
