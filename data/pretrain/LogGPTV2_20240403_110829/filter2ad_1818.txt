ABSTRACT
With the rapid expansion of customer population and link
bandwidth, energy expenditures of the Internet have been
rising dramatically. To gain energy eﬃciency, we propose a
novel router architecture, which allows each of its modules
to adjust frequency according to traﬃc loads. Several mod-
ulation strategies are also discussed to ensure dwell time
on low energy states and reduce blind switches. Our pre-
liminary results show that the frequency adjustment router
could save up to 40% of the total energy consumption.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, much surplus and redundancy are introduced
during network planning for rarely appeared traﬃc peak
hours and device failures, wasting energy most of the time
[1]. To cope with this situation, energy eﬃcient technolo-
gies, such as smart port sleeping, dynamic buﬀer adapting
and green routing, have been proposed to trade performance
for energy eﬃciency in idle or low traﬃc time.
Smart port sleeping explores a sleep-wake mechanism be-
tween active and sleep modes for energy savings in the phys-
ical layer, and later leads to the establishment of standard
IEEE 802.3az. However, due to considerable time and en-
ergy costs for transition, this method is only eﬀective while
port utilization rate is under 10% [2].
A. Vishwanath et al. explore buﬀer usage of routers and
develop a buﬀer adapting algorithm for letting SRAM and
DRAM buﬀers sleep while not being used [3]. Results show
that up to 10% of the total energy consumption could be
eliminated with negligible traﬃc congestion and latency.
From the network level, green routing exploits limiting
traﬃc forwarding in a subset of network links. The essence
of this idea is to optimize traﬃc modes for more energy
eﬃcient behaviors of network devices.
In this poster, we propose a frequency adjustment router
architecture which allows each of its functional module to

adopt diﬀerent frequencies, oﬀering various energy eﬃcien-
cies, traﬃc capacities and processing latencies. Our frequen-
cy adjustment router has more potential for energy saving
in the following aspects. First, aimed at functional modules
which accounts for about 50% of a router’s overall energy,
our method has more energy saving potentials than oth-
er methods (ports and memory chips account for 10% and
11% of the total energy consumption respectively) [4]; Sec-
ond, frequencies of each energy state could be customized for
various traﬃc environments. Third, modulations between
multiple frequencies are more ﬂexible for strategic switch-
ing than simple sleep and active switching. In addition, our
proposed frequency adjustment scheme is a essential supple-
ment, not a replacement, for current energy eﬃcient tech-
nologies, and the comprehensive utilization of those methods
could certainly achieves higher energy eﬃciency.
2. FREQUENCY ADJUSTMENT ROUTER
ARCHITECTURE
Our proposed architecture is shown in Fig.1. We treat
functional modules as basic adjustment units, namely fre-
quency adjustment zones. To support free frequencies mod-
ulation between modules, those units are connected with in-
ter clock domain interfaces for handling asynchronous clock
problems. Generally, the interface is an asynchronous FIFO
based one-way data path, which collects signal sequences
and stores them in FIFO according to one clock, and reads
the signals from FIFO and replays them with the pace of an-
other clock. In order to modulate frequencies of those units
cooperatively, a frequency adjustment arbiter is introduced

3. DYNAMIC FREQUENCY ADJUSTMENT
STRATEGIES
We developed several frequency switching strategies, dis-
tinguished by buﬀer occupancy threshold and cold down
time between transitions, to guarantee stay time in low en-
ergy states and reduce blind switches, described as follow:
Sleep/active switching: Triggered by ﬁxed buﬀer occu-
pancy threshold, we propose a two-stage switch strategy as
shown in Fig.2 (a), which allows modules to operate either
in sleep mode for energy savings, or in active mode (marked
as red) for processing packets in buﬀer.
Upper Boundary switching: This scheme permits multi-
stage switching, and always adopts an upper frequency level
that barely oﬀering more capacity for handling the traﬃc.
As shown in Fig.2 (b), energy states with diﬀerent frequen-
cies are distinguished by colors.
Dual-boundary switching: Fig.2 (c) describes a opti-
mized strategy of upper boundary idea. By introducing a
lower boundary, this scheme further reduces stay time in
upper frequency levels with the cost of limited switches.
Combined switching: This strategy combines ideas of
sleep/active switching and boundary switching, as shown
in Fig.2 (d), treating low traﬃc time (such as nights) with
sleeping strategy, and high traﬃc time with the aid of lower
boundary for reducing frequent switches.
4. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT
We developed a router simulator which oﬀers 10 frequen-
cies range from 125 MHz to 12.5 MHz, corresponding to
1000Mbps to 100Mbps respectively in traﬃc capacity. The
experiments were based on real traces captured bidirection-
ally from a oﬃce network of 1000 users, spinning over a
period of more than three hours and the loss rate was kept
under 1%. The preliminary results are shown in Fig.3, by
limiting switches with preset cold down time between tran-
sitions and processing packets in buﬀer at the maximum
speed, the combined strategy achieved the most signiﬁcant
savings than other methods.

5. CONCLUSION
In this poster, we proposed a novel frequency adjustment
router architecture, which allows each of its modules to
adopt multiple and diﬀerent frequencies. In addition, sev-
eral frequency adjustment strategies are also described for
tuning various network environments. Simulations on real
traces show that our frequency adjustment router could save
up to 40% of the total energy consumption.
