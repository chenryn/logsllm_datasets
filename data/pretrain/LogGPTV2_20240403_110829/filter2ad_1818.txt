## Abstract
With the rapid growth in the number of internet users and link bandwidth, energy consumption in the Internet has increased significantly. To address this, we propose a novel router architecture that allows each module to adjust its frequency based on traffic loads. Several modulation strategies are also discussed to ensure sufficient dwell time in low-energy states and minimize unnecessary switches. Our preliminary results show that the proposed frequency-adjustment router can save up to 40% of total energy consumption.

## 1. Introduction
Modern network planning often introduces significant redundancy to handle rare traffic peaks and device failures, leading to wasted energy during idle or low-traffic periods [1]. To mitigate this, various energy-efficient technologies such as smart port sleeping, dynamic buffer adapting, and green routing have been proposed to balance performance and energy efficiency.

- **Smart Port Sleeping:** This method involves a sleep-wake mechanism between active and sleep modes to save energy in the physical layer. It led to the establishment of the IEEE 802.3az standard. However, it is only effective when port utilization is below 10% due to the high transition costs [2].
- **Dynamic Buffer Adapting:** Vishwanath et al. developed an algorithm that allows SRAM and DRAM buffers to enter a sleep state when not in use, potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 10% with minimal impact on traffic congestion and latency [3].
- **Green Routing:** This approach limits traffic forwarding to a subset of network links, optimizing traffic patterns for more energy-efficient behavior of network devices.

In this work, we propose a frequency adjustment router architecture that allows each functional module to operate at different frequencies, providing varying levels of energy efficiency, traffic capacity, and processing latency. Our frequency adjustment router offers several advantages:
- It targets functional modules, which account for about 50% of a router's overall energy consumption, making it more energy-saving than other methods.
- Frequencies can be customized for different traffic environments.
- The flexibility of switching between multiple frequencies is greater than simple sleep/active transitions.
- Our proposed scheme complements existing energy-efficient technologies, and their combined use can achieve higher energy efficiency.

## 2. Frequency Adjustment Router Architecture
Our proposed architecture, shown in Figure 1, treats functional modules as basic adjustment units, or frequency adjustment zones. These units are connected via inter-clock domain interfaces to handle asynchronous clock issues. The interface typically consists of an asynchronous FIFO-based one-way data path that collects and stores signal sequences according to one clock and replays them with another clock. A frequency adjustment arbiter monitors system information such as FIFO occupancy, port utilization, and current energy status to make frequency adjustment decisions.

## 3. Dynamic Frequency Adjustment Strategies
We have developed several frequency switching strategies to ensure sufficient dwell time in low-energy states and reduce blind switches:

- **Sleep/Active Switching:** This two-stage strategy, triggered by a fixed buffer occupancy threshold, allows modules to switch between sleep mode (for energy savings) and active mode (for processing packets). See Figure 2(a).
- **Upper Boundary Switching:** This multi-stage strategy always adopts the minimum frequency level that can handle the current traffic. Different energy states are distinguished by colors. See Figure 2(b).
- **Dual-Boundary Switching:** This optimized version of the upper boundary strategy introduces a lower boundary to further reduce the time spent at higher frequencies, albeit with some limitations on switches. See Figure 2(c).
- **Combined Switching:** This strategy combines the sleep/active and boundary switching approaches, using sleep mode during low-traffic periods and boundary switching during high-traffic periods to minimize frequent switches. See Figure 2(d).

## 4. Experiments and Results
We developed a router simulator that supports 10 frequencies ranging from 125 MHz to 12.5 MHz, corresponding to traffic capacities from 1000 Mbps to 100 Mbps. The experiments were based on real traces captured bidirectionally from an office network with 1000 users over a period of more than three hours, with a loss rate kept under 1%. Preliminary results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that the combined strategy achieved the most significant energy savings compared to other methods.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel frequency adjustment router architecture that allows each module to operate at multiple and different frequencies. We also described several frequency adjustment strategies for tuning to various network environments. Simulations on real traces show that our frequency adjustment router can save up to 40% of total energy consumption.
