### Introduction

In addition to usability issues, the non-adoption of end-to-end (E2E) encrypted email is driven by incomplete threat models, misaligned incentives, and a lack of understanding of email architecture. Researchers have emphasized the need for comprehensive mental models of email security. Recent studies, such as those by Das et al., have explored the role of social influence in users' decisions to adopt secure tools and specific security features, particularly on platforms like Facebook. De Luca et al. found that peer influence, rather than security and privacy concerns, primarily drives the adoption of secure messaging apps, such as Threema.

Our study aims to delve deeper into the user experience of secure communications, identifying additional factors that lead to the adoption and abandonment of communication tools. We also seek to understand how users perceive the security of these tools, especially those advertised as secure. Previous work by Dourish et al. and Wash has highlighted the gaps in users' mental models, leading to a false sense of security. Our qualitative approach, similar to Dourish et al.'s, seeks to understand users' security needs and practices as an "everyday, practical problem."

### Methodology

#### A. Research Questions

Our research explores the following questions:
1. Why, when, and how do users use secure communications? (Section III-C1)
2. What threats do users want to protect against when communicating? (Section III-C2)
3. Which communication tools do users perceive as secure or insecure, and why? (Section III-C3)
4. How do users think secure communications can be achieved, and how can they be breached? (Section III-C4)

#### B. Participants

Our literature review indicates that the needs and practices of mainstream users regarding secure communications have not been extensively studied. Instead of focusing on at-risk populations, our study targets users who do not consider themselves at risk of targeted surveillance. We recruited participants through flyers and emails distributed at University College London and collaborating organizations. Out of 380 respondents to our pre-screening questionnaire, we conducted 10 unstructured and 50 semi-structured interviews with a diverse group of 60 participants. This represents the largest qualitative study on this topic to date.

#### C. Interview Procedure

The value of qualitative research lies in providing a holistic understanding of the phenomenon under study. A single trained researcher conducted all 60 interviews in English, starting with 10 unstructured interviews and then 50 semi-structured interviews. The emerging themes from the unstructured interviews shaped the script for the semi-structured interviews. The key areas covered in the interviews were:

1. **Adoption of Communication Tools:**
   - Participants specified the communication tools they use and the reasons for adopting or abandoning them.
   - Key questions included: 
     - Why did you decide to adopt [this communication tool]?
     - Who do you communicate with?
     - What kind of information do you regard as "sensitive"?
     - Have you ever sent sensitive information via a communication tool?

2. **Definition of Secure Communications:**
   - Participants were asked about the security properties a communication tool should provide and their mental models of secure communications.
   - They were invited to draw how a communication tool works and explain their reasoning.

3. **Security Ranking of Communication Tools:**
   - Participants ranked the security of the communication tools they use and compared their rankings with the EFF Secure Messaging Scorecard.
   - They were given 10 minutes to explore the scorecard and ask clarifying questions.

4. **Security Properties and Mechanisms:**
   - Participants were probed on their understanding of encryption, digital signatures, and cryptographic fingerprints.
   - They were asked to interpret the criteria on the EFF Scorecard.

#### D. Pilot Study

A pilot study with five semi-structured interviews was conducted to refine the interview script and identify potential issues. Six researchers reviewed the study, and convenience sampling was used to select participants for the pilot.

#### E. Data Analysis

We conducted multiple rounds of interviews, punctuated by periods of analysis and tentative conclusions. Data saturation was observed between the 40th and 45th interviews. The audio recordings were transcribed and independently coded using Grounded Theory analysis. The average Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (κ) for all themes was 0.83, indicating excellent inter-coder agreement.

#### F. Ethics

The Research Ethics Board at University College London approved our project. All participants signed a consent form, and data was handled confidentially in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. No participant withdrew from the study.

#### G. Limitations

Our study, while large for a qualitative study, did not cover a wide range of cultural backgrounds, which may limit generalizability. Additionally, the quality of the research depends on the researcher's skills and potential biases. Fatigue set in during the final 20 minutes of the interviews, and some participants may have altered their answers due to concern about the interviewer's perception.

### Results

In this section, we present the key themes observed across our interviews. We report participants' statements and the frequency of each theme. Several misconceptions about secure communications were identified, which are detailed in Sections IV-A to IV-H.

#### A. Adoption Criteria of Communication Tools
