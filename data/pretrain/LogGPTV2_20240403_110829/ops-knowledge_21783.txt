User: I have a python script which I would like to run at regular intervals.  I am running windows 7.  What is the best way to accomplish this?  Easiest way?
Assistant: You can use the GUI from the control panel (called "scheduled tasks") to add a task, most of it should be self-explanatory, but there are two things to watch out for:

Make sure you fill in C:\python27\python.exe as the program path, and the path to your script as the argument.
If you choose Run whether user is logged on or not I get an error: The directory name is invalid (0x87010B). Choosing Run only when user is logged on "solves" this issue.

This took me quite a bit to figure out ...
