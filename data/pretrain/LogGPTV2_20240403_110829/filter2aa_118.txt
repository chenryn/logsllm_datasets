Agenda
• Standards and Requirements
• Electro-Mechanical Locks
• Critical Infrastructure and
Vulnerabilities
• Real World Threats
• Case Studies
Standards
• Why we need Standards
• What They Measure
• Limited Protocol - Few Tests
• Exclude many “Real World Attacks”
– Bumping
– Mechanical Bypass
– Knowledgeable and Special Attack
Techniques - Not Contemplated
Standard Security
Criteria
• Define Conventional vs. High
Security
• Threat Criteria
– Forced Entry
– Covert Entry
– Key Security
• All Standards based upon
– Time, Tools and Training
Forced Entry
UL437 and BHMA 156.30
• Locks must be secure against
Forced methods of Attack
• Attack Resistance 5 Minutes
• Excludes many methods of
attack
Covert Entry
Protection
• Minimum Security Criteria in
UL437 and ANSI/BHMA 156.30
• Protects against Certain forms
of Covert Entry
• Assures Minimum resistance to
opening
– (10 - 15 minutes)
– Picking and Decoding
– Master Key Attacks
– Bumping (Not Covered)
Key Security
• Organizational Protection
– Duplication of Keys
– Keys Ordered by Code
• Legal Protection
– Availability of Blanks
• Does not address Technical
Security of Keys
• Standards = Limited Security
Categories of Locks
• Conventional Mechanical Locks
• High Security Mechanical
Locks
• Electronic Credentials
– Electro-Mechanical Locks
– Electronic Locks
– Wired, Wireless, Data on Card
Critical Questions
• What is SECURITY re: Locks?
• Is it secure enough?
• What does a High Security rating
mean?
• The concept of key control, key
security and why it’s important
• Can the lock be compromised and
how difficult is it?
• Real World Threats
• Methods to Compromise
Conventional Lock
Functions
• Restrict “WHO” can enter
• Prevent or Delay
Unauthorized Access
– Low to Medium security
– Not Certified
– Covert Entry often is easy
Conventional Lock
Vulnerabilities
• Picking, Bumping, Decoding
• Impressioning
• Master Key Extrapolation
• Mechanical Bypass
• Failure of Key Control
– Duplication of keys
– Simulation of Keys
– Replication of Keys
Conventional Locks:
Adequate?
• No tracking of access,
attempts, how often or when
• Add or Duplicate keys
• Key Security
• Master Key System In-Security
• No evidence of Breach
• No Intelligence in lock or
key
Conventional v.
High Security
• Conventional Cylinders
– Easy to Pick or Bump open
– No Key Control
– Limited Forced Entry resistance
• High Security Cylinders
– UL and BHMA/ANSI Standards
• UL-437 and BHMA/ANSI 156.30
– Higher quality and tolerances
– Resistance to Forced and Covert Entry
– Key Control
High Security
Increased Protection?
• Protect high value targets
• Stringent security requirements
• Standards (UL and BHMA/ANSI)
• Threat Level is higher
• Minimum security criteria
– Attack times and resistance
– More difficult to compromise
– Higher key control
High Security
Critical Differences
• Multiple security layers
• More than one point of failure
• Each security layer is independent
• Security layers operate in parallel
• Difficult to bypass each layer
• Difficult to derive intelligence about
a layer
• Difficult to simulate the action of a
key
Mechanical Locks:
Design Limitations
• Good for one person, one key
• No Key / User Tracking
• Addition of deletion of keys
to the system
• Lost stolen or copied keys
• Manipulation of keys (Mul-T-
Lock and key interchange)
Electronic Locks:
The Security Solution?
Electro-Mechanical
Locks
• Mechanical Locks+
• Electronic Credentials
– STILL Mechanical Locks
• Two Parallel Locking Systems
– Mechanically keyed alike
– Mechanically master-keyed
– Key bitting assigned to each
customer
Electronic Access
Control Systems
• Mechanical lock designs
• Electronic Credentials
– I-button, RFID, SmartCard
– Many different protocols
• Security Layers
– Protocol
– Mechanical locking system
– Audit Functions
– Key Security
Medeco LOGIC
Higher Security?
Medeco LOGIC Keys
Mul-T-Lock Cliq:
Similar Technology
Salto and EVVA:
A Different Approach
Critical
Infrastructure
• Transportation - Aviation and
Airport Security
• Cargo and Transport
• Power Facilities
• Finance and Banking
• Server Rooms
• Defense
• Public Safety
CI: Vulnerabilities
• Intrusion (Sabotage and Vandalism)
• Theft of Critical and High Value
Targets
• Terrorism
• Data Leakage
• Identity Theft
• Interruption of Critical or
Essential Services
Airports and Aircraft
Aviation Security
• US Aviation Transportation
Security Act (2001)
• Defines Requirements for:
Airports, Highways, Buses,
Ports, Mass Transit
– Controls Physical Access for 450
Airports
– Control, Track and Analyze
Individual Access and Attempts to
Secure Areas
Airport Security
• Section 106: Airport
Perimeter Protection
• Security Technology to
manage Access Control
• Positively Verify the
Identity of each Employee
and Law Enforcement Officer
• Test and Assure Compliance
Airport Security
• Layered Security Approach
• Physical Security of Fixed
Assets
• Beaches: Trace directly to
Lock and User Violations
• Copying Keys
Conventional Locks
Not Secure for Airport
Protection
• Duplication of Keys
• No User-Auditable Information
• No Scheduling Capabilities
(Time Lock)
• Master Key Systems:
– No Identification of Employee
or Ability to Test System
Private Aircraft
Medeco Cam-Locks
Cargo - Containers
Cargo - Access
• Electronic Access Control
Systems
• Electronic Padlocks with
Audit Capabilities
– Identify Tampering
– Deter Contraband Introduction
and other Attacks
Medeco NexGen
Power Generation
Power Plants
• Gas, Oil, Power-Grid
• Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC)
• North America Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC)
• Reliability of Electricity
– Security of Physical Assets
– Security of Electronic Data
Security Requirements
• Prevent Attacks (Both
Physical and Electronic)
• Access to Data and Equipment
– Hard Assets: Generating
Plants,Equipment,Transmission,
Networks
– Physical Access and Attempts
Critical
Infrastructure
Protection
• CIP-006-1:
The Physical Security Plan must:
“Contain procedures for
identifying, controlling and
monitoring all access points and
authorization requests.”
“Logging of Physical Access must
occur at all times and the
information logged must be
sufficient to uniquely identify
individuals”
Financial Data
• Sarbanes Oxley Act (2002)
– Financial Reporting for Public
Corporations
– Quality of Financial Reporting
– IT and Internal Controls
– Data Center Access Security
Financial Data
Integrity and Security
• Control and Safeguard Data
• Validity of Financial Reports
• Physical Control of Access to
Information
– Data Protection
– Theft
– Manipulation or Exploitation
– Unauthorized Access
Data Center Security
• Must Control Physical Access
to servers to Protect Data
• Electronic Access
– Passwords, Firewalls, IPS,
Encryption
Physical Access = Game Over
Real World Threats
• High Security Locks
• Electronic Access Control
Systems
– Total Compromise
– False Sense of Security
– Liability?
2008
• High Security Lock
Vulnerabilities
• Total Compromise of Covert
and Forced Entry including a
total failure of Key Control
Mechanical Locks
Not Enough Protection
• Good for One Person - One Key
• Used where no tracking is
required

Reading the Key
What Happens if one Layer is
Bypassed?
Magnetic Attacks
Ulmann & Zacher
Cliq and Logic
Security Issues: Keys
• Mechanical Keys
• Wafer or Pin Tumbler Systems
• Often “Keyed Alike” Systems
– Keys Only cut at Factory
– Electronic Technology inside Key
• Mul-T-Lock results of Keyed
Alike and Key Duplication
Cliq and Logic
Simulated Credentials
• Possess Key and Simulate or
Bypass Credentials
One Lost Key =
Total Compromise of System!
Mul-T-Lock Click and
Magnets
Invisible Access
Audit Trail Bypass
• Audit trail is dependent
upon reading the Lock or Key
• If there is NO Audit Trail:
– False Sense of Security
– False Blame
– Unknown Compromise
– No Evidence of Entry
Cliq and Logic
Security
From Medeco:
“Unauthorized Key Copying is
removed from the Equation”
“Superior Protection against
Unauthorized Key Copying”
Cliq,Logic and Nexgen
Potential Issues
• One lost, stolen or deleted key
may compromise entire system
• Simulation of Credentials
• Simulation of Keys
