User: What is virtualization technology? Please explain the key concepts and principles involved.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a software technology that enables multiple operating systems and applications to run on the same physical machine by virtualizing physical resources (such as cpu, memory, storage, network, etc.) into multiple logical entities. It can help businesses save on physical equipment costs, improve server resource utilization, and improve application reliability and flexibility. The key concepts and principles of virtualization technology include: 1. Hypervisor (virtual machine monitor): also known as virtual machine management program (VMM), is a software layer that allows multiple virtual machines to share physical hardware resources, including CPU , memory and storage, etc. The hypervisor can manage and control the behavior of virtual machines accessing hardware resources, thereby providing virtual machines with a clear virtual hardware address space and ensuring the isolation between virtual machines. 2. Virtual machine: A virtual machine is a virtual operating system created on the basis of virtualization technology. Virtual machines can be transplanted and run on different operating systems and hardware platforms. Through virtual machine technology, users can run and manage multiple virtual machines on the same host machine, isolate resource management and application deployment and ensure the independence of each virtual machine. 3. Virtualization software: It is software running on the virtual machine layer, which can simulate a virtual environment independent of physical hardware, including independent operating systems, applications, storage and network protocols. Common virtualization software includes VMware, Hyper-V, KVM, Xen, etc. 4. Resource pool: Virtualization technology can gather physical resources (such as cpu, memory, storage, network, etc.) into a resource pool, and multiple virtual machines can share this resource pool to achieve higher resource utilization and better performance. load balancing. 5. Types of virtualization: Types of virtualization include full virtualization, paravirtualization, and containerization. Full virtualization refers to placing the entire operating system and applications in a virtual machine, and all hardware requests are handled by the hypervisor. Paravirtualization means that only the system API is virtualized, and the application program runs directly on the kernel of the host system. Containerization refers to the creation of independent containers on the same operating system, each container can run applications in its own namespace and isolated from other containers.
