Creating a Typescript test file ... I need to mock some test objects that I
will use as props in my test... I found that when I use `{
      test: 'Hello',
    };
    test('hello', async ({ page, mount }) => {
      console.log(myVar);
    });
**Steps**
  * Run or debug the test
**Expected**  
No Error
**Actual**  
SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected "}" (8:6)
Personally I never use TSX or JSX... I looked but I couldn't find an option...
is there a way to just turn that kind of parsing off?  
Thanks!
