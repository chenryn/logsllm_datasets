Abstract. Despite growing link capacities, over-dimensioned buffers are still caus-
ing, in the Internet of the second decade of the third millennium, hosts to suffer
from severe queuing delays (or bufferbloat). While maximum bufferbloat possibly
exceeds few seconds, it is far less clear how often this maximum is hit in practice.
This paper reports on our ongoing work to build a spatial and temporal map of
Internet bufferbloat, describing a system based on distributed agents running on
PlanetLab that aims at providing a quantitative answer to the above question.
1 Introduction
Given the abundance of active measurement approaches, it may seem at ﬁrst sight
redundant to focus on bufferbloat measurement via active techniques. Yet, this work
nicely ﬁt in a gap of the design space explored by the research community.
Our system targets large-scale high-frequency scanning, customized to periodically
report very detailed per-host statistics (e.g., percentiles). As individual probes are ca-
pable of scanning about 10K hosts in a second, it follows that using 100 PlanetLab
nodes we could in principle follow about 1 million hosts every second or, trading space
for time, cover the whole Internet in about one hour. Interest of our approach can be
summarized as follows.
Due to architectural similarities with scanners [1, 10] and systems based on dis-
tributed agents [2, 3], our approach allows to achieve spatial scales larger than [8, 11]
(already in this paper) and [4,5] (prospectively). Additionally, our efﬁcient implementa-
tion allows much higher scan frequency than [2–5, 8, 11], where the frequency of back-
ground latency measurement is typically too sparse to offer an adequate bufferbloat
characterization from the user perspective. Finally, in terms of the delay statistics, we
avoid to measure maximum latency under controlled load as in [8, 9, 11], and rather
gather the (typical) delay by continuous host measurement, hence sampling the user
load during their normal activities.
2 Bufferbloat Scanner Architecture
Building over TopHat [6], we design a distributed architecture for Internet bufferbloat
scanning. At the core of our scanner, lay an efﬁcient tool to ping a large amount of hosts

with the least possible resources. While our tool is far less efﬁcient than the recently
released zMap, it is still an order of magnitude faster than the fastest settings of the
Nmap Scripting Engine.
We divide measurement periods (of 5 minutes by default), at the beginning of which
each measurement server ask for instructions (essentially, a list of destinations/subnets
and the sampling frequency, 1 Hz by default). At the end of each measurement period,
per-hosts statistics (delay percentiles, etc.) are collected for further post-processing.
For each target, we gauge the queuing delay via ICMP measurements as qi = RT Ti−
minj≤i RT Tj. By ensuring that queuing does not happens at the measurement servers,
we can however correctly infer the remote queuing delay. We validate this approach
(i) to be very accurate with non-NATted hosts, (ii) to yield a coarse queuing indication
(e.g., a binary bufferbloat ﬂag) for NATted hosts.
We notice that the generally measurement are initiated by the end-host [4, 5, 8, 9]
(SamKnows/BISmark [11] slightly differ in that measurement starts from the HGW).
In our case, measurement are instead targeting the end-hosts: this is common in large-
scale census studies [1, 10] (of which we inherit the scalability property) but has not
been explored so far, to the best of our knowledge, for bufferbloat measurements.
3 Measurement Campaign
We report results on a preliminary measurement campaign. We focus on moderate num-
ber of hosts O(104) on the same ISPs, that we continuously probe at 0.5 Hz frequency
from 2 separate PlanetLab nodes for a period of about 8 continuous hours. Overall, we
receive replies to 47% of our sent packets, for a total of O(108) valid samples – using
only two PlanetLab servers, we already achieve a quite signiﬁcant scale in terms of
spatial reach and temporal frequency.
For validation purposes, we infer (i) the access type (AT) of our target hosts by issu-
ing reverse DNS queries, as well as (ii) the remote operating system (OS) through nmap
ﬁngerprinting. As for the access type, we expect the breakdown of queuing delay along
DSL, FTTH and cable access to yield an intuitive validation of the observed statistics.
Additionally, we argue that in case the remote OS is reliably found to be a Windows OS,

then queuing delay are representative of non-NATted host statistics (where our method-
ology is more reliable). Overall, we manage to infer both AT and OS information for
2546 hosts: while this subset is not statistically signiﬁcant, it nevertheless allows to
validate our methodology as it covers the full AT× OS cross-product.
We collect per-host percentiles during 5 minutes windows: Fig. 1 reports the Cumu-
lative Distribution Function (CDF) of a few per-host queuing delay statistics, gathered
over all hosts and measurement rounds. Left plot reports the maximum queuing delay
CDF: as expected, from the picture clearly emerges that (a) ﬁber access suffers the low-
est delays irrespectively from the OSs, (b) cable delays are only slightly higher, whereas
(c) DSL end-hosts may seldom suffer from delays close to 1 sec. We further report the
50th (right) and 90th (middle) percentiles CDF. Notice further that (d) from practical
purposes, the 90th percentile is lower than 100 ms under any combination of OS and
AT – including end-hosts behind DSL. Moreover, since the win:cable and win:dsl lines
now clearly separate from the others, we infer that the methodology needs to be reﬁned
as it likely underestimates bufferbloat delay for NATted hosts – although observation
(d) suggests bufferbloat to be a not necessarily frequent problem.
