User: I have LibreOffice installed on a Windows machine.  LibreOffice comes with a bundled python.exe (version 3.3) to allow you to write LibreOffice macros in Python.  This works fine.  But the bundled python routines don't come with the IDLE python ide as far as I can see.
1) If I download and install Python on my machine will that interfere with the execution of LibreOffice python macros (by changing Python environmental variables, register settings etc.?
or
2) Is there a way to download IDLE or another free Python IDE and have it work with the Python bundled into LibreOffice?
Assistant: LibreOffice comes bundled with it's own copy of python. (Python 3.3 I think)
So the answer to your question is no, it will not.
I have found that a simple way of debugging python macros in libreoffice is to run libreoffice from the command line and put print commands in the macros. This at least allows you to trace where you are and what key values are as the print commands echo onto the terminal screen.
