ABSTRACT
Internet topology information is only made available in aggregate
form by standard routing protocols. Connectivity information and
latency characteristics must therefore be inferred using indirect tech-
niques. In this paper we consider measurements using a distributed
set of measurement points or beacons. We show that computing the
minimum number of required beacons on a network under a BGP-
like routing policy is NP-hard and at best Ω(log n)-approximable.
In the worst case at least (n − 1)/3 and at most (n + 1)/3 beacons
are required for a network with n nodes. We then introduce some
observations that allow us to propose a relatively small candidate
set of beacons for the current Internet topology. The set proposed
has properties with relevant applications for all-paths routing on the
public Internet and performance based routing.

INTRODUCTION
Efﬁcient routing and caching require accurate connectivity infor-
mation of the Internet. However, by their very nature, Internet pro-
tocols make this task difﬁcult. Routing decisions are made locally
and most often shared across organizations only in aggregate form.
Furthermore connectivity changes dynamically due to node or link
failures and router misconﬁguration. At any given time between
1.5% and 3.4% of connections suffer a visible pathology [29]. Em-
pirically, it has been observed that a few key failures often have
signiﬁcant impact on routing decisions.

Routing decisions and content distribution networks (web caches)
require proper connectivity and latency information so as to di-
rect trafﬁc in an optimal fashion. The family of internet protocols
collect and distribute only a limited amount of information on the
topology, connectivity and state of the network. Hence the infor-
mation of interest, be it latency, topology, or connectivity has to be
inferred from experimental measurements. Gathering connectivity
information through indirect measurements is known as Internet
tomography [15, 37, 14]. In this work we consider the problem of
determining the topology of the Internet under the assumption that
a distributed set of measurement points (sometimes called beacons)
running special software is deployed at key sites across the entire
Internet. This has emerged as one of the strategies of choice for
measuring the state of the Internet (e.g. [33, 7, 3, 36, 18]).
1.1 Related Work
There are two distinctive types of measurements that can be ob-
tained through the use of tomography: (1) obtain an accurate map
of the slowly evolving link topology of the network, and (2) de-
tect short-lived, transient effects. For the ﬁrst objective, we can use
long lived processes, spawning perhaps several days, while for the
second we need a fast and accurate method of detecting changes,
with as light a load as possible on the network.
Currently there are several efforts in progress to obtain topology
and performance measurements on the Internet [33, 26, 7, 37, 3, 36,
18], several of which use some form of measurement points to ex-
tract information from the network. In practice these measurement
points are often placed in universities and other organizations that
are willing to host the software or hardware required. The location
of these measurement devices or beacons is determined according
to various heuristics [1, 4, 10, 13, 7]
Extensive research has taken place over the last few years on de-
ploying measurement points and studying their characteristics. For
example the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI)
[1, 2, 3, 31, 18] is a concerted effort to deploy general purpose
beacons, termed “NIMI probes” with particular focus in scalabil-
ity and ﬂexibility. Some other measurement efforts of note are, in
no particular order, MINC [12], the Internet Weather Report [33],
Cheswick et al. visualization project [13], Claffy et al. efforts on
internet tomography [15, 14], SPAND [35], Malan and Jahandian’s
Windmill [27], as well as a set of performance measurements that
relied implicitly on a distributed measurement architecture (e.g.
[16, 21, 22, 29, 30, 20]).
While substantial efforts have been directed at the deployment
and use of distributed measurement systems, there has been some-
what less research focused on the systematic study of the properties
required for such measurement sets. Jamin et al. propose theoreti-
cal methods as well as ad hoc heuristics for computing the location
of a set of measurement points whose aim is to compute the dis-
tance maps on the network [25]. Recently, Barford et al. provided
the ﬁrst systematic experimental study to validate the empirical ob-
servation that a relatively small number of measurement points is
generally sufﬁcient to obtain an accurate map of the network [8].
Lastly, Bu et al. consider the problem of the effectiveness of tomog-
raphy on networks of general topology [11]. While their focus is on
the ability to infer performance data from a set of multicast trees,
their systematic study of the abilities of tomography in arbitrary
networks is germane to our work, as we also consider the place-
ment of measurement points both in the current internet topology
and in general networks of arbitrary topology.
In this paper we study the optimal and systematic placement of
these beacons and the properties of a beacon set mapping the net-
work both under theoretical and empirical analysis.
First we take a theoretical tack and prove in Section 4 that com-
puting the minimum number of required beacons is NP-hard under
a BGP-like routing policy on a general network. Using a reduc-
tion to minimum set cover we prove that at best this problem is
Ω(log n)-approximable. We show that in terms of the number of
nodes on the network, in the worst case at least (n − 1)/3 and at
most (n + 1)/3 beacons are required for a network with n nodes.
Then in Sections 5 and 6 we use an empirical approach build-
ing upon measurement data published elsewhere in the literature
to show that placing beacons on a few thousand specially selected
nodes sufﬁces to map the current Internet. This seems to be within
the range of feasibility for a large connectivity-sensitive organiza-
tion such as a content distribution network (CDNs). Moreover, it
follows from the analysis that by placing special tunnelling nodes
on higher arity nodes it is possible to route over all possible paths on
the Internet, thus allowing to overlay an arbitrary routing protocol
on top of the public Internet forming a Resilient Overlay Network
(RON) [5].
2. THE MODEL
Consider a computer network, such as the Internet, in which ev-
ery node can transmit a data message to any other with proper ac-
knowledgement if successful. That is, in its proper state the net-
work is connected.
We model the network as an undirected graph. Hosts correspond
to nodes and links to edges. Every node in the network can apply
local routing policy decisions. However, those routing policies are
such that the network is connected in its proper state, e.g. the root
of a tree cannot refuse to carry transit trafﬁc from one branch to
another regardless of local routing policy.
The edges are labelled with non-negative weights indicating some
metric such as latency or AS-hop distance. The path taken by a
message can be determined at the source. In particular, in the case
of the Internet this can be obtained separately through a tracer-
oute call.
BGP supports a variety of mechanisms to establish routing pol-
icy. Two of the most common are AS-hop path length heuristic and
administrator deﬁned preferences. We consider two routing mod-
els: (a) arbitrary routing, which reﬂects a network in which all pol-
icy decisions are made based on arbitrary local preferences and (b)
link distance or AS-hop length minimization. In the earlier case, in
each node of higher arity, the administrator declares a single pre-
ferred route whenever more than one choice is available, and in the
latter case a distance minimization (BGP- or OSPF-like) routing
policy is assumed. Interestingly, in practice, while the network is
not fully AS-hop metric routed, AS-path prepending is often used
for implementing ad-hoc routing policy, rather than LOCAL-PREF

[17, 9]. AS-path prepending preserves most AS-hop metric prop-
erties, so our results apply in that scenario as well.
In this paper we consider a BGP-like routing policy in which
weights attached along a given path are non-decreasing as distance
increases. A node may set a local preference policy by which one
path is preferred over another regardless of weight or may choose
not to broadcast available connectivity to a node if an alternate path
is known to be available. We assume that when forwarding a mes-
sage, a node does not route a message back to the path from the
sender to itself, unless it has already tried all alternative routes and
determined that there was no transit path through any of its other
neighbours to the destination1. In the latter case the message is sent
back towards the node from whence it came.
We consider networks in which the routing policy at each node
is applied consistently. That is, the routing policy is not changing
in an adversarial fashion. The network behaves as expected with
the exception of links that are down, which are presumed to be in
that state for a non-instantaneous time duration. More formally, if
node v is to send a message to node u, v will always ﬁrst try to
use the same link (edge) on the network. This implies that for any
pair of nodes (v, u), whenever all edges are usable, the path to be
followed by a message sent from v for u is uniquely determined.
3. BASIC CONCEPTS
On the Internet, a collection of nodes under a single routing pol-
icy and running under a single technical administration is called
an Autonomous System (AS) [23]. Informally, an AS is said to be
multihomed if it is directly connected to more than one national ser-
vice provider (NSP). We consider a generalization of this concept
to nodes that are not necessarily border routers as well as multiple
provider points, even to the same ISP. An ordered pair of nodes u
and v are said to exhibit arity m if there are precisely m edges in-
cident with u which are connected to v other than through u. The
arity of a node u is the maximum over all other nodes v of the arity
exhibited by the pair u and v.
Notice that the arity of a node is never greater than the degree of
the node. Furthermore as the network is connected, every node can
be reached through at least one path, therefore every node has arity
of at least one. Figure 1 shows a node of degree k that yet has a
unique choice for each message routing operation and hence is of
arity 1. In contrast Figure 2 shows a node of degree 2 and arity 2.
A node with arity m ≥ 2 is said to be of higher arity.
The notion of arity introduces an interesting classiﬁcation on
routers. Consider a network with redundant paths to a destination
from a given router. That is, a higher arity node. Higher arity nodes
necessitate a routing policy to determine in which of several valid
directions to forward a message. That is, in a network where all
nodes are of arity 1 there is no need for a routing policy (although
distribution of paths is still a required function). Observe that mul-
tihomed networks contain nodes of higher arity.
A node u is said to offer transit if, for any node v which exhibits

higher arity from node u, then whenever u can send a message to v
via an edge (u, q) then q can send a message to v via u. This reﬂects
the standard internet usage in which multihomed nodes are said to
offer transit only if they provide external access to the multiplicity
of paths. The routing on a network is said to be monotonic if a
subpath of any route path is also a route path. In other words, let
(u0, u1, . . . , un) be the path taken by a message from a node u0 to
