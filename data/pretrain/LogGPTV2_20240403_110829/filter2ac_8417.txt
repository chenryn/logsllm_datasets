### Title: Black Hat Asia 2023: Firmware War: An Imminent Threat to the Foundation of Computing

The global IT supply chain is currently under intense scrutiny, driven by a confluence of factors including production shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread work-from-home policies, geopolitical tensions, and the re-balkanization of technology design and production. The 2020 SolarWinds attacks highlighted the real-world risks of supply chain attacks. However, one often-overlooked area of risk is enterprise devices and the firmware that controls them. These systems operate in highly privileged areas of the computing industry and, due to their critical nature and the difficulty in patching them, are often neglectedâ€”though not by attackers.

In this presentation, we will unveil new research that began with a ransomware group and culminated in a significant coordinated disclosure effort to address vulnerabilities at the top of the firmware supply chain. The vulnerabilities we discovered are located in an industry-standard management API, making them easily exploitable yet well-hidden. It took a data exposure incident for these flaws to be uncovered. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can grant an attacker permanent administrative access to millions of servers worldwide.

We will also discuss how low-level attacks, once the exclusive domain of nation-states, are now being adopted by cybercriminals and ransomware groups. The talk will highlight the challenges organizations face in assessing their firmware risk and emphasize the importance of accountability in the modern technology supply chain.

Please note that this will be a remote (virtual) presentation.
