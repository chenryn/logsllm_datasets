Combining (76), (82) and (74) concludes the proof of step 1.
In step two, we prove for any ε > 0 by recursively applying the
bootstrapping procedure in step 1. Assume the following statement
is true: for any θ ≥ m there exist constants ¯aθ , ¯Aθ so that for all
s, t ≥ 0,
˜q[s, s + t] ≤ ¯Aθ exp(−¯aθ t
1/θ).

By step 1, it holds for m = 2.

Divide [s, s + t] into t
the r th sub-interval is:
m2m−1 , so that
Jr := [s + (r − 1)t
m2m−1 , s + rt
m2m−1 ].
Now look at the first, fourth, seventh, etc sub-intervals, i.e. all
the r = 1 mod 3 sub-intervals. Introduce the event that in the ℓ-th
1 mod 3th sub-interval, an adversary tree that is rooted at a honest
block arriving in that sub-interval or in the previous (0 mod 3)
sub-interval catches up with a honest block in that sub-interval or
in the next (2 mod 3) sub-interval. Formally,

E PROOF OF PERSISTENCE AND LIVENESS
In this section, we will prove Lemma 4.4. Our goal is to generate a
transaction ledger that satisfies persistence and liveness as defined
in section 4.1. Together, persistence and liveness guarantees robust
transaction ledger [GKL15]; honest transactions will be adopted to
the ledger and be immutable.

Proof. We first prove persistence by contradiction. For a chain
Ct with the last block mined at time t, let C ⌈σ
be the chain resulting
from pruning a chain Ct up to σ, by removing the last blocks at the
end of the chain that were mined after time t − σ. Note that C ⌈σ is
a prefix of C, which we denote by C ⌈σ ⪯ C.
Let Ct denote the longest chain adopted by an honest node with
the last block mined at time t. Suppose there exists a longest chain
C′
adopted by some honest node with the last block mined at time
t
t′ > t and C ⌈σ
⪯̸ Ct′. There are a number of honest blocks mined in
the time interval [t−σ , t], each of which can be in Ct , Ct′, or neither.
We partition the set of honest blocks generated in that interval with
three sets: {Ht ≜ {Hj ∈ Ct : τj ∈ [t − σ , t]},Ht′ ≜ {Hj ∈ Ct′ :
τj ∈ [t − σ , t]}, and Hrest ≜ {Hj (cid:60) Ct ∪ Ct′
: τj ∈ [t − σ , t]},
depending on which chain they belong to.
holds for all j
such that τj ∈ [t − σ , t]. This in turn implies that P(C ⌈σ
⪯̸ Ct′) ≤
P(∩j:τj ∈[t−σ,t] ˆF c
j ). However, we know that the probability of this
happening is as low as qσ . This follows from the following facts.
(i) the honest blocks in Ct does not make it to the longest chain at
time t′: Hj (cid:60) Ct′ for all Hj ∈ Ht , which follows from C ⌈σ
⪯̸ Ct′.
(ii) the honest blocks in Ct′ does not make it to the longest chain
Ct at time t: Hj (cid:60) Ct for all Hj ∈ Ht′, which also follows from
C ⌈σ
⪯̸ Ct′. (iii) the rest of the honest blocks did not make it to
either of the above: Hj (cid:60) Ct ∪ Ct′ for all Hj ∈ Hrest.
We next prove liveness. Assume a transaction tx is received by
all honest nodes at time t, then we know that with probability at
least 1− qσ , there exists one honest block bj mined at time τ h
with
j
j ∈ [t, t + σ] and event ˆFj occurs, i.e., the block bj and its ancestor

Then we claim that C ⌈σ
⪯̸ Ct′ implies that ˆF c

must be contained in block bj or one ancestor block of bj since
tx is seen by all honest nodes at time t  τb as the first
Figure 8: Chains C and C′ for an arbitrary attack π. In this
example, k = 6, H = 6, and, A = 9. db − dh
= 3, and, the
attack succeeds at time t, at which b is exactly 6 blocks deep
in the chain C. Hence, in this example, d is exactly equal to
(k − 1) + (db − dh
i ) = 5 + 3 = 8
i
time block b disappears from the public longest chain C after it
becomes k deep within C at some previous time. We will prove this
part of the theorem by showing that πSZ also succeeds in removing
b from C after it becomes k deep, for the same sequence of block
mining times.
Let T be the blocktree built under π, and, observe that the public
longest chain, C(t), contains block b at time t. By our assumption,
we know that at time t, there exists a parallel chain C′ with depth
greater than or equal to L(t), depth of C at time t, and, C′ does not
include b. Hence, it also does not include any of the blocks that
came to C after b. See Figure 8 for a visual example of the chains
C and C′. Let hi be the last honest block in C′ that is also on C.
Such a block hi must exist; otherwise, these chains could not have
grown from the same genesis block. Then, hi has depth smaller
than the depth of b. In this context, let dh
i < db, denote
and db, dh
i
the depths of hi and b respectively. Define H as the number of
honest blocks mined in the time interval (τ h
i , t], and, observe that
all of these honest blocks lay in the depth interval (dh
i , L(t)] of the
blocktree T(t) as there cannot be honest blocks at depths larger
than L(t) at time t.
. Let d :=
L(t)−dh
, and, define A as the number of adversary blocks mined in

the time interval (τ h
the adversary blocks that are within these chains and have depths
greater than dh
. Now, as
i
there can be at most one honest block at every depth due to ∆ = 0;
, either C and C′ have two
H ≤ d. Moreover, at each depth after dh
i
distinct blocks, or, they share the same block, which by definition
is an adversary block. Hence, the number of the adversary blocks
that are within these chains and have depths greater than dh
is at
i
least d, which implies A ≥ d. Hence,
Next, consider the portion of T(t) deeper than dh

Finally, we know from the definition of persistence that block b has
