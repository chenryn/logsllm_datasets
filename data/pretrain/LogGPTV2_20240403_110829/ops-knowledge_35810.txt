User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题User is set as a local admin but gets access denied when trying to install software I upgraded some machines to XP SP3, and now whenever the user tries to install anything they get a "You must be an administrator" dialog box; however I went in locally and added the user as part of the Administrator's group to the local computer's Users and Groups (i.e. Admin Tools -> Computer Management -> Local Users and Groups).  The user has standard rights on the domain but nothing that would block this; users on SP2 don't have this problem and can install software.

How do I go about fixing this?  It's getting annoying for the users to have to call me over and then have to log out, then log back in as the local Administrator account in order to install anything or configure an IP printer (option is grayed out except with Administrator account).

Assistant: Two quick things I can think:

1) If you have a "Restricted Users" GPO set up in your domain, they may be getting removed from the Administrators group everytime there is a gpupdate (~ every 15mins)

2) Have you tried right-clicking (or SHIFT right-clicking) on the install file and choosing "Run as Administrator..."?
