identiﬁcation rates based on the number of guesses in Nexus 5 and iPhone 5
compared to random guessing. As shown on the ﬁgure, TouchSignatures can
predict the correct touched digits on average in almost 90% of the cases on
Nexus 5 and 80% of the cases on iPhone 5 in the third guess.
The high identiﬁcation rates prove the feasibility of the suggested attack
by TouchSignatures and show that it is practical for a remote attacker to
signiﬁcantly reduce the search space for the user’s PIN using JavaScript code.
5.5. Comparison with related works
In this section we compare the second phase of TouchSignatures, the iden-
tiﬁcation of PIN digits, with previous in-app sensor-based PIN identiﬁers.
Among the works described in Table 1, we choose to compare TouchSig-
natures with TouchLogger [8], and TapLogger [25], since they use similar
