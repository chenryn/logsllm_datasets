User: How to test and optimize the performance of the Linux system to improve the response speed and stability of the system?
Assistant: 1. Use the top or htop command to monitor system performance, check the usage of resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, and find high-load processes or services. 2. Use the vmstat command to view the virtual memory usage of the system, especially the usage of swap. 3. Use the iostat command to check the I/O status of the disk and find possible bottlenecks. 4. Use the sar command to collect system performance index data and analyze it to find possible problems. 5. Use the perf tool to analyze system performance, find out system bottlenecks, and optimize them. 6. Use techniques such as adjusting kernel parameters and file system parameters to optimize system performance. 7. Use resource limiting tools such as ulimit or cgroups to limit the use of system resources and avoid excessive resource occupation. 8. Use optimization tools such as systemd-sysusers, systemd-tmpfiles, systemd-journald, etc. to optimize the system.
