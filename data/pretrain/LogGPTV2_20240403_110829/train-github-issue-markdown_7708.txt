The example given for setting a life cycle event does not use a setter method
at:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/doctrine.html#lifecycle-callbacks
The current example is:
    /**
    * @ORM\PrePersist
     */
    public function setCreatedAtValue()
    {
        $this->createdAt = new \DateTime();
    }
I assume it should be something like the following (assuming that there is a
database column "createdAt" that has had getters and setters generated for it:
    /**
    * @ORM\PrePersist
     */
    public function setCreatedAtValue()
    {
        $this->setCreatedAt(new \DateTime());
    }
Having a "createdAt" DateTime field that does not get updated after the
initial submission is a common need, and it would be nice if it were more
thoroughly explained (including how to exclude it from display in a Twig
template). FWIW, I still can't get this to work right, so my suggestion may be
misguided or incomplete.
