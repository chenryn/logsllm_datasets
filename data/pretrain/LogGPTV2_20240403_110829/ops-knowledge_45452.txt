User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Set ntfs permissions so that a file can be read, but no browsing of the directory OK folks, I don't think this is possible, but:

Got a client who needs to allow domain users to read files in a directory.

The catch is, he does NOT want them to BROWSE the directory.

basically, they know a filename and a location, so they can open it directly. ( assume they will be pasting the entire path\filename into the file / open  dialog.

Is there any way to do this?

Additionally, they should not be able to see directory structure although this might be OK.

My feeling is to put all these files behind an application front-end, give permissions to the (web) app, and remove all direct domain user access to the files.  Utilize app security.

Other method suggestions are welcome.
I do not have full details of the application arch, but since it is all file based, I feel that a front-end needs to be written to handle this.  ( Note that I'm an application guy, not an admin.  I only play an admin on tv.....  I do know enough admin stuff to be extraordinarily dangerous, so no need to be TOO simplistic  )

Assistant: The problem with your setup (assuming I understand it correctly as "have all files in a single directory") is that a clever client can guess the filenames of other people, and gain access to their data, so it doesn't matter that they can't browse, it only matters that they can pick up any file by name, and that means other client's files.

In other words, obscurity does not imply security, only that it is out of sight, out of mind.  Someone with a little imagination will come along and see right through that.

I'd re-think the approach, and possibly isolate each client to a subdirectory that only they have permissions to.  You would then be able to isolate the client to that location only by sharing the client's specific directory level upwards...and they could browse all they want, because there is nothing else to see.  When they connect/log in, they only get access rights to "their directory"...it won't matter that there are other directories because they don't get access to them (lacking the correct privileges).
