User: Please list at least three common database types, and explain their characteristics and applicable scenarios.
Assistant: 1. Relational database (RDBMS) A relational database stores data in relational tables and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for management and manipulation. They model data for each table in a specific schema (a collection of columns in a table), organized around a set of primary and foreign keys. Relational databases are suitable for applications that need to support structured queries, such as financial, human resource, and inventory systems. 2. Object database (OODBMS) Object database is a very flexible database type, which stores data in the form of objects. Objects contain data and behavior (or methods) and enable developers to store and manipulate data in an object-oriented manner. Object-based databases are suitable for applications that need to support complex data models, such as CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing) and other engineering applications. 3. Document database (MongoDB) Document database uses JSON format to store data, which means that the data is very flexible and can be modified and queried more easily. Document databases also allow data to be stored as documents, which can contain other documents or arrays, thus supporting hierarchical and complex data models. Document databases are suitable for applications that need to process semi-structured and complex data, such as log analysis and content management systems.
