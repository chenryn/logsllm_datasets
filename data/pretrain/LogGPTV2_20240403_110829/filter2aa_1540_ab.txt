### Identifying and Analyzing Security Patches

#### Sources of Noise in Patch Analysis
- **Feature Updates**
- **Code Cleanup**
- **Refactoring**
- **Compiler Option Changes**
- **Compiler Changes**

#### Challenges in Identifying Security Patches
- **Not All Patches Are Security Patches**: Distinguishing security patches from other types of updates can be challenging.
- **Finding Needles in the Sand**: Locating security-relevant patches often requires sifting through a large number of changes.
- **Need for a Systematic Approach**: A method is needed to identify patches with significant security implications.

#### Using DarunGrim 3 for Security Implication Scoring
- **Script Interface**: DarunGrim 3 provides a script interface to its Diffing Engine.
- **Pattern Matching**: The tool includes a basic set of pattern-matching capabilities.
- **Security Implication Score Calculation**: This score is calculated using a Python interface, making it easy to extend as new patterns are discovered.
- **Extensibility**: Researchers can add new patterns as they become aware of them.

#### Examples of Vulnerability Classes
- **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (MS06-070)**
  - **Example**: MS06-070/_NetpManageIPCConnect@16
  - **Signatures**:
    - **String Length Checking Routines**: Functions like `strlen`, `wcslen`, `_mbslen`, and `_mbstrlen` are good indicators.
    - **Safe String Manipulation Functions**: Functions such as `StringCchCopyW` and Strsafe functions (e.g., `StringCbCat`, `StringCbCopy`) are also useful.
    - **Removal of Unsafe String Routines**: Functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `sprintf` being removed can indicate a buffer overflow patch.

- **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (Logic Error, MS08-067)**
  - **Example**: Conficker worm exploited this vulnerability.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Only two functions were changed.
    - One change was in the calling convention.
    - The other change was in the function with the vulnerability.

- **Integer Overflow (MS10-030)**
  - **Signatures**:
    - **Additional String to Integer Conversion Functions**: Functions like `ULongLongToULong`, `atoi`, `_wtoi`, and `StrToInt` can help check the sanity of integers derived from strings.
    - **Comparison Operations**: Additional `cmp` instructions can indicate integer overflow checks.

- **JRE Font Manager Buffer Overflow (Sun Alert 254571)**
  - **Original and Patched Code Comparison**:
    - **Original**: Code snippet showing the original vulnerable code.
    - **Patched**: Code snippet showing the additional checks added to prevent the overflow.

- **Insufficient Validation of Parameters (Java Deployment Toolkit)**
  - **Signatures**:
    - **Process Creation APIs**: Checking for the presence of APIs like `CreateProcess` in modified functions can help identify parameter validation issues.

- **Invalid Argument (MS09-020: WebDav Case)**
  - **Flags and Behavior Changes**:
    - **Flag 8**: Explanation of the `MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS` flag and its behavior across different Windows versions.
    - **Broken UTF8 Heuristics**: Code snippets showing the changes in the handling of UTF8 URLs.

- **Use-After-Free (CVE-2010-0249)**
  - **Vulnerability in Internet Explorer**:
    - **Unpatched and Patched Code**:
      - **Unpatched**: Code snippet showing the missing pointer replacement.
      - **Patched**: Code snippet showing the addition of `ReplacePtr` to fix the issue.
    - **Signatures**:
      - **Pointer Replacement**: The presence of `ReplacePtr` can indicate a use-after-free bug fix.

### Conclusion
- **Benefits of Binary Diffing**:
  - **IPS Rule Writers and Security Researchers**: Binary diffing can aid in identifying and analyzing security vulnerabilities.
  - **Further Binary Auditing**: Locating security vulnerabilities in binaries can facilitate more detailed audits.
  - **Typical Patterns in Patches**: Different bug classes have characteristic patterns that can be identified.
- **Security Implication Score by DarunGrim 3**:
  - **Customizable Logic**: The scoring logic is written in Python and can be customized as needed.
