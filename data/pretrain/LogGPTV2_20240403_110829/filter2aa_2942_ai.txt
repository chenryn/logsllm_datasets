Key Takeaways34 
C-SCRM in Acquisition. Th eintegration of C-SCRM into acquisition activities is critical to the 
success of any C-SCRM program. C-SCRM requirements should be embedded throughout the 
acquisition life cycle. The C-SCRM activities include performing risk assessments of services, 
suppliers, and products; identifying relevant C-SCRM controls; conducting due diligence; and 
continuously monitoring suppliers.  
Supply Chain Information Sharing. Enterprises will gain access to information critical to 
understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain by building 
information-sharing processes and activities into C-SCRM programs. Enterprises should engage 
with peers, business partners, suppliers, and information-sharing communities (e.g., ISACs) to 
gain insight into cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and learn from the experiences 
of the community at large.  
C-SCRM Awareness and Training. Enterprises should adopt enterprise-wide and role-based 
training programs to educate users on the potential impact that cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain can have on the business and how to adopt best practices for risk mitigation. Robust 
C-SCRM training is a key enabler for enterprises as they shift toward a C-SCRM-aware culture.  
C-SCRM Key Practices. This publication outlines several Foundational, Sustaining, and 
Enabling C-SCRM practices that enterprises should adopt and tailor to their unique contexts. 
Enterprises should prioritize reaching a base level of maturity in key practices before focusing on 
advanced C-SCRM capabilities.  
Capability Implementation Measurement and C-SCRM Measures. Enterprises should 
actively manage the efficiency and effectiveness of their C-SCRM programs. First, enterprises 
should adopt a C-SCRM framework as the basis for measuring their progress toward C-SCRM 
objectives. Next, enterprises should create and implement quantitative performance measures 
and target tolerance that provide a periodic glimpse into the enterprise’s progress through the 
lens of specific operational objectives.  
Dedicated Resources. Where possible and applicable, enterprises should commit dedicated 
funds to C-SCRM. The benefits of doing so include facilitating strategic and goal-oriented 
planning, driving accountability of internal stakeholders to execute and mature the C-SCRM 
practices of the enterprise, and the continuous monitoring of progress by enterprise leadership.

APPENDIX A: C-SCRM SECURITY CONTROLS 35 
C-SCRM CONTROLS INTRODUCTION 
NIST defines security controls as: 
The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or 
countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [FIPS 
199] 
[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] defines numerous cybersecurity supply chain-related controls within 
the catalog of information security controls. This section is structured as an enhanced overlay of 
[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. It identifies and augments C-SCRM-related controls with additional 
supplemental guidance and provides new controls as appropriate. The C-SCRM controls are 
organized into the 20 control families of [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. This approach facilitates use 
of the security controls assessment techniques articulated in [NIST SP 800-53A, Rev. 5] to 
assess implementation of C-SCRM controls. 
The controls provided in this publication are intended for enterprises to implement internally and 
to require of their contractors and subcontractors if and when applicable and as articulated in a 
contractual agreement. As with [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5], the security controls and control 
enhancements are a starting point from which controls/enhancements may be removed, added, or 
specialized based on an enterprise’s needs. Each control in this section is listed for its 
applicability to C-SCRM. Those controls from [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] not listed are not 
considered directly applicable to C-SCRM and, thus, are not included in this publication. Details 
and supplemental guidance for the various C-SCRM controls in this publication are contained in 
Section 4.5. 
C-SCRM CONTROLS SUMMARY 
During the Respond step of the risk management process articulated in Section 2, enterprises 
select, tailor, and implement controls for mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain. [NIST 800-53B] lists a set of information security controls at the [FIPS 199] high-, 
moderate-, and low-impact levels. This section describes how these controls help mitigate risk to 
information systems and components, as well as the supply chain infrastructure. The section 
provides 20 C-SCRM control families that include relevant controls and supplemental guidance.  
Figure A-1 depicts the process used to identify, refine, and add C-SCRM supplemental guidance 
to the [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] C-SCRM-related controls and represents the following steps: 
1. Select and extract individual controls and enhancements from [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] 
applicable to C-SCRM. 
2. Analyze these controls to determine how they apply to C-SCRM. 
35 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.

3. Evaluate the resulting set of controls and enhancements to determine whether all C-
SCRM concerns were addressed. 
4. Develop additional controls currently undefined in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5]. 
5. Identify controls for flow down to relevant sub-level contractors. 
6. Assign applicable levels to each C-SCRM control. 
7. Develop C-SCRM-specific supplemental guidance for each C-SCRM control. 
Fig. A-1: C-SCRM Security Controls in NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1 
Note that [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] provides C-SCRM-related controls and control families. 
These controls may be listed in this publication with a summary or additional guidance and a 
reference to the original [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] control and supplemental guidance detail. 
C-SCRM CONTROLS THROUGHOUT THE ENTERPRISE  
As noted in Table A-1, C-SCRM controls in this publication are designated by the three levels 
comprising the enterprise. This is to facilitate the selection of C-SCRM controls specific to 
enterprises, their various missions, and individual systems, as described in Appendix C under the 
Respond step of the risk management process. During controls selection, enterprises should use 
the C-SCRM controls in this section to identify appropriate C-SCRM controls for tailoring per 
risk assessment. By selecting and implementing applicable C-SCRM controls for each level, 
enterprises will ensure that they have appropriately addressed C-SCRM. 
APPLYING C-SCRM CONTROLS TO ACQUIRING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
Acquirers may use C-SCRM controls as the basis from which to communicate their C-SCRM 
requirements to different types of enterprises that provide products and services to acquirers, 
including suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers. Acquirers should avoid using generalized requirements 
statements, such as “ensure compliance with NIST SP 800-161, Rev. 1 controls.” Acquirers must 
be careful to select the controls relevant to the specific use case of the service or product being 
acquired. Acquirers are encouraged to integrate C-SCRM throughout their acquisition activities. 
More detail on the role of C-SCRM in acquisition is provided in Section 3.1 of this document.
