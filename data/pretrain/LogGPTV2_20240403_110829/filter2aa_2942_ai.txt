### Key Takeaways

1. **C-SCRM in Acquisition:**
   - Integrating Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) into acquisition activities is essential for the success of any C-SCRM program.
   - C-SCRM requirements should be embedded throughout the acquisition lifecycle, including performing risk assessments of services, suppliers, and products; identifying relevant C-SCRM controls; conducting due diligence; and continuously monitoring suppliers.

2. **Supply Chain Information Sharing:**
   - Enterprises can gain access to critical information for understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks by incorporating information-sharing processes and activities into their C-SCRM programs.
   - Engaging with peers, business partners, suppliers, and information-sharing communities (e.g., ISACs) provides valuable insights into cybersecurity risks and best practices.

3. **C-SCRM Awareness and Training:**
   - Enterprises should implement enterprise-wide and role-based training programs to educate users on the potential impact of cybersecurity risks in the supply chain and how to adopt best practices for risk mitigation.
   - Robust C-SCRM training is crucial for fostering a C-SCRM-aware culture within the organization.

4. **C-SCRM Key Practices:**
   - This publication outlines foundational, sustaining, and enabling C-SCRM practices that enterprises should adopt and tailor to their unique contexts.
   - Enterprises should prioritize achieving a base level of maturity in key practices before focusing on advanced C-SCRM capabilities.

5. **Capability Implementation Measurement and C-SCRM Measures:**
   - Enterprises should actively manage the efficiency and effectiveness of their C-SCRM programs.
   - Adopting a C-SCRM framework as the basis for measuring progress, creating and implementing quantitative performance measures, and setting target tolerances are essential steps.

6. **Dedicated Resources:**
   - Where possible and applicable, enterprises should allocate dedicated funds to C-SCRM.
   - Benefits include facilitating strategic and goal-oriented planning, driving accountability among internal stakeholders, and continuous monitoring of progress by enterprise leadership.

### Appendix A: C-SCRM Security Controls

#### Introduction
NIST defines security controls as:
- The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [FIPS 199]

[NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] defines numerous cybersecurity supply chain-related controls within the catalog of information security controls. This section provides an enhanced overlay of [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5], identifying and augmenting C-SCRM-related controls with additional supplemental guidance and new controls as needed. The C-SCRM controls are organized into the 20 control families of [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5].

#### Summary
During the Respond step of the risk management process, enterprises select, tailor, and implement controls for mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. [NIST 800-53B] lists a set of information security controls at the [FIPS 199] high-, moderate-, and low-impact levels. This section describes how these controls help mitigate risk to information systems and components, as well as the supply chain infrastructure.

#### Process
Figure A-1 depicts the process used to identify, refine, and add C-SCRM supplemental guidance to the [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] C-SCRM-related controls, involving the following steps:
1. Select and extract individual controls and enhancements from [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5] applicable to C-SCRM.
2. Analyze these controls to determine how they apply to C-SCRM.
3. Evaluate the resulting set of controls and enhancements to determine whether all C-SCRM concerns were addressed.
4. Develop additional controls currently undefined in [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5].
5. Identify controls for flow down to relevant sub-level contractors.
6. Assign applicable levels to each C-SCRM control.
7. Develop C-SCRM-specific supplemental guidance for each C-SCRM control.

#### Applying C-SCRM Controls to Acquiring Products and Services
Acquirers may use C-SCRM controls as the basis for communicating their C-SCRM requirements to different types of enterprises, including suppliers, developers, system integrators, and external service providers. Acquirers should avoid using generalized requirements statements and instead select controls relevant to the specific use case of the service or product being acquired. More detail on the role of C-SCRM in acquisition is provided in Section 3.1 of this document.
