### Additional Information
Is there a reason anyone suspects this wouldn't work? I reviewed the changelog
meticulously but I don't see anything that seems relevant in either 5.x or
6.x. I see the sandbox is enabled by default, but it seems to only apply to
the `renderer` processes and not the `main` as far as I can tell. Currently I
haven't a clue what the cause could be, but if any Electron Team dev or anyone
else could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it hugely.
