Query PI:EMAIL using custom email tools
In your digital notebook, create a new section and title it logically based on the date of request, incident type, or 
case number if there is one. For example, "OSINT Request Octl3_2019” or "Robbery 19-486544". Any emails 
or other written correspondence received leading into the case should be copied into your digital notebook. 
Finally, before moving on, ask yourself if OSINT is the right tool for the job. I have made the mistake of 
investing hours into online searches, only to realize later that a two-minute phone call would have likely given 
me the same information. Do not make the mistake of overlooking traditional investigative resources. Would a 
phone call to a postal inspector identify the occupants of a residence quicker than an online search? The 
strongest investigators are ones who think outside the box while also using every tool in it
• 
Check the status of your VPN on your host machine. If not already connected, join a 
geographical area close to where you believe the target is located.
• 
Start VirtualBox and load your custom OSINT virtual machine.

If you are using a Windows-based digital notebook, such as OneNote, you will need to swatch back to 
your host environment (Windows) when adding content to that notebook. In the next chapter we will 
look at a Linux compatible notebook that has some of OneNote's desired functionality.
Now that you have established a plan and a clear understanding of the mission goals, you need to prepare your 
workspace for the investigation. "Knolling" is the process of organizing your resources so they are ready to go 
and easily accessible once you start the actual work. Think of how a surgeon's instruments are sanitized and laid 
out in an organized fashion. The time spent preparing up front will result in a more efficient overall operation 
while also reducing the chances of unnecessary mishaps. If you followed the instructions and recommendations 
in previous chapters, you should already have a custom Linux VM. It should be patched and preloaded with 
your preferred OSINT applications. Additional recommended preparations prior to the search phase include 
the following.
undercover investigators. This is not only a waste of time and focus, but can complicate the individual cases 
where they overlap. If nothing else, ask the person for whom you are doing the work if anyone else is working 
on the case. You would be surprised how often two branches of the same agency are unknowingly pursuing a 
common target.
The triage stage is the appropriate time to begin your note-taking. I will discuss specific tools in the next chapter, 
but at its core you will need a paper scratch pad and digital notebook, such as Microsoft OneNote. A paper 
notepad allows for quickly noting key details without having to move out of your browser during searches. This 
is even more crucial if you are on a laptop or otherwise have limited screen real estate with which to work. Your 
digital note-taking application is for pasting content as you copy it from your browser. Keep in mind using 
Microsoft products allows them to collect user information, so make sure that this is within the operational 
security requirements of your organization. At the top of your legal pad, list out the details you are trying to find 
and any initial investigative steps. This does not need to include extreme details, but it establishes your plan.
Closed-Source & Premium Data
464 Chapter 29
Begin rhe research phase of the 
proprietary data sources. This includes
• 
Commercial aggregators such as Accurint (LexisNexis), TLO, Clear, or others.
• 
Premium products such as BeenVerified, Intelius, Spokeo, Pipl, and WhitepagesPro.
• 
Government and LE databases such as Department of Licensing, Criminal Records, Department of 
Corrections, and Agency Records Management Systems.
Whereas using purely open-source tools typically requires visiting dozens of sites in order to find just a few 
leads, paid sendees often quickly provide a list of possible addresses, associates, and accounts. If you have 
sendees like LexisNexus or Clear available, use them early for easy additional leads on your target. These sendees 
obtain much of their data from credit histories and utilities. Therefore, they tend to be good sources for 
residential address history, land-line phone numbers, employers, roommates, and family members. They tend to 
work very poorly with email addresses, usernames, and social media accounts.
You should now be ready with all your tools and note-taking resources, 
investigation by querying your target against any in-house, premium, or 
any of the following.
Your knolling is complete. You have a virtual machine preloaded with the most useful OSINT tools, and you 
are on a secure and private connection. We are prepared to search quickly, collect pertinent content, store it 
logically, and track our progress within our notes.
This is also when you should run any premium people-search services such as Pipl, Spokeo, or BeenVerified. 
These types of services range from S15-S3OO a month depending on the subscription tier, but tend to offer a 
much richer, immediate return on queries than their free counterparts. Although Pipl Pro formerly offered some 
of the best premium results, they are also one of the most expensive. Additionally, they have moved to a complex 
per-record pricing model. Spokeo is one of the cheapest at $15-520 a month depending on your plan, but they 
have a modest amount of data for a paid service and charge extra to make reports easily printable. BeenVerified 
allows you to run an unlimited number of fairly extensive reports for 553 quarterly and they are print friendly. 
However, they will push you to spend more money for "premium" data about your target. Many investigators 
kickstart the early stages of their open source investigations using one of these cheap premium aggregators, but

Once in your OSINT VM, run your browser by selecting it from your Dock bar on the left or from the 
application window which is accessed by clicking on the square-shaped set of nine dots at the bottom 
of the Dock.
• 
If you have not already done so, log in to your covert social network accounts used for OSINT research. 
We will likely need to conduct searches on these platforms and pre-authendcating in this browser 
session will save us time later.
• 
If you need to make new covert social media accounts for research, you should disconnect from your 
VPN prior to doing so. It should also be noted that running several queries on freshly made accounts 
is highly likely to result in security challenges and/or suspended accounts. Tty to always have a supply 
of semi-mature accounts available for time-sensitive investigations.
• 
Open the custom OSINT tools which you built in previous chapters of this book.
• 
Create a new folder in the shared directory of your VM and rename it to match your digital notebook 
including date, target name, or case number. This is where we will store any manually captured digital 
evidence such as saved images or pdf captures. 1 keep a directory in my Original VM that is prepopulatcd 
with folders titled to reflect my custom tools. This gives me an organized destination for anything I 
recover and saves me from having to repeat this step every time I open a new case. Figure 29.01 displays 
an example of this, and die digital templates download contains the same structure which can be copied 
if desired.

such as the email and search engine tools.
Once you have exhausted your in-house and paid data resources, it is time to dive into your OS1NT tools and 
resources. This tends to be the most involved stage of research due to the large number of sites that you will 
check for your target's information. Tab management is critical in staying organized. If you have not already 
done so, add the OneTab (one-tab.com) extension to Chrome and Firefox within your VM.
Any promising identifiers from your premium or government searches should be added to your notepad, and 
generated reports should be dropped into your digital notebook as pdfs. Photos can be copied and pasted into 
your digital notes or dropped into your designated director}' within the shared folder on your desktop. This 
reflects our workflow going forward. Any valuable page, image, or identifier is noted, and a corresponding pdf 
or image capture is placed either in our digital notebook or investigative folder.
For those on the government or law enforcement side of the house, internal agency records systems, department 
of licensing requests, and criminal history queries can be very' powerful additions to your early’ digging. An 
advantage that government investigators have is that many’ of these systems will provide access to a photo of 
the target, which can be used to verify or rule out possible social media accounts. These records also typically’ 
include recent associates, phone numbers, and residential addresses. Even if the subject did not use their own

• Perform any additional queries on sites not included in your custom toolset. For example, a colleague 
may have very recently recommended a new email search site. If that resource provides good results, 
consider adding it to your custom toolset.
At this point, you should be in your VM looking at several open tabs in your browser. These tabs represent the 
results from the Google and custom tools queries which you have executed. The rule going forward is to deal 
with each tab completely, and intentionally keep or discard it before moving on to the next. A common misstep 
is to start clicking on leads that look interesting prior to completely reviewing the page on which you are currently 
visiting. Therefore, tab discipline should be in the forefront of your mind as you parse through your first batch 
of search results. Consider the following.
• 
Review the first tab of Google results, looking for anything that stands out as a likely valid lead on your 
target For any results that look promising, right-click die link and choose "Open link in new tab".
• 
Continue to scroll through the first page of Google results and when you get to the image results, right­
click on it and choose "Open link in new tab". If Google does not include an "Images for..." section 
in the first page of results, you may need to select "Images" from the tabs at the top of the page. The 
image results are always worth reviewing as you can quickly scan the page for potential profile images 
or other photos of your target
• 
Once you are satisfied that you have fully reviewed the first page of Google results and have opened 
any promising leads in their own tabs, you can move on to the next tab.
• 
As you start to do more OS1NT work, small efficiencies compound to save a lot of time in the overall 
investigation. Learning keyboard commands for frequendy used browser actions will be very beneficial. 
In this case, you can press "Ctrl" + "tab" (Windows) or "command" + "tab" (Mac) to move to the next 
tab to the right. Holding down "Shift" with the previous key combinations will cycle through tabs in 
the opposite direction, from right to left.
As you move through your tabbed results methodically, you may come upon a page of results which is a jackpot 
of links to potential target data. This is a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless. The same rules 
apply, but with one additional recommendation, which is that any lead that warrants its own full set of queries 
should be opened in a new window rather than a new tab. Consider the following example.
This OneNote digital notebook is logically structured to organize intelligence leads as they are uncovered. The 
notebook tide on the top left reflects the case number and name of the target organization. I should mention 
that this example was chosen arbitrarily, and the group depicted is not likely criminal in nature. I have tabbed 
sections for the target individual and the organization. I also have a tab which contains fresh copies of my
This system of exhausting leads on the current page before moving on to other tabs is crucial in ensuring that 
you do not overlook potential intelligence or lose your way by moving too quickly from lead to lead. That is 
called "rabbit holing" and is the biggest pitfall with which new investigators inevitably struggle. You also need 
to be disciplined about closing any tabs that are false positives or otherwise present no fruitful results. This will 
help to control browser clutter and reduce the load on your workstation resources.
• 
You have located a social media account containing several strong leads which require their own 
set of queries using Google and your custom OSINT tools.
• 
The Twitter usernames need to be queried through the Twitter tools and the email addresses through 
the email tools. Think of each of these as a new path that needs to be followed independently.
• 
Any strong leads should be represented in your notes. Write down any account identifiers on your legal 
pad, and for each create a new page in your digital notebook. Figure 29.02 displays the documentation 
in OneNote.

Left-click and drag your mouse to highlight your set of URLs. Press "Ctrl” + "C" (Windows) or 
"command" + "C" (Mac) to copy the list.
Move to your digital notebook, select the appropriate page, and press "Ctrl" + "V" (Windows) or 
"command" + "V" (Mac) to paste the list into your notes. Figure 29.04 displays this content within 
OneNote.
The list of tabs is saved locally in your VM within your browser extension data, but you will want it in your notes 
for easy access. Click on "Export/lmport URLs" on the top right of the page. Figure 29.03 displays an example. 
The export page is missing titles, but each set is separated by a space and the URLs are in the same order as the 
lists on the OneTab management page. Consider the following steps.
When you reach the last open tab in your current search, look back and make certain that any open tabs are 
pages that have useful data. Prior to moving on to a new window and path of inquiry', you should preserve your 
list of tabs. This is where your tab manager can be beneficial. OneTab's primary' purpose is its ability' to quickly 
collapse all tabs into an exportable list of URLs. These bookmarks can then be pasted into your notes or shared 
with a colleague who can import them into their own OneNote instance. Once you are finished working with 
any set of tabs, conduct the following.
• 
Right-click anywhere in the window, select the blue OneTab icon, and click "Send all tabs to OneTab".
• 
You will now be looking at the OneTab manager, which was explained in Chapter Three. The list of 
bookmarks for the tabs you just collapsed will be at the top of the list.
• 
Click in front of the number of tabs to add a title, such as "Google Target Name". Logical naming is 
the cornerstone of staying organized and making your work searchable. Eventually this set of 
bookmarks will get pushed farther down the page as you add newer tab sets. To find it again, press 
"Ctrl" + "F" (Windows) or "command" + "F" (Mac) to conduct a keyword search for the custom title 
you added.
Although OneTab is the tab manager I recommend for most people, if you require online sync or advanced 
features, some other tab extensions are Toby, Tabs-Outliner, Workona, and Graphitabs. As discussed earlier in 
this book, extensions always come with a security cost, so use them sparingly and only when the added 
functionality is mission critical.
OS1NT templates should I need them. The visible section represents a "real-name" investigation into my primary’ 
target. On the right, I have added pages that reflect each strong lead, which was created for each account 
identifier. This ensures that every' new investigative path I open has a place to paste relevant data, while also 
making it easier to visualize my leads as a whole. The following explains some of the options present in Figure 
29.02.
Strong leads are given a new browser window and their own page in my digital notebook. This ensures that 
every new investigative path 1 open has a place to paste relevant data while also making it easier to visualize my 
leads as a whole. The list of pages can also be used as a check or "to-do" list. Once you have fully exhausted that 
lead, you can add a + symbol to the title to indicate that it is complete, as seen in my example.
