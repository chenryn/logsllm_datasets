### Optimized Text

#### Query PI:EMAIL Using Custom Email Tools
1. In your digital notebook, create a new section and title it logically based on the date of the request, incident type, or case number if available. For example, "OSINT Request Oct13_2019" or "Robbery 19-486544".
2. Copy any emails or other written correspondence received into your digital notebook.
3. Before proceeding, evaluate whether OSINT is the most appropriate tool for the job. Traditional investigative methods, such as a phone call to a postal inspector, may sometimes provide the necessary information more efficiently.

#### Check Your VPN Connection
1. Verify the status of your VPN on your host machine.
2. If not already connected, connect to a geographical area close to where you believe the target is located.

#### Start VirtualBox and Load Your Custom OSINT VM
1. Launch VirtualBox and load your custom OSINT virtual machine.
2. If using a Windows-based digital notebook like OneNote, switch back to your host environment (Windows) when adding content to the notebook.
3. In the next chapter, we will explore a Linux-compatible notebook with some of OneNote's desired functionality.

#### Prepare Your Workspace
1. **Knolling**: Organize your resources so they are ready to go and easily accessible. This preparation is crucial for efficiency and reducing mishaps.
2. Ensure you have a custom Linux VM patched and preloaded with your preferred OSINT applications.
3. Additional recommended preparations include:
   - Confirming that no other investigators are working on the same case to avoid duplication of effort.
   - Setting up a paper scratch pad and a digital notebook (e.g., Microsoft OneNote) for note-taking.
   - At the top of your legal pad, list the details you are trying to find and any initial investigative steps.

#### Closed-Source & Premium Data
1. Begin the research phase by accessing proprietary data sources, including:
   - Commercial aggregators: Accurint (LexisNexis), TLO, Clear, etc.
   - Premium products: BeenVerified, Intelius, Spokeo, Pipl, WhitepagesPro.
   - Government and LE databases: Department of Licensing, Criminal Records, Department of Corrections, Agency Records Management Systems.
2. Paid services often provide quick leads on possible addresses, associates, and accounts. Use these services early in your investigation for additional leads.

#### Conduct the Investigation
1. **Query Your Target**:
   - Use in-house, premium, or government databases.
   - Run premium people-search services like Pipl, Spokeo, or BeenVerified.
   - Consider the cost and value of each service, such as Pipl Pro, which offers extensive results but at a higher price.
2. **Use OSINT Tools**:
   - In your OSINT VM, run your browser and log in to covert social network accounts.
   - Create a new folder in the shared directory of your VM, named to match your digital notebook (including date, target name, or case number).
   - Store manually captured digital evidence, such as saved images or PDFs, in this folder.
   - Use a digital notebook that accepts multimedia file types for storing files within your notes.

#### Open-Source Research & Collection
1. **Google Search**:
   - Conduct a quick Google search on your known identifiers.
   - Use custom OSINT tools, such as email and search engine tools, to further your investigation.
2. **Tab Management**:
   - Add the OneTab extension to Chrome and Firefox within your VM for better tab management.
   - Review and fully process each tab before moving on to the next.
   - Use keyboard commands for efficient navigation between tabs.
3. **Document Leads**:
   - Add promising identifiers from premium or government searches to your notepad.
   - Generate reports and store them as PDFs in your digital notebook.
   - Copy and paste photos into your digital notes or store them in the designated directory on your desktop.

#### Tab Management and Workflow
1. **OneTab Extension**:
   - Use OneTab to collapse all tabs into an exportable list of URLs.
   - Add logical titles to your sets of bookmarks for easy organization.
   - Save and share your list of tabs for future reference or collaboration.
2. **Context-Based Search**:
   - Use context search extensions like ContextSearch for quick and convenient queries.
   - Customize your search strings via the options menu by adding structured URLs.

By following these steps, you will be well-prepared to conduct a thorough and efficient open-source intelligence investigation.
