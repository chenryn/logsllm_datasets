### Analysis of Tor Exit Policies and Network Traffic

To gain an accurate view of the Tor network traffic, we conducted an analysis of the exit policies used by Tor exit relays. By analyzing multiple consensus documents produced in April 2016, we found that all 219 ports rejected in Tor's default exit policy (most of which are related to file-sharing) were the most frequently rejected ports in the Tor network. We also discovered that similar fractions of exit bandwidth are available for several of the ports that are blocked by default.

#### Table 5: Ports Considered for Exploratory Measurements

| Traffic Type | Label | Ports |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| HTTP/S       | web   | 80, 443 |
| BitTorrent Base | btb | [6881-6889] |
| BitTorrent Extended | bte | [6890-6999] |
| Other File-Sharing | ofs | 1214, [4661-4666], [6346-6429], 6699 |
| Various      | var   | 25, 119, [135-139], 445, 563 |

#### Table 6: Policies Considered for Exploratory Measurements and Weighted Exit Bandwidth Supporting Each Policy

| Name  | Policy by Label (see Table 5) | Exit BW (%) |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Strict | reject web, btb, bte, ofs, var | 14          |
| Default | accept web; reject btb, bte, ofs, var | 68          |
| FS     | accept web, ofs; reject btb, bte, var | 3.7         |
| FS+    | accept web, bte, ofs; reject btb, var | 2.7         |
| FS++   | accept web, btb, bte, ofs; reject var | 9.9         |
| Open   | accept web, btb, bte, ofs, var | 1.1         |

We further analyzed the combinations of port groups in Table 5 to understand which ports are accepted or rejected by each relay. We computed the percentage of exit relays, weighted by their probability of selection in the exit position, that accepted or rejected each group of ports. Out of the 2^5 = 32 possible combinations, only 7 were valid (i.e., at least one exit matched the policy). Table 6 lists the top 6 policies and the percentage of exit bandwidth that supported each policy (the remaining valid exit policy was supported by less than 0.1% of exit bandwidth).

Our findings indicate that the default policy is the most popular, supported by 68% of relays and allowing exit to the 65,315 most allowed ports. Additionally, 17% of exits support some of the ports commonly associated with file-sharing, even though these ports are among the least allowed. Over 14% of exit bandwidth does not support exiting to the HTTP/S ports 80 and 443, despite being the most allowed traffic type in Tor.

### 5.2 Exploratory Measurements

We first discuss the measurement results collected with our PrivCount deployment before describing how to use them to infer full Tor network statistics.

#### Results

Our primary measurement results related to traffic distribution are shown in Figure 3. 

- **Figure 3a** shows the total number of active circuits (circuits with at least one completed stream) as counted by our exit relays over 24-hour collection intervals, classified by PrivCount.
- **Figure 3b** shows the number of streams (TCP connections that exit the Tor network) observed by our exit relays.
- **Figure 3c** shows the sum of the amount of data transferred in both directions on those streams.

The collected measurement results for each of the exit policies from Table 6 are shown with 95% confidence intervals that account for the noise added to each counter.

Across all six exit policies and all three statistics shown in Figure 3, we observed very low counts for Interactive traffic relative to Web or Other traffic. This indicates that Interactive traffic is a minor part of Tor’s overall traffic distribution and can be safely ignored during later measurement periods.

We also observed that the number of circuits (Figure 3a) and the number of streams (Figure 3b) for the Web class remained relatively consistent across all exit policies, except for the strict policy. The number of streams showed some fluctuation among exit policies, attributed to the large error bounds for the Web class. Note that the strict exit policy does not allow traffic that would have been classified as Web, so the positive counts for Web under the strict policy in Figure 3 correspond directly to the noise added to those counters by PrivCount.

Although Web circuits and streams remain relatively consistent across exit policies, Other circuits and streams do not. The number of observed Other circuits (Figure 3a) increases dramatically and somewhat sporadically when using exit policies that allow exiting to file-sharing ports. The number of observed Other streams (Figure 3b) similarly increases, and the number of streams trends higher as less restrictive exit policies are used (and therefore more file-sharing ports are allowed). These observations follow common traffic patterns of file-sharing protocols, which tend to create many connections with their peers to decrease download times for large files.

Similar to the circuit and stream count trends, we observed that the amount of Other stream data transferred on connections exiting Tor (Figure 3c) also increases significantly as the number of file-sharing ports that our exit relays allow increases. However, unlike the Web circuit and stream counts (which are mostly unaffected by the increase in Other circuits and streams), the amount of Web data transferred decreases as the amount of Other data transferred increases. This suggests a crowding-out situation, where each traffic class competes for the limited bandwidth of our exit relays, and file-sharing traffic wins the competition. The number of Web circuits (Figure 3a) and streams (Figure 3b) remains consistent even when the amount of transferred Web data (Figure 3c) decreases, indicating that the performance for the web streams that coexist with file-sharing streams may be significantly reduced. If this hypothesis holds true, users could potentially improve their web browsing experience by excluding those exit relays that allow file-sharing ports in their exit policies when building circuits. This presents an interesting area for future work.

Finally, we observed that restricting Web traffic from exiting our relays using the strict policy did not result in a dramatic increase in circuits, streams, or data transferred for either the Interactive or Other classes. This increases our confidence that there are not other ports whose activity is crowded out by the activity associated with the Web ports.

#### Inferring Network Totals

Our results from the exploratory phase improve our understanding of how traffic characteristics vary with different exit policies. However, the results can be misleading when compared directly without accounting for the relative exit bandwidth support available for each exit policy type. Accounting for the popularity of each exit policy used during measurement will provide a better estimate of the overall traffic characteristics over the entire Tor network.

We collected 24 consensus files (one for each hour) produced during each of the 6 exploratory measurement rounds (24 * 6 = 144 files total). For each set of 24 files, corresponding to a single exit policy and a collection of measurement results, we computed the mean fractional weight for selecting our relays in the entry position (Wg), the mean fractional weight for selecting our relays in the exit position (We), and the mean fractional weight of other relays supporting the exit policy used during that collection phase (Wp). We then scaled our measured entry statistics by Wp/Wg and our measured exit statistics by Wp/We, and summed the scaled results from all phases to produce a final network total estimate.

#### Table 7: 10-Minute Mean Tor Network Activity Inferred from Exploratory Measurements

| Traffic Class | Stream Data (GiB) | Streams (×10^3) | Active Circuits (×10^3) |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Interactive   | 1,200 (100%) ±500 (42%) | 17,000 (100%) ±4,000 (24%) | 1,100 (100%) ±300 (27%) |
| Web           | 640 (53%) ±80 (13%) | 15,000 (88%) ±4,000 (27%) | 1,000 (91%) ±300 (30%) |
| Other         | 580 (48%) ±50 (9%) | 1,900 (11%) ±200 (11%) | 260 (24%) ±40 (15%) |

Note that for the statistics that don’t sum to 100%, the percentages shown in the table are calculated using a separate, single total count that we collected (e.g., total active circuits) rather than a sum of the three class-specific individual counts. This was done to avoid aggregating noise and improve the accuracy of the estimate where possible. The confidence intervals include the uncertainty associated with the noise added to the counters as well as the sampling error.

As with our direct measurements, our inference indicates that Interactive traffic is a minor contributor to the overall inferred activity on Tor. Our inference also indicates that Web traffic is the dominant type of traffic seen on the network for all three statistics shown in the table. Specifically, we found that Web traffic accounts for 88% of the streams created in Tor and 91% of the stream data. A comparison to previous measurement studies is given in Table 8. Overall, our results indicate that HTTP/S usage has increased since 2010 relative to other protocols, which we suggest is due to usability improvements in browsing the web with Tor (e.g., Tor Browser).

### 5.3 In-Depth Measurements

We present the results from our in-depth rounds as inferred Tor network totals that we computed by adjusting each entry and exit statistic by our mean entry and exit probability, respectively. Note that the inferences based on exit statistics assume that relays using non-default exit policies observe traffic characteristics similar to those observed while using the default policy. Future work should consider taking these measurements with different exit policies (e.g., that allow or partially allow file-sharing ports).

#### Entry Statistics

The entry statistics that we collected focused on counting the number of observed unique clients and the number of those clients that were active and inactive.

#### Table 9: 10-Minute Mean Tor Network Activity Inferred from Single-Counter In-Depth Entry Statistics

| Statistic | Unique Clients (×10^3) | Client Conns (×10^3) |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Count     | 710 (100%) ±85 (12%)   | 560 (100%) ±60 (11%) |
| Active    | 550 (77%) ±70 (13%)    | -                    |
| Inactive  | 140 (20%) ±30 (21%)    | -                    |

#### Table 10: 10-Minute Mean Tor Network Activity Inferred from Single-Counter In-Depth Exit Statistics

| Statistic | Active Circuits (×10^3) | Streams (×10^3) | Stream Data (GiB) |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Web       | 1,400 (100%) ±200 (14%)  | 1,600 (11%) ±200 (15%) | 15,000 (100%) ±3,000 (20%) |
| Other     | 700 (50%) ±50 (7%)       | 1,300 (100%) ±100 (8%)  | 17,000 (113%) ±3,000 (18%) |
| Inactive  | 680 (49%) ±100 (8%)      | -                | -                  |

These in-depth measurements provide a more detailed view of the Tor network's traffic patterns and help us better understand the impact of different exit policies on network performance.
