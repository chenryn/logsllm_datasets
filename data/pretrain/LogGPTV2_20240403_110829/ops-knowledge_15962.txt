A few days after uninstalling Python 3.4.2, I had to perform a system restore on my Windows 7 machine due to the accidental installation of several unwanted programs that were causing issues even after being uninstalled. The system restore inadvertently "reinstalled" a broken version of Python. Now, I am unable to uninstall it using the standard method via Control Panel > Uninstall Programs, and I also cannot reinstall it using the original installer. Unfortunately, there are no earlier system snapshots available for restoration.

Both the uninstall and reinstall processes make some progress before stopping with the following error message: "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your support personnel or package vendor."

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might successfully complete the uninstallation?

**Suggested Solution:**

1. **Delete the Python Directory:**
   - Manually delete the `C:\Python34\` directory. This will remove the core files and folders associated with Python 3.4.2.

2. **Reinstall Python 3.4:**
   - Download and install any sub-version of Python 3.4 (it doesn't matter which one, as long as it is within the 3.4 series). This step is necessary to obtain a fresh uninstaller that can properly remove the registry keys created during the initial installation.

3. **Uninstall Python 3.4:**
   - Use the newly installed Python 3.4's uninstaller to completely remove the Python installation. This should clean up any remaining registry entries and other system configurations.

Python is largely self-contained within the `Python34` directory, so removing this directory and then using a fresh uninstaller should resolve the issue.
