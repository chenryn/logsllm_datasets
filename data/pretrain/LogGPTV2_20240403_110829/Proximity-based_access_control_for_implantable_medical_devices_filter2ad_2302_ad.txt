### Security Approaches for Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs)

#### Token-Based Approaches
Token-based approaches [22] involve providing patients with an access token (e.g., USB stick, smart card) configured with a shared credential (often a secret key) between the token and the IMD. When a doctor needs to access the IMD, they obtain the token from the patient and use it to establish a secure link for data transfer or programming commands.

**Drawbacks**:
- Vulnerability to loss or theft of the token.
- Safety concerns if the IMD is inaccessible without the token.
- Constant reminder of the patient's health condition.

#### Communication Cloaker
In [6], a Communication Cloaker is proposed. This is an externally worn token (e.g., bracelet) that shares a secret key with the IMD. The cloaker periodically broadcasts beacons, and the IMD remains silent unless the cloaker is removed. This approach addresses the security/safety tension but shares the same drawbacks as token-based methods and is susceptible to jamming attacks.

#### Certificate-Based Approaches
Certificate-based approaches [9] configure the IMD with the public key of a trusted party. The reader contacts the trusted party to obtain a valid certificate, which is then used to establish a secure link.

**Drawbacks**:
- Requires internet access, which may not be available everywhere.
- Deployment of a global or nation-wide certification authority, which is costly.

#### User Alerts
This proposal [11] involves the IMD emitting an alert signal (sound, vibrations, etc.) during wireless communication. While simple, this method does not control access and has limitations in noisy environments, user reaction, and privacy.

#### Proximity-Based Access Control Approaches
- **Magnetic Switches**: Some schemes [21] use magnetic switches to enable wireless communication only when the IMD is activated by a magnetic field. This approach is insecure due to potential false activations by strong magnetic fields, such as those from headphones [7].
- **Secure Telemetric Link**: [1] proposes using a physical backdoor to verify proximity. The reader sends an activation message, and the IMD detects the reader's sensor to send an authentication key. This method is also vulnerable to high-gain antennas and eavesdropping.
- **Short-Range Communication Technologies**: Other schemes [15, 23] use technologies like IR, Bluetooth, and RFID to ensure proximity. However, these are vulnerable to range extension attacks using powerful transceivers and high-gain antennas.

#### Physiological Data-Based Approaches
Some researchers [28, 4] propose using physiological data (e.g., inter-pulse timing, heart beat frequency) to generate secret keys. However, the security of these schemes is hard to prove and can be compromised by remote measurements with sensitive probes.

### Our Proposed Solution
Our solution leverages ultrasonic distance-bounding to enforce access control with high accuracy. It is more secure than previous proximity-based approaches and considers side-channel attacks not previously addressed.

### Related Work
- **Distance-Bounding Protocols**: Initial work [2] and subsequent extensions [26, 25, 13, 20] have been developed. Ultrasonic communication for distance bounding was proposed in [24], and its application to key establishment and device pairing in [27].

### Conclusion
We propose a novel proximity-based access control scheme for IMDs using ultrasonic distance-bounding. Our approach ensures that only devices in close proximity can access the IMD's resources. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method through tests in an emulated patient environment, showing high accuracy in verifying proximity. Our protocol can be combined with existing countermeasures, including those against battery-draining Denial-of-Service attacks.
