Token-Based Approaches
With token-based approaches [22] the patient gets an access token
(e.g., USB stick, smart card) that is conﬁgured with a credential (of-
ten a secret key) that is shared with the IMD. When a doctor needs
to access a patient’s IMD, he gets the access token from the patient
and provides the credential to the reader. The IMD and the doctor’s
reader can then establish a secure link that is used to download data
or send programming commands. This approach is very practical,
however, it has several drawbacks: it does not protect against the
loss or theft of the token, it creates a safety problem since the IMD
is inaccessible if the user does not carry the token with him and it
serves as a reminder to the patient of his health state.
In [6], the authors propose a defensive technique called Commu-
nication Cloaker. A Cloaker is an externally worn token, for exam-
ple a bracelet, that shares a secret key with the IMD. The cloaker
broadcasts periodic beacons that are used by the IMD to detect its
presence. As long as the cloaker is detected, the IMD will stay mute
to any request coming from a reader. If a doctor needs to access the
IMD, the patient has to remove his cloaker to allow communica-
tion. This approach is interesting and provides an elegant solution
to the security/safety tension. However, it suffers from the same
drawbacks as the token-based approach described above. Further-
more, it is unclear how this solution copes with jamming attacks
that would prevent the cloaker from being heard by the IMD.
Certiﬁcate-Based Approaches
With certiﬁcate-based approaches [9] the IMD is conﬁgured with
the public key of a trusted party. When a reader wants to access
the IMD, it needs to contact the trusted party and get a valid certiﬁ-
cate (credential). This credential is then used to establish a secure
link between the IMD and the reader. This approach has several
drawbacks. First, it requires the reader to go online and contact
the trusted party. This is a very strong requirement since Inter-
net access might not be available everywhere (especially in case of
an accident on the road). Second, it requires the deployment of a
(global or at least nation-wide) certiﬁcation authority, which is a
costly solution.
User Alerts
In this proposal [11], the IMD emits an alert signal (sound, vibra-
tions, etc.), when it is engaging in wireless communication. This
proposal does not control access to the device, but rather alerts the
patient about an interaction. This solution might seem simple and
attractive but it does not work in noisy environments, it does not (in
itself) enable the user to react to the alert and creates new privacy
issues (by emitting a sound, the IMD is advertising its presence).
As we discussed, this solution can be naturally integrated with our
proposal since both proposals rely on the emission of sound and
thus require the same hardware.
Proximity Based Access Control Approaches
Some schemes (e.g., [21]) propose to disallow long distance wire-
less communication with the IMD until a proximity based proce-
dure has completed. For example, in most existing solutions, wire-
less communication won’t be possible unless the IMD is activated
by a magnetic switch. A magnetic ﬁeld is chosen as an input chan-
nel since the channel is quite simple, and standardized. Due to
the faster drop-off in ﬁeld strength of a magnet compared to radi-
ant energy the channel implies a certain degree of proximity. In
current generation devices, this approach is used, for example, to
disable deﬁbrillation shocks from the device while paramedics or
ER staff are diagnosing a patient’s EKG (which would be inter-
rupted by such a therapy), or to prevent shocks from a device that
has run amok. This solution is quite insecure, since the presence of
any strong magnetic ﬁeld will trigger the switch. Incidents were re-
ported where a magnetic ﬁeld from a patient’s headphones tripped
the read switch [7]). Since the activation of the read switch usu-
ally enables wireless communication, this means that someone with
headphones in their pocket might be vulnerable to attacks.
The secure telemetric link solution [1] proposes to use a physi-
cal backdoor to verify that the reader is close to the IMD. When the
reader wants to access the IMD, it sends an ”activation message”,
over the wireless channel to the IMD that activates the backdoor
circuitry. The reader then gets close to the IMD with, for example,
a near-ﬁeld magnetic sensor. If the IMD detects the reader’s sen-
sor, it sends the authentication key over the wireless link, using a
very low transmission power. The reader then gets the key and can
communicate with the IMD via the wireless link. If the IMD does
not detect the sensor within a given time frame, it deactivates the
backdoor. This solution has all the problems of the magnet-based
scheme described previously. In addition, it is not secure against
an attacker that uses special equipment (e.g., high-gain antennas)
to eavesdrop on the key.
Other schemes [15, 23] also use short-range communication tech-
nologies (such as IR, Bluetooth, RFID, etc.) to guarantee proxim-
ity. However, all approaches based on short-range communication
technologies are vulnerable to attacks since an attacker can eas-
ily increase the communication range using powerful and sensitive
transceivers and high-gain antennas. These schemes are therefore
not secure, since an attacker can eavesdrop and access IMDs from
far away. Essentially, with such approaches it is hard to say from
which distance access is no longer possible because it depends on
what kind of equipment the attacker uses.
Finally, some researchers propose to leverage secret keys be-
tween the IMD and the readers, using physiological data (such as
inter-pulse timing, heart beat frequency, etc.) [28, 4]. However, the
security of these schemes is hard to prove and sometimes dubious.
In fact, it has been shown that some of these data can be remotely
measured with sensitive probes [14]. Furthermore, it is unclear how
much entropy there is in the timing of heart beats and even whether
some of the secret cannot be retrieved from other channels.
417The solution proposed in our paper can enforce any access dis-
tance with a high degree of accuracy and is therefore inherently
more secure than previously described proximity-based approaches.
Distance-bounding
Independent of the IMD context, related work has been done in the
ﬁeld of location veriﬁcation based on radio and ultrasonic distance
bounding protocols. The ﬁrst distance-bounding protocol was de-
scribed in [2]. Other extensions and optimizations followed in [26,
25, 13, 20]. The use of distance bounding based on ultrasonic com-
munication channel was proposed in [24]. The application of dis-
tance bounding to key establishment device pairing was proposed
in [27].

Our proposal is similar to [27] in that it equally uses ultrasonic

distance bounding for proximity-based message authentication. How-
ever our proposal includes a number of design choices speciﬁc to
the IMD context and considers side-channel attacks that were, so
far, not considered in the design and implementation of distance-
bounding protocols.
7. CONCLUSION
In this work we proposed a novel proximity-based access con-
trol scheme for implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our scheme
is based on ultrasonic distance-bounding and enables an implanted
medical device to grant access to its resources only to those de-
vices that are in its close proximity. It is based on a new proximity-
based message authentication protocol based on ultrasonic distance
bounding that can authenticate arbitrary messages. We demon-
strated the feasibility of our approach through tests in an emulated
patient environment. We showed that, although implanted, IMDs
can successfully verify the proximity of other devices with a high
degree of accuracy. We show that our protocol can be seamlessly
combined with a number of existing IMD countermeasures includ-
ing those that prevent battery draining Denial-of-Service attacks.
Our proposal equally includes a number of design choices for dis-
tance bounding protocols that are speciﬁc to the IMD context and
considers side channel attacks that were not so far considered in the
design and implementation of distance bounding protocols.
