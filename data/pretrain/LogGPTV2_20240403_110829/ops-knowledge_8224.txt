User: I've installed Miniconda and have added the environment variable export PATH="/home/username/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" to my .bashrc and .bash_profile but still can't run any conda commands in my terminal.
Am I missing another step in my setup? I'm using zsh by the way.
Assistant: This worked for me on CentOS and miniconda3. Find out which shell you are using
echo $0
conda init bash (could be conda init zsh if you are using zsh, etc.) - this adds a path to ~/.bashrc
Reload command line
sourc ~/.bashrc OR . ~/.bashrc
