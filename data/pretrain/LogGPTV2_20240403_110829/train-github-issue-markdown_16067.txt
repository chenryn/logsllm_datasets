Sorry if this is a duplicate, but I didn't find anything...
Why does:  
`ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('right')` set`horizontalignment = 'left'` for the
tick labels?
    fig,ax=plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(np.arange(-10,10))
    ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('right')
I'm not clear on why the ticks should change their horizontal alignment based
on what side of the axis they are displayed on. I can _imagine_ a technical
difficulty in guessing how large the label is before it is drawn. Is this a
layout manager issue?
Most importantly for me, it makes colorbars look poor if they have negative
values, and require a manual twiddle to make look good.
