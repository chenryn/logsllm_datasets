1. **Task Progress Updates:**
   - The progress of two task attempts, `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` and `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0`, is being tracked.
   - The progress for `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` is reported as 0.37551183.
   - The progress for `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0` is reported as 0.38137424.

2. **Address Change Warnings:**
   - Multiple warnings are logged regarding detected address changes for the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` components.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000` or `msra-sa-41:8030`.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - There are repeated warnings indicating that the lease renewal for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` has failed. The failure duration increases from 84 to 87 seconds over the time period.
   - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly.

4. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs an attempt to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1 second between retries.
   - Errors are logged indicating that the connection to the Resource Manager (RM) has failed.

5. **Fatal Error:**
   - A fatal error occurs at 18:06:26, where the task `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0` exits due to a `NoRouteToHostException`.
   - The error message specifies a socket timeout exception, with the source being `MININT-FNANLI5/127.0.0.1` and the destination being `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - For more details, a reference to the Hadoop wiki is provided: [http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/NoRouteToHost](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/NoRouteToHost).

### Key Points
- **Task Progress:** Both tasks are making progress, but the progress values remain relatively static.
- **Network Issues:** There are recurring issues with address changes and lease renewals, which may indicate network instability.
- **RM Connection:** The system is unable to establish a stable connection to the Resource Manager, leading to errors.
- **Fatal Error:** A critical network issue results in a fatal error, causing one of the tasks to exit.

This summary provides a clear and structured overview of the log events, highlighting the main issues and their implications.
