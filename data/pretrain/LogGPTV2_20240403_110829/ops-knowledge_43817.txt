User: How to prevent DDoS (distributed denial of service attack)? Please provide relevant defense strategies and implementation methods.
Assistant: 1. Enhance network capabilities, such as increasing network bandwidth, upgrading network equipment, using CDN, etc., to improve network anti-attack defense capabilities; 2. Topology structure design adopts multi-architecture deployment, such as URL firewall, IDS and IP Spoofing protection, etc., to increase The depth of security; 3. Intrusion prevention technology installation firewall, VPN, traffic cleaning equipment, etc. are gradually applied to better reduce network threats and ensure dynamic network security; 4. Timely upgrade protection equipment Regularly upgrade protection software and hardware equipment, open necessary Log monitoring function. 5. Black and white list restrictions restrict access to the network, and restrict access to suspected attackers by using IP addresses, ports, etc. 6. Share attack traffic and allocate multiple IP addresses, and adopt back-to-source IP verification technology to achieve defense; 7. Cloud security can provide protection capabilities to multiple companies through reasonable use of cloud security solutions, reducing the need for upgrade costs, thereby improving Security; In short, preventing DDoS attacks requires a comprehensive defense strategy, and actively prevents possible attacks, maintains a flexible response method, and handles abnormal requests in a timely manner.
