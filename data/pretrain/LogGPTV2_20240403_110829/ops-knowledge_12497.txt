User: I'm looking for a Python IDE that can help me easily locate and manage and use the libraries on my system (Ubuntu).  Specifically Twisted.
Code completion is important including the symbols I import.
(I've so far had a look at PyDev as well as OpenKomodo, but while both offer code completion for default Python concepts, I wasn't able to get either to import Twisted into my project and was thus getting reference errors.)
Usual disclaimer: I don't like EMACS or vi, please, nothing regarding those.
Assistant: I've just downloaded the preview of netbeans and it seems to have done quite well so far.
It has detected inherited methods & properties.  I haven't had to add a single library reference in my project, so this seems to be the most fluid so far.
