## Checklist
  * I have included the output of `celery -A proj report` in the issue.  
(if you are not able to do this, then at least specify the Celery  
version affected).
  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
## Steps to reproduce
I have been using **celery==3.1.25** for scheduling my periodic tasks at
regular intervals. I am using the **redis==2.10.6** as our broker. The tasks
are getting scheduled using **apply_async** method and the time gets scheduled
using **eta or countdown**. My tasks are being duplicated at regular
intervals.  
I have also set the **timeout visibility** to be greater than my * _ETA_
