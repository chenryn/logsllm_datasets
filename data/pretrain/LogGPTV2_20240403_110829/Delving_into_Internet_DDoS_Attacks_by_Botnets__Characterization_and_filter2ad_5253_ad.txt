Similar to the analysis of the target geolocation change, we

the attack intervals between consecutive attacks towards the
same target. By doing that, we obtain a series of attack
intervals for each target; this information is also time-related
and might be utilized to characterize attack behaviors and
patterns. Figure 15 displays two examples of targets by the
family family Blackenergy.
In Figure 15, the x-axis represents the attack interval along
the time and the y-axis represents the interval value in seconds.
The ﬁgure shows some repeated patterns of peaks and dips of
their attack interval series. Besides the periodic pattern, they
also present stationary state concerning the mean value of the
attack interval values.
Prediction. This characterization alludes to the possibility of
predicting those series by modeling using an ARIMA model
to forecast the next attack interval value, thus the start time
of the next attack. To verify this possibility, we construct the
model as described earlier. Figure 16 and Figure 17 show
the prediction results. In both cases, we split the data into
two equal halves, one for the training pool and the other for
prediction and evaluation.
In both ﬁgures, the x-axis represents the time and the y-
axis represents the predicted values and ground truth values.
The ground truth values are marked by the dotted curves while
the predicted values are marked by the solid blue lines. From
those ﬁgures, it is clear that the predicted values match the
ground truth consistently.
We calculated various statistics for the ground truth and
predicted series for two instances as shown in Table VI. We
note that the model is capable of predicting the original series
with more than 90% accuracy, which conﬁrms our initial
conjecture, and highlights the potential of predicting attack
intervals accurately in many cases. In this case, accuracy is
denoted by cosine similarities between the prediction results
and the ground truth. By looking further into the nature of
the two instances of attacks captured by the series, we unveil
several interesting ﬁndings. Most importantly, both instances
are common and a recurring target for the families Blackenergy
and Dirtjumper. However, those patterns are not common
among or shared with other families, indicating that they are
sufﬁcient of identifying those families in particular as a result
of the prediction.
Insight into defenses: The country and organization level
target analyses provide insights for defenses. For example,
ﬁndings concerning the country-level characterization can set
some guidelines on country-level prioritization of disinfection
and botnet takedowns. Organization-level characterization and
ﬁndings associated with that can hint on the possible role
provisioning can play in maximizing protection capabilities.
Understanding the attack interval pattern guides preparation
for the attacks beforehand by allocating needed resources. This
guidance is even more educated when the evolution of attack
is predicted as shown in this section. Prediction with a high
accuracy facilities cost-effective provisioning of resources and

V. ANALYSIS OF COLLABORATIVE ATTACKS
So far, DDoS attacks were analyzed individually. Based on
the target analysis discussed earlier, we found that different
botnets (in the same family corresponding to different gener-
ations, or from different families) may collaborate to attack
the same target. They may launch attacks at the same time or
alternate their attacks in a way that indicates collaboration. In
the following, we elaborate on this collaboration.
Table VII shows the collaboration results using both intra-
family and cross-family collaborations. Basically, if different
botnets are targeting the same target, and their starting time
is simultaneous (or within a 60 second timeframe from each
other), and their duration difference is within half an hour,
then they are regarded as collaborations. As shown in this
table, 121 of the detected collaborations are between different
families. Among these collaborations, we observe that two
families, namely Dirtjumper and Darkshell, have the most
intra-family collaborations. Next, we look into these intra-
family collaborations (between different botnet IDs of the same
family) and inter-family collaborations in details.
Looking into Figure 18 , we also ﬁnd that for most bars
along the same timestamp, they have the same height. Such
an observation reduces the likelihood of involvement of the
previously mentioned entities in these collaborations. That
is, for all the botnets involved in the collaboration, detailed
instructions were perhaps given for the attack magnitude.
While that being a random coincidence is possible, it is not
plausible, and that further highlights the potential of close
collaborations between different botnets.
In addition to the collaborative attacks launched by botnets
from the same family, we found that there are attacks launched
by botnets from different botnet families. From Table VII, we
can see that all families involved in inter-family collaborations
had collaborated with Dirtjumper. Among these collaborations,
Dirtjumper and Pandora collaborated with each other the most.
Our next analysis will focus on those two families.
The collaborations between Dirtjumer and Pandora in-
volved 96 unique targets, which were located in 16 countries,
58 organizations and 61 ASes. Among the 16 countries,
the most popular three countries were Russia, the USA and
Germany; with 31, 26 and 14 attacks per country, respectively.
On the other hand, for Pandora, the average duration of an
attack was 6, 420 seconds (107 minutes), while the duration
was 5, 083 seconds (87.7 minutes) per attack for Dirtjumper.

A. Concurrent Attacks
Figure 18 shows the collaboration attack magnitude by
the family Dirtjumper. For clarity with respect to the multiple
variables, we plot a three dimensional (3D) ﬁgure characteriz-
ing Dirtjumper: the x-axis represents each unique botnet ID,
the y-axis represents the date of collaboration, and the z-axis
represents the attack volume. From this ﬁgure, we can see that
for most collaborations, there are two botnets involved, where
the average number of botnets involved in the collaboration
is 2.19. Such collaborations may be due to a guided action
by botmasters, or as instrumented by bots themselves (e.g.,
multiple entities behind various attacks coincided to utilize
the same resources to attack the same target at random).

Inter-family collaborations between Dirtjumper and Pandora
Figure 19 shows the duration and attack magnitude of
collaborations between Dirtjumper and Pandora as they change
over time. Note that
the left y-axis represents the attack
duration while the right y-axis represents the attack magnitude.
Both of the y-axes are in log scale. The histogram shows the
attack magnitude and the curve shows the attack durations.
From this ﬁgure, we observe that the attack magnitude for
these two families are almost equal for most of the attacks,
and the duration of these two families are almost identical.
Another observation we make is that the attack magnitudes are
not very high for both families except for an outlier. Finally,
we observe that the time span of collaboration lasted from
October 2012 until January 2013, covering nearly 16 weeks.

This long-term collaboration between Dirtjumper and Pandora
highlights a close tie between the two families.
B. Multistage Attacks
Thus far, we consider the collaboration as multiple indi-
vidual DDoS attacks are launched at the same time. Besides
this kind of collaboration, another form of collaboration could
be multiple DDoS attacks happening continuously one after
another. Next, we investigated this type of collaboration among
botnets. For this purpose, we extract the DDoS attacks on a
given target that happen consecutively (i.e., the second attack
happens at the end of the ﬁrst attack, or within 60 second mar-
gin over overlap). For this type of attack, the results show that
only intra-family collaborations were involved. Furthermore,
we found that four families had this type of collaboration;
Darkshell, Ddoser, Dirtjumper and Nitol.
Among all the families and collaborations, Ddoser has
the longest consecutive DDoS attack involving 22 continuous
attacks that lasted for more than 18 minutes on August 30,
2012. On average, the mean interval between two consecutive
attacks was 0.11 seconds (a median of three seconds) with a
standard deviation of 23 seconds (bursty period)
