Assistant: This log chunk shows that the CBS software component is having difficulty processing an attribute. Three sessions were initialized by the WindowsUpdateAgent, but the package was unable to be opened internally. The log also shows that the CBS software component is expecting an attribute name, but is unable to get the next element, resulting in a warning about an unrecognized packageExtended attribute.
