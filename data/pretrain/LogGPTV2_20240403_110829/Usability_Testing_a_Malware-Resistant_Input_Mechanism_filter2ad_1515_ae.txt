greatly (maxImprove a
AW(u) ∈ [.75, 1.0], corresponding to
the rightmost, white bars in the histograms) or very little
(maxImprove a
AW(u) ∈ [0, .25), corresponding to the dark
gray bars one bar-width from the y-axis). Unfortunately it
appears that the latter was more common, but in some sense
this is unsurprising: even a single login instance in which
the user u mistakenly leaked her password results in a value
of maxLeaked a
AW(u) that cannot be offset with numerous
mistake-free logins. In this respect, we are encouraged by
the users with large values for maxImprove a
AW(u).
Reﬂecting on our results, a lesson is that training in a
real deployment should perhaps require users to repeat lo-
gins that would have leaked password characters to malware
had it been present. Instead, in Attack-and-Warn, we sim-
ply warned users but allowed them to proceed to the course
web page if they entered the correct password. We con-
sidered forcing users to repeat logins in which they leaked
characters but feared that such heavy-handed training would

to withdraw or the course instructor to protest.
In a real
deployment in a security-conscious organization, however,
such an approach might be warranted.
To further measure the training effect of the warning
messages, we looked to the exit questionnaire. There was
a question corresponding to each individual type of attack
(varying by design) which asked if the warning message
helped them to avoid falling for the same attack in the
future. A screenshot of the warning message was pre-
sented along with a ﬁve-level Likert scale ranging from
1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) and an addi-
tional sixth choice for users who reported not reading the
warning message. In order to test the null hypothesis that
the user responses and true performance are not correlated,
we compared the responses with actual behavior by look-
ing at the number of times the user saw the warning mes-
sage in question. First we removed all users who never
saw the warning message, and then we removed users who
did not read the warning message. On the remaining data,
