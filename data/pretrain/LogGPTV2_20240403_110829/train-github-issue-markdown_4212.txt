I discovered that the following does not work:
    julia> muladd!(_, ::Nothing, _; kwargs...) = nothing
    ERROR: syntax: all-underscore identifier used as rvalue around REPL[2]:1
    Stacktrace:
     [1] top-level scope at REPL[2]:1
whereas without kwargs, it's fine:
    julia> muladd!(_, ::Nothing, _) = nothing
    muladd! (generic function with 1 method)
