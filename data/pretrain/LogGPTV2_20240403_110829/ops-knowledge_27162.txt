User: I have a somewhat unique request. What I am looking to do is listen on a specific port for all traffic coming through via IRC protocol. I then want to log all of those messages/commands/ect. I do not, however, want to join the channel. I just want to listen and log. Is there an easy built in way to do this? I have been looking at the irc.IRC and irc.IRCClient classes in twisted but they both seem too high level to do this. Is the only way to do this to simply descend to the base Server class, or can I still leverage some of the higher level functionality of twisted?
Assistant: We addressed this issue in a somewhat round about way. We worked off a generic hexdumping proxy server constructed in twisted and then created finer detail parsing algorithms off of that.
