I have a somewhat unique request. I am looking to monitor a specific port for all traffic that comes through using the IRC protocol. My goal is to log all messages, commands, and other data without actually joining any channels. I simply want to listen and log the traffic.

Is there an easy, built-in way to achieve this in Twisted? I have been examining the `irc.IRC` and `irc.IRCClient` classes in Twisted, but they seem too high-level for my needs. Is the only solution to use the base `Server` class, or can I still leverage some of the higher-level functionalities provided by Twisted?

Regarding your question, we addressed this issue in a somewhat indirect manner. We started with a generic hexdumping proxy server built using Twisted. From there, we developed more detailed parsing algorithms to handle the specific requirements. This approach allowed us to capture and log the IRC traffic effectively.

This version is more structured and clearly conveys your request and the solution you found.
