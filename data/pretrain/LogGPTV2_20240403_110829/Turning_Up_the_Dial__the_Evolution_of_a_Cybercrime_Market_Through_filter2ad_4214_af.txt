### Gaining Reputation
Second, the proportion of private contracts in our dataset is considerable (approximately 88%), which means that some details are not fully accessible to us. Our dataset is made available for academic research through a data sharing agreement. We hope that the analyses presented in this paper, along with the provided dataset, will facilitate further studies to better understand how underground economies have been established, operated, and evolved.

### Appendix
#### Contract Process in Detail
Figure 14 shows the contract-making process in detail, with nine transaction statuses denoted by dashed lines. For the analyses in this paper, we simplify both 'Complete' and 'Completed' as 'Complete'.

#### Ethical Considerations
This dataset is collected from a publicly available online forum, and our scraping method does not violate any of the forum's regulations at the time the data was collected. It would be nearly impossible to gain consent from all forum members, as it would be regarded as spamming. However, since our work only studies collective behaviors rather than individual ones, and the data are publicly available, it is justified in accordance with the British Society of Criminology’s Statement on Ethics [4]. Additionally, in our paper, the identity of all contracts, posts, threads, and users involved are entirely hidden to ensure that no private sensitive information is revealed. We strictly follow our institution’s ethical review procedure and carefully design our experiments to operate ethically and collectively without aiming to identify individuals. Subject to a strict legal framework, the dataset is provided for academic researchers by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre, so that other researchers can fully reproduce our experiments or conduct further analyses based on our results. In contrast to much previous research on underground cybercrime forums, in this paper, we name the site we investigated as the 'Hack Forums' forum. This is due to the particular characteristics of this forum, which make effective obfuscation impossible: its size (the largest underground forum by some measure) and the operation of its contracts.

#### Table 8: Top 3 Transaction Flows Within Each Product Category Over Three Eras as Percentage of All Transactions of That Kind
For example, 7% of Exchange transactions during the Set-up era were made by class F users and accepted by class E users, with an average of 58.8 Exchange transactions between users in these classes per month.
