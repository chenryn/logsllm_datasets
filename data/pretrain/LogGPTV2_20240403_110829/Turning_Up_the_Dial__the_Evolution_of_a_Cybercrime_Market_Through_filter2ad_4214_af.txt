gain reputation. Second, the proportion of private contracts in our
dataset is considerable (around 88%), which means some details
are hidden from us. Our dataset is made available for academic
research through a data sharing agreement. We hope our analyses
presented in this paper, as well as the dataset we provide, enable
further studies into better understandings of how underground
economies have been established, operated, and evolved.

Contract Process in Detail
Figure 14 shows the contract making process in detail, with 9 trans-
action statuses denoted by dashed lines. Note for the analyses in this
paper, we simplify both ‘Complete’ and ‘Completed’ as ‘Complete’.

Ethical Considerations
This dataset is collected on a publicly available online forum, in
which our scraping method does not violate any of the forum’s
regulations at that time the data was collected. It would be nearly
impossible to gain consent from all forum’s members as it would
be regarded as spamming, however, since our work only studies
the collective behaviours instead of individual, and the data are
publicly available, it is justified in accordance with the British So-
ciety of Criminology’s Statement on Ethics [4]. Additionally, in
our paper, the identity of all contracts, posts, threads, and users
involved are entirely hidden to ensure that no private sensitive
information could be revealed. We strictly follow our institution’s
ethical review procedure and carefully designed our experiments to
operate ethically and collectively without aiming to identify indi-
viduals. Subject to a strict legal framework, the dataset is provided
for academic researchers by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre
so that other researchers can fully reproduce our experiments or
conduct further analyses upon our results. In contrast to much pre-
vious research on underground cybercrime forums, in this paper we
name the site which we investigated as the ‘Hack Forums’ forum.
This is due to the particular characteristics of this forum, which
make effective obfuscation impossible: its size (the largest under-
ground forum by some measure) and the operation of its contracts
