## 🐛 Bug
The MSELoss criteria has a strange behavior when used with two tensors of
different sizes -- I would expect this to throw an error. Instead it does...
something else.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Install stable, non-CUDA torch, i.e.:
https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.0.0-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
    >>> import torch
    >>> import torch.nn as nn
    >>> a = torch.Tensor([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = torch.Tensor([[1],[2],[3]])
    >>> nn.MSELoss()(a, b)
    tensor(1.3333)
## Expected behavior
I would've appreciated an error in this case. Perhaps there is some reason why
someone might wish to call MSELoss with different sized arrays... but I think
if the _number of dimensions_ between the two vectors differs, it's likely the
user's mistake.
I realize this is a "rookie mistake," but I promise it was _not_ a fun way to
spend 2 hours. Perhaps a friendly warning message could save someone the
headache in the future?
