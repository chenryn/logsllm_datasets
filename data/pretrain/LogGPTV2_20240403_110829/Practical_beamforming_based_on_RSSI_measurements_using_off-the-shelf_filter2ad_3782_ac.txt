Figure 4: Transport layer performance
the beamforming algorithm at the Tx. We observe that while the
client cannot associate when using a single antenna element, the
use of beamforming improves the signal strength and consequently
the connectivity. We send a sequence of ICMP PING packets from
the AP to the client, to determine the connectivity. We show the
latency of successful ping responses and loss rate in Table 1. As
can be observed, for several runs spaced apart by 10 minutes, both
the average loss rate and latency of the ping response are very high
when using Omni. We tabulate the delay for those packets that are
successful. In some runs (Run 1, 2), the delays are very high and
sporadic, because there is no connectivity at those locations. How-
ever, using the beamforming solution causes successful responses
with an average latency of 1.67ms and zero loss.
3.4 Transport layer performance
In this part, we are interested in evaluating how the beneﬁts of
beamforming translate to application layer performance. We con-
sider the following two dimensions: Uplink vs. downlink and TCP
vs. UDP, which are the representative transport characteristics for
several wireless LAN applications. For this experiment, we use a
ﬁxed location (location 2) and plot the throughput obtained. For
the downlink case, we execute a 30-second run using Iperf from
the AP to the client for the Omni and beamforming cases. The
resulting throughput is plotted in Figure 3.1.
Downlink: From the ﬁgure, we observe that the downlink UDP
throughput increases from an average of 0.9 Mbps to 22.1 Mbps,
whereas the TCP throughput increases from 1.06 Mbps to 14.2
Mbps when beamforming is applied. Thus there is signiﬁcant im-
provement for both transport protocols, but the gain is higher with
UDP, due to the adverse reaction of TCP to even minimal losses.
Uplink: On the other hand, the beneﬁts are much smaller for the
Uplink case as reported in Figure 3.1. We recall that the dominant
factor as far as the throughput is concerned is the rate at which the
MAC layer DATA packet is sent, since the ACK packet is always
sent at the basic rate of the 802.11 standard (1 Mbps for 802.11b
and 6 Mbps for 802.11g). While the downlink can directly improve
the data rate of the 802.11 DATA transmissions, the beamforming
gains for the uplink case can only reduce the error in the packet re-
ception but cannot adjust the datarate (as the client uses a single el-
ement). Since the MAC layer ACK is always sent at the base rate of
6Mbps it cannot be used to improve the datarate of the ACK trans-
missions, thereby leaving the beamforming gains unused. Thus, it
is clear that the magnitude of the beamforming beneﬁts depends on
the trafﬁc characteristics.
Delay: In addition, we also study how the link delay changes
with beamforming. We plot the packet round trip delay in Figure
3.1 for location 2, when Omni and beamforming are used. It is clear
that even for locations which have connectivity, the average delay
is reduced from 6.5ms to 1.3ms when beamforming is employed.
In addition, the standard deviation in delay (which is important to
video applications) is reduced from 2.49 to 0.28 ms.

MIMO Clients: In this work we have considered clients with
omni-directional antennas since the majority of current deployed
clients have a single (omni-directional) antenna. However, recently
multiple antennas at the clients(e.g. the IEEE 802.11n standard) are
also becoming popular. With such clients, adaptive beamforming
can be used along with other approaches such as Spatial Multiplex-
ing when the latter approaches suffer in performance. More impor-
tantly, when performing multi-link MIMO, the channels between
each transmit antenna and each receive antenna must be measured
in order to perform interference suppression.Thus, even with other
strategies that are possible with MIMO, channel estimation devel-
oped in this work is important. A simple extension of the current
procedure to such cases would involve performing this procedure
for each receive antenna, one at a time. Exploring more optimized
variants of the current procedure is an interesting direction for fu-
ture work.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we develop a new beamforming algorithm that ap-
proximates the channel estimation procedure by using power mea-
surements.
It is shown that RSSI can be used as an approxima-
tion for the received power and used to compute the channel co-
efﬁcients, provided that an intelligent estimation technique is used
at the Tx. Using an experimental deployment, beamforming us-
ing such channel estimation is shown to achieve signiﬁcant bene-
ﬁts without incurring excessive complexity; thus it becomes prac-
tical to implement and achieve beamforming gains using off-the-
shelf wireless clients.The ability to exploit the multipath channel
through beamforming with simple RSSI measurements at the client
has opened up several interesting directions for exploration, such
as: a) investigating if the beamforming solution can be extended
for simultaneously serving multiple users from a single AP, and b)
exploring if such a beamforming solution can be used for improved
spatial reuse and better interference management across multiple
APs.
