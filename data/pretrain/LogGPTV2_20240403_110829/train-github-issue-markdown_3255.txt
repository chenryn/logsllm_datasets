### Problem Description
The `plotWindow` application supports the creation of multiple tabs, each of which can contain several subplots. However, there is an issue with displaying a vertical cursor across multiple tabs using the `MultiCursor` feature in Matplotlib.

### Proposed Solution
One potential solution is to natively integrate tab support within Matplotlib. This would ensure that the `MultiCursor` feature works correctly for all subplots across all tabs.

Alternatively, if implementing native tab support in Matplotlib is too complex, any suggestions on how to resolve the integration issue between `plotWindow` and Matplotlib—specifically, how to use a vertical cursor across subplots in all tabs—would be greatly appreciated.
