### Problem
The program plotWindow allows several tabs to be created, and subplots within
each tab.
The problem is that plotWindow seems unable to display a vertical cursor in
several tabs, using MultiCursor.
### Proposed solution
One solution could be to enable support for tabs natively within MatPlotLib.
This would make it possible to use MultiCursor correctly for all subplots, and
with all tabs.
Otherwise, if anyone has ideas about how to solve the problem of plotWindow
integration with MatPlotLib (specifically, how to use a vertical cursor across
subplots, and to allow this for all tabs), that would be fine if native tabs
support is too hard.
