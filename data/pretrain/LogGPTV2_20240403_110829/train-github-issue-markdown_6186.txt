### Issue Description:

When attempting to perform bitwise shift operations on a `np.uint64` value, the following errors occur:

```python
>>> np.uint64(5) << 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: ufunc 'left_shift' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule 'safe'

>>> np.uint64(5) >> 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: ufunc 'right_shift' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule 'safe'
```

### Summary:
Bitwise left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operations are not supported for `np.uint64` values, resulting in a `TypeError` indicating that the ufuncs `left_shift` and `right_shift` are not supported for the given input types. The error message also indicates that the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule 'safe'.
