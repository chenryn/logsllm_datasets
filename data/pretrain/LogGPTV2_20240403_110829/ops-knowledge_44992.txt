To effectively implement CIS Control 10.2, "Configure Automatic Anti-Malware Signature Updates," an organization should follow these main procedures:

1. **Policy and Procedure Development:**
   - Develop and document a clear policy that mandates the automatic updating of anti-malware signature files on all enterprise assets.
   - Ensure the policy specifies the frequency and timing of updates to minimize disruption to business operations.

2. **Asset Inventory:**
   - Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all devices and systems within the organization that require anti-malware protection.
   - Categorize these assets to ensure that each type of device (e.g., servers, workstations, mobile devices) is appropriately configured for automatic updates.

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - Configure the anti-malware software on all devices to automatically download and install the latest signature updates.
   - Use centralized management tools to monitor and enforce the update process across the network.

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Regularly test the update process to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that all devices are receiving the latest signatures.
   - Validate that the updates do not cause any compatibility issues or performance degradation.

5. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Implement monitoring mechanisms to track the status of anti-malware signature updates across all devices.
   - Generate regular reports to provide visibility into the update status and any issues that may arise.

6. **Incident Response:**
   - Establish an incident response plan to address any failures in the automatic update process, including manual intervention if necessary.
   - Document and review any incidents to improve the update process and prevent future occurrences.

CIS Control 10.2 is categorized under the asset type "Devices" and serves the security function of "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can ensure that their anti-malware defenses remain up-to-date and effective against the latest threats.
