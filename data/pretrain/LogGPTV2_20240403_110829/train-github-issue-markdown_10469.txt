### Version
2.6.4
### Reproduction link
https://gist.github.com/DominusVilicus/f825d90575fccd6d437b02061c725a91 (code-
sandbox doesn't allow `import()`)
### Steps to reproduce
    export default {
      render(h){
        return h(import('./comp'))
      }
    }
Results in an infinite loop that **stops the browser tab from working**
(chrome). Just need to do `vue create app`, and create two components, and
then use them in the `App.vue`
    export default {
      computed:{
        component(){
          return () => import('./comp')
        }
      },
      render(h){
        return h(this.component)
      }
    }
works fine however
**comp.vue**
        Hello World
### What is expected?
Returning the `import`ed component in `h(import('./comp'))` should render the
async component
### What is actually happening?
It's going in an infinite loop (try put `console.log('test')` in `render()`
