Abstract. In the Internet, Autonomous Systems continuously exchange
routing information via the BGP protocol: the large number of networks
involved and the verbosity of BGP result in a huge stream of updates.
Making sense of all those messages remains a challenge today. In this
paper, we leverage the notion of “primary path” (i.e., the most used
inter-domain path of a BGP router toward a destination preﬁx for a
given time period), reinterpreting updates by grouping them in terms of
primary paths unavailability periods, and illustrate how BGP dynamics
analysis would beneﬁt from working with primary paths.
Our contributions are as follows. First, through measurements, we
validate the existence of primary paths: by analyzing BGP updates
announced at the LINX RIS route collector spanning a three months
period, we show that primary paths are consistently in use during the
observation period. Second, we quantify the beneﬁts of primary paths
for BGP dynamics analysis on two use cases: Internet tomography and
anomaly detection. For the latter, using three months of anomalous BGP
events documented by BGPmon as reference, we show that primary paths
could be used for detecting such events (hijacks and outages), testifying
of the increased semantic they provide.
1 Introduction
The Internet, from an inter-domain perspective, is a collection of routers scat-
tered in about 60,000 Autonomous Systems (ASes) [3]. To ensure the full connec-
tivity over the Internet, routers use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [29] to
announce reachability information concerning IP preﬁxes. More precisely, upon
reception of routing updates from a neighbor, a BGP router ﬁrst applies import
policies, which might ﬁlter or modify the route. In case this information trig-
gers some change of its routing table, the router may announce an update to
its neighbors. Thus, each router announces at most one best path (except with
BGP multi-path extension [35]) for each destination to its neighbors and sends an

update whenever this best path changes. Best path selection is non-trivial due to
complex and opaque BGP policies on the one hand, and to the fact that updates
propagate hop-by-hop across the network on the other hand: particularly, this
results in a limited visibility of the whole topology for any router, and can also
lead to slow convergence because of the path exploration phenomenon [23].
Path exploration can happen whenever a BGP router has several neighbors
announcing a path to a given preﬁx. Depending on the arrival order of announce-
ments, a router might explore transient paths before converging to its best path.
Note that path exploration may cascade: a router exploring paths may trigger
the exploration of paths by its neighbors. In short, while BGP routers seek best
paths, opacity and verbosity of BGP along with limited visibility make it hard
to analyze BGP dynamics. It is still challenging to determine the causes of BGP
updates [6,14,16,17] – which is crucial to detect and mitigate preﬁx hijacking, as
well as for detecting misconﬁgurations and leakages, or troubleshooting network
operations.
The new proposal of this paper is to systematically leverage inter-domain sta-
bility to preprocess BGP updates, with the goal of augmenting the data source
(Sect. 2). More precisely, we ﬁrst discuss and validate the notion of primary path,
i.e., the most used inter-domain path for a router to a preﬁx in a given time
period. Using primary paths as reference, updates can therefore be interpreted
in terms of deviations from a nominal behavior, and grouped accordingly for fur-
ther analysis (Sect. 3). By leveraging three months worth of BGP updates and
publicly available data from a well-known alert service, we demonstrate inter-
est of primary paths on two use cases: inter-domain tomography and anomaly
detection (Sect. 4).
2 Related Work
BGP dynamics has been widely studied in the past, both for tomography and
anomaly detection purposes. A thorough overview is out of the scope of this
paper, but we brieﬂy contextualize where our contributions take place.
Past works on tomography have mainly leveraged temporal and topologi-
cal properties of updates to characterize BGP dynamics. Labovitz et al. [10,19]
analyzed various temporal properties of updates from inter-arrival time to con-
vergence time. Li et al. [20] extended these works and analyzed the evolution
of these properties over a decade. Elmokashﬁ et al. [13] studied updates churn,
pointing out recurrent events on BGP dynamics. Instead, in this article we pro-
pose to leverage inter-domain stability to characterize BGP dynamics.
Past signiﬁcant works on anomaly detection have been broadly reviewed in
[2]. Techniques used to analyze updates include time series analysis [22,27], sta-
tistical pattern recognition [12,32], machine learning [1,33], and historical data
[15,18]. Other techniques exist, such as visualization approaches [8,9,21,25]. His-
torical data techniques consist in keeping track of all previously used paths to
analyze new announcements. Instead, our proposal is to identify and only use
stable paths to interpret updates.

It must also be noted that path stability in the Internet has already been
pointed out. In 1996, Paxson [26] sampled routes in use between 37 hosts through
periodic traceroutes and showed that they were mostly stable. Moreover, by
analyzing their prevalence (probability to observe a particular route) and per-
sistence (probability for a route to be used for a long period of time), they
exhibited the existence of dominant routes. Rexford et al. [30] deﬁned events
as group of updates arriving close in time and pointed out that inter-domain
paths related to popular destinations were undergoing few events. Chang et al.
[7] grouped updates into bursts based on temporal thresholds and showed that
many path advertisements were resulting from transient path changes. Some
works also leveraged the notion of path stability for speciﬁc purposes. Butler
et al. [5] showed that ASes have few distinct paths for a preﬁx over time and
proposed to use this observation to reduce the cost of cryptographic BGP path
authentication. Qiu et al. [28], assuming inter-domain stability, proposed to lever-
age it through machine learning to detect bogus routes. In this paper, we extend
these works by showing that stability holds across the whole inter-domain and
that it can be systematically leveraged for diﬀerent use cases of BGP dynamics
analysis.
3 Inter-domain Stability
3.1 Primary Paths
Our approach builds on the assumption that the BGP inter-domain structure is
highly stable over relatively long periods of time [5,26,30]. We show that this is a
reasonable assumption in Sect. 4.1. Intuitively, we expect this stability to follow
from the timescale of changes among AS agreements that are negotiated few
times a year. Consider indeed that BGP best path selection starts by assessing
the local preference attribute, which encodes business agreements between ASes:
it follows that every router r should have a set of preferred paths (with the same
highest local preference) toward any preﬁx p over relatively long periods of time,
and deviate from those only during relatively short transient periods (e.g., due
to path exploration).
In this article, we additionally argue that, among those preferred paths, there
is one dominant path that is consistently chosen as best path during an obser-
vation window W : we refer to this path as the primary path of r to p. In a
more formal way, considering for the time being an oﬄine case for the sake of
simplicity, let us deﬁne as Tx(r, p) the sum of the cumulative time during W
that router r uses path x to reach preﬁx p. Then the primary path is selected
as the one satisfying argmaxxTx(r, p).
Following from the given deﬁnition above, we compute primary paths in an
oﬄine fashion from updates collected at the LINX RIPE RIS route collector
[31] on a three month time window (from January 1st to March 31st 2017).
The dataset consists of 487, 104, 558 IPv4 updates (157, 249, 182 IPv6 updates)
and 5, 482, 564 IPv4  pairs (412, 350 IPv6 pairs). It includes 38
IPv4 vantage points (14 IPv6 vantage points) among which 7 announce a “full”

routing table in IPv4 (10 for IPv6). To bootstrap the primary path repository,
we use the last routing table dump (bview.20161231.2359) before the beginning
of our observation window. We use BGPstream [24] to decode MRT ﬁles. Results
are shown in Fig. 1. We start by conﬁrming that in most cases primary paths
dominate other paths over relatively long periods of time. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁgure
shows the percentage of time that the primary path was used during the obser-
vation period W = 3 months for all  pairs. Formally, denoting
as before with x1 the primary path and with Tx1(r, p) the sum of the cumulative
time during W where router r uses path x1 to reach preﬁx p, the ﬁgure shows the
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the primary path
usage during the whole observation period, i.e., Tx1(r, p)/W . The data shows
that about 85% of the primary paths in IPv4 (90% for IPv6) are in use at least
about half of the observation period W , and even more interesting, about 35%
IPv4 (42% IPv6) primary paths are in use for over 99.9% of W .
3.2 Pseudo-events
Under the assumption of primary paths stability over long timescales, we argue
that BGP dynamics can be described in terms of:
– Transient events, where some routers explore paths before reconverging to
their primary paths (e.g., possibly due to failure, misconﬁguration, attack,
etc.).
– Structural events, where some routers explore paths before switching con-
sistently to a new primary path (e.g., as a result of routing policy or agreement
changes).
A given event can impact many primary paths from many routers to many
preﬁxes. Therefore, to keep working at the  pair granularity
we deﬁne the notion of pseudo-event as the impact of an event for a given
primary path x1 used by a router r to a preﬁx p. Thus it is possible to further
distinguish between:

– Transient pseudo-events, making r explore path(s) to p and reconverge to
– Structural pseudo-events, making r explore path(s) to p and converge to
x1.

Moreover, pseudo-events can be characterized by:
– a duration: period of time where the primary path x1 from r to p is not
– a path exploration sequence: sequence of N − 1 transient paths x =

Figure 2a and b portray the above cases. Therefore, pseudo-events enable to
group updates following a primary path unavailability, instead of relying on some
temporal threshold [7,23,30] (which result in grouping updates into bursts). An
interesting follow-up characteristic from this paradigm is that pseudo-events are
resilient to long-lasting events. Indeed, the longer an event lasts (a failure for
