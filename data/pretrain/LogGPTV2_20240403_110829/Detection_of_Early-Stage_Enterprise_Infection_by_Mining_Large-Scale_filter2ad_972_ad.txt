### Evaluation on Enterprise Data

We implemented a fully operational system that has been running in production since January 1, 2014, to process web proxy logs from the AC dataset. The data collected in January was used to train various components of the system (e.g., the C&C detector, the domain scoring module, etc.) and to profile external destinations and user-agent strings used by enterprise hosts in HTTP communication. Starting from February 1, the system entered daily operation mode, where it processes new web proxy logs, applies normalization and reduction techniques, compares the data with the profiles (which are also updated), and applies our detection techniques.

The algorithm operates in several stages:
1. **SOC Hints Mode**: We use malicious domains from the IOC list provided by the SOC as seeds.
2. **C&C Detector**: We run our C&C detector to identify suspicious domains with automated activities.
3. **Belief Propagation (No-Hint Mode)**: These domains are then used as seeds for belief propagation in the no-hint mode.

The detection results are thoroughly validated using a combination of tools and manual analysis. The system is configurable with different parameters (e.g., scoring thresholds, number of iterations in belief propagation, etc.), according to the SOC's processing capacity. We present our validation methodology and the results in different modes of operation.

#### A. Validation Methodology

The domains output by our detector in both modes were validated as follows:
1. **Initial Verification**: We query VirusTotal and the IOC domain list to verify their status (three months after they were detected, to allow anti-virus and blacklists to catch up). If the domain is flagged by at least one scanner used by VirusTotal or is an IOC, we consider it known malicious.
2. **Manual Investigation**: For other domains, we collect additional information and hand them over to a security analyst for manual investigation. Specifically, the analyst retrieves the associated URLs from the log data, crawls them to examine the responses, and manually submits the URLs to McAfee SiteAdvisor.
3. **Classification**: Based on the URLs, the response to our crawler, and the result from SiteAdvisor, the analyst classifies the remaining domains into four categories:
   - **New Malicious**: Domains with URL patterns similar to known malicious domains, returning malicious content, or flagged by SiteAdvisor.
   - **Suspicious**: Domains that are not resolvable when crawled, parked, or having some questionable activities.
   - **Legitimate**: Domains with no suspicious behavior or code observed.
   - **Unknown**: Domains with a 504 HTTP response code, indicating a server error.

Since there were only a few unknowns (6 in total), they were removed from the final results. When reporting our results, we use the same precision and FPR metrics from Section V-C, and a new-discovery rate (NDR) defined as the percentage of new malicious and suspicious domains detected by our approach (and not yet identified by VirusTotal and SOC). We present graphs in Figure 7 and statistics of our findings in Table III.

#### B. Results for the SOC Hints Mode

Figure 7(a) shows the results for the belief propagation algorithm in the SOC hints mode, seeded with 28 IOC domains. The graph displays the total number of detected domains and their categories for different domain similarity score thresholds. The seed domains are not included in the final results. When computing domain registration features, we could not parse WHOIS information for 27% of the domains. For these domains, we set default values for the DomAge and DomValidity features at average values across all other domains.

As the domain similarity score threshold varies between 0.33 and 0.45, the number of detected domains ranges from 137 to 73, with precision ranging from 78.8% to 94.6%. Among the 137 detected domains, 108 turn out to be malicious (either known or new) and suspicious, which is about four times larger than the malicious set of domains used for seeding. The FPR is low at 3.97 · 10−4% over 7.3M domains.

Among the 108 malicious and suspicious domains, 79 are confirmed by SOC or VirusTotal, leaving 29 domains as our new findings. We inspected the new findings and identified an interesting group of domains generated through Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). Hosts infected with DGA malware generate a large number of domains (using a predefined algorithm) to hide the actual rendezvous points with the C&C center, which is only a handful of the contacted domains. The attacker knows the DGA algorithm used by the bots and registers domains to communicate with the bots at specific times.

This group consists of 10 domains under the top-level domain (TLD) .info, with each domain name having 20 characters (e.g., f0371288e0a20a541328.info). Surprisingly, the registration dates for most of the domains are later than the detection time, demonstrating that our techniques have an advantage against attackers by inferring the next rendezvous point and taking preventive measures early.

#### C. Results for C&C Detector

To evaluate the C&C detector, we computed scores for all automated domains visited daily. We varied the domain score threshold for labeling automated connections from 0.4 to 0.48 and presented the results for domains detected as C&C domains (with scores above the threshold) in Figure 7(b). As we increase the threshold on automated domain scores from 0.4 to 0.48, the number of domains labeled as C&C drops from 114 to 19, while precision increases from 85.1% to 94.7%. Although the FPR is higher for the threshold 0.4 (at 2.33 · 10−4%), more malicious domains (including 23 new ones not known to VirusTotal or SOC) are detected.

#### D. Results for the No-Hint Case

We fixed the automated domain score threshold at 0.4 to evaluate belief propagation in the no-hint mode. We varied the domain similarity score threshold from 0.33 to 0.85, and the results (Figure 7(c)) show that the number of all detected domains varies from 265 to 114, with precision ranging from 76.2% to 85.1%. In the most challenging case (when no hint is available), we detected 202 malicious and suspicious domains in February, associated with 945 hosts.

Though the majority of the detected domains are already alarmed by SOC and VirusTotal (132 for threshold 0.33), only 13 are reported in the IOC list, and the remaining ones are unknown to the enterprise. More interestingly, we identified many new malicious and suspicious domains not known to the community (a total of 70 new domains for threshold 0.33, resulting in an NDR of 26.4%). This result suggests that our detector could complement existing security tools by discovering new suspicious activities. Its main advantage is its ability to detect new campaigns without traces of known malicious behavior.
