### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, spanning from 18:09:34 to 18:09:40 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues and events within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and the Resource Manager (RM) components. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process, associated with the user `msrabi` on host `msra-sa-41:9000`, repeatedly fails to renew the lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failure durations range from 277 to 282 seconds.
   - Each failed attempt is followed by a message indicating that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Address Changes:**
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes detect address changes. Specifically:
     - The `LeaseRenewer` process detects a change from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
     - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process detects a change from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.

3. **RM Communication Issues:**
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process encounters errors while trying to contact the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system retries connecting to the server, following a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each retry.
   - Each retry attempt is logged as an `INFO` message, and the subsequent failure is logged as an `ERROR` message.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **18:09:34:** 
  - `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 277 seconds.
  
- **18:09:35:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` detects an address change for the RM server.
  - `LeaseRenewer` detects an address change for its own process.
  - `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 278 seconds.

- **18:09:36:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the RM server, with 0 attempts so far.
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs an error in contacting the RM.
  - `LeaseRenewer` detects another address change.
  - `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 279 seconds.

- **18:09:37:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` detects another address change.
  - `LeaseRenewer` detects another address change.
  - `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 280 seconds.

- **18:09:38:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the RM server, with 0 attempts so far.
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs an error in contacting the RM.
  - `LeaseRenewer` detects another address change.
  - `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 281 seconds.

- **18:09:39:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` detects another address change.
  - `LeaseRenewer` detects another address change.
  - `LeaseRenewer` fails to renew the lease for 282 seconds.

- **18:09:40:**
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` retries connecting to the RM server, with 0 attempts so far.
  - `RMCommunicator Allocator` logs an error in contacting the RM.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with lease renewal and resource manager communication, likely due to the detected address changes. The system is configured to retry these operations, but the repeated failures suggest a potential network or configuration issue that needs to be addressed.
