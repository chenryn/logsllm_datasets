### Reason analyze (If you can)
This pr(https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/pull/2119/files)
add setCurrentSchema() which will throw exception when a transaction is not
terminated.
### Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule
configuration, when exception occur etc.
### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).
