σ2 = {10−5, 10}. Only coeﬃcient values above 10−2 are shown for clarity. Note the log scale of the y-axis. The MGM is
single rank, while the NCIM is almost full rank, with a handful of coeﬃcients possessing large magnitudes.
same duration as before. All other constraints are de-
layed relative to the NY PoP. For instance, the traﬃc of
the Los Angeles (LA) PoP, is delayed by 3 hours, since
LA time is 3 hours behind NY time. The row and col-
umn sums are scaled by ri/˜r and cj/˜c, ∀i, j, since time
averages ri and cj are known. Conservation of traﬃc
implies ¯s(tk) =Pi ri(tk) =Pj cj(tk).
Both models’ spatial and temporal variations are con-
trolled through σ2, by setting Σr = Σc = σ2IN and
p = σ2.
σ2
Intuitively, we expect the MGM to be rank-1, so it
would be too simple to replicate the properties of real
traﬃc. The NCIM would then be a better choice since
it would still be low-rank, but with enough variations
to approximate a real TM process, since real TMs are
unlikely to be rank-1.
Figure 3 shows the coeﬃcients of the PCA compo-
nents of the MGM and the NCIM with σ2 = {10−5, 10}.
For the MGM, we ﬁnd that only the ﬁrst component
(with the largest score) has a strong cyclic behavior.
Though not shown here, the cyclic behavior persisted
to more than one component for the NCIM, which is
closer to real traﬃc (such as Abilene’s) compared to
the MGM. Smaller components of both models behave
similar to white noise, e.g., the smallest component in
Figure 3(c).
In Figure 3(b), once σ2 = 10, we now ﬁnd larger
variation in the coeﬃcient magnitudes of both models,
though the diurnal cycles are still identiﬁable. Smaller
components are also much noisier. Clearly, the models’
components have parallels to the cyclic and noise-like
components of OD ﬂows [19, 20].
Figure 4 plots the spatial PCA coeﬃcients of mod-
els. The contrast between both models is evident: the
MGM is rank-1, as expected, while the NCIM has a
larger rank. Incidentally, the largest coeﬃcient of both
588models coincide with the contribution from the average
gravity component ¯r¯cT/T . The NCIM’s rank increases
as σ2 increases because σ2 increases the variety of gen-
erated TMs. We omitted showing the temporal PCA
coeﬃcients as they match the spatial coeﬃcients 3.
What’s interesting here is that just diﬀerences in phase
between the row and column sums lead to a larger rank,
rather than the addition of new traﬃc classes. This may
explain the low-rank (but not single rank) behavior of
real TMs observed by [19, 20, 48]. This relatively sim-
ple model reproduces complex properties such as cycles,
noise-like components and low-rank behavior.
Overall, the NCIM’s properties are closer to that of
real TMs than the MGM, but clearly require more de-
tailed information, i.e., the PoP locations.
5. CASE STUDY
In our case study, we apply our TM synthesis method-
ology to PoP-level network topology generation.
Real world PoP-level topologies are far from random,
as these topologies are designed depending on various
factors [21] such as demographic and geographical con-
straints, traﬃc demand, the designer’s experience, and
ﬁnancial costs. Real designs have large variability, with
some as simple as a hub-and-spoke network, to more
complex and meshy ones [17]. They generally do not
reﬂect the properties of random graphs, such as the
Erd¨os-R´enyi [13] model, so a realistic topology gener-
ator must account for the above-mentioned factors.
Topology design requires the TM as an input as it
determines the capacity of the links of a network. A
popular choice is the gravity model [45], with several
works employing a single instance of it [5, 21, 49].
First, we ask if using a series of TMs can help im-
prove a network’s robustness. “Robustness” here refers
to robustness to TM variation, not network survival un-
der node removals. Second, a key result of [5] was that
topology design is largely unaﬀected by certain facets
of TMs. However, their algorithm, Combined Opti-
mized Layered Design (COLD), used the random grav-
ity model [31]. We extend their work by using a wider
range of TMs.
We modiﬁed COLD to accept a series of TMs by
deﬁning a new optimization scheme, though this new
scheme is general enough to be applied elsewhere. As
far as we are aware, there is no other work on designing
topologies using a series of TMs with prescribed spa-
tiotemporal properties.
Topology generation involves combinatorial optimiza-
tion, so COLD applies a genetic algorithm as a heuristic
to solve for the topology with the minimum cost, based
on a function with four cost parameters:
• k0-cost: cost for the existence of a link,
• k1-cost: cost for the physical length of a link,
3Spatial and temporal PCA are singular value decom-
positions performed on YYT and YTY respectively.
• k2-cost: the bandwidth cost over the length of the
link, factoring in operating expenses, initial expendi-
tures on equipment etc., and
• k3-cost: complexity cost of a PoP with more than one
link, called a non-leaf or core PoP.
Let G(N, E) be the set of all undirected graphs with
N nodes and E links with suﬃcient capacity to carry
the traﬃc. Let NC be the set of non-leaf nodes i.e.,
degree > 1 and w := {wi | i ∈ E} be the bandwidth of
the links in E. We test the minimax scheme, i.e.,
min
G(N,E)
max
w∈W(X )Xi∈E(cid:16)k0 + k1ℓi + k2ℓiwi(cid:17) + k3|NC|,
where W(X ) is the space of all possible link loads com-
puted over X , via OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
routing. The minimax scheme seems like an improve-
ment as it factors in a range of TMs. We test this below.
5.1 Experiments and results
We ﬁrst ﬁx the locations of the PoPs in a 10 unit
by 10 unit square with N = 12 PoPs, so randomness
only enters via the input TMs. We then generated a
week’s worth of 5 minute interval TMs (M = 2, 016)
via the MGM (see §4.3) as input for COLD with the
recommended settings [4].
We also tested minimax with the Independent Entries
Model (IEM) with the constraint E[Xi,j(tk)] = α ¯X to
control the size of each entry. Note that we tested the
model with α = 1, 2, 4, but all results were similar, so
results from α = 1 were omitted.
The NCIM discussed in §4.3 was tested too, but we
obtained similar results to the MGM, so its results were
omitted. We explain the reasons for this below.
We deﬁned the single peak scheme, where only the
TM with the largest total traﬃc out of the M TMs
is chosen as input in the topology design process, to
compete against the minimax scheme.
We measured the Global Clustering Coeﬃcient (GCC)
of the topologies generated by the schemes. The GCC
is a metric on how well-connected (clustered) a PoP is
to its neighbors. The more well-connected, the more
choices OSPF has in routing traﬃc ﬂows. The network
would then be more robust to variations in the TM.
Figure 5 show the GCC for the minimax and single
peak schemes under the MGM with σ2 = 10−5, and the
minimax scheme via the IEM with α = 2. Cost k0 = 5
and k1 = 1, while k3 = {0.1, 1, 10}. Each data point on
k2 = {0, 0.1, 1, 10, 102, 103} is an average of 20 trials.
The GCCs of minimax and the single peak schemes
(under the MGM) almost match. As k2 increases, the
diﬀerence between minimax and the single peak almost
vanishes as both topologies become clique-like. The
GCC for the IEM is lower with larger variance, espe-
cially at low k2. Even when σ2 = 10 and α = 4 in
Figure 6, results were similar. We also computed other
statistics such as the average shortest paths which de-
creases for all schemes and models as k2 increases. How-
