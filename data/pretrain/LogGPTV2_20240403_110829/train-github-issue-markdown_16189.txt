When creating or modifying a zone, it would be helpful to have the size in pixels (width x height) clearly displayed. Specifically, when defining a new zone, I would like to see the exact number of pixels in both the X and Y dimensions. For example, on a large monitor with a resolution of 3840 x 2160, I might want to create a zone that is 1920 x 1080 pixels.
