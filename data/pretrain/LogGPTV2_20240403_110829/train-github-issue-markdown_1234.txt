  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Generated sizes include the type of unit, so it's not up to the interpreter to
add missing information.
    padding: {
        paddingTop: {theme.spacing.unit}px,
        paddingBottom: {theme.spacing.unit}px,
      },
## Current Behavior
Currently, a few calculated sizes in the code base are missing the type of
unit. For example in https://github.com/mui-org/material-
ui/blob/v1-beta/src/List/List.js
    padding: {
        paddingTop: theme.spacing.unit,
        paddingBottom: theme.spacing.unit,
      },
It might be our setup, but at production Firefox and Chrome are complaining
about the missing unit type. This is correct as the inspector shows:
    .c56 {
        padding-top: 8;
        padding-bottom: 8;
    }
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
The issue is hard to track down as I am not a developer; however it does not
occur at our development environments. This leads me to believe it's going
wrong during `npm build` somewhere in our webpack stack.
Adding the unit types would however bypass the issue all together imho.
