5. CANNIBALIZING ORGANIC TRAFFIC
We refer to the scenario where advertisers show ads for queries
where they have an organic presence as cannibalization: in the ab-
sence of ads, users could have navigated to the advertiser using
organic results. We consider three particular scenarios of cannibal-
ization and use NAB to measure the beneﬁts of each. We ﬁnd that,
i) for queries where the advertiser is the top result 56% of the adver-
tisers derive no beneﬁt from advertising, ii) the incremental beneﬁt
of advertising increases as the organic rank of advertiser decreases
and iii) over 61% of the advertisers achieve limited beneﬁt by ad-
vertising on navigational queries.
5.1 Improving visibility
In this section we consider the general case of searches where
the user does not already have a particular destination website (ad-
vertiser) in mind. In such an instance, even though an advertiser’s

vertising on queries where advertiser is the top result.
site appears in the organic search results, the advertiser may wish to
increase its visibility to induce the user to visit its site as opposed
to a competitor’s. We consider an advertiser to be attempting to
improve their visibility if the advertiser chooses to display an ad
despite already being included in the organic results likely to be
considered by the user (i.e., ranked in the top ten organic results
which are chosen based on their relevance to the user query).
Same-query visibility
5.1.1
The main challenge in measuring the impact of advertising is
obtaining comparable search impressions. In the ideal scenario we
would compare user actions in the presence and absence of an ad
while everything else remains the same. Since we do not have such
data, we compare the performance of ads by comparing beneﬁts
of advertising over two sets of impressions for the same query,
one with ads and one without ads. Comparing user actions over
impressions for the same query ensures that the most signiﬁcant
variable—the user query—remains the same in both sample sets.
We begin by considering the effectiveness of advertising when an
advertiser is already the top organic search result. For each (adver-
tiser, query) pair, where advertiser is the top organic result for that

query, we identify impressions with and without ads by the adver-
tiser. I.e., a single advertiser may be considered multiple times if
they are the top search result for more than one query. Figure 4
plots the NAB of advertising (query-org-1-ad) vs. not advertis-
ing (query-org-1-noad) for all (advertiser, query) pairs where we
have more than 30 conversions (as discussed in Section 4). In our
dataset, we have 824 (advertiser, query) pairs covering 345 distinct
advertisers. The diagonal line represents an INAB of zero, i.e., the
effectiveness of advertising is equivalent to the effectiveness of not
advertising for that advertiser. Advertising is more effective than
not for advertisers above the diagonal. A slight majority are below
the line where the inverse is true—i.e., it is not worth advertising
for that query. The dashed red curves above and below the diago-
nal are intended to aide comparison as the graph spans four orders
of magnitude on each axis: they represent a ∆NAB (NAB(ad) -
NAB(noad)) of +0.01 and −0.01 respectively.
As an alternative representation of the same data, Figure 5 plots
the CDF of the corresponding INAB metric. Recall that INAB is
normalized to the NAB of the base strategy, so a value of 1.0 repre-
sents a 2× improvement. For 56% of the (advertiser, query) pairs
the corresponding advertiser gets zero or negative incremental ben-
eﬁt by advertising on the query (i.e., fall below the diagonal in Fig-
ure 4). Again, this means that these advertisers should reconsider
advertising on those queries.
5.1.2 Over all queries
The constraint of comparing the beneﬁts of advertising by hold-
ing the user query a constant limits our analysis to a few advertis-
ers who have signiﬁcant number of conversions for the same query.
Even for those advertisers, these few queries contribute to a small
proportion of their entire ad spend. Hence, there is reason to be-
lieve the same-query results may not be representative. By design,
we can apply our metric to measure effectiveness of ads on an arbi-
trary slice of trafﬁc. Here we expand our analysis to compare trafﬁc
slices where the advertiser has a particular rank in organic results,
irrespective of user query.
Figure 6 considers only non-navigational queries (i.e., those
where the user likely does not have a particular destination website
in mind) and plots NAB of advertising (org-n-ad) vs. not advertis-
ing (org-n-noad) aggregated across all queries for each advertiser
(i.e., each advertiser is a single data point) where we have sufﬁcient
data as described in Section 4. We separate campaigns based upon
their rank in organic results. Figure 6(a) considers the aggregate
performance of all non-navigational queries for which an advertiser
Figure 7: As rank increases in organic results beneﬁts of cannibal-
istic advertising turn positive, albeit only slightly.
anyway obtains the top organic result (c.f. Figure 4 which shows a
distinct point for each unique top-result-producing query an adver-
tiser may obtain). Figures 6(b) and 6(c) show the same comparison
for campaigns where the advertiser appears third or ﬁfth in organic
search results, respectively.
Figure 7 plots the CDFs of the corresponding INAB metrics
for each of the three classes of campaign considered in Figure 6.
In contrast to the same-query results above, most of the advertis-
ers gain by advertising for non-navigational queries despite be-
ing present in the organic results. This is likely because non-
navigational queries tend to be competed for more aggressively and
users are ﬂexible with choosing any business that meets their needs.
Also, while the relative beneﬁt (i.e., INAB) of advertising increase
as the organic rank drops, the absolute beneﬁts (i.e., NAB) of ad-
vertising are very low.
Interestingly, for 32% of the top-ranked websites, there appear
to be signiﬁcant beneﬁts to advertising (INAB > 50%). Manual
investigations ﬁnd that these advertisers belong to two categories.
One set of advertisers have less-well-recognized brands. If a more
well recognized brand advertises for the query, and is thus placed
above the top-ranked organic result, the latter lose out. The other
category of advertisers who gain are those who share their brand
with other advertisers. For example, car manufacturers lose poten-
tial converting users to competing ads placed by car dealers trying
to attract the same users. For 19% of the top-ranked websites, ad-
vertising is a drain on their ad spend (INAB  25%).
Our ﬁnding that 61% of advertisers receive limited bene-
ﬁt (INAB approximately zero) from advertising on navigational
queries vs. not advertising squarely contradicts reports from other
ad networks that suggest 89% of ad clicks are incremental, and
would be lost without advertising [13]. We reconcile these results
by observing that the previous study [13] does not consider con-
versions and focuses solely on clicks. Indeed, the study’s authors
explicitly state that advertisers should consider conversions since
relying on clicks alone may be misleading. We show below that ad-
vertising on navigational queries does, in fact, inﬂate click counts
without increasing conversions for the vast majority of advertisers.
Another reason for the divergent result is that the previous study
considers campaigns that are paused due to budget shortage. This
would bias the choice of campaigns towards very small advertisers
who would not have strong presence for navigational queries.
For advertisers that value conversions, however, our data discred-
its conventional wisdom that promotes advertising on navigational
queries for which the advertiser is the top organic result. Finally,
while our general ﬁnding is consistent with experimental evidence
from large advertisers including eBay [10], we nevertheless encour-
age advertisers to conduct their own experiments and track conver-
sions to determine if they belong to the small (9%) set of advertis-
ers for whom advertising on navigational queries brings signiﬁcant
beneﬁts. These advertisers, as we discussed in Section 5.1.2, either
have a weaker brand or are competing against other advertisers who
can legitimately advertise on their brand.
5.3 Click count inﬂation
Many advertisers appear to optimize for clicks rather than con-
versions. While we can only speculate as to why they choose to do
so, anecdotal evidence ranges from naïveté, e.g., unawareness of
metrics other than the click-through rate, to ﬁnancial, e.g., ad agen-
cies that collect commission per-click and advertisers that specify
CTRs and minimum click counts (rather than conversions) in con-
tracts with such agencies [3]. One of the easiest ways for advertis-
ers to inﬂate ad click counts is to cannibalize the advertiser’s own
navigational queries.
Figure 9 plots achieved click-through rate of campaigns that ad-
vertise on an advertiser’s own navigational queries as a function
of their INAB. While the INAB of such a strategy is close to zero
for the vast majority of campaigns as one would expect, the click-
through rate for these campaigns is extremely high as compared to
typical search ad CTRs of around 1-2% [5]. Advertisers should run

Figure 8: The incremental beneﬁt of advertising for navigational
queries is very small for most advertisers.
5.2 Navigational queries
A subset of queries (explicitly excluded above) for which an ad-
vertiser is the top organic result is known as navigational queries—
i.e., the user is using the search engine as a way to navigate to the
advertiser’s site. We consider a given query navigational for an ad-
vertiser if: i) the search query is classiﬁed by the search ad network
as navigational, i.e., the user query includes branded terms or key-
words (e.g., Amazon or Facebook) that suggests the user is seeking
a speciﬁc website, and ii) the advertiser is the top-most organic re-
sult for that query. Here, we consider whether it is effective for a
website to advertise for queries where the user is explicitly seeking
to navigate to the advertiser website.
Figure 8(a) plots the NAB of advertising (nav-ad) versus not
advertising (nav-noad) for all advertisers where we have at least
30 conversions attributed to clicks following queries matching the
