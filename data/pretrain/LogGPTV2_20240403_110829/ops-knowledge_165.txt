Question: When designing a new cryptographic system that requires random number generation, which of the following approaches should you consider to ensure that the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) used provides adequate entropy?
"A": "Implement a PRNG that re-seeds itself periodically using a hardware-based source of entropy.",
"B": "Select a PRNG that strictly adheres to FIPS 140-2 standards, with particular emphasis on the guidance provided in Annex C.",
"C": "Opt for a PRNG that provides a predictable amount of strength and avoids failing in a weak manner even if it does not always use strong random data.",
"D": "Design the system to use a PRNG that relies solely on software-based entropy sources, as they are more predictable and easier to manage."
Answer: ABC
