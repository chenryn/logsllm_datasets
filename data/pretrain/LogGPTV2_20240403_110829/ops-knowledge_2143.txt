**User:**
Are there any recommendations for converting `.doc`, `.ppt`, and `.xls` files to plain text on Linux using Python? Any method of conversion would be helpful. I have already considered using OpenOffice, but I am looking for a solution that does not require installing OpenOffice.

**Assistant:**
I've had success using XSLT to process XML-based office files into a usable format in the past. While this approach is not strictly Python-based, it can effectively handle the conversion. 

For a Python-specific solution, you might consider using libraries like `python-docx` for `.doc` files, `python-pptx` for `.ppt` files, and `xlrd` or `openpyxl` for `.xls` and `.xlsx` files, respectively. These libraries allow you to read the content of these files and then extract the text.

Here are some examples:

1. **For `.doc` files:**
   ```python
   from docx import Document

   def convert_doc_to_text(file_path):
       document = Document(file_path)
       text = '\n'.join([paragraph.text for paragraph in document.paragraphs])
       return text
   ```

2. **For `.ppt` files:**
   ```python
   from pptx import Presentation

   def convert_ppt_to_text(file_path):
       presentation = Presentation(file_path)
       text = ''
       for slide in presentation.slides:
           for shape in slide.shapes:
               if hasattr(shape, "text"):
                   text += shape.text + '\n'
       return text
   ```

3. **For `.xls` and `.xlsx` files:**
   ```python
   import xlrd

   def convert_xls_to_text(file_path):
       workbook = xlrd.open_workbook(file_path)
       text = ''
       for sheet in workbook.sheets():
           for row in range(sheet.nrows):
               for col in range(sheet.ncols):
                   text += str(sheet.cell(row, col).value) + ' '
               text += '\n'
       return text
   ```

These methods should help you convert the files to plain text without needing to install additional software like OpenOffice.
