We group related schemes into categories. For space reasons, in the present paper, we describe at most one representative scheme per category; the companion technical report [1] discusses all schemes listed.

#### Comparative Evaluation of the Various Schemes Examined

**Password Managers:**
Password managers, such as Firefox [42] and LastPass [5], can significantly enhance usability by managing an ever-increasing number of accounts (Scalable-for-Users). However, the underlying technology still relies on static, user-chosen passwords, which are replayable and vulnerable to attacks.

**Federated Schemes:**
Federated schemes, like OpenID [43], Microsoft Passport [44], and Facebook Connect [46], are challenging to evaluate. Security is good if authentication to the identity provider (IP) uses a strong method, such as one-time passwords or tokens. However, this often results in poor usability. If the IP relies on passwords, the security improvement is minimal. Federated schemes thus serve more as placeholders rather than complete solutions.

**Graphical Passwords:**
Graphical passwords can match text passwords in terms of usability and offer some security gains. However, they are still replayable and not Resilient-to-Internal-Observation. While they have been adopted for device access control on touchscreen devices, their advantages are insufficient to displace traditional passwords for remote web authentication.

**Cognitive Schemes:**
Cognitive schemes, such as URRSA [23] and Impostor [27], show slight improvements in security but with worse usability. These schemes aim to be Resilient-to-Internal-Observation, but current implementations are limited. The inherent limitations of cognitive schemes suggest that they may remain primarily of academic interest.

**Hardware Tokens and Paper Tokens:**
Schemes using hardware tokens, paper tokens, and phone-based methods, such as RSA SecurID [53], Yubikey [54], and Pico [8], excel in security. Most are Resilient-to-Internal-Observation and outperform other classes. However, their usability drawbacks, such as not being Scalable-for-Users, Nothing-to-Carry, or Efficient-to-Use, and their high cost, limit their widespread adoption. Less usable schemes are more common in environments where user acceptance is less critical, such as employee accounts or government sites.

**Biometric Schemes:**
Biometric schemes, including fingerprint, iris, and voice recognition, have mixed usability scores and generally perform poorly in deployability and security. Physical biometrics are inherently non-Resilient-to-Internal-Observation and lack Easy-Recovery-from-Loss. Malware capturing a digital representation of a biometric, such as an iris, can render it unusable in unsupervised environments. While biometrics are suitable for physical access control, they are less suitable for unsupervised web authentication due to the lack of a trusted input path and means to verify live samples.

**Extending the Benefits List:**
Our list of benefits is not exhaustive. Future evaluations should consider additional security goals, such as resistance to active-man-in-the-middle and relay attacks. Continuous authentication, providing ongoing assurances rather than just session start, is another important benefit. Positive user affectation, or how pleasant users find a scheme, is a standard usability metric that should also be included in future studies.
