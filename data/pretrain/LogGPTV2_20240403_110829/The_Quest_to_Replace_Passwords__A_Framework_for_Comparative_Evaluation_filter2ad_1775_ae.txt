We group related schemes into categories. For space reasons, in the present paper we describe at most one representative
scheme per category; the companion technical report [1] discusses all schemes listed.
COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF THE VARIOUS SCHEMES WE EXAMINED

losing much. They could become a staple of users’ coping
strategies if passwords remain widespread, enabling as a ma-
jor advantage the management of an ever-increasing number
of accounts (Scalable-for-Users). However, the underlying
technology remains replayable, static (mainly user-chosen)
passwords.
Federated schemes are particularly hard to grade. Propo-
nents note that security is good if authentication to the iden-
tity provider (IP) is done with a strong scheme (e.g., one-
time passwords or tokens). However in this case usability is
inherited from that scheme and is generally poor, per Table
I. This also reduces federated schemes to be a placeholder
for a solution rather than a solution itself. If authentication
to the IP relies on passwords, then the resulting security is
only a little better than that of passwords themselves (with
fewer password entry instances exposed to attack).
Graphical passwords can approach text passwords on us-
ability criteria, offering some security gain, but static secrets
are replayable and not Resilient-to-Internal-Observation.
Despite adoption for device access-control on some touch-
screen mobile devices, for remote web authentication the
advantages appear insufﬁcient to generally displace a ﬁrmly-
entrenched incumbent.
Cognitive schemes show slender improvement on the
security of passwords, in return for worse usability. While
to achieve Resilient-to-Internal-
several schemes attempt
Observation, to date none succeed: the secret may withstand
one observation or two [61], but seldom more than a
handful [62]. The apparently inherent limitations [63], [64]
of cognitive schemes to date lead one to question if the
category can rise above one of purely academic interest.
The hardware token, paper token and phone-based cate-
gories of schemes fare very well in security, e.g., most in
Table I are Resilient-to-Internal-Observation, easily beating
other classes. However, that S/KEY and SecurID have been
around for decades and have failed to slow down the
inexorable rise of passwords suggests that their drawbacks
in usability (e.g., not Scalable-for-Users, nor Nothing-to-
Carry, nor Efﬁcient-to-Use) and deployability (e.g., hard-
ware tokens are not Negligible-Cost-per-User) should not be
over-looked. Less usable schemes can always be mandated,
but this is more common in situations where a site has a
de facto monopoly (e.g., employee accounts or government
sites) than where user acceptance matters. Experience shows
that the large web-sites that compete for both trafﬁc and
users are reluctant to risk bad usability [16]. Schemes that
are less usable than passwords face an uphill battle in such
environments.
Biometric schemes have mixed scores on our usability
metrics, and do poorly in deployability and security. As
a major issue, physical biometrics being inherently non-
Resilient-to-Internal-Observation is seriously compounded
by biometrics missing Easy-Recovery-from-Loss as well,
with re-issuance impossible [9]. Thus, e.g., if malware cap-
tures the digital representation of a user’s iris, possible replay
makes the biometric no longer suitable in unsupervised
environments. Hence despite security features appropriate
to control access to physical locations under the supervision
of suitable personnel, biometrics aren’t well suited for un-
supervised web authentication where client devices lack a
trusted input path and means to verify that samples are live.
B. Extending the beneﬁts list
Our list of beneﬁts is not complete, and indeed, any such
list could always be expanded. We did not include resistance
to active-man-in-the-middle, which a few examined schemes
may provide, or to relay attacks, which probably none of
them do. However, tracking all security goals, whether met
or not, is important and considering beneﬁts that indicate
resistance to these (and additional) attacks is worthwhile.
Continuous authentication (with ongoing assurances
rather than just at session start, thereby addressing session
hijacking) is a beneﬁt worth considering, although a goal of
few current schemes. Positive user affectation (how pleasant
users perceive use of a scheme to be) is a standard usability
metric we omitted; unfortunately, the literature currently
