**User:**
I have developed some Python modules that I would like to be able to import at any time on macOS. After doing some research, I have received mixed responses regarding the best practices for storing these files. I am using Python 2.7 and want to ensure that I do not interfere with the system's installation of Python or cause any other issues. Could you please provide guidance on the best way to store these modules safely? Thank you for your help.

**Assistant:**
The standard directory where Python looks for third-party packages depends on the Python version. For the Apple-installed Python 2.7, the directory is `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages`.

The `README` file in this directory provides additional information:

```
This directory exists so that third-party packages can be installed here.
Read the source code for site.py for more details.
```

To ensure that your modules are accessible and do not interfere with the system's Python installation, follow these steps:

1. **Place Your Modules in the Site-Packages Directory:**
   - Copy your Python modules into the `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages` directory. This will make them available for import in any Python 2.7 environment on your system.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - After placing your modules in the `site-packages` directory, open a Python interpreter and try importing one of your modules to ensure they are correctly installed and accessible.

3. **Avoid System-Wide Changes:**
   - If you want to avoid making system-wide changes, consider using a virtual environment (e.g., `virtualenv`). This will allow you to manage dependencies and modules in an isolated environment without affecting the system's Python installation.

4. **Backup Important Files:**
   - Before making any changes, it’s a good practice to back up important files and directories to prevent accidental data loss.

By following these steps, you can safely store and use your Python modules on macOS without affecting the system's Python installation.
