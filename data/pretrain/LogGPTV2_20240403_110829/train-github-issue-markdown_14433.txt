When you are typing on iOS, every time you hit a character the cursor is
supposed to stop blinking. In a Flutter app, the cursor keeps blinking while
you are typing, which is extremely distracting and a tad bit disconcerting as
you can momentarily lose track of the text that is being inserted.
(Interestingly, if you backspace the Flutter cursor does reset: it is only
incorrect when taking forward motion.)
