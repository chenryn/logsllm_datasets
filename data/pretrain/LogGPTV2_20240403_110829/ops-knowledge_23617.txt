User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Centos 6.10 - Mount Backup Disk with Single partition My disk failed and required replacement. I backed up my data on anther disk and the hosting company removed it prior to replacing corrupted disk. Now I have a fresh install (Centos 6.10) and would like to mount the backup disk "sdb". I'm not able to do so as the disk is entirely a single partition.
The command doesnt work:

[root@PGE005 ~]# mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb /mnt/disk2
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so




Model: ATA MB0500EBNCR (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 500GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B

My backup disk is sdb. The hosting provider support said it seems that there is  a compatibility issue between the partition formatter and the mounter.
I appreciate any support or ideas that will help me mount the backup disk.

Edit:

[root@pge005 ~]# dmesg | tail
EXT4-fs (sdb): couldn't mount RDWR because of unsupported optional features (400)

Assistant: The message from dmsg is most helpful. I found several posts about this error, the most promising being on unix.se.
Quotes from there:

The error &quot;EXT4-fs : couldn't mount RDWR because of unsupported optional features (400)&quot; is due to different versions between the partition formatter (mkfs.ext4) and the mounter.
You have two options:
a) Either you have to upgrade the mounter program using a newer distro inside the SD-card.
b) or you have to backup the files, reformat the SD-card with the same distro (the same ext4 versions) you are doing the mounting, and after the reformat copy the files again to the SD-card.

The answer with the most upvotes has this additional tip:

The ext4 feature (400) is the new metadata_csum feature. If this feature is enabled and old tools are used to mount the filesystem they will only be able to mount read-only.

(highlight by me).
Since you basically want to restore your backup, I'd give this a try and mount the disk read only.
mount -t ext4 -o ro /dev/sdb /mnt/disk2
