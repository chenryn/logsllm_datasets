User: I'm using python's subprocess module to interact with a program via the stdin and stdout pipes.  If I call the subprocesses readline() on stdout, it hangs because it is waiting for a newline.
How can I do a read of all the characters in the stdout pipe of a subprocess instance?  If it matters, I'm running in Linux.
Assistant: You should loop using read() against a set number of characters.
