If using `trackBy`/`ngForTrackBy` to track the addition/removal of an element
to the array being iterated in `ngFor`, it appears the elements are actually
redrawn rather than re-ordered. I'm using 2.0.0-beta.14.
Issue can be seen here using the network/Docs tab in chrome console:

Open the Network tab and then remove one of the Heroes near the top of the
list. Every hero item below that one will be redrawn, as seen by the iframe
being reloaded. This behavior can be repoduced without an iframe present, but
this makes it easier to see the behavior.
It's possible that I misunderstood the functionality of `trackBy`, but it was
my understanding that it would leave elements in place if they retained the
same reference property from the custom track-by function.
**EDIT** : I previously thought that the iframes were triggered by a reflow
and this somehow caused their content to refresh, but that's apparently not
always the case. This plunker recreates the functionality of adding a node
with an iframe child, but the other iframes don't reload their content. It
appears that ngTrackBy may not fully be working in 2.0.0-beta.14.
