##### Description of the problem
nPOT textures can be swapped during the uploading process if the textures were
already in Browser Cache.
##### Repeating of the problem
  * Open this link in Chrome on Android device.
  * Toilets must be bottom of screen, baths must be on top of screen.
  * Reload some page
  * Now bath and toilets mixed on both sides (or may be only baths, or only toilets)
##### Simple fix
Adding `var _canvas` in this line fixes it.
One more possible (unconfirmed) fix: use `createImageBitmap` on Image before
doing the resize.
It seems that `texImage2d` somehow doesnt get update from that canvas in time.
