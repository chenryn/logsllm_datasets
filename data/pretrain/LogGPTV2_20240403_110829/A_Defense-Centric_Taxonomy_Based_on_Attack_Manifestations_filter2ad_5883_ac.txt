### Hypothesis

The hypothesis of this study is that the class to which an attack belongs can predict whether a particular intrusion-detection system (IDS) will detect a given attack. This prediction is based on the presence or absence of specific features, which are used as taxonomic classes.

### Features and Precedence

- The features are not mutually exclusive; for example, a manifestation can contain both foreign symbols and minimal foreign sequences.
- There is a precedence among the taxonomic classes, reflecting the difficulty of detection:
  - **Foreign Symbol (FS)**: Takes precedence over minimal foreign sequences.
  - **Minimal Foreign Sequence (MFS)**: Takes precedence over dormant sequences.
  - **Dormant Sequence (DS)**: Takes precedence over sequences with no anomalies.
  - **No Anomalies (MNA)**: If an attack contains no foreign symbols, sequences, or dormant sequences, it is classified as not anomalous.

### Decision Procedure for Classifying Attacks

1. **Class 1 (FS)**: If an attack’s manifestation contains one or more foreign symbols, classify it as a foreign symbol.
2. **Class 2 (MFS)**: If an attack’s manifestation contains no foreign symbols but does contain one or more minimal foreign sequences, classify it as a minimal foreign sequence.
3. **Class 3 (DS)**: If an attack’s manifestation contains no foreign symbols or sequences but does contain a dormant sequence, classify it as a dormant sequence.
4. **Class 4 (MNA)**: If an attack’s manifestation contains no foreign symbols, sequences, or dormant sequences, classify it as not anomalous.

### Classification of Attacks

For each of the twenty-five attacks in this study, the features were identified. Table 6 lists each attack, with the presence or absence of the four features denoted by marks in the appropriate columns. Using the decision procedure, the class to which each attack belongs was determined and listed in the fifth column of Table 6.

### Validation of Taxonomic Rules

The new defense-centric taxonomy should meet the following criteria:
1. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Each attack can only belong to one class.
2. **Exhaustivity**: Every attack must belong to one of the classes.
3. **Replicability**: Different evaluators should consistently assign the same class to the same attack.

#### Theoretical Evidence

- **Mutual Exclusivity**: The decision procedure ensures that an attack cannot be classified into more than one class.
- **Exhaustivity**: The decision procedure ensures that every attack is assigned to one of the four classes.
- **Replicability**: The language of the decision procedure is unambiguous, ensuring consistent classification.

#### Empirical Evidence

- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Confirmed that none of the attacks belonged to multiple classes.
- **Exhaustivity**: Confirmed that all attacks belonged to one of the four classes.
- **Replicability**: Confirmed that diverse classifications (e.g., different tools, different evaluators) produced the same results.

### Validation Using IDS Evidence

The utility of the taxonomy was determined by running all 25 attacks through the Stide anomaly-based IDS. Stide was configured with a locality frame of 1 and a detector window size varied from 1 to 15. The scoring system was as follows:
- **Score 3**: Always detectable (anomalies reported at all window sizes).
- **Score 2**: Sometimes detectable (anomalies reported at some window sizes).
- **Score 1**: Never detectable (no anomalies reported at any window size).

The results, shown in the last column of Table 6, confirmed that the taxonomy accurately predicted the performance of the IDS.

### Comparison with Attack-Centric Taxonomy

To validate the claim that a defense-centric taxonomy is a better predictor of detector performance, the Lincoln Laboratory's attack-centric taxonomy [16] was selected for comparison. The Lincoln taxonomy is well-known and classifies attacks based on the attacker’s goal.

- **Mutual Exclusivity and Replicability**: The Lincoln taxonomy met these criteria.
- **Exhaustivity**: Four of the 25 attacks did not fit the Lincoln taxonomy:
  - **slocateheap** and **xmanprivs**: Elevate privileges to a system-level user.
  - **crontabrace** and **diskcheckrace**: Create files in unauthorized locations.

To address this, a fifth class, "System access / Alter data," was added to the Lincoln taxonomy, allowing for a more comprehensive classification.
