Question: "A web application allows users to upload images for profile customization. The application's upload feature is currently configured to accept any file type, relying on the client-side extension check. As a security consultant, you are tasked with recommending a remediation strategy to prevent the upload of potentially malicious files. Which of the following strategies should be implemented to enhance the security of the file upload feature?"
 "A": "Implement server-side validation to ensure only image file types (.jpg, .png, .gif) are processed, and use a file type recognizer to verify the content."
 "B": "Rely solely on client-side JavaScript validation to check the file extension, as this is sufficient to prevent malicious file uploads."
 "C": "Accept all file types but sandbox the uploaded files in a secure environment where they can be executed safely without affecting the server."
 "D": "Allow the upload of .html and .php files but rename them on the server to prevent execution."
Answer: A
