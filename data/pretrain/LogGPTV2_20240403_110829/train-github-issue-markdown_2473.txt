To obtain ODE solvers similar to `ode23` and `ode45` in MATLAB, you can use the RKSuite available at:
- [RKSuite](http://www.netlib.org/ode/rksuite/)

For more advanced and state-of-the-art solvers, consider using SUNDIALS, which is widely used in national laboratories. SUNDIALS provides a solver equivalent to MATLAB's `ode15s`. However, it is important to note that SUNDIALS is no longer actively maintained, as its lead developer has moved on to the video game industry.

In the long term, a viable strategy might be to implement these solvers directly in Julia. The design and architecture of the MATLAB ODE suite are detailed in the following document:
