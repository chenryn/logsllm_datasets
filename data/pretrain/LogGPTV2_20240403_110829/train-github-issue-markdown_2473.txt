A quick and easy way to get ode23 and ode45 like in MATLAB is:

The state of the art is SUNDIALS, but it is no longer maintained. The lead
developer went to develop video games! It is widely used in the national labs,
and can give us ode15s.

The long term strategy may simply be to implement these solvers in julia
itself. The design of the Matlab ODE suite is described in:
