shown in Tab. II. The whole process will be recorded by iPhone
6Plus, Galaxy S6, OPPO Reno2, OPPO Reno3 and then we
collect 500 voice samples. We also use Google Text-to-Speech
(TTS) engine to generate the ﬁve voice commands, which will
be used in the following experiments. We process the sound
samples ofﬂine in Python 3.7.
Environments. All the experiments are conducted in an
ofﬁce with ambient noise of about 55 dB SPL except the
experiments which explore the impact of background noise.
The transmitting power of speaker is limited to 1 Watt.
Metrics. To evaluate the performance of the detection
system proposed in this paper, the following experiments are
conducted using 5 metrics. Accuracy: The rate that correctly
identifying legitimate and illegitimate voice commands, true
negative rate (TNR), true positive rate (TPR), precision, and
recall.
C. Overall Performance
1) Detection Accuracy: As we can see from Fig. 4, the
attacker could launch an attack at anywhere around the smart
speaker, to explore the detection performance from any spatial
location and given carrier frequencies (25, 30, 40 kHz), we
play the ﬁve audible voice commands and ﬁve inaudible voice
commands with ultrasonic transducer arrays and JBL GO at
positions controlled by ϕ, θ, and R. We ﬁrst rotate speakers
around the diameter of the top surface (x-axis), that is, ϕ is
set to 0 degree, θ changes from -120 to 120 degree with a
step of 30 degree. The distance R is set to 30 cm and 60 cm
respectively. Secondly, the sound source will be rotated around
the z-axis, θ is set to 0 degree, ϕ changes from 0 to 360 degree,
the step is 30 degree.
To show the overall performance of EarArray, we calcu-
late the TPR, FPR, precision, and recall using all the recorded
samples, and plot the ROC curves and Precision-Recall (R-
P) curves as shown in Fig. 13(a)(b), from which we can
observe that EarArray successfully detects inaudible voice
commands with high reliability. The area under ROC curve
(AUC) can be up to 100% when the window size is ﬁxed to
0.4 s, when the window size is 0.6 s, the AUC is also up to
96%. And the areas under P-R curves are above 99%.
2) Localization Accuracy: To investigate the accuracy of
localization for the inaudible voice commands, we choose
the audio samples recorded from microphones of different
directions, that is ϕ ranges from 0 to 360 degree with step
size of 30 degree, the attack distance is set to 60 cm. For
each direction, the experiment repeats three times, and we
calculate and average the accuracy of localization, the direction
I represent when ϕ ranges from 0 to 90 degree. The results
of localization are depicted in Fig. 13(c), from which we
can observe that the accuracy of localization is 100, 100,
97.89, 100%. In the process of experiments, we ﬁnd that the
frequency response of microphone M3 is lower than the others
which will inﬂuence the received signal strength.
D. Impact of Distances
With the increase of distance, the sound ﬁeld scattered from
the speaker will change accordingly, especially when the to
explore whether the variation of distance affects the detection
performance, the distance between sound source and smart
speaker is set to 30, 60, 100, 200, 300 cm. As the effective
attacking distance is hardware-dependent, when the distance
is 3 m, the SPL of received inaudible voice command is weak
which can’t achieve a successful attack, thus, the maximum
distance is set to 300 cm. The results are shown in Fig. 14
(a) conﬁrm that with increase of distance, the TPR and TNR
don’t have obvious change. On the whole, even the SNR is
getting worse as the increase of distance, the performance of
EarArray doesn’t distance effect.

differences in microphones.
The incident angle determines the position relationship
between sound source and ﬁve microphones, which directly
inﬂuence the SPL distribution at each microphone. And the
attacker can launch an attack in any concealed or most effective
position. To explore the impact of incident angle on the
performance of EarArray, we do the following experiments
at a distance of 60 cm with different angles θ, ϕ.
Impact of θ. To evaluate the inﬂuence of θ on EarArray,
ϕ is set to 0, and θ is changing from -120 to 120 degree (θ
is 90 degree when the sound source is paralleling to x-axis
positive direction), the step size is 30 degree. With increasing
of the absolute value of θ, the sound source will close to the
ground, thus, the maximum absolute value of θ is set to 120
degree. The results are shown in Fig. 14(b), as the value of θ
gradually increases from -120 to 120 degree, the values of TPR
and TNR are not obvious change and remain close to 100%,
which indicates the performance of EarArray doesn’t affect
by angle.
Impact of ϕ. In this experiment, we ﬁxed θ at 0 degree and
change ϕ from 0 to 330 degree (ϕ is 90 degree when the sound
source is paralleling to y-axis positive direction), the step
size is 30 degree. The experimental results plot in Fig. 14(c),
from the ﬁgure, we can observe that the performance of the
EarArray does not change signiﬁcantly with the changing
of ϕ, when ϕ is 120 and 210 degree, the values of TNR
are slightly lower than the average value. That is because
the frequency response of microphone (M3) is different from
the others which will inﬂuence the reality of measured sound
ﬁeld distribution. In future work, dynamic gain control (DGC)
strategy should be applied to eliminate the interference of
F.
Inﬂuence of Carrier Frequencies
Carrier frequency is a dominant factor that affects the
attack success rate, and it also shows great variance across
devices [14]. For EarArray, the carrier frequency is also an
important parameter that will directly inﬂuence the distribution
of the sound ﬁeld and then affects the detection performance.
To investigate the effect of the carrier frequency, we conduct
the following experiments. We modulate the ﬁve voice com-
mands on 25, 32, 40 kHz carries respectively, and launch the
attack at a distance of 60 cm. We repeated the experiment 3
times and ﬁnally calculate the detection results as shown in
Fig. 15(a). From which we can observe that the maximum
accuracy is 99.14% at the carrier frequency of 40 kHz, which
reﬂects the sound ﬁeld distribution of high-frequency sound is
more uneven, thus, it’s easier to detect.
G. Impact of Ambient Noise
Background noise will not only affect
the recognition
rate of the speech recognition system but also change the
distribution of the spatial sound ﬁeld. To evaluate the impact
of ambient noises, we simulate ﬁve scenarios by playing
accordingly audio with a given range of SPL in our ofﬁce,
note that, the SPL of noise should be measured near the victim
device. The SPL of street, restaurant, ofﬁce, car, and shopping
mall is 75–85, 65–75, 55–65, 60–70, 60–75 dB respectively.
The detection results are shown in Fig. 15(b), from which
we can ﬁnd that
the TPR will slightly decrease with the
increase of ambient noise, but the TNR does not affect by
noise. That is because the SPL of ambient noise is higher

than audible voice commands, and the ambient noise includes
some non-speech high-frequency components which lead to
an uneven sound ﬁeld and misclassiﬁcation. On the whole,
the experimental results show that EarArray is robust to
different noise sources.
H. Impact of Different Voice Commands
To examine the effectiveness of EarArray with regard
to voice commands, we select ﬁve types of voice commands
which are list in Tab. II. We then play the 500 voice samples
using JBL Go and collect the audible signal, to collect the
inaudible signal, we modulate the 500 voice samples on 40 kHz
carries, and launch the attack at a distance of 60 cm. Fig. 15(c)
shows the impact of voice commands on TPR and TNR. As we
can see that the TPR and TNR of various voice commands are
almost the same and range from 98.4% to 100%. The results
illustrated that different types of voice commands would not
have an obvious impact on EarArray.
I. Evasion Techniques
To show the effectiveness of EarArray when the adver-
sary knows of the defense method and tries to circumvent the
protection, we consider three evasion strategies: 1) the attacker
is hiding behind an obstacle; 2) the victim device is close to
walls; 3) multiple speaker injection.
1) Hiding Behind Obstacles: In this experiment, we choose
a cylinder as the obstacle whose size is the same as that of the
smart speaker, and the distance between the obstacle and the
smart speaker is ﬁxed to 40 cm while the distance between the
transducer array and obstacle is changing from 5 cm to 155
cm with a 30-cm step. Note that if the obstacle is much bigger
than the transducer array (9×15 cm), it will block the attack
signal when the transducer array is close to the obstacle. From
Fig. 16(a), we can see that only when the distance between the
obstacle and transducer array is 35 cm, the detection accuracy
is decreased to 97.7%, the accuracy of EarArray at other
distances can be up to 100%. Thus, the obstacle would not
reduce the effectiveness of EarArray.
2) Inﬂuence of Surrounding Walls: When the smart speaker
is close to walls, acoustic reﬂection from walls will inﬂuence
the distribution of the sound ﬁeld, which might be leveraged
by adversaries. To evaluate the effectiveness with regard to
surroundings, we conduct the following experiments, the smart
speaker placed equidistant from two walls that are at a right
angle to each other. The distance between the walls and the
smart speaker ranges from 0 cm to 60 cm, the distance between
the transducer array and the smart speaker is ﬁxed at 60
cm. The results are depicted in Fig. 16(b), from which we
can observe that the accuracy changes slightly with distances,
which remains within a certain range from 97.8% to 100%.
Thus, EarArray is resistant to the inﬂuence of surrounding
object and the defense effectively works.
3) Multiple Speaker Injection: To disrupt the uneven dis-
tribution of the sound ﬁeld and escape detection, the adversary
might use two transducer arrays around the smart speaker.
In this experiment, we use two same transducer arrays to
evaluate the effectiveness of EarArray. The two transducer
arrays (speaker 1 and speaker 2) face toward the smart speaker,
simultaneously play the same inaudible voice commands, and
the three devices are in the same line. The distance between
speaker 1 and smart speaker (d1) is set to 60 cm, the distance

between speaker 2 and smart speaker (d2) is changing from
20 cm to 100 cm, the step is 20 cm. Experimental results
as shown in Fig. 16(c) demonstrate that when the value of
d2 is equal to d1, the accuracy EarArray is 91.1% and
the TPR is 85.7%, this result means that the two speakers
could make the sound ﬁeld more uniform when the SPL
of reached signals from two speakers are the same, and
will, in a manner, reduce TPR of EarArray. To improve
the performance of detecting multi-speaker injection, a more
sophisticated structure of the 3-D microphone array should be
studied, for example, the diaphragm of microphone doesn’t
face toward the sound inlet, thus, the inaudible signal will
greatly attenuate before propagating into the diaphragm. We
leave this to future work.
J.
Inﬂunce of Windowsize and Overlap Size
To investigate the impact of various window sizes on
EarArray, we make the window size changes from 0.05 to
2.25 s, the overlap size to is set to tw/2, and calculate the
accuracy, TPR, TNR respectively. Fig. 17(a) depicts how the
window size inﬂuences the performance of EarArray. As
the window size increases, the accuracy/TPR/TNR gradually
increases, and when the window size is above 0.4 s, the values
are maintained above 99% and slightly ﬂuctuate.
Usually, a longer overlap size to brings more correlation
between adjacent voice samples, however, with given total
voice signal for training or testing, the processed data will
be repeated and decrease the detection efﬁciency. To ﬁnd
a balance between detection performance and efﬁciency, we
ﬁxed the window size to 1 s and change the overlap size
from 0.05 s to 0.7 s. Fig. 17(b) shows the performance of
detection under different overlap sizes. We can observe that
as the overlap size bigger than 0.17 s, the accuracy keeps at
a higher range from 98.9% to 100%. In general, to obtains a
good balance between efﬁciency and performance, the value
of to in the range from tw/4 to tw/2 is suitable.
K. Impact of Sound Pressure Level
To explore the impact of SPLs on EarArray, we lower
the SPL of inaudible voice commands to the minimum value
of 98.7 dB which still can be recognized by a smart device [5].
The SPLs were measured by a measurement microphone [7]
which is placed next to the smart speaker. Fig. 17(c) shows
the impact of the SPLs on the accuracy, TPR, and TNR.
Although a lower SPL always means a smaller signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) for given noise levels, the accuracy of EarArray
still can be up to 100% when the SPL is 98.7 dB. With the
increases of SPLs, the accuracy decreases to 96.5% and then
increases to 100%, which suggests that EarArray is effective
even with a lower pressure level of the inaudible signal.
L. Smartphone with Three Microphones
In this section, we use the smartphone prototype to eval-
uate the effectiveness of EarArray on smart devices whose
microphone array design is similar to actual smartphones. We
play audible and inaudible voice commands 90 cm away from
the prototype which was placed on a table, the ϕ ranges from
0 to 330 degree, the step is 30 degree. The experimental results
