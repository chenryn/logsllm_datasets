I apologise if I'm using this incorrectly, but I could not find anything
relevant in the issue list, and as far as I can work out, this really should
work.
If I pass an array with unicode objects (instead of 'string' objects) into
savetxt, it bombs out, trying to run the unicode object through the 'asbytes'
function.
It does not change things if the dtype of the array is 'U' instead of 'S'.
    >>> import numpy as np; np.savetxt('test.csv', np.array(['this wörks', u'this dös not']), fmt=['%s'])
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
