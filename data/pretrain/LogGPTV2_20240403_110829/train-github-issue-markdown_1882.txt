I see two different conventions being used for including optional arguments in
docstrings, one where the argument alone is wrapped in `[arg]`, and one where
the preceding comma is included `[, arg]`. I happen to find the second one a
bit visually confusing, but the first one looks like a vector is created so
it's not really optimal either. What are peoples thoughts about this? Should
base try to at least be consistent here? Below is an example where the two
styles are mixed up, sometimes even on the same line
    help?> round
      round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]) # comma included for the first argument but not the second?
      round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; digits=, base=10) # what's up with the value for digits?
      round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; sigdigits=, base=10)
      ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      round([T,] x, [r::RoundingMode])   # comma included for T but not for r
      round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; digits::Integer=0, base = 10) # comma not included for r
      round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; sigdigits::Integer, base = 10)
I guess it's not the biggest of problems, but the inconsistencies may be a bit
confusing, especially to newcomers who need to take in all the other language
syntax at the same time.
