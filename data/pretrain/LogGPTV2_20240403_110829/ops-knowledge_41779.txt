Certainly! Here's an optimized version of the Kusto Query Language (KQL) query to detect anomalies in OAuth applications reading mail via the Graph API, specifically for identifying potential Nobelium-related activities:

```kql
// Detect OAuth Apps reading mail via Graph API that did not read mail in the previous week
let detectionPeriod = 1d;
let baselinePeriod = 7d;

let appMailReadActivity = (timeframeStart: datetime, timeframeEnd: datetime) {
    CloudAppEvents
    | where Timestamp between (timeframeStart .. timeframeEnd)
    | where ActionType == "MailItemsAccessed"
    | where RawEventData has "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" // Performance check
    | extend RawData = parse_json(RawEventData)
    | extend AppId = tostring(RawData.AppId)
    | extend OAuthAppId = tostring(RawData.ClientAppId) // Extract OAuthAppId
    | summarize by OAuthAppId
};

appMailReadActivity(ago(detectionPeriod), now()) // Detection period
| join kind=leftanti (
    appMailReadActivity(ago(baselinePeriod + 1d), ago(baselinePeriod - 1d)) // Baseline period
) on OAuthAppId
```

### Explanation:
1. **Detection and Baseline Periods**:
   - `detectionPeriod` is set to 1 day.
   - `baselinePeriod` is set to 7 days.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The `appMailReadActivity` function takes two parameters: `timeframeStart` and `timeframeEnd`.
   - It filters `CloudAppEvents` for the specified time frame, looking for `MailItemsAccessed` actions.
   - It includes a performance check using the specific GUID.
   - It parses the `RawEventData` to extract `AppId` and `OAuthAppId`.
   - It summarizes the results by `OAuthAppId`.

3. **Join Operation**:
   - The query first runs the `appMailReadActivity` function for the detection period (last 1 day).
   - It then joins this result with the `appMailReadActivity` for the baseline period (previous 7 days) using a left anti-join.
   - This ensures that only OAuth apps that read mail in the detection period but not in the baseline period are returned.

This optimized query is more readable, maintainable, and clearly defines the detection and baseline periods.
