React version: ^16.13.1
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. npx create-react-app my-app
  2. cd my-app/
  3. npm start
## The current behavior
app doesn't start, instead shows error:
    Failed to compile
    ./src/index.css (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-3-1!./node_modules/postcss-loader/src??postcss!./src/index.css)
    Error: No valid exports main found for '/private/tmp/my-app/node_modules/colorette'
    This error occurred during the build time and cannot be dismissed.
## The expected behavior
`npx create-react-app my-app` should provide an app that runs.
