Question: A network administrator is configuring a mobile application's backend server interface to communicate with the AP. The administrator suggests using the IP address '10.0.0.1'. What could be a valid counterargument against using this IP address?
"A": "The IP address '10.0.0.1' is commonly used as a default gateway, potentially resulting in network routing issues if used for the server.",
"B": "Assigning '10.0.0.1' to the server will enhance network security as it is a non-routable address in public networks.",
"C": "Using '10.0.0.1' will automatically configure the server as a DHCP server, providing dynamic IP assignment to devices.",
"D": "The choice of '10.0.0.1' as an IP address will increase network performance due to its placement at the start of the IP range."
Answer: A
