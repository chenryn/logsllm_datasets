Hi,
I'm trying to load a module in my application router in 2 ways:
  1. { path: 'lazy', loadChildren:'src/lazy/lazy.module#LazyModule' }
  2. { path: 'lazy', loadChildren: ()=> LazyModule }
In both ways the constructor of LazyModule is being invoked twice.  
Is there any way to avoid it?
Regards,  
Lior
