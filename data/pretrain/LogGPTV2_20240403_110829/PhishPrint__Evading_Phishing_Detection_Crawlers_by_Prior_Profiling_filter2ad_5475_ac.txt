Table 1: Details of 70-day proﬁling study including CVD scores for the six cloaking vectors
The scores are color-coded: red for 66.
JSE-A: JS Execution Anomaly; RB-A: Real Browser Anomaly; CA-A: Crawler Artifacts Anomaly;
#IPs: Crawler IP Addresses; #CCs: Country Codes; IP-B: IP Blocklist; AS-B: AS Blocklist;
#s: Font/Canvas/WebGL ﬁngerprint tuples; #F: Font ﬁngerprints; #C: Canvas ﬁngerprints;
#W: WebGL ﬁngerprints; FCW-B:  Fingerprint Blocklist;
associated with the IP addresses. APWG is an interesting
example, in that even though they employ 2726 IP addresses,
they are all associated with only 8 countries which makes
a country-based cloaking vector feasible for targeting victims
outside those 8 countries. The CVD scores demonstrate a
very polarized situation with roughly half the crawlers having
very good scores >80 and half having very bad scores  Fingerprint Blocklist. Column 10 shows
the the number of distinct  ﬁngerprints and the
individual Font, Canvas and WebGL ﬁngerprints collected
from the crawlers. It also shows the  Fingerprint
Blocklist CVD scores considering the ﬁngerprint tuple.
Despite scanning 16,730 distinct domains and initiating
348,516 HTTP sessions over 70 days, we see that the crawlers
collectively only had 204 distinct  ﬁngerprints
including 162 Canvas and 182 Font ﬁngerprints. These
numbers can be put into perspective by seeing that a prior
study [22] has collected as many as 78K distinct Canvas FPs
and 17K distinct Font FPs over a 6-month period with the
help of a few regional websites4. Further, we can also notice
these crawlers used as many as 15,394 distinct IP addresses
in total. This shows that while many vendors are actively
trying to change their network infrastructure ﬁngerprints,
little is being done to vary the advanced browser ﬁngerprints.
Inspecting the individual rows, we can see that even ven-
dors that invested a lot into their network infrastructure such
as GSB and APWG only have a handful of distinct s
(2 and 6). Note that 7 crawlers have a 0 score in combating
the Real Browser Anomaly cloaking vector. This means their
browsers are not even capable of running the ﬁngerprinting
code and hence we did not collect any s from them.
Some crawlers such as PhishTank, Bitdefender and the VT
ecosystem fare slightly better with 51, 46 and 101 distinct
4This study did not include AmIUnique’s current WebGL FP implemen-
tation. Further, our experiments showed they are the least speciﬁc of the 3
ﬁngerprints §3.2.1. Hence, we avoid discussing WebGL ﬁngerprints here.
However, we do use these as part of the  tuple as already described.

Figure 2: Growth of distinct IP addresses and ﬁngerprints in PhishPrint database for different crawlers
values of s. However, these still not seem to be sufﬁ-
cient as demonstrated by their ﬁngerprint CVD scores. Bitde-
fender’s score although the highest among all crawlers is still
only 9.3. This means that more than 90% of the token URLs
would have evaded detection from Bitdefender using the
s as a simple blocklist. It is also interesting to see the
growth rate graphs of distinct Font, Canvas ﬁngerprints col-
lected by PhishPrint. While the IP addresses had an almost lin-
ear growth for many crawlers (such as GSB and APWG), the
Font and Canvas ﬁngerprint growth rates present a completely
opposite picture. As GSB has only 2 such ﬁngerprints that
were used from day 1, the graph is just a ﬂat line. For APWG,
PhishTank and Bitdefender, the growth rate is very low in the
last 30 days. This indicates the high likelihood of a successful
blocklist cloaking vector which we will demonstrate later §4.
SmartScreen has only 17 s for its 822 URLs. The
growth rate for these is in a step-wise fashion with long ﬂat
lines indicating again the utility of a blocklist cloaking vector.
Further, this best score of 9.3 remains in very stark contrast
with best scores for the other ﬁve cloaking vectors as shown
in the ﬁnal row of the table. This shows that while the other
cloaking vectors are being well handled by at least some
crawlers, advanced ﬁngerprints such as s present
a grave cloaking weakness that seems to be affecting all the
entities in the crawler ecosystem.
3.2.1 Speciﬁcity of Advanced Fingerprints
As we are proposing to use s as a blocklist for
evasion, their speciﬁcity needs to be established as already
discussed. We accomplished this by collecting a set of
s from crawlers and measuring how common they
are among internet users. For this, we re-deployed PhishPrint
on 3 days spread evenly over September 2020. We collected
all s from 5 crawlers (listed in Fig. 3)5 by sending
12 token URLs each day to each of the 5 crawlers. It is to
be noted that 35 of these 180 URLs (including 34 PhishTank
URLs) were shared with VirusTotal immediately, thereby
soliciting crawls from many of the 80 VT crawlers similar to
the longitudinal study. At the end of each day, we waited for a
5We chose these 5 crawlers based on ﬁngerprint diversity and popularity.
We limited to only these as our prior agreement with AmIUnique project
developers (our data source) limited us to only 100 ﬁngerprint look-ups.
We will show in §4.2 that these crawlers are mainly responsible for most
ﬁngerprint collisions with users.

Table 2: Speciﬁcity of Crawler Fingerprints
Figure 3: CDF plots showing the prevalence (in %) of crawler
ﬁngerprints among 467K web users. Solid markers indicate
ﬁngerprints that were also found in the 10-week study7
24 hour period and then sent the collected ﬁngerprints to AmI-
Unique project’s API [2]. This allowed us to directly measure
the percentage of AmIUnique visitors who have the same
Font, Canvas or WebGL ﬁngerprints. Each time we made a
query, the API would look up the data of visitors in the past 90
days6. As our 3 querying days are spread across a one-month
period, the datasets of visitors against which our ﬁngerprints
were compared on each day is different. Among the 3
