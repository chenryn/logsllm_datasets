User: I am running iPython v0.13 on windows 7 64-bit. (qtconsole --pylab=inline)
When I type %cd 'C:/Users/My Name/Downloads' it takes me to the desired location.
When I tab auto-complete between directories the auto-complete fails if directories have a space in their names (as in the example).
Is there a reason for this and a solution to overcome it (besides migrating to Linux or using underscores as filename/directory name separators.
Thanks.
Assistant: Just now I have a try with ipython on my mac, auto-complete works well when dealing with space-contained directory. The ipython version I used is 0.13.1. Perhaps simple upgrade your ipython can solve.
