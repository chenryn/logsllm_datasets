  * Operating System / Platform => Windows and Linux x64
  * Compiler => gcc and python bindings
##### Detailed description
There is a large difference in calculations after the first batch
normalization layer when I use a convolutional model with the opencv dnn
module. The model is made with Keras/Tensorflow 1.14. The graph is frozen and
then saved in binary .pb format.
##### Steps to reproduce
Here is the model up to the batch norm layer in text format

Here is a test image ( grayscale, should be rescaled in range 0..1, before
passing as input)
