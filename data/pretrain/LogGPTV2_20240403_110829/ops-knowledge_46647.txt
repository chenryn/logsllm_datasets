User: How to use GitLab for code warehouse management and continuous integration deployment?
Assistant: 1. Create a project: Create a new project in GitLab, select the code warehouse type (Git, SVN, etc.), and fill in the project name, description and other information. 2. Configure the warehouse: add the remote warehouse address, set the branch name and permissions, etc. 3. Key management: Generate SSH keys and add the public key to GitLab to enable local code access to the warehouse. 4. Configure continuous integration and deployment: In the project settings, configure continuous integration and continuous deployment, set the execution of build commands, test commands, etc. 5. Install Runner: Add the build tool Runner to the project to facilitate continuous integration and continuous deployment in GitLab. 6. Trigger build: After the code is submitted to the warehouse, continuous integration and continuous deployment can be performed by triggering the build command. Continuous integration and deployment can be automatically triggered after code submission through Webhook. Through the above steps, you can perform code warehouse management and continuous integration deployment in GitLab.
