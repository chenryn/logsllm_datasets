##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
Ansible setup module.
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
ansible 2.2.2.0  
config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg  
configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
N/A
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Control: CentOS 7.3  
Target: CentOS 7.3
##### SUMMARY
When gathering facts for a host with a high open file limit setting, fact
gathering can take a long time. This is exacerbated on systems with many
network interfaces. On a system with an open file limit of 1048576 and ~50
network interfaces (mostly virtual), fact gathering takes in excess of 20
seconds.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Set the open file limit to a high value:
    - hosts: all
      become: yes
      tasks:
      - name: increase file descriptor limit
        copy:
          dest: /etc/security/limits.d/99-nofile.conf
          content: |
            root soft nofile 1048576
            root hard nofile 1048576
Gather facts:
    - hosts: all
      become: yes
      gather_facts: yes
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Facts are gathered in a reasonable time.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Facts took a long time to be gathered.
