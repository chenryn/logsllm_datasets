We propose to add a `pod/dockercmd` subresource, so that user can run some
userful docker command on his container, such as commit the image of his
container by running `docker commit`.
By now, k8s just support the `docker logs` and `docker attach`command by the
`pod/log` and `pod/attach` subresource. Our idea is to add a general
`pod/dockercmd` subresource to support more useful docker commands(and disable
some dangerous commands such as `docker stop`), the existing `pod/log` and
`pod/attache` subresource can be deprecated after the `pod/dockercmd`
subresource is supported.
Such a way is much more extensible: if we want support another docker command
in the future, just add it to the "whitelist", instead of adding a new
subresource and duplicating a lot of code.
Any comment is welcomed.
