titleblackhat:us-19 MITRE ATT&CK: The Play at Home Edition
You've seen the tactics and techniques. You've read the descriptions. However, something is missing…how do you take the theory of MITRE ATT&CK™ and actually DO something with it? At first glance, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the ATT&CK framework. Where do you start? Who should use it? What can you really do with a framework like ATT&CK? Combining the knowledge of an ATT&CK team member with the experience of a security practitioner who has helped implement it, Katie and Ryan will teach you how to take ATT&CK from a cool-sounding idea to a powerful force for creating a threat-informed defense in your company. They will walk the audience through the story of how ATT&CK helped a fictional organization solve real-world-inspired problems that defenders struggle with every day. The presentation will discuss how different teams like threat intelligence analysts, threat hunters, SOC analysts, red teamers, and even executives can use ATT&CK to improve how they track threats and protect against them. Regardless of their role, attendees will learn how they can hit the ground running with ATT&CK on the first day they return home.
