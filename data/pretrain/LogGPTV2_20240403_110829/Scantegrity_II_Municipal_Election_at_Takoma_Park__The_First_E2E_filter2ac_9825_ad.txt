beep 1 time. During shutdown, the scanner would beep
another 3 times. If there were any failure modes the scan-
ner would beep continuously or not beep at all.
Election judges set up the check-in tables, pollbooks,
and voting booths. The election started on time.
Voting The election proceeded quite smoothly, with
very few (small) glitches. An SVST member was able
to assist polling ofﬁcials in ﬁxing a problem with their
poll books (not provided by Scantegrity). Voters had
some initial problems with the use of the scanner and
the privacy sleeve, some seeking assistance from elec-
tion judges who also had difﬁculty. After an explanation
to the election judges by the Chair of the Board of Elec-
tions, the use of the scanner was considerably smoother.
With a few ballots, the privacy sleeve was not letting
go of the ballots; one ballot was mangled considerably
but scanned ﬁne. Seventeen scanned ballots had lines on
them that caused the scanner to be unable to read votes,
and one ballot had alignment marks manipulated such
that it was also unreadable.
Images of all unreadable
scans are saved, so we were able to manually enter in
these votes. Of the seventeen ballots, many ballots had a
line in the same location, which is consistent with there
being a foreign substance on a ballot put into the scan-
ner. These problems did not affect our ability to count
the votes.
During the day, Ms. Coney chose about ﬁfty ballots at
random, uniformly distributed across wards, and exposed
the conﬁrmation codes for all options for the ballots. A
copy of each ballot was made for her to take with her;
the copies were signed by the Chair of the BoE. Neither
Ms. Coney nor SVST members had any interaction with
voters.
Towards the end of the day, after the local NPR sta-
tion carried clips from an interview with the Chair of the
Board of Elections and a voter, the polling station saw a
large increase in the number of voters, with the line tak-
ing up much of the ﬂoor outside the polling room. The
SVST prepared to print more ballots, but this was not re-
quired. The number of printed ballots ended up being
almost twice the number of voted ballots.
Absentee and early voted ballots were scanned in af-
ter the closing of polls. Afterward, the scanners were
shut down. The chief judge opened each lock box, set
all sticks to read only, removed 2 USB sticks (leaving
the third with the scanning netbook), and locked the lock
box. Our team was given 1 stick for the ERM system.
The other was kept by the city.
In Meeting 3a, trustees used Scantegrity code to gen-
erate results without provisional ballots at about 10 pm.
The Chair of the Board of Election announced the results
to those present at the polling place at the time (including
candidates, their representatives, voters, etc.); this was
also televised live by the local TV station. Conﬁrma-
tion codes and the election day tally were posted on the
Scantegrity website.
6.3 After the Election
On the next day, around 2 pm, results including veriﬁed
provisional ballots were published. Takoma Park rep-
resentatives had announced a tally without provisional
ballots the night before, and followed with the tally that
included veriﬁed provisionals in accordance with stan-
dard Takoma Park procedures. The ﬁnal Meeting 3 re-
sults were published on November 4th just before mid-
night.
The number of registered voters were 10,934 and 1728
votes were cast (15.8%). The city-certiﬁed ﬁnal tally for
each contest is provided in Table 1. In each race, a ma-
jority was won after tallying after the voter’s ﬁrst choice.
Hand Count and Certiﬁcation Following a hand
count performed by representatives from both the SVST
and Takoma Park, the Chair of the Board of Elections
certiﬁed the results of the hand count to the City Council
at 7 pm on November 5. The hand count and the Scant-
egrity count differed because ofﬁcials were able to better
determine voter intent during the hand count. For exam-
ple, in the mayoral race, the scanner count determined
that 646 votes were cast for candidate Schlegel, 972 for
Williams, 15 for various write-in candidates, and 90 were
not cast. The certiﬁed hand count totals were 664 votes
for Schlegel, 1000 for Williams and 17 for write-in can-
didates. Thus 48 of a total of 1681 votes in this race
would not have been counted by a scanner count alone.
The discrepancy was caused by voters marking ballots
outside of the designated marking areas. Such marks,
while not read by the scanner by deﬁnition, are consid-
ered valid votes by Takoma Park law. Similarly, 8 of a
total of 447 votes for Ward 1 council member, 8 of 251
for Ward 2, 16 of 431 for Ward 3, 10 of 210 for Ward 4,
2 of 81 for Ward 5 and 11 of 199 for Ward 6 were added
to scanner vote totals after hand counting.
Post-Election Audit During Meeting 4, held on
November 6 at 6 p.m., trustees used Scantegrity-written
code to reveal all codes on voted ballots, and to reveal ev-
erything for all the ballots that were not spoiled or voted

upon. Trustees also responded to pseudo-random chal-
lenges generated by stock market results at closing on
November 6. Scantegrity published all data on Novem-
ber 7th around 9am. While the SVST could have chosen
to use closing data on an earlier date, such as November
4 or November 5, which could have been more stable,
the team chose to stick to its earlier-announced plan (of
using the freshest stock market data) for the sake of con-
sistency.
On November 9, 2009, Dr. Adida and Dr. Zag´orski
independently conﬁrmed that Scantegrity correctly re-
sponded to all digital challenges.
In particular, they
conﬁrmed that the tally computation audit data was cor-
rect. Both made available independently-written code on
their websites that voters and others could use to check
the tally computation commitments. The Chair of the
BoE mentions that several voters have shown an interest
in running the code made available by Drs. Adida and
Zag´orski, and that she expects that Takoma Park voters
will use the code to perform some audits themselves in
the next few months.
Conﬁrmation Codes and Complaints The period for
complaints regarding the election (including complaints
about missing conﬁrmation codes) expired at 6 pm on
November 6.
The Scantegrity website recorded 81
unique ballot ID veriﬁcations, of which about 66 (almost
4% of the total votes) were performed before the dead-
line. The SVST was also told by a BoE member that
at least a few voters checked codes on auditor websites.
Both Dr. Adida and Dr. Zag´orski made the conﬁrmation
codes available on their websites after the election.
The number of voters who checked their ballots on-
line before the Takoma Park complaint deadline (66),
while not large, was sufﬁcient to have detected (with
high probability) any errors or fraud large enough to have
changed the election outcome.
(Detailed calculations
omitted here; these calculations are not so simple, due
to the use of IRV.)
Scantegrity received a single complaint by a voter who
had trouble deciphering a digit in the code and noted it
as “0,” while the Scantegrity website presented it as “8.”
The voter requested that codes be printed more clearly in
the future. He also stated that if he were not a trusting
individual, he would believe that he had proof that his
vote was altered.
All codes for all voted ballots were revealed after
the dispute resolution period, and all commitments ver-
iﬁed by two independent auditors, Dr. Adida and Dr.
Zag´orski. Hence, the probability that the code was in er-
ror is very small, albeit non-zero. Scantegrity does not
believe the code was in error, and there were no other
complaints regarding conﬁrmation numbers.
Print Audits Dr. Zag´orski provided an interface al-
Coney to check the commitments
lowing Ms.
opened by Scantegrity in Meeting 4 against
the
candidate/conﬁrmation-code correspondence on the bal-
lots she audited. In her report [12], she conﬁrmed that
the correspondence between conﬁrmation numbers and
candidates on all the printed ballots audited by her was
correctly provided by the interface.
Followup The Board of Elections and an SVST rep-
resentative met to discuss the election and opportunities
for improvement several weeks after the election. Both
sides were largely satisﬁed with the election. Conversa-
tions have begun regarding the use of Scantegrity in the
next municipal election at Takoma Park, to be held in
November 2011. No decisions have been taken.
7 Surveys and Observations of Voter Expe-
riences
To understand the experiences of voters and poll workers,
we timed some of the voters as they voted, asked voters
and poll workers to ﬁll out two questionnaires, and in-
formally solicited comments from voters as they left the
precinct building. Approved by the Board of Elections
and UMBC’s Institutional Review Board, our procedures
respected the constraint of not interfering with the elec-
12
tion process. This section summarizes the results of our
observations and surveys.
Timing Data Sitting unobtrusively as ofﬁcial ob-
servers in a designated area of the polling room for part
of the day, two helpers (not members of the Scantegrity
team) timed 93 voters as they carried out the voting pro-
cess. Using stopwatches, they measured the number of
seconds that transpired from the time the voter received
a ballot to the time the voter began walking away from
the scanner.
to 10mins.
Voting times ranged from 55 secs.
(the
second longest time was 385 secs.), with a mean of 167
secs. and a median of 150 secs. On average, voters who
appeared older took longer than voters who appeared
younger. Most of the time was spent marking the bal-
lot. The average time to vote was signiﬁcantly faster
than during the April 2009 mock election, when voters
took approximately 8 mins. on average due primarily to
scanning delays [26].
The observers noted that many voters did not fully use
the privacy sleeve as intended, removing the ballot before
scanning rather than inserting the privacy sleeve with the
ballot into the scanning slot. Two of the 93 observed
voters initially inserted the privacy sleeve upside-down,
causing the ballot not to be fed into the scanner (even
though the scanner could read the ballot in any orienta-
tion). A few ran into difﬁculties trying to insert the sleeve
with one hand while holding something else in the other
hand.
Election Day Comments From Voters As voters left
the precinct building, members of the Scantegrity team
conducting the written surveys, and a helper (a usability
expert who is not a member of the Scantegrity team) so-
licited comments from voters with questions like, “What
did you think of the new voting system?” The helper so-
licited comments 1:30-3:00pm and 7-8pm. A common
response was, “It was easy.”
Quite a few voters did not understand that they could
verify their votes on-line and that, to do so, they had
to write down the codenumbers revealed by their bal-
lot choices. Some explained that they intentionally did
not read any instructions because they “knew how to
vote.” Others failed to notice or understand instructions
on posters along the waiting line, in the voting booth, on
the ballot, and in the Takoma Park Newsletter.
In response, later in the day, we announced to voters
as they entered the building that there is a new system;
to verify your vote, write down the codenumbers. These
verbal announcements seemed to have some positive ef-
fect, and there were fewer voter comments expressing
lack of awareness of the veriﬁcation option after we be-
gan the announcements. Nevertheless, some voters still
were unaware of the veriﬁcation option. It was a hum-
bling experience to see ﬁrst-hand how difﬁcult it can be
to get across the most basic points effectively, especially
the ﬁrst time a new system is used.
Some of the voters complained about the double-
ended pen, not knowing which end to use, or having trou-
ble writing in candidates with the chisel-point (the nar-
row point was intended for write-ins). A small number
of voters had difﬁculty seeing the codenumbers, perhaps
largely because repeatedly pressing too hard could erode
the paper. A few voters expressed concern about the dif-
ﬁculty of writing down the codenumbers, had the ballot
been much longer or had there been a large number of
competing candidates.
Many voters expressed a strong conﬁdence in the in-
tegrity of elections, while a small minority expressed
sharp distrust in previous electronic election technology.
These feelings seemed to be based more on a general
subjective belief rather than on detailed knowledge of
election procedures and technology. Similarly, those ex-
pressing strong conﬁdence in Scantegrity seemed to like
the concept of veriﬁcation but did not understand in de-
tail why Scantegrity provides high outcome assurance.
Survey of Voter Experiences As voters were leaving
the precinct, we invited them to ﬁll out two one-sided
survey forms: a ﬁeld-study questionnaire, and a demo-
graphics questionnaire. The ﬁeld study asked voters
about the voting system they just used, with most an-
swers expressed on a seven-point Likert scale. The last
question invited voters to make any additional sugges-
tions or comments. Each pair of forms had matching
serial numbers to permit correlation of the ﬁeld study
responses with demographics. 271 voters ﬁlled out the
forms.
Fifty-one voters wrote comments on the question-
naires, often pointing out confusion about various as-
pects of the process but with no consistent theme. (1)
