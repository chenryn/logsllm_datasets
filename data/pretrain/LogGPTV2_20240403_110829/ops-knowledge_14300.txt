User: This has been driving me crazy for the past 2 days.
I installed virtualenv on my Macbook using pip install virtualenv.
But when I try to create a new virtualenv using virtualenv venv, I get the error saying "virtualenv : command not found".
I used pip show virtualenv and the location of the installation is "Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages" but I can't figure out where the executable is. I tried dozens other similar looking posts but those solutions do not work for me.
Any ideas what might be going wrong here?

First check python is in the path.
python --version
Second check pip is installed.
pip --version
If it is not installed.
brew install pip
Third install virtualenv
sudo -H pip install virtualenv
