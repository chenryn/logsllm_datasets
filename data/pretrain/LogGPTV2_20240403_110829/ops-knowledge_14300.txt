I understand that you've been experiencing some frustration with setting up `virtualenv` on your MacBook. Let's go through the steps to diagnose and resolve the issue.

### Issue Description
- You installed `virtualenv` using `pip install virtualenv`.
- When you try to create a new virtual environment with `virtualenv venv`, you get the error: "command not found".
- The installation location is `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, but you can't find the executable.

### Steps to Diagnose and Resolve

1. **Check Python Installation:**
   First, ensure that Python is correctly installed and in your system's PATH.
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
   If you are using Python 3, use:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Check PIP Installation:**
   Verify that `pip` is installed and accessible from your command line.
   ```sh
   pip --version
   ```
   If `pip` is not installed, you can install it using Homebrew:
   ```sh
   brew install python
   ```

3. **Reinstall Virtualenv:**
   Ensure that `virtualenv` is installed for the correct Python version. If you are using Python 3, use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
   ```sh
   sudo -H pip install virtualenv
   ```
   For Python 3:
   ```sh
   sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv
   ```

4. **Verify Virtualenv Installation:**
   Check if `virtualenv` is installed and its location.
   ```sh
   pip show virtualenv
   ```
   For Python 3:
   ```sh
   pip3 show virtualenv
   ```

5. **Add Virtualenv to PATH:**
   If `virtualenv` is installed but not in your PATH, you may need to add it. Add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`):
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
   ```
   Then, reload your shell configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc  # or .bashrc, .bash_profile
   ```

6. **Test Virtualenv:**
   Try creating a new virtual environment again:
   ```sh
   virtualenv venv
   ```

### Additional Tips
- Ensure that you are using the correct version of Python and `pip` (i.e., `python3` and `pip3` if you are working with Python 3).
- Consider using `venv` module, which is included in the standard library for Python 3.3 and later:
  ```sh
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your setup, including the output of the commands mentioned above. This will help in further diagnosing the problem.
