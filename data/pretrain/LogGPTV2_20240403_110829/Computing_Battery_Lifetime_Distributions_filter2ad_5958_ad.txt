case (C = 4500As, c = 1), the battery lifetime is in general
shorter, because there is no bound-charge to be transferred
to the available-charge well.

We now evaluate and compare the battery lifetime distri-
butions for the simple and the burst model.
Figure 10 shows the lifetime distribution for the simple
model (see Figure 4) for three different battery settings. The
left set of curves is calculated for a capacity C = 500mAh
and c = 1, that is, all capacity sits in the available-charge
well. The rightmost curve is for C = 800mAh and c = 1.
It is computed by a uniformisation-based algorithm [25]
which is applicable for this special case and the small num-
ber of states. The middle set of curves corresponds to
the actual KiBaMRM with C = 800mAh, c = 1 and
k = 4.5 · 10−5/s= 1.96 · 10−2/h.

Figure 10. Battery lifetime distribution for the
simple model
For the simple model, it is possible to compute good
approximations using the Markovian approximation algo-
rithm. For the leftmost set of curves, only the available-
charge well is discretised while for the middle set of curves
both wells have to be discretised. This results in a better ap-
proximation for the left curves in comparison to the middle
curves.
From Figure 10 one can see that if only 62.5% of the
capacity becomes available at all (leftmost curves) the bat-
tery is most certainly empty (with probability > 99%) after
about 17 hours. If the rest of the charge is initially in the
bound charge well, the battery gets surely empty after about
23 hours, if all capcity is readily available (rightmost curve),
after about 25 hours. Hence, for this workload model it is
in general not possible to make use of the total capacity of
800mAh, if it is distributed between the bound-charge well
and the available-charge well. However, a large fraction of
the total capacity becomes available, which is shown by the
fact that the middle curves are closer to the right curve than
to the left set of curves.
In Figure 11 we ﬁnally compare the battery lifetime dis-
tribution of the simple and the burst model. The burst model
condenses the send activity and consequently spends more
time in sleep mode. This lets the battery last longer, that
is, its lifetime distribution curve lies right from the one for
the simple model. For example, after 20 hours the battery
is empty with a probability of about 95% when using the
simple model while it is empty with probability only about
89% in case of the burst model.

7 Conclusion
The aim of this paper has been twofold. First of all we
have discussed the increasing importance of the incorpo-
ration of battery aspects into system models.
In particu-
lar, we stressed the need for considering the nonlinear as-
pects of the battery models. Using the analytical KiBaM
as a starting point, we developed the KiBaMRM, a reward-
inhomogeneous Markov reward model for batteries. With
this model we can assess the battery lifetime distribution for
a stochastic workload model. We would like to mention that
the KiBaM does not cover all aspects of battery behaviour
(see Section 2). However, the class of time- and reward-
inhomogeneous MRMs is ﬂexible enough to describe more
realistic battery models.
For the actual computation of the battery lifetime dis-
tribution we provided an efﬁcient approximation algorithm
where the accumulated rewards are discretised. The compu-
tation then boils down to the transient solution of a CTMC.
With an implementation of this algorithm we evaluated the
lifetime of some small workload models, thereby also com-
paring to simulation results. Trying to approximate the al-
most deterministic lifetime for the on/off model resulted in
a poor accuracy. In contrast, for the simple and burst mode
of a wireless device, the algorithm gave good results. Using
the computed lifetime distributions we could show that in
general the battery lasts longer for the burst model than for
the simple model.
Future work will include the exploration of more realistic
MRMs for batteries and the evaluation of real world power-
aware devices.
