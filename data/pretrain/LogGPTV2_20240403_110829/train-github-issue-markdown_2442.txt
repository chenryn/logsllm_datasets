 **Update** : This issue explained in my comment seems to have been fixed in
v7.11.0 (see my update comment), however, another user has described a similar
error in v7.20.3, so I'm unsure whether I should close this issue or leave it
open.
**Using a git URL in the format`github:geotiffjs/geotiff.js#commit-hash` on
NPM v7 fails with sha-512 integrity errors. However, using a branch-name/tag
pointing to the same commit works fine.**
I can't seem to find another Git repo where this is failing (except for forks
of geotiff.js), so I think the issue might either with Github repos with
periods in their name and/or with `package.json` `prepare` scripts.
This might be related to #2919 which has a similar title, but their logs and
behaviour are different.  
I'm fairly certain this is an issue with the CDN, since it doesn't happen in
Node v6, and if I use a `get+ssh` URL on a new VM, the code fails before I get
a pop-up with a `The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.3)' can't be
established.`
### Current Behavior:
For the geotiff/geotiff.js repo, using a `git+https://...#commit-hash` URL
fails with a `EINTEGRITY` error, due to the sha512 error, e.g.
    ubuntu@gittest:~/geotiff.js$ npm pack "git+https://github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js.git#c01b2dcf00d5a324cd27c38709cb6ca97adf01e2"

The same error occurs if you try to do `npm install` on the URL, or if you use
a `git+ssh` url, or a short `github:` url:
`github:geotiffjs/geotiff.js#c01b2dcf00d5a324cd27c38709cb6ca97adf01e2`
### Expected Behavior:
Using NPM v6.14.11, the exact same command works fine.
    # ON NPM v6
    ubuntu@gittest:~/geotiff.js$ npm pack "git+https://github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js.git#c01b2dcf00d5a324cd27c38709cb6ca97adf01e2"
    npm notice 
    npm notice ðŸ“¦  geotiff@1.0.0
    npm notice === Tarball Contents === 
    npm notice 1.1kB   LICENSE
    # ...etc
Additionally, even on NPM v7.7.5, using a branch/tag name works fine: e.g.`npm
pack "github:github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js.git#v1.0.0"` works on NPMv7, even
though tag `v1.0.0` points to the same commit.
### Steps To Reproduce:
On NPM v7.7.5, run the following command:
`npm pack
"git+https://github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js.git#c01b2dcf00d5a324cd27c38709cb6ca97adf01e2"`
You can also try spinning up an Ubuntu VM using `minipool`:
  * `multipass launch --name npm-git-test && multipass shell npm-git-test`
  * install NVM then restart shell `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash`
  * Try working cmd on NPM v6.14.11: `npm pack github:geotiffjs/geotiff.js#c01b2dcf00d5a324cd27c38709cb6ca97adf01e2`
  * Update to NPM v7.7.5 and see the same command fail: `npm install -g npm && npm pack github:geotiffjs/geotiff.js#c01b2dcf00d5a324cd27c38709cb6ca97adf01e2`
### Environment:
I've tested this on a VM running:
  * OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
  * Node: v14.16.0
  * npm: 7.7.5
and a desktop running:
  * OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
  * Node: v12.19.1
  * npm: 7.7.5
