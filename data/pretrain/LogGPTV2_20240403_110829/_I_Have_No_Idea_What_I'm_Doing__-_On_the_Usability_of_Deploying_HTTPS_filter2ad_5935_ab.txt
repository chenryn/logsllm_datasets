## 3.3 Data Analysis
For a qualitative analysis of the observation protocols, we performed a series of iterative coding, a method commonly used in usable security research to develop models and theories from qualitative data [27, 34, 39]. Our approach involved several steps:

1. **Open Coding**: Two researchers independently traversed all data segments point-by-point and assigned descriptive codes. This process was conducted separately to minimize biased interpretation.
2. **Code Evaluation and Finalization**: We evaluated the initial codes and agreed on a final set, which was then used to code the protocols. The inter-rater agreement between the two coders was good (Cohen’s κ = 0.78).
3. **Axial Coding**: On the resulting coded data, we performed axial coding to identify explanations and relationships among the codes and topics, uncovering structures in the data.
4. **Selective Coding**: Finally, we performed selective coding to integrate the results and derive a theory from the data.

To structure the data from the open-ended questions collected through the questionnaire, we used an iterative coding process. We initially went through the collected data to produce an initial set of codes, revised them, and discussed recurring themes, patterns, and interconnections. After agreeing on a final set of codes, we coded the entire dataset. This analysis provided insights into usability challenges in the deployment process, which are presented in Section 4, grouped by themes.

To evaluate the (mostly) quantitative data acquired via the bash/browser history and Apache log files, we applied metrics and measures to assess the quality of the resulting configuration.

## 4 Results
In this section, we present the results from our lab study based on data from the think-aloud protocol, collected log files, and self-reported data from the exit questionnaire.

### 4.1 Security Evaluation
We based our evaluation criteria on Qualy’s SSL Test, which is a useful benchmark for assessing the quality of a TLS configuration according to state-of-the-art recommendations from various RFCs [37, 38] and with respect to recently discovered vulnerabilities and attacks. Since web services have different requirements, such as backward compatibility for outdated browsers, there is no universally applicable recommendation to achieve the highest grade. However, this rating is widely accepted and applicable to generic web services like those in our study.

It is important to note that this benchmark reflects the best-case scenario at the time of writing and may change if new vulnerabilities are discovered.

The rating of the evaluation criteria is expressed with a grade from A to F, composed of three independent values:
1. Protocol Support (30%)
2. Key Exchange (30%)
3. Cipher Strength (40%)

Some properties, such as support for the RC4 cipher, can cap the overall grade, as shown in Table 3. Table 2 summarizes the results of a security evaluation based on the final configuration per participant, with additional information in Table 3. The full set of evaluation criteria based on the metrics used in Qualy’s SSL Test is listed in Appendix A.

- Only four participants managed to deploy an A-grade TLS configuration, with P24 receiving the best overall score.
- B was the most commonly awarded grade (15 out of 28).
- Four participants did not manage to deploy a valid TLS configuration in the given time (P7, P18, P23, P26).
- Two participants (P10 and P19) encrypted their private keys with passphrases "abc123" and "pass." One passphrase was not shared but was easy to brute-force.
- None of the participants chose a key size smaller than 2048 for their RSA key. Fifteen participants chose 2k-sized keys, and eight chose 4k-sized keys.
- Five out of the 28 participants deployed the certificate chain correctly, which is necessary to receive a grade better than B.
- Two participants did not use the study CA and used self-signed certificates.
- Only one participant enabled a TLS version lower than TLS 1.0 (P8), and another had all versions but TLS 1.2 disabled (P14).
- Only two participants configured RC4 support, and only one configuration (P8) was vulnerable to the POODLE attack as SSL 3 was still supported.
- Fourteen participants fully configured forward secrecy, and the remaining participants with valid configurations managed to at least partially support it.
- Eleven participants included HSTS headers to improve the security of their configuration, and only two participants deployed HPKP.

To determine whether the distribution of SSL Test grades from our lab study reflects those found in real-world configurations, we compared our results with the estimation from SSL Pulse [6], which regularly publishes data sets of grade distribution measures based on the Alexa Top 1 Million. At the time of our study, the data set contained 141,890 surveyed sites, with 34.1% graded A, 20.2% B, 27.1% C, and 18.5% failing. Based on the 24 valid configurations from our study, 25% were graded A, 67% B, and 8% C. Given that the SSL Pulse data set includes websites with potentially higher security requirements or more time for administrators to obtain a secure configuration, our study may not be fully representative.

### 4.2 TLS Deployment Model
Our qualitative analysis of the think-aloud protocols yielded a process model for a successful TLS configuration. All participants who managed a valid configuration in the given time can be mapped to the stages presented in this model. The four participants who did not deploy TLS in the given time significantly deviate from this model.

We divide the steps from our model into two phases:
1. **Setup Phase**: Tasks to get a basic TLS configuration, i.e., the service is reachable via HTTPS if requested.
2. **Hardening Phase**: Tasks to get a configuration considered secure according to the metrics defined in Appendix A.

Figure 1 shows our deployment model. Participants who achieved at least a basic configuration successfully completed all steps of the setup phase, while better-graded configurations also completed some steps from the hardening phase. We identified iterative (tool-supported) security testing as a key element for a successful hardening phase, as participants relied on external sources to evaluate the quality of their configuration.

### 4.3 Usability Challenges in TLS Deployment
In the following, we present the usability challenges identified through our analysis of qualitative data from the think-aloud protocols and quantitative data from the collected log files.

**Searching for Information and Finding the Right Workflow**:
Except for three experienced participants who explicitly searched for tutorials they were aware of (e.g., bettercrypto.org), most participants visited a high number of websites and used multiple sources of information. The information sources varied in their suggested deployment approaches and information quality. We frequently observed that a participant started to follow an approach from one tutorial and soon had to switch to another as the presented approach was not feasible for our deployment scenario and the given server configuration.

- The lowest number of visited websites during the lab study was 20 (P21).
- In contrast, participant P4 visited 147 websites during the given time.
- The average number of visited websites was 70.
