ATT&CK ID:M1038
ATT&CK Technique Name:Execution Prevention
Use read-only containers, read-only file systems, and minimal images when possible to prevent the execution of commands.[11] Where possible, also consider using application control and software restriction tools (such as those provided by SELinux) to restrict access to files, processes, and system calls in containers.[12]
