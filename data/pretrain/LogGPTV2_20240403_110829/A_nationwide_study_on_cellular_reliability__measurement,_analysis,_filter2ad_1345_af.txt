### Cellular Network Research and Reliability

Researchers have developed tools and platforms for measuring cellular network performance, including device-to-device communications [33, 44] and various aspects of cellular networks such as bandwidth, delay, base station (BS) density, and signal coverage [23, 30, 41]. However, only a few studies have focused on cellular reliability, which is both less familiar to the community and more challenging to measure and analyze. For instance, Hui et al. [20] at T-Mobile used a cross-layer measurement strategy to understand Data_Stall failures and their impact on mobile Quality of Experience (QoE). They analyzed data from both BSes and user devices, uncovering root causes such as link corruptions, packet drops during radio state transitions, and issues with the radio network controller's scheduling algorithm.

#### Challenges in Cellular Reliability

Previous work has shown that BS and Radio Access Technology (RAT) handoffs can be difficult to manage in complex environments, leading to unreliability [28, 31] and unavailability [12, 43] of cellular services. Our study stands out due to its large user scale, extensive ISP/BS coverage, and comprehensive analysis of various cellular failures. We also conduct a joint analysis of phone hardware configurations, OS internals, BS characteristics, and BS-to-phone interactions to identify the reasons behind these failures.

#### Optimization Efforts

Measurement studies have highlighted potential areas for design and implementation improvements. Researchers have explored optimizations in congestion control [50, 55, 58], energy efficiency [9, 10, 18], and security [13, 25], as well as in specific scenarios like video streaming [52, 53], web browsing [54], and cellular-WiFi interaction [35, 40]. Some researchers have proposed using lower-layer cellular information to enhance upper-layer performance [52–55]. In contrast, our work identifies and explores unique optimization opportunities, in collaboration with a major Android phone vendor, to enable more reliable and faster recovery from severe cellular failures. Our solutions have been deployed on a large scale, yielding real-world impact.

### Discussion on Limitations

In §2, we present Android-MOD, which uses dedicated low-level system tracing and active network probing mechanisms, along with domain knowledge, to continuously and accurately capture cellular failures at scale. This monitoring infrastructure, deployed in the wild, provides a large dataset that reveals multifaceted problems related to both cellular infrastructure and mobile operating systems. However, our dataset and analyses have several limitations due to the limited cellular context information available from end-user devices.

For example, upon detecting Data_Stall occurrences, Android-MOD employs an active probing-based mechanism to measure durations and rule out false positives. While this method is time-bounded and lightweight, it may interfere with the cellular and network environments, potentially leading to measurement errors. Alternative passive monitoring mechanisms, such as those proposed by Hui et al. [20] and Wang et al. [48], are worth exploring. These methods monitor network packets to uncover the root causes of cellular problems but are more intrusive for user devices. We leave the exploration of non-intrusive passive methodologies for future work.

Due to the limited cellular context information collected by Android-MOD, some of our analyses in §3 may lack direct evidence and may deviate from the actual causes. For such cases, we provide best-effort validations by carefully considering different aspects of the dataset. To further demystify these issues, we plan to collaborate with mobile ISPs for more comprehensive research.

Additionally, our study does not include Android 11, as it was released after our measurement period. However, an examination of the source code in Android 11 indicates that many of the cellular reliability problems we identified remain, particularly the aggressive RAT transition policy and the lagging Data_Stall recovery mechanism. Therefore, our findings and proposed enhancements should also benefit the latest devices running Android 11.

### Conclusion

This paper presents our efforts to understand and address reliability issues in cellular networks. Despite prior focus on cellular performance and availability, fundamental reliability issues remain poorly understood at scale. We close this knowledge gap through a large-scale, crowdsourcing-based measurement study involving 70 million opt-in users. Collaborating with a major Android phone vendor, we developed and deployed a continuous monitoring platform to collect fine-grained, in-situ system traces. This allowed us to reveal the nationwide prevalence and frequency of cellular failures for the first time. We uncovered severe reliability problems in the cellular connection management of Android and the BS utilization and deployment strategies of mobile ISPs. Driven by these insights, we provide guidelines to tackle various cellular failures. Notably, some of our solutions have been adopted by 28 million users, generating significant real-world impact.
