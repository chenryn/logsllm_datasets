User: I'm looking for a Python function which behaves just like the Windows command interpreter cmd.exe when it comes to waiting for newly launched processes to finish. Right now I'm using  os.system() but this function always blocks, even when launching GUI applications (which, in case they were written in C/C++, have a WinMain function and were linked with /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS).
What code should I be using for launching external processes in case I do want the function to block when launching console applications, but I do not want it to block when launching GUI applications?
Assistant: Python has no standard way to examine the executables you can start with the process API.
How about you start the external command using cmd.exe? Or create a BAT script in %TEMP% and run that.
