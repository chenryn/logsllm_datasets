• An output VLAN interface cannot be an aggregated Ethernet interface.
• If the output VLAN has more than one member interface, then traffic is mirrored only to the first
member of the VLAN, and other members of the same VLAN do not carry any mirrored traffic.
• For remote port mirroring to an IP address (GRE encapsulation), if you configure more than one
analyzer session or port-mirror instance, and the IP addresses of the analyzers or port-mirror
instance are reachable through the same interface, then only one analyzer session or port-mirror
instance will be configured.
• The number of possible output interfaces in remote port mirroring varies among the switches in the
QFX5K line:
• QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5210—Support a maximum of 4 output interfaces
• QFX5100 and QFX5200—Support a maximum of 3 output interfaces.
• Whenever any member in a remote port mirroring VLAN is removed from that VLAN, reconfigure the
analyzer session for that VLAN.
Constraints and Limitations for QFX5100 and QFX5200 Switches
The following considerations apply to port mirroring on QFX5100 and QFX5200 switches:
• When configuring mirroring with output to IP address, the destination IP address should be
reachable, and ARP must be resolved.
• ECMP (Equal Cost Multiple Path) load balancing is not supported for mirrored destinations.
997
• The number of output interfaces in remote port mirroring (RSPAN) varies. For QFX5110, QFX5120,
and QFX5210, switches the maximum is four output interfaces. For QFX5100 and QFX5200
switches, the maximum is three.
• When specifying a link aggregation group (LAG) as the mirroring output interface, a maximum of
eight interfaces are mirrored.
• The mirroring input can be a LAG, a physical interface with any unit (such as ae0.101 or
xe-0/0/0.100), or a sub-interface. In any case, all the traffic on the LAG or physical interface is
mirrored.
• You cannot set up an independent mirroring instance on a member interface of a LAG.
• An output interface that is included in one mirroring instance cannot also be used in another
mirroring instance.
• In a port-mirroring instance, dropped packets in the egress pipeline of forwarding-path are never-the-
less mirrored to the destination. This is because the mirroring action occurs at the ingress pipeline,
before the drop action.
• In a port-mirroring instance, only one mirror output destination can be specified.
• Output mirror destinations that are configured across multiple port-mirroring or analyzer instances
must all be unique.
• For ERSPAN IPv6 addresses, egress mirroring is not supported when the output to the analyzer/port-
mirroring is a remote IPv6 address. Egress mirror is not supported.
• For local mirroring, the output interface must be family ethernet-switching, with or without VLAN
(that is, not a Layer 3 interface).
• When configuring a port-mirroring or analyzer instance in a service provider environment, use the
VLAN name rather than the VLAN ID.
Port Mirroring on QFX10000 Series Switches
The following list describes constraints and limitations that apply specifically to QFX10000 Series
switches. For general information about port mirroring on switches, see earlier sections in this Port
Mirroring and Analyzers document that do not specifically call out other platform names in the section
title.
• Only ingress global port mirroring is supported. You can configure global port mirroring with input
parameters such as rate , run-length, and maximum-packet-length. Egress global port mirroring is not
supported.
• Port mirroring instances are supported only for remote port mirroring. Port mirroring global instances
are supported for local mirroring.
998
• Local port mirroring is supported on these firewall filter families only: inet and inet6.
• Local port mirroring is not supported on firewall filter families any or ccc.
Port Mirroring on QFabric
The following constraints and limitations apply to local and remote port mirroring:
• You can create a total of four port-mirroring configurations.
• Each Node group in a QFabric system is subject to the following constraints:
• Up to four of the configurations can be used for local port mirroring.
• Up to three of the configurations can be used for remote port mirroring.
• Regardless of whether you are configuring a standalone switch or a Node group:
• There can be no more than two configurations that mirror ingress traffic. If you configure a
firewall filter to send mirrored traffic to a port—that is, you use the analyzer action modifier in a
filter term—this counts as an ingress mirroring configuration for the switch or Node group to
which the filter is applied.
• There can be no more than two configurations that mirror egress traffic.
•
On QFabric systems, there is no system-wide limit on the total number of mirror sessions.
• You can configure only one type of output in one port-mirroring configuration to complete a set
analyzer name output statement:
• interface
• ip-address
• vlan
• Configure mirroring in an analyzer (with set forwarding-options analyzer) on only one logical interface
for the same physical interface. If you try to configure mirroring on multiple logical interfaces
configured on a physical interface, only the first logical interface is successfully configured; the
remaining logical interfaces return configuration errors.
• If you mirror egress packets, do not configure more than 2000 VLANs on a QFX Series switch. If you
do, some VLAN packets might contain incorrect VLAN IDs. This applies to any VLAN packets, not
just the mirrored copies.
• The ratio and loss-priority options are not supported.
• Packets with physical layer errors are not sent to the output port or VLAN.
999
• If you use sFlow monitoring to sample traffic, it does not sample the mirror copies when they exit the
output interface.
• You cannot mirror packets exiting or entering the following ports:
• Dedicated Virtual Chassis interfaces
• Management interfaces (me0 or vme0)
• Fibre Channel interfaces
• Integrated routing and bridging (IRB) interfaces (also known as routed VLAN interfaces or RVIs)
• An aggregated Ethernet interface cannot be an output interface if the input is a VLAN or if traffic is
sent to the analyzer by using a firewall filter.
• When mirrored packets are sent out of an output interface, they are not modified for any changes
that might be applied to the original packets on egress, such as CoS rewriting.
• An interface can be the input interface for only one mirroring configuration. Do not use the same
interface as the input interface for multiple mirroring configurations.
• CPU-generated packets (such as ARP, ICMP, BPDU, and LACP packets) cannot be mirrored on egress.
• VLAN-based mirroring is not supported for STP traffic.
• (QFabric systems only) If you configure a QFabric analyzer to mirror egress traffic and the input and
output interfaces are on different Node devices, the mirrored copies will have incorrect VLAN IDs.
This limitation does not apply if you configure a QFabric analyzer to mirror egress traffic and the
input and output interfaces are on the same Node device. In this case the mirrored copies will have
the correct VLAN IDs (as long as you do not configure more than 2000 VLANs on the QFabric
system).
• True egress mirroring is defined as mirroring the exact number of copies and the exact packet
modifications that went out the egress port. Because the processors on QFX5xxx (including
QFX5100, QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5200, and QFX5210) and EX4600 (including EX4600 and
EX4650) switches implement egress mirroring in the ingress pipeline, those switches do not provide
accurate egress packet modifications, so egress mirrored traffic can carry incorrect VLAN tags that
differ from the tags in the original traffic.
• If you configure a port-mirroring instance to mirror traffic exiting an interface that performs VLAN
encapsulation, the source and destination MAC addresses of the mirrored packets are not the same
as those of the original packets.
• Mirroring on member interfaces of a LAG is not supported.
• Egress VLAN mirroring is not supported.
1000
Port Mirroring on OCX Series Switches
The following constraints and limitations apply to port mirroring on OCX Series switches:
• You can create a total of four port-mirroring configurations. There can be no more than two
configurations that mirror ingress or egress traffic.
• If you use sFlow monitoring to sample traffic, it does not sample the mirror copies when they exit the
output interface.
• You can create only one port-mirroring session.
• You cannot mirror packets exiting or entering the following ports:
• Dedicated Virtual Chassis interfaces
• Management interfaces (me0 or vme0)
• Fibre Channel interfaces
• Routed VLAN interfaces or IRB interfaces
• An aggregated Ethernet interface cannot be an output interface.
• Do not include an 802.1Q subinterface that has a unit number other than 0 in a port mirroring
configuration. Port mirroring does not work with subinterfaces if their unit number is not 0. (You
configure 802.1Q subinterfaces by using the vlan-tagging statement.)
• When packet copies are sent out the output interface, they are not modified for any changes that are
normally applied on egress, such as CoS rewriting.
• An interface can be the input interface for only one mirroring configuration. Do not use the same
interface as the input interface for multiple mirroring configurations.
• CPU-generated packets (such as ARP, ICMP, BPDU, and LACP packets) cannot be mirrored on egress.
• VLAN-based mirroring is not supported for STP traffic.

Mirroring might be needed for traffic analysis on a switch because a switch, unlike a hub, does not
broadcast packets to every port on the destination device. The switch sends packets only to the port to
which the destination device is connected.
Overview
Junos OS running on EX2300, EX3400, and EX4300 Series switches supports the Enhanced Layer 2
Software (ELS) configurations that facilitate analyzing traffic on these switches at the packet level.
You use port mirroring to copy packets to a local interface for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote
monitoring. You can use analyzers to enforce policies concerning network usage and file sharing, and to
identify sources of problems on your network by locating abnormal or heavy bandwidth usage by
specific stations or applications.
Port mirroring is configured at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring] hierarchy level. To mirror routed
(Layer 3) packets, you can use the port mirroring configuration in which the family statement is set to
inet or inet6.
You can use port mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port—You can mirror the packets in any combination of packets
entering or exiting ports up to 256 ports.
In other words, you can send copies of the packets entering some ports and the packets exiting other
ports to the same local analyzer port or analyzer VLAN.
• Packets entering a VLAN—You can mirror the packets entering a VLAN to either a local analyzer port
or to an analyzer VLAN. You can configure up to 256 VLANs, including a VLAN range and PVLANs,
as ingress input to an analyzer.
• Policy-based sample packets—You can mirror a policy-based sample of packets that are entering a
port or a VLAN. You configure a firewall filter to establish a policy to select the packets to be
mirrored and send the sample to a port-mirroring instance or to an analyzer VLAN.
You can configure port mirroring on the switch to send copies of Unicast traffic to an output destination
such as an interface, a routing-instance, or a VLAN. Then, you can analyze the mirrored traffic by using a
protocol analyzer application. The protocol analyzer application can run either on a computer connected
to the analyzer output interface or on a remote monitoring station. For the input traffic, you can
configure a firewall filter term to specify whether port mirroring must be applied to all packets at the
interface to which the firewall filter is applied. You can apply a firewall filter configured with the action
port-mirror or port-mirror-instance name to the input or output logical interfaces (including aggregated
Ethernet logical interfaces), to traffic forwarded or flooded to a VLAN, or traffic forwarded or flooded to
a VPLS routing instance. EX2300, EX3400, and EX4300 switches support port mirroring of VPLS (family
ethernet-switching or family vpls) traffic and VPN traffic with family ccc in a Layer 2 environment.
1002
Within a firewall filter term, you can specify the port-mirroring properties under the then statement in
the following ways:
• Implicitly reference the port-mirroring properties in effect on the port.
• Explicitly reference a particular named instance of port mirroring.
Configuration Guidelines for Port Mirroring and Analyzers on EX2300, EX3400, and EX4300 Switches
When you configure port mirroring we recommend that you follow certain guidelines to ensure that you
obtain optimum benefit from mirroring. Additionally, we recommend that you disable mirroring when
you are not using it and that you select specific interfaces for which packets must be mirrored (that is,
select specific interfaces as input to the analyzer) in preference to using the all keyword option that
enables mirroring on all interfaces and can impact overall performance. Mirroring only the necessary
packets reduces any potential performance impact.
With local mirroring, traffic from multiple ports is replicated to the analyzer output interface. If the
output interface for an analyzer reaches capacity, packets are dropped. Thus, while configuring an
analyzer, you must consider whether the traffic being mirrored exceeds the capacity of the analyzer
output interface.
You can configure an analyzer at the [edit forwarding-options analyzer] hierarchy.
NOTE: True egress mirroring is defined as mirroring the exact number of copies and the exact
packet modifications that went out the egress switched port. Because the processor on EX2300
and EX3400 switches implements egress mirroring in the ingress pipeline, those switches do not
provide accurate egress packet modifications, so egress mirrored traffic can carry VLAN tags that
differ from the tags in the original traffic.
Table 118 on page 1002 summarizes additional configuration guidelines for mirroring on EX2300,
EX3400, and EX4300 switches.

Overview
Port mirroring is used for traffic analysis on a switch because a switch, unlike a hub, does not broadcast
packets to every port on the destination device. The switch sends packets only to the port to which the
destination device is connected.
You configure port mirroring on the switch to send copies of Unicast traffic to either a local analyzer
port or an analyzer VLAN. Then you can analyze the mirrored traffic by using a protocol analyzer. The
protocol analyzer can run either on a computer connected to the analyzer output interface or on a
remote monitoring station.
You can use port mirroring to mirror any of the following:
• Packets entering or exiting a port—You can mirror the packets in any combination of packets
entering or exiting ports up to 256 ports.
In other words, you can send copies of the packets entering some ports and the packets exiting other
ports to the same local analyzer port or analyzer VLAN.
• Packets entering a VLAN on an ACX7024, ACX7100, ACX7509, EX2200, EX3200, EX3300,
EX4200, EX4500, EX4550, or EX6200 switch—You can mirror the packets entering a VLAN on an
analyzer VLAN. On EX3200, EX4200, EX4500, and EX4550 switches, you can configure multiple
VLANs (up to 256 VLANs), including a VLAN range and PVLANs, as ingress input to an analyzer.
• Packets exiting a VLAN on an EX8200 switch—You can mirror the packets exiting a VLAN on an
EX8200 switch to either a local analyzer port or to an analyzer VLAN. You can configure multiple
VLANs (up to 256 VLANs), including a VLAN range and PVLANs, as egress input to an analyzer.
• Statistical samples—You can mirror a statistical sample of packets that are:
• Entering or exiting a port
• Entering a VLAN on an ACX7024, ACX7100, ACX7509, EX2200, EX3200, EX3300, EX4200,
EX4500, EX4550, or EX6200 switch
• Exiting a VLAN on an EX8200 switch
You specify the sample number of packets by setting the ratio. You can send the sample to either a
local analyzer port or to an analyzer VLAN.
1007
• Policy-based sample—You can mirror a policy-based sample of packets that are entering a port or a
VLAN. You configure a firewall filter to establish a policy to select the packets to be mirrored. You can
send the sample to a local analyzer port or to an analyzer VLAN.
Configuration Guidelines for ACX7024, ACX7100, ACX7509, EX2200, EX3200, EX3300, EX4200,
EX4500, EX4550, EX6200, and EX8200 Series Switches
When you configure port mirroring, we recommend that you follow certain guidelines to ensure that you
obtain optimum benefit from the port mirroring feature. Additionally, we recommend that you disable
port mirroring when you are not using it and that you select specific interfaces for which packets must
be mirrored (that is, select specific interfaces as input to the analyzer) as opposed to using the all
keyword that enables port mirroring on all interfaces and can impact overall performance. You can also
limit the amount of mirrored traffic by using statistical sampling, setting a ratio to select a statistical
sample, or using a firewall filter. Mirroring only the necessary packets reduces any potential performance
impact.
With local port mirroring, traffic from multiple ports is replicated to the analyzer output interface. If the
output interface for an analyzer reaches capacity, packets are dropped. Thus, while configuring an
analyzer, you must consider whether the traffic being mirrored exceeds the capacity of the analyzer
output interface.
NOTE: On ACX5448 routers, under the [edit forwarding-options analyzer an input egress] hierarchy
level, analyser input must be configured only on .0 logical interfaces for ingress and egress
interfaces. If you configure logical interfaces other than .0, then an error is shown during commit.
The following is a sample commit error shown when the analyzer input is configured .100 logical
