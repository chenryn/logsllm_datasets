### Port Mirroring and Analyzer Configuration Guidelines

#### General Constraints and Limitations

- **Output VLAN Interface**: An output VLAN interface cannot be an aggregated Ethernet interface.
- **Multiple Member Interfaces in Output VLAN**: If the output VLAN has more than one member interface, traffic is mirrored only to the first member. Other members do not carry any mirrored traffic.
- **Remote Port Mirroring with GRE Encapsulation**: If multiple analyzer sessions or port-mirror instances are configured, and their IP addresses are reachable through the same interface, only one session will be active.
- **Maximum Output Interfaces for Remote Port Mirroring**:
  - QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5210: Support up to 4 output interfaces.
  - QFX5100 and QFX5200: Support up to 3 output interfaces.
- **Reconfiguration on VLAN Changes**: When a member of a remote port mirroring VLAN is removed, reconfigure the analyzer session for that VLAN.

#### QFX5100 and QFX5200 Switches

- **IP Address Reachability**: When configuring mirroring to an IP address, ensure the destination IP is reachable and ARP is resolved.
- **ECMP Load Balancing**: ECMP load balancing is not supported for mirrored destinations.
- **Output Interfaces in Remote Port Mirroring**:
  - QFX5110, QFX5120, QFX5210: Up to 4 output interfaces.
  - QFX5100 and QFX5200: Up to 3 output interfaces.
- **Link Aggregation Group (LAG) as Mirroring Output**: A maximum of 8 interfaces can be mirrored when LAG is used.
- **Mirroring Input**: Can be a LAG, a physical interface with any unit, or a sub-interface. All traffic on the LAG or physical interface is mirrored.
- **Independent Mirroring Instance on LAG Member**: Not allowed.
- **Unique Output Interfaces**: An output interface used in one mirroring instance cannot be used in another.
- **Egress Pipeline Dropped Packets**: These packets are still mirrored because the mirroring action occurs at the ingress pipeline.
- **Single Mirror Output Destination**: Only one mirror output destination can be specified per instance.
- **Unique Mirror Destinations**: Configured across multiple instances must be unique.
- **ERSPAN IPv6 Addresses**: Egress mirroring is not supported for remote IPv6 addresses.
- **Local Mirroring Output Interface**: Must be a family ethernet-switching interface, with or without a VLAN (not a Layer 3 interface).
- **Service Provider Environment**: Use the VLAN name rather than the VLAN ID when configuring a port-mirroring or analyzer instance.

#### QFX10000 Series Switches

- **Ingress Global Port Mirroring**: Supported with parameters like rate, run-length, and maximum-packet-length. Egress global port mirroring is not supported.
- **Port Mirroring Instances**: Supported for remote port mirroring. Global instances are supported for local mirroring.
- **Local Port Mirroring**: Supported on firewall filter families `inet` and `inet6`. Not supported on `any` or `ccc` families.

#### QFabric Systems

- **Ingress and Egress Traffic**: No more than 2 configurations each.
- **System-Wide Limit**: No system-wide limit on the total number of mirror sessions.
- **Analyzer Configuration**: Only one type of output (interface, IP address, VLAN) per configuration.
- **Logical Interface Configuration**: Configure mirroring on only one logical interface per physical interface.
- **VLAN Configuration**: Do not configure more than 2000 VLANs if egress mirroring is used.
- **Unsupported Options**: Ratio and loss-priority options are not supported.
- **Physical Layer Errors**: Packets with errors are not sent to the output port or VLAN.
- **sFlow Monitoring**: Does not sample mirror copies exiting the output interface.
- **Ports Excluded from Mirroring**:
  - Dedicated Virtual Chassis interfaces
  - Management interfaces (me0, vme0)
  - Fibre Channel interfaces
  - IRB interfaces
- **Aggregated Ethernet Interface**: Cannot be an output interface if the input is a VLAN or if traffic is sent to the analyzer using a firewall filter.
- **Packet Modifications**: Mirrored packets are not modified for egress changes.
- **Input Interface Uniqueness**: An interface can be the input for only one mirroring configuration.
- **CPU-Generated Packets**: Cannot be mirrored on egress.
- **STP Traffic**: VLAN-based mirroring is not supported.
- **Egress Traffic on Different Node Devices**: Mirrored copies may have incorrect VLAN IDs.
- **Egress Mirroring Accuracy**: Egress mirroring does not provide accurate packet modifications.
- **VLAN Encapsulation**: Source and destination MAC addresses of mirrored packets differ from the original.
- **Member Interfaces of LAG**: Mirroring is not supported.
- **Egress VLAN Mirroring**: Not supported.

#### OCX Series Switches

  - Dedicated Virtual Chassis interfaces
  - Management interfaces (me0, vme0)

- **Aggregated Ethernet Interface**: Cannot be an output interface.
- **Subinterface Unit Number**: Only unit number 0 is supported for 802.1Q subinterfaces.
- **Packet Modifications**: Mirrored packets are not modified for egress changes.
- **Input Interface Uniqueness**: An interface can be the input for only one mirroring configuration.
- **CPU-Generated Packets**: Cannot be mirrored on egress.
- **STP Traffic**: VLAN-based mirroring is not supported.
