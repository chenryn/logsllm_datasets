##### ISSUE TYPE
Feature Request
##### COMPONENT NAME
core
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    I just built from stable-2.1 branch
    ansible 2.1.1.0
    config file = /mnt/c/Users/james/Dropbox/aftermath/ansible-repo/ansible.cfg
    configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
Host patterns that include intersections end up applying the intersection onto
all patterns.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Applicable groups:
    [backend]
    lana
    [preagg]
    akira
    [dev-network]
    lana
    [cassandra_live_dcs]
    akira
Hosts from affected play
    - hosts:
        - backend:&cassandra_live_dcs:&dev-network
        - preagg
Even though `preagg` is it's own pattern, it's being intersected with the
groups from the first pattern. If I comment out the first hosts pattern, then
`akira` is correctly run. Since `akira` is also in `cassandra_live_dcs`, if I
remove `:&dev-network` then it works correctly.
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Since `akira` is in `preagg` I would expect it to have the play run on it.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Output from `--list-hosts`:
    (backend:&cassandra_live_dcs:&dev-network,preagg): backend:&cassandra_live_dcs:&dev-network,preagg    TAGS: [analyticsapi-preagg]
        pattern: [u'backend:&cassandra_live_dcs:&dev-network', u'preagg']
        hosts (1):
         lana
