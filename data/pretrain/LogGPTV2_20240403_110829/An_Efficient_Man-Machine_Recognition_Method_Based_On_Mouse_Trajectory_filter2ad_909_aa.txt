ABSTRACT
Behavioral authentication codes are widely used to resist abnor-
mal network traffic. Mouse sliding behavior as an authentication
method has the characteristics of less private information and easy
data sampling. This paper analyses the attack mode of the machine
sliding track data, extracts the physical quantity characteristics of
the sliding path. Features importance scores are used to select the
candidate features, and further Pearson correlation co- efficient
is used to filter out the features with high correlation. This paper
use XGBoost model as a classifier. In addition, an efficient evasion
attack detection method is proposed to deal with complex human
behavior evasion attacks. The experiment was carried out on two
mouse sliding datasets. The experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves 99.09% accuracy and 99.88% recall rate,
and can complete the man-machine identification in 2ms.

automated robots. HMI requires users to complete specified opera-
tions, such as input verification codes, graphics verification codes
and voice verification codes. The system identifies whether the user
completing the operation is a human or a robot program. Due to
the rapid development of image recognition technology, traditional
graphics verification code technology is easy to crack, and has been
gradually abandoned because of poor user experience. In essence,
slider type verification is used for human-machine identification by
using biological behavior characteristics, which is used in the scene
of registering new users, user login, preventing malicious operation
and data anti-crawlers. The recognition of machine behavior in
slider verification is not only whether the jigsaw puzzle can be
completed, but also analyzes the behavior trajectory data generated
by human users or robot programs, so as to quickly and accurately
return the results of human-machine judgment. Sliding verification
based on machine learning improves the attack cost and plays a key
role in dealing with the generation of malicious machine traffic[2].
Web-based automation technology is developing rapidly. In addi-
tion to user-defined automation technology through programming,
capture-replay technology on the web has become the focus of
research. Replay technology can be used to complete complex and
repetitive tasks, thereby reducing the workload of developers and
improving development efficiency[17]. Attacker programming cus-
tom sliding scheme is the machine sliding behavior in this paper.
Attacker uses capture-replay technology to slide slider. Because it
is a machine replaying human behavior, the method of machine
learning alone is not enough to identify. Therefore, an evasion
attack detection method is proposed, which combines with ma-
chine learning method to achieve more accurate human-machine
identification results.
Human-machine identification should have the features of fast
recognition, simple operation and high accuracy. This requires
that the machine learning model should be reliable, robust, causal,
scalable and universal, and it can control the input changes caused
by disturbance to affect the performance of the model. Finally, as
human-machine identification is applied in different scenarios, the
machine learning model should be highly portable[7].
This paper presents a mouse sliding track classification tech-
nique based on feature de-redundancy and XGBoost algorithm. In
this paper, the mouse sliding track is studied to extract the rele-
vant features of human behavior and robot program behavior. The
structure fractional gain method is used to filter out the important
features, and Pearson correlation coefficients between the features

are calculated to filter out the independent features. Finally, XG-
Boost model algorithm is used to learn features, and we can get a
more accurate and robust model.
The main contributions of this method are as follows:
(1) In terms of valid features, instead of directly using trajectory
features from other literatures, we used feature derivation and
de-redundancy methods, and selected two features obtained from
attack model study that are more effective in classifying machine
behavior, which make the trained models have better generalization
ability.
(2) Machine behavior based on behavior replay can avoid model
detection easily. We use behavior similarity based detection method
to detect replay behavior, and change the algorithm process to make
it perform better in time efficiency.
2 RELATED WORK
Human-machine validation based on slider-type validation codes
has been widely used in recent years. Machine behavior has evolved
from simple sliding to approximate human behavior, and the recog-
nition model has been optimized and improved. Machine learning
classification after extracting the sliding characteristics of human
and machine is the main research direction at present. Kang[9]
uses the method of feature group hierarchy and uses random forest
model training features to classify tracks. After feature extraction,
Zhang[21] describes in detail the construction process of the de-
cision tree for gradient promotion and the method of classifica-
tion learning, and compares the training effects of other models.
OuYang[13] mainly merges the XGBoost model with the lightGBM
model with the highest confidence level sample as the prediction
result. Xu[20] also used the random forest method to train the
model on a small sample set and achieved excellent results. The
above methods of human-machine identification only include the
comparison between human behavior and machine behavior. The
typical feature analysis of machine behavior is insufficient. The
validity of each feature was not considered in feature selection, for
example, whether there is a positive impact on the classification
results, or whether there is feature redundancy. Experiments on a
single dataset are not enough to verify the model performance also.
Solano[17] proposed the replay attack behavior in the article
and set up a replay attack algorithm to attack the machine learning
model. The attack success rate is as high as 87.3%. The algorithm
generates a new track by calculating a certain offset of the track,
which is a slide without direction restriction.We name this replay
attack as evasion attack.In this paper, we also consider the trajec-
tory in the case of pixel deviation. Unlike Solano[17], the human-
machine identification glide is a directional glide, and the end points
must match before a complete trajectory can be calculated. In the
evasion attack detection experiments, we consider the deviation
and discuss the influence of detection algorithm and deviation.
Similar to the human-machine recognition technology based on
mouse slider verification, mouse slide dynamics can also be used for
identity authentication. Due to the different habits of different peo-
ple operating the mouse, the behavior of different mouse operators
can be distinguished. Ma[11] et al. proposed a user authentication
method based on mouse-click behavior on a soft keyboard, which
models an unfixed mouse track and uses SVM and majority voting
to authenticate users. Shen[14] et al. proposed using kernel PCA to
map raw data to high-dimensional space using a non-linear map-
ping function to effectively solve behavioral variability. Antal[4]
uses Balabit public datasets to train motion-specific classifiers, and
uses two scenarios to evaluate sliding, clicking, and dragging be-
haviors, respectively. Studies show that dragging behavior is better
for classifying specific actions. Jorgensen[8] et al. evaluated the
authentication method based on mouse dynamics, performed exper-
iments on controlled environments, remote access scenarios, and
the impact of classifiers on the results, pointing out the drawbacks
of using this method, such as inadequate control of environmental
variables and too long verification time. Mouse dynamics-based
identity authentication method is not suitable for commercial plat-
forms with high access because of its cumbersome operation and
long authentication time.
3 MACHINE ATTACK MODEL
3.1 Direct Machine Behavior
Five direct attack modes were obtained by classifying the mouse
behavior of the robot program in the training dataset. Each of the
following plots is an X-Y and Time-X coordinate of the two sample
data.
(1) First Attack Mode
Figure 1: X-Y and Time-X of the first attack mode.
In the first attack mode, the robot program mimics the human
longitudinal offset and skips to another vertical level to continue
sliding after a short distance of lateral sliding. From the whole
track, there is no difference between the machine behavior and the
human behavior, but from the time displacement coordinates, we
find that there is no significant acceleration and deceleration of the
robot program behavior, and the sampling points are dense. Time-X
coordinates show that the mouse stays at the starting point for a
long time. Combined with the feature of slider verification code,
it is not difficult to deduce that the robot program clicks on the
starting point of the slider to get the shadow part location. Then
the length of sliding is calculated by image recognition or other
methods, and the sliding length is divided into several coordinate
points before sliding. Because the track collection process is from
the moment the slider is pressed, no sliding behavior occurs during
this period of time when the program first calculates the end point
of the slide, and a larger time difference occurs between two points
of normal human behavior.
(2) Second Attack Mode
In the second attack mode, similar to the first attack mode, the
program activates the shadow part by clicking the slider, which also
takes time to calculate the shadow position and sliding distance. By
observing the Time-x diagram, we can see that the robot program
imitated human acceleration and deceleration behavior to complete

machine behavior of the fourth attack mode is minimum or even 0.
The current attack mode is easy to distinguish human behavior.
(5) Fifth attack mode

the sliding at an extremely fast speed. By calculating the sample
data, we find that the acceleration time period generated by the
program behavior is much larger than the deceleration time period,
but the deceleration time period generated by human behavior is
larger than the acceleration time period. This feature is expressed
by numerical value, that is, the average value of the differential
speed as the distinguishing feature. From the trajectory point of
view, in the current attack mode, machine behavior produces little
vertical deviation but only lateral sliding. Therefore, the percentage
of vertically invariant path points over the entire sliding path is
proposed as the trajectory feature.
(3) Third Attack Mode
Figure 3: X-Y and Time-X of the third attack mode.
In the third attack mode, instead of spending a lot of time clicking
on the slider and activating the shadowed part, the robot program
moves at a near constant speed throughout the sliding process,
which is a shorter random jump motion from the slider track. Dif-
ferential displacement characteristics can play a key role in the
behavior where the distance between two points decreases when
the sample points are dense. When investigating current attack
patterns, we found that there are a large number of identical robot
program behavior tracks, and feature similarity detection is also
applicable to machine behavior.
(4) Fourth Attack Mode
Figure 4: X-Y and Time-X of the fourth attack mode.
The fourth attack mode is an approximate uniform motion with
vertical deviation, moving to the next coordinate point every same
time interval, and the time interval is nearly equal due to sampling
delay. When calculating the variance of difference time, the numer-
ical values of human behavior fluctuate widely. The variance of
Figure 5: X-Y and Time-X of the fifth attack mode.
In the fifth attack mode, from the X-Y displacement diagram, we
can see that the trajectory of the machine behavior is irregular and
random, and the trajectory is chaotic. Under the time characteristic
sequence, there are multiple acceleration and deceleration motions
and abnormal acceleration phenomena in the machine behavior.
There is a large time span between the two adjacent acceleration
stages. Compared with human acceleration behavior, the robot
program can complete the acceleration quickly.
3.2 Evasion Attack
Mouse sliding evasion attacks require the establishment of attack
databases, which contain sliding tracks of different lengths that are
samples of real human mouse sliding behavior. In real environment,
the mouse sliding evasion attack uses image gray difference to
identify the location of the gap, records the center point or edge
of the gap as the end coordinate, calculates the distance difference
between the start and end coordinates, finds a sliding sample of
length in the attack library, and calculates the new coordinate point
and delay time. The track of an evasion attack resembles a fast jump
behavior, jumping from one current coordinate point to another or
not moving after a delay in interval.
Since the trajectory of evasion attack originates from real human
behavior, it is difficult for traditional machine learning feature
model methods to detect the evasion attack correctly.
When analyzing the sample set, we found not only human behav-
ior evasion attacks, but also identical or similar tracks in machine
behavior. When evasion attacks are performed with automated
tools such as Selenium or Quick Macro, the tracks may not be iden-
