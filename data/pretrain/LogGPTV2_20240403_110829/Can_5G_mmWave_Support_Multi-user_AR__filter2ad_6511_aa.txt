Abstract. Augmented Reality (AR) has been widely hailed as a repre-
sentative of ultra-high bandwidth and ultra-low latency apps that will
be enabled by 5G networks. While single-user AR can perform AR tasks
locally on the mobile device, multi-user AR apps, which allow multiple
users to interact within the same physical space, critically rely on the cel-
lular network to support user interactions. However, a recent study showed
that multi-user AR apps can experience very high end-to-end latency
when running over LTE, rendering user interaction practically infeasible.
In this paper, we study whether 5G mmWave, which promises signiﬁcant
bandwidth and latency improvements over LTE, can support multi-user
AR by conducting an in-depth measurement study of the same popular
multi-user AR app over both LTE and 5G mmWave.
Our measurement and analysis show that: (1) The E2E AR latency over
LTE is signiﬁcantly lower compared to the values reported in the previ-
ous study. However, it still remains too high for practical user interaction.
(2) 5G mmWave brings no beneﬁts to multi-user AR apps. (3) While 5G
mmWave reduces the latency of the uplink visual data transmission, there
are other components of the AR app that are independent of the network
technology and account for a signiﬁcant fraction of the E2E latency. (4)
The app drains 66% more network energy, which translates to 28% higher
total energy over 5G mmWave compared to over LTE.
1 Introduction
Augmented Reality (AR) promises unprecedented interactive and immersive
experiences to users by augmenting physical objects in the real world with
computer-generated perceptual information. As such, a complete AR app often
needs to perform several challenging tasks to understand and interact with the
physical environment, such as pose estimation or object detection [1].
While single-user AR can potentially perform AR tasks locally on the mobile
device [9], multi-user AR apps, also known as networked AR apps, which allow
multiple users to interact within the same physical space, critically rely on the
cellular network and often a cloud server to support user interactions. Further,

to provide high-quality, interactive experience, such networked AR apps need to
perform the needed AR tasks (e.g. pose estimation and synchronization to the
same physical environment) at very low latency, which places high uplink band-
width demand on the wireless network. It is because of this stringent network
requirement that networked AR has been widely viewed as one of the “killer”
apps for 5G [10,29,38], e.g., in the AT&T and Microsoft alliance as well as the
Verizon and AWS alliance to showcase 5G edge computing solutions [11,39].
Previously, Apicharttrisorn et al. conducted an in-depth measurement
study [8] of a popular two-user app that performs the most basic multi-user
interaction, i.e., displaying an object, to study whether LTE can support the
needed QoE of multi-user AR. That study showed that the latency from the
moment a user (host) places a virtual object in the physical environment to the
moment a second user (resolver) sees that object in their screen is 12.5 s in the
median case and can be as high as 26 s over LTE, which renders the most basic
user interaction in multi-user AR apps practically infeasible.
5G mmWave is being rapidly deployed by all major mobile operators promis-
ing ultra-high bandwidth and lower latency compared to 4G LTE. As an exam-
ple, Table 1 shows the uplink and downlink TCP throughput (measured with
iperf3), the end-to-end (E2E) round trip latency (measured with ping), and
the RAN latency (approximated as the round trip latency to the ﬁrst hop
router) between a mobile device and a Google Cloud server. We observe that 5G
mmWave oﬀers 16x higher downlink throughput and 3.4x higher uplink through-
put compared to LTE while it reduces the RAN (E2E) latency by 56% (42%).

Driven by these initial observations, in this paper we revisit the previous
feasibility study of multi-user AR over cellular networks by conducting an in-
depth measurement study of the same popular multi-user AR app side-by-side
over both LTE and 5G mmWave. Our dataset is publicly available [2]. Our
study tries to answer two key questions: (1) Can 5G mmWave provide much
better support for multi-user interactions in AR compared to LTE to the extent
that real-time multi-user interaction becomes feasible? (2) Does multi-user AR
drain signiﬁcantly more energy under 5G compared to under LTE?
The main ﬁndings of our study are as follows: (1) The E2E latency over
LTE is signiﬁcantly lower (by 6.6 s) compared to the values reported in [8],
however, it remains too high for real-time multi-user AR apps. (2) 5G mmWave
does not reduce the E2E latency of the AR app compared to LTE in spite of
its much higher bandwidth and lower RTT. (3) While 5G mmWave yields a
small reduction to the latency of the uplink visual data transmission, there are
other components of the AR app that contribute signiﬁcantly to the E2E latency
regardless of the underlying cellular technology. In addition, we discovered a new

latency component between the cloud and the resolver, which was not reported
in [8], and is often a major contributor to the E2E latency. (4) The app drains
on average 66% more network energy over 5G mmWave compared to over LTE.
Since the network energy accounts for about 32% of the total energy, such high
network energy diﬀerence translates into smaller (but still signiﬁcant) diﬀerence
in the total app energy drain, by 23% on the host and 43% on the resolver.
2 Background and Related Work
2.1 Multi-user AR
Current mobile AR systems like Google ARCore
[4], Apple ARKit [3], and
Microsoft Hololens [6] use SLAM to construct a 3D coordinate structure of the
physical world and get an estimation of the user’s location and orientation (pose).
The users ﬁrst need to share their coordinates to create a common and consistent
real-world coordinate system. Once a virtual object is placed on the screen,
SLAM is run to get an estimation of the device’s current pose and the real-
world coordinate features, and objects in the user’s ﬁeld of view are rendered
on the screen. Popular multi-user AR apps on the market, enabled by Google
ARCore, Apple ARKit, or Microsoft Hololens oﬄoad most of the computations
to cloud servers to reduce the workload on the phones. In the following, we brieﬂy
describe the workﬂow of such applications, shown in Fig. 1.
The host initiates a connection with a cloud based Firebase [5] database
by creating a room ID (R). The resolver uses the same room ID and waits for
incoming connections from the host via the cloud. After an object is placed on
the host’s screen, the following events take place.
1. Hosting device: (a) Device Handshakes. The host places an object and
two connections to Google Cloud are instantiated for object positioning. (b)
Visual Data Transmission. The host sends the real world visual information
about the overlaid virtual object to the cloud. (c) Cloud Processing. The

cloud processes the host’s visual data. It sends back the SLAM-computed world
frame to the host and notiﬁes the resolver to start the resolution process.
2. Resolving device:(a) Cloud Connection Initiation. The Firebase noti-
ﬁes the resolver to start a connection with the Google Cloud instance. The
resolver scans the world frames through camera and pre-processes the data. (b)
Data Transmission. On getting notiﬁed by the cloud, the resolver uploads its
visual data to the cloud. (c) Cloud Processing. The cloud, on receiving the
resolver’s frames, tries to match them against the host’s SLAM-computed data,
estimates the pose of the resolver in the world frame and send its back to the
resolver. If the cloud processing fails (e.g., because the environment lacks visual
features, such as high contrast edges, colors, etc.), the cloud asks the resolver
to upload new visual data. Hence, this process might involve multiple rounds of
communication and cloud processing. In the following, we include only the ﬁrst
round of communication in the data transmission delay (2b), while any addi-
tional rounds of communication are included in the cloud processing delay (2c).
(d) Object Rendering. The resolver uses the data from the cloud to estimate
the virtual object’s pose and display it on its screen.
We note that there may be an additional delay before the notiﬁcation of the
hosted object is received by the resolver, denoted as 2x: Notiﬁcation delay in
Fig. 1. This delay was not reported in [8], but it is often a major contributor to
the E2E latency in our experiments.
2.2 Related Work
Multi-user AR. Unlike single-user AR (e.g., [9,12,22,31]), there have been very
few works on multi-user AR. A few works [30,32,44] focus on application layer
sharing while our work focuses on the impact of the cellular network in multi-user
AR performance. In contrast to [8], which studies multi-user AR performance
over LTE, our work is the ﬁrst to our best knowledge to study the performance
and energy consumption of multi-user AR over 5G mmWave. A few recent works
study edge-assisted [34] or P2P-based [33] multi-user AR. In contrast, our work
focuses on cloud-assisted multi-user AR, which is the default approach in most
popular AR apps on the market.
5G mmWave Performance. A few recent studies focus on early-stage 5G
mmWave performance and its impact on downlink-oriented mobile apps (web
browsing and video streaming) [24–26]. To our best knowledge, there is no other
work studying the impact of 5G mmWave on multi-user AR, which has very
diﬀerent application and communication features compared to web browsing or
video streaming.

Multi-user AR Application. Google’s Cloud Anchor API [4] forms the foun-
dation for most of the cloud-based, multi-user AR Android apps today. We used

in [8]. The application lets a user place a virtual object on a real-world surface
while another user can view it.
Devices. We used two Google Pixel 5 phones for our experiments. For the
measurements involving the LTE network, we disabled the 5G radio through the
phone’s settings.
5G Carrier and Location. We conducted uplink throughput measurements
in three diﬀerent cities over two diﬀerent cellular operators (Table 2). Based on
these measurements, we selected Boston and Verizon for our experiments in this
work, as that was the combination that provided the highest throughput. We
used Verizon’s NSA-based 5G service that provides mmWave coverage over the
28/39 GHz frequency bands (n260/261).
Experimental Methodology. We conducted our experiments near the down-
town of Boston, at two diﬀerent locations. At each location, we stood 80 ft away
from the base station (BS); we conﬁrmed via SpeedTest measurements that this
distance yielded the maximum possible uplink throughput. The experiments at
each location spanned a 1-week period. All measurements were done at day time,
from 9 am to 5 pm. For 5G mmWave, we consider two cases – when the users
face towards the BS and when they face away from the BS; in the later case,
their bodies block the Line of Sight (LOS) between the BS and the UE.
Measurement Tools. To extract the end to end latency of the AR app, we mod-
iﬁed the app to log the Unix timestamps and captured packets with timestamps
via tcpdump. We also extracted low-level, signalling messages using MobileIn-
sight [20].
4 Performance of Multi-user AR
We begin our study by comparing the E2E latency of the AR app over LTE
and 5G mmWave in Sect. 4.1 and then study the individual app components
in Sect. 4.2–4.5. Finally, in Sect. 4.6, we study the impact of two optimizations,
which were shown in [8] to improve the latency over LTE networks. Figure 2
plots the E2E latency as well as the latency of the individual components over
20 runs.

4.1 End to End Performance
From Fig. 2, we make the following observations: (i) The E2E latency over LTE
is signiﬁcantly lower compared to the numbers reported in [8]. The median (max-
imum) latency is 5.9 s (14 s) vs. 12.5 s (27 s) in [8]). We conjecture that this
reduction may be due to diﬀerent levels of congestion in the LTE network and
the cloud and/or technological advances in the LTE network and the UEs. How-
ever, the latency remains unacceptably high and severely impacts the user QoE.
(ii) 5G mmWave, when the user faces the BS, reduces the worst-case E2E latency
by more than 2 s. However, surprisingly, the median latency and the 75-th per-
