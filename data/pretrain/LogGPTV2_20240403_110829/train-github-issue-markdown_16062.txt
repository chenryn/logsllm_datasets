  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
There is a search page with infinite height(lazy load paging) for
scrolling.When i clicked an item of search results on this page, i go to
search detail page.That's ok for now.Then i want to go back the search page, i
've expected that the search page has rendered and after that set the past
scroll position whose selected item on search results has.
## Current Behavior
But my last scroll position of search page has been kept but it set scroll
before rendering search page.This causes that the search page
flickers.Actually this flicker is more explicit on mobile than on web.
