**Current behavior**
When interpolation delimiters are changed to `[[` and `]]`, having an
unescaped `{` in template still throws an error (including `{{`).
**Expected behavior**
`{` should be allowed in templates if interpolation delimiters are changed.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
One would normally change interpolation string because one needs `{{` for
something else (eg. LaTeX syntax uses `{` heavily).
