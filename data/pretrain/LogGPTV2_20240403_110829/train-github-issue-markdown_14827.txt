### Current Behavior

When the interpolation delimiters are changed to `[[` and `]]`, an unescaped `{` in the template (including `{{`) still triggers an error.

### Expected Behavior

If the interpolation delimiters are changed, the use of `{` in the template should be allowed without causing an error.

### Minimal Reproduction

You can reproduce the issue using the following Plunker: [http://plnkr.co/edit/5Kl9w2Mpct9z7ljEgogS?p=preview](http://plnkr.co/edit/5Kl9w2Mpct9z7ljEgogS?p=preview)

### Motivation / Use Case

The primary reason for changing the interpolation delimiters is to use `{{` for other purposes, such as in LaTeX syntax, which heavily relies on `{`.
