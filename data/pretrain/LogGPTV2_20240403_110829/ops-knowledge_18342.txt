User: I have a Python script that sends output to a DOS command window (I am using Windows 7) using the print() function, but I would like to prevent (or hide) the cursor from blinking at the next available output position.  Has anyone any idea how I can do this?  I have looked at a list of DOS commands but I cannot find anything suitable.
Any help would be appreciated.

Assistant: I'm surprised nobody mentioned that before, but you actually don't need any library to do that.
Just use print('\033[?25l', end="") to hide the cursor.
You can show it back with print('\033[?25h', end="").
It's as easy as that :)
