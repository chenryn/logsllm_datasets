User: Please list common network layer protocols and briefly describe what each protocol does.
Assistant: 1. IP protocol (Internet Protocol): responsible for realizing packet switching and routing functions, and is the core protocol of Internet transmission. 2. ICMP protocol (Internet Control Message Protocol): used to transmit control messages in the IP network, such as network and host status, error reports, etc. 3. ARP protocol (Address Resolution Protocol): Map the IP address to the MAC address so that the data packet can be correctly sent to the destination host. 4. OSPF protocol (Open Shortest Path First): Used in routing protocols, responsible for calculating the shortest path and selecting the next-hop router. . 5. BGP protocol (Border Gateway Protocol): It is used for inter-autonomous system routing between the Internet, and is used to realize large-scale inter-autonomous system networks on the Internet. 6. VPN protocol (Virtual Private Network): Build a virtual private network so that remote users can safely access resources in the private network. 7. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): A protocol for dynamically assigning IP addresses, which can effectively manage the use of IP addresses. 8. IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol): Multicast group management protocol, used for member management of multicast groups. 9. IPSec protocol (Internet Protocol Security): It provides encryption, authentication and integrity protection to protect the transmission security of IP data packets in the network.
