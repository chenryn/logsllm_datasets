User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Access single user mode from the ubuntu live cd boot menu I have an ubuntu live image booting onto on my eeepc. I copied it onto one of the harddrives. I can't log into it. However, there's a file from another partition I want on it. I thought I could log into single usermode. However editing the 'install ubuntu' or 'try ubuntu' boot menu options and adding 'single' etc, didn't work. The installer boot loader isn't grub, is it? Is there someway to boot into single user mode on it?

Assistant: boot the disc
select your language
press ESC
select "OK" to leave graphical
type "live single"
press enter
when the menu pops up, select "drop to root shell prompt"
