User: I got the following error while executing a python script on appium 
ImportError: No module named appium
I am running appium in one terminal and tried executing the test on another terminal. Does anyone know what is the reason for this error? and how to resolve it?
Assistant: Try to use nosetest.
Install:
pip install nose
Run:
nosetests (name of the file containing test)
