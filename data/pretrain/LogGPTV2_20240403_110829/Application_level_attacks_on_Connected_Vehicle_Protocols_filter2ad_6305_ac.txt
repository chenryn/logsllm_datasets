attack.
Causing a Collision: In this attack, the followers of a
platoon that is controlled by a compromised leader, fail to
see and stop for stationary or slower vehicles. The malicious
car may have acquired leadership of the platoon using the
platoon takeover attack. The attacker can suddenly veer out

age speed of two platoons in the scenario in the absence of an
attack. The rear platoon starts a little later, but both platoons
accelerate to 40mph before cruising at that speed. Fig. 7b
shows the behavior of the platoons in the presence of the
attack. In this case, the rear platoon accelerates aggressively,
reaching the maximum velocity, in an effort to catch up with
the front platoon.
Attack 2– Fake Obstacle attack: From Fig. 8a, we see a
platoon of 3 cars accelerating to 60mph. After initiating the
attack starting around time 20s, we can notice how the platoon
suddenly comes to a halt as shown in Fig. 8b. This occurs for a
certain time then the platoon changes the lane and accelerates
again, but the attack can be repeated.
Attack 3– Merging platoons across lanes: In this scenario,
two platoons travel on different lanes where the front platoon
is slower than the rear one. The attacker realizes that both
platoons are close to each other and locates itself in front of the
rear platoon. Next, the attacker initiates the merge maneuver
as described in Attack 3. When the attack succeeds, all the
members of the rear platoon will follow the front platoon
(despite being in a different lane) and travel according to its
speed as shown in Fig. 9. In this case, the lower speed platoon
slows down the trafﬁc ﬂow. In another case, the rear platoon
may be tricked to go faster than the optimal speed for the lane,
compromising safety.
Attack 4– Platoon Takeover Attack: The attacker starts
with sending different beacon messages pretending that they
come from a front platoon. Once the platoon ﬁnds that the
leading vehicle on the same lane is the last platoon member
that it listens to (through its LiDAR sensor), it will then start

platoons. These scenarios allow us to evaluate the isolated
impact of the attacks.
Attack 1– Distant Merging attack: Our intention in this at-
tack is to make some platoons go to the catch-up process
where they speed up abnormally for some time potentially
degrading both safety and efﬁciency. Fig. 7a shows the aver-
USENIX Association        22nd International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses 465California Department of Transport provides real time traf-
ﬁc condition through Performance Measurement System [4]
by using various sensors installed in the state’s most highways
sections. We use data from a section of the highway I-5 in
south California and generate scenarios with vehicles enter-
ing stochastically following the observed distribution. Each
scenario, ran for 5 minutes, simulates the entrance of trafﬁc
into a highway section of length 6 miles. We assume that all
vehicles are CV enabled to avoid making assumptions on the
interactions of CV and non-CV vehicles. We conﬁgure about
25% of the vehicles to form platoons of different sizes. The
maximum speed for the road is 70 mph. The communication
range for each vehicle is 300 meters. Each road has ﬁve lanes
and approximately evenly spaced road side units (RSU) such
that all points in the highway are in range with at least one
RSU.
Attack 1–Distant Merging Attack: Fig. 11a shows the ef-
fects of attack 1 on the average speed, ﬂow, average speed dif-
ference, and average TTC for the scenario. The attack causes
an increase in average speed and ﬂow of trafﬁc. Even though
the ﬂow of vehicle increases by a small amount, the attack
causes vehicles under attack to travel at a much higher speed,
thus compromising safety, which is reﬂected by the increased
average speed difference and reduced TTC. Even though the
ﬂow of vehicle increases by a small amount, distant merge
attack causes vehicles under attack to travel at a much higher
speed, thus compromising safety.
Attack 2– Fake Obstacle Attack: Fake obstacle attack
causes the trafﬁc to slow down potentially abruptly, simi-
lar to the slow down due to road site construction. Thus, it has
slight adverse effect on safety, with increased average speed
difference and TTC, but a large effect on the mobility, with
decreased average speed and ﬂow, as depicted in Fig. 11b.
Attack 3– Merging across lanes: In this attack, the attacker
connects the ﬂow of trafﬁc of two or more lanes, forcing a
faster platoon to slow down. The effect of the attack is shown
in Fig. 11c. Average speed difference increases only slightly,
while TTC increases, leading to a marginal impact on safety.
However, the ﬂow of the trafﬁc is severely hindered which is
shown by the steep drop in average speed and ﬂow.
Attack 4– Platoon takeover: In this attack, the attacker takes
over the control of a platoon and can control it fully. This is the
most dangerous form of attack that the attacker can carry out.
Although different arbitrary maneuvers are possible once the
attacker controls the platoon, we went with a speed reduction
and repeated lane change maneuvers. Both safety and mobility
metrics are highly affected by this attack, as seen in Fig. 11d.
7 Potential Mitigation
Our eventual goal is to develop a defense approach that is
automated and can mitigate the vulnerability classes we iden-
tiﬁed in Table 1, thus making the protocol logic more secure
in a principled way. The general defense approach relies on
(a) Before attack
(b) After attack
Figure 10: Speed proﬁle in attack 4 (platoon takeover attack)
the merging process. After the merging succeeds, the attacker
now acts as a platoon leader and controls this platoon in any
way it desires within the platoon operational parameters. For
this example attack, the attacker decreases the platoon veloc-
ity and then repeatedly changes the lane of the platoon in
order to affect as many lanes as many as possible. Fig. 10
shows the platoon speed changes.
6.3 Attacks within trafﬁc scenarios
Next, we evaluate the impact of the attacks when applied as
part of an active trafﬁc scenario. We use different metrics to
quantitatively analyze the effects of the attacks on Mobility
and Safety. For mobility, we use two metrics: (1) Average
speed of vehicles is a common metric for mobility; and (2)
Flow of trafﬁc, is deﬁned as the number of vehicles passing
a point on the road in a given time. To measure safety, we
also use two metrics: (1) Average speed difference between
consecutive vehicles measures the differences in speed among
vehicles. This metric is known to correlate with the onset
of collisions and near-collisions; and (2) Time-to-Collision
(TTC) [23] is metric for safety which measures the time taken
for a vehicle to collide with the vehicle in front of it, should
they maintain the same speed. TTC of vehicle i at instant t
can be calculated as follows,
T TCi(t) =
Vi(t)−Vi−1(t)− li
Vi(t)−Vi−1(t)
here, Vi(t) stands for the speed of the vehicle i at instant t and
li is the length of the vehicle i.

tween message sources and other physical objects. This check
would defeat the replay attack that allows the adversary to
initiate a merge. V4 can be addressed by in depth protocol
testing and analysis. Finally, V5 can be addressed by either
avoiding trust delegation or verifying delegated decisions.
We collect complementary information through a reliable
sensory system to protect against fake message contents (V1).
Validating protocol components by linking message contents
and redundant sensor data is also desirable for a reliable de-
cision. The consistency of the application and environment
constraints using a robust algorithm need to be considered to
prevent a message with clearly unfeasible information to be
acted on and ensure that the resulting action is consistent with
the protocol logic. If everything checks out, a ﬁnal decision
will be assigned to protocol controller to lead the required
action.
7.1 Preliminaries and Assumptions
RSU: Defense components infrastructure: The main com-
ponent that we rely on in our scheme is the road side unit
(RSU), where its hardware and software components are spec-
iﬁed by US DOT [26]. The RSU is a more sophisticated and
more protected component of the system deployed and man-
aged by the infrastructure provider, making it an attractive
component to root defenses. It is expected to operate unat-
tended in harsh outdoor environments for extended periods of
time (typical Mean Time Between Failures of 100,000 hours).
It detects and auto-recovers from minor software failures,
transient power spikes, and power interruptions. We consider
a case where RSUs are reachable from any point on the high-
way as a proof of concept, but the protocol can be made to
act conservatively in Safe mode when RSU are not reachable.
We note that without relying on the RSU, the alternative
is to reach consensus between the different cars which is an
interesting possibility. A naive implementation could be too
costly to achieve on-demand, and therefore we elected to root
our defenses in the RSU.
Safe mode and functionality of RSU: We identify a safe
operation mode for platoons with respect to any maneuver or
protocol state. The goal of the safe mode is to be used as a
cautious behavior when protocol exchanges are in progress,
or when a decision cannot be made. For example, the platoons
could either maintain their speed or slow down and wait for
conﬁrmation after sending a maneuver request. The defense
proceeds by having the RSU check the the proposed action
against the conﬁguration of the platoon (e.g., the location of
each member of the relevant platoons from all basic safety
messages (BSMs) it collects). The RSU uses, as a source of
redundant information, a video tracking system to track the ve-
hicle locations. The system also maps any incoming messages
to vehicles based on the geographic information to check the
consistency of messages being sent by any particular vehicle.

augmenting the information available to vehicles with a redun-
dant source of information that enables detection of incorrect
or malicious information, and makes the protocol logic more
robust. If such a source of redundant information is avail-
able, the veracity of the exchanged messages can be checked
before conducting critical actions within a maneuver, thus
addressing V1 and V2 vulnerabilities. To give an example, if
a merge is attempted with a far-away platoon, the requested
platoon should check if the distance of the front platoon is
within the merge range; previously, this was assumed from
the fact that the messages were received from the front pla-
toon, an assumption that can be exploited by an attacker that
replays a message (effectively extending its reach) or to use
higher power radio to increase its range. Moreover, this de-
fense substantially reduces the opportunities for V3 attacks

Other sources of redundancy are also possible, for example,
exchange of past information from nearby RSUs for vehicle
tracking, or alternative real time sensors. Our proposed video
tracking system is feasible: many vehicles tracking systems
using video cameras have been proposed [29], [28]. We would
next see how the defense would work for the previous attacks.
7.2 Defense overview
Defense against Merging attacks: For Attacks 1, 3, and 4,
the defense starts by allowing the back platoon to send a
merging request to RSU. After receiving the maneuver re-
quest, the RSU veriﬁes the relevant information. Then, it tests
if the merge process is applicable or not by inspecting the
constraints between the platoons such as making sure that the
distance between them is within the permissible range. If all
checks pass, an approval reply is sent to the two platoons to
start merging. If the maneuver conﬁrmation is received and
leader, for any reason does not exist, the platoon members can
start a voting process where they study the collected BSMs
and check its neighbor vehicles through its sensors to choose
their leader to control the maneuver.
Defense against Obstacle attacks: For Attacks 2, RSU car-
ries out the same steps regarding requesting a maneuver. For
this scenario, it checks speciﬁcally if the obstacle and the
incoming platoon are in the same lane or not and, if yes, the
distance between them. Then, the RSU will send an approval
reply to stop the coming platoon or change its lane. In the
meantime, the traveling platoon leader will go to the safe
mode where it moves within the safety speed limit which we
deﬁned here to be below 20 mph. Generally, it is sufﬁcient
to ensure the ability to stop in case the obstacle message is
conﬁrmed. If the platoon does not receive any conﬁrmation
for the obstacle maneuver until the obstacle location, it can
start the backup protocol where it can stop or change lane.
Fig. 12 shows the general protocol for the RSU. Algorithm 1
shows the steps for the platoon leader.
