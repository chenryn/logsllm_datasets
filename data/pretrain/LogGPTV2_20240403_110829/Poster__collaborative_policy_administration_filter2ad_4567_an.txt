thirty neighborhoods within the London Borough of 
Camden with the aim of catalyzing the uptake of up to 
seventy five different actions related to reduced carbon 
emissions.  We realized that these aims were aligned to 
those of our DESIS project and that if these behaviors 
were changed via collaborative actions rather than 
those taken as individuals then the strategies to deliver 
such behavior changes could be viewed as ‘Public and 
Collaborative’ services.  The council was very positive 
about this proposal, even though government cuts and 
UK austerity conditions meant they could not provide 
any funding to the project.  The council agreed to 
some ‘in kind’ support in the form of staff time, which 
we felt was important for the success of the project.  
Consequently, Camden Council advisors provided 
specialist insights and expertise, as well as introductions 
to the community groups that make up the Camden 
Green Zones and also provided a commitment to help 
deliver, scale and transfer viable project outcomes.
Whilst it is common for us, as research staff, to work 
with students we do not have a regular scheduled plan 
of engagement within course curricula and typically 
must work with course directors a long way in advance 
to schedule student involvement in projects.  However, 
BA (Hons) Product Design approached us seeking a 
‘social innovation’ themed ‘client project’ for their 
graduating students and so student engagement in the 
Public and Collaborative project was possible at short 
notice.  To engage the BA (Hons) Product Design course 
team and students we created a student brief (Appendix 
1) that was circulated and eventually approved.  This 
positive response from the course team came despite 
not providing the usual client investment needed to 
secure such a client project.
3.  GREEN CAMDEN PUBLIC AND COLLABORATIVE 
PROJECT DELIVERY: CHALLENGES AND RESPONSES
As the project set up progressed we found that 
the course requirements were not an ideal fit for a 
co-design project linked to public and collaborative 
service design as they stipulated individual 3D 
products design outputs.  However, we recognized 
that product touchpoints9 could be a likely part of 
product/service system solutions that constitute public 
9 
 Shostack described touchpoints as ‘everything the consumer uses to 
verify their service’s effectiveness. She introduced thinking around 
touchpoints as part of services, using the term ‘service blueprinting’. 
See: Shostack, L. G. (1982). How to Design a Service. European 
Journal of Marketing, 16(1), 49-63 and Shostack, L. G. (1984). Design 
Services that Deliver. Harvard Business Review (84115), 133-139. 
and collaborative services, and also that co-design 
activity in the prototyping and realization of these 
product/service systems would allow for the course 
requirements to be met by the proposed project 
context and approach.  We proceeded on this basis.  
The challenges we faced in these initial stages were 
predominantly linked to two factors; (i) identification 
and engagement of communities with whom to 
collaborate and (ii) students’ limited knowledge and 
experience of service design, and its tools and methods 
and those of participatory/ collaborative design.
3.1. Identification and engagement of communities to 
collaborate with
We worked quickly and iteratively to create and deploy 
new methods and tools to crowd-source community 
collaborators and contexts.  To do this we worked with 
Camden Council.  Usually we would start such a project 
by engaging ‘duty-holders’ related to the context and 
issues being addressed by the project to be involved 
in the briefing of the students.  In this instance we had

to identify groups of ‘stakeholders’ (community groups) 
- not just ‘duty-holders’ (council staff, police etc) to co-
define the briefs for the projects and also to collaborate 
in findings appropriate for design responses.  We found 
that duty-holders are easier to engage in addressing 
issues for which they have a shared (and paid) 
responsibility.  They are also more easily contactable 
and able to dedicate time to the project during 
working hours.  Stakeholders have no such paid duty 
to engage and are typically more difficult to engage 
with.  Consequently, we needed to devise a strategy 
for identifying and communicating with stakeholders 
(community groups) in ways that would be accessible 
and useful to them.  We did this by setting up a weblog 
http://desisgreencamden.jimdo.com/ for the project 
and asking the council to contact all their Green Zone 
representatives to introduce our project opportunity 
and share the weblog address with the residents.  The 
weblog explained the brief for the project and asked 
residents who were interested in collaborating with 
our students to get in touch with us directly, or via 
Camden Council.  A template was provided for residents 
to use to describe the project that they required design 
assistance with and our aim was to match student 
groups with community projects.  Locating appropriate 
community projects to engage with was our biggest 
challenge as the timing of the project meant that 
identifying communities for collaboration with students 
would have to happen in parallel to the upskilling of 
the students, because even though we had got positive 
feedback from Camden, we still had to identify and meet 
the community groups that we hoped our students 
would be working with.  On reflection this fact may 
be the crux of why what turned out to be an excellent 
student learning experience and community project, 
didn’t develop in the way we anticipated. 
3.2. Students’ limited knowledge and experience of service 
design tools and methods and co-design practices
From the outset it was apparent that the 
undergraduate product design students were 
unfamiliar with the design challenge they faced.  
Although comfortable and highly skilled in 3D 
product design, they were unsure (and in a few cases 
even unhappy) about the requirement for them to 
understand and articulate a collaborative system or 
enterprise as a service before identifying product 
design opportunities that would facilitate its delivery.  
Furthermore they were concerned that both the 
articulation of the service and the diagnosis of the 
product design opportunities, and even the design 
and development of the product proposals, should be 
a participatory process – working with residents  - that 
would provide and use the product service system.
We found that the BA Product Design students we 
were working with had little experience or knowledge 
of service design10 methods and tools and little or no 
experience or knowledge of co-design or participatory 
design methods useful for working collaboratively 
with non-designers.  This was a significant problem 
given the focus of the project, as detailed in the brief 
(see: http://desisgreencamden.jimdo.com/brief/), which 
explicitly required students to use participatory design

techniques to work with neighborhood residents to 
map the systems (service blueprints) and journeys 
(physical and metaphorical) required to enable people 
(Camden residents) to take sustainable actions (a list 
of such actions is provided in the brief) as part of their 
daily routines, in a public and collaborative context (i.e. 
working together to instigate and implement behavior 
change rather than as individuals).  Consequently it was 
necessary for us to teach these skills to the students 
before engaging them in the delivery of the DESIS 
projects in collaboration with Camden residents.  To 
do this we asked students to find examples of existing 
projects that they felt could be described as public and 
collaborative services for sustainability and to map them 
as product service systems (or service blueprints).  Also 
to consider the experiences and journeys of those people 
that engage with the provision and use of the service.  
In short, we helped the students to deconstruct 
existing product service systems that constitute social 
innovations so as to gain an understanding of how 
they ‘worked’ in practice.  Finally, we asked the students 
to select one of the ‘desirable actions/behaviors’ for 
carbon reduction from the list provided by Camden 
Council and to explore how these behaviors might be 
reframed as services that were (i) public (delivered by 
and for members of the public) and (ii) collaborative 
(delivered by groups of people acting together).  
Students developed public and collaborative service 
proposals to present to community groups as a way 
of starting focused conversations around the brief.  
We explained that at this stage the proposals were 
hypothetical and were not necessarily those that the 
residents that responded to the call for collaboration 
(made via the weblog) would wish to collaboratively 
realize within their communities.
The students visualized their ideas and the proposals 
were uploaded to the weblog to give potential 
collaborating residents more information on the sort 
of projects that the students had been thinking of and 
were interested in developing and delivering with 
them within their communities. 
3.2.1 Problems we encountered linked to students’ 
limited knowledge and experience of service design 
tools, methods and co-design practices
Lack of service design knowledge base.  
Despite what the course handbook stated, 
the undergraduate students had very little

•

• 
experience/knowledge of service design tools 
and techniques and we found that introducing 
these competencies prior to commencing the 
collaborative and practice elements of the project 
took more time than we had anticipated. 
Undergraduate students’ understanding of the 
project’s primary aims and ambitions linked 
to the co-design approach was poor despite 
our efforts explaining and teaching it.  Some 
students clearly wanted to develop design 
concepts before engaging with the community, 
and some students rushed mapping activities 
that would be useful in identifying appropriate 
design interventions.  For example, we had 
described the need for design intervention 
to be considered only linked to the design of 
product ‘touchpoints’ that would enable service 
delivery and that appropriate touchpoints would 
emerge from interaction with the community 
and development of mapping techniques, not 
from students working alone.  However, because 
of course requirements for students to come up 
with three separate product design proposals, 
many of our students wanted to raise product 
ideas earlier than we wanted them to, or was 
advisable in the context of the Green Camden 
project.  This perceived conflict between 
the project requirements and their course 
requirements preoccupied some students and 
prevented them from concentrating fully on 
the methods that we were teaching that would 
enable identification of appropriate product 
proposals in due course.
Some students seemed to reject the idea of 
community engagement i.e. they did not want 
to engage with the community before trying 
to develop ideas and were uncomfortable 
relinquishing control over the authorship 
of designs within a collaborative design 
process.  This may have been linked to their 
understandings of course requirements, despite 
the assurances of their course tutors from outside 
the project.
Other students had a user-centered model of how 
to work with community groups regarding how 
to design touchpoints (products) rather than a 
co-design model i.e. they wanted to do it for them 
rather than with them, and saw community input 
as coming later in the form of consultation rather 
than collaboration.
In retrospect, we realize that we miscalculated at the 
outset the time needed to teach service design and 
collaborative design skills and techniques.  It took 
up much of the time we had anticipated would be 
used for community engagement.  Nor did we realize 
the course handbook requirements of the BA (Hons) 
Product Design course that appeared to contradict 
some of the Public and Collaborative projects aims and 
objectives.  In future we can easily redress both these 
issues with more preparation in the set-up/planning 
stages, however on this occasion the time lines we 
had to meet to enable our collaboration within the 
Public and Collaborative Thematic Cluster meant we 
had to proceed as best we could and learn what the 
barriers and enablers to delivery of the project might 
be through doing it. 
In an attempt to support the collaborative attempts 
of the undergraduate students we embraced a request 
for involvement from postgraduate students within 
the MA Applied imagination (MAAI) course at CSM 
who were interested in participating in a design-
led social innovation project.  MAAI students are 
from diverse disciplines and many have experience 
of professional practice prior to enrolling on the 
course.  MAAI student learning objectives include 
critical appraisal of design processes.  Consequently 
several students from MAAI where interested to learn 
more of the collaborative and participatory design 
processes that the DESIS project was engaged in, 
also the hegemonies that surround such processes.  
Their advanced experience, in comparison to the 
undergraduate cohort, meant that they were able 
to provide significant peer-to-peer support for the 
younger students.
Having established that the student cohort had a 
workable knowledge as regards to the competencies 
and skills required to tackle the collaborative design 
brief we proceeded to match students with community 
groups with whom they could share and develop their 
proposals or co-define new ones based on community 
feedback/collaboration.  The student proposals 
focused on the following themes:
• 
• 
Re-use and recycle (plastic bags, Tetrapacks)
Local and seasonal food (food growing, access to 
local and seasonal food, packaging)
•  Water saving services
• 
• 
Compost delivery services
Electric car management services
4.  WORKING WITH RESIDENTS – MATCHMAKING 
STUDENTS AND RESIDENT NEEDS
One of the aims of our project was for students to 
co-create services that could be implemented by the 
residents.  Also for student designers to work with 
residents to improve services already implemented 
by them.  We arranged for the Camden Sustainability 
Team and Green Zone residents interested/active in 
these thematic areas to attend student presentations 
of their proposals.  Each student introduced their 
proposal to the stakeholder group and received 
feedback.  The students needed to understand that 
their proposals were only to be used as a starting 
point for discussion, as a boundary object11, to illustrate 
the sort of approaches that students would ideally 
like or seek to develop in collaboration with residents 
to facilitate achievement of the residents’ sustainable 
actions i.e. to attract residents with real problems or 
needs on similar themes to collaborate with students 
to address them.  These projects were loaded on a 
website, so we could match student interest with 
resident interest and needs.  See:  
http://desisgreencamden.jimdo.com/.
4.1. Matchmaking
How to find the right community for the right student 
was not obvious to us.  Project staff circulated the 
web address for the matchmaking blog to the Camden 
Council Sustainability Team for circulation to Green 
Zone residents.  The aim was to find resident groups
