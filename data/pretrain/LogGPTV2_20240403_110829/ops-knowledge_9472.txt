User: When i try to run a simple deploy this message error comes to me:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/universal-darwin13/rbconfig.rb:212: warning: Insecure world writable dir /usr/local/bin in PATH, mode 040777
Usage: fab mapfile [options]
Please specify a valid map file.
I am not familiar with fabric. I am Mac os environment ...
Assistant: Looks like you have your /usr/local/bin directory set to 777 or world writable. This is very bad, lock it down to 755 and owned by root at the very least.
