When attempting to run a simple deployment, I encountered the following error message:

```
/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/universal-darwin13/rbconfig.rb:212: warning: Insecure world writable dir /usr/local/bin in PATH, mode 040777
Usage: fab mapfile [options]
Please specify a valid map file.
```

I am not very familiar with Fabric and I am working in a macOS environment.

It appears that your `/usr/local/bin` directory is set to `777`, which means it is world-writable. This is a security risk. To resolve this issue, you should change the permissions of the directory to at least `755` and ensure it is owned by the root user. 

You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin
sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin
```

This will help secure your system and may resolve the warning you are seeing.
