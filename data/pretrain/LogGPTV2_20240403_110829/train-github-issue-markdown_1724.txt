 **Issue Type:** Feature Idea  
**Component Name:** module_utils/ec2.py  
**Ansible Version:** devel  
**Summary:**  
I know there is this module:
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/sts_assume_role_module.html
But having this in the ec2.py module utility seems like a much better way to
go as it is a lot of boiler plate to have to add sts_assume_role to every
playbook that assumes roles. We only assume roles at our company to do
anything with AWS so it is painful for us. It would be pretty trivial for me
to add this to ec2.py.
