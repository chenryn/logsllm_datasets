**Issue Type:** Feature Request  
**Component Name:** module_utils/ec2.py  
**Ansible Version:** Development Branch  
**Summary:**

Currently, the `sts_assume_role` functionality is provided by a dedicated module, as documented here: [STS Assume Role Module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/sts_assume_role_module.html). However, integrating this feature directly into the `ec2.py` module utility would be more efficient and user-friendly. The current approach requires adding `sts_assume_role` to every playbook that needs to assume roles, which introduces a significant amount of boilerplate code.

In our company, we use role assumption for all AWS interactions, making the repetitive inclusion of `sts_assume_role` in each playbook cumbersome. Incorporating this functionality into `ec2.py` would streamline our workflow and reduce redundancy. I believe this enhancement could be implemented with relative ease, and I am willing to contribute to this effort.
