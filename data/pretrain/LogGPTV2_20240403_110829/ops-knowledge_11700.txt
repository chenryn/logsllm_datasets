User: I wrote an application that stores several things in the registry. When I first started, I added them to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, but kept getting permission errors writing to the. So, it was suggested that I use HKEY_CURRENT_USER, that worked until I realized that I am not able to access them from another account. How can I write to the registry but allow all accounts to access read and write to it?
I used the Python module _winreg.
Assistant: One other possibility would be changing the security on your HKLM keys to R/W for anyone.  Although the idea that this is somehow security against modification seems a bit of a stretch.
Regedt32 has the ability to set the keys, so the underlying API must have it too.
All that said, this is a screwed up way to run an application and shows a sever lack of understanding of security and security models.  (In other words, typical windows development.)
How did I get so cynical.....
