User: whats is the current best practice for installing multiple versions of python on snow leopard?

have setup python 2.7.1 via Homebrew, very easy process, all great.
but now I need to setup python 2.5 to develop an appengine project..  Initially created a new virtualenv against system python2.5 .. but finding I have all kinds of PATH issues. Seems at this point it would be better not to use Homebrew and go with a more standard setup?

any thoughts ?
Assistant: Snow leopard already contains python 2.5 and python 2.6, no issues there.
If you require obscure modifications to the python installations, just compile your own, and put it in some place where it won't conflict with the system python. (I suggest /opt/your-pythonx.y).
As an aside, check: "man python" on mac to see how to use the 32-bit, or 64-bit options if that turns out to be neccessary. (Sometimes it is for c modules)
