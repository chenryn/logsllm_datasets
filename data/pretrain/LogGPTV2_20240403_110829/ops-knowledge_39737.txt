User: I have OpenStack UI running. I made some changes in the local-setting.py file and restarted the Horizon service using service httpd restart and try to hit OpenStack UI but it returns an error: "HTTP 400 Bad request".
When I revert back all changes, restart the service and try again the error is still there.
Please help me !!
Assistant: if you are running on Horizon on Apache then you need to check apache logs to identify issue. Horizon logs will not contains anything if apache was not able to execute WSGI script for Horizon.
