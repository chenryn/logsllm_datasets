I have OpenStack Horizon (UI) running. After making some changes to the `local_settings.py` file, I restarted the Horizon service using the command `service httpd restart`. However, when I try to access the OpenStack UI, I receive an "HTTP 400 Bad Request" error.

Interestingly, even after reverting all the changes, restarting the service, and trying again, the error persists.

Could you please help me resolve this issue?

**Response:**

If you are running Horizon on Apache, you should check the Apache logs to identify the problem. The Horizon logs may not contain any relevant information if Apache was unable to execute the WSGI script for Horizon.
