Challenge Waypoint: Import a Google Font has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:42.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/42.0`.  
Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
When each Waypoint loads, the current code appears to be running twice. When I
edit the code, it refreshes and displays properly. This has happened on every
Waypoint for me so far (I just started from the very beginning today).
