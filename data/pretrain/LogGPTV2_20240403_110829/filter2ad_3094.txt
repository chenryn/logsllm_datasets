Overview 
•  They allow to remotely control a router’s routing 
table without having to control the router itself. 
•  A single compromised router inside an AS can 
compromise the routing of the whole AS. 
•  Potentially every OSPF implementation is 
vulnerable. 
•  The attacks were verified against Cisco’s IOS. 
2 
Who is vulnerable? 
•  Potentially all commercial routers are 
vulnerable! 
•  The vulnerabilities were found in the spec 
of the OSPF protocol [RFC 2328]. 
•  The attacks have been verified against 
Cisco IOS 15.0(1)M. 
•  IOS’s latest stable release

LSAs 
•  Each LSA is advertised periodically 
•  Sequence number 
•  To differentiate between instances of the same LSA 
•  Age 
•  To allow a specific instance of an LSA to expire

The Attacker 
•  Location: Inside the AS 
•  Controls a single router 
•  Arbitrary location 
•  Goal: 
•  Persistent control over the routing tables of 
other routers in the AS 
OSPF Security Strengths 
•  Per-link authentication 
•  Every link has its own shared secret 
•  Every LSA is flooded throughout the AS 
•  The “fight back” mechanism 
10 
Known Attacks 
•  Falsify LSAs of: 
•  The attacker’s router 
•  Very limited 
•  other routers 
•  Known examples: Seq++, MaxSeq,… 
•  Trigger immediate fight back 
•  A non-persistent attack 
•  phantom routers 
•  Does not have an affect on the routing table 
11 
Known Attacks 
•  In summary, 
other routers. 
•  The common conception is that even if the attacker is 
an insider it can not persistently falsify the LSA of a 
router it does not control. 
•  Hence, it can not significantly poison the routing tables of

The New Attacks 
•  Attack #1 – Remote False Adjacency 
•  Make a remote router include a non-existing 
link in its LSA 
•  Attack #2 – Disguised LSA 
•  Falsify the entire LSA of remote router 
13 
Attack #2 – Disguised LSA 
•  The vulnerability 
•  Two different instances of an LSA are considered 
identical if they have the same [RFC 2328 Sec. 13.1]: 
•  Sequence number 
•  Checksum 
•  Age (+/- 15 minutes) 
•  The actual payload of the LSAs are not considered! 
•  The attack 
•  Advertise a false LSA having the same values for 
these three fields as a valid LSA. 
•  The benefit: no fight back is triggered since the victim views 
the false LSA as a duplicate of the LSA it just advertised. 
14 
Attack #2 – Disguised LSA (cont.) 
•  The attack (cont.) 
•  But, there is a problem: all other routers in the 
AS will also consider the false LSA as a 
duplicate 
•  therefore, they will not install it in their LSA DB. 
•  Solution: Disguise the LSA to the next valid 
instance of the LSA 
•  While at the same time the victim originate this 
next valid instance 
•  The trigger is done using the fight-back mechanism 
15 
Application 
•  The attacker floods consecutively the 
trigger and  then the disguised LSA. 
The trigger LSA is 
sent followed by the 
disguised LSA.  
-  Trigger LSA 
-  Disguised LSA 
-  Fight back LSA 
The fight back 
LSA is rejected as 
a duplicate. 
The disguised 
LSA is rejected as 
a duplicate. 
victim 
Fight back is now 
triggered 
16 
How the disguised LSA can be crafted? 
•  Age: this is the easiest one.  
•  The disguised LSA will be advertised within 15 minutes of the 
valid (fight back) LSA. 
•  Sequence: the value is always incremented by one. 
•  The disguised LSA will have the sequence of the trigger LSA 
plus 1. 
•  Checksum: this is the hardest feat, but not that hard. 
•  The content of the next valid LSA is deterministic and 
predictable, hence the checksum is also predictable. 
•  A dummy Link entry in added to the payload of the LSA. 
•  The value of this entry is calculated such that the entire LSA will 
have the desired checksum. 
•  This can be done since a checksum is a 16-bit result of a linear 
calculation on the LSA octets. 
17 
Attack Effectiveness 
•  We simulated the attack on real ISP 
topologies 
•  Inferred by the RocketFuel project 
•  We measured for every pair of attacker-
victim locations what is the percentage of 
poisoned routers.

Conclusions 
•  Up until now the common conception was 
that even if the attacker is an insider it can 
not persistently poison the routing table of 
a router it does not control. 
•  The new attacks shatter this misconception. 
•  Using these attacks one can control the 
entire routing domain from a single 
router.

In Summary … 
Using these attacks one can control the 
entire routing domain from a single 
router.
