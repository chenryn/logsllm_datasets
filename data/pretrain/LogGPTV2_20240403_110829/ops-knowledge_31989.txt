User: I am trying to debug a process that hangs, the output of  strace for the process id has last line :
recvfrom(9,  <detached ...>
From this what I understand that the process is waiting on the socket.
But I don't know which or what kind of socket is this. How can I discover more about this ? does the file descriptor 9 will give me more information ? How can I use this file discover to know more about what it is waiting for ? 
its a python process, running in linux.
Assistant: Look earlier in the strace output for when the file descriptor was returned from open() (or perhaps socket()), there you'll see the additional arguments used in the call.
