User: I would like to find out if there is a Pythonxy.com equivalent for Linux/Mac OS X yet?
any kind of pointers would be helpful?
Thanks and best regards,
Vishal Sapre
Assistant: For linux, you don't need something like PythonXY, because it's already very easy to install packages with your package manager. Things are actually a lot better integrated under linux than under windows.
What you need to do is pick a good linux distribution, and install the packages you like with the package manager (apt, dnf, pacman...)
