**Previous behavior**  
Using RC4, the following would work...  
`*ngIf="(searchResults | async)?.length > 0"`  
or  
`*ngIf="(searchResults | async)?.length == 0"`
**Current behavior**  
RC5 throws  
`TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null`
This syntax does work in RC5  
`*ngIf="((searchResults | async) || []).length > 0"`  
and  
`*ngIf="((searchResults | async) || {}).length == 0"`
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The original RC4 behavior seems more intuitive, especially when checking
`.length == 0` since it did not evaluate until the observable returned.
