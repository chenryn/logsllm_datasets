## Abstract
The online sale of counterfeit or unauthorized pharmaceuticals fuels a robust underground advertising industry, including email spam, black hat search engine optimization, and forum abuse. While these activities are clearly economically motivated, the underlying business structure remains poorly understood due to its clandestine nature. In this paper, we leverage a rare opportunity to examine three such organizations—GlavMed, SpamIt, and RX-Promotion—from the inside. Using four years of raw transaction logs covering over $170 million in sales, we provide an in-depth empirical analysis of global consumer demand, the critical role of independent third-party advertisers, and a detailed cost accounting of the overall business model.

## Introduction
Advertising is a major driver of both legitimate and underground economies on the Internet. Spam, search engine abuse, forum spam, and social spam, along with the botnets and fast-flux networks that support them, serve as low-cost advertising platforms. Research into the economic structure of these criminal enterprises aims to understand their scope and drivers, and to prioritize interventions. However, the lack of "ground truth" data has limited the effectiveness of such research. This paper provides a unique counterpoint by analyzing extensive, real-world data from the GlavMed, SpamIt, and RX-Promotion pharmaceutical affiliate programs. By examining hundreds of thousands of orders totaling over US$170M, we offer comprehensive insights into three key aspects of underground advertising:

- **Customers:** Detailed analysis of consumer demand for internet-advertised counterfeit pharmaceuticals, including demographics, product selection, reorder rates, and market saturation.
- **Advertisers:** Quantitative assessment of the role of third-party affiliate advertisers, their labor market dynamics, revenue generation, and commission income distribution.
- **Sponsors:** Empirical revenue and cost models, including direct and indirect costs, and insights into the most significant overheads for program operators.

This paper does not introduce new artifacts or inference techniques but instead leverages actual data sets to provide unique and significant results, with implications for addressing internet abuse.

## Background
Abusive internet advertising has existed almost as long as the internet itself. Rogue advertisers use various vectors, including email spam, search engine manipulation, and forum and blog spam, to attract customers. Due to regulatory pressure, few legitimate merchants engage in these tactics, leading to a close association between rogue advertising and illicit products. For example, Symantec estimated that 80% of all email spam promotes "prescription-free" pharmaceuticals.

Over the past decade, the structure of this activity has evolved, with the rise of affiliate programs (or "partnerkas") separating the roles of advertisers and sponsors. Sponsors handle website design, payment processing, customer service, and fulfillment, while affiliates are paid commissions to drive traffic. This model offers advantages such as focus and mobility for advertisers, and reduced risk and innovation outsourcing for sponsors.

Online pharmaceutical sales represent one of the largest and oldest affiliate markets, supporting tens of programs, thousands of advertisers, and hundreds of thousands of customers. Despite recent studies, the dynamics and cost structures of this business remain poorly understood. For instance, estimates of monthly order volumes vary widely, from 86,000 to over 640,000.

In this paper, we focus on three pharmaceutical affiliate programs: GlavMed, SpamIt, and RX-Promotion. These organizations have been in operation for five years or more, representing many storefront brands and accounting for over a third of all spam email messages.

## Authenticity and Ethics
Our use of "found data" raises concerns about authenticity and ethics.

### Authenticity
The data sets were released due to enmity between the owners of GlavMed and RX-Promotion, resulting in the hacking and leaking of information. We obtained complete transactional data for GlavMed and SpamIt covering four years, and a year of data for RX-Promotion, along with metadata including chat logs and financial records.

While we cannot establish absolute provenance, several factors support the authenticity of the data:
- **Size and Detail:** The data sets are large and detailed, making forgery costly.
- **Internal and Cross-Consistency:** Complex schemas and direct concordances between different elements suggest accuracy.
- **Verification:** Our own orders, placed during the period covered by the data, are accurately recorded.

Given the strong concordances and lack of evidence for forgery, we assume the data sets are authentic and accurate.

### Ethics
The ethical use of data gathered via potentially illegal means is a complex issue. We justify our use by considering the harm:
- **Data Availability:** The data is already broadly available, and its existence and content have been publicly documented.
- **Harm Management:** We take steps to minimize any potential harm, such as avoiding the disclosure of sensitive personal information.

By using this data, we aim to provide valuable insights into the underground economy and inform strategies to combat internet abuse.
