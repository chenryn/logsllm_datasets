Abstract
Researchers have observed the increasing commoditiza-
tion of cybercrime, that is, the offering of capabilities,
services, and resources as commodities by specialized
suppliers in the underground economy. Commoditiza-
tion enables outsourcing, thus lowering entry barriers for
aspiring criminals, and potentially driving further growth
in cybercrime. While there is evidence in the literature
of speciﬁc examples of cybercrime commoditization, the
overall phenomenon is much less understood. Which
parts of cybercrime value chains are successfully com-
moditized, and which are not? What kind of revenue
do criminal business-to-business (B2B) services gener-
ate and how fast are they growing?
We use longitudinal data from eight online anonymous
marketplaces over six years, from the original Silk Road
to AlphaBay, and track the evolution of commoditiza-
tion on these markets. We develop a conceptual model of
the value chain components for dominant criminal busi-
ness models. We then identify the market supply for
these components over time. We ﬁnd evidence of com-
moditization in most components, but the outsourcing
options are highly restricted and transaction volume is
often modest. Cash-out services feature the most listings
and generate the largest revenue. Consistent with be-
havior observed in the context of narcotic sales, we also
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant amount of revenue in retail cybercrime,
i.e., business-to-consumer (B2C) rather than business-
to-business. We conservatively estimate the overall rev-
enue for cybercrime commodities on online anonymous
markets to be at least US $15M between 2011-2017.
While there is growth, commoditization is a spottier phe-
nomenon than previously assumed.

Introduction
Many scientiﬁc studies and industry reports have ob-
served the emergence of cybercrime-as-a-service mod-
els, also referred to as the “commoditization of cyber-
crime.” The idea is that specialized suppliers in the
underground economy cater to criminal entrepreneurs
in need of certain capabilities, services, and resources
[23, 33, 39, 42]. Commoditization allows these en-
trepreneurs to substitute specialized technical knowledge
with “knowing what to buy” - that is, outsourcing parts
of the criminal value chain. The impact of this trend
could be dramatic: Commoditization substantially low-
ers entry barriers for criminals, which is hypothesized to
accelerate the growth of cybercrime. Prior work found
strong evidence for speciﬁc cases of commoditization:
booters offering DDoS services [29], suppliers in “pay-
per-install” markets distributing malware [13], and ex-
ploit kit developers supplying “drive-by” browser com-
promises [22]. The overall pattern is much less clear,
however, as not all cybercrime components are equally
amenable to outsourcing [21].
This paper answers two core questions: Which parts
of cybercrime value chains are successfully commodi-
tized and which are not? What kind of revenue do these
criminal business-to-business services generate and how
fast are they growing? Addressing these questions re-
quires that we properly deﬁne and scope the concept of
commoditization. To do so, we turn to transaction cost
economics (TCE). We argue that the characteristics of
commodities are highly congruent with the characteris-
tics of online anonymous marketplaces. More precisely,
the one-shot, anonymous purchases these markets sup-
port require suppliers to offer highly commoditized of-
ferings. Conversely, if cybercrime offerings can be com-
moditized, online anonymous markets should be a highly
attractive place to sell them. Indeed, these platforms can
reach a large audience and provide risk management ser-
vices for criminals, e.g., by protecting their anonymity,
and featuring reputation systems to root out fraudulent
sales and shield sellers from risky interactions with buy-
ers.
While data from online anonymous marketplaces pro-
vides a unique opportunity to track the evolution of

commoditization, we are not arguing that these market-
places provide a complete picture. They do not have a
monopoly, of course. In fact, certain types of commodi-
tized offerings are not suited for trading on these market-
places, e.g., afﬁliate programs, subscription-based offer-
ings, or services requiring a rich search interface may be
better served by alternative distribution channels [26,48].
Yet, on balance, the congruence of commoditized forms
of cybercrime and online anonymous markets means that
the evolution of commodizitation should be clearly ob-
servable on those markets.
We analyze longitudinal data on the offerings and
transactions from eight online anonymous marketplaces,
collected between 2011 and 2017. We ﬁrst present a con-
ceptual model of the value chain components in domi-
nant criminal business models, and develop a classiﬁer
to map cybercrime-related listings across all markets to
these components. This allows us to track trends in ven-
dors, offerings and transaction volumes. We then discuss
the type of offerings to assess to what extent each com-
ponent can be outsourced - i.e., to what extent it is suc-
cessfully commoditized. In short, we make the following
contributions:
• We present the ﬁrst comprehensive empirical study
of the commoditization of cybercrime on online
anonymous markets. We analyze 44,000 listings
and over 564,000 transactions across eight market-
places. We draw on data from prior work [40] and
newly collected data on AlphaBay.
• We ﬁnd commoditized business-to-business offer-
ings for most value chain components, though many
of them are niche products with only modest trans-
action volumes. Cash-out services contain the most
listings and generate the largest revenue. We esti-
mate the lower bound of overall B2B revenue to be
around $2 million in 2016 and over $8 million for
the whole period.
• We also uncover a surprising amount of revenue
in retail cybercrime – that is, business-to-consumer
sales rather than business-to-business, similar to the
patterns observed for drug sales. The lower-bound
estimate for 2016 is over $1 million and nearly $7
million for the whole period.
• We demonstrate that commoditization is a more
spotty phenomenon than previously assumed. The
lack of strong growth in transactions suggests that
bottlenecks remain in outsourcing critical parts of
criminal value chains.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 deﬁnes transaction cost economics, and discusses
how the concept applies to cybercrime commoditization.

tion 8 connects our work to earlier contributions. Sec-
tion 9 concludes.
2 Commoditization and anonymous mar-
ketplaces
With outsourcing, entrepreneurs can decide to either
“make” or “buy” each component of the value chain.
Transaction cost economics (TCE) is a mature economic
theory that seeks to explain under what conditions eco-
nomic activity is organized in markets (buy) and when
it is vertically integrated (make) – i.e., the entrepreneur
develops the component himself or brings someone with
that capability into the enterprise. Here, we apply TCE
to the context of cybercrime to predict if and when out-
sourcing takes place.
Williamson [47] distinguishes several asset character-
istics that determine if and how outsourcing will occur,
as shown in Figure 1. A, B, and C are various forms of
outsourcing and D is vertical integration. Factors such
as asset speciﬁcity, frequency and uncertainty separate
the underlying transactions [45]. k is a measure of as-
set speciﬁcity, referring to the degree to which a product
or service is speciﬁc to e.g., a vendor, location, control
over resources, etc. A key characteristic of commodities
is that they are “fungible”, meaning that different offer-
ings of it are mutually interchangeable (k = 0) – i.e., a
booter is a booter [29, 31] – and subject to vendor com-
petition [18]. In commodity markets, buyers can easily
turn to other suppliers, and suppliers can sell to other
buyers, reducing possible hazards. The more speciﬁc an
asset is (k > 0), the more investments are specialized to
a particular transaction.
The second factor, s, refers to contractual safeguards.
Transactions where investments are exposed to unre-
lieved contractual hazards (s = 0) will not be traded pub-

 licly (i.e., anonymous online marketplaces such as Silk
Road or AlphaBay are a poor ﬁt), but on smaller, “invite-
only” markets where trust relations are forged among
specialized insiders, anonymity is not absolute, and es-
crow services are less prominent [36]. When s > 0, con-
tracts with transaction-speciﬁc safeguards are in place.
Commodities are sold via unassisted markets (A).
These markets incentivize sellers to reduce asset speci-
ﬁcity as much as possible, hence commoditizing the of-
fering. The efﬁciency gains also work in the other di-
rection: those who offer goods or services that can be
commoditized would use these markets to sell them and
beneﬁt from the wide reach and high frequency of trans-
actions, without being exposed to risky direct interaction
and coordination with buyers.
In terms of TCE, online anonymous marketplaces are
unassisted markets – i.e., they are the place to go for
commoditized cybercrime. Anonymous markets reduce
uncertainty risks through escrow mechanisms, review
systems and strict rules enforced by a market adminis-
trator [15,40]. For transactions where k = 0, “no speciﬁc
assets are involved and the parties are essentially face-
less” [46, p. 20], which is precisely the case for anony-
mous markets. Complex components such as highly cus-
tomized malware are more likely to be self-supplied or
delivered under special contracts, while frequently used,
standardized components, like DDoS-services, would be
supplied more efﬁciently by the unassisted market. TCE
tells us that the organization of criminal activities will
be guided primarily by the relative costs of completing
illegal transactions within the market [19, p. 28].
Similar to the prominent drugs-trade on anonymous
online markets, we expect two type of commodities on
these markets: business-to-business (B2B), e.g., whole-
sale quantities of credit card details, and business-to-
consumer (B2C), e.g., a handful of Netﬂix accounts. We
are primarily interested in B2B, as that is the form of
commoditization that is the most worrying and specu-
lated to cause a massive growth in cybercrime, though
we will also report the main ﬁndings for B2C. To assess
the degree to which B2B services are commoditized, the
next section develops a framework to identify the differ-
ent value chains where there is demand for commodi-
tized cybercrime.
3 Demand for cybercrime outsourcing
To empirically assess the commoditization of cyber-
crime, we ﬁrst need to establish what capabilities, ser-
vices and resources criminal entrepreneurs actually need.
This provides us with a framework against which to eval-
uate where commodities are available to meet this de-
mand and where they are not – as measured through
listings on anonymous marketplaces. Of course, en-
trepreneurs might demand an endless variety of goods
and services. For this reason, we use as our starting point
the dominant criminal business models that were identi-
ﬁed in prior work. We look at the value chain underlying
each business model and synthesize them in a common
set of components that entrepreneurs might want to out-
source. Our point of departure is Thomas et al. [42]’s
inventory of criminal business models. We update and
extend this set with models discussed in related research.
Table 1 shows this updated overview.
First, we look into the value chain behind spamvertis-
ing, which is driven by three resources: a) advertisement
distribution b) hosting and click support and c) realiza-
tion and cash-out [34, 42].
Second, extortion schemes, for instance ransomware
or fake anti-virus [17] have a value chain that consists
of four distinctive resources: a) development of malware
b) distribution, by either exploits or (spear)phishing e-
mails, c) take-over and “customer service” and d) cash-
out [30, 42].
Third, click fraud is supported by four similar, gen-
eral resources: a) development of a website, malware
or a JavaScript, b) distribution through botnets, c) take-
over by either malware or JavaScript and d) cash-out
[32, 42].
Fourth, the criminal business model in social engi-
neering scams, such as tech support scams [35], or one-
click fraud [16] leans on: a) (optional) development of
malware or a malicious app, b) distribution by phish-
ing e-mail or website, or through social engineering, c)
take-over and setting-up “customer service,” and d) cash-
out [35, 42]. The boundary between extortion and social
engineering scams is fuzzy. Both could well be cate-
gorized in the same family. For now, we take the view
that extortion (e.g., ransomware) requires development
of malware, where social engineering scams do not nec-
essarily rely on anything being installed on the victim’s
machine (e.g., one-click frauds [16]).
Fifth, cybercriminal fraud schemes, e.g. those enabled
by ﬁnancial malware, build on four general, main re-
sources: a) development and b) distribution of malware
or a malicious app, c) take-over, for instance by using
web-injects or a RAT,1 and d) cash-out [42, 44].
Sixth, cryptocurrency mining relies on near-similar re-
sources as click fraud: a) the development of malware or
JavaScript, b) distribution of malware by botnets or the
injection of a JavaScript in a compromised websites, c)
the take-over, i.e. mining, and d) cash-out [27, 42].
Seventh, the criminal business model that proﬁts from
selling stolen credit card details makes use of: a) devel-
opment of a phishing website, malware or a malicious
