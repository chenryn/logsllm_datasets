## Abstract
Researchers have observed the increasing commoditization of cybercrime, where specialized suppliers in the underground economy offer capabilities, services, and resources as commodities. This commoditization lowers entry barriers for aspiring criminals and potentially drives further growth in cybercrime. While there is evidence of specific examples of cybercrime commoditization, the overall phenomenon is less understood. This study uses longitudinal data from eight online anonymous marketplaces over six years to track the evolution of commoditization. We develop a conceptual model of the value chain components for dominant criminal business models and identify the market supply for these components over time. Our findings show that most components are commoditized, but outsourcing options are limited and transaction volumes are often modest. Cash-out services feature the most listings and generate the largest revenue. We also find significant revenue in retail cybercrime (B2C) rather than B2B. We conservatively estimate the overall revenue for cybercrime commodities on online anonymous markets to be at least US $15M between 2011-2017. While there is growth, commoditization is a more fragmented phenomenon than previously assumed.

## 1. Introduction
Many scientific studies and industry reports have observed the emergence of cybercrime-as-a-service models, also known as the "commoditization of cybercrime." Specialized suppliers in the underground economy cater to criminal entrepreneurs who need certain capabilities, services, and resources. Commoditization allows these entrepreneurs to outsource parts of the criminal value chain, substituting specialized technical knowledge with "knowing what to buy." This trend could dramatically lower entry barriers for criminals, potentially accelerating the growth of cybercrime. Prior work has found strong evidence for specific cases of commoditization, such as booters offering DDoS services, suppliers in "pay-per-install" markets distributing malware, and exploit kit developers supplying "drive-by" browser compromises. However, the overall pattern is less clear, as not all cybercrime components are equally amenable to outsourcing.

This paper addresses two core questions:
1. Which parts of cybercrime value chains are successfully commoditized, and which are not?
2. What kind of revenue do these criminal business-to-business (B2B) services generate, and how fast are they growing?

To answer these questions, we use transaction cost economics (TCE) to define and scope the concept of commoditization. TCE suggests that the characteristics of commodities align well with the characteristics of online anonymous marketplaces, which support one-shot, anonymous purchases. These platforms can reach a large audience and provide risk management services for criminals, such as protecting their anonymity and featuring reputation systems to root out fraudulent sales.

While data from online anonymous marketplaces provides a unique opportunity to track the evolution of commoditization, these marketplaces do not provide a complete picture. Certain types of commoditized offerings may be better served by alternative distribution channels, such as affiliate programs or subscription-based offerings. Nevertheless, the congruence of commoditized forms of cybercrime and online anonymous markets means that the evolution of commoditization should be clearly observable on these markets.

We analyze longitudinal data on the offerings and transactions from eight online anonymous marketplaces, collected between 2011 and 2017. We present a conceptual model of the value chain components in dominant criminal business models and develop a classifier to map cybercrime-related listings across all markets to these components. This allows us to track trends in vendors, offerings, and transaction volumes. We then discuss the type of offerings to assess the extent to which each component can be outsourced—i.e., to what extent it is successfully commoditized.

Our contributions include:
- The first comprehensive empirical study of the commoditization of cybercrime on online anonymous markets, analyzing 44,000 listings and over 564,000 transactions across eight marketplaces.
- Evidence of commoditized B2B offerings for most value chain components, though many are niche products with modest transaction volumes. Cash-out services contain the most listings and generate the largest revenue. We estimate the lower bound of overall B2B revenue to be around $2 million in 2016 and over $8 million for the whole period.
- A surprising amount of revenue in retail cybercrime (B2C), similar to the patterns observed for drug sales. The lower-bound estimate for 2016 is over $1 million and nearly $7 million for the whole period.
- Demonstration that commoditization is a more fragmented phenomenon than previously assumed, with a lack of strong growth in transactions suggesting that bottlenecks remain in outsourcing critical parts of criminal value chains.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 defines transaction cost economics and discusses how the concept applies to cybercrime commoditization. Section 3 describes the demand for cybercrime outsourcing. Section 4 presents our measurement methodology. Section 5 lays down our classification analysis, and Section 6 identifies the best-selling clusters of cybercrime components. Section 7 discusses our findings, and Section 8 connects our work to earlier contributions. Section 9 concludes.

## 2. Commoditization and Anonymous Marketplaces
Outsourcing allows entrepreneurs to decide whether to "make" or "buy" each component of the value chain. Transaction cost economics (TCE) is a mature economic theory that explains under what conditions economic activity is organized in markets (buy) and when it is vertically integrated (make). We apply TCE to the context of cybercrime to predict if and when outsourcing takes place.

Williamson distinguishes several asset characteristics that determine if and how outsourcing will occur, as shown in Figure 1. Factors such as asset specificity, frequency, and uncertainty separate the underlying transactions. Commodity markets are characterized by fungibility, meaning that different offerings are mutually interchangeable, and subject to vendor competition. In commodity markets, buyers can easily turn to other suppliers, and suppliers can sell to other buyers, reducing possible hazards. The more specific an asset is, the more investments are specialized to a particular transaction.

In terms of TCE, online anonymous marketplaces are unassisted markets—the place to go for commoditized cybercrime. These markets reduce uncertainty risks through escrow mechanisms, review systems, and strict rules enforced by a market administrator. For transactions with no specific assets involved, anonymous markets are ideal. Complex components, such as highly customized malware, are more likely to be self-supplied or delivered under special contracts, while frequently used, standardized components, like DDoS services, would be supplied more efficiently by the unassisted market.

Similar to the prominent drugs trade on anonymous online markets, we expect two types of commodities: business-to-business (B2B), such as wholesale quantities of credit card details, and business-to-consumer (B2C), such as a handful of Netflix accounts. We are primarily interested in B2B, as it is the form of commoditization speculated to cause a massive growth in cybercrime, though we will also report the main findings for B2C. To assess the degree to which B2B services are commoditized, the next section develops a framework to identify the different value chains where there is demand for commoditized cybercrime.

## 3. Demand for Cybercrime Outsourcing
To empirically assess the commoditization of cybercrime, we first need to establish what capabilities, services, and resources criminal entrepreneurs actually need. This provides a framework against which to evaluate where commodities are available to meet this demand and where they are not, as measured through listings on anonymous marketplaces. We use the dominant criminal business models identified in prior work as our starting point. Table 1 shows an updated overview of these models.

1. **Spamvertising:** Driven by three resources: advertisement distribution, hosting and click support, and realization and cash-out.
2. **Extortion Schemes (e.g., ransomware, fake anti-virus):** Consist of four distinctive resources: development of malware, distribution, take-over and "customer service," and cash-out.
3. **Click Fraud:** Supported by four similar resources: development of a website, malware, or JavaScript, distribution through botnets, take-over by malware or JavaScript, and cash-out.
4. **Social Engineering Scams (e.g., tech support scams, one-click fraud):** Leans on optional development of malware or a malicious app, distribution by phishing email or website, take-over and setting up "customer service," and cash-out.
5. **Cybercriminal Fraud Schemes (e.g., financial malware):** Build on four general resources: development and distribution of malware or a malicious app, take-over, and cash-out.
6. **Cryptocurrency Mining:** Relies on near-similar resources as click fraud: development of malware or JavaScript, distribution by botnets or injection into compromised websites, mining, and cash-out.
7. **Selling Stolen Credit Card Details:** Uses development of a phishing website, malware, or a malicious app, distribution, take-over, and cash-out.

These business models provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the demand for commoditized cybercrime and the potential for outsourcing in the underground economy.
