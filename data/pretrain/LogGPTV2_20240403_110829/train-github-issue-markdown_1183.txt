### Problem description
If there is already an issue concerning this topic, feel free to close.
When inserting text into the text input component, the IE11 and Edge show a
(very large) reset X. Other browsers don't show the x. The size of the x is
also not appropriate to the rest of the text(input). It just looks weird.
### IE 11
