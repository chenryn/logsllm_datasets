I am currently using Atom on Arch Linux and have discovered three configuration directories for Atom in my home directory:

1. `.atom`
2. `.config/Atom`
3. `.config/Atom-Shell`

To improve the organization and adhere to Linux conventions, I would like to make the following changes:

1. Move the `.atom` directory to `.config`.
2. Consolidate all Atom-related configurations into a single directory within `.config`.
3. Use lowercase letters for the directory name, as is customary in Linux.

This will result in a more streamlined and conventional directory structure.
