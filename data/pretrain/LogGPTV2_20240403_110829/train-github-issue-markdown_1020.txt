Hi,  
a really good way to improve test performance would be to add the flag/option
to run async tests in parallel. Currently this is not possible but it would
increase test speed of independent (well-written) tests A LOT.  
I understand that this might break some existing tests so I would either go
with the `--unstable` flag or add a new option like `--parallel`.
What do you think about this?
