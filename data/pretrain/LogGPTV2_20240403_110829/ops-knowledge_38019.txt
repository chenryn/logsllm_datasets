Assistant: To set the security and performance optimization options of a web server (such as Nginx), you can follow the steps below: 1. Disable unnecessary modules and functions to reduce the attack surface. It can be achieved by configuring options when compiling Nginx. 2. Enable the SSL/TLS protocol to protect the security of data transmission. You can use a tool like Let's Encrypt to get a free SSL/TLS certificate. 3. Configure the firewall to restrict access to the web server. Rules can be set using iptables or a firewall service. 4. Regularly update software and patches to fix potential vulnerabilities. Automatic updates should be used to ensure timely updates. 5. Optimize Nginx configuration to improve performance. It can be achieved by adjusting the size of the connection pool, caching configuration, and adjusting the worker process. 6. Use caching to reduce server load. Cache modules such as proxy_cache and fastcgi_cache can be used in Nginx. 7. Configure HTTP header files to improve security. For example, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) can be enabled to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. 8. Configure logging and monitoring to better understand web server health and security events. You can use tools such as Logrotate to rotate log files. 9. For high-traffic web servers, load balancing can be used to distribute traffic. You can use Nginx's upstream module to achieve load balancing. The above suggestions are some general best practices, however, the actual situation may require appropriate adjustments and changes due to various reasons. If you are not sure how to optimize the security and performance of your web server, it is recommended to seek professional help.
