**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
https://github.com/buhichan/webpack_exports-is-undefined/tree/master
**What is the expected behavior?**
it should not generate main.js with reference error. This error does not
happen with webpack 5.22.
In
https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/javascript/JavascriptModulesPlugin.js,
the code is like
    renderMain(...){
         ...
         if(inlineModule){
              ...
              generate var __webpack_exports__ = {};
              ...
         }else{
              ...
         }
         if(someConfig){
              generate return __webpack_exports__;
         }
         ...
    }
Maybe `generate return __webpack_exports__` should be put into
if(inlineModule){ ... }
