TABLE VI: Summary of participant interview responses for attack scenarios. Scale points are normalized so that 1 represents the
most ‘positive’ point, i.e. the greatest change, and the highest value represents the most ‘negative’ i.e. no change. For example,
using Q4 relating to impact, 1 is the ‘signiﬁcant impact’ response. Dash indicates where no scale value existed, and representative
scale point is taken as scale response at the rounded mean, e.g. for impact, 1.4 will be ‘signiﬁcant impact’.
