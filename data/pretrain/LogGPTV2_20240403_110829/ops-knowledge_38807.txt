User: I have Python 2.6.1 which came on the Mac I have, but I'd recently downloaded and installed the disk image of 3.1.3 and I'd like to have it available in Terminal, how can I do this?  For instance when I do $ python -V in Terminal I get 2.6.1.
Thanks for any help.
Assistant: First, I'm not a Mac user, so I don't know a couple of specifics (default PATH, etc). 
Also, a bit of clarity - when you use the installer, it lets you customize the installation to install in a specific location - do you know where that is. If you didn't select a location, it defaults to /usr/local/bin.
From Terminal, try "python3".  If that fails, try "/usr/local/bin/python3".
Outside of that, wherever it's found, you'll want that in your path statement if it isn't there already.
It's not recommended that you "replace" the system python with python 3.x, as you'll definitely have problems.
