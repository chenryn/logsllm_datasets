### Cyber-Hijacking Airplanes: Truth or Fiction?

**Presenters:**
- **Dr. Phil Polstra** of Bloomsburg University
  - Hardware hacker and aviation expert with 12 current aviation ratings, including Commercial Pilot, Flight Instructor, Aircraft Mechanic, and Avionics Technician.
  - Thousands of hours of flight time and experience in aircraft development.
  - Access to airliner manuals and connections with current and former airline pilots.

- **Captain Polly** of University of [University Name]
  - Former airline pilot for a major US carrier.
  - Aviation professor and head of the college's simulator program.
  - Spouse of a current airline pilot.

**Why This Talk?**
- Many bold claims about the feasibility of cyber-hijacking have gained media attention.
- Most people lack the knowledge to evaluate these claims.
- Understanding the facts is crucial for assessing the safety and risks involved.

**What You Will Learn:**
- How common aircraft systems work, including:
  - ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast)
  - ADS-A (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Addressed)
  - ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System)
  - Transponders
  - Collision avoidance systems
  - GPS
  - Autopilots
  - Avionics buses and networks
  - Commonly discussed attacks

**Commonly Discussed Attacks:**
- Hacking into avionics via the entertainment network
- Hacking ADS-B
- Hacking engine systems
- Hacking ACARS

**Key Points to Consider:**
- Pilots cannot be overridden.
- All aircraft have mechanical backup instruments that are unhackable.
- Autopilot operations can be affected, but pilots will disconnect it if they notice any issues, and alerts will likely be triggered.

**Attacking Avionics Networks:**
- **Older Aircraft:**
  - Use ARINC 429 networks.
  - Not connected to useful systems.
  - Require specialized hardware.

- **Newer Aircraft:**
  - Use ARINC 664 (AFDX), a modified version of Ethernet.
  - Built on Ethernet but not directly compatible.
  - Features security measures and is never wireless.
  - Not connected to the entertainment system or in-flight Wi-Fi.

**ARINC 664 (AFDX):**
- Based on ARINC 629, first created by Boeing for the 777.
- Allows the use of common off-the-shelf (COTS) components.
- Uses redundant channels and timeslicing to avoid collisions and ensure determinism.
- Virtual Links (VL) are unidirectional, with one sender and one or more receivers.
- Bandwidth Allocation Gap (BAG) and jitter are managed to avoid collisions.

**Entertainment Systems:**
- Connected to output ports on GPS and FMS or through a Network Extension Device (NED).
- Never connected to ARINC 429/629/664.
- The avionics network is never wireless and not compatible with TCP/IP.

**Boeing 777 Confusion:**
- Boeing requested a special condition to connect the passenger information network to other networks using a NED.
- The FAA granted this condition with specific requirements for isolation and security.

**Network Extension Device (NED):**
- Acts as a gateway between ARINC 429/629/664 and IP.
- Each path must be programmed.
- The FMS does not receive input from the NED, preventing bogus commands.
- If compromised, the NED could impersonate another device.

**MH370:**
- A Boeing 777 using ARINC 629, which is harder to hack than ARINC 664.
- ARINC 629 is not Ethernet-based.

**Hacking In-flight Wireless:**
- Attacking ADS-B/ADS-A:
  - Can create phantom aircraft and fake weather reports.
  - No security in the protocol.
  - Could be jammed.
  - Not likely to affect TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System).

**Collision Avoidance:**
- **TIS-B (Traffic Information Service–Broadcast):**
  - Provided by ATC, requires a mode S transponder.
  - Available in some areas, not authoritative, and does not use ADS-B signals.

- **TCAD (Traffic Collision Avoidance Device):**
  - Used in small planes, provides information but is not authoritative.

- **TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System):**
  - Used in larger aircraft, actively interrogates other transponders, and is authoritative.
  - Pilots can use it even if other aircraft are not in sight.

**Transponders:**
- Supplement primary RADAR.
- Mode S used in ADS-B.
- Airliners have at least two transponders.
- Signals are used for collision avoidance.

**Attacking Engine Systems:**
- Engine monitors are output-only, recording information for maintenance.
- Some information may be sent via ACARS to the airline or manufacturer.
- Some engine control systems are electronic but have purely mechanical backups.
- Most systems only trim the mechanical system electronically.

**ACARS:**
- Used for communication between the aircraft and ground.
- Messages include weather, delays, updated flight plans, and maintenance information.

**Attacking ACARS:**
- Could create a bogus flight plan update or fake weather.
- Hypothetically, could create fake messages from the plane to the ground.
- Not a practical way to take over an airplane.

**Closing Thoughts:**
- Nearly every protocol used in aviation is unsecured.
- There is potential to annoy ATC and/or small aircraft.
- Increasing automation while continuing with unsecured protocols is problematic.
- Airliners are relatively safe, but vigilance is necessary.
