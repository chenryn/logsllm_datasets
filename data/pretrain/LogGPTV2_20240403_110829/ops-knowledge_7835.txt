User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Send Secondary MX Records I am quite new on administrating so any pointing to the right direction is appreciated.
My mails are send through gmail, which communicates with my mail server that is hosted on centos 6.8, plesk 12.5 and postfix 2.11.5.

My mails to a specific domain are rejected. I can see in my logs that the mail server to which my mails are going is different than the domain of the recipient of the mail.

Contacting the support team of the recipient, the told me that I send the mails to their secondary MX Record and not to their Primary MX Record.

I though this is managed by the recipient mail server.The mail is send to an address and the the recipient MTA figures out how this mail is going to be manipulated.

Is it possible to determine to which MX Record I send the mail?

Bellow is an excerpt from my mail logs

Assistant: Well how it actually works is that - MX records are DNS records telling mail servers where to deliver email for particular domain. Lets say you want to send an email to user@recepientdomain.com. The registrar of the domain recepientdomain.com will have one or more MX records which can look something like

mail.recepientdomain.com 10

mx2.recepientdomain.com 20

The name mail.recepientdomain.com points to some IP address destination at which lies the mail server of the recepient. It does not have to be the same as the IP address of recepientdomain.com. The 10 (or 20) after the MX name means the priority of each MX record - lower number = higher priority

Depending on your mail server configuration the server will most likely do one of two things when you send an email to user@recepientdomain.com:

1) It will deliver the email directly to recepients mail server - your mail server will ask the holder of the domain name recepientdomain.com what are the MX records for that domain. Then it will attempt to contact the mail server at mx records with lowest priority number and delivery the email. If it is not successful on that mx records it will try the next one (if there is one)

2) It will deliver the email to a superhost which will do the delivery to the recepient - it is basically same as number 1) just the superhost communicates with the destination mail server.

So my answer is that the problem is very unlikely to be your end as you dont control which MX record you are sending your email to (unless you really specifically want to).

You can use these commands to find out what their MX records are

nslookup
set type=mx
recepientdomain.com


For google.com it returns


  Non-authoritative answer:
  
  google.com    mail exchanger = 40 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
  
  google.com    mail exchanger = 50 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
  
  ......


And you can then look for the MX records in your postfix log file. Just tested it on mine and the MX information is recorded there as 


  relay =


I hope this helps with your question
