User: I'm trying to monitor log files that some process are running on linux(to create a joint log file where log entries are grouped together by when they happen). Currently I'm thinking of opening the files being logged, polling with inotify(or wrapper) and then checking if I can read any more of the file. 
Is there any better way to do this? Perhaps some library which abstracts the reading/changes in the files watched?
Assistant: If you do it yourself, you might do something like this: If you detect file modification, get the size of the file. If it's larger than last time you can seek to the previous "last" position (i.e. the previous size) and read from there.
