User: Using Python, how does one parse/access files with Linux-specific features, like "~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default"?  I've tried this, but it doesn't work.
Thanks
Assistant: It's important to remember:

use of the tilde ~ expands the home directory as per Poke's answer
use of the forward slash / is the separator for linux / *nix directories
by default, *nix systems such as linux for example has a wild card globbing in the shell, for instance echo *.* will return back all files that match the asterisk dot asterisk (as per Will McCutcheon's answer!)
