innovation deals with complex problems that not 
easily can be negotiated into consensus and where 
people inevitably will disagree when you make 
solutions more concrete, agonism has emerged as a 
fruitful approach to frame our experiments within 
(see illustrated boxes). Also, rather than see these 
experiments or prototypes as designed ‘objects’, we see 
them as a way to construct ‘socio material assemblies’ 
or ‘Things’ where we bring very diverse stakeholders 
and artifacts together to explore issues or matters of 
concern [2, 4, 5, 6, 16].

1.2 Community and design driven living labs
The living lab (LL) concept originates from 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and William 
Mitchell [18] and has been spreading rapidly around 
the globe the last 10 years with more than 400 labs 
as members in the umbrella organisation ENOLL [17]. 
There exist no clear consensus of the definition of 
what a living lab is [20, 37], but most describe them 
as long-term environments for open innovation 
that enables experimentation with real users in real 
contexts [20]. The project Corelabs (connected with 
ENOLL) tried to define a best practice of LL and 
stressed some key concepts as crucial; continuity, 
openness, realism, empowerment of users, and 
spontaneity [11]. These concepts fits very well with 
what we see as essential in an enabling platform. 
However most living labs are strongly driven by 
industry and their interests with consequences for 
how open ‘open innovation’ can be [25] and what is 
regarded as innovation [4, 5]. Our platform is by some 
researchers considered to be one of the few living labs 
driven by the interests of user communities [32].
1.3 Social Innovation in Malmö
Our Research Institute and we as design researchers 
have been positioned within the fields of IT and 
New media for many years. However, when we aim 
to build Malmö Living Labs on the historically and 
geographical qualities of Malmö, Social Innovation

BOX 1.  Small-scale agonistic experiment: Blue Bus
One of the stakeholders we have been collaborating with the longest is the grass root group 
RGRA that is populated by second-generation immigrant youngsters who in their daily work 
use hip-hop as a tool to learn about and change society. They are not only feeling marginal-
ized from the Swedish society in general they also lack distribution channels for their locally 
produced hip-hop music. During an early workshop the idea emerged that local buses could 
become a distribution channels for their music. Through Bluetooth technology available by 
our technology partners Do-Fi we realized that we easily could test this idea. We contacted 
the public transportation company Skånetrafiken and Veolia who operates many of Malmös 
local bus routes. Together we conducted some simple experiments where we commuted for 
some hours on a local bus with a laptop in our knee equipped with software that through 
Bluetooth could send out RGRA:s music to people’s mobile phones. The experiment was very 
well received by the commuters and allowed the disparate constellation to see very differ-
ent potential outcomes and results. RGRA saw the potential of a new distribution channel 
for their music. The bus company saw a potentially new commuter service beyond traditional 
transportation. Do-Fi saw the potential of developing a new product and new services. The 
researchers saw the potential of developing a new research project focusing on place-specific 
media.
Agonistic issue
Maybe the most interesting aspect of the experiment regarded what kind of public space 
the interior of a bus could become (especially if a new media service would be a part of that 
space). Who owns and can appropriate this space? Could it be transformed into a more public 
and inclusive space or would it remain an exclusive space leased out only to commercial 
actors, as is the case today? Some years ago, public transportation, such as buses and trains, 
was owned by the Swedish state. Today they are, to a large degree, outsourced to commercial 
actors who in turn outsource the media spaces on the buses to media and advertisement 
companies, which diminish citizen access to public spaces.

inevitably becomes a crucial field for us to learn 
from and engage in. Ten years ago, Malmö, with some 
300,000 inhabitants in the south of Sweden, was a 
dormant city. All major industries had disappeared. 
Today, it is a vibrant university city with an increasing 
number of small and medium-sized information 
technology (IT), media and design companies and 
regarded as internationally leading when it comes 
to ecological sustainability and clean tech. However 
it’s also a segregated city, with the highest number of 
immigrants in Sweden. Among these immigrant groups 
many are unemployed and a recent report present that 
the differences in health between different areas are 
huge, where people in some parts of Malmö live nearly 
BOX 2.  Small-scale agonistic experiment: Urblove
Malmö is a segregated city, and people living in the city centre 
rarely visit the more peripheral districts and our partner the youth 
organisation RGRA (see example above) whose members live in 
these areas felt that their neighborhoods were largely unknown by 
people living in other parts of the city. (A common view is that their 
neighborhoods are dangerous). The open-ended structure of Malmö 
Living Lab enabled us to evolve the network into a constellation that 
could explore this issue. RGRA connected us to the ‘Little green house’ 
(a meeting place run by the municipality in one of Malmös suburbs) 
and we connected them to the game company Ozma that aimed to 
develop a game platform for urban exploring. Together we initiated a 
set of small-scale experiment where youngsters constructed mobile 
game paths in their local neighborhoods and others where invited 
to come and explore these neighborhoods by playing the games. In a 
follow up experiment we collaborated with local schools to explore 
if this mobile game could become a part of their curriculum (of 
which one of the schools was located in the area Rosengård that is 
considered to be the most dangerous in Sweden). Regarding the results, 
we could see that the game platform provided a framework from which 
the youngsters could construct local stories and where visiting ‘gamers’ 
not only got new stories from these neighborhoods but also started to interact with locals to 
get clues for their games. We also connected a leisure studies researcher to the experiments 
who concluded that the games provided increased geographical mobility and awareness 
about the neighborhoods, but also an increased ‘sense of place’, which implied a stronger 
sense of local security.
Agonistic issue
On an over all level the experiments brought awareness to what parts of the city that are 
worth attention? Malmö is a segregated city and most often areas such as the newly built 
area of Western Harbour which is populated with middle and upper class people and media 
companies gets to represent the city. Other areas with many immigrants such as Rosengård 
and Fosie are depicted less favorable by media. The experiments allowed the people living 
there to tell other kind of stories that potentially could attract people to come and visit.

seven years longer than in other parts of the city [27]. 
This can’t be ignored and it brings our attention not 
only to the scope of social innovation but also to 
several concepts that flourish within that field.
Within technological innovation the concept of Lead 
user [41] has been praised. We have found much more 
clever concepts within design and social innovation 
such as the notion of ‘creative communities’ [29] 
which makes much more sense when targeting 
societal issues and it has inspired how we have been 
looking for capacity and ongoing initiatives in Malmös 
different neighborhoods. In this process we try to see 
marginalized groups as unused assets, with a valuable 
and skilled street level perspective on problems and 
opportunities. Also the approach of including them 
in designing networks and build relational qualities 
and trust [24] has been fruitful for us, as well as the 
strategy to connect bottom up grassroots initiatives 
with more established top down actors (as Murray et al 
frame it ‘linking the bees with the threes’) [31]. Finally 
we find it inspirational with approaches aiming for 
large-scale sustainable changes such as the ‘planning 
by projects’ approach suggested by Manzini & Rizzo 
and the concept of ‘framework project’ where local 
initiatives and projects are triggered, coordinated and 
amplified to reach change on a bigger scale [28]. 
2.  FOUR SETS OF REFLECTIONS
2.2 First set of reflections – the intersection and first steps 
of agonism
Working with Malmö Living Labs some years in the 
intersection of the approaches presented above 
and being a university and design school we have 
seen an enabling platform emerge that engage, 
trigger, mobilize and connect competences. If social 
innovation is our scope and inspiration, participatory 
design is our approach and normative guide, then 
living labs provide the more ‘squared’ framework for 
friendly hacking, scaling up and connecting top down 
and bottom up actors.
BOX3.  Small-scale agonistic experiment: Arabic Game Jam
The market for computer games in the Middle East is growing rapidly [9] and there are few computer 
games that are designed from the perspective of the Arabic Culture [33]. Though Malmö and the 
surrounding region have a great number of strong actors involved in the game industry as well as 
a huge Arabic population that to a large degree are unemployed the idea emerged that unutilized 
competence in the local Arabic community potentially could be used in the games industry. Together 
with RGRA, The municipality of Malmö and Media Evolution we initiated a design experiment to 
explore the potential in bringing the competences of Arabic culture together with game design 
competences. Through a set of workshops that culminated in Arabic Game Jam, a 48-hour full scale 
experiment, where participants from these two groups got together to develop new game ideas 
building on Arabic culture. The event got massive media attention and during the experiment six new 
games where created and new networks where emerging.
Agonistic issue
Although some of the results include new game concepts and new constellations of people with 
mixed competences (bringing forward unutilized competence and unemployed people), the most 
central issue in this experiment was to challenge how different cultures are depicted within computer 
games. It’s a quite hegemonic world where American (and to some degree Japanese) culture dominate 
the market. If at all Arabic culture or people is represented its mostly as terrorists.

BOX 4.  Small-scale agonistic explorations: Herrgårds Women Association
Five women started the multi ethnic 
Herrgårds Women Association (HWA) 
more than 10 years ago in Rosengård 
Malmö as a response to feeling excluded 
from the Swedish society. Many have 
limited skills in Swedish; many are 
illiterates, most lack higher education 
and most live on social welfare. At the 
same time we could see a lot of valuable 
qualities: They have a huge network 
within different communities with trust 
and tight relations in the group. They are 
curious and take a lot of initiatives! There 
is a huge amount of collective knowledge 
in the group. They are friendly and service minded with a welcoming attitude. They are strong as a 
group. Together with them we started to explore what kind of role an NGO potentially could play to 
become a resource in society. Several experiments have been conducted including exploring how 
they could offer new forms of catering services or how they could support newly arrived refugee 
orphans. Many of these experiments showed very good results from a service perspective where the 
women were able to provide new kind of services that others didn’t have the capacity to deliver. 
[22] At the same time, we could see several obstacles, such as the fact that the women lacked a full 
understanding of the Swedish cultural context and knowledge about business processes. To address 
this, we connected HWA with the Göran Network, a large network of businesswomen who initially 
were very enthusiastic to collaborate and together they formulated several business ideas. However 
the collaboration soon imposed several implications. The most severe regarded how to approach the 
collaborative process and if you could do it as a collective (which HWA preferred) or if you should do it 
as an individual (which the Göran Women preferred). During this phase HWA:s premises was also put 
on fire three times which definitely put stop to the ongoing collaboration. 
Agonistic issues
The experiments revealed many opportunities for how an NGO could offer new services to the society. 
Still, it has also created some frustration among us as design researchers, because the ideas have 
been to hard to implement and scale up. However the process has been the most generative of all 
our processes regarding an agonistic perspective where many dilemmas have been generated: If an 
NGO would produce new services in society, what will then be the implications? For example, during 
the prototyping process with HWA some trade union representatives responded very negatively to 
the idea of a non-commercial NGO doing business and accused the women to compete under unfair 
conditions and ”stealing” regular jobs.  Another dilemma, revealed through the prototyping, concerned 
power relations within their families. Upholding patriarchal traditions are common in many Afghan 
and Iraqi families where the husband is seen as the family provider. What happen when the women 
get a position in society that their husbands lack?
Also, both Herrgårds Women Association and Göran network fight for women’s rights, but they do it in 
different ways. For HWA, the individual woman is not as important as the group, while the individuals 
participating from the Göran network emphasized the individual women as the foundation to build 
from.

From PD we have learned how to bring in a 
democratic agenda and an inclusive approach and 
pay attention to ‘who’ we work with. We also try to 
take on the hard cases (High hanging fruits) where 
immediate success not lures around the corner and 
where we build long-term relations between diverse 
stakeholders. Inspired by the idea of framework 
project where local cases are amplified [28] we also 
aim for real societal substantial impact. However, 
for us its important to start from the local projects 
When looking back we can see 
that these public agonistic 
experiments have resulted in 
project ideas, and have revealed 
issues, but we can also see that 
the infrastructuring and the 
agonistic Things have been too 
short-lived.
and having the framework project emerge bottom 
up, where we as Nabeel Hamdi argues ‘don’t design 
to much’. Overdesign often inhibits progress and 
development and we rather tries to create a balance 
between emergence and strategic design [21]. This 
process which we have described as infrastructuring 
[4, 5] allows a more on going and open-ended 
structure to evolve, both regarding constellations, 
who will participate, and questions and issues, 
what to explore and how to do it. Its characterized 
by a continuous process of building relations with 
diverse actors and by a flexible allotment of time 
and resources. This more organic approach facilitates 
the emergence of possibilities along the way and 
tries to make use of the creative potential in the 
heterogeneous city, where serendipity could play 
a role and unexpected and exiting combinations 
of people could become productive through a 
continuous matchmaking process. 
Being part of the living labs movement have provided 
some advantages when acting as an enabling platform 
and aiming for impact. It offers opportunities to 
‘linking the bees to the threes’ [31] where we bring 
together bottom up grass root initiatives with more 
81
powerful and established (conservative) top down 
stakeholders (where the LL concept has been fairly 
well rooted). ENOLL is also as a huge community to 
spread and scaling up ideas and even though most 
living labs have tech innovation (rather than social 
innovation) as the main focus the concept of living lab 
is still contested terrain.
When looking back we can see that these public 
agonistic experiments have resulted in project ideas, 
new services and products, in new constellations 
and revealed issues, but we can also see that the 
infrastructuring and the agonistic Things have been 
too short lived. Although issues have been raised 
during the experiments, we have found it difficult to 
manage and package the result so that they would 
have enough impact to challenge the dominant 
hegemony. For Malmö Living Labs the challenge is 
how to maintain an agonistic platform that sustains 
and facilitates debates and struggles while protecting 
the people involved. Should we, together with RGRA, 
have gone into an agonistic negotiation with the bus 
company concerning who should own and occupy 
the digital spaces on the buses? In the case of HWA 
(see below), should the business controversy between 
a Swedish businesswomen’s perspective and an 
immigrant NGO collective’s perspective have been 
made public? So far we have only been taking the 
first steps to explore this approach but we believe 
in line with Carl diSalvo that agonism can work as a 
generative frame for PD [14].
2.2. Second set of reflections - Friendly hacking into the 
incubator 
To create more space for our experiments and 
acquire the power to reach impact and large-scale 
change, we have recently been inspired by the French 
innovation lab La 27e Région [26] and their friendly 
hacking approach [39] and tried to reach into the 
public sector. Our way to do this has been to build 
alliances with key civil servants and other research 
disciplines such as Urban Studies (that have more 
mandate, power and respect among civil servants). 
Through this approach we got involved in a process 
initiated by the municipality that aimed at establishing 
an incubator for social innovation in the city. We got 
the commission to elaborate how the incubator could 
be structured, as well as how its main features and 
support functions should be designed. Once more, 
the first crucial question for us, as in all participatory 
projects, was: Who should have a say in this process? 
Who should be included? Our strategy was to start 
the design process from needs expressed by six local 
grass-root initiatives or small companies that could 
act as potential users of services that the future

incubator could provide. Besides these initiatives 
(including RGRA & HWA) we also invited civil servants 
representing different municipal departments, people 
from organizations supporting social entrepreneurial 
initiatives, investors, business developers and 
researchers to a series of workshops.
The results from the workshop revealed something 
quite different than a traditional business incubator. 
It was a structure that stressed a free zone where 
the different actors (civil servants, grass-roots, SME:s, 
researchers) could co-own processes, learn from each 
other and enter into new working roles and relations 
outside their ordinary inhibiting everyday practice. One 
of the more central and interesting outcomes regarded
