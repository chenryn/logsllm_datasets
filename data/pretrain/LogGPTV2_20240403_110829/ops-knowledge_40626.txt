User: In perl debugger I can use DB::get_fork_TTY() to debug both parent and child process in different terminals.  Is there anything similar in python debugger?
Or, is there any good way to debug fork in python?
Assistant: But I'm still curious if there's any similar feature in python debugger. I happen to find this feature in perldb and I find it's very handy

No.
You don't need it.
No matter how handy it may appear in other environments, you just don't need it.
You don't need fork() in Python; therefore you don't need fancy debugging to work with fork().
If you think you need fork() you should either use subprocess, multiprocessing or C.
