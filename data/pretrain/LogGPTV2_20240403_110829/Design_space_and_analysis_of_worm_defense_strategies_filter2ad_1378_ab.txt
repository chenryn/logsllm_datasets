shown in Figure 2, tb is useful because it divides a worm’s
lifetime into two phases: acceleration and deceleration, and
can be calculated as d2I(t)
dt2 = 0. The tb reference point is
useful for many categories because it indicates whether the
defense slows down a worm prior to its natural breaking
point.
3.2 Effectiveness of Proactive Protection
We ﬁrst analyze the eﬀectiveness of Proactive Protection
with full deployment (I(t) = Ip(t)). We can derive the time
The above analysis shows that Proactive Protection slows
down the worm propagation by a factor of 1/p.
We now consider partial deployment (I(t) = Ip(t)+Inp(t))
where α fraction of the vulnerable hosts deploy Proactive
Protection. We derive the time evolution of the number
of infected hosts participating (Ip(t)) and not participating
(Inp(t)) as:
dIp(t)
dt
=
βαpI(t)(Np − Ip(t))
Np
dInp(t)
dt
=
β(1 − α)I(t)(Nnp − Inp(t))
Nnp
(6)
(7)
Equation 6 shows the worm infection rate for the α pro-
tected hosts is reduced by less than 1
p since non-participating
infected hosts also contribute to protected host infections.
Since Proactive Protection is a proactive defense, one may
wish to calculate the protection probability needed to ensure
a given breaking point tb. We calculate this as follows:
d2
dt2  
N
1 + e−pβt(N −C)
C
!˛˛˛˛˛t=tb
By solving Equation 8 for p, we get:
= 0
(8)
p =
ln N −C
C

3.3 Effectiveness of Reactive Antibody Defense
We ﬁrst analyze the eﬀectiveness of Reactive Antibody
Defense techniques with full deployment (I(t) = Ip(t)). As-
suming the reaction time for generating and disseminating
the (perfect) antibody is δa, we derive the time evolution of

I(t) as:
dI(t)
dt
=8 δa
(10)
Equation 10 mirrors the idea that before an antibody is
found all hosts are completely unprotected (t ≤ δa), but
after antibody is created and disseminated (t > δa) no fur-
ther infections occur. Therefore, antibody strategies should
minimize δa.
The solution to Equations 10 with C initially infected
hosts is:
I(t) =8>><>>:
=8 δa
(11)
Now we consider partial deployment (I(t) = Ip(t)+Inp(t))
when α fraction of the vulnerable hosts are protected by
Reactive Antibody Defense.
βαI(t)(Np−Ip(t))
Np
0
when t ≤ δa
when t > δa
=
β(1 − α)I(t)(Nnp − Inp(t))
Nnp
(12)
(13)
The solution to the system of diﬀerential equations is:
I(t) =
N
1 + e−βt(N −C)
C
when t ≤ δa
(14)
Ip(t) = Ip(δa) when t > δa
Inp(t) =
Ip(δa) + Nnp
1 − Ae−(1−α)βt − Ip(δa) when t > δa
(15)
(16)
where A is some constant.
The above analysis shows that given the reaction time δa,
the deployment ratio has no inﬂuence on the protection of
participating hosts. Non-participating hosts indirectly bene-
ﬁt from a larger deployment ratio after t > δa. The reason is
at this point uninfected participating hosts are eﬀectively re-
moved from the vulnerable population, resulting in a slower
worm propagation.
3.4 Effectiveness of Reactive Address Black-
listing
We ﬁrst analyze Reactive Address Blacklisting techniques
with full deployment (I(t) = Ip(t)). The reaction time δb is
the time to add a newly infected host to the global blacklist.
We derive the time evolution of the number of infected hosts
I(t) as:
dI(t)
dt
=
β(I(t) − I(t − δb))(N − I(t))
N
(17)
Now we consider the case when the Reactive Address
Blacklisting is deployed to cover α fraction of the vulner-
able hosts (I(t) = Ip(t) + Inp(t)).
dInp(t)
dt
=
β(1 − α)I(t)(Nnp − Inp(t))
Nnp
(19)
These equations quantify the intuition that a smaller re-
action time slows down a worm’s propagation.
Here, we brieﬂy discuss the minimum reaction time re-
quired for an eﬀective defense.
Intuitively, if we can add
a newly infected machine to the blacklist before it infects
another machine, the Reactive Address Blacklisting defense
may stop the exponential worm growth. Within each time
unit the infected nodes can contact β vulnerable hosts. Thus,
if the reaction time δb is faster than 1
β , then the worm prop-
agation to the hosts that deploy the defense can be eﬀec-
tively stopped. We call this threshold 1
β the phase transition
threshold. On the other hand, if the reaction time δb is slower
than 1
β , then the worm propagation cannot be stopped and
will eventually infect all the vulnerable hosts. Thus, the re-
quirement for an eﬀective Reactive Address Blacklisting is
to ensure
δb ≤
1
β
(20)
To demonstrate the eﬀect of the phase transition thresh-
old, we depict in Figure 3 the inﬂuence of the reaction time
on the eﬀectiveness of Reactive Address Blacklisting, ob-
tained from both theoretical analysis and simulation results.
Note that the phase transition threshold, 1
β , is about 10
seconds for Slammer. The graphs show that our theoreti-
cal analysis (dotted lines) match well our simulation results
(solid lines). From the graphs, we can clearly see that the
defense is eﬀective when the reaction time is lower than 1
β .
In these cases, the number of infected machines for 100%
deployment is close to zero. On the other hand, if δb is far
higher, even 100% deployment of Reactive Address Black-
listing cannot stop the spread of worm.
3.5 Effectiveness of Local Containment
We consider the case where α fraction of vulnerable hosts
are covered by a Local Containment mechanism. The full
deployment case is easily derived with α = 1. Assume the
throttling rate is β1, i.e., an infected hosts covered by the
Local Containment mechanism only has an eﬀective contact
rate of β1. Let β2 = β1α + β(1 − α). Thus the worm
propagation model is:
dI(t)
dt
=
β2I(t)(N − I(t))
N
(21)
The solution to Equation 21 with C initially infected hosts
is:
I(t) =
N
1 + e(−β2 t)(N −C)
C
(22)
Note that the best case is where β1 is close to zero, i.e.,
.
β2
= β(1 − α). Thus, even in the optimal local containment
where the infected hosts covered by the Local Containment
do not infect any other hosts, this defense approach can still
only slow down the worm propagation by a factor of 1/(1 −
α). For example, even if α = 50%, this defense approach
can only slow down the worm propagation by a factor of
two; and a deployment ratio of 90% can only slow down the
worm propagation by a factor of 10.

Figure 3: The reaction time for Reactive Address Blacklisting . We compare the eﬀectiveness of the Reactive
Address Blacklisting strategy against Slammer with diﬀerent reaction times. The experimental data (solid
lines) and the theoretical data (dotted lines) match well. When the reaction is low enough, as in (a) and (b),
the number of infected machines for 100% deployment is very close to zero.
Defense strategies may be combined to create hybrid de-
fense systems. In this section we analyze the eﬀectiveness of
hybrid worm defense systems.
4.1 Effectiveness of Combined Defenses
In this section we provide the theoretic framework for hy-
brids of two strategies. For brevity, we only give results for
a fully deployed hybrid (I(t) = Ip(t)). Note the incremental
deployment cases can be derived similar to proceeding sec-
tions by separating the participating and non-participating
populations. The worm propagation models under diﬀerent
hybrid defense strategies, along with a short explanation of
the eﬀect, are given by:
• Proactive Protection + Reactive Antibody Defense:
dI(t)
dt
=8 δa
(23)
Proactive Protection slows down the number of hosts
infected until the antibody can be created and dissem-
inated.
• Proactive Protection + Reactive Address Blacklisting:
dI(t)
dt
=
pβ(I(t) − I(t − δb))(N − I(t))
N
(24)
Proactive Protection makes it less likely an infected
host will successfully infect another host before being
added to the blacklist.
• Proactive Protection + Local Containment:
dI(t)
dt
=
pβ2I(t)(N − I(t))
N
(25)
Adding Local Containment to Proactive Protection
yields the same eﬀect as increasing p with Proactive
Protection alone (and similarly for Proactive Protec-
tion).
• Reactive Antibody Defense + Reactive Address Black-
listing:
dI(t)
dt
=8 δa
(26)

Reactive Address Blacklisting can help slow down the
worm propagation before the anti-body can be gener-
ated and disseminated.

• Reactive Address Blacklisting + Local Containment:

N
(28)
Local Containment slows down worm propagation un-
til an infected machine can be blacklisted.
4.2 Hybrid Considerations
Proactive Protection is a proactive strategy that can be
deployed before a worm is ever released, and as a result
is more synergistic when combined with Reactive Address
Blacklisting or Reactive Antibody Defense strategies. The
resulting hybrid aﬀords hosts protection to a new worms
while eventually providing complete protection after a new
worm is released.
For example, Newsome and Song [21] proposes a hybrid
approach using address space randomization and dynamic
taint analysis. The address space randomization slows down
a worm propagation on protected hosts, while the dynamic
taint analysis is used to craft a signature antibody to ﬁlter
out a worm.
The Reactive Address Blacklisting + Reactive Antibody
Defense hybrid and Proactive Protection + Local Contain-
ment are less synergistic and therefore the combination seems
less compelling. The analysis, however, may be useful for
measurement purposes since the combinations may appear
serendipitously, e.g., some sites deploy Reactive Address
Blacklisting and some sites deploy Reactive Antibody De-
fense.
5. COMPARISON OF DEFENSE STRATE-
GIES – CURRENT WORMS
To make the theoretical analysis in the previous sections
more concrete, in this section we compare the diﬀerent strate-
gies for two real-world worms: one based upon CodeRed [18]
and the other based upon Slammer [17]. Both CodeRed and
Slammer scan hosts picked at random, and are representa-
tive of current worms on the internet. We show that the
simulated results conﬁrm our theoretical predictions. In the
next section we extend our analysis to smarter worms.
5.1 Evaluation Setup
Address Blacklisting, and Local Containment– for defending
against a CodeRed (a-d) and Slammer (e-h) outbreak. Each
graph shows the evolution of the infected host population
based upon 5 diﬀerent incremental deployment (α) values:
0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The simulation results (solid
lines in the graph) conﬁrm our theoretical formulas (dotted
lines).
5.1.1 Simulation Setup
Our simulator is an extension of the Warhol Worm simula-
tor [27] where we implemented diﬀerent defense strategies.
Complete connectivity is assumed within a 32-bit address
space, with each link having a bandwidth between 14.4kbps
and 4.5Mbps. Initial infected nodes, vulnerable nodes, and
participant nodes are uniformly distributed.
Unlike in theoretical analysis discussed in Section 3 where
a machine starts infecting others right after it is contacted
by a worm, our simulation considers the infection time in
order to make it more realistic. Infection time is the time
taken to transfer a worm code from a machine to another.
It depends on the bandwidth and the size of worm code.
Due to the existence of infection time in our simulation, the
worm propagation will be a little slower than that in theory.
5.1.2 CodeRed and Slammer Worms
The CodeRed worm, released in 2001,
infected almost
360,000 Internet hosts over fourteen hours by exploiting
a bug in the Microsoft IIS web server [18]. The Slam-
mer worm, released in 2002, infected about 100,000 hosts
within ten minutes by exploiting bugs in the Microsoft SQL
server and the MSDE 2002 server [17]. We use CodeRed as
an example of a worm with a modest contact rate (0.0005
hosts/sec) and Slammer as an example of a fast contact rate
(0.093 hosts/sec), each of which employs random scanning
to ﬁnd vulnerable hosts 3. Note that these contact rates are
calculated from the data in [18, 17]. The sizes of worm code
are also diﬀerent. CodeRed TCP/IP packet is about 4kB
while Slammer uses only 404 bytes.
5.1.3 Parameter Setup
In order to give a more concrete feeling to the analysis, we
pick some concrete parameters to conduct simulation eval-
uations. In all our experiments unless otherwise noted, we
use the following parameters. Although in the remaining
sections we note when results may be drastically diﬀerent
with diﬀerent parameter choices, the reader should always
bear in mind the speciﬁc results provided are a result of the
speciﬁc parameter values chosen.
In our simulations, for Proactive Protection, we choose the
protection probability p = 2−16 as in [23]. For the Reactive
Antibody Defense strategy, we use two reaction time val-
ues to mimic the scan rate diﬀerence between CodeRed and
Slammer: δa = 2 hours for CodeRed and δa = 1 minute for
Slammer. Similarly, for Reactive Address Blacklisting, we
set reaction time δb = 20 minutes for CodeRed and δb = 30
seconds for Slammer. For Local Containment, we set the
throttling rate β1 = 1 host/second.
5.2 Partial Deployment Strategy Comparison
Figure 4 shows the eﬀectiveness of the four strategies –
Proactive Protection, Reactive Antibody Defense, Reactive
3Note that the contact rate β = N
232 × scan rate.
We see that under the simulation parameter, with Proac-
tive Protection, Reactive Antibody Defense and Reactive
Address Blacklisting, very few participating hosts are in-
fected in the measured time period even with a small incre-
mental deployment factor α. Note in the Proactive Protec-
tion scheme the slope is slightly increasing, and eventually
after a long time all hosts will be infected. We also see that
increasing α for Proactive Protection and Reactive Antibody
Defense signiﬁcantly decreases the total infected population.
Local Containment only slows down the worm propagation.
5.3 Overall vs. Participation Infection Factor
Analysis
In order to understand how participation inﬂuences the
infection factors, we evaluate both participation infection
factor (PIF) and non-participation factor (NPIF) (as deﬁned
in Section 2) for two diﬀerent deployment ratios: 25% and
75%. Figure 5 shows the result of our theoretical analysis
and simulation results for each strategy.
With the CodeRed worm (Figure 5 a-d), participants of
Reactive Antibody Defense are completely protected and
Proactive Protection participants are protected within the
time period measured (there is a very slight upward slope
in the graph that would continue to 100% with Proactive
Protection), while all non-participants all become infected.
These results demonstrate a strong motivation for hosts to
participate in such strategies when possible. Reactive Ad-
dress Blacklisting does an adequate job protecting partici-
pants, with about 40% infected. Everyone in a Local Con-
tainment strategy is infected within the time period mea-
sured, with no noticeable beneﬁt for participants.
The Slammer worm results (Figure 5 e-h) are similar to
CodeRed for the Proactive Protection, Reactive Antibody
Defense, and Reactive Address Blacklisting strategies. Local
Containment participants do noticeably worse as the scan
rate is much faster than the reaction time for adding hosts
to the blacklist.
6. COMPARISON OF DEFENSE STRATE-
GIES – TOMORROW’S SMART WORMS
In this section we investigate smart worms that may ap-
pear in the future. We ﬁrst design a new kind of smart
worm that targets Proactive Protection schemes, and ana-
lyze a proposed defense. We then use the same parameters
as Section 5, except we change the worm to use a hit-list
instead of random scanning. A hit-list worm knows a priori
which hosts are vulnerable and does not waste time scanning
non-vulnerable hosts [27].
6.1 Brute-force worms
Our analysis so far has indicated Proactive Protection is
an eﬀective defense strategy. However, Proactive Protec-
tion is vulnerable to a brute force attack in which a worm
repeatedly attempts infection until a protected host is in-
fected. If Proactive Protection were deployed tomorrow, we
