User: I am creating a weather station using a Raspberry Pi.  I have a mySQL database setup for the different sensors (temp, humidity, pressure, rain, etc) and am now getting to processing the wind sensors.
I have a python program that watches the GPIO pins for the anemometer and counts the pulses to calculate the wind speed.  It also reads from a wind vane processes through an ADC to get the direction.  For the other sensors I only process them every few minutes and dump the data directly to the DB. Because I have to calculate a lot of things from the wind sensor data, I don't necessarily want to write to the DB every 5 seconds and then have to read back the past 5 minutes of data to calculate the current speed and direction.  I would like to collect the data in memory, do the processing, then write the finalized data to the DB.  The sensor reading is something like:
datetime, speed, direction
2013-6-20 09:33:45, 4.5, W
2013-6-20 09:33:50, 4.0, SW
2013-6-20 09:33:55, 4.3, W
The program is calculating data every 5 seconds from the wind sensors.  I would like to write data to the DB every 5 minutes.  Because the DB is on an SD card I obviously don't want to write to the DB 60 times, then read it back to process it, then write it to the permanent archival DB every 5 minutes.
Would I be better off using a list of lists? Or a dictionary of tuples keyed by datetime?
{datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 20, 9, 33, 45, 631816): ('4.5', 'W')}
{datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 20, 9, 33, 50, 394820): ('4.0', 'SW')}
{datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 20, 9, 33, 55, 387294): ('4.3', 'W')}
For the latter, what is the best way to update a dictionary? Should I just dump it to a DB and read it back?  That seems like an excessive amount of read/writes a day for so little data.
Assistant: In my general experience, it is easier to work with a dictionary keyed by datetime. A list of lists can get very confusing, very quickly.
I'm not certain, however, how to best update a dictionary. It could be that my Python is rusty, but it would seem to me that dumping to a DB and reading back is a bit redundant, though it may just be that your statement was a smidgen unclear. Is there any way you can dump to a variable inside of your program?
If not, I think dumping to DB and reading back may be your only option...but again, my Python is a bit rusty.
That said, while I don't want to be a Programmaticus Takeitovericus, but I was wondering if you've ever looked into XML for data storage? I ended up swapping to it because I found it was easier to work with than a database, and involved far less reading and writing. I don't know your project specs, so this suggestion may be pointless to you altogether.
