User: I installed python 3.2 edition, but when I opened wingIDE, my MAC still only show the old edition phthon 2.6.1. I tried to use "configure python"-enter python3.2 in "python executable", then found nothing changed, python 2.6.1 still appeared in wingIDE. Any suggestion?

I just tried to launch WINGIDE again and this time it indicates the python 3.2, the newest edition i installed. hmmmm, funny, i didn't change anything and it recognized it now! But when i use terminal, it still only recognize python 2.6.
Assistant: The reason is because the "python" shortcut doesn't exist in "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin", which is the newly created binary location.
Create a soft link to "python" as a work around. 
"ln -s python python3.4". 
Also, make sure that your .bash_profile has an entry for /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin directory.
Verify with "Python -V"
