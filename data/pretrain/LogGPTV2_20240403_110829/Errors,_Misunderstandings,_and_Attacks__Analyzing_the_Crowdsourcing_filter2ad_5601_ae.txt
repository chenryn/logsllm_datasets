# Ad-Server Domains and Their Management in EasyList

## Table 10: Number of Ad-Server Domains Added or Removed from the EasyList Blacklist
| Ad Network | Added | Removed | Since |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| PopAds     | 8,541 | 6       | Sep-2016 |
| Propellerads | 910  | 1       | Apr-2016 |
| Yavli      | 338   | 3       | Oct-2014 |
| Uponit     | 207   | 2       | Feb-2018 |
| Hilltopads | 155   | 4       | Jan-2018 |
| Tag adservers | 47  | 47      | Feb-2017 |
| Admiral    | 38    | 2       | Jan-2017 |

The table above shows the number of ad-server domains added or removed from the EasyList blacklist. The "Since" column indicates the first time a domain was added to EasyList.

## Ad-Blocking and Evasion Techniques

### 1. Changing Ad-Server Domains
Ad networks frequently change their ad server domains to avoid being blocked. Our dataset reveals that the number of ad server domains and IPs has increased from 505 in 2009 to 15,500 in January 2019. On average, 146 domains were added per month, while 72 were removed. Approximately 20% of the listed ad server domains (as of January 15, 2019) belonged to 7 major ad networks. 

We found that the number of added domains significantly exceeded the number of removed ones. Further investigation revealed that EasyList did not effectively manage obsolete and redundant domains. For example, 104 duplicated domains belonging to Propellerads were listed in May 2017 and were only removed in March 2018.

Using historical traffic data from Alexa Web Information Service (AWIS), we analyzed 567,293 records of 6,903 ad-server domains. We observed that 52% of the ad servers' traffic disappeared three days after being added to EasyList, likely due to the four-day update cycle. Recently, EasyList has changed its update frequency to one day, which may further impact ad server traffic.

### 2. Changing Ad-Element Attributes
Website developers can evade ad blockers by changing ad element attributes. Our analysis showed that EasyList lacks the capability to automatically track these changes. New elements are only blocked if reported through crowdsourcing. Occasionally, EasyList editors replace old filters with new ones when popular ad networks make widespread changes. We identified 553 instances where EasyList changed filters in response to such evasions, with an average delay of 10.3 days. About 88% of these instances involved clients of the ad network Yavli.

### 3. Changing the Path of Ad Source
Ad publishers can also circumvent ad blockers by altering the URLs' paths. We found 644 websites that changed their ad URL paths, with approximately 47.6% being clients of the ad network Yavli.

## Non-Studied Attacks

### 1. Exploiting Obsolete Whitelist Filters
EasyList does not track domains in whitelist filters, leading to potential abuse. Over the past nine years, EasyList editors have manually handled dead filters 82 times and removed 353 domains from the whitelist. For instance, shackvideo.com, added to the whitelist in November 2010, was deleted in May 2016 but later exploited to deliver ads. EasyList discovered and addressed this issue in January 2017.

### 2. Using Generic Exception Rules
Some ad networks use generic exception rules to bypass ad blocking. For example, jpost.com exploited the exception filter `@@||redtube.com*/adframe.js` to deliver ads using a modified URL. This abuse was discovered in November 2016, more than two years after the rule was created.

### 3. Exploiting False Positive Errors
Some websites create false positives by linking ad elements with legitimate content. When ads are blocked, non-ad elements are also blocked, causing issues for users. EasyList needs to address these false positives to improve user experience.

### 4. First-Party Content and Inline Script
Websites use inline scripts and first-party content to detect and bypass ad blockers. EasyList has started using Content Security Policies (CSP) to block inline scripts. By May 2018, 142 websites were added to the blacklist, with 78% in the top 100K Alexa rank.

### 5. ISP Injecting Ads
ISPs may inject HTML, CSS, or JavaScript into HTTP responses to deliver ads. This method is limited to HTTP and can be used to circumvent filter lists. EasyList's countermeasure is to block IP addresses, but this is not a fundamental solution.

### 6. Background Redirection
Ad publishers use techniques like Tab-unders to redirect users to advertisement pages. This issue was reported in May 2015, and while Chrome has taken steps to block Tab-under navigation, other browsers have not yet followed suit.

### 7. Exploiting WebRTC
Ad networks use WebRTC to establish real-time communications and deliver ads. In May 2018, EasyList and Adblock Plus started blocking ads using WebRTC, adding 220 website domains and 139 ad-server domains to the blacklist.

### 8. CSS Background Image Hack
Some websites use CSS background image hacks to display ads. EasyList has created special filters with new syntax to counter this, applying it to 40 websites in 2016 and 2017.

## Discussion

Our analysis highlights the significant number of false positive errors and the need for better communication between website owners and EasyList. Ad-blocking systems, while enhancing security, face numerous evasion techniques. Future research should focus on developing more effective detection and resolution methods to address these challenges.
