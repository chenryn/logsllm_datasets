User: I need to play .wav files stored on my PC using Python script from Cygwin.
Please advice if this is possible? If so please provide pointers etc, to Python script code which can be used from Cygwin. I am working on a 64-bit Windows 7 machine.
This is what I have done so far.

Downloaded and installed setup-x86_64.exe from cygwin website.
Installed packages as part of Cygwin:  make,gcc,g++,git,ssh,sox,python ver >= 2.7, curl,wget. 

Please advice on how to play .wav files using Python (version >= 2.7) from Cygwin.
Assistant: try os.system("cat /path/foo.wav > /dev/dsp")
You need to install audio package for Cygwin first.
