These settings parallel each other and are also confusing with
`transport.type`. This causes problems in tests sometimes since we randomize
the first two settings. So if a test wants to rely on, eg always using netty,
it has to remember to set _two_ settings, to make sure randomization doesn't
mess this up. And if the test forgets one, it can have weird consequences,
like the wrong transport address instance being created, causing class cast
exceptions like in #12788.
I think we should minimize these to as single setting (preferably
`transport.type` since that is the pluggable setting).
