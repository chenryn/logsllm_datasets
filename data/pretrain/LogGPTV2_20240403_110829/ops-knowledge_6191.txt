User: I wanted to use ReportLab's RenderPM to generate images on Google App-Engine but it looks like it depends on c libraries. Does anyone know if it's possible to get it working? 
Thanks, 
Richard
Assistant: Just to close the question - as indicated by Wooble, reportlab itself works fine on Appengine (being pure python) but the RenderPM library doesn't.
