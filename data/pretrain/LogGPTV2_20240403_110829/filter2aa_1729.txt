BLE is designed to make sniï¬€ing diï¬€icult: 
3 separate advertising channels
Uses Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
(FHSS)
Master or slave can renegotiate some
parameters at any time
Sniï¬€ing BLE connections is either hard or
expensive

HOW BLE MITM WORKS
HOW BLE MITM WORKS
Discover the target device (advertisement data,
services & characteristics)
Connect to this target device, it is not advertising
anymore (connected state)
Advertise the same device, await connections and
forward data

Pros:
Get rid of the 3 advertising channels issue
You see every BLE operation performed
You may tamper on-the-fly the data sent or
received
Cons:
Complex to setup: 1 VM & 1 Host computer
Only capture HCI events, not BLE Link Layer
Does not support all types of pairing
Only compatible with 4.0 adapters
WE ARE DOING IT WRONG !
WE ARE DOING IT WRONG !
Ubertooth-btle is outdated and does not work with
recent BLE stacks
Nordic Semiconductor' sniï¬€er is closed source and
does not allow active connection sniï¬€ing and may
be discontinued
The MitM approach seems great but too diï¬€icult to
use and does not intercept link-layer packets

1. Identify Access Address (32 bits)
2. Recover the CRCInit value used to compute packets
CRC
3. Recover hop interval (time spent on each channel)
4. Recover hop increment (channel hopping increment)
MIKE'S ASSUMPTION (2013)
MIKE'S ASSUMPTION (2013)
All 37 data channels are used
DATA CHANNELS IN 2018
DATA CHANNELS IN 2018
Not all channels are used to improve reliability
Some channels are remapped to keep a 37 channels
hopping sequence
0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 0, 4, 8, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 3, 7,

HOW TO DEDUCE CHANNEL MAP AND
HOP INTERVAL
HOP INTERVAL
Channel map
Listen for packets on every possible channels
May take until 4 x 37 seconds to determine !
Hop interval
Find a unique channel
Measure time between 2 packets and divide by 37
DEDUCE HOP INCREMENT
DEDUCE HOP INCREMENT
Pick 2 unique channels
Generate a lookup table
Measure time between two packets on these
channels
Determine increment value

Defines when a parameter update is eï¬€ective
Used for:
