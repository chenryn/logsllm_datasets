User: How to use Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring and visualization? Please explain how Prometheus works, how to write Prometheus configuration files and visualize them in Grafana.
Assistant: 1. Prometheus working principle: Prometheus is an open source distributed monitoring system, which uses pull model (pull mode): regularly pull (pull) metrics data from the monitored target server, and store it in the local time series database . Prometheus also provides various ways to query and aggregate data, and expose the results for consumption by other systems. 2. Write the configuration file of Prometheus: The configuration file of Prometheus is called prometheus.yml, which defines the target server to be monitored, the crawling interval, the name and label of the metric, and other information. The following is an example of a simple configuration file: global: scrape_interval: 15s evaluation_interval: 15s scrape_configs: - job_name: 'node_exporter' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] The above configuration specifies a job named node_exporter with a target of For the local Node Exporter, the default fetching interval is 15 seconds. 3. Visual display in Grafana: Grafana is a popular open source data visualization tool that can display the metrics data in Prometheus in the form of charts and dashboards. Here are some basic steps: - Add Prometheus data source in Grafana, specify Prometheus URL and other information. - Create a new dashboard and add a chart panel. - In the edit mode of the panel, specify the metric query statement of Prometheus, and select the appropriate chart type and style. For example, here is an example of a Prometheus-based CPU usage dashboard: - Create a new dashboard. - Add a Graph panel. - On the Metrics tab, select the Prometheus data source, enter the query statement node_cpu{mode="idle"}, and press the Apply button. - Adjust the properties of the panel, such as title, time range, Y-axis units, etc. 4. The visualization effect of Prometheus and Grafana: The combination of Prometheus and Grafana can achieve rich monitoring and visualization effects, as shown in the following figure: ![Prometheus and Grafana monitor and visualizza performance](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/ gh/Wisdomshadow/Blog-images-storage/2022/02/10e467332e619340.png)
