FFT truncation effect, and the time-domain joint. First, the mea-
surement involves exponential computation, where the round-off
errors can be accumulated so that the amplitude estimation is not
accurate, finally bringing about parasitic vibration in the modulated
replay signals. Second, the real FFT operation works on a finite-
length signal, which is equivalent to adding a window function to
an infinite-length signal. The window function in the time domain
corresponds to a ùë†ùëñùëõùëê(ùë•) function convolved in the frequency do-
main, causing the frequency spectrum to expand and overlap. Third,
when splicing the reconstructed signals into new audio, there is no
guarantee of the continuity at the starting and ending splice points.
A discontinuous splice point can lead to ringing artifacts due to the
Gibbs phenomenon [77].
Moreover, ringing artifacts cannot be further compensated by
a higher-order filter since ringing artifacts only occur after the
replay process rather than after the modulation process. Moreover,
the iterative filtering scheme can reduce ringing artifacts in image
restoration that are mainly caused by overshoot and oscillations in
the step response of an image filter [63]. However, it is not suitable
for speech signals because the ringing artifacts are introduced by
hardware properties. Even if attackers might reduce ringing arti-
facts to a certain extent, the time-domain defense can still detect
modulated replay audio. This is because our method does not rely
on the amplitude threshold of ringing artifacts. Although the ampli-
tude of ringing artifacts may decrease, the local extrema cannot be
eliminated. The time-domain defense uses local extrema as features
so that even small ringing artifacts can be detected.
5 EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct experiments in a real testbed to evaluate
the modulated replay attack and our defense.
Figure 7: The testbed in our experiments.
5.1 Experiment Setup
We use a TASCAM DR-40 digital recorder for collecting the voice
signals. The sampling rate of the digital recorder is set to 96 kHz by
default. We conduct real experiments with a variety of common elec-
tronic devices in our lives, including iPhone X, iPad Pro, Mi Phone 4,
Google Nexus 5, Bose Soundlink Micro, and Samsung UN65H6203
Smart TV. Figure 7 shows the testbed in our experiments. We aim to
demonstrate that both our attack and countermeasure scheme can
be applied to various speaker devices. To generate modulated re-
play audios, we apply MATLAB to estimate the amplitude response
and design the inverse filter for different speakers. Due to space
constraints, we put the details in Appendix C.
ASVspoof 2017 [29] and ASVspoof 2019 [61] are two popular
databases for replay attacks. However, we cannot convert the replay
attack samples in these two databases into modulated replay attacks,
due to the lack of information of replay devices. Instead, to conduct
a fair comparison between modulated replay audio and classic
replay audio, we collect an in-house dataset with 6 replay devices.
For each of these replay devices, the dataset contains 222 modulated
replay audios as well as 222 corresponding classic replay audios.
All audio signals are collected in a quiet lab environment. We use
10-fold cross-validation accuracy as a metric since it can reflect the
whole performance of the system. Moreover, we implement the
prototype of our defense DualGuard in C++ language and run it on
a popular voice interactive platform, i.e., ReSpeakerCore v2.
with those in the genuine audio. The spectrum difference is a vital
feature in the various classic replay detection methods.
Figure 8(c) shows the spectrum of the modulated replay audio
collected by the ASR system. We can see that the low-frequency
energy is greatly enhanced to cope with the speaker effects. Thus,
the spectrum of the modulated replay audio is very similar to that
of the genuine audio in Figure 8(a). Moreover, we quantify the sim-
ilarity between the modulated replay audio and the genuine audio
using the L2 norm comparison [43] that has been widely used to
compare the spectrums of audio. It is defined as ‚à•ùêæ1 ‚àí ùêæ2‚à•2
2, where
ùêæ1 and ùêæ2 are two normalized spectrum distributions of audio, and
‚à•¬∑‚à•2
2 is the square of Euclidean distance. The smaller the L2 norm
is, the more similar the two audios are. We measure the similarity
values on 660 pairs of audio samples, the average similarity between
the modulated replay audio and the genuine audio is 1.768 √ó 10‚àí4.
However, the average similarity between the direct replay audio
and the genuine audio ùëÜùëüùëî is 15.71√ó10‚àí4 on average, which is much
larger than the similarity between the modulated replay audio and
the genuine audio. The results demonstrate that the modulated
replay audio is much more similar to the genuine audio.
Furthermore, we re-implement 8 popular detection methods that
can be divided in three categories, namely, Cepstral Coefficients
Features based defense, High-frequency Features based defense,
and Low-frequency Features based defense. We apply those defense
methods to detect both direct replay attacks and modulated replay
attacks on 6 electronic devices, and the results in Table 1 show that
our modulated replay attacks can bypass all these countermeasures.
Bypassing Cepstral Coefficients Features Based Defense. The
most popular method to detect replay attacks is based on cepstral
coefficients features extracted from the signal amplitude spectrum.
These cepstral coefficients features includes CQCC [56], MFCC [68],
LPCC [33], and MWPC [42]. Our experiments show that the ac-
curacy of detecting direct replay attacks can always achieve over
88% accuracy. However, Table 1 shows the accuracy significantly
drops to 1.80%‚àº58.56% when detecting the modulated replay audio.
The results indicate that our modulated attack can bypass existing
cepstral coefficients based detection methods.
Bypassing High-frequency Features Based Defense. As shown
in Figure 8(a) and Figure 8(b), the high-frequency spectral features
between the genuine audio and the replay audio are significantly
different. Therefore, a number of methods [27, 55, 65] detect re-
play attacks using high-frequency features, including Sub-band
Energy [27], HF-CQCC [65], and FM-AM [55]. Table 1 shows they
can achieve high accuracy on detecting the direct replay attack,
e.g., 96.43%. However, they fail to detect the modulated attack due
to frequency compensation. The highest accuracy on detecting the
modulated replay attack is only 38.74%.
Bypassing Low-frequency Features Based Defense. Besides
detection based on high-frequency features, a recent study [8] pro-
vides an effective method, i.e. Sub-bass, to detect replay attacks
based on low-frequency features. It defines a metric named energy
balance metric, which indicates the energy ratio of the sub-bass
range (20-80 Hz) to the low-frequency range (20-250 Hz). Our exper-
iments show that it can achieve 99.1% accuracy on detecting direct
replay attacks with the metric. However, the accuracy significantly
drops to less than 8% when detecting modulated replay attacks.

5.2 Effectiveness of Modulated Replay Attacks
We conduct experiments with the modulated replay attack. The
attack leverages the inverse filter to generate synthetic audio that
has a similar frequency spectrum as the genuine audio. The modu-
lated signals are generated in the Matlab environment and stored
in a lossless format. They are then transferred to replay devices for
performing attacks. Figure 8 shows the amplitude spectrum of the
signals during the modulated replay process in our experiments.
Here, the results are collected using the iPhone device, while we
have similar results with other devices. Figure 8(a) illustrates the
genuine audio that is captured directly from a live human in a
quiet room environment. The energy of genuine audio is mainly
concentrated in the low-frequency range. Figure 8(b) shows the
spectrum of the direct replay audio, which is captured from the
direct playback of the genuine audio. Due to the response prop-
erties of the speaker devices, the high-frequency components in
the direct replay audio have a higher relative proportion compared

genuine audio, which is the main difference between these two
types of audios. As we mentioned in Section 4.2, the relatively
high LER value results from the ringing artifacts in the modulated
replay audio. The results demonstrate the feasibility to detect the
modulated replay attack in the time domain with the LER patterns.
‚Ä† The parameters of the different detection methods are listed in Appendix B.
‚òÖ The first number is on direct replay attack and the second number is on modulated replay attack.
In these 8 detection methods above, MWPC performs better than
other techniques. This is because MWPC can capture partial tem-
poral information using the mel-scale Wavelet Package Transform
(WPT) [64], which handles the temporal signals on different scales.
HF-CQCC can capture the high-frequency difference in signals.
Such partial temporal information and high-frequency difference
provide more useful features for the detection of replay attacks.
Thus, MWPC and HF-CQCC perform better than other techniques.
In addition, Table 1 also shows the experimental results of the mod-
ulated replay attack with six loudspeaker devices respectively. In
theory, whatever frequency response a speaker has, we can always
find the corresponding inverse filter to counteract the effect of the
replay process. As a result, the modulated replay attack does not
depend on any specific type of speaker. The experimental results in
Table 1 validate our attack design. For any specific detection method,
the modulated replay attack exhibits similar performance when
leveraging different speaker devices. This property is critical for
real-world replay attacks, because it demonstrates the modulated
replay attack is independent of the loudspeaker. An attacker can
utilize any common speaker in our lives to perform the modulated
replay attack against ASR systems.
5.3 Effectiveness of Dual-Domain Detection
Our defense, i.e. DualGuard, contains two parts: time-domain detec-
tion and frequency-domain detection. The time-domain detection
mainly aims to identify modulated replay attacks and the frequency-
domain detection mainly aims to identify direct replay attacks. We
show the experimental results for these two parts, respectively.
Time-Domain Detection. We conduct experiments to evaluate
the accuracy for DualGuard to detect modulated replay attacks in
the time domain. As the local extrema ratio (LER) is the key feature
to detect replay attacks in the time domain, we first measure the
LER values of both modulated replay audios and genuine audios
from 6 different speaker devices.
Figure 9 illustrates the change of LER value from fine granularity
(with small window size) to coarse granularity (with large window
size). We can see that the LER decreases with the increase of the
window size. When the window size is small, the LER value of
the modulated replay audio is statistically larger than that of the
Figure 9: 20-dimensional local extrema patterns with differ-
ent granularity for genuine and modulated replay audios.
We conduct experiments to evaluate the detection accuracy in
the time domain with Algorithm 1. As shown in Figure 9, there
are no significant differences for the LERs of the genuine audio
and the modulated replay audio when the window size reaches 20.
Thus, we choose a 20-dimensional tuple {LER1, LER2, ..., LER20} in
our algorithm as the feature to detect the modulated replay attack.
Here, LERùëü denotes the LER value with the window size ùëü. The
detection accuracy of DualGuard on modulated replay attacks is
shown in Table 1. We can see that DualGuard can accurately iden-
tify modulated replay attacks in the time domain. The detection
accuracy for modulated replay attacks always exceeds 97% with
different speakers. We also calculate the false positive rate of our
method in detecting modulated replay attacks. It always maintains
less than 8% false positive rate. The results demonstrate the gen-
eralization ability of DualGuard with different speakers. Actually,
the generalization is due to the robust artifact properties in the
time-domain signals (see Appendix A). Our time-domain defense
is independent of speakers. Our main contribution of time-domain
