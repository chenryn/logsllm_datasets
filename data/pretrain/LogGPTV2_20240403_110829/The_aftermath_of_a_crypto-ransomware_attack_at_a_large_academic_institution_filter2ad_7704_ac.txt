overall satisfaction as a university community mem-
ber. Without an effective communication plan, informa-
tion may propagate informally through word-of-mouth,
which could lead to miscommunication and confusion.

Interview Methodology
We audio-recorded semi-structured interviews with 14
students, 13 staff, and 3 faculty members (n = 30). We
recruited as widely as possible, making sure to reach fac-
ulty, staff, and students across the entire campus through
appropriate mailing lists, social media posts, and posters.
From all who came forward, we interviewed all faculty,
staff, and students who were directly affected. We also
interviewed several users who were indirectly affected
until we were repeatedly hearing very similar responses.
Seven respondents had a technical background.
Inter-
views were conducted in-person in a private area on cam-

tudes and experiences with the attack, and changes in
their security practices following the incident. The in-
terview guide is available in Appendix A. Interviews
lasted approximately one hour each and interviewees
were compensated $20. The research team transcribed
the audio recordings. We omitted all identifying infor-
mation (e.g., names, department) from the transcriptions,
and assigned anonymous usernames. Interviewee user-
names contain a letter identifying the interviewee’s role
within the university (F = faculty, S = staff, G = grad-
uate student, U = undergraduate student) followed by a
randomly allocated sequential number (e.g., F2, S11).
We used inductive thematic analysis [6] to analyze the
interview data, similar to prior qualitative studies in this
area [13, 39, 42, 43]. The ﬁrst author conducted open-
ing coding of the transcripts using ATLAS.ti, generat-
ing on average 40 noteworthy excerpts per transcript and
an initial list of 146 codes. To facilitate analysis, codes
were organized into 25 categories describing common-
alities between codes. For example, 5 codes that de-
scribed interviewees’ worries, such as missing deadlines,
infecting computers, deleting data, stealing information,
and safety were categorized as ‘fears’. Two researchers
worked to reﬁne and merge codes, resulting in a ﬁnal
list of 137 codes. To increase the reliability of the anal-
ysis, the second researcher conducted open coding in-
dependently for 30% of the transcripts (i.e., 10 partic-
ipants, distributed across different demographics) using
the established code list. A Cohen’s Kappa (k) test found
good agreement between the two researchers’ analysis,
k = 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.85), p < 0.005. The two re-
searchers met to resolve any disagreements, coming up
with a mutually agreeable set of codes for the excerpts.
Following this process, the ﬁrst researcher independently
veriﬁed the remaining excerpts following the collabora-
tively established codebook. From these, main themes
were extracted along with representative quotes.

Interview Results
The interviews offered opportunity for more in-depth ex-
ploration of the issues mentioned in the surveys. We
present the results organized by general theme, aligning
with the survey where appropriate for easier comparison.
Impact
7.1
Our interviewees’ accounts of the impact of the ran-
somware attack on individuals were both technological
(e.g., blocking access to email) and emotional (e.g., caus-
ing stress). We identify the loss of access to resources
(technological), productivity, and morale (personal and
social) as the three overarching effects of the attack.
7.1.1 Technological Impact
Individuals with infected computers obviously felt the
largest impact and describe the helplessness experienced
at the inability to access any of their data. According to
one graduate student, all 14 computers in their research
lab were infected. Attempts to access ﬁles on the infected
computers led to the infuriating ransom message “we can
help” (G1). A faculty member describes his reaction at
seeing years of work become inaccessible:
F3: [I had] all my work [on Dropbox], about ﬁf-
teen years of work, and I was trying to get on
with grading and stuff and I couldn’t because they
were all encrypted. It slowly started turning all
the ﬁles into encrypted ﬁles at home as well. Then
I realized this thing was not going to stop [...].
Interestingly, the impact for many people resulted as
much from the emergency measures necessary contain
the infection as the actual attack. “Pretty much every-
one was impacted in some way [...] whether it’s being
not able to use a computer or not being able to use some
service”, explained an IT staff (S14). Interviewees iden-
tiﬁed that inability to access ﬁles, WI-FI, and the univer-
sity’s online resources such as the student learning and
management systems and email servers were the worse
consequences. Many lost their primary means of com-
munication both internally and with the outside world
(who were unaware that their email messages were not
received); others could not ﬁnd alternate contact infor-
mation for university members because it was posted on
inaccessible services (e.g., university website).
The incident was “really messy for students [because]
it was the ﬁnal week before exams, and everyone was
trying to submit their ﬁnal assignments” (S6). A student
added, “ﬁrst, I needed the Internet to enter the database
of the library to work on my paper. Second, we needed
to submit online. Both of them were a problem” (U6). A
staff from student services believed that “students were
deeply affected.” Scholarship applications were due, and
“they weren’t able to get transcripts [...]. We were try-
ing to get all of these ﬁles together for students, and we
couldn’t get anything” (S2). Similarly for other staff, “all
the ﬁles that were regularly used. . . were inaccessible”
(S14). A faculty recounted, “I couldn’t get into any of
my work ﬁles; I couldn’t work on my lecture; I couldn’t
do my Powerpoint; I couldn’t get into email. I couldn’t
do anything at the university” (F2).
Interviewees said they lost access to both online and
ofﬂine resources, such as physical workspaces normally
reserved online. They saw “a mass exodus” on the day of
the attack due to a lack of access to necessary resources
(S11). University staff were eventually sent home and
many students left campus to work.

7.1.2 Productivity Impact
Interviewees with infected computers spent signiﬁcant
time recovering data from backups or other sources. As
a faculty described, data “had to be rescued from any
source we could ﬁnd” (F1). Interviewees retrieved data
from network backups, external backups, cloud services,
email attachments, and copies from other people. How-
ever, data recovery was neither easy nor up-to-date. For
example, infected computers were re-imaged and re-
stored from the university’s network backups, but “the
stuff stored on the network. . . was about a month old. . . ”,
said a graduate student. Additionally, “any ﬁles that were
open at the time of the backup wasn’t backed up” (G1).
Interviewees also told cautionary tales about automatic
ﬁle syncing across devices; several (G1, S11, S7, S10,
F3) described that auto-syncing/backups “turned into a
nightmare” as the infected ﬁles quickly “polluted” other
devices. In one account, a staff described a colleague’s
ordeal: “his ﬁles were corrupt on his system and that was
feeding to Dropbox and all these other people linked to
his Dropbox were getting corrupted ﬁles” (S11). Eventu-
ally, the colleague was able to recover through Dropbox.
Participants also described losses of valuable produc-
tivity tools and resources, including “all desktop short-
cuts” (S1), “400 bookmarks” (S11), and carefully drafted
email templates: “I’ve been working on [my email tem-
plates] for two years”, a staff said, “I had a reply for al-
most everything a student could ask. I had these beautiful
long emails with everything that a student could possibly
need and I lost all of it” (S2). Affected participants were
“frustrated” and “annoyed” that “there’s nothing [com-
puting services] could do” (S2) because these items were
not saved on the network backups. Weeks after the inci-
dent, many were still feeling the aftermath of the attack:
S1: Even now I still run into issues. . . just when I
need things, all of sudden it is not working prop-
erly. So I am still constantly calling [computing
services] and saying “Ok, I had this folder, it isn’t
there now”. There are tons of little things like
that. . . your work days are interrupted and you are
not working at the same pace or being able to ac-
complish as much as you’d like because you’re on
the phone for an hour with [computing services].
Several interviewees believed that the signiﬁcant loss
in productively is an under-estimated impact of ran-
somware infections. A staff argued, the attack “cost the
university in lost productivity far more than they could
have paid out for ransom” (S3). Productivity costs “may
be invisible in a university”, said a faculty, but they
are nevertheless big costs (F1) which included delays
in research outcomes. As another example, a second
faculty (F2) describes losing all teaching materials for
the upcoming semester and having to spend weeks re-
developing these rather than working on an upcoming
book and research.
Even those without infected computers suffered loss
of productivity. Many interviewees said they lost at least
several days to a week of productivity during “one of
the busiest months of the year” (S2). The attack “de-
layed every due date”, and it was “really tough to catch
up (S2). A direct impact was the inability “to do our
jobs without having connectivity to the Internet and all
the applications that [the university] uses and subscribes
to” (S9). With no instructions of what to do, staff “kept
their front lines open” (S8), but others describe idle time
since they could not accomplish any of their regular tasks
(S2, S4, S8); we were basically “paralyzed”, said an-
other (S9). Students similarly described an inability to
complete homework, collaborate, and study in the days
prior to exams (e.g., “One of my classes was online, so I
wasn’t able to watch the lectures” (U4)).
7.1.3 Personal and Social Impact
Interviewees described the personal and social effects of
the experience that led to poor morale within the commu-
nity. Words such as “stressed”, “frustrated”, “anxious”,
“scared”, and “panicked” ran repeatedly throughout in-
terviewees’ accounts of their experiences. “A lot of peo-
ple were stressed and frustrated”, said a student, “people
were fuming a little bit, especially people who were rely-
ing on the [school] computers and weren’t able to access
those resources” (U8). Similarly, a staff felt “frustrated”
because “everything is broken” (S7). Another intervie-
wee described how it left them shaken:
S2: I would say it was an eye-opener, [...], know-
ing that we are really not safe, you know. All
of the information that we have online, and this
is my ﬁrst experience ever being hacked or hav-
ing anything sort of personally taken from me by
hackers [...] it was just an awakening of sorts [...]
And I never felt that before, I never had any con-
cern before, [...] and now I’m nervous, honestly.
To be honest, I’m nervous.
It’s made me more
cautions and more nervous.
Emotional toll: Many interviewees reported strong
negative feelings about the experience, but also no-
ticed a discrepancy between their emotional response
and the actual impact of the attack on their data.
In
our sample, severe data loss (i.e., signiﬁcant amounts of
work/research data permanently lost) was less common
than recoverable data loss or no data loss. A student re-
ported, “my feelings were more than severe, but in re-
ality, I didn’t see something severe,” and “I didn’t lose
anything” (U6). In other words, many interviewees re-
1068    27th USENIX Security Symposium

called their emotional response as “severe in feelings”’,
but that the attack was “not severe in reality” because it
did not affect their personal data or computers (U6).
Other than fears of direct data loss, participants feared
that the malware might damage personal computers,
cause missed deadlines, and compromise personal or ﬁ-
nancial information. For example, a staff who is also
a parent asked her child to avoid logging on to univer-
sity systems because “I don’t want to be in a situation
where I have to replace a ﬁve thousand dollar MacBook
or something. I’m like, “I don’t want you to get some
contamination and bring it home.”(S4)
Some said that they felt unsafe on campus: “I was
afraid to come to the university. . . ”, said a student, “so I
decided to leave the university and escaped to Starbucks”
(U6). Others coped by staying off the school network and
WI-FI, and incurred ﬁnancial costs by using their mobile
data to access the Internet instead. International students
were particularly impacted by the loss of connectivity
because they were unable to talk to their families back
home. One student explained,
U5: I have a lot of international friends and most
of them were actually very very homesick. Es-
pecially since exams are coming they were very
stressed out and I know a lot of them are con-
stantly talking to their parents 24/7. And because
they were unable to talk, they were very desperate
and it made them turn on [mobile] data. Like they
don’t really have it, then they would still start us-
ing it and that is when they are indirectly losing
money. . . and they’re getting stressed out.
This account highlights some personal and social im-
pacts of cyber-attacks. Users faced emotional costs at be-
ing isolated from their social support network and were
additionally stressed by indirect ﬁnancial costs.
Another emotional impact was the fear of being pe-
nalized for missing deadlines. This clearly impacted stu-
dents: “We had a paper due and everyone couldn’t ac-
cess their papers, so everyone was freaking out in my
program” (U10). Even though most students received
extensions, the process was stressful. One undergraduate
student explained, “it impacted everyone, like ‘panick-
