ABSTRACT
The need for privacy-aware policies, regulations, and tech-
niques has been widely recognized. This workshop discusses
the problems of privacy in the global interconnected soci-
eties and possible solutions. The 2012 Workshop, held in
conjunction with the ACM CCS conference, is the eleventh
in a yearly forum for papers on all the diﬀerent aspects of
privacy in today’s electronic society.
Categories and Subject Descriptors
K.4.1 [Computers and Society]: Public Policy Issues—
Privacy; K.6.m [Management of Computing and In-
formation Systems]: Miscellaneous—Security
General Terms
Algorithms, Design, Human Factors, Legal Aspects, Mea-
surement, Security
Keywords
Privacy
1. SCOPE
An ever-growing portion of our daily activities are inter-
mediated by computers, giving rise to a plethora of potential
privacy issues. It is becoming easier to collect, exchange, ac-
cess, process, and link information. Privacy issues have been
the subject of public debates, and the need for privacy-aware
policies, regulations, and techniques has been widely recog-
nized.
Since the workshop’s inception in 2002, it has sought to
bring together researchers from academia and industry to
discuss all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic pri-
vacy, as well as experimental studies of ﬁelded systems. Dur-
ing this time, privacy-related research has seen tremendous
growth and can be found in premiere conferences across a
diverse set of areas, from databases to networking to cyber-
physical systems. The workshop takes a cross-cutting ap-
proach to privacy, bringing people from various communi-
ties together and in addition presenting perspectives from
the ﬁelds of policy, law, and business on technological is-
sues.
This year, submissions were solicited on the following top-

2. PAPERS
The workshop received 48 submissions, of which 47 were
found to be in compliance with the CFP. The program com-
mittee selected 11 papers for full presentation; additionally,
3 papers were selected for short presentation. The goal was
to balance the goals of selecting high-quality contributions
and allowing the presentation of early innovative ideas that
would elicit discussion and further research. The accepted
papers cover a diverse set of topics. Anonymous communi-
cations are a traditional topic for WPES and the program
contains 3 papers on the subject. Online behavioral adver-
tising has received a lot of recent attention due to concerns
about user tracking and the corresponding privacy impact; 3
papers in the program address various aspects of this prob-
lem. Another key privacy issue is ensuring that users’ pri-
vacy expectations are met; the workshop contains papers
that study users expectations, evaluate the usability of tools,
highlight privacy risks, and help users make sense of poli-
cies. Finally, several papers propose new privacy enhancing
technologies that enable privacy-preserving genomic tests,
allow old data to disappear from the Internet, facilitate cir-
cumvention of censorship, and protects sensitive text from
automated analysis.
2.1 Ethics
This year, the committee had to struggle with the issue
of research ethics in considering a paper that collected po-
tentially sensitive user data. Although ethical treatment
of research subjects is a well-explored topic in medical re-
search, it is a relatively new concern in the computational
sciences. In our quest to better understand computer sys-
tems, we often gather data that puts users’ privacy at risk.
The last few years have seen a growing amount of atten-
tion devoted to research ethics, with position papers [1, 2],
panel discussions, and entire workshops held on the topic1.
As a workshop focused on privacy, the committee felt that
WPES should maintain high standards of publication and
require that research follow the principles of risk minimiza-
tion, beneﬁcence, and informed consent. We felt that the
paper did not suﬃciently adhere to these principles and did
not accept it into the program. The committee also felt
that it is important to continue the research ethics conver-
sation within our community by discussing ethics issues at
the workshop and possibly including some guidelines for re-
searchers in future years’ calls for papers.
