ABSTRACT
In addition to storing a plethora of sensitive personal and work
information, smartphones also store sensor data about users and
their daily activities. In order to understand users’ behaviors and
attitudes towards the security of their smartphone data, we con-
ducted 28 qualitative interviews. We examined why users choose
(or choose not) to employ locking mechanisms (e.g., PINs) and
their perceptions and awareness about the sensitivity of the data
stored on their devices. We performed two additional online exper-
iments to quantify our interview results and the extent to which sen-
sitive data could be found in a user’s smartphone-accessible email
archive. We observed a strong correlation between use of secu-
rity features and risk perceptions, which indicates rational behav-
ior. However, we also observed that most users likely underesti-
mate the extent to which data stored on their smartphones pervades
their identities, online and ofﬂine.

INTRODUCTION
As of 2013, over 90% of Americans claimed to own mobile
phones, the majority of whom use their devices to access the Inter-
net, check email, or use third party applications [15]. This means
that they trust their devices to store and access large amounts of
sensitive data, ranging from contacts to ﬁnancial details (indeed
35% use their devices for online banking [17]). At the same time,

these devices are prone to loss: a 2012 report by the Pew Internet
Project estimated that nearly a third of cell phone users have had
a device lost or stolen [8]. Lookout estimates that this comes at a
cost of $30 billion per year [26].
The cost of losing a smartphone is more than simply the replace-
ment cost of the hardware, as the data that can be found on the
device is likely to be sensitive. Symantec performed an experiment
by intentionally “losing” 50 smartphones in ﬁve major cities and
observed that while 96% of the devices had their data examined
by those who found them, only 50% of the ﬁnders attempted to
return the devices [39]. Yet, despite these risks, previous research
suggests that 35% of smartphone users do not lock their devices to
prevent unauthorized persons from using them [36].
We performed qualitative interviews to understand users’ moti-
vations for choosing whether or not to lock their devices. Of our
28 participants, we observed that 29% (8 of 28) did not lock their
devices. Their top reasons included concerns about emergency per-
sonnel not being able to identify them, not having their devices
returned if lost, and not believing they had any data worth protect-
ing. An online survey of 2,518 smartphone users corroborated our
ﬁndings. We suggest that many concerns that prevent users from
locking their phones can be alleviated by simple design changes.
Finally, we performed an online experiment to evaluate whether
participants’ beliefs about the lack of sensitive data on their devices
were well-founded. We noted that all of our interview participants
used their devices to access their email accounts, without requir-
ing additional authentication. In our online experiment, we found
that of our 995 participants, many reported ﬁnding their social se-
curity numbers (20%), credit/debit card numbers (16 and 17%, re-
spectively), bank account numbers (26%), birth dates (46%), email
passwords (30%), and/or home addresses (76%) stored in their email
accounts. Yet, the presence of this data correlated with locking be-
haviors, suggests that some users may be making rational decisions
to not lock their devices.
We contribute the following:
• We qualitatively show why users choose or choose not to
lock their smartphones and quantify the prevalence of these
rationales among the smartphone-owning U.S. population.
• We discuss how these ﬁndings can be used to improve mobile
• Our studies suggest that access to email is a seriously un-
derestimated threat to personal information. We attempt to
quantify the likelihood of ﬁnding different types of sensitive
information in an email account.
security and the user experience.
2. RELATED WORK
In this section we discuss previous work on smartphone locking
methods, alternatives to the existing mechanisms, and users’ mo-
bile security perceptions.
2.1 Current Methods and Attacks
Despite a majority of users taking proactive steps to protect their
smartphone data, many mobile authentication mechanisms can be
defeated through relatively simple attacks. For instance, the un-
lock codes chosen by users are often relatively predictable and can
therefore be determined by simple guessing [7, 1, 35, 40]. Other
threats investigated in the literature include shoulder-surﬁng [14,
13], inference based on smudge patterns left on the screen [3, 38],
or malicious applications that abuse access to the device’s sensors
to infer the user’s unlock code [4, 32]. While these attacks could
pose a threat in certain speciﬁc situations, we suspect they have
limited relevance to most users’ everyday use of their phones.
Regarding common smartphone security behaviors, van Bruggen
et al. studied the adoption of smartphone locking methods among
Android users [36]. They observed that while 35% of their partici-
pants did not lock their devices, those who did were split three-to-
one in favor of Android’s pattern unlock feature over entering a nu-
meric PIN. von Zezschwitz et al. found that users perceive the pat-
tern unlock as being quicker and less error-prone than PINs, though
their quantitative data showed that reality is just the opposite: PIN
entry is both less error prone and quicker [37].
The most relevant work to our study was performed by Harbach
et al. [21]. They surveyed online participants about locking behav-
iors and risk perceptions. They followed this up with a month-long
experience sampling experiment in which ﬁeld participants were
periodically asked to report on the likelihood of someone shoulder
surﬁng when they unlocked their phones. Our work differs from
theirs in that they performed an in-depth quantitative study of the
likelihood of a particular threat model, whereas we examine the
magnitude of harm stemming from a broad range of threat models
by comparing participants’ perceptions with the sensitivity of the
data actually stored on their mobile devices. Thus, we believe our
studies are complementary as together they provide a detailed as-
sessment of smartphone risks stemming from unauthorized access;
“a complete assessment of risk requires that the potential effects of
[a risk] be combined with the probability of occurrence” [33].
2.2 Alternative Mechanisms
Today’s mobile phones use a locked/unlocked security model
that was designed when the data stored on phones was limited to
call histories and the names and phone numbers of contacts. Cur-
rently, smartphone locking mechanisms prevent access to almost
all device functionality (with some exceptions, such as answering
calls, making emergency calls, or taking photos) when the device
is locked. Hayashi et al. investigated how well this two-state ac-
cess control model meets users’ needs and preferences, as well as
how receptive users would be to alternate ﬁne-grained access con-
trol policies and authentication mechanisms [22]. Most of their
participants wanted at least half of their applications to be accessi-
ble without requiring an unlock code, which suggests opportunities
for improving current locking mechanisms. Interestingly, partici-
pants wanted apps that contained personal data to be unavailable
when the device is locked, even though this included their most
frequently used applications (e.g., email).
As an alternative to the standard all-or-nothing smartphone ac-
cess control approach, Riva et al. proposed progressive authenti-
cation [27]. Using a variety of heuristics, their system determines
a level of conﬁdence in a user’s authenticity. It then determines
whether to require authentication based on the conﬁdence level and
the degree of protection the user had speciﬁed for each application.
Their system reduced the frequency with which users needed to
authenticate by 42% while still maintaining acceptable security.
Other researchers have proposed alternative authentication mech-
anisms that aim to increase usability so that more users will choose
to lock their devices. Takada and Kokubun suggested minor modiﬁ-
cations to the PIN entry mechanisms that could result in signiﬁcant
security gains at little usability cost [34]. Many researchers have
compared different types of graphical authentication mechanisms
to show that there are many viable alternatives to the standard PIN
or pattern approach [6, 10, 29]. Dunphy et al. showed that many
of the concerns preventing these graphical authentication systems
from being adopted are unfounded [16]. Others have proposed in-
creasing the security of gesture-based authentication mechanisms
on mobile devices by linking them to biometrics [28, 12]. For in-
stance, Frank et al. showed that an individual’s gesture style could
be used as a secondary authentication heuristic [18]. However, Ser-
wadda and Phoha showed that gesture styles could be observed and
replicated automatically [31].
2.3 User Perceptions and Behaviors
Chin et al. showed that many users are apprehensive about per-
forming private and/or ﬁnancially-sensitive tasks on their phones,
primarily because of fear of theft, mistrust of smartphone applica-
tions, and unfamiliarity with security features like remote wipe [11].
Chin et al. also showed that users are more concerned about pri-
vacy on their phones than on their laptops. Becher et al. provide
an overview of how security actually differs between mobile and
desktop devices [5].
Many smartphone users balance privacy concerns with the desire
to share their devices with others [22, 20]. Karlson et al. showed
that it is common for users to share their phones with up to 11 dif-
ferent people, despite these concerns [25]. They found that many
users are uncomfortable with guests having access to personal in-
formation such as voicemail, notes, ﬁles, email, SMS, and calen-
dars. However, some users may forgo locking their devices in order
to be able to easily share their devices with those close to them.
Despite research on the security, usability (i.e., false rejection
rate and time to authenticate), and vulnerabilities of smartphone
authentication mechanisms, we are unaware of prior work that has
qualitatively explored why people lock their smartphones. We are
also unaware of work that has examined users’ perceptions about
the sensitivity of the data stored on their phones vis à vis reality.
This research is necessary because it helps us to better understand
why some users may abstain from locking their phones, whether
they are rational in doing so, and how system designs can encour-
age better security behaviors.
3. METHODOLOGY
We performed structured interviews of 28 participants to gain
qualitative insights into the locking behaviors of smartphone users.
We used a grounded theory approach to understand why people
choose (or choose not) to lock their smartphones [19], and then
we quantiﬁed these results by performing a follow-up survey us-
ing 2,518 Google Consumer Survey (GCS) participants. Finally,
to compare participants’ risk perceptions with actual risks, we per-
formed a third online experiment with 995 Amazon Mechanical
Turk workers to measure the frequency with which different types
of sensitive information are stored in email (and therefore could be
accessed on an unlocked smartphone). In this section we describe
our recruiting method and procedure for the initial interviews.

3.1 Recruitment
We placed an online recruitment advertisement on Craigslist in
January of 2014, under the Bay Area “et cetera jobs” section. The
title of the advertisement was, “smartphone owners - participate in
a study,” and it stated that the study was about how people use their
smartphones (the exact wording is presented in Appendix A). We
intentionally made no mention of locking or security, in order to not
prime them. Those interested in participating ﬁlled out an online
screening survey in which they provided information about their
age, gender, smartphone make and model, amount of time using
a smartphone, contact information, and availability. We screened
out those who were under 18 years of age or who had been using a
smartphone for under six months.
We contacted participants who met our screening qualiﬁcations
by email to schedule a time for them to visit our “laboratory” (i.e.,
a nearby coffee shop). We recruited 28 participants in this manner
and instructed them to bring their smartphones with them, as they
would be answering questions about how they use them. Partici-
pants showed up for individual sessions that lasted between 30 and
60 minutes. At the end of each session, we provided each partici-
pant with a $35 debit card.
Of our 28 participants, exactly half were male, and ages ranged
from 20 to 53 years old (µ = 31, σ = 9.6). Eleven were Android
users (39%), whereas the rest were iPhone users. While all par-
ticipants had owned a smartphone for over six months, the length
of ownership for their current devices ranged from 2 months to 3.5
years (µ = 16 months, σ = 9.1). Thus, the vast majority of our
participants had owned a previous smartphone (68% of 28).
3.2 Procedure
Each interview session took place in our “laboratory” with one
participant and two researchers. One researcher, the interviewer,
asked questions from a pre-determined list (i.e., structured inter-
views), while the other researcher took detailed notes. Both re-
searchers were able to ask follow-up questions or clariﬁcations if
a participant’s responses were unclear. After arriving, the partic-
ipant read and signed a consent form. Next, the interviewer ex-
plained that the purpose of the interview was to better understand
how participants interacted with their smartphones. Again, to avoid
priming, the security focus of the interview was not revealed until
towards the end, and even then, it was never made explicit. Our
questions fell into the following categories:
1. Background and General Usage: In the ﬁrst part of the in-
terviews, we asked participants to describe their smartphones
and the other computing devices that they regularly used. For
example, “What is the make and model of your current smart-
phone?,” “For how long have you been using this smart-
phone?,” and “Do you use a tablet, laptop, or desktop com-
puter?.” We also asked about the primary purpose of each
device (i.e., whether it is for personal or professional use).
2. Smartphone Apps and Accounts: Participants listed all third-
party applications installed on their smartphones. Next, we
asked them to describe the ones that they used most fre-
quently, speciﬁcally whether any of these applications have
user accounts associated with them, and whether those ac-
count credentials are saved on the phone or need to be en-
tered with each use. We prompted participants to describe
their use of applications in a few special categories: ﬁnan-
