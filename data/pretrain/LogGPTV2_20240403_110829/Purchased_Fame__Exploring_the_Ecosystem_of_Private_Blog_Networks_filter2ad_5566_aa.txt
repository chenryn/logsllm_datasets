### Abstract
Many online browsing sessions begin with users entering relevant keywords into a popular search engine. The websites that users ultimately visit are often determined by their position in the search results. Although the proprietary ranking algorithms used by search engines are not well understood, it is widely believed that incoming links play a significant role in determining a website's rank. This has led to the development of various black-hat SEO techniques aimed at deceiving search engines to promote specific websites.

In this paper, we present the first extensive study on the ecosystem of a novel type of black-hat SEO: the trade of artificially created backlinks through private blog networks (PBNs). Our study is three-pronged: 
1. We perform an exploratory analysis to capture intrinsic information about the ecosystem and measure the effectiveness of backlinks, demonstrating that PBNs can be highly effective in promoting websites.
2. We develop and present an ML-driven methodology that detects PBN sites with 98.7% accuracy using content-based and linking-based features.
3. In a large-scale experiment involving over 50,000 websites, we expose extensive networks of backlink operations, identifying thousands of websites engaged in PBNs.

## 1. Introduction
Every second, users enter more than 60,000 search queries on Google [7]. According to a study by Advanced Web Ranking [20], in more than half of these cases, users click on one of the first three results. As search engines are a critical driver of organic traffic, being ranked higher than similar businesses can provide significant competitive advantages. The high prices for Search Ads, which can cost more than $50 per click [32], highlight the monetary incentive to achieve high search rankings.

Numerous black-hat SEO techniques have been developed to improve a website's rank. For example, overloading a page with related keywords can manipulate the relevance score of the search algorithm [19], or low-quality websites filled with malicious content or advertisements can be ranked for trending search terms [16]. However, as detection of SEO abuse improves [23, 26], many black-hat SEO techniques have become less effective.

The ongoing arms race between search engines and those attempting to artificially boost their website's rank has led to the evolution of black-hat SEO techniques. In this paper, we explore the infrastructure of a relatively new technique called private blog networks (PBNs). Unlike traditional methods that exploit single aspects of ranking algorithms, PBNs leverage the intended operation of these algorithms, promoting websites with links from legitimate, trustworthy sources. PBN operators set up networks of purposefully created, seemingly legitimate websites.

To analyze the different actors in this ecosystem, we developed a multi-step machine learning classifier that uses both content-based and linking-based features, achieving 98.7% accuracy. In a large-scale experiment involving 52,777 websites, our classifier detected 3,552 PBN sites. We also studied PBN customers and found that the decision to purchase backlinks is often financially motivated, either to promote a business or to drive more users to websites generating revenue through advertisements. Despite efforts by PBN providers to hide their networks, we detected several clusters, ranging from a few websites to several hundred controlled by a single entity. We conclude that the backlink ecosystem is highly lucrative, with providers generating over $100,000 per month and customers attracting more visitors at the expense of their competitors.

In summary, our contributions include:
- The first comprehensive study of the PBN ecosystem, identifying involved entities and analyzing their interactions.
- A novel, multi-step machine learning methodology to detect PBNs and associate domains with high accuracy.
- A large-scale scan of over 50,000 websites, discovering thousands of domains aiming to boost their customers' reputations and clustering several networks.
- Insights into the measures PBN providers must take to avoid detection as search engines continuously improve their backlink abuse detection techniques.

## 2. Exploratory Analysis
To evaluate the current state-of-practice of SEO abuse, we conducted an exploratory experiment focusing on a novel black-hat SEO technique: private blog networks (PBNs).

### 2.1 Experimental Setup
We began by investigating the types of backlink services currently available. We searched for backlink-related phrases such as "buy backlinks" and "improve SEO ranking" and analyzed the most prominent results. Additionally, we evaluated backlink packages offered on specialized marketplaces like SEOClerks [24] and KonKer [9]. While most services specify the number of links, few reveal the techniques used to create them. To gain deeper insights, we purchased several representative backlink services and followed the process outlined in Figure 1. We purchased 12 backlink services across three price ranges: low-end ($6), mid-end ($24-30), and high-end ($59-86).

After purchasing the backlink services, we provided the target URLs and related keywords for the promoted websites. We set up 12 test websites by registering recently expired domain names and serving prior versions of the websites obtained from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Reviving expired websites served two purposes: it created legitimate-looking sites, preventing providers from detecting the analysis, and it reduced potential bias, as search engines may treat new and existing websites differently. To further minimize the impact of domain ownership changes, the websites remained idle (no content added or modified) for at least four months before any backlink service was purchased.

### 2.2 Backlink Creation
Once the backlinks were created, the provider reported the completion of the service, typically including a list of pages containing links back to the customer's domain. This allowed us to verify the fulfillment of the order. Table 1 summarizes the number of links delivered by each provider. By manually inspecting these links, we classified the types of backlinks created. Cheaper services primarily created backlinks on existing websites by creating fake profiles and adding links in the profile section. More expensive services created links on their PBNs, which are networks of websites specifically used to boost their customers' rankings. These PBNs are structured as blogs, with each newly created link associated with a blog post entry containing several hundred words of content related to the linked website.

### 2.3 Backlink Effectiveness
To assess the effectiveness of backlinks in promoting websites, we monitored various heuristics reflecting a domain's reputation daily throughout the experiment. Specifically, we obtained backlinks and Domain Authority scores from Moz [17], which predict how well a website ranks in search results [18]. From Majestic [15], we obtained Citation Flow and Trust Flow metrics. Citation Flow, ranging from 0 to 100, reflects the "power" of a link from a given website, while Trust Flow indicates the quality of a particular website, increasing when trusted sites link to it.

While these metrics aim to represent the ranking algorithms used by search engines, discrepancies can occur, especially under manipulation. Since popular search engines no longer provide ranking scores or metrics [28], we evaluated the direct difference in ranking for relevant keywords. For each test website, we composed three relevant queries and queried Google and Bing daily, recording the top 50 results. We cleared browser cookies before each query and ensured consistent geographical location to avoid bias.
