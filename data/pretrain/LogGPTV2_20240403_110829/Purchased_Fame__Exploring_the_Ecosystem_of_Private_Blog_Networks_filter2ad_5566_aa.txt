ABSTRACT
For many, a browsing session starts by entering relevant keywords
in a popular search engine. The websites that users thereafter land
on are often determined by their position in the search results.
Although little is known about the proprietary ranking algorithms
employed by popular search engines, it is strongly suspected that
the incoming links have a significant influence on the outcome.
This has lead to the inception of various black-hat SEO techniques
that aim to deceive search engines to promote a specific website.
In this paper, we present the first extensive study on the ecosys-
tem of a novel type of black-hat SEO, namely the trade of artificially
created backlinks through private blog networks (PBNs). Our study
is three-pronged: first, we perform an exploratory analysis, through
which we capture intrinsic information of the ecosystem and mea-
sure the effectiveness of backlinks, showing that in several cases
this technique can be highly effective at promoting a website. Next,
we develop and present an ML-driven methodology that detects
PBN sites with an accuracy of 98.7% by leveraging various content-
based and linking-based features intrinsic to the operation of the
ecosystem. Finally, in a large-scale experiment involving more than
50,000 websites, we expose large networks of backlink operations,
finding thousands of websites engaged in PBNs.

Every second, users enter more than 60,000 search queries on
Google [7]. In more than half of the cases, users click through
to one of the first three results that are returned, according to a
study by Advanced Web Ranking [20]. As search engines are one

similar businesses can provide significant competitive advantages.
The prices for Search Ads, advertisements that are shown on top
of the result pages and may cost more than $50 per click [32], are
indicative of the monetary incentive to score high in search results.
There exist numerous black-hat SEO techniques that can be lever-
aged to improve the rank of a website. For instance, by overloading
a page with related keywords, the relevance score of the search algo-
rithm can be manipulated [19], or by ranking low-quality websites,
often filled with malicious content or bloated with advertisements,
for trending search-terms [16]. As a result of the continuously im-
proving detection of SEO abuse [23, 26], many of the black-hat SEO
techniques are rendered mostly ineffective.
As a consequence of this ongoing arms-race between search
engines and miscreants who try to artificially boost their websites
higher in the search results, the black-hat SEO techniques keep
evolving. In this paper, we explore the underlying infrastructure of a
relatively new technique, called private blog networks (PBNs), that
shows a change in the paradigm of SEO abuse: instead of exploiting
single aspects of the ranking algorithms, PBNs leverage the way
these algorithms are intended to operate, i.e. promoting websites
with links originating from legitimate, trustworthy sources. To this
extent, PBN operators set up networks consisting of websites that
are purposefully created to appear legitimate.
To analyze the different actors in this ecosystem, we develop a
multi-step machine learning classifier that leverages both content-
based and linking-based features inherent to the operations of PBNs
with an accuracy of 98.7%. As part of a large-scale experiment on
52,777 websites, our classifier manages to detect 3,552 PBN sites.
Furthermore, we study the PBN customers and find that the deci-
sion to purchase backlinks is often financially motivated, either to
promote a business or to drive more users to websites that gener-
ate money through advertisements. Finally, despite the efforts of
PBN providers to hide their network, we manage to detect several
clusters, ranging from a handful of websites to several hundred
websites that are controlled by a single entity. We conclude that
the backlink ecosystem is highly lucrative both for the providers,
who can generate a turnover of more than $100,000 per month, as
well as for their customers, who can attract many more visitors to
their websites at the expense of their competitors.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We perform the first comprehensive study of the ecosystem
of artificially created backlinks on PBNs, identifying the
involved entities and analyzing their interactions.
• We develop a novel methodology driven by a multi-step
machine learning algorithm that can be used to detect PBNs
and associate the involved domains with a high accuracy.
• Leveraging this method, we perform a large-scale scan on
more than 50,000 websites, and discover thousands of do-
mains that aim to boost the reputation of their customers.
We manage to cluster together several networks and find
that providers may employ up to several hundred websites
to promote their customers.
• As search engines are continuously improving their tech-
niques to detect backlink abuse, PBN providers have to resort
to more extensive measures to avoid detection.
2 EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
In order to evaluate the current state-of-practice of SEO abuse, we
perform an exploratory experiment and report on a novel black-hat
SEO technique named private blog networks (PBNs).
2.1 Experimental setup
As the first step of our analysis, we explored which types of back-
link services are currently provided. To this end, we searched for
backlink-related phrases such as “buy backlinks” and “improve SEO
ranking” and analyzed the most prominent results. Furthermore,
we evaluated the backlink packages that were offered on market-
places specialized in SEO techniques, such as SEOClercks [24] and
KonKer [9]. Although most services include the number of links
that would be created, only a few services reveal which technique
they use to create backlinks. To obtain more information about
the type of backlink services that are provided and gain in-depth
insights into the workings of the ecosystem, we purchased several
services that are representative of the market and followed the
process presented in Figure 1. In total, we purchased 12 backlink
services, covering three different price ranges: low-end backlinks
costing $6, mid-end backlinks that we purchased for $24-30, and,
lastly, high-end backlinks which cost $59-86.
After purchasing the backlink services, we were asked to provide
information such as the target URLs and keywords that are related
to the promoted website. To this end, we set up 12 websites, which
we created by registering recently expired domain names, and serv-
ing a prior version of the website that was obtained through Internet
Archive’s Wayback Machine. The reason for reviving expired web-
sites is twofold: first, this method yields legitimate-looking websites,
preventing the providers from discovering they are being analyzed
and second, as search engines may treat new websites differently
than existing ones, this could increase bias in our results. To further
reduce the consequences a change in domain ownership can have
on a website’s reputation, the websites remained in an idle state,
i.e. no content was added or modified, for at least 4 months before
any backlink service was purchased.
2.2 Backlink creation
As soon as the backlinks have been created, the backlink provider
reports back the completion of the service and typically includes
a list of pages that contain a link back to the customer’s domain.
This allows the customer to verify the fulfillment of the order. In
Table 1, we show the number of links that were delivered by each

backlink provider. By manually inspecting these links, we classified
the types of backlinks created. As can be seen in Table 1, the cheaper
backlink services mainly create backlinks on existing websites by
creating fake profiles and adding a link in the profile section of
each user to their client’s URL. For all other backlink services, the
providers created links on their private blog network (PBN). These
are networks of websites that are specifically used for creating
links to their customers, and thus boost their ranking. Typically,
the websites are structured as blogs, where each newly created link
is associated with a blog post entry containing several hundred
words of content related to the linked website.
2.3 Backlink effectiveness
To develop an intuition of how effective backlinks are in promot-
ing their customers, we obtained various heuristics that reflect a
domain’s reputation on a daily basis throughout the duration of
our experiment. More precisely, from the Moz service [17], we ob-
tained our test websites’ backlinks and their Domain Authority,
which is a proprietary search engine ranking score that predicts
how well a website is ranked within search results [18]. From the
Majestic service [15], we obtained the Citation Flow and Trust Flow
metrics [15]. Citation Flow ranges from 0 to 100, and reflects the
“power” of a link from any given website. In conjunction, Trust Flow
demonstrates the quality of a particular website and is increased
when trusted websites link to this domain.
While these metrics aim to represent the ranking algorithm em-
ployed by search engines, it is possible that significant discrepancies
occur, especially under the conditions of attempted manipulation.
As popular search engines no longer provide any ranking score
or metric [28], we evaluated the direct difference in ranking for

we composed three relevant queries and queried Google through
their website and Bing through their API for each query. To avoid
bias, we cleared all browser cookies before making a new query
and ensured the service was contacted from the same geographical
location over the duration of the experiment. We performed all
queries on a daily basis and recorded the top 50 results.
