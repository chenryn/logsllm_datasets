### Figures and Analysis

**Figure 5: GCC for the topologies generated by the minimax and single peak schemes via the MGM and minimax with IEM, under three values of \( k_3 \).**

- **Parameters:**

  - IEM: \(\alpha = 2\)
- **Data Points:**
  - Each data point is the average of 20 trials.
  - 95% confidence intervals are represented as vertical bars.
  - Confidence intervals for minimax under MGM are very small and may appear unnoticeable.
  - For all models, GCC is 0 at \( k_2 = 0 \).

### Discussion

The results show that topologies generated under the MGM consistently have lower average shortest paths compared to those generated under the IEM, indicating better robustness. This suggests that peak TMs (Traffic Matrices) dominate the overall topology design. The contrast between the MGM and IEM topologies is attributed to the larger peak TMs generated by the MGM. Additionally, the minimax topologies exhibit very little variation (unnoticeable 95% confidence intervals) compared to the single peak scheme.

Interestingly, COLD (a topology generator) uses a distribution of peak TMs to converge on a design that is robust to a wide range of TMs. This highlights two key lessons:

1. **PoP-level Topology Design and TMs:**
   - PoP-level topology design is largely unaffected by TMs, in line with previous research [5]. The impact of TMs is primarily through \( k_2 \), but this has a relatively minor effect. This is evident from the minimal variation in results even when the variance in the models was increased by increasing \(\sigma^2\) and \(\alpha\).
   - More extreme TMs, such as those with entries sampled from the Pareto distribution (which has heavy tails), also had little impact on topology generation [5].

2. **Importance of Peak TMs:**
   - Only peak TMs matter in improving the robustness of a network. This is consistent with standard practice, where networks are designed using peak TMs.
   - The single peak scheme was competitive with the minimax scheme, suggesting that average case TMs are not necessary. Instead, it would be more effective to use several worst-case TMs as input into the design.
   - Models with little variation, such as the IEM, are less useful in this context. In contrast, the MGM (and similarly, NCIM) generate peak TMs, making them more suitable for robust network design.

### Conclusion

Synthesizing TMs with prescribed spatiotemporal properties is a challenging problem, particularly due to the lack of publicly available data and the need for controllability in generating ensembles of TMs with specific constraints for testing network algorithms and protocols.

Our approach, based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt), allows for controlled TM properties by setting appropriate constraints while avoiding extraneous assumptions. Our models are controllable and satisfy desirable characteristics such as consistency and independence between model components. Despite their simplicity, they were able to replicate real TM characteristics, such as low-rank behavior.

We evaluated our models in the application of PoP-level network topology generation. We modified COLD to accept a series of TMs with prescribed spatiotemporal characteristics. Our findings indicate that PoP-level topology generation is largely unaffected by TMs. Additionally, only peak TMs are useful in designing networks that are robust to TM variations, supporting the common practice of using busy period TMs for topology design.

Future work will focus on developing an algorithm for sampling maximum entropy distributions with general constraints, such as correlation constraints and cyclostationarity, and studying the TMs of data centers.
