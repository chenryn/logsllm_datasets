Figure 5: GCC for the topologies generated by the minimax and single peak schemes via the MGM and minimax with IEM,
under three values of k3. The MGM has σ2 = 10−5, and the IEM has α = 2. Each data point is the average of 20 trials.
The 95% conﬁdence intervals appear as vertical bars. Conﬁdence intervals for minimax under MGM are very small that they
appear unnoticeable. For all models, GCC is 0 at k2 = 0.

Figure 6: GCC for the topologies generated by the minimax and single peak schemes via the MGM and minimax with IEM,
under three values of k3. Both models have increased variance, i.e., the MGM has σ2 = 10, and the IEM has α = 4. Each
data point is the average of 20 trials. The 95% conﬁdence intervals appear as vertical bars. Conﬁdence intervals for minimax
under MGM are very small that they appear unnoticeable. For all models, GCC is 0 at k2 = 0.
ever, topologies under the MGM consistently have lower
average shortest paths than the IEM topologies, sug-
gesting better robustness for the former.
The implication here is that peak TMs dominate the
overall topology design. The contrast between the MGM
and the IEM topologies is due to the larger peak TMs
generated by the MGM. Another highlight is that the
minimax topologies show very little variation (unnotice-
able 95% conﬁdence intervals) compared to the single
peak.
Interestingly, COLD is using a distribution of
peak TMs to converge on a design that is robust to a
much wider range of TMs.
We summarize two key lessons. First, PoP-level topol-
ogy design is largely unaﬀected by TMs, in line with the
result in [5]. TMs have an eﬀect through k2 but k2 has
relatively minor impact. This is seen through the lit-
tle variation in the results even though variance in the
models were increased by increasing σ2 and α. More
extreme TMs with entries sampled from the Pareto dis-
tribution (which has heavy tails), studied by [5], also
had little impact on topology generation.
Second, only peak TMs matter in improving the ro-
bustness of a network. This is by no means surpris-
ing, as it is standard practice to design networks using
peak TMs. As the single peak scheme was competi-
tive with the minimax scheme, average case TMs are
not required. Instead, it would be better to use several
worse case TMs as input into the design. Models with
little variation such as the IEM are not useful here, in
contrast to the MGM (and similarly, NCIM) which do
generate peak TMs.
6. CONCLUSION
Synthesis of TMs with prescribed spatiotemporal prop-
erties is a challenging problem. A big obstacle is the
lack of publicly available data for researchers. Another
590important issue is controllability, as researchers require
a way to generate ensembles of TMs with constraints to
test network algorithms and protocols.
Our approach goes back to ﬁrst principles to avoid
the measure-then-model paradigm by applying the prin-
ciple of maximum entropy. MaxEnt allows for con-
trol of the TM properties by setting appropriate con-
straints on them, while avoiding extraneous assump-
tions. Our models are controllable and satisfy several
desirable characteristics, namely consistency and inde-
pendence between model components. Despite their
simplicity, they were able to replicate characteristics of
real TMs such as low rank behavior.
We evaluated our models on an application: PoP-
level network topology generation. We modiﬁed COLD,
a topology generator, to accept a series of TMs with pre-
scribed spatiotemporal characteristics. PoP-level topol-
ogy generation turns out to be largely unaﬀected by
TMs. We also found that only peak TMs are useful in
designing networks that are robust to TM variations.
Thus, the common practice of using busy period TMs
to design topologies is an excellent strategy.
Future work will focus on developing an algorithm for
sampling maximum entropy distributions handling gen-
eral constraints e.g., correlation constraints and cyclo-
stationarity, and studying the TMs of data centers.
