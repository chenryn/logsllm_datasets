communications SOPs across the area through the TICP Implementation Workshop.  Additional steps, such 
as storing applicable SOPs with radio caches and gateways, would support the continued dissemination and 
implementation of these SOPs.  In regards to command and control procedures, the Charlotte UA has been 
implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for more 
than 1 year, allowing agencies time to develop proficiency.  During the TICP validation exercise, the 
Charlotte UA successfully demonstrated NIMS/ICS, including the Communications Unit Leader (COML) 
position that had been newly incorporated.  For example, a unified command was successfully established 
with Incident Commanders representing each of the jurisdictional agencies.  Additionally, a COML was 
designated and announced to all relevant personnel.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to maintain and update SOPs (e.g., through updates after scheduled tabletop communications 
exercises) to include policies for using new equipment, and disseminate to all included organizations 
• 
Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Charlotte UA showed success in the use of all available communications interoperability methods (e.g., 
radio caches, shared channels, gateways, shared systems) during its TICP validation exercise.  While 
interoperable communications equipment is not used on a daily basis, the Charlotte UA included all 11 
counties in successfully exercising all available interoperability equipment.  Charlotte had one of the most 
inclusive exercises with regard to the level of local agency participation.  While the exercise met the stated 
requirements, it did not provide the opportunity to demonstrate interoperable communications with federal 
agencies in the area.  The UA is encouraged to build on its local exercise success by further integrating state, 
federal, and support agencies in future events. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve public safety support disciplines, and state and federal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Charlotte UA hosts 29 separate radio systems. Radio systems supporting first responders are a mixture of very high 
frequency (VHF), ultra high frequency (UHF), and 800 megahertz (MHz) systems.  The City of Charlotte is serviced by 
the Charlotte/Mecklenburg 800 MHz Radio System, which supports public safety agencies from both the City of 
Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.  Communications interoperability is provided by the use of cached radios, 
gateways, and shared channels.  The Charlotte UA is working to incorporate Union and Gaston County into the 
Charlotte/Mecklenburg radio system.  Using the existing Charlotte/Mecklenburg Motorola SmartZone™ 4.1 zone 
controller, Charlotte/Mecklenburg intends to interconnect its 800 MHz Radio System with those owned and operated by 
Union and Gaston counties and to establish a UA shared system.

The SOSINK established a communications subcommittee under the SOSINK regional Terrorism Preparedness 
Advisory Team to create the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) in October 2005.  The committee 
includes representatives from the majority of local agencies within the UA counties.  The documentation did not 
indicate whether the group has a charter that defines the authority of the group.  The Cincinnati/Hamilton UA has 
formal mutual aid agreements among local agencies (e.g., fire, law enforcement, emergency medical services [EMS]) 
and local villages, townships, and cities.  Agreements with broader public support and state agencies are provided 
through the Ohio Response System.  The UA also lacks interstate agreements among state representatives in Ohio, 
Kentucky, and Indiana.  Considering the complex nature of coordination necessary among three states and multiple 
localities, a regional strategic plan for interoperable communications is critical to ensure regionwide interoperability, 
which currently does not exist.  The UA should consider including a longer term funding strategy that is diversified and 
sustainable, and aligns with the UA’s interoperable communications needs.  Currently, the UA receives funding from 
federal grants to fund the regional system.  The UA’s leadership has demonstrated the importance of interoperable 
communications by allocating a large portion of acquired federal grant funding to communications interoperability 
equipment in addition to substantial local funds.  However, there is no specified strategy to ensure sustained funding for 
interoperability needs.  Despite the success of the area’s leadership, fiscal and political support dedicated to tri-state 
interoperability is an issue that calls for ongoing, enhanced coordination.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to involve state and federal organizations (e.g., Kentucky and Indiana State Police, Federal Bureau of 
Investigation) in the committee, develop a charter to establish roles, responsibilities, and authority  
• 
Continue to document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating 
agencies (e.g., interstate agreements among Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana) to support partnership on regional 
interoperability, allocate resources to complete the formalize agreements, and renew effort to increase involvement 
among all appropriate local, state, and federal agencies, particularly law enforcement 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a consensus tri-state regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of 
the TICP) with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance; align local and statewide strategic planning efforts 
to ensure that tri-state regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop and implement a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) interoperability planning and 
sustainable funding (in addition to grants) 
• 
Continue to identify a champion(s) from each of the states to establish a governance structure that more fully 
supports a unified tri-state regional approach to planning, policy, and operations

toward implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS), and 
SOSINK is assisting in the delivery of NIMS/ICS training.  The Cincinnati/Hamilton UA demonstrated familiarity with 
command and control communications during the TICP validation exercise, and requires continued training for 
proficiency in some command and control procedures as documented in the TICP validation exercise (e.g., incident and 
unified commands were established but not in a timely manner, a Communications Unit Leader was designated, but not 
announced to exercise participants). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to develop tri-state regional interoperability SOPs consistent with the TICP, further disseminate 
throughout UA (in addition to storing radio cache SOPs with cache), and train all participating agencies 
• 
Continue to involve additional state and federal agencies in development of tri-state Regional SOPs 
• 
Identify the title and source documentation for existing SOPs in the TICP

The Cincinnati/Hamilton UA regularly uses a shared system that provides communications interoperability across 4 of 
the 8 Ohio counties in the area and among counties in Kentucky and Indiana.  Officials indicated that there historically 
had not been a need for interoperable communications among all 12 counties in the UA.  Although the UA does not 
regularly use its interoperable communications equipment across all 12 counties, it elected to pursue a complicated 
TICP validation exercise that stressed its interoperability capabilities so that it could positively identify areas for 
improvement.  During the TICP validation exercise, some of the types of solutions presented difficulty for the UA in 
terms of demonstrating familiarity and proficient use (e.g., distributed radio cache without training or instructions).  
Despite issues with the radio caches, the Cincinnati/Hamilton UA was able to demonstrate familiarity with other 
available interoperability equipment, including shared channels and gateways. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to regularly test and exercise deployment of Regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
(e.g., radio cache and gateways) 
• 
Continue to practice multijurisdictional and multidiscipline communications during future exercises and day-to-day 
activities, and include all 12 counties 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of future exercises in the tri-state area

The Cuyahoga County Emergency Services Advisory Board has an informal communications subcommittee 
addressing interoperability that consists of regional fire, law enforcement, and public health representatives 
on an ad hoc basis.  Currently, there are no published and active agreements among the regional agencies, 
although the UA plans to implement the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) as the area’s 
first formal agreement once it is adopted by participating agencies.  The decision-making group informally 
recruits public safety support agencies and has some limited involvement with the Cleveland Mayor’s office.  
A technical communications study was conducted in 2002, but the result is not clearly defined as the UA’s 
formal strategic plan nor is it known whether it includes the necessary components to create a strategic plan.  
The current funding for interoperable communications is mainly through federal grants with no long-term 
funding plan to apply regional resources to communications interoperability needs.  Coordination and 
cooperation among individual jurisdictions is not well established and agencies have their own agenda with 
regard to communications interoperability.  Although the first responder community is dedicated to 
advancing interoperable communications capabilities, there does not appear to be a direct line of 
communications among regional and state leaders.   
Recommendations:  
• 
Establish a regular meeting schedule and membership, include all agencies, and define roles and 
responsibilities 
• 
Develop and document the necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) that include local, 
state, and federal agencies to support partnerships on regional communications interoperability 
• 
Develop a strategic plan beyond the technical study and operational focus of the TICP with participant 
approval, adoption, and acceptance; align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional 
interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) communications interoperability planning 
and sustainable funding 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official with political and fiscal authority to specifically 
advocate for and focus on communications interoperability 
• 
Consider establishing a direct line of communication among the local and state level organizations to 
advocate the importance of interoperable communications

not yet been finalized and formally accepted, which represents a significant set back in advancing 
communications interoperability across the area.  In regards to command and control procedures, the 
Cleveland UA is in the process of implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident 
Command System (ICS), and has begun training for fire, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and 
public support disciplines (e.g., hospitals).  However, the UA demonstrated deficiencies during the TICP 
validation exercise, such as the Communications Unit Leaders experienced problems identifying themselves 
during emergency response, there were not enough COMLs at the incident, and there was a delay of 45 
minutes in establishing a command post.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Adopt the TICP as the regional communications plan 
• 
Once adopted, disseminate and train personnel on regional SOPs, and ensure consistency with regional 
and statewide communications interoperability planning efforts 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

The Cleveland UA demonstrated familiarity and successful use of the interoperable communications 
equipment during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., shared channels and shared systems).  However, the UA 
also experienced several deficiencies with radio caches or gateways that illustrate the need for continued 
testing and exercising of interoperable communications equipment (e.g., improvements needed in setup and 
use of gateways for command and control purposes).  For example, the talk groups established on the shared 
system were not appropriately set up to handle traffic, and gateways at a site experienced technical problems.  
Additionally, in a recent real-world event (blackout in 2003), Cleveland officials indicated that it had 
difficulty in establishing interoperable communications across agencies and jurisdictions.  For example, 
federal agencies had problems in the TICP validation exercise (e.g., U.S. Coast Guard did not have a direct 
line of communication with the Cleveland UA emergency response units). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperable communications resources to improve 
proficiency (e.g., radio cache and gateways) 
• 
Involve additional local, state, and federal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

In the UA, the City of Cleveland and remaining agencies in Cuyahoga County operate 20 very high frequency, 20 ultra 
high frequency, and seven 800 megahertz (MHz) radio systems.  Interoperability is achieved by sharing radios, 
gateways, and channels (National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee and Multi-Agency Radio 
Communications System [MARCS]).  Various agencies have access to the State of Ohio MARCS 800 MHz digital 
trunked system’s radios for command and control during multi-agency incidents.  The City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga 
County are in the process of developing the Cuyahoga Area-wide Radio System (CARS).  CARS is a countywide 
Project 25-compliant 800 MHz digital trunked system that will be used by all agencies in the jurisdiction.

The Columbus Urban Area (UA) includes the City of Columbus and Franklin County, inclusive of all 
jurisdictions within that county. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
The Franklin County Board of Commissioners and the Mayor of the City of Columbus have made public 
safety communications a priority for the UA and have developed a governance structure that demonstrates 
their focus on tactical communications interoperability.  The Homeland Security Advisory Committee, which 
they established, created a subcommittee for interoperable communications technical issues and additional 
subcommittees to address other topics, including operational and training issues.  The governance structure 
has been in place for interoperable communications since the establishment of the 800 megahertz (MHz) 
Advisory Committee in 1995, has been refined through work with COPS in 2003, and more recently through 
the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) process.  Additionally, the Columbus UA has an 
interoperability strategic plan in place and is accepted by all participating agencies within the UA prior to the 
development of the TICP.  Franklin County officials indicated that they were preparing to begin strategic 
planning efforts beyond the UA, including all of the 14 counties in the Ohio Homeland Security Region 4.  
Political leaders (e.g., the Franklin County Board of Commissioners and the Mayor of the City of Columbus) 
have provided policy and fiscal support for interoperable communications issues, and budgeting is developed 
based on regional (rather than agency-specific) needs.  Agencies have individually agreed in writing to 
support their own required operational and maintenance costs following the expiration of equipment 
warranty periods across the shared system.  The area is encouraged to consider whether their current 
approach to prioritizing and sustaining funding is sufficient to support its long-term interoperability goals of 
including additional agencies as part of the 800 MHz shared system.  The Columbus UA has an ongoing 
maintenance and upgrade plan that is supported by user fees.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to recruit and involve organizations, even if they are not specifically involved in the decision-
making group 
• 
Implement the review and revision of strategic plans (beyond 1 year) according to the needs of the UA 
• 
Encourage a regional interoperability funding strategy, including funding sources that will be needed to 
address long-term goals (i.e., new investments, extending the existing shared system) 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The Columbus UA has had communications interoperability SOPs in place for more than a decade, and all 
existing SOPs were incorporated into the TICP.  As with a previous United States Department of Justice 
Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant, the UA used the TICP development process 
as an opportunity to update and enhance its policies.  The UA is commended for taking aggressive steps in 
disseminating these policies through bi-monthly training sessions for member agencies based on the TICP 
Implementation Workshop.  The National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Management
