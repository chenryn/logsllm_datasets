User: This has been driving me crazy for the past 2 days.
I installed virtualenv on my Macbook using pip install virtualenv.
But when I try to create a new virtualenv using virtualenv venv, I get the error saying "virtualenv : command not found".
I used pip show virtualenv and the location of the installation is "Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages" but I can't figure out where the executable is. I tried dozens other similar looking posts but those solutions do not work for me.
Any ideas what might be going wrong here?
Assistant: As mentioned in the comments, you've got the virtualenv module installed properly in the expected environment since python -m venv allows you to create virtualenv's. 
The fact that virtualenv is not a recognized command is a result of the virtualenv.py not being in your system PATH and/or not being executable. The root cause could be outdated distutils or setuptools.
You should attempt to locate the virtualenv.py file, ensure it is executable (chmod +x) and that its location is in your system PATH. On my system, virtualenv.py is in the ../Pythonx.x/Scripts folder, but this may be different for you.
