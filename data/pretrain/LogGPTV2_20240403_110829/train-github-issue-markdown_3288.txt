# Command Queue language or simple Commands Queue
To be able to in a single command time queue up multiple commands that can
either run sequentially or based on conditions(especially if integrated well).
for example, in my program, I use Mercurial, with Perl for build environment
and python to run tests. Sometimes I want to locally run it like
    → C:\Users\project› q-commands (perl build.pl workspace --androidSupport=true >
                                     if("build sucessful"),
                                     [py tests.py --test-project=Android --test-filter=GradelTests]
                                     | hg up -r fixedBranch)
# Proposed technical implementation details
personally not sure how can we implement it but this seems super useful and
new build dev friendly and overall expandable over time.  
Allowing python or other languages that we can build pipelines in to have the
ability to provide `explicit.terminal.outs`  
where you can basically have on a function in python that simple returns
       def isBuildSucessful(): 
             wte.explicitoutbool("isBuildSucessful",True)
and in the terminal we can have
    → C:\Users\project›py main.py .explicit-return("isBuildSuccessful")
    → C:\Users\project› True
