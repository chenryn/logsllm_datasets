In WebVR one could simply use `camera.getWorldDirection()` to find the
direction in which the camera is pointed in VR. As of r113, in WebXR this same
call returns information about the parent rig of the camera, rather than the
camera, at least in Oculus browser on both Quest and Go.
The culprit is the line `this.updateMatrixWorld( true )` in the function,
because without it the correct camera information is returned. I can't see any
recent changes in `camera.updateMatrixWorld` that would cause the change. Is
this just expected behavior in WebXR vs WebVR? If so then
`camera.getWorldDirection` is not useful in this context.
