Hi there!
I am using an anaconda 4.3.18 64 bits installation on windows 7. the version
of python is 3.6.1 and numpy version is 1.12.1
I imported an ascii file, and ran these commands:  
import numpy as np
# read the ascii file into attribute variable
sorted_items= np.sort(attribute, axis=0)  
sorted_ids= np.argsort(attribute,axis=0)
Then, I exported sorted_items and sorted_ids to an ASCII file.
Thereafter, I imported the same file in Octave version 4.2.0 64 bits and ran
this command:  
[sorted_items,sorted_ids]= sort(attribute)
Also, I exported the outputs to an ASCII file.
When I compared these outputs, I noticed the following:
  * The sorted values in Python match those in Octave
  * The sorted index show issues. The index reported by numpy are different to those reported by Octave in many places (see the excell spreadsheet, rows with blue background)
  * The sorted index show some good matches. A good index match is when the Octave index is one value higher than the one for Python (because Octave starts counting from 1, instead of 0 for Python)
I attached to this issue two files: the excell spreadsheet, and the text file
containing the data used to report this issue.
Many thanks,  
Ivan
