# Query Exported Data from Azure Monitor in Azure Data Explorer

Exporting data from Azure Monitor to an Azure Storage account allows for low-cost retention and the ability to reallocate logs to different regions. You can use Azure Data Explorer to query this exported data. After configuration, supported tables that are sent from your Log Analytics workspaces to a storage account will be available as a data source in Azure Data Explorer.

The process involves the following steps:
1. Export data from the Log Analytics workspace to the storage account.
2. Create an external table in your Azure Data Explorer cluster and define the data type mappings.
3. Query the data from Azure Data Explorer.

## Send Data to Azure Storage

Azure Monitor logs can be exported to a storage account using any of the following methods:
- **Log Analytics Workspace Data Export**: Export all data from your Log Analytics workspace to a storage account or event hub. For more information, see [Log Analytics Workspace Data Export in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export).
- **Scheduled Export via Logic App**: Use a logic app workflow to schedule the export of filtered or aggregated data. This method is subject to [log query limits](/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#log-analytics-workspaces). For more details, see [Archive Data from a Log Analytics Workspace to Azure Storage Using Azure Logic Apps](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-export-logic-app).
- **One-Time Export via Logic App**: Perform a one-time export using a logic app workflow. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Logs Connector for Azure Logic Apps](/azure/connectors/connectors-azure-monitor-logs).
- **One-Time Export to Local Machine**: Use a PowerShell script to export data to a local machine. For more information, see [Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQueryExport](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQueryExport).

> [!TIP]
> You can use an existing Azure Data Explorer cluster or create a new dedicated cluster with the necessary configurations.

## Create an External Table in Azure Data Explorer

An [external table](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/schema-entities/externaltables) in Azure Data Explorer is a schema entity that references data stored outside your cluster, such as in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Store Gen2. Similar to regular tables, an external table has a defined schema, but the data is managed externally.

To access your exported Azure Monitor data, follow these steps to create an external table:
1. Use the [getschema](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/getschemaoperator) operator in Log Analytics to retrieve the schema of the exported table. This includes the columns and their data types.

1. [Create an external table using the Azure Data Explorer web UI wizard](external-table.md). In the [schema tab](external-table.md#schema-tab), the tool attempts to automatically detect the schema. Ensure that the detected schema matches the schema from the previous step. If there are discrepancies, adjust the schema by selecting the arrow on a column and accessing the menu.

## Query the Exported Data from Azure Data Explorer

Use the [external_table](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/externaltablefunction) function to query the exported data from Azure Data Explorer. Here is an example query:

```kusto
external_table("HBTest", "map") | take 10000
```
