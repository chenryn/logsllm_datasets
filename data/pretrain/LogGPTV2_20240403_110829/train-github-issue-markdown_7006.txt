### Describe the workflow you want to enable
I want to be able to run Forward Sequential Feature Selector and know the
order which it picked the features.  
Right now you can only get the indices or a boolean mask of all the features
you've selected. Of course, you can run it once and select 1 feature, then run
it again and select 2 features, and continue this to pull out the order that
features were selected. However, this would be unnecessarily computationally
costly.
### Describe your proposed solution
Add an attribute `feature_order`. I should be able to do
`SequentialFeatureSelector.feature_order` and get an array of the indices of
the features as they are selected.  
I edited the source code (sklearn/feature_selection/_sequential.py) on my
laptop with just 3 lines of code and it works.  
Under the function `def fit(...)` I added:
> feature_order = [] # before the for loop  
>  feature_order.append(new_feature_idx) # this is at the end of the for loop  
>  self.feature_order = feature_order # at the end of the function
