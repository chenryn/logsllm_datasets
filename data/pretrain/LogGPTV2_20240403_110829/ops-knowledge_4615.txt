Assistant: To achieve intranet penetration within the company while ensuring network security, VPN (Virtual Private Network, virtual private network) technology can be used. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1. Build a VPN server. You can choose to use public cloud or private cloud to build a VPN server, such as AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, etc. 2. Set the IP address and port of the VPN server, and set the encryption method and identity authentication method to ensure the security of the VPN connection. 3. Install the VPN client. On the device using VPN connection, install the corresponding VPN client software, and enter the IP address and port of the VPN server, as well as the encryption method and identity authentication method used. 4. Configure the VPN client. Set the local network IP segment, DNS resolution and other options in the client to ensure the stability of the communication between the client and the server. In this way, it is possible to achieve intranet penetration, ensure the security of data transmission, prevent external malicious attacks or steal confidential information, and at the same time, it is convenient to access internal resources of the enterprise on the external network. Special attention should be paid to the fact that in the process of implementing VPN technology, relevant security regulations and information security standards must be strictly followed to ensure data security.
