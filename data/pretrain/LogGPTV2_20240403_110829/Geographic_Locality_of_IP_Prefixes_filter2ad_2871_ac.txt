Table 4: Contribution of the various registries (Breadth dataset).
Using such allocation records, we investigated how of-
ten fragmented allocation was the cause for ASes an-
nouncing discontiguous preﬁxes. If a pair of discontigu-
ous preﬁxes are from discontiguous allocations, then we
conclude that an fragmented allocation has occurred.
Table 4 gives a registry-wise breakdown of the preﬁxes
from fragmented allocations, discontiguous preﬁxes and
the total number of preﬁxes observed. We have also tab-
ulated the total fraction of the address space allocated at
these registries. The table shows that LACNIC experi-
ences less allocation pressure and similarly causes fewer
fragmented allocations.
To further understand the reasons behind discontiguous
allocations, we examined the allocation patterns of the
20 hAS,locationi pairs in Breadth from which the largest
number of discontiguous preﬁxes originated. We observed
that 23% of the discontiguous allocations in these 20
hAS,locationi pairs were made from discontiguous spaces
on the same day, indicating that the registries were forced
to make such assignments due to the paucity of IPv4 ad-
dresses. The remaining 77% of the allocations were made
during different periods of time. Possible explanations for
discontiguous address space allocations to an AS at differ-
ent points of time are: (1) scarce IPv4 addresses are allo-
cated conservatively to organizations, resulting in a frag-
mented set of addresses for each organization; and (2) two
or more organizations with discontiguous addresses have
one AS number due to a merger or acquisition.
4.2.2 Load balance
and L2
and the remaining trafﬁc through link L2
An AS might announce a speciﬁc subnet of a bigger pre-
ﬁx in order to balance load over its two incoming links.
For example, consider an AS with preﬁx pi and two in-
, which desires that the trafﬁc to a
coming links L1
more speciﬁc (i.e., “longer”) preﬁx pj arrive through link
. To achieve
L1
this goal, it announces the “longer” preﬁx pj over link L1
and pi over L2
. This practice is commonly referred to
as “BGP hole punching”. Let Ddiscontig denote the set
of all discontiguous preﬁxes in a dataset. To determine
whether a pair of preﬁxes {pi, pj} appears in Ddiscontig
due to hole punching, we check if their AS announces a
supernet ps that contains both pi and pj from the same lo-
cation, thus producing a discontiguous pair of preﬁxes. We
can observe from Table 3 that the number of discontiguous
preﬁxes that appear due to load balancing is negligible—

between 1.5% and 3.9% of the total number of discontigu-
ous preﬁxes.
4.2.3 Misclassiﬁcation
As our location mapping data is incomplete, we could
have misclassiﬁed a set of contiguous preﬁxes as discon-
tiguous due to the absence of traceroutes to some preﬁxes.
Consider a set of contiguous preﬁxes {pi, pj , pk}. Assume
that we have mapped pi and pk to a location L, but we
do not have any location for preﬁx pj. Then, by observ-
ing only preﬁxes pi and pk, we might mistakenly assume
that the AS is announcing discontiguous preﬁxes from the
same location. Hence, for every pair of discontiguous pre-
ﬁxes {pi, pk} ∈ Ddiscontig, we check if the “missing” in-
termediate preﬁxes are in fact announced by the AS in the
RouteViews table. If so, we count this as an instance of
misclassifying the pair {pi, pk} as discontiguous.
In Table 3, we observe that the Breadth dataset has more
misclassiﬁcations than the other two. This result can be
explained by the fact that, despite tracerouting to all adver-
tised preﬁxes, we could not map all preﬁxes’ locations due
to the limitations of undns. This limitation has a stronger
inﬂuence on Breadth (which reached 161,974 preﬁxes)
than on Clients (which reached 45,573).
4.3 Contiguous preﬁxes with multiple locations
In this section, we study the extent to which ASes adver-
tise contiguous IP preﬁxes that refer to networks in diverse
geographic locations. We found 2,281 pairs of contiguous
preﬁxes advertised by 384 different ASes. Of these pairs
of preﬁxes, about one-fourth (607) of the pairs contained
hosts in distinct geographic locations.3 This ﬁnding sug-
gests that the opportunities for aggregation may be less
than that implied by the CIDR Report.
Figure 2(a) shows a CDF of the maximum distance
spanned by hosts contained within a set of contiguous pre-
3Note that this measure is also a lower bound, as certain IP preﬁxes that
we attributed to the same location might actually contain hosts in a dif-
ferent location that we did not probe.

ﬁxes advertised by the same AS.4 About 10% of all sets
of contiguous preﬁxes were advertised from a single geo-
graphic location.
To better understand whether or not it makes sense to
aggregate two contiguous preﬁxes, we deﬁned a metric
called the diameter ratio that highlights cases where a
pair of contiguous preﬁxes represent two well-deﬁned ge-
ographic clusters that are signiﬁcantly far apart from each
other. The diameter ratio is deﬁned formally as follows:
diameter ratio =
maxdist(L1 ∪ L2)
min(maxdist(L1), maxdist(L2))
or L2
where Li is the set of locations contained in preﬁx pi and
maxdist is the maximum geographic distance between
any pair of IP addresses in a set of IP addresses (i.e., the
contains
“diameter” of the preﬁx). When either L1
only a single location, we set the denominator to 1. Intu-
itively, the diameter ratio is large when the locations within
each of one or both of two preﬁxes are close together, but
the aggregate set of locations are far apart from each other.
A large diameter ratio may also reﬂect the case where the
locations in one preﬁx are tightly clustered but the loca-
tions in the second are not. A large diameter ratio implies
that aggregating the contiguous preﬁxes would remove the
ability to express geographic routing policies.
Figure 2(b) shows the diameter ratio for each pair of
contiguous preﬁxes in the routing table. We were surprised
to see that smaller contiguous preﬁxes (i.e., those in the
/24-/31 range) spanned a greater geographic distance than
larger contiguous preﬁxes (this phenomenon is shown in
both Figure 2(a) and 2(b)). This geographic diversity is
reﬂected along all three metrics (i.e., number of distinct
locations, maximum distance between IP addresses, and
diameter ratio). Upon further examination, we found that
this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that many
ISPs based in the United States receive large preﬁx allo-
cations and divide the allocation along /24 boundaries, ad-
vertising different /24s from different cities. On the other
hand, we observe that ISPs in Europe and Asia typically
advertise preﬁxes that correspond more closely with their
actual allocations, which are usually considerably larger
than /24. For example, in Europe, AS 5089 (NTL Group
Limited, UK) advertises two separate contiguous /15s—
80.2.0.0/15 and 80.4.0.0/15—for hosts in Cambridge and
Luton, which are only about 75 miles apart.
To understand the extent to which the CIDR Report
could be overestimating the opportunities for aggregation,
we performed a CIDR Report style calculation on our
dataset too. The CIDR Report computes the reduction in
the number of contiguous preﬁxes when contiguous pre-
ﬁxes with same origin AS and AS path are aggregated.
A similar calculation on our Breadth dataset showed that
the number of preﬁxes advertised can be reduced by 64%
if we aggregate. However, aggregating geographically di-
verse preﬁxes could conﬂict with the trafﬁc engineering
goals of an AS. Hence, if we aggregate only the preﬁxes
that in addition to having similar AS paths, are geographi-
cally “close” (we used diameter ratio ≤ 500 as a deﬁnition
for “close”), then the number of announced preﬁxes could
be reduced by only 20%. Thus, the CIDR Report could
be overestimating the opportunities for aggregation by a
factor of 3.
5. Conclusion
This paper studied the geographic properties of IP pre-
Our
ﬁxes and their implications on Internet routing.
ﬁndings have important implications not only for net-
work applications that use IP preﬁxes to cluster end hosts,
but also for Internet addressing. Advertising routes on a
granularity that more closely reﬂects geographic locations
(whether by renumbering, or by changing the addressing
scheme entirely) could reduce routing table size by creat-
ing opportunities for aggregation.
