## Abstract

The Mirai botnet, primarily composed of embedded and IoT devices, gained notoriety in late 2016 with a series of massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on high-profile targets. This paper provides a seven-month retrospective analysis of Mirai's growth to a peak of 600,000 infections and its DDoS activities. By integrating multiple measurement perspectives, we analyze the botnet's emergence, the affected device classes, and the evolution and competition among Mirai variants. Our findings highlight the fragility of the IoT ecosystem. We argue that Mirai represents a significant shift in botnet development, demonstrating that simple malicious techniques can compromise enough low-end devices to threaten even well-defended targets. To mitigate this risk, we recommend both technical and non-technical interventions and propose future research directions.

## 1. Introduction

In September 2016, a series of large-scale DDoS attacks temporarily disabled Krebs on Security [46], OVH [43], and Dyn [36]. The attack on Krebs exceeded 600 Gbps, one of the largest on record. Notably, the overwhelming traffic originated from hundreds of thousands of low-powered IoT devices controlled by the Mirai botnet.

While other IoT botnets like BASHLITE [86] and Carna [38] predated Mirai, Mirai was the first to become a high-profile DDoS threat. Several factors contributed to its rapid rise and scale: efficient spreading through Internet-wide scanning, widespread use of insecure default passwords in IoT products, and the simplicity of its infection strategy. Mirai has since spawned numerous variants, leading to speculation that "IoT botnets are the new normal of DDoS attacks" [64].

This paper investigates the rapid rise of Mirai and the vulnerable IoT ecosystem it exploited. We present longitudinal measurements of the botnet's growth, composition, evolution, and DDoS activities from August 1, 2016, to February 28, 2017. Our data sources include network telescope probes, Internet-wide banner scans, IoT honeypots, C2 milkers, DNS traces, and logs from attack victims. These datasets enable a comprehensive analysis of Mirai and suggest both technical and non-technical defenses against future attacks.

We track the initial outbreak of Mirai, which infected nearly 65,000 IoT devices in its first 20 hours, reaching a steady state of 200,000 to 300,000 infections. The infected devices were concentrated in specific geographic regions and autonomous systems, with Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam accounting for 41.5% of infections. We confirm that Mirai targeted a variety of IoT and embedded devices, including DVRs, IP cameras, routers, and printers, but the final device composition was influenced by the market shares and design decisions of a few consumer electronics manufacturers.

By analyzing over 1,000 malware samples, we document the evolution of Mirai into dozens of variants propagated by competing botnet operators. These variants improved detection avoidance, added new device targets, and enhanced DNS resilience. Mirai launched over 15,000 attacks, targeting not only high-profile sites but also game servers, telecoms, and anti-DDoS providers. While DDoS was Mirai's primary attack vector, future IoT malware could leverage compromised devices for ad fraud, extortion, or cryptocurrency mining. Mirai's global reach and the lack of infrastructure for security patches made defending against it challenging.

Finally, we explore the broader security landscape of IoT devices. The absence of established security best practices, developed in response to desktop worms and malware, has created an environment ripe for exploitation. However, unique challenges in automatic updates, end-of-life management, and consumer notifications must be addressed. Without improved defenses, IoT-based attacks will likely remain a potent threat as botnet variants continue to evolve. Mirai, meaning "the future" in Japanese, seems aptly named.

## 2. The Mirai Botnet

Mirai is a worm-like family of malware that infects IoT devices and uses them to launch DDoS attacks. We provide a timeline of Mirai's emergence and discuss its structure and propagation.

### Timeline of Events

Reports of Mirai surfaced as early as August 31, 2016 [89], but it gained attention in mid-September 2016 with massive DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security [46] and OVH [74] (Figure 1). Additional high-profile attacks targeted DNS provider Dyn [36] and Lonestar Cell, a Liberian telecom [45]. In early 2017, the Mirai author was identified [49]. We corroborate our findings with these media reports and expand on the public information about Mirai.

A significant event was the public release of Mirai's source code on hackforums.net [4]. This code informed our measurement methodology (Section 3). The release led to the proliferation of Mirai variants with competing operators. One variant added support for a router exploit through the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP), leading to an outage at Deutsche Telekom in late November 2016 [47], with the suspected attacker arrested in February 2017 [13].

### Botnet Structure and Propagation

Figure 2 summarizes Mirai's operation, based on the released source code. Mirai spreads by entering a rapid scanning phase where it asynchronously sends TCP SYN probes to pseudorandom IPv4 addresses, excluding those in a hard-coded blacklist, on Telnet ports 23 and 2323. If a potential victim is identified, Mirai attempts a brute-force login using 10 username and password pairs from a pre-configured list. Upon successful login, Mirai sends the victim's IP and credentials to a report server.

A separate loader program then infects the device by logging in, determining the system environment, and downloading and executing architecture-specific malware. After infection, Mirai conceals itself by deleting the binary and obfuscating its process name. It also kills other processes bound to specific ports and those associated with competing infections, including other Mirai variants, .anime [25], and Qbot [72].

## 3. Measurement Methodology

### 3.1 Network Telescope

Mirai's indiscriminate scanning strategy makes it possible to track its propagation. We monitored all network requests to a network telescope [9] consisting of 4.7 million IP addresses operated by Merit Network from July 18, 2016, to February 28, 2017. On average, the telescope received 1.1 million packets from 269,000 IP addresses per minute. To distinguish Mirai traffic, we used a unique fingerprint: every probe had a TCP sequence number equal to the destination IP address, a pattern with a 1/2^32 likelihood. We observed 116.2 billion Mirai probes from 55.4 million IP addresses, compared to only three IPs with this fingerprint before Mirai's emergence.

To account for DHCP churn, we tracked the botnet size by considering the number of hosts actively scanning at the start of every hour. We grouped packets from a single IP address into logical scans, identifying those targeting the IPv4 space at a rate of at least five packets per second, expiring inactive scans after 20 minutes. We geolocated IPs using Maxmind [61].

### 3.2 Active Scanning

While Mirai is known as an IoT botnet, there has been little comprehensive analysis of infected devices over its lifetime. We used Censys [22] to scan the IPv4 space and aggregate application layer data about hosts, focusing on HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet, and CWMP scans from July 19, 2016, to February 28, 2017.

Accurate device labeling is challenging due to several factors. First, Mirai disables common services immediately upon infection, making it difficult to gather detailed information. Despite these challenges, our analysis provides insights into the types of devices infected and the overall composition of the botnet.
