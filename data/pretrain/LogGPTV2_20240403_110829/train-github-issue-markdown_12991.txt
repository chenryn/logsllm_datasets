**Compilation Error with OpenCV**

I am encountering an issue while trying to compile OpenCV. Below are the relevant log details:

```

```

The compilation process fails due to a missing `stdlib.h` file. Can someone help me resolve this issue? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance!
