User: Introduce the commonly used types of virtualization technologies, including full virtualization and paravirtualization, and explain their differences.
Assistant: Common types of virtualization technologies include full virtualization and paravirtualization. Full virtualization refers to treating a virtual machine as a complete computer. For the operating system and applications in the virtual machine, they run a relatively independent virtualization environment without considering the physical environment in which they actually run. The underlying hardware devices of the virtual machine are simulated by virtualization software, and the operating system and applications in the virtual machine can run as if they were running on a real physical machine. Paravirtualization means that some specific modifications have been made inside the virtual machine in order to better interact with the virtualization software. Paravirtualization means that the virtual machine is no longer completely virtualized, but has undergone some other modifications in a virtual environment. In a paravirtualized environment, a virtual machine needs to know its physical environment and make some changes to its own operation. Main differences: 1. Full virtualization requires virtualization software to simulate the underlying hardware device of the virtual machine, while paravirtualization does not need to do so. 2. In a fully virtualized environment, the operating system and applications in the virtual machine can run as if they were running on a real physical machine, while in a paravirtualized environment, some specific modifications are required. 3. Full virtualization is generally less efficient, while paravirtualization is more efficient.
