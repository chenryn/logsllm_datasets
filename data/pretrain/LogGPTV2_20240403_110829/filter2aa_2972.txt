In fact, almost every security technology 
depends on vulnerabilities…
Discovering and managing vulnerabilities
Vulnerability Mgmt
Fixing vulnerabilities
Patch/Systems Mgmt
Hackers viewing vulnerable, cleartext files
Encryption
Hackers taking advantage of vulnerable passwords, few controls
Authentication/Authorization
Vulnerability inherent in online identities.
Identity Mgmt
Vulnerabilities in software, end-user usage.
Anti-virus
Ensuring compliance to prevent attacks on vulnerabilities
Policy Management
Detecting hackers exploiting vulnerabilities
NIDS/HIDS
Addressing the data overflow issue caused by vulnerabilities
Event Correlation
Detecting and preventing hackers exploiting vulnerabilities
NIPS/HIPS
Blocking attackers taking advantage of vulnerabilities
Firewalls/VPN
