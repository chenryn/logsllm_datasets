User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL Server 'Real Time' Mirroring Possible? We have a SQL Server that has important databases for our clients, if the server goes down we want another server to be ready to be switched over (we would just change the IP). The question is, how can we automatically sync the primary SQL Server to the secondary one periodically through out the day? Or even in real time?

Thanks!

Assistant: You want to do database mirroring/log shipping : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187016.aspx.  Here's an article by Paul Randal you might want to look at as well : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee523927.aspx.  That guy knows his stuff.
