**Subject: SQL Server 'Real-Time' Mirroring Feasibility**

We have a SQL Server that hosts critical databases for our clients. In the event of a server failure, we need to be able to switch to a secondary server (by changing the IP address) with minimal downtime.

**Question:**
How can we automatically synchronize the primary SQL Server with the secondary one throughout the day? Is real-time synchronization possible?

**Possible Solutions:**
To achieve this, you may want to consider implementing **Database Mirroring** or **Log Shipping**. These are common methods for maintaining a synchronized copy of your primary database on a secondary server.

- **Database Mirroring:** This feature allows for near-real-time data replication between the primary and secondary servers. It provides high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- **Log Shipping:** This involves periodically copying transaction log backups from the primary server to the secondary server and restoring them. While not as instantaneous as mirroring, it is a reliable method for maintaining a synchronized copy.

For more detailed information, I recommend the following resources:
- [Microsoft Documentation on Database Mirroring](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187016.aspx)
- [Article by Paul Randal on Log Shipping](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee523927.aspx)

Paul Randal is a well-respected expert in the field, and his insights should be very helpful.

Thank you!
