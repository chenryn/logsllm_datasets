Using Elasticsearch 1.4.1 and running on Ubuntu Trusty with Java 1.7.0_72, the
following call in the start method of a river plugin never returns:
    client.admin().indices().prepareExists("common").execute().actionGet();
It works using Elasticsearch 1.3.6.
It also works without using `admin()`:
    client.prepareExists("common").execute().actionGet();
It also works on MacOS.
Maybe this is related to https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-
couchdb/issues/78 ?
