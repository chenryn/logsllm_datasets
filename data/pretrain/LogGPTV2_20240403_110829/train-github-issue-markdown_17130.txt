Object Spread Initializers is a proposed feature for ES2016 that is particularly useful when writing Redux reducers. This syntax is supported by Babel, but Visual Studio Code currently marks the spread operator as a syntax error.

For more information on this feature, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/blob/master/Spread.md).

It would be greatly appreciated if Visual Studio Code could stop marking the use of this feature as an error, indicated by the red squiggly line. The current behavior in Visual Studio Code is further detailed in [Issue #1640](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1640).
