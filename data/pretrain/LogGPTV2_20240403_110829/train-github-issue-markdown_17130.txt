Object Spread Initializers is a proposed feature of ES2016 and is very useful
when writing Redux reducers. The syntax is supported in babel, but when using
the feature in Visual Studio Code it will mark the spread operator as a syntax
error.
See: https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-
spread/blob/master/Spread.md  
for more information of the feature.
It would be very nice if Visual Studio Code did not mark the use of this
feature as an error with a red squiggly.
The current behavior in Visual Studio Code is also described in Issue #1640
