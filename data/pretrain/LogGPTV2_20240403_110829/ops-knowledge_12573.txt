User: I'm trying to work out to integrate Python3 into Vim, I know I need to do it when compiling vim but I cant seem to get it right. I'm using homebrew to install with the following script: 
brew install vim --override-system-vim --with-python3
It installs vim however when i check the version, python3 is still not supported.
Assistant: I thought I had the same issue but realised I needed to re-start the shell.
If the problem still persists, it may be that you have older versions that homebrew is still trying to install. brew cleanup would remove older bottles and perhaps allow you to install the latest. 
If this is still giving you trouble, I found removing vim with brew uninstall --force vim and then reinstalling with brew install vim --override-system-vim --with-python3 worked for me.
EDIT 2018-08-22
Python 3 is now default when compiling vim. Therefore the command below should integrate vim with Python 3 automatically.
brew install vim --override-system-vim
