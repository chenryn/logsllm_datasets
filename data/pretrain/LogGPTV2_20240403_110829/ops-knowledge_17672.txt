User:  How to use Nginx as a front-end reverse proxy on Linux?
Assistant: Here are the steps to use Nginx as a front-end reverse proxy on Linux: 1. Install Nginx Install Nginx on Linux using a package manager such as apt: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx ``` 2. Configure Nginx Add the following content in the default Nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/nginx.conf) to forward the request to the backend server: ``` server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_server; } } ``` In this example, Nginx will receive HTTP requests from the domain name example.com and forward them to the server named backend_server. If your backend server is on the same machine, you can use localhost or 127.0.0.1 instead of backend_server. 3. Reload the Nginx configuration After changing the Nginx configuration file, use the following command to reload the configuration: ``` sudo service nginx reload ``` 4. Test the reverse proxy Use curl or a browser to test whether the front-end reverse proxy is working properly: ``` curl http://example.com ``` If everything worked, you should be able to see the response coming back from the backend server. Note: In order for Nginx to work, you need to ensure that the firewall port is open and forward traffic to that port. For example, if you're running Nginx on an AWS EC2 instance, you'll need to update your security group to allow traffic through that port.
