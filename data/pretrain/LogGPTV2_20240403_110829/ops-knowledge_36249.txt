I recently started setting up a CentOS server and noticed that the default version of Python is 2.6.6. I would like to use Python 2.7 instead. After some research, I found that Python 2.6.6 is used by system tools such as YUM, so it's not advisable to modify or remove it.

Additionally, I checked my local Mac and found that I have multiple versions of Python installed: 2.6.8, 2.7.5, and 3.3.3.

To avoid accidentally installing Python 2.7 twice on my CentOS server, I want to know how to list all the versions of Python that are currently installed. 

**How can I check for all installed versions of Python on CentOS?**

**Answer:**
You can use the `whereis` command to locate all installed versions of Python, both for the current user and the root user. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
whereis python
```

This will show you the paths where Python is installed, allowing you to verify which versions are present on your system.
