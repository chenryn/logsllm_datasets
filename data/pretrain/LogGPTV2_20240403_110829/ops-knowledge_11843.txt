Question: "A developer believes that using short circuit evaluation in conditional statements enhances performance without any negative impact on the logic of a program. Which argument counters this belief effectively, explaining the potential risks of short circuit evaluation?"
 "A": "Short circuit evaluation can cause some expressions not to be evaluated, which might skip necessary side effects and introduce logic errors."
 "B": "Short circuit evaluation significantly reduces the readability of the code, making it difficult to maintain."
 "C": "Short circuit evaluation is not well-defined in programming standards, leading to unpredictable behavior across different compilers."
 "D": "Short circuit evaluation can only be used with numerical data types, limiting its applicability in string and object manipulation."
Answer: A
