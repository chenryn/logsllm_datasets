I recently started setting up a CentOS server and noticed that the default version of Python is 2.6.6. I would prefer to use Python 2.7 instead. After some research, I found that Python 2.6.6 is used by system tools such as YUM, so it's not advisable to modify or remove it.

Additionally, I checked my Mac and found that I have multiple versions of Python installed: 2.6.8, 2.7.5, and 3.3.3.

To summarize, I want to know how to list all the versions of Python installed on my CentOS server to avoid accidentally installing the same version twice. 

**How can I check for all installed Python versions on CentOS?**

**Solution:**
To find all the Python packages installed on your CentOS system, you can use the following command:

```bash
yum list installed | grep python
```

This command will list all the Python-related packages and their versions, helping you to avoid duplicate installations.
