Hi,
I've noticed that numpy's testsuite hangs when numpy is built against MKL
2018.2 - but runs to completion when built against MKL 2017.1.
This is the case for numpy v1.14.2, 1.14.x HEAD and master branches.
I'm on CentOS 7.4 x86_64 on a Broadwell processor, python 2.7.5 (but also
affects other pythons), Cython 0.28.2, nose 1.3.7.
By executing this: python -c "import numpy; numpy.test(verbose=2)"
I can see that the hang occurs while running this test:
numpy.distutils.tests.test_exec_command.TestExecCommand.test_basic
At this point, the python interpreter is consuming an entire CPU core and, if
I strace it, I see a stream of identical lines, all showing:
sched_yield() = 0
Any ideas, please?
Thanks!
