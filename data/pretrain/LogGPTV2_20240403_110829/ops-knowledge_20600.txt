User: How to execute a command or script on multiple servers using Ansible?
Assistant: Using Ansible makes it easy to execute commands or scripts on multiple servers. Here are the steps: 1. Confirm that the SSH service on all servers is started and can be connected via public key. 2. Create an Ansible Inventory file that contains the servers that need to execute commands or scripts. 3. Create an Ansible Playbook file that contains commands or scripts to be executed on the server. When using commands, make sure to use the module shell or command, formatting the output as desired. 4. Run the Ansible Playbook command and specify the Inventory and Playbook files. This will execute the command or script on all servers. For example, here is a sample Ansible Playbook file (test.yml): ``` --- - name: Execute command on multiple servers hosts: servers gather_facts: no tasks: - name: Run command shell: ls ``` in In this example, we specify to execute the "ls" command on the host group named "servers". The Playbook file can then be run with the following command: ``` ansible-playbook -i inventory_file test.yml ``` where inventory_file is the path to Ansible's Inventory file. After running this command, Ansible will run the "ls" command on all specified servers.
