User: I made a shortcut of a python script on my desktop.
Now I want to open this with the command line and parameters.
If I open the properties of the shortcut, I can add the parameters, but I can't force to be opened with the command line.
The default program for these files is notepad++, but if I change it to "command line" and double click it, then just the command line opens with the respective path given in the shortcut, but not executing the file.
What do I need to do?
Assistant: Change the shortcut target to "cmd filename"  (i.e. add "cmd" before the target)
