Assistant: You can use the iptables tool or firewalld tool to set firewall rules in the Linux system. The following describes the operation steps and sample commands of the two methods respectively. 1. Use iptables to set firewall rules: Step 1: Install the iptables tool. The iptables tool is installed by default in most Linux distributions. If it is not installed, you can use the following command to install it: sudo apt-get install iptables # for Ubuntu/Debian sudo yum install iptables # for CentOS/Fedora Step 2: View the current firewall status Use the following command to view the current firewall status: sudo iptables -L â€“n Step 3: Set firewall rules Set firewall rules by defining rule chains, rule types, matching conditions and target conditions etc. to operate. Take prohibiting all inbound traffic as an example, you can set it by the following command: sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP If you need to allow the traffic of a certain port, you can set it by the following command: sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 - j ACCEPT means to allow the traffic of port 22 of the TCP protocol to pass. Step 4: Save the settings Use the following command to save the current iptables settings: sudo service iptables save 2. Use firewalld to set firewall rules: Step 1: Install the firewalld tool. The firewalld tool has been installed by default in most Linux distributions. If it is not installed, You can use the following command to install: sudo apt-get install firewalld # for Ubuntu/Debian sudo yum install firewalld # for CentOS/Fedora Step 2: Check the current firewall status Use the following command to check the current firewall status: sudo firewall-cmd -- state Step 3: Set firewall rules You can set firewall rules by defining rule types, services, ports, etc. Take the traffic allowed by the SSH service as an example, you can use the following command to set it: sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent means to allow traffic through the SSH service. If you need to allow the traffic of a certain port, you can set it through the following command: sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent means that the traffic of port 8080 of the TCP protocol is allowed to pass. Step 4: Reload and enable firewall settings Use the following commands to reload and enable the current firewalld settings: sudo firewall-cmd --reload sudo systemctl enable firewalld sudo systemctl start firewalld
