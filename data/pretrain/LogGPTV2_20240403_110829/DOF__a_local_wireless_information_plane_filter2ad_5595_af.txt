### Introduction

In this section, we will discuss the implementation and evaluation of DOF-SR (Direction of Arrival-based Frequency Sharing Radio) and its comparison with Jello, another smart radio design. The key focus is on how DOF-SR leverages the detection capabilities of Direction of Arrival (DoA) to optimize spectrum usage while minimizing interference with co-existing radios.

### System Overview

#### Spectrum Usage and Time-Sharing
- **DOF-SR Operation:**
  - **Frequency Bands:** DOF-SR operates in the 2.4 GHz and 2.5 GHz frequency bands.
  - **Time-Sharing Policy (P3):** DOF-SR shares the medium with WiFi by transmitting for 200 ms and then remaining idle for 200 ms. This period ensures that the WiFi radio has sufficient time to estimate the channel and achieve a stable throughput.
  - **Spatial Multiplexing:** During the active transmission period, DOF-SR uses spatial multiplexing across all four antennas.

#### Packet Transmission
- **Control Packet Synchronization:**
  - Before transmitting the encoded packet, DOF-SR sends a short control packet over a predefined narrowband control channel to the receiver. This packet includes information about the subcarriers to be used and the antenna weights.
  - The sender then transmits the data packet and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) before repeating the process.

### Implementation Details

#### Current Implementation
- **Objective:** The current implementation of DOF-SR aims to demonstrate the potential benefits of a smart physical layer (PHY) that leverages DoA detection.
- **Limitations:** It does not address MAC layer issues such as finding a usable control channel, rate adaptation, and contention among multiple DOF-SR nodes. These aspects are part of future work.

### Comparison with Jello

#### Jello Overview
- **Jello Design:**
  - Jello is a smart radio that estimates unused spectrum using edge detection and allocates it among multiple radios.
  - For a fair comparison, Jello is modified to use non-contiguous spectrum and spatial multiplexing with four MIMO antennas, similar to DOF-SR.
- **Key Differences:**
  - **Detection Method:** DOF-SR uses DoA detection, while Jello uses edge detection.
  - **Spectrum Utilization:** DOF-SR can appropriately use microwave oven and WiFi-occupied spectrum, whereas Jello cannot detect these specific types of occupancy.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Throughput and Interference:**
  - **Normalized Throughput:** The throughput achieved by DOF-SR and Jello is normalized by the throughput of an optimal offline scheme.
  - **Normalized Harmful Interference:** The performance drop of co-existing WiFi and Zigbee radios when DOF-SR or Jello are operating, normalized by their throughput without the smart radios.

### Experimental Setup

- **Testbed:**
  - A WiFi sender-receiver pair, a Zigbee sender-receiver pair, and a microwave oven are randomly placed in the testbed.
  - The WiFi and Zigbee radios operate on non-intersecting channels, and their bitrates depend on channel conditions.
- **Procedure:**
  - Raw 10-second dumps are taken using wideband radios at the sender and receiver.
  - DOF and Jello's edge detection algorithm process these dumps to determine spectral resources.
  - Each system transmits for 50 seconds, and the goodputs are computed.
  - The experiment is repeated 50 times, and the results are plotted.

### Results and Analysis

- **Policy P0:**
  - **DOF-SR:** Achieves an average normalized throughput of 0.93 and causes an average harmful interference of 0.1.
  - **Jello:** Achieves a normalized throughput of 0.82 and causes a harmful interference of 0.44.
  - **Conclusion:** DOF-SR provides a 15% gain in throughput and causes 35% less harm than Jello.

- **Policy P1:**
  - **DOF-SR:** Achieves an average normalized throughput of 0.93 and causes an average harmful interference of 0.1.
  - **Jello:** Achieves a normalized throughput of 0.61 and causes a harmful interference of 0.44.
  - **Conclusion:** With the ability to use microwave oven-occupied spectrum, DOF-SR provides a 50% increase in throughput over Jello, while still causing minimal harm.

- **Policy P2:**
  - **DOF-SR:** Achieves an average normalized throughput of 0.87 and causes an average harmful interference of 0.32.
  - **Jello:** Achieves a normalized throughput of 0.5 and causes a harmful interference of 0.44.
  - **Conclusion:** With policy P2, DOF-SR provides a performance gain of nearly 80% over Jello, but at the cost of increased interference to the co-existing WiFi radio.

### Conclusion

Historically, unlicensed band co-existence has been managed through social protocols, but with increasing radio density, more accurate and adaptive methods are needed. DOF provides a robust substrate for future ISM band radios, enabling them to coexist in crowded environments. Future work includes designing a generalized policy-aware smart radio and applying DOF to other network management, performance diagnosis, and indoor localization applications.
