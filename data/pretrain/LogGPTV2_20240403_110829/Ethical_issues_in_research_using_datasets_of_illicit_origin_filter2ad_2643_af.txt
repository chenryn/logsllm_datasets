### Many More Safeguards Exist, But Are Not Explicitly Mentioned

In general, researchers appear to be more hesitant to discuss the potential harms of their work compared to its benefits. Privacy preservation is one of the most frequently applied safeguards, as it is relatively straightforward to implement (e.g., by refusing to de-anonymize datasets or by not revealing private information). Only four of the papers discussed controlled sharing (CS). To maximize the benefit, research papers need to be reproducible. While open data is often not appropriate for data of illicit origin, controlled sharing of data with other researchers is crucial. It is possible that authors would be willing to share their data if asked, and mentioning this increases the likelihood of such sharing.

Controlled sharing does come with costs, as it places a burden on the authors to establish a robust legal framework and to continuously vet requests for data access. However, these costs can be delegated, for example, through initiatives like IMPACT in the USA or the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre in the UK.

### Conclusion

It is common to see research using data of illicit origin, such as leaked databases or classified documents. These data provide researchers with the opportunity to test their hypotheses against real-world data, improving our understanding of issues like the evolution of malware or password reuse. This, in turn, helps to enhance cyber defenses and password policies. However, these data were originally collected through illicit means, and the research community must be aware of the ethical considerations involved in using such data.

By analyzing current advice and previous work on ethics, we have identified a set of ethical issues that should be considered and reported when publishing results based on data of illicit origin. However, there is a lack of consistency in the consideration of ethical issues, leading to cases where insufficient safeguards are used to prevent harm. Few authors consulted their institutional Research Ethics Board (REB), and in most cases, they were exempted on the basis that no human subjects were involved in the research. This narrow focus on whether the research involves "human subjects," rather than a risk-based analysis of potential harms, is unhelpful. If research has the potential to harm humans, even in the absence of direct human subjects, REB approval should be sought. REBs may need to adapt to understand the possible effects on humans of research in Information Communication Technology Research (ICTR) and to provide timely and well-informed responses.

In any case, papers using data of illicit origin should always include an ethics section, explaining how the data were obtained, how it has been protected, and analyzing the harms, benefits, and necessity of using such data. Conferences and journals should explicitly require such ethics sections and highlight the importance of considering ethics in their Calls for Papers. Researchers using data shared under acceptable usage policies should cite those policies, and data providers should make their acceptable usage policies publicly available. Additionally, current efforts to advise on ethics, such as the Menlo Report, should be updated and extended to provide more comprehensive coverage of ICTR and legal considerations to guide researchers aiming to use datasets of illicit origin. Ethics is an issue receiving greater interest within ICTR, and standards are improving. Therefore, we are hopeful that in the future, better information on current practice and better guidance will be available.
