that many more would apply but they were not mentioned
explicitly. In general, we observe that researchers appear to
be more reluctant to express the potential harms resulting
from their work than their beneﬁts.
Privacy preservation is one of the safeguards applied most
frequently, since it is easy to do (e.g. by refusing to attempt
to de-anomymize a data set or refusing to reveal private
information). Only four of the papers discussed controlled
sharing (CS). To provide the maximum beneﬁt, papers need
to be reproducible and so while open data is often not appro-
priate for data of illicit origin, controlled sharing of data with
researchers is important. It is possible the authors would
be willing to share if they were asked, but mentioning this
increases the likelihood it will happen. There is a cost in
controlled sharing as it places a burden on the authors of
the work to put a robust legal framework in place and an
ongoing cost of vetting requests to access the data. However,
this cost can be delegated, for example using initiatives such
as IMPACT [6;] in the USA or the Cambridge Cybercrime
Centre [42] in the UK.
8 CONCLUSION
It is common to see research using data of illicit origin, such
as leaked databases or classiﬁed documents. The use of
these data provide researchers with the opportunity to test
their hypotheses against ground truth data. For example, it
improves our understanding of the evolution of malware or
how users re-use passwords. This in turn helps to improve
cyber defenses or password policies. However, these data
were originally collected by illicit means, and the research
community must be aware of the ethical considerations of
using such data.
By analysing current advice and previous work on ethics,
we have drawn out a set of ethical issues that should be
considered and reported when publishing results based on
data of illicit origin. However, we have shown that there is
a lack of consistency in the consideration of ethical issues,
which results in cases where insuﬃcient safeguards are used
to prevent harm. Few authors consulted their institution
REB, and in most cases they were exempted on the basis
that there were no human subjects involved in the research.
This narrow focus on whether the research involves “human
subjects”, rather than a risk based analysis of the potential
harms to human participants is unhelpful. If research has
potential to harm humans, even in absence of direct human
subjects, REB approval should be sought. REBs may need to
adapt to understand the possible aﬀect on humans of research
in Information Communication Technology Research (ICTR),
and to provide timely and well informed responses.
In any case, papers using data of illicit origin should al-
ways have an ethics section, explaining how these data were
obtained, how it has been protected, analysing the harms,
beneﬁts, and need for using such data. Conferences and
journals should explicitly require such ethics sections and
highlight the importance of considering ethics in their Calls
for Papers. Researchers using data that has been shared
[7]
[9]
[:]
with them under acceptable usage policies should, as Allman
and Paxson suggest, cite the acceptable usage policy they
are operating under [6]. Data providers should make their
acceptable usage policies publicly available so that they can
be cited. Additionally, current eﬀorts to advise on ethics,
such as the Menlo Report [4:], should be updated and ex-
tended to provide a more comprehensive coverage of ICTR
and legal considerations to guide researchers aiming to use
datasets of illicit origin. Ethics is an issue that is receiving
greater interest within ICTR and standards are improving.
Hence, we are hopeful that in the future better information
on current practice, and better guidance, will be available.
