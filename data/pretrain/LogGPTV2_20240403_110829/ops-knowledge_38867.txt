User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Microsoft FTP fails to connect after the client requests the list of features (FEAT) This is a really weird problem. The first few times I try to connect FileZilla just hangs on the line 211-Extended features supported: for a while before coming up and saying Error: Could not connect to server. The FileZilla log below:

Command:    PASS ***********
Response:   230 User logged in.
Command:    FEAT
Response:   211-Extended features supported:
Error:  Could not connect to server


The weird thing is if I keep trying to connect eventually it just works and connects fine. After FileZilla knows which features the server supports it stops asking for a while which enables you to connect first time until FileZilla decides it wants to double check the features list again. I'm at a loss on how to debug this.

Has anyone experienced similar?

Assistant: I had the same problem using FTP for IIS with FileZilla and other clients. The root cause is still a mystery to me. However, if you manage the server, a workaround is to disallow the FEAT command.

For IIS 7.5: IIS Manager -> FTP Request Filtering -> Deny Command

I cannot advise regarding earlier IIS versions.

The server will then respond to FEAT with "500 'FEAT': command not allowed". FileZilla handles this gracefully and goes on to complete the connection.
