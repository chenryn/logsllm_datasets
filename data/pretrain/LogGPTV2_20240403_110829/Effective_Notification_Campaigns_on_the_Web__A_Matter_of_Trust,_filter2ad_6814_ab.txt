### Tracker Objects and Their Configuration on Websites

To detect tracker objects, including those from third parties (e.g., included through widgets), the checker iterates over all JavaScript global variables. For each variable, it evaluates the available methods and attributes. If these match the expected ones for `analytics.js` or `ga.js`, the checker identifies a Google Analytics (GA) object. This object can then be queried to retrieve information about available trackers and their configurations. These tracker objects are used in our self-service tool to provide users with detailed information about misconfigurations.

#### Methodology Overview

- **Detection of Tracker Objects**: The checker scans all JavaScript global variables to identify GA objects.
- **Configuration Retrieval**: Once identified, the GA object is queried for tracker details and configurations.
- **User Agent Modification**: To avoid detection, the user agent is modified to hide that Chromium is running headless.
- **Page Interaction**: The page is scrolled randomly at short intervals to trigger additional GA requests, simulating user interaction.
- **Consent Banners**: The presence of consent banners is not checked, as they could hide non-compliant GA instances until consent is confirmed. This may lead to false negatives, but the checker will not return false positives.

### Collecting Non-Compliant Websites

#### Data Collection

- **Sources**:
  - **German Wikipedia**: All `.de` TLD sites (N = 32,782).
  - **Toplists by Scheitle et al. [36]**: Merged and deduplicated historical (up to 10 years) Internet toplists, filtered for `.de` TLD (N = 1,265,750).

- **Compliance Check**:
  - **Wikipedia Sites**: 9.36% (3,070) were non-compliant.
  - **Toplist Sites**: 12.8% (161,984) were non-compliant.
  - **Random Sample**: 5,000 non-compliant toplist sites, minus 91 duplicates, resulting in 7,979 non-compliant sites.

- **Data Extraction**:
  - **Researchers' Task**: Three researchers independently collected postal and email addresses from the site’s imprint and assigned categories (e.g., company, individual, public sector, others).
  - **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts were resolved by majority vote.
  - **Average Time**: 75 seconds per site.

- **Exclusions**:
  - **Public Sector Sites**: 20% excluded due to GDPR fine exemptions.
  - **No Imprint**: 20% excluded.
  - **Non-German Addresses**: 20% excluded.
  - **Politicians' Sites**: <1% excluded.
  - **Inaccessible or Broken Sites**: 10% excluded.
  - **Compliant Sites After Rescan**: 30% excluded after rescanning all sites before sending notifications.

- **Co-Owned Sites**:
  - **Merging Criteria**: Sites with identical or similar postal addresses and email addresses.
  - **Final Count**: 4,754 sites run by 4,594 different owners, scanned four times daily during the study.

### Notification and Reminder

#### Experimental Design

- **Groups**:
  - **Contact Media**: LETTER and EMAIL.
  - **Senders**: CITIZEN, UNI-CS, and UNI-LAW.
  - **Framings**: PRIVACY, GDPR, and GDPR+FINE.

- **Message Content**:
  - **Language**: German.
  - **Self-Service Tool Reference**: Mentioned as an unaffiliated service.
  - **Contact Options**: Postal address, email, and phone number.

- **Messages**:
  - **Initial Notification**: Sent first.
  - **Reminder**: One month later if the problem was not addressed.
  - **Debriefing**: Final message one month after the reminder, informing recipients about the study and inviting them to a survey.

- **Human Error**: All UNI-LAW – LETTER reminders were sent with the GDPR+FINE framing, which will be discussed in Section 5.1.2.

### Self-Service Tool and Support

#### CheckGA Tool

- **Functionality**:
  - **Scan and Report**: Users can scan any website to check for GA tracker objects and their configurations.
  - **IP Anonymization**: Reports whether IP anonymization is enabled.
  - **Help Page**: Extensive documentation and code examples.

- **Data Storage**:
  - **Collected Data**: URL, scan result, time, truncated IP address, and TLS Session ID.
  - **Privacy**: Users informed about data collection before scanning.

- **Support**:
  - **Channels**: Phone, email, and occasionally letters.
  - **Services**: Verification of message authenticity, basic troubleshooting, and complaint handling.

### Survey

#### Survey Details

- **Platform**: soscisurvey.
- **Content**: Informed consent, perception of notification, problem awareness, and solving.
- **Questions**: Tailored to the recipient's group (medium, sender, framing, final compliance status).
- **Responses**: 561 owners participated; 84 responses excluded (19 did not agree to informed consent, 65 answered less than 50% of questions).
- **Analysis**: SPSS for quantitative data, MAXQDA for qualitative content analysis.

### Data Cleaning

- **Exclusions**:
  - **Frequently Changing Domains**: 31 websites excluded.
  - **WordPress.com Sites**: 22 sites excluded due to centrally-administrated GA tracker.
  - **Incorrectly Labeled Sites**: 2 domains excluded.
  - **Owner Requests**: 4 domains excluded upon request.

### Survival Analysis

- **Method**:
  - **Survival Function**: Kaplan-Meier estimator.
  - **Weighting**: Each website has a weight w = 1/|G|, where |G| is the number of websites run by the same owner.
  - **Remediation Event**: A website is considered compliant after c consecutive readings (c = 5, also tested with c = 3 and c = 8).

- **Statistical Tests**:
  - **Proportional Hazard Assumption**: Not met, so log(−log(·))-transform and Holm-Bonferroni multi-test correction are used.

### Ethical Considerations

- **Recipient Impact**: Messages aim to help recipients avoid costly mistakes, though processing may cause stress.
- **Infrastructure Load**: Normal page load for scans, minimal strain on infrastructure.
- **Dual-Use Potential**: CheckGA could be used for cease-and-desist letters, but benefits outweigh potential harms.
- **Ethics Approval**: Approved by ethics committees of two institutions and the dean of the third institution.

### Results

#### Notifications

- **Impact Analysis**:
  - **Initial Notification**: Sent from July 1st to 5th.
  - **Survival Analysis**: Detailed in Section 4.7.
