seen casually. An example of a subtlety would be a magician placing 
an object in one pocket, and removing the “same” (not really) object 
from another pocket, to perform a switch, e.g. a real pencil for a fake 
pencil.  
Hacking examples include steganography and other covert 
channels of information, such as exchanging information based on 
timing, or error responses.

 “
” – The term is based on the French term a temps 
originated by Robert-Houdin.17 It means an act or movement designed 
to divert the attention of the spectator. The more common term is 
misdirection. 
However, the implication is that timing is critical for misdirection. 
Time as a factor by itself can be used, sometimes called Time 
Misdirection.  Some magicians will prepare a year ahead of time, 
hoping the spectator forgets details. An example in the hacking work 
is to do port scans over long periods of time, say weeks or months. 
Misdirection occurs solely because of the extended use of time.

As others have reported, people focus on things that interest them. 
Well known demonstrations include Daniel J. Simmons “Gorilla on the 
Basketball Court” video.18   
People also ignore things that seem common, as demonstrated by 
Richard Wiseman with his “Amazing color changing card trick19,” 
where four other color changes occur undetected. 
These and many more principles can be used to improve 
misdirection and deception. I’ve already mentioned the importance of 
normalcy, which I call Vernon’s 
There are several corollaries to this principle. 
 – 
. The closer a substitution 
or action is to the actual object or motion, the more likely it will 
appear to be natural and therefore innocent.  
Magicians spend most of their time perfecting their illusions to 
make them seem as natural as possible. They practice with video 
cameras, and mirrors, to see how it looks to the viewer. They strive to 
eliminate everything unnatural. They test the illusions with friends 
before attempting the illusion for real. Weeks or months of practice 
are typical. Spending mere minutes to perfect something is just 
amateurish. 
Unnatural email is one of the biggest reasons phishing attempts 
fail. We laugh at spam with grammatical errors, because it looks so 
unnatural. The unnatural is suspicious. 
And the more the unnatural is hidden, or minimized, the better. 
Consider the task in making an exploit useful. First of all, it has to 
be successful. Causing the system to crash would hardly be deceptive. 
In actually increases suspicion. But let’s say the exploit works 100% of 
the time. However, it creates two log entries classified as errors or 
alarms. If you can reduce the number of alarms to one, that’s better. If 
you can eliminate any alarm, that’s better still. 
Or course, completely natural actions are best. Using valid 
authentication credentials, such as reusable passwords, is normal, and 
therefore is less suspicious than an exploit. Besides using authorized

credentials, credentials can be borrowed, such as the Pass-the-hash 
attack. Subtleties are better that sleights, if that is all that is needed.  
Therefore when hacking, attacks should mimic natural activities as 
much as possible to escape detection.  
Corollary #2 –Hide the unnatural. 
If the unnatural action cannot be eliminated, then hide it. Create 
conditions that make the unnatural action hard to see. Mike Murray 
realized the letters “cl” look like a “d”, and used the domain 
“orade.com” to impersonate the “oracle.com” domain. 20 He can 
therefore make a site that looks 99.99% like the actual site, except for 
a very small difference. 
Since magicians can usually control the performance, they can set 
up the illusion so the unnatural isn’t noticed. For example, the 
audience might not be allowed to be behind the magician.  
For hacking, if most of the security alerts are logged in one file, 
modifying the attack so the event is logged in another, rarely 
examined file, or less information is captured, is an improvement in 
deception. 
Payloads can be crafted so they seem more normal. Some exploits 
repeat the same character to create padding. This might create a log 
entry, and the padding may show up in the logfile. Patterns like 
“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” attract the eye. Changing the 
padding so it looks like a typical log entry makes the exploit harder to 
spot. One can modify Metasploit scripts, and other frameworks, to 
mimic natural patterns. For example, an exploit in a HTTP header 
overflow21 can be triggered when a number of headers are exceeded. A 
typical exploit would repeat a single header 31 times, while a more 
natural approach would use headers similar to normal use. Shellcode 
payloads can even be described in English,22 to escape detection. 
.
. If a magician can’t eliminate 
or hide anything unnatural, they find a way to justify it. Magicians can 
create situations that provide a reason for something odd.

Social engineers often use this principle. They create a situation 
can “justifies” some unusual event, such as posing as a colleague from 
another company who is trying to help a friend who is visiting. 
Corollary #4 –Make the unnatural natural.  
Repetition and false alarms reduce the unnaturalness of an attack. 
If some other event can cause the unnatural to happen, then increase 
the probability that this event can happen. 
Suppose you can make a failed exploit create the same log entry as 
a successful exploit. If you then make that failed exploit part of a 
script kiddie package, the target may see lots of these entries, and 
“know” that these are harmless, even when the real exploit left 
evidence.  
If all else 
fails, then the magician can create events that prevent the audience 
from seeing the unnatural. This is where misdirection is used. 
Of course one can use the “Look over there!” type of misdirection. 
But there are many other ways to do the same thing, which will be 
covered next.  
As a perfect illusion isn’t always possible, other techniques, 
especially misdirection, can be used. There are different types of 
misdirection. 
. This occurs when a performer tells the 
audience to look somewhere because something is about to happen.  
In other words, if the magician tells the audience to look at something, 
they usually do. This can be blatantly obvious (e.g. “Watch my hands!”) 
or subtle. If someone suspects misdirection, or bored by the topic of 
the misdirection, etc. they may ignore the attempt to control their 
attention.   
Hackers who like to taunt their victim can use Directed 
Misdirection, if it makes sense to the victim. Hackers can send an 
email or instant message saying “Have you checked if your server is 
still up? LOL” And of course the victim will then focus their attention 
on this. Some hackers have combined this with a fake (like a modified 
remote login program), and trick their victim into executing a Trojan 
horse, often combined with a Bluff as in this example.

 occurs when an event occurs that is 
unexpected. The reaction to an unusual event is attention, and 
immediate. To be successful the event has to be something that is of 
interest to the person being deceived, so if the event is interesting, the 
victim finds it hard to ignore.  
Magicians have several ways to do this. One well-known technique 
is to have an attractive assistant in a low-cut dress bend over showing 
cleavage. Asking a spectator a loaded question can also be used. 
Sometimes eyes alone can accomplish the desired action.23 
This distraction can be tailored to the individual, or type of 
individual24. The topic of the misdirection may be financial, sexual, 
physical, emotional, etc.  
A related principle, known to scam artists, is 
.  If 
you understand the victim’s interests and motivations, you can control 
what they look at and how they react. 
 is a variation that occurs when an 
object has such unusual qualities; attention is immediately drawn to 
it. A magician may bring out some device that looks unlike anything 
else. A server behaving in a strange fashion (such as randomly making 
noises) will draw attention. In this case the event is interesting 
because it is abnormal.
In system penetrations fire alarms have been used to distract the 
victims and hide the hacker’s activities. Other attacks may be based on 
social engineering, attacking the power and air conditioning25, or a 
denial of service against another server26. Having the anti-virus system 
attack the operating system is another technique27 
 occurs when there is something that will 
cause the victim to focus their attention when it is discovered. 
However, attention is not drawn to it beforehand. It sits there waiting. 
23 Magicians Harlan Tarbell and John Ramsey made famous comments about the importance of eyes in 
misdirection.

Magicians sometimes use these after an effect to confuse the 
spectator28 after an effect.  
One disadvantage on of this is that the timing is not always 
controlled. That is, the person may look at the wrong place at the 
wrong time. 
I will describe a hacking equivalent later. 
 occurs when a person is placed in a 
situation where they have limited perception, and this is used to 
prevent them from seeing a secret action. Spectators are brought up 
on stage, and it can be amusing when that spectator is fooled, yet 
everyone else sees how the trick is accomplished. Classic examples in 
magic includes 
29, Slydini’s 
, and Corinda’s 
. The hacking equivalent 
would be a “client” who complains about a problem that is only seen 
from their desktop. If the help-desk person remotely accesses that 
desktop, so they can verify what the “victim” sees, they are 
constrained to see when the client sees. The help desk person may be 
given access to a controlled environment, or through a different VPN 
tunnel. One can control experiences of the investigator, and hide other 
activities during this action. This is an application of the 
corollary  
Magicians often introduce delays 
between two events to make them seem unrelated. If two events are 
necessary to accomplish something, and if these two events occur 
days apart, and from two different IP addresses, the difficulty in 
correlating these events is harder. This is the 
corollary, and a variant of the 
 concept.
 – Magician Tony Slydini 
taught his students that large motions hide small motions. The 
hacking analogy is a large obvious hack will hide a small hack, if 
performed simultaneously. Exploiting one server while another is 
being DDoSed is an example. This is a way to accomplish 
corollary  
 – This applies to the 4th Corollary 
 Magicians will often repeat actions. Repetition 
causes relaxation, because the mind will filter out repetitious and 
unimportant actions. This may be done because the unusual action

can hide a secret sleight. By making the unusual action more “normal,” 
the sleight is less detectable. A hacker can use this by making an 
exploit very similar to an unusual, yet harmless action, and repeat the 
unusual action until it becomes more “natural” by repetition. A 
variation with an exploit may not be as easily detected.  
The investigator may examine the first few occurrences, and when 
it is determined that the actions are harmless, and there are large 
number of them, the investigator may not notice the single anomaly.  
 – A magician may act as if he is 
performing a sleight, when he is not. The observant spectator may 
assume a sleight is in progress. For instance, a magician may move an 
object from one hand to the other, but pretend that the object is still 
hidden in the first hand (Bluff). Typically the magician will later reveal 
that the hand really is empty, as a joke. The False Alarm also draws 
the attention of observant and intelligent spectators, and can be used 
by anticipating the victim’s reaction to suspicious moves. When it is 
discovered to be a false alarm, the victim often has to refocus their 
attention, and is more vulnerable to distraction at this time. However, 
there are times when it is not discovered to be false. This is described 
next.  
There are not many examples of this in the hacking community. An 
example could be running an exploit against a server when it’s already 
exploited. 
 - Another techniques magicians’ 
use is to create the situation so that the spectator draws a false 
conclusion on the technique used. The silk to hollow egg31 is one such 
effect, as is the “Backstage” illusion where the magician repeats the 
effect showing how it looks from the back. Of course as soon as the 
spectator understands how the effect works, the magician throws a 
spanner in the works, and by using another method the magician can 
fool the audience a second time. 
There are many variations of this effect, even when the spectator 
knows the technique. Magicians love to duplicate the same effect that 
use a gimmick, and they either use a different gimmick, or else use 
sleight of hand to replace the function of the gimmick, for the sole 
purpose of fooling those who know about the gimmick.  
Another technique some magicians use is to purposely create 
situations that suggest other methods are used. The spectator may
