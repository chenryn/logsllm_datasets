ABSTRACT
This paper addresses a novel anti-spam gateway targeting multiple
linguistic-based social platforms to expose the outlier property of
their spam messages uniformly for effective detection. Instead of la-
beling ground truth datasets and extracting key features, which are
labor-intensive and time-consuming, we start with coarsely mining
seed corpora of spams and hams from the target data (aiming for
spam classification), before reconstructing them as the reference.
To catch each word’s rich information in the semantic and syntac-
tic perspectives, we then leverage the natural language processing
(NLP) model to embed each word into the high-dimensional vec-
tor space and use a neural network to train a spam word model.
After that, each message is encoded by using the predicted spam
scores from this model for all included stem words. The encoded
messages are processed by the prominent outlier techniques to pro-
duce their respective scores, allowing us to rank them for making
the outlier visible. Our solution is unsupervised, without relying
on specifics of any platform or dataset, to be platform-oblivious.
Through extensive experiments, our solution is demonstrated to
expose spammers’ outlier characteristics effectively, outperform
all examined unsupervised methods in almost all metrics, and may
even better supervised counterparts.

1 INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, the ever-growing use of social platforms (e.g., social net-
works, emails, and others) brings great convenience to our daily life,
leading to our high reliance on them for communications, conver-
sations, or discussion. At the same time, it also pervasively attracts
spammers’ interests to spread spam messages or information, that
pollute the social platforms purposefully. Existing anti-spam mech-
anisms have filtered the majority of spam messages, leaving out
only a small portion. Nonetheless, spam messages that escape from
anti-spam mechanisms are still plentiful, and they continuously
cause gross detriments to the normal users. It remains challeng-
ing to detect and remove them for mitigating the cyberspace risks

and sanitizing social environments. Given the fact that spammers
inevitably exhibit behavioral patterns which differ considerably
from those of normal users, such a disparity never disappears once
spammy behaviors are undertaken. Furthermore, skillful spammers
may keep evolving to imitate normal users by concealing their
behaviors for abnormality reduction. As a result, it is imperative to
design an intelligent spam detection system for mining the latent
patterns and use them for classifying spammers automatically.
To date, various supervised learning methods have been pro-
posed for spam detection. By extracting effective features and re-
lying on labeled ground-truth datasets, the machine learning clas-
sifiers learn the latent disparity inherent to spam and ham (i.e.,
non-spam) messages. Extensive work has undertaken on extracting
various features, including user profiles [13], behaviors [23], mes-
sage contents [32, 54], user relationships [9, 49, 62], among others.
However, extracting key features has been widely recognized as a
challenging problem. In addition, all those features are tailored only
to a specific dataset or platform, with considerable effort involved
in deriving new customized features for every individual platform.
Furthermore, reliable large-sized ground-truth datasets are nec-
essary for supervised learning, but they represent another chal-
lenge. So far, there is no effective method for labeling a large-sized
dataset reliably. Moreover, the supervised methods may perform
poorly when applied to the real social networks data, where the
spam and ham messages are highly uneven, as revealed by promi-
nent research [29, 44, 52, 55]. Meanwhile, semi-supervised methods
[11, 18, 24] have been proposed to mitigate their reliance on the
ground-truth datasets. But, suitably sized ground-truth datasets
are still required, and one proposed solution generally performs
unsatisfactorily when applied to other platforms. Although diverse
unsupervised learning methods were pursued [28, 35, 50, 51] for
freeness from labeling datasets, they usually exhibit mediocre per-
formance.
To address the aforementioned concerns on feature extraction,
ground-truth labeling, cross-platform deployment, and unsatisfac-
tory performance, we aim to develop an effective platform-oblivious
framework for unsupervised spam detection. According to the fact
that spam messages account for a small portion of the total data
volume and that their patterns are fundamentally disparate in com-
parison to those from normal users, they can be easily detected and
removed, if exposed as the outliers of whole data volume. The promi-
nent outlier detection method proposed in [7] is effective in mining
the outlier property of a given dataset in three dimensions, i.e.,
Shapes, Magnitude, and Amplitude. However, not all spammers’ out-
lier characteristics are apparent, calling for an appropriate encoding
method to make spam messages visible in the three dimensions.
This paper introduces a novel spam detection approach by ex-
posing the outlier property of spams, deriving a platform-oblivious
framework to work in an unsupervised manner. Our approach is

unified and readily deployable to multiple linguistic-based social
platforms without involving extra effort individually. It relies on the
spam and ham words automatically mined from the target dataset
(aiming for spam classification), instead of the previously labeled
ground-truth dataset, to serve as the seed corpora of spams and
hams, respectively. A new method based on mining messages’ struc-
ture is proposed for automatically identifying the sets of spam seed
and ham seed corpora from the target dataset. We further refine
them with a series of techniques and then reconstruct them. Here,
the Gibbs sampling [36] is used to help us iteratively pre-label the
spam and ham datasets while sampling each word’s distribution
in the respective datasets. Such sampled word distributions are
used to calculate the spam scores of all words for reconstructing
both new spam and ham corpora. Furthermore, we employ the NLP
model to embed each word into the high-dimensional vector space
so that it can cover a rich set of words with the similar meanings
or structures. The neural network is then employed to learn the
high-dimensional representations of words and their associated
scores to train a spam word model, serving to predict other words’
spam scores in the target dataset.
Meanwhile, we represent each message in the target dataset by
a list of stem words, which are then inputted into the spam word
model to predict the spam scores, being used to encode this message.
In the end, Magnitude outlier approach stated in [7] is employed
with the input of encoded messages to calculate their outlier scores
for ranking them from the highest values to the lowest to exhibit
spams’ outlier property.
The contributions of our work are summarized as follows.
• We develop a novel anti-spam gateway that can clearly ex-
pose the outlier property of spam messages in the target
datasets. Our system is unsupervised without relying on fea-
ture extraction or ground-truth labeling, able to significantly
relieve the detection workload. Instead, our system utilizes
the target dataset to acquire the spam words, potentially
overcoming the spam feature drift problem to some extent.
• Our solution is unified for manifold linguistic-based social
platforms since it does not rely on any prior knowledge (e.g.,
features and training data) to mine linguistic information
and patterns. Thus, it is not tailored to any specific platform
and can be deployed and integrated into multiple platforms
to automatically conduct spam detection task, without addi-
tional effort individually. The experiments confirm that our
system works efficiently on the datasets from short message
service (SMS), Email, and Twitter, exposing spams as the
outliers of the respective dataset.
• We propose a novel technique to estimate both the spam
ratio in a dataset and the threshold value used for detecting
spams via the visualized outlier curve. Such a technique is
important, acting as a complement to the prior outlier tech-
nique, for automatically separating spam and ham regions.
• We implement our system and run it on four linguistic-based
datasets from various platforms. Experimental results show
that our system not only outperforms all examined unsuper-
vised solutions in almost all performance metrics under the
four datasets, but also may surpass its supervised counter-
parts, while avoiding ground-truth labeling costs.

lem space.
As an unsupervised spam detection solution, our proposed ap-
proach is readily applicable to datasets collected from a given social
platform at different time points without any labeling nor model pa-
rameter rectification effort at all, for time-invariant portability with
equally high accuracy. For example, our solution was applied both
to the set of 2, 094, 889 tweets collected over two days in November
2020, and to Twitter Normal Dataset [3] (with 5, 823, 230 tweets col-
lected in 2019, as detailed in Section 4.1). It reported 161,935 tweets
as spams and 1, 932, 954 as ham ones for the 2020 tweet dataset,
giving rise to the Precision and Recall being 86.3% and 82.4%, re-
spectively. The results are close to those obtained by our solution
on the 2019 Twitter Normal Dataset (which yielded the Precision
of 85.1% and the Recall of 78.4% as shown in Table 4). Hence, the
proposed solution confirms the clear advantage of an unsupervised
approach, able to be platform-oblivious and time-invariant. For the
rest of this paper, we focus on the platform-oblivious perspective of
our solution, knowing that its time-invariant feature holds equally.
2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
This paper studies the spam detection problem in social platforms
where users post and/or interact via linguistic information (i.e., mes-
sages) for discussion or conversation. By realizing that the spammy
behaviors of a spammer will inevitably expose some natures that
are disparate when compared to normal users’ patterns, we aim
to capture such an inherent nature and develop a novel platform-
oblivious solution for its detection. Our proposed solution is to
act as a complementary component to the commercial anti-spam
mechanisms (as shown in Figure 1), to further filter out the residual
spam messages that escape from existing commercial anti-spam
mechanisms.
2.1 Motivation
Nowadays, commercial anti-spam mechanisms have been widely
deployed in social platforms, which can block the majority of spam
messages [41, 45]. However, there remains a small portion and yet

tweets, with a total of 7 features (along the x-axis) considered, i.e.,
number of lists, number of favorites, number of statuses, number of
hashtags, username length, number of URLs, and user screen name
length. In this figure, red lines and blue lines indicate respectively
the spam and the ham tweets. It is observed that most spammers
exhibit themselves as outliers to some extent, with respect to the
values of these 7 features.
Figures 2 and 3 roughly exhibit a certain level of outlier property
for spams’ patterns when taking the proper features into account.
These results demonstrate that spam messages indeed have the
outlier property, thus motivating our development of a new spam
detection framework by exploring such property. Meanwhile, we
also observe some spam tweets still hide within the majority of
ham tweets. The reason is possibly due to the missing of some key
features or some spammers use sophisticated techniques to disguise
themselves, making their latent patterns inapparent. This signifies
that just selecting features to encode messages are inadequate.
It is necessary to develop a new encoding method to facilitate
dataset processing so that spam messages in the entire dataset
can be exposed as outliers. In this work, we aim to have a deep
investigation into mining the disparate patterns between spam
and ham messages, for exposing the outlier characteristics of spam
messages in order to make them detectable. Our solution is expected
to be platform-oblivious, applicable to multiple linguistic-based
social platforms without rectification.
3 PLATFORM-OBLIVIOUS FRAMEWORK
In this section, we develop a platform-oblivious unsupervised sys-
tem that can be generally applied to different social platforms for
effectively singling out spam messages. Our system consists of the
following core components (shown in Figure 4): i) Rough Seed col-
lection (Section 3.1), ii) Reconstructing words corpora (Section 3.2),
iii) Training spam word model (Section 3.3), and iv) Outlier detection
(Section 3.4). Given any target dataset aiming for spam detection,
Section 3.1 proposes two measures to capture spam and ham’s
unique structures, respectively, in the target dataset, for helping
to roughly collect the spam and ham seed corpora. Section 3.2 nar-
rates the procedure for reconstructing spam and ham corpora by
leveraging the Gibbs sampling method [36] with our customized
design. Section 3.3 first details that each word in the reconstructed
corpora is embedded into the high dimensional vector space so as
to reflect its richer syntactic and semantic patterns, thereby able to
help cover a set of words that have the similar structure or meaning.
The neural network is then employed to train a spam word model
with the input of word vectors and the output of associated scores.
In Section 3.4, we use the trained spam model to predict the spam
scores of all stem words included in each message from the target
dataset and use them to encode this message. Then, the Magnitude
outlier approach [7] is employed by taking the encoded messages
as input to expose the outlier property of spam messages.
3.1 Seed Collection
Without the labeled ground truth for training, some patterns show-
ing the disparity between spams and hams have to be identified first
as the reference for distinguishing them in the design of our un-
supervised solution. Since spammers typically use certain specific

users, causing them to stand out.

unignorable amounts that can escape from these mechanisms, per-
vasively polluting the social environments and causing cyberspace
risks. We observe that although spammers imitate the normal users
to conceal their spammy activities, their special behaviors inevitably
reveal inherent disparities with respect to the majority of normal
dataset, which can exhibit outlier characteristics detectable through
deep analyses.
Our empirical feat has unveiled that the outlier nature indeed
exists when analyzing some labeled ground truth datasets. For
example, [3] outlines a set of labeled tweets collected from Twitter
networks. We randomly select 189 tweets and analyze the number
of URLs included in each tweet. Figure 2 shows the numbers of URLs
