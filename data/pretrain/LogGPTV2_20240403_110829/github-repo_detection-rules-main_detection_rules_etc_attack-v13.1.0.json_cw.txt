### Authentication Package (T1131)

**Description:**
Windows Authentication Package DLLs are loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. They provide support for multiple logon processes and security protocols.

**Persistence:**
Adversaries can use LSA Authentication Packages for persistence by placing a reference to a binary in the Windows Registry location `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\` with the key value of "Authentication Packages". The binary will then be executed when the authentication packages are loaded.

**Detection:**
- Monitor the Registry for changes to LSA keys.
- Monitor the LSA process for DLL loads.
- Set the Registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\LSASS.exe` with `AuditLevel = 8` to generate events for unsigned DLLs.

### Extra Window Memory Injection (T1181)

**Description:**
Graphical Windows-based processes must register a window class, which can include a request for extra window memory (EWM). EWM can store data specific to a window and has API functions to set and get its value.

**Malware Use:**
Malware may use EWM to point to a window procedure, write code to shared sections of the processâ€™s memory, and invoke execution by returning control to the address in the EWM.

**Execution:**
- May take place in the address space of a separate live process.
- Can bypass protection mechanisms like data execution prevention (DEP).

**Detection:**
- Monitor for API calls related to EWM, such as `GetWindowLong` and `SetWindowLong`.
- Watch for `SendNotifyMessage` to trigger the associated window procedure.
