TECH BRIEF
Accomplish the Mission
With a foothold within the organization and communication channels to direct activities, the adversary has
established persistence and can take steps to accomplish its mission. At this stage, advanced threat activities
come from valid user accounts and systems that are trusted within the environment.
Advanced Threat Detection and Response
In the advanced threat attack lifecycle, there is an adversary that would like to get into your environment and has
an objective against your business. This adversary is motivated and resourced. They utilize multiple attack vectors
and techniques to get onto your systems, exploit the trusted access that system has in your network, stay on
your systems, and steal from your organization or damage your business. Activities can include lateral movement
(find and take over additional endpoints and systems). The adversary uses valid credentials to gain access to
endpoints, systems and asset stores. Objectives can include modifying, viewing and stealing information, as well
as selling access to your organization. The adversary will want to hide and maintain persistence.
Having access to and analyzing all data can be helpful in detecting and responding to advanced threats.
Monitoring for known attacks and unusual activity, and then linking them together using the kill chain method,
can help identify compromised hosts and advanced threats that have gotten into your organization. This
approach focuses on detecting post-exploit/infection activities with the assumption that an adversary has gotten
into the environment (assume you’ve been compromised). The following examples illustrate techniques to look
for compromised hosts and could play an important part of breach response and malware/APT hunting.

• What to look for: Short file names
• Why to look for it: Attacker wants to run a program that avoids detection
• Source data required: Endpoint/system logs; file names are in a field called ‘file’
