User: 请选择TimeSeriesClassification领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Analyze the following time series
[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.3,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.7]
Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Unable to determine
B: Periodic
C: Stationary
D: Sparse
