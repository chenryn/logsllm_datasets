User: I would like to pass my database connection to the EchoHandler class, however I can't figure out how to do that or access the EchoHandler class at all.


class EchoHandler(SocketServer.StreamRequestHandler):
    def handle(self):
        print self.client_address, 'connected'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    conn = MySQLdb.connect (host = "10.0.0.5", user = "user", passwd = "pass", db = "database")

    SocketServer.ForkingTCPServer.allow_reuse_address = 1

    server = SocketServer.ForkingTCPServer(('10.0.0.6', 4242), EchoHandler)

    print "Server listening on localhost:4242..."
    try:
        server.allow_reuse_address
        server.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print "\nbailing..."
Assistant: It seems that you can't use ForkingServer to share variables because Copy-on-Write happens when a process tries to modify a shared variable.
Change it to ThreadingServer and you'll be able to share global variables.
