User: I've run into an issue and am looking for guidance from a few veterans. I've written a program in python that I'd like to run only periodically. I'm going to upload it to my sever, and what I'd like for it to do is to run every Monday through Friday, and every 5 minutes between 9:30 and 4. 
Basically I've written modules to query the market, and evaluate securities that I own. I don't want to tax the servers, so every 5 minutes should be fine. 
What I want is some advice on how I should arrange the main sequence. Should I run the program from a continuous loop that just checks the time? Or should I run the code, scheduled from a daemon? Thoughts?
Assistant: cron can easily handle that timing (although 2 entries will be required), so unless you have extreme low-latency requirements it's best to have it invoke the script on demand.
