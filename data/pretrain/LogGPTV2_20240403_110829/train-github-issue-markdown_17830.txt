Launch an iOS application with a light-colored launch screen storyboard and a
light-colored home view. Note that a frame or two of total black is shown
between the launch screen and the initial Flutter view.
This is my workaround for now, in the app delegate:
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        FlutterViewController *controller = (FlutterViewController*)self.window.rootViewController;
        controller.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
        [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
        return YES;
    }
