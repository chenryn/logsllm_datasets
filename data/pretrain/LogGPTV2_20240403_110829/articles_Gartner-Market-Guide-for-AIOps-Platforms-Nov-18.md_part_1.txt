By Analysts Pankaj Prasad, Charley Rich
AIOps platforms enhance IT operations through greater insights by combining big data,
machine learning and visualization. I&O leaders should initiate AIOps deployment to refine
performance analysis today and augment to IT service management and automation over the
next two to five years.
Overview
Key Findings
■ AIOps is getting entrenched in enterprises predominantly for IT operations, while some of the
more mature organizations are using the technology to provide insights to business leaders.
■ AIOps skills and IT operations maturity are the usual inhibitors in ensuring quick time to value
when using these tools, followed by data quality as an emerging challenge for some of the
more mature deployments.
■ Enterprises adopting AIOps platforms use it to enhance and, occasionally, augment classical
application performance monitoring (APM) and network performance monitoring and
diagnostics (NPMD) tools.
■ Vendors are developing strategies to use machine learning — the primary technology within
AIOps — to analyze data challenges for IT operations across the three dimensions of volume,
variety and velocity. At the same time, they are building specialization across both data storage
and AI practices.
Recommendations
I&O leaders responsible for optimizing IT operations should:
■ Deploy AIOps by adopting an incremental approach that starts with historical data, and
progress to the use of streaming data, aligned with a continuously improving IT operations
maturity.
■ Select platforms that enable comprehensive insight into past and present states of IT systems
by identifying AIOps platforms that are capable of ingesting and providing access to text and
metric data.

■ Deepen their IT operations team’s analytical skills by selecting tools that support the ability to
incrementally deploy the four phases of IT-operations-oriented machine learning: descriptive,
diagnostic, proactive capabilities and root cause analysis to help avoid high-severity outages.
Market Definition
AIOps platforms combine big data and machine learning functionality to support all primary IT
operations functions through the scalable ingestion and analysis of the ever-increasing volume,
variety and velocity of data generated by IT. The platform enables the concurrent use of multiple
data sources, data collection methods, and analytical and presentation technologies.
Market Description
AIOps can enhance a broad range of IT operations processes and tasks, including performance
analysis, anomaly detection, event correlation and analysis, IT service management and
automation.
Their central function is:
■ Ingesting data from multiple sources agnostic to source or vendor
■ Enabling data analytics at two points:
■ Real-time analysis at the point of ingestion
■ Historical analysis of stored data
■ Providing access to the data
■ Storing the acquired data
■ Using machine learning
■ Initiating an action or next step based on the result of analysis
The goal of the analytics effort is the discovery of patterns — novel elements used to look forward
in time to predict possible incidents and emerging usage profiles — and to look backward in time
to determine the root causes of current system behaviors (see Figure 1).

Market Direction
AI technology has influenced the evolution of ITOM intermittently over the past two decades, and
AIOps platforms are only the most recent example of that influence. IT operations is challenged by
the opposing forces of cost reduction on one hand and increasing operations complexity on the
other. The complexity can be defined across the three dimensions of volume, variety and velocity
as:
■ Rapid growth in data volumes generated by the IT infrastructure and applications (two- to three-
fold increase per annum)
■ The increasing variety of data types generated by machines and humans (for example, metrics,
logs, wire data and documents [knowledge management])
■ The increasing velocity at which data is generated as well as the increasing rate of change
within IT architectures due to the adoption of cloud-native or other ephemeral architectures
A trade-off in any of these dimensions will prove costly given the insights required by a modern
business. Existing monitoring tools are stressed when dealing with high volume, variety and
velocity of data. More importantly, monitoring tools do not cut across the multiple data types
required for extracting useful insights. For example, the business needs enormous amounts of
data that cuts across infrastructure and application metrics, customer sentiment data, business
transaction data, sensor telemetry, and logs from various systems for additional insights.
Non-IT groups like line of business owners and teams that sit outside IT operations (such as
application developers and DevOps) are increasingly showing interest in AIOps technologies to
surface insights across a multitude of datasets (see “Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations
https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-5VNK3KA&ct=181130&st=sb 3/14

Delivers Improved Business Outcomes”). In some cases, security and IT operations teams are
exploring opportunities to leverage a common platform (see “Align NetOps and SecOps Tool
Objectives With Shared Use Cases”). The performance and maturity of the AIOps platform toward
enabling the multiple use cases across IT and security operations have been primary inhibitors
against a common platform deployment.
Further, the speed with which IT needs to act is also increasing due to digital business, hence the
need for tools that can help:
■ Reduce noise (for example, in the form of false alarms or redundant events)
■ Provide better causality, which helps identify probable cause of incidents
■ Capture anomalies that go beyond static thresholds to proactively detect abnormal conditions
■ Extrapolate future events to prevent potential breakdowns
■ Initiate action to resolve a problem (either directly or via integration)
To date, AIOps functionality has primarily been used in support of IT operations processes that
enable the monitoring or observation of IT infrastructure, application behavior or digital
experience. AIOps platform investments have almost always been justified on the basis of their
ability to decrease mean time to problem resolution. And they have been justified regardless of
whether this takes the form of using machine learning to deduplicate events in an event
management context or to analyze application log data in conjunction with bytecode-
instrumentation-based or distributed tracing data in an APM context.
AIOps platforms are expanding the range of data types they are capable of ingesting. In particular,
vendors that supported only the ingestion of log data in the past are now expanding their scope to
include metric and wire data.
Therefore, given both supply- and demand-side trends and technical differences, Gartner
anticipates that, over the next five years, wide-scope AIOps platforms will become the de facto
form-factor for the delivery of AIOps functionality as opposed to AIOps functionality embedded in
a monitoring tool like APM, NPMD or ITIM (see “Deliver Cross-Domain Analysis and Visibility With
AIOps and Digital Experience Monitoring”).
Gartner clients have demonstrated increasing interest in using AIOps functionality to improve
engagement with incidents and problems by applying big data and machine learning to trouble
ticketing to analyze the effectiveness of the service desk. 1 , 2
IT organizations have also started exploring AIOps in a DevOps context as part of the continuous
integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) cycle to predict potential problems prior to deployment
and to detect potential security issues 3 (see “Market Guide for Continuous Configuration
Automation Tools”).

AIOps analysis is expanding beyond its initial usage as a better solution for event correlation and
analysis in IT operations. I&O leaders are beginning to focus on use cases beyond the realm of IT
operations. As an example, since January 2018, Gartner clients have expressed interest in
designing dashboards showing real-time analysis of customer satisfaction, the order process and
business health. 4 The goal in this case is to present line of business owners with real-time
insights into the impact of IT on business, keeping them informed and enabling them to make
decisions based on relevant data.
Gartner believes that AIOps will evolve into a bidirectional solution that not only ingests data for
analysis, but also initiates actions based on its analysis. These actions, most likely via integration
to other ITOM and ITSM tools, will take several forms, including:
■ Alerting
■ Problem triage
■ CMDB population
■ Run book automation
■ Application release orchestration
AIOps tools show a “right-shift” across the four stages of monitoring — data acquisition,
aggregation, analysis and action (see Figure 2) — with their core capabilities at data aggregation
and analysis. As the technology matures further, users will be able to leverage proactive advice
from the platform, enabling the action stage.
With increasing instrumentation in modern applications, data acquisition as a native application
capability is leveraged by some organizations. In addition, some users leverage open-source
technologies for the data acquisition function, thereby bypassing APM as a specialized domain
monitoring tool and using AIOps as the primary source for the monitoring function.
The debate regarding monitoring tools versus AIOps has just begun, and it will likely grow.
Nevertheless, in the long run, monitoring tools will exist for the domain specialist, whereas, for an
IT operations generalist, the primary go-to tool will be AIOps.

Market Analysis
To date, few vendors offer comprehensive, integrated AIOps platforms. Many vendors do, however,
offer a wide range of AIOps capabilities, subsets of which are integrated with one another. To get
a clearer picture of how the market is evolving and where vendors are positioned with regard to
one another, Gartner has divided currently available AIOps capabilities into two major categories
across data management and analytical outcomes:
Data Ingestion and Handling
■ Historical and streaming data management — Software or appliances that allow for the
ingestion, indexing and persisted storage of log data, wire data, metrics and document data
(see Note 2). The resulting databases are mostly unstructured or polystructured, while the
stored datasets accumulate in high volumes, change with high velocity and are implicitly
structured according to highly varied formats. This historical data management functionality
can be called “big data management.” To provide value under the IT operations use case, the
tool must also present data in time scales perceived by a human user as real time, delivering
data directly at the point of ingestion without requiring access to a persisted database. It must
provide a coherent analysis across multiple streams of real-time and historical data.
Analytical Outcomes
■ Basic and advanced statistical analysis— A combination of univariate and multivariate
analysis, including the use of correlation, clustering, classifying and extrapolation on metrics
captured across IT entities as well as for curating data at source.
■ Automated pattern discovery and prediction — Use of historical or streaming data of one or
more of the types mentioned above, to elicit mathematical or structural patterns that describe
https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-5VNK3KA&ct=181130&st=sb 6/14
20/02/2019 Gartner Reprint
novel correlations that may be inferred from, but are not immediately present in, the datasets
themselves. These patterns may then be used to go forward in time and predict incidents with
varying degrees of probability.
■ Anomaly detection — Using the patterns discovered by the previous components to first
determine what constitutes normal system behavior, and then to discern departures from that
normal system behavior.
■ Root cause determination — Pruning down the network of correlations established by the
automated pattern discovery and prediction component to isolate those links of dependency
that represent genuine causal relationships in the sense of providing recipes for effective
intervention.
■ Prescriptive advice — Performing triage on problems, classifying them into known categories. It
may then mine stores of prior solutions, analyzing these for applicability and offering them in a
prioritized form for usage of remediation. Eventually, these will use a closed-loop approach and
enable voting on their effectiveness after they are utilized.
■ Topology— For the patterns AIOps detects to be relevant and actionable, a context must be
placed around the data ingested. That context is topology. Without the context and de facto
constraint of topology, the patterns detected, while valid, may be unhelpful and distracting.
Deriving patterns from data within a topology will reduce the number of patterns, establish
relevancy and illustrate hidden dependencies. Using topology as part of causality determination
can greatly increase its accuracy and effectiveness. Capturing where events occurred and their
up and downstream dependencies using graph and bottleneck analysis can provide great
insight on where to focus remediation efforts.
There is some confusion in the market concerning whether AIOps will replace domain-centric
monitoring tools such as APM, NPMD, ITIM and DEM (see “Hype Cycle for IT Performance
Analysis, 2018”). AIOps will not replace monitoring tools, rather it will provide enhanced analytics
