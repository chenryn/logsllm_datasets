### **Overview**
AIOps platforms enhance IT operations by providing deeper insights through the integration of big data, machine learning, and visualization. Infrastructure and Operations (I&O) leaders should initiate AIOps deployment to refine performance analysis and augment IT service management and automation over the next two to five years.

### **Key Findings**
- **Enterprise Adoption:** AIOps is becoming a standard in enterprises, primarily for IT operations. More mature organizations are leveraging AIOps to provide insights to business leaders.
- **Challenges:** The primary barriers to quick value realization with AIOps tools are the lack of AIOps skills, IT operations maturity, and data quality, especially in more advanced deployments.
- **Enhancement and Augmentation:** Enterprises adopting AIOps platforms use them to enhance and occasionally augment traditional Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Network Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics (NPMD) tools.
- **Vendor Strategies:** Vendors are developing strategies to use machine learning to address IT operations data challenges across volume, variety, and velocity. They are also building specialized capabilities in data storage and AI practices.

### **Recommendations for I&O Leaders**
- **Incremental Deployment:** Start with historical data and gradually progress to streaming data, aligning with continuous improvements in IT operations maturity.
- **Comprehensive Insight:** Select platforms that offer comprehensive insight into past and present states of IT systems, capable of ingesting and providing access to text and metric data.
- **Analytical Skills Development:** Choose tools that support the incremental deployment of IT-operations-oriented machine learning phases: descriptive, diagnostic, proactive capabilities, and root cause analysis to prevent high-severity outages.

### **Market Definition**
AIOps platforms combine big data and machine learning to support all primary IT operations functions. They enable scalable ingestion and analysis of the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data generated by IT. These platforms can concurrently use multiple data sources, collection methods, and analytical and presentation technologies.

### **Market Description**
AIOps enhances a wide range of IT operations processes, including performance analysis, anomaly detection, event correlation, IT service management, and automation. Key functions include:
- **Data Ingestion:** From multiple sources, agnostic to the source or vendor.
- **Data Analytics:** Real-time and historical analysis.
- **Data Access and Storage:** Providing and storing acquired data.
- **Machine Learning:** Using ML to discover patterns and predict incidents.
- **Action Initiation:** Taking action based on the results of the analysis.

The goal is to discover patterns that predict future incidents and determine the root causes of current system behaviors.

### **Market Direction**
AI technology has influenced ITOM over the past two decades, with AIOps platforms being the latest example. IT operations face the dual challenge of cost reduction and increasing operational complexity, defined by:
- **Volume:** Rapid growth in data volumes from IT infrastructure and applications.
- **Variety:** Increasing diversity of data types generated by machines and humans.
- **Velocity:** Faster data generation and changing IT architectures due to cloud-native and ephemeral architectures.

Existing monitoring tools struggle with high volume, variety, and velocity of data, and do not effectively integrate multiple data types. Non-IT groups, such as line-of-business owners and DevOps teams, are increasingly interested in AIOps for insights across various datasets. Security and IT operations teams are exploring common platforms to leverage shared use cases.

### **Use Cases and Future Trends**
- **Noise Reduction:** Reducing false alarms and redundant events.
- **Causality Identification:** Identifying probable causes of incidents.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Proactively detecting abnormal conditions.
- **Future Event Prediction:** Preventing potential breakdowns.
- **Action Initiation:** Resolving problems directly or via integration.

AIOps functionality is primarily used for IT operations processes, justified by their ability to reduce mean time to problem resolution. Vendors are expanding the range of data types they can ingest, and Gartner anticipates that wide-scope AIOps platforms will become the standard form-factor for delivering AIOps functionality over the next five years.

### **Market Analysis**
- **Data Ingestion and Handling:** Includes historical and streaming data management, allowing for the ingestion, indexing, and persistent storage of log, wire, metric, and document data.
- **Analytical Outcomes:** Includes basic and advanced statistical analysis, automated pattern discovery, anomaly detection, root cause determination, prescriptive advice, and topology.

There is some confusion about whether AIOps will replace domain-centric monitoring tools like APM, NPMD, ITIM, and DEM. AIOps will not replace these tools but will provide enhanced analytics and insights.
