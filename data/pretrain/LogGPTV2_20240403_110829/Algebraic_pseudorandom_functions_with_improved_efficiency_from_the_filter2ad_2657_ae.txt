If y R← GT, then y∗ is distributed randomly in GT. How-
ever, if y = e(g, u)1/x, then, y∗ is F (sk, b∗) = e(h, u)1/xn
.
Therefore, it suﬃces B to answer A’s query with y∗.
Guess: Algorithm A makes more queries, if required, to
which B responds as before, and then ﬁnally outputs a guess
bit b(cid:48) ∈ {0, 1}. B outputs b(cid:48) as its guess.
Abort probability. B aborts when the ﬁnal query is not equal
to b∗. Since b∗ is chosen at random from [(cid:96)]n, this happens
with probability (cid:96)−n. B might abort earlier if one of the ear-
lier queries is b∗, but that implies that the ﬁnal query is not
equal to b∗ which is already considered before. Therefore,
adv [B, G] ≥ VRFadv[A, F ]
.
BDH(n(cid:96))
(cid:96)n
As in [18], we choose [(cid:96)] such that (cid:96) = poly(λ), and n =
O(1). Now, any eﬃcient adversary that has non-negligible
advantage in distinguishing the VRF from a truly random
function can be used to construct an adversary B that breaks
n(cid:96)-BDH with non-negligible advantage. Hence, under the
n(cid:96)-BDH assumption, the VRF described in section 6.2 is a
secure VRF.
7. VRFS WITH LARGE INPUT DOMAINS
In this section, we show how to construct a secure VRF
with an input domain of {0, 1}m for arbitrary m. Secu-
rity depends on the O(m)-BDH assumption. Evaluating the
VRF requires about 32m multiplications and one exponen-
tiation. Our construction uses error correcting codes with a
large minimum distance.
Deﬁnition 7. A (m, n, d)(cid:96)-error correcting code is a code
H : {0, 1}m → [(cid:96)]n such that for every two codewords c1, c2 ∈
[(cid:96)]n, we have:
HDist(c1, c2) ≥ d,
where HDist(·,·) denotes the hamming distance between the
codewords (the number of co-ordinates where the two code-
words diﬀer).
We need the following lemma from [14].
Lemma 10. For any positive integers (cid:96), m, let n = 8m(cid:96).
Then there exists a (m, n, d)(cid:96)-error correcting code with d >
n(1 − 2/(cid:96)).
In particular, for the construction of the VRF it suﬃces
to take (cid:96) = 4. Therefore,
Corollary 11. For any positive integer m, there exists a
(m, n, d)4-error correcting code with d > n/2 and n = 32m.
7.1 VRF construction
Algorithm Gen(1λ): Choose a group G of prime order p
with a bilinear pairing. Select random generators g, u ∈ G,
random values s1, s2, . . . , sn ∈ Zp and set ti = gsi . Let
n = 32m. Choose a suitable (m, n, n/2)4-error correcting
code H : {0, 1}m → [4]n. The keys are:
pk = (G, p, g, u, t1, . . . , tn),
sk = (g, u, s1, . . . , sn).
Function F : (G2 × Zn
a bit string x = (x1, x2, . . . , xm) output:
p ) × {0, 1}m → GT. On input sk and
g[1/(cid:81)n
i=1(H(x)i+si)], u
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
F (sk, x) := e
where H(x)i refers to the ith coordinate of H(x).
Algorithm Prove(sk, x): Upon input sk and x output F (sk, x)
along with a proof π as follows. For i = 1 to n, compute
πi = g[1/(cid:81)i
j=1(H(x)j +sj )]. Output the proof:
π := (π1, π2, . . . , πn) ∈ Gn .
Algorithm Verify(pk, x, y, π): First verify that π contains
legal encodings of elements in G. Next, check that:
e(πi, gH(x)i · ti) = e(πi−1, g),
where π0 := g. Finally, check that e(πn, u) = y, where y is
the output of the VRF. Verify returns 1 iﬀ all the checks are
true.
The following theorem proves security of the construction.
The complete proof is given in the full version of the paper.
Theorem 12. If H : {0, 1}m → [4]n is a (m, 32m, d)4-error
correcting code with d > n/2, the VRF constructed earlier is
secure under the 256m-BDH (or equivalently the 8n-BDH)
assumption.
i ), for randomly chosen b∗
Proof Outline. Recall the intuition behind the proof of The-
orem 9. Given an 8n-BDH instance, construct an 2n × 4
matrix where the (i, j)th entry corresponds to the monomial
(x + j − b∗
i . In the proof of The-
orem 9 the public parameters were constructed to enable
the simulator to answer any query that does not visit all
2n mines. An adversary whose special query visits all the
mines can be used to solve the 8n-BDH instance. Since the
fraction of queries that cannot be answered by the simulator
is exponentially small in n (i.e., 8−n), this proof technique
works only for small n.
In this proof, for a parameter k, we choose a random inte-
ger r ∈ [k, n] and modify the public parameters construction
to enable the simulator to answer queries only if the query
visits no more than r mines. k is chosen so that the chal-
lenger fails on a 1/n fraction of all possible inputs with high
probability, which can then be used to break the 8n-BDH
assumption. This requires k to be O(log Q). To mitigate
an adversary forcing the simulator to abort by constructing
highly correlated queries, a random code with large mini-
mum distance is used which lower bounds the success prob-
ability to at least Ω(1/n) which is suﬃcient for the simula-
tion.
7.2 Simulatable VRFs
Chase and Lysyanskaya [15] introduced simulatable VRFs
(sVRF), which they used to convert single-theorem non-
interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) to many-theorem NIZK.
139Their simulatable VRF, secure under the k-BDH assump-
tion and the subgroup decision assumption (SDA), has a
polynomial size domain. We brieﬂy outline how the aug-
mented cascade gives a large-domain sVRF using the same
assumptions.
The augmented cascade theorem generalizes to sVRFs and
can be used to construct large-domain sVRFs from small-
domain ones, provided the underlying sVRF has parallel-
security. The simulatability of the sVRF makes it possible
to push the hybrid proof of the augmented cascade (The-
orem 3) to the settings of sVRFs. We note that this was
not possible for VRFs since the simulator cannot provide
proofs in the hybrid experiments. Now, plugging the Chase-
Lysyanskaya sVRF into this augmented cascade, we obtain
a large-domain sVRF.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We presented a generalization of the cascade construc-
tion called the augmented cascade. We used the augmented
cascade to construct large-domain PRFs from small-domain
algebraic PRFs. The augmented cascade provides a uniﬁed
framework for analysing the constructions of Naor-Reingold
and Lewko-Waters. We used the augmented cascade to ex-
tend the Dodis-Yampolskiy PRF to a PRF on large domains,
resulting in the most eﬃcient algebraic PRF to date.
The new large-domain PRF can be converted into a large-
domain VRF in a bilinear group and proven secure based on
the m-BDH assumption for some parameter m that depends
on the domain size. For small domains the resulting VRF
uses a weaker assumption than its Dodis-Yampolskiy origin.
We obtain a large domain VRF using error correcting codes.
The algebraic structure of these constructions will likely ﬁnd
many applications, as was the case for the Naor-Reingold
PRF. As an example, we brieﬂy noted a simulatable-VRF
for large domains.
