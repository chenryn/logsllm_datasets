plots. Their largest separations are, in order, 12%, 19%,
26%, and 28%. These large diﬀerences combined together
can form a cascade ﬁlter that helps us diﬀerentiate more
eﬀectively between these two users who at ﬁrst glance appear
somewhat alike.
6.3 Data Collection
As mentioned, the six overarching driving events are fun-
damentally diﬀerent forms of acceleration. Increasing speed,
cruising, coasting, and breaking are all acceleration at vary-
ing magnitudes along the y-axis of the vehicle as illustrated
in Figure 3. From the frame of reference of the car, turning
and lane changes create force along the x-axis. For this rea-
son we chose the accelerometer hardware in mobile devices
to collect data on acceleration in each dimension. Also nec-
essary is velocity information so that the acceleration can
be partitioned according to speed ranges as just discussed,
so we included GPS hardware as well, which can provide
velocity as the time-derivative of its gathered position data.
As acceleration is the time-derivative of velocity, the GPS
data can also provide acceleration data, but along the car’s
y-axis only. Having two sources of acceleration data, we can
use each to verify the other for the sake of accuracy.
We developed an Android application on the Nexus 5 to
collect and archive driving trace data, and distributed this
430among our volunteers so they could gather data while driv-
ing for a short time. This application records continuously
the global position of the device and the forces acting upon
it in each direction. GPS data was queried as frequently as
possible, which was roughly once per second; accelerometer
data was gathered at the device’s speciﬁed “normal” rate of
50 Hz. Both sets of data were recorded with their respective
timestamps to be later retrieved from the device for analysis.
6.4 Driving Event Extraction
The two sets of data aggregated from GPS and accelerom-
eter oﬀer two sources of acceleration information. First, ac-
celeration is directly measured by the accelerometer, and
second, it can be calculated from the GPS position data.
The diﬀerence between these two sources require diﬀerent
processing to produce driving events, which is detailed in
their respective sections below.
6.4.1 Acceleration Events Sensed by Accelerometer
No calculation is required to render acceleration values
from the accelerometer data, but due to variations in par-
ticipants’ positioning of the device collecting data, some nor-
malization is required. For example, we need to ensure the
average of the y-component of acceleration is close to zero,
as it should be when the beginning and ending velocities
are zero. Almost all data was collected with the device sit-
ting in the passenger seat, which in modern cars has a very
small incline when looking forward, so the y-acceleration
trace would commonly be reduced by a scalar constant so
that its average would be close to zero. Such a calibration
is acceptable, but too large of an incline spreads the force
over more than just the y-axis, so we ignore any such data
to avoid invalid comparison with properly collected data.
Noting again that the y-axis acceleration trace should av-
erage zero, positive acceleration events are identiﬁed as be-
ginning at a point whose moving average is larger than a
standard deviation more than the overall average of zero.
They continue while the acceleration remains above zero.
We discovered that some noise caused by the vibration of
the car (which was uniform amongst all users’ data) pre-
vented separation of coasting and braking, so we treated an
overall deceleration event type as the combination of the two
events. These deceleration events are thematically the same
as positive acceleration events, but start at the point whose
moving average is more than a standard deviation below the
average of zero. Following these speciﬁcations, all points
in the y-axis acceleration trace which are not identiﬁed as
positive acceleration or deceleration events represent cruis-
ing events, because speed is maintained when acceleration is
near zero. If the velocity is zero as calculated from the GPS
data, the accelerometer data is discarded to avoid including
time spent stationary at stoplights for example.
Turning and lane changes involve perpendicular force, as
mentioned, so we look to the x-axis data for their detection.
We found that lane changes could provide indiscernible x-
acceleration if the user made the change slowly, so we ig-
nored them in favor of turning events, which show forces
of similar magnitude to acceleration or deceleration events.
The same general strategy was used, to pick out left and
right turns, dependent upon positive or negative direction
of force on the x-axis. Finally, any data not involved in
turning events is discarded as it is redundant to the cruising
event data.
6.4.2 Acceleration Events Calculated from GPS Po-
sition Data
To ﬁnd users’ acceleration and velocity from the GPS posi-
tion data, the distance between each point is ﬁrst calculated.
This is an approximation derived from the points’ latitudes
and longitudes. With distance calculated in this manner,
velocity and acceleration are simple time derivatives of the
position data. Acceleration data is only along the y-axis
here as the distance calculation loses any direction data,
and calculating direction for use in turning acceleration is
prohibitive with the infrequency of data collection. Conse-
quently, turning and lane change events are not considered
for GPS data.
Though the overall data is accurate, at times in all users’
data there would be a delay followed by a receipt of an old
data point, now incorrectly timestamped, along with a new
one. Due to the complexity and noteworthy delay involved
with communicating with satellites, this issue would result
in some oscillatory noise. For this reason and the normally
infrequent collection of data, acceleration events are not so
nicely shaped as they are for the data acquired by the ac-
celerometer, so these events are parsed diﬀerently. Here, a
data point is considered part of a positive acceleration or a
deceleration event only if is further than a standard devia-
tion away from the average zero acceleration. This ignores
the tails of acceleration events, which do not usually appear
tapered out in this data. Coasting is again absorbed into de-
celeration events, and as before any remaining points with
nonzero velocity are classiﬁed as cruising events.
7. EVALUATION
7.1 Experiment Framework
We had 31 volunteers participate in this project. These
volunteers represent ages ranging from late teens to early
60s and included students, faculty, oﬃce workers, and self-
employed. They were given our application to run on an
Android device. The application was designed such that
at the beginning of a trip, the user would place the device
in a horizontal position facing forward, and press a button
to start data collection. No further input was required until
reaching the destination, at which point the user would press
a second button to stop data collection. All laws pertaining
to phone usage in vehicles were thereby satisﬁed and driving
safety upheld. These volunteers were tasked with accumu-
lating at least 30 minutes to an hour of driving data, and
some collected up to two hours.
To quantify the accuracy of our system, we examine its
rates of false alarm and mis-detection as we vary the system
parameters. We deﬁne the rate of false alarm as the fraction
of users who are not correctly identiﬁed as themselves. In
this case, the system would render an alarm indicating the
legitimate user is unauthorized. The rate of mis-detection
includes users who are incorrectly identiﬁed as other users.
This case involves no alarm raised over the current driver
being someone other than the owner. These values are our
criteria in the following sections.
7.2 Feature Selection
We are able to extract positive acceleration, deceleration,
and cruising events from both the accelerometer data and
the GPS data, as well as turning events from the accelerom-
eter data. We now show the performance of each of these
431metrics in a comprehensive test of our datasets and decide
whether or not to include them in our feature vectors.
As discussed earlier, we use the K-S test to compare be-
tween two users’ distributions from a particular event and
velocity range. The test measures the distance between the
empirical distribution functions of the two distributions. If
the distances are all small, the null hypothesis that they
are from the same probability distribution is decided to be
correct. If the largest distance is greater than a threshold de-
pendent upon a speciﬁed signiﬁcance level and the size of the
distributions, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating they
are from diﬀerent probability distributions. A smaller signif-
icance level results in a larger threshold value and thereby a
larger tolerance for variation in two distributions ultimately
identiﬁed as belonging to the same distribution. We ﬁnd
that among our useful event types, a signiﬁcance level of
0.005 allowed most users to be identiﬁed as themselves with-
out others also appearing the same. Consequently this value
is used as we exhibit the performance of each event type.
The Total Variation Distance is similar to the K-S test,
but instead of examining the largest distance between two
distributions, it takes a sum of the distances between every
point in the distributions. A smaller total variation distance
can indicate two distributions are similar, while a large dis-
tance can imply diﬀerence. We ﬁnd that the K-S test is
stronger for comparing the shapes of the distributions, while
the total variation distance is stronger in comparing their
overall sizes. The two tests are combined as discussed in
Section 5.2 detailing our testing process, with a series of
thresholds we optimize later in this Evaluation section.
For the following several features, ﬁgures will be shown
to illustrate the performance of each feature in comparing
every driver to every other, for GPS and accelerometer data.
Speciﬁcally, with 31 available datasets, there are 930 trials
which involve attempting to diﬀerentiate one user from an-
other, and 31 trials where each driver should be identiﬁed
as themselves. In the Self bar, the Correct portion shows
the number of users (out of 31) correctly identiﬁed as them-
selves, while the Incorrect portion shows the number of tri-
als where users did not appear like themselves. The Correct
portion of the Other bar shows the number of trials (out of
930) where our tests correctly diﬀerentiate between diﬀer-
ent users, while the Incorrect portion represents users who
appear similar to other users.
In short, the Incorrect component to the Self and Other
bars represent the false alarm and theft mis-detection rates,
respectively. Good features will have few mis-detections and
as few as possible false alarms, so a perfect ﬁgure would show
31 correctly authorized trials and 930 correctly denied trials.
Thresholds vary for each type of data, and are selected to
provide the best results and show the potential eﬃcacy of
the acceleration type and source.
7.2.1 Positive Acceleration
For both the accelerometer and GPS data, positive ac-
celeration events present eﬀective divergence between users.
Figure 5 shows the results. For the GPS, requiring all veloc-
ity ranges to have nearly equivalent distributions properly
identiﬁed all 31 users as themselves, but also allowed users
to impersonate others in 116 of 930 such comparisons. The
accelerometer data allows fewer impersonations, 32 of 930
possible, but fails to identify 17 of 31 users as themselves.

Figure 5: Positive acceleration trial statistics from
GPS (left) and accelerometer (right) datasets
can potentially (and does, as shown later in this section)
produce good results.
The usefulness of these features is logical: a driver’s pre-
ferred positive acceleration is only ever limited with an upper
bound by traﬃc (at stoplights with long lines, for example),
so for most places and times, drivers are able to accelerate
as they please. In the case of traﬃc, the data used in this ex-
periment was amassed in a city consistently named among
the worst cities in the United States for traﬃc, so what-
ever inaccuracy traﬃc can impose is present in our results.
By a lower bound, positive acceleration is never limited ex-
cept in the cases of risky merging or exceptionally impatient
followers. The latter case is an out-lier, and the former in-
corporates an individual’s particular acceptance of risk into
the data which can increase rather than limit the accuracy
in discerning between users.
7.2.2 Negative Acceleration
As seen in Figure 6, deceleration events from the GPS data
prove roughly as eﬀective as positive acceleration events.
Indeed, 30 of 31 users are correctly self-identiﬁed, and 124
of 930 possible impersonations are allowed using only this
data. In contrast, the accelerometer data does not function
well for this feature, with 176 impersonations and only half
of the possible self-identiﬁcations.

Figure 6: Negative acceleration trial statistics from
GPS (left) and accelerometer (right) datasets
432It does make sense that deceleration might be less useful
than acceleration events. Negative acceleration events have
more potential limitations on driver freedom and variation,
as they are more a function of necessity than positive accel-
eration events. Other drivers’ behavior can induce braking,
by merging or pulling out in front of the subject, or in traﬃc
by simply being numerous. Stoplights can change unexpect-
edly, causing attenuated available stopping time such that
drivers have to brake diﬀerently than they would otherwise.
The diﬀerence in eﬃcacy between the two sources is at-
tributed to the more coarse-grained GPS data failing to cap-
ture brief rapid braking events caused by reactions to the
environment instead of driver preference. The accelerome-
ter includes these un-useful reactions along with the useful
information on driver preference, and suﬀers accordingly.
7.2.3 Cruising
Figure 7 shows the poor results of identiﬁcation using
cruising data. While only one false alarm occurred with the
GPS data, 198 trials allowed impersonation to take place.
Accelerometer data was considerably worse, with 324 im-
personations and just a little more than half of the users
correctly self-identiﬁed. This is rather unsurprising, because
cruise time depends almost entirely on the driving locale.
Also, variation in speed while maintaining a mostly constant
cruising speed can depend on the car’s cruise control system
and changes in terrain as much as it might depend on a user
manually maintaining speed with measurable ﬂuctuation.

7.2.5 Velocity Range Partitioning
Finally, Figure 9 illustrates the beneﬁts aﬀorded by split-
ting the training and testing datasets by the velocity of each
data point. At left is the best result obtainable without
the use of speed ranges, while the right chart shows the
better result from their use. While the mis-detection rate
holds static, the false alarm rate collapses from six to one,
providing more conﬁdence in our system’s ability to cor-
rectly identify users as themselves. This equates to 97%
self-identiﬁcation and 91% diﬀerentiation rate.
