### Explanation:
- **Clarity and Coherence:** The original text was clear, but I added a colon after "ATT&CK ID" and "ATT&CK Technique Name" to make it more structured.
- **Professionalism:** I bolded the ATT&CK ID and the CVE number to highlight these important identifiers, which is a common practice in technical documentation.
- **Consistency:** I ensured that the reference (e.g., [83]) is properly placed at the end of the sentence.
