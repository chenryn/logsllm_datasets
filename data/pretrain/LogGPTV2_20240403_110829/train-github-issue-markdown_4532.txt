It would be really nice if we could show the name of the shell in the tab
title instead of the full path to it. It would make the tab titles shorter,
and allow for easier visual recognition of which tabs are what. Ideally, if
there is more than one tab with the same name it should append "-1", "-2",
etc. to the tab name.
