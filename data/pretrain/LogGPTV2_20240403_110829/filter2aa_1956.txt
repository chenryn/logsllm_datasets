Who We Are
•  360 Technology is a leading Internet security company in China. Our 
core products are anti-virus security software for PC and cellphones. 
•  UnicornTeam (https://unicorn.360.com/) was built in 2014. This is a 
group that focuses on the security issues in many kinds of wireless 
telecommunication systems.  
•  Highlighted works of UnicornTeam include: 
•  Low-cost GPS spoofing research (DEFCON 23) 
•  LTE redirection attack (DEFCON 24) 
•  Attack on power line communication (BlackHat USA 2016)
Voice Solutions in LTE Network
•  VoLTE 
•  Voice over LTE, based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
•  Final target of network evolution 
•  CSFB 
•  Circuit Switched Fallback: switch from 4G to 3G or 2G when taking voice call 
•  SV-LTE 
•  Simultaneous Voice and LTE 
•  Higher price and rapid power consumption on terminal 
Occasional Discovery
•  When we used OsmocomBB as cellphone to access GSM
 network, we met a difficultyDuring debugging the
 problem, we occasionally found a fake paging response
 can build the connection to network
Normal 2G Call vs. CSFB
When we analyze the 
signaling flow of CSFB, 
we were surprised to 
find that there is no 
authentication step.
In normal 2G call, 
AKA does exist for 
every call.

Vulnerability in CSFB
•  The principle is like someone comes out from the door of LTE, then enters the door of 
GSM. He shouts ‘I must be as quick as possible!’ Then he is permitted to enter, without 
the badge of GSM.
How can we exploit it?
•  Basic idea 
•  Because CSFB hasn’t authentication procedure, attackers can 
send Paging Response on 2G network, impersonating the victim, 
then hijack the call link.  
Experiment Environment
C118 
OsmocomBB L1
OsmocomBB L2/3

Exploitation I – Random Hijack
The first idea we got, is to 
randomly attack the 
cellphones in CSFB status.  
Attack Steps
•  1) Listen on PCH channel 
•  2) Extract TMSI/IMSI in paging 
•  3) Forging a paging response with the 
TMSI/IMSI 
•  4) Check whether MSC accepts the 
paging response 
Why Network Sends Paging on 2G
•  Cellphone stays in 4G 
•  Network sends paging message in 4G LTE PCH. But this paging message 
uses 4G’s S-TMSI, not 2G’s TMSI.  
•  S-TMSI and TMSI are generated during combined attach or location 
update procedure.  
•  C118 really hear paging messages 
•  In some cases, network sends paging message both on 4G and 2G.  
•  So using the TMSI captured on 2G can response the CSFB call on 4G.  
•  Usually the network sends TMSIs, but sometimes it sends IMSI.
Hijack Result
•  C118 has no SIM card. 
•  C118 successfully hijacked one call from 139920. 
Attack Signaling Flow
The Ghost Telephonist 
gets control from here.  
What can attacker do in further?
•  If attacker answers the incoming call 
•  The caller will recognize the callee’s voice is abnormal.  
•  What does attacker know now 
•  Victim’s TMSI or IMSI 
•  Caller’s phone number 
•  What can attacker do in further?
Exploitation II – Get Victim’s Phone Number
•  During an ongoing call, 
sending ‘CM Service 
Request’ does not trigger 
authentication, and the 
network will directly response 
a ‘CM Service Accept’. 
•  So attacker can make a call 
to another in-hand phone to 
know the victim’s ISDN 
number.
Attack Signaling Flow
•  1) Send ‘hold’ 
•  ) Send ‘CM Service 
Request’ 
PCAP Records
Here are the records captured 
by Wireshark on the laptop that 
Osmocom is running on.  
It confirmed that attackers can 
build a MO call connection with 
the network.
Targeted Persistent Attack
•  Former discussion is about randomly attack. Here we introduce targeted 
persistent attack to hijack the victim’s link. 
•  Use TMSI 
•  Once attacker knows one TMSI, he can persistently send Paging Response with this 
TMSI, no matter whether there is paging coming. 
•  Use IMSI 
•  If attacker knows one victim’s IMSI and know where he is, the attacker can go to the 
same paging area, and continuously send paging response with the IMSI to hijack 
the victim’s link.  
•  Use ISDN number 
•  If the attacker knows victim’s phone number the attacker can firstly call the victim 
then capture the TMSI of the victim. After that use TMSI to launch the attack. 
Targeted Persistent Attack – Use TMSI
•  Condition 
•  Attacker knows victim’s TMSI 
•  Attack Steps 
•  ) Persistently sending Paging Response with this TMSI 
•  2) Once victim has a Paging procedure existing, attacker can 
quickly control the link. 
Targeted Persistent Attack – Use IMSI
•  Condition 
•  Attacker knows victim’s IMSI 
•  Attack Steps 
•  1) Persistently sending Paging Response with this IMSI 
•  2) Once victim has a Paging procedure existing, attacker can control the link. 
•  Disadvantage 
•  When network side receives Paging Response with IMSI, it has to find out the 
corresponding TMSI, so this method will increase the link building latency then 
consequently results in low ratio of successful attack. 
Targeted Persistent Attack – Use phone number
•  Condition 
•  Attacker knows victim’s ISDN number  
•  Attack Steps 
•  1) Make a call to victim with an 
anonymous cellphone, to trigger a 
CSFB; Use one C118 to sniff TMSI  
•  2) Use another C118 to continuously 
send Paging Response with the TMSI 
and use anonymous cellphone to make 
second call to trigger CSFB again.  
•  ) Hijack and hold the victim’s link.

Advanced Exploitation – Attack Internet Account
•  Login with verification SMS  
•  Some applications permits login with cellphone number + verification SMS. Don’t 
require inputting password.  
•  Reset login password with verification SMS 
•  A lot of Internet application accounts use verification SMS to reset the login 
password. Attacker can use the cellphone number to start a password reset 
procedure then hijack the verification SMS.  
Advanced Exploitation – Attack Internet Account
Advanced Exploitation – Attack Internet Account
•  C118 Log shows it received 
the SMS sent from Facebook 
to the victim 
Advanced Exploitation – Attack Internet Account
•  We investigated the password reset routine of many popular 
websites and applications, including global and Chinese ones, for 
example SNS website, payment website, and IM App etc. 
•  Telephonist and the victim should be in the same paging area (several 
base stations’ coverage) 
•  The attack is feasible only when 2G network is in use and uses A5/1 
or A5/0 encryption. 
Constraints
•  Telephonist attack doesn’t need to access SS7 
core network.  
•  Telephonist attack doesn’t need fake base 
station.  
•  The victim keeps online in 4G network and is not 
aware of the attack.  
Different Behaviors from Different Terminals
•  Different behaviors 
•  We found some cellphones are easily hijacked but some are not.  
Cellphones with [] have 
better defense against 
this attack. Jamming is 
needed to cut off the 
connection between 
victim cellphones and the 
network. 
Failure Analysis
•  What ‘successful hijack’ means 
•  After the attacker sends Paging Response, he receives the call. This 
means a successful hijack. 
•  Whether can hold the link 
•  When the attacker receives the call, the call may be interrupted after a 
short time.   
•  The reason is: the victim cellphone didn’t receive the call and it wants to 
‘Fast Return’ back to 4G, so it will launch a Location Area Update 
procedure in 2G. This LAU results in the break of attacker’s link.  
Fast Return Case 1 – Mi4C Cellphone, Qualcomm Chipset
Paging Response failure
Location Update not completed
Fast Return Case – Qiku Cellphone, MTK Chipset
Paging Response failure
Location Update completed
Jamming on the Victim
•  Break victim’s LAU 
•  If the attacker sends jamming signal to the victim, this will break the 
link between victim and network, so that the attacker can keep 
holding the fake link.  
•  This will increase the success ratio of the attack.  
•  Disadvantage is the victim may sense the attack.  
Countermeasures
•  To operators 
•  Improve the CSFB authentication procedure. The additional latency 
is acceptable. 
•  Speed up VoLTE service deployment 
•  To Internet service provider 
•  Be careful that the PSTN authentication is not safe. NIST guidance 
suggests not to use PSTN in two-factor authentication.  
•  The password reset procedure should be improved by additional 
personal information check.  
GSMA CVD Program
•  What’s CVD Program? 
•  CVD Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Programme 
•  ‘Disclosures to GSMA must focus on open standards based 
technologies which are not proprietary to a specific vendor but that 
are used across, or have significant impact on, the mobile industry 
(e.g. including but not limited to protocols specified by IETF, ITU, 
ISO, ETSI, 3GPP, GSMA etc.)’ 
Good platform for reporting standard based vulnerability.
GSMA CVD Program
•  UnicornTeam received the FIRST 
acknowledgement on the Mobile 
Security Research Hall of Fame. 
•  GSMA transferred the vulnerability 
information to every operators.  
•  Now related operators are fixing or 
already fixed this vulnerability.
