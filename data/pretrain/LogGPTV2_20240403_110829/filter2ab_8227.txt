### Title: Breaking Secure Bootloaders: US-21

**Abstract:**
Bootloaders in modern devices often employ signature verification mechanisms to prevent the execution of malicious software. This presentation aims to highlight actionable weaknesses in contemporary bootloaders that can be exploited to deploy unsigned code, despite these security measures.

**Outline:**

**Phase 1: Exploiting Bootloaders in Android Smartphones**
- **Introduction to Bootloader Security:**
  - Overview of bootloader functions and their role in device security.
  - Explanation of signature verification mechanisms used by bootloaders.
- **Exploitation Techniques:**
  - Bypassing bootloader unlocking restrictions.
  - Decryption of protected user data.
  - Deployment of malicious software on devices with full disk encryption.
- **Case Studies:**
  - Detailed examples of vulnerabilities in popular Android smartphone models.
  - Demonstration of how these vulnerabilities can be exploited.

**Phase 2: Exploiting Secondary Hardware Bootloaders**
- **Introduction to Secondary Hardware:**
  - Overview of secondary hardware components in smartphones, such as embedded RF chips.
  - Importance of secure firmware update protocols in these components.
- **Reverse Engineering Techniques:**
  - Methodologies for reverse engineering firmware update protocols.
  - Identification of weaknesses in signature verification mechanisms.
- **Exploitation of Firmware Update Protocols:**
  - Demonstration of deploying custom firmware to an embedded RF chip.
  - Discussion of the potential impact and mitigation strategies.

**Conclusion:**
- Summary of key findings and their implications for device security.
