User: I want to have my application read a document using xml.sax.parse. Things work fine but when I move the executable to a Windows server 2008 machine things break down. I get an SAXReaderNotAvailable exception with "No parsers found" message.
The setup I'm using to build the executable is:

64 bit windows 7
Python 2.7.2 32-bit
PyInstaller 1.5.1
Assistant: The executable turned out to be fine. For some reason or the other there's wrong versions of the needed dlls in PATH and the executable ended up trying to use those.
