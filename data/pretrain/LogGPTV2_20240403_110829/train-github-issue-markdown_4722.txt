This works fine in Chrome React DevTools, only an issue in the Firefox flavor.
React version: N/A
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Use the React DevTools in Firefox
  2. With the Components inspector open, press e.g. CMD-+ or CMD-- to increase/decrease the UI font size
## The current behavior
The rest of the debugger UI reacts (heh) to the change in font size, but the
React DevTools font remains tiny. This is a critical accessibility issue -- I
have a visual disability and this makes the DevTools extremely hard to use.

## The expected behavior
The React DevTools UI also changes font size.
