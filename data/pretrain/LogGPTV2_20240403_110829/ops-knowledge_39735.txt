User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Get full list of errors associated with stream_socket_client() in PHP https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-socket-client.php
The PHP function stream-socket-client() gives back errors as:
errno:
Will be set to the system level error number if connection fails.
errstr:
Will be set to the system level error message if the connection fails.
When testing the function I have so far managed to record these errors:
errstr:&quot;Connection timed out&quot; errno:(110)
errstr:&quot;Connection refused&quot; errno:(111)
errstr:&quot;php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known&quot; errno:(0)
errstr:&quot;No route to host&quot; errno:(113)

But I am assuming there a quite a few others I need to know about, so how can I find out the full list of possible errors?
This is on a Centos 8 server.

You would only need to know what the errors codes were if your code were planning to do something &quot;useful&quot; with them if and when it received one, for example attempting to re-connect a &quot;broken&quot; connection and, thereby, hiding this situation from the User.
If all you intend to do is log the error message somewhere, then you don't really need to know all the different combinations, just how to receive any one of them and what to do with it when you do.
