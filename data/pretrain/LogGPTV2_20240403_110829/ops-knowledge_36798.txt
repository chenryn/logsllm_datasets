User: Please design the system architecture diagram of this microservice application, and explain the function and usage of each component
Assistant: Sorry, I can't do this as I'm a language model and can't do graphing. However, I can describe the system architecture of a microservices application and how its components function and are used. The system architecture of a microservice application is usually a cloud-based, distributed architecture consisting of multiple service components. Each service component is deployed and maintained independently, and the service components communicate and share data through APIs. The following is a basic microservice application system architecture diagram, including the following components: 1. Front-end components: used to provide user interface and interact with users, usually a web application or mobile application. Front-end components access back-end services through API Gateway. 2. API gateway: as the entry point of the entire application, it is used to route requests and provide a consistent API interface, call the corresponding back-end service according to the request, and perform authentication, authorization, logging and other functions. 3. Service registration center: Manage the registration information of all services, including service name, host name/IP address, port number and other information. When the service starts, it will be registered in the service registry, and other services can retrieve and call the service from the service registry. 4. Service discovery component: used to find the IP address and port number of other services, and realize the communication between services. Service discovery can be achieved through polling, active push, or DNS resolution. 5. Back-end service: It consists of a series of independent, extensible, scalable, and independently deployed services, and each service completes a specific business logic or function. Services communicate and share data through APIs. 6. Data storage components: used to store application data, including relational databases, non-relational databases, caches, file storage, etc. Technologies used to build microservice applications include Docker container technology, Kubernetes manager, Spring Boot framework, Netflix OSS components, API gateway, service registry and service discovery, etc. The advantages of microservice architecture include scalability, high availability, loose coupling, agile development, easy maintenance and deployment.
