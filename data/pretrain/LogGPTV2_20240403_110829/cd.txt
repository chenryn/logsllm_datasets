Remarks
If command extensions are enabled, the following conditions apply to the cd command:
The current directory string is converted to use the same case as the names on the disk. For example, cd c:\temp would set the current directory to C:\Temp if that is the case on the disk.
cd c:\temp
Spaces aren't treated as delimiters, so  can contain spaces without enclosing quotation marks. For example:
cd username\programs\start menu
is the same as:
cd "username\programs\start menu"
If extensions are disabled, the quotation marks are required.
To disable command extensions, type:
cmd /e:off
Examples
To return to the root directory, the top of the directory hierarchy for a drive:

To change the default directory on a drive that is different from the one you are on:
cd [:[]]
To verify the change to the directory, type:
cd [:]
