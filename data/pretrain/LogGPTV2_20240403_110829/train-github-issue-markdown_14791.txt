### Issue Report

#### I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
The page should render correctly.

## Current Behavior
The page is not rendering. Instead, it displays the following error:
```
The default export is not a React Component in page: "/"
```

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Update to Next.js 5.0.0 using the command from the blog:
   ```sh
   npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
   ```
2. Reduce the page to the following code, which still results in the error:
   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   export class MyComp extends React.Component {
     render() {
       return (
         <div>Hello World</div>
       );
     }
   }

   export default MyComp;
   ```

## Context
This issue occurs after updating to the latest versions of Next.js, React, and React DOM. The page was previously working without any issues.
