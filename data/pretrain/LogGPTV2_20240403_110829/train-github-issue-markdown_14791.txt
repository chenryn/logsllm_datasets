## Expected Behavior
Page should render
## Current Behavior
Page is not rendering. Instead giving error that ` The default export is not a
React Component in page: "/"`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Update to Next 5 using command from blog: `npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest`
I reduced my page to this, and still got error:
    export class MyComp extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
              Hello World
        )
      }
    }
    export default MyComp;
