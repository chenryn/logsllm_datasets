Question: An Android application developer is optimizing the app's security and performance for a release build. They need to configure ProGuard or R8 to obfuscate the code. Which of the following statements correctly describe the actions the developer should take and the trade-offs involved?
"A": "The developer should use R8 because it can obfuscate the code without removing useful attributes for debugging such as line numbers, source file names, and variable names.",
"B": "To prevent runtime errors, the developer must keep certain classes using the `-keep` flag in the `proguard-rules.pro` file, especially for common Android classes such as Activities, Applications, and Services.",
"C": "Applying obfuscation to the entire codebase is recommended to achieve the highest level of security, even if it comes at the cost of significant runtime performance degradation.",
"D": "The developer should avoid using any code shrinking or obfuscation techniques since they always result in a considerable decrease in runtime performance, outweighing any security benefits."
Answer: B
