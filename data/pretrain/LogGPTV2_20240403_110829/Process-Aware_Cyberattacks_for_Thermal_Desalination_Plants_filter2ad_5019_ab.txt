To the best of our knowledge, no research work has specifically
targeted Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) desalination plants and analyzed
the impact of cyberattacks on performance and mechanical com-
ponents. Table 1 summarizes the basic differences between these
critical infrastructures with regards to their components, attacks
proposed, and their impacts.
3 MSF DESALINATION PROCESS: A PRIMER
Desalination is the process of converting high salinity sea water
into potable water. Desalination technologies can be mainly divided
into thermal (boiling sea water, collecting steam and leaving behind
salt), crystallization (utilizing electric current to drive ions across a
selectively permeable membrane separating water and salt), and
membrane methods (using pressure to drive sea water through
selectively permeable membrane leaving behind salt). Our focus
is on Multi-Stage Flash desalination technique, falling under the
thermal category, as this has been the most employed technique
in the past and older desalination plants still use MSF as their
technique for desalination. Some recent plants have started using
membrane methods, but we target existing, legacy infrastructure
built in an era when cybersecurity was not a priority. Still, most of
the attacks described here also apply to other types of desalination
plants such as Multi Effect Distillation, Thermal Vapor Compression
and Mechanical Vapor Compression.
MSF desalination plants mainly consist of three sections, as
shown in Fig. 1: (a) Heat Rejection Section, (b) Heat Recovery Sec-
tion, and (c) Heating Section. Temperature of the seawater increases
as it flows through the heat rejection section. It absorbs latent heat
of condensation from the vapors of feed brine flowing inside the
flashing chambers. Some of this heated seawater is then mixed
with the feed brine while a part of it is rejected as cooling seawater.
This process allows for a safe mixing of this new intake with the
feed brine in the last stage. To control the maximum salinity inside
flashing chambers, some part of this brine mixture is rejected as
blow-down brine. High salinity reduces the amount of heat that
can be absorbed by the brine which further reduces efficiency of
the plant.
Mixture of this new brine, dubbed “recycle brine” is then sent to
heat recovery section. As recycle brine flows through the condenser,
it absorbs latent heat of condensation. These vapors are released by
the feed brine flowing inside the flashing chambers and condense
on the tube of the condenser. These flashed off vapors (distillate)
pass through the demister and are then collected in a distillate tray.
The flashing process takes place due to the decrease in the stage
saturation temperature which reduces the corresponding stage
pressure. After this, recycle brine enters heating section where it is
heated using steam and then passes into flashing chambers as feed
brine. Due to the use of recycle brine as feed brine, the amount of
steam required to heat it to the top brine temperature is reduced.
This recycle brine already absorbs heat released by the vapors while
flowing through the heat recovery section [2].
4 THREAT MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
In this study, we use a Matlab Simulink model for simulating the op-
eration of a MSF desalination plant ported from [10]. We investigate
attack outcomes assuming 3 types of attacks:
(1) Sensor Attacks: In this scenario, adversary manipulates
readings of the sensors, some of which are input to the con-
trollers. This is a typical example of False Data Injection. The
model has 4 flow rate, 3 level, 3 temperature, and 1 pressure
sensors.
(2) Actuator Attacks: Adversary manipulates the signals to
the valves of the plant. It should be noted that in our model
all the actuators are valves. The model has 2 gas valves and
9 liquid valves.

(3) Controller Attacks: Here, the adversary can modify the
control parameters of the process. The model includes PI
controllers which are control loop feedback mechanism used
to get optimum response based on the values of P (Propor-
tional) and I (Integral) parameters. The adversary can modify
the P, I, and setpoint (desired output) of the controllers.
We assume that the adversary has compromised the ICS network
inside MSF desalination plant and has access to the Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Some of the tech-
niques that can be used by the adversary to gain access into the
network are mentioned below [30]:
(1) Using an infected device infiltrated inside the trusted perime-
ter as a source of entry point. For instance, an employee can
be given an infected USB memory stick by using social engi-
neering skills.
(2) By exploiting poorly configured firewall, weak passwords
that are used to access VPN or spear email phishing for
targeting victims into providing their passwords.
(3) In case of a compromised supply chain, preinstalling mali-
cious codes and backdoors into devices that are supplied to
the plant can provide direct access to the adversary. Using

that it caused the centrifuge to rotate at a higher speed for a fixed
time and then it was again brought down to a normal value while
sending recorded values to the monitoring system. This decreased
the performance of the plant in the long term and also had eventual
mechanical impact on the affected centrifuges.
5.1 Performance Attacks
The main objective of the adversary is to incur financial loss to
the desalination plant while remaining within operational limits.
For a desalination plant, distillate product is the critical output.
Therefore, reducing the amount of distillate will cause financial
loss to the company. There are four important performance criteria
that are used for describing a desalination plant:
5.1.1 Thermal Performance Ratio. Thermal Performance Ratio (TPR)
is defined as the ratio of the amount of distillate produced to the
amount of steam supplied. A high TPR value means that more
amount of distillate is produced per unit amount of steam supplied
to brine heater. So, for decreasing the performance of the plant,
the attacker has to decrease TPR such that the amount of distillate
decreases per unit amount of steam supplied to the brine heater.
For decreasing TPR, the adversary can decrease the amount
of steam supplied to brine heater or manipulate the setpoints of
the controllers, in order to reduce the amount of steam flowing
into the brine heater. Another approach would be to only change
the P or I value of PI controller. Moreover, the adversary can also
decrease the final stage brine level by increasing blowdown flow
rate which reduces the overall feed brine flowing inside the flashing
chambers. The attacker can also inject false sensor data and deceive
PI controller into decreasing the amount of steam flow allowed into
brine heater.
Specific Feed Flow Rate. The Specific Feed Flow (SFF) rate
5.1.2
is defined as the ratio of feed sea water to the amount of distillate
produced. The value of this performance parameter should be low,
indicating that the amount of feed seawater input to the system is
less than the amount of distillate produced.
The attacker can try to increase this parameter such that the
plant does not operate at an optimum state. Increase in SFF implies
that there is an increase in the amount of feed sea water required
to produce unit amount of distillate.
Specific Cooling Water Rate. The Specific Cooling Water
5.1.3
(SCW) rate is defined as the ratio of the amount of cooling seawater
used per unit amount of distillate produced. This efficiency parame-
ter should be low because the amount of distillate produced should
be more than the amount of sea water required.
An actuator attack can increase the SCW parameter while also
decreasing the corresponding distillate output.
Salinity Ratio. Salinity Ratio (SR) is defined as the ratio of
5.1.4
top brine salinity to the salinity of intake seawater. This parame-
ter should also be minimized, as an increase in the salinity ratio
corresponds to an increase in the top brine salinity which reduces
performance of the plant. Moreover, high salinity can increase the
occurrence of localized corrosion, decrease in the flow rate of the
brine and eventual blockage in the pipes.

these compromised devices, malicious code can be spread
across other devices on the network.
After internal network infiltration, the adversary has access to
the PLCs that receive remote commands from SCADA system. This
access can be used to manipulate P and I term values of the PI
controller. A PI controller is a control loop feedback mechanism
which is used to get optimum response based on the values of P
and I parameters. Moreover, the adversary can also read values of
the sensors that are connected to Data Acquisition Server (DAQ)
and SCADA system. These values can be recorded during normal
operation and then replayed for deceiving the monitoring module of
SCADA system, similar to how Stuxnet was reporting appropriate
values to the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of the operators.
Therefore, according to our simulation model, the adversary has
access to 11 sensors, 3 controllers, and 11 actuators, as shown in
Fig. 2 and Table 2 labels all the components in the simulation.
It should be emphasized that exploring new attack entry points,
payload delivery, etc. are outside of the scope of this work. A wealth
of attack vectors have been reported, such as social engineering,
USB infiltration, spear email phishing, etc. It is also assumed that the
adversary can read values of the sensors that are connected to the
SCADA system. The contribution of this work lies on performing
process-aware cyber threat analysis.
5 PROCESS-AWARE CYBERATTACKS
Process-aware cyberattacks [22] intelligently modify sensor or ac-
tuator signals, or the dynamic process being controlled and the
implementation mechanism of the control algorithm. The attacks
can be broadly categorized in two categories (Fig. 3): 1) Perfor-
mance Attacks, which aim to stealthily incur financial damage to
the plant operation, and 2) Mechanical Failure Attacks, which aim
to physically destroy equipment.
This section introduces process-aware cyberattacks which are
simulated in Section 6. The adversary needs to deceive the mon-
itoring module of SCADA system by recording legitimate values
