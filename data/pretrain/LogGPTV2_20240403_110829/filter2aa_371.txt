LTE/5G Big MAC Layers!
Terminology Quick Start:
UE (User Equipment) 
•
Phone, Tablet, Laptop, Things with SIM!
eNodeB / gNodeB 
•
Cell Tower for LTE/5G
•
No one knows what happened to fNodeB!
• So, I like using fNodeB to refer to both LTE & 5G cells!!

• A SPARROW UE can send successive 40-bits messages
• Successive RACH attempts do not impact other users much.
• Picking low backoff time: like every 40 ms => 1 kbps tput.
• This vulnerability can be traced back to LTE Rel. 8 and still 
exists in 5G-NR.
• Although less-relevant FR2 (above 6 GHz) due to beamforming 
it can be easily exploited in LTE lower-bands and FR1 to 
achieve around 5 miles range.
• Higher ranges achievable in upcoming 5G-NTN (satellite 
gNBs).

GENERAL REMEDIATION
24
A wireless MAC layer protocol is deemed vulnerable
to SPARROW technique, if any of its procedures allows 
forming two sets of uplink messages (M) and the downlink 
broadcast messages (B) satisfying all the following conditions:
1) Passive Reception: any signal in (B) are anonymously 
decodable.
2) Bijectivity: one-to-one correlation between (M) & (B).
3) Anonymous Uplink: no need to attach to the network.
4) Stateless Uplink: Trudy can successively send any 
message from (M) without protocol violation.

Understanding CRI Purpose
Msg1: RA-RNTI = 1, RAPID = 8
Msg2: eNB sends RAR scheduled w/ RA-RNTI = 0, 
and provides TC-RNTI = x , TA, and UL grant for Msg3
Msg3 (RRC-Conn-Req): 
UE1 sends 48-bit MAC CRI
Msg4 (RRC-Conn-Setup): eNB send contention 
resolution response including the UE1 MAC CRI
Msg1: RA-RNTI = 1, RAPID = 8
Msg3 (RRC-Conn-Req): 
UE2 sends 48-bit MAC CRI
Wrong TA!
•
The value is arbitrary by UE 
•
Think of it as a ping-pong or selective 
ack
•
Rebroadcast in Msg4 is universally 
decodable (QPSK) by both UE and 
non-UE devices 
•
UE identities remain hidden
26
• No preset CRI for privacy
• No Shared secret UE & fNB
• Salt must be sent to UE
• Ricky can still map (B) to (M) 
by computing hash (rainbow)
• fNB cannot distinguish 
between Trudy and other 
users so cannot risk blocking

• Utilize lateral thinking and your peers!
• There’s a nice sweet spot between building your own wireless 
protocol or piggy backing on top of the application layer for 
hidden communication. Just because it’s layer 2 doesn’t mean 
it’s a short distance.
• We don’t think LTE and 5G are the only radio accessible 
systems with this kind of problem. Start researching other MAC 
layer negotiation protocols, notably for wireless systems, like 
satellites.
• LTE and 5G is for everyone now - CBRS
