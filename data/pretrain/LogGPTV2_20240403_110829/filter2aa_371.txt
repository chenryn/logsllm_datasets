## Motivation

### Background
- **Past Experience:** Extensive research in wireless security.
- **Previous Work:** Collaborated with US operators before joining Keysight in 2018.
- **Research Focus:** Investigated lesser-known data exfiltration techniques at ATI.
- **Inspirational Factors:**
  - The opportunity to work with advanced Base-Station emulator equipment for open-field research.
  - The satellite talk at DEF CON 28, "Whispers Among the Stars: Perpetrating (and Preventing) Satellite Eavesdropping Attacks" by James Pavur.

### Key Drivers
- **Covert Communication:** Recognized as a potential threat.
- **Hacker Mentality:** Exploit software vulnerabilities.
  - Tunneling via various protocols such as ICMP, DNS, etc.
  - Challenged by security systems like IPS, IDS, and LI.
- **Engineer Mentality:** Build hardware solutions.
  - Developed L1 radios using spread spectrum and ham radio technologies.
  - Addressed issues like signal blocking and avoiding spectrum monitoring.

### Conceptualization
- **Exploiting MAC Standard Weaknesses:** In cellular and satellite communications.
- **Radio Height Advantage:** RF signals are difficult to stop.
- **Scenario:** Trudy bounces a broadcast signal from any powerful Wireless Access Node to Ricky.

## Exploiting LTE & 5G Standard Weaknesses

### Understanding the MAC Layer
- **Definition:** The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer in the OSI model.
- **LTE/5G Terminology:**
  - **UE (User Equipment):** Devices like phones, tablets, and laptops with SIM cards.
  - **eNodeB/gNodeB:** Cell towers for LTE and 5G, respectively. The term fNodeB is used to refer to both.

### Normal RA Procedure
- **Msg1:** UE starts Random Access (RA).
- **Msg2:** eNB sends Random Access Response (RAR) with RA-RNTI, TC-RNTI, Timing Advance (TA), and UL grant for Msg3.
- **Msg3:** UE sends RRC Connection Request with a 48-bit MAC CRI.
- **Msg4:** eNB rebroadcasts the MAC CRI to acknowledge Msg3.
- **Msg5:** UE starts the NAS process.

### Exploiting CRI Broadcast
- **Msg1:** UE starts RA with RA-RNTI = 1, RAPID = 8.
- **Msg2:** eNB sends RAR with RA-RNTI = 1, TC-RNTI = x, TA, and UL grant for Msg3.
- **Sniffing PDCCH:** For RAR with DCI-1C, RA-RNTI = 1, RAPID = 8.
- **Sniffing PDCCH:** For DCI-1 with TC-RNTI = x.
- **Msg3:** Encoded 48-bit MAC CRI.
- **Msg4:** Rebroadcasts MAC CRI.
- **Decoding MAC CRI:** Ricky decodes the MAC CRI.

### Successive Attempts
- **SPARROW UE:** Can send successive 40-bit messages.
- **Impact on Other Users:** Minimal.
- **Backoff Time:** Every 40 ms, achieving 1 kbps throughput.
- **Vulnerability:** Exists since LTE Rel. 8 and persists in 5G-NR.
- **Range:** Achievable up to 5 miles in LTE lower-bands and FR1.
- **Future Potential:** Higher ranges in 5G-NTN (satellite gNBs).

## Why SPARROW?

- **No Network or Spectrum Footprint**
- **Low Hardware Complexity**
- **Efficient Power Usage**
- **Unstoppable**

## Demo & Use Cases

### Testbed Setup
- **Equipment:** Keysight UXM, Test PC, PRT Script.

### Application Scenarios
- **Data Exfiltration:** Extract sensitive data from secure locations.
- **Supply Chain:** Remote access embedded in modem firmware.
- **Command & Control (CnC):** Trigger or monitor events remotely.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cellular infrastructure operational without backhaul links.
- **Failover Broadcast:** Alternative for emergency notifications.
- **Extended Network:** Lightweight IoT network using someone else’s fNodeB.
- **Pager Network:** Localized medium-distance pager network.

### Geographical Enhancements
- **Reliability and Rate Enhancement:** Via parallel Point-to-Point (PTP) links.
- **Range Increase:** By relay nodes in overlap areas.

## General Remediation

### Vulnerability Model
- **Conditions for Vulnerability:**
  1. **Passive Reception:** Any signal in (B) is anonymously decodable.
  2. **Bijectivity:** One-to-one correlation between (M) and (B).
  3. **Anonymous Uplink:** No need to attach to the network.
  4. **Stateless Uplink:** Trudy can successively send any message from (M) without protocol violation.

### Understanding CRI Purpose
- **Msg1:** RA-RNTI = 1, RAPID = 8.
- **Msg2:** eNB sends RAR with RA-RNTI = 0, provides TC-RNTI = x, TA, and UL grant for Msg3.
- **Msg3:** UE1 sends 48-bit MAC CRI.
- **Msg4:** eNB sends contention resolution response including UE1 MAC CRI.
- **Msg1:** RA-RNTI = 1, RAPID = 8.
- **Msg3:** UE2 sends 48-bit MAC CRI.
- **Wrong TA!**
  - **Value Arbitrary:** Set by UE.
  - **Ping-Pong Mechanism:** Selective acknowledgment.
  - **Rebroadcast in Msg4:** Universally decodable by both UE and non-UE devices.
  - **Privacy:** UE identities remain hidden.

### Solutions That Don’t Work
- **No Preset CRI for Privacy**
- **No Shared Secret Between UE and fNB**
- **Salt Must Be Sent to UE**
- **Ricky Can Map (B) to (M) Using Hash (Rainbow)**
- **fNB Cannot Distinguish Trudy from Other Users**

### Solution That Works: ELISHA
- **Extensible Loss-Induced Security Hashing Algorithm (ELISHA):**
  - New salting to reduce short-string hash collisions.
  - Infeasible to construct rainbow tables or forward-error correction code books.
  - Potential applications beyond secure RACH.
