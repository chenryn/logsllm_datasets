User: I have a Python daemon running on a Linux system.
I would like to feed information such as "Bob", "Alice", etc. and have the daemon print "Hello Bob." and "Hello Alice" to a file.
This has to be asynchronous. The Python daemon has to wait for information and print it whenever it receives something.
What would be the best way to achieve this?
I was thinking about a named pipe or the Queue library but there could be better solutions.
Assistant: There are several options
1) If the daemon should accept messages from other systems, make the daemon an RPC server - Use xmlrpc/jsonrpc.
2) If it is all local, you can use either TCP sockets or Named PIPEs.
3) If there will be a huge set of clients connecting concurrently, you can use select.epoll.
