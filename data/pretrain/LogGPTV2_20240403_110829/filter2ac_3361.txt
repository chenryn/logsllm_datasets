### Title: Black Hat US-20: Heroku Abuse Operations - Hunting Wolves in Sheep's Clothing

**Abstract:**

While Black Hat attendees are well-versed in security, the strategic importance of abuse management is often overlooked. At its core, abuse operations focus on detecting and responding to malicious activity, even when systems are functioning as intended. Traditional security practices emphasize prevention, governance, and compliance, whereas abuse operations address a broader spectrum of misuse, abuse, malice, and crime.

At any given moment, numerous actors are bypassing detection and response systems, masquerading as legitimate customers to exploit your systems and services. Unlike full compromise scenarios, abuse is a slow-burning issue where customers can become the problem, and it can quickly escalate into a significant threat.

In this session, we will provide an insider's view of active abuse on one of the largest pure-play, remote-code-execution-as-a-service (RCE-aaS) platforms: Heroku. Allan and Spencer will guide you through the cat-and-mouse game of identifying and mitigating ever-evolving malicious behavior hidden among legitimate users. They will also share how to transform low-value indicators into high-value decisions and demonstrate the benefits of "pushing left" to make the platform less hospitable for abuse.

For those dealing with abuse, this session will initiate discussions on how to tackle abuse at scale and provide practical scaffolding that you can implement immediately upon returning to work.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Understand the role of abuse operations in the broader context of security.
- Learn from real-world examples of abuse on the Heroku platform.
- Discover methods to detect and respond to evolving abusive behavior.
- Gain insights into transforming low-value indicators into actionable decisions.
- Explore strategies to make your platform less attractive to abusers.

This session is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively manage and mitigate abuse, ensuring the integrity and security of your systems and services.
