titleblackhat:us-20 Heroku Abuse Operations: Hunting Wolves in Sheep&#39;s Clothing
Black Hat attendees 'get' security - but strategically speaking, where does abuse management fit?Abuse Operations - at its core - is detection of and response to malicious activity when everything is working "as designed." Classical security is interested in prevention, governance, and compliance, while abuse operations looks at the wider picture of misuse, abuse, malice and crime. At any moment in time, multiple actors are bypassing detection and response systems masquerading as customers in order to take unfair advantage of your systems and services. Different from the full compromise scenarios we know and love, abuse is a slow simmering burn, where our customers can become a problem, and worse, your problem. Attendees in this session will get an insider's view into active abuse on one of the largest pure-play, remote-code-execution-as-as service (RCE-aaS) platforms on the Internet: Heroku.Allan and Spencer walk through the cat-and-mouse hunt for ever-evolving miscreant behavior hidden in the sea of legitimate users, build mechanisms to turn low value indicators into high value decisions, and show the value of "pushing left" to make the platform less hospitable for abuse.For attendees dealing with abuse - this session will start conversations on how we engage abuse at scale - and the scaffolding you can apply on Monday when you get back to work.
