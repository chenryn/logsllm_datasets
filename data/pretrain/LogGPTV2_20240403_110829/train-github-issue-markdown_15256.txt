There one features that lacks most of 3rd party virtual desktop is to have
independent virtual desktop that can be freeze any time.
For example, I will have a few virtual desktop with everything set (app
already opened and placed where I want to) for :
  * my work 1 (for example : dev in HTML4)
  * my work 2 (for example: dev in python)
  * my home (everything related to games & leisure)
  * my personal dev (my own website and its tools)  
etc...
Whenever I need to switch to another desktop, I won't loose all opened windows
etc.
PS: I don't even know if something like is possible through powertoys.
Perhaps, it's OS dependant...
