User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Synchronise client to internet time server from within a domain Our infrastructure team have bigger things to worry about right now than the network time being 2 minutes out (2 mins slower than external reliable sources). However, the time being wrong really bugs me and the more anal retentive members of our department. 

Can we fix this? Yes we can!
I know we can because I've done it before. My machine currently synchronizes to "time.nist.gov", i think. At least that is the value in the registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\W32Time. What I know for sure is that it is within a second of several reliable time servers. My colleagues machines match the network. 

After I last rebuilt my machine (approx a year ago) I made some changes to get the time synching correctly but can't for the life of me remember how!

I know this is pretty similar to this question, however I have a slightly different angle on it. Maybe a little reverse engineering of the syncing machine will help us?

Background:
I (and my anal-retentive colleagues) are all members of the Domain Admins group and have local admin right to our boxes
We cannot change the Domain or DCs in any way. 
We each have unrestricted access to the internet. 

So far tried:
Cloning the registry HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\W32Time to the other machines - this failed

Assistant: Do this and you WILL have trouble.  Active Directory requires all machines on the domain to be time synced within a certain tolerance for correct functionality, so if the difference becomes too large you may find yourself not being able to log on.

If it really bothers you that much you should talk to your admins about syncing their PDC emulator with a more reliable time source, and explain to them that the time difference is causing you issues (be prepared to have to back it up with a credible case though).

If you insist on keeping your own machine to a separate time source, you can expect your admins - when they become aware of it - to refuse to provide support to you until you put it back the way it should be.  You may even have a GPO that is enforcing the correct domain hierarchy time setup, thus preventing you from messing with it.

The moral of this story is "don't interfere with the way things are supposed to work".
