After #6990 is merged, we should rephrase the installation docs in terms of
pip install on linux. Basically if you're on i386 or x86_64 you can now use
binaries. If you're on raspberry pi, or some other ARM or whatever, the
warning still applies. So I think it's fair to now recommend pip install
sklearn as the main methods of installation, and add a warning that on non-
intel linux that is a bad idea.
