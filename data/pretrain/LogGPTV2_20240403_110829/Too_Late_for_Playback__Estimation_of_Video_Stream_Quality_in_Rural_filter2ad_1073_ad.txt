the application and network layers. [15,26,33,40,44,45] require direct access to
(encrypted or unencrypted) network traﬃc to infer video QoE. In contrast, our
approach is independent of network traces and incorporates low-cost signal and
throughput measurements for rapid QoE prediction. Few publicly available QoS
datasets include synchronous RSRP measurements. [17,48,63] analyze network
traces that contain performance indicators captured during streaming sessions,
and experiment metadata from mobile broadband networks. All of these datasets,
however, have limited types of datapoints (primarily from dense, urban loca-
tions); the datasets have minimal to no measurements from networks that are

under-provisioned or located in remote regions. We believe it is challenging to uti-
lize existing prior datasets (from primarily urban scenarios) to evaluate diverse
network conditions in the context of the measurements examined in this work,
either due to non-overlapping and non-scalable nature of prior measurements
or lack of a comprehensive and representative dataset. Further, the accuracy of
our models, given the inexpensive measurements, indicates the feasibility and
scalability of our approach.
Prior work that has focused on charting the relationship between RSRP and
QoE has important limitations. For instance, [10] presents a mapping of RSRP
and video QoE that is derived using only simulated experiments. The authors
of [47] explore the eﬀect of radio link quality, such as RSRP, on streaming video
QoE. The presented results are limited in scope as their setup streams a custom
video hosted on their own server; by omitting evaluation of a popular streaming
service, such as YouTube or Netﬂix, the work does not accurately capture the
application and network performance experienced by actual users. [9] undertakes
a study similar to ours, however, with a modest dataset that is limited to a small
portion of a local transit route and is thus diﬃcult to generalize.
5 Conclusion
Through an extensive measurement campaign, we collect 16 datasets with widely
varying performance proﬁles. Our dataset includes representation of: i) the vari-
ability of mobile broadband performance as a consequence of either sparse deploy-
ments or network congestion, and ii) the communities most likely to be dependent
on mobile broadband (rural areas). Through our analysis, we highlight the chal-
lenges of quantifying QoE metrics at scale, particularly in remote locations. To
address this challenge, we develop learning models that use low-cost and easily
accessible QoS data (LTE-speciﬁc RSRP and throughput) to predict QoE metrics.
Our models can be generalized to video content from diﬀerent genres, as well as to
other locations that share network characteristics similar to those of our dataset.
The observed eﬃcacy of the models indicates that video QoE can be more easily
and scalably determined within diﬃcult to assess regions, using low-cost QoS mea-
surements. For instance, given the increased load on video streaming platforms
during COVID-19 [50], cellular operators could employ our approach to detect
sectors with possible bottlenecks without having to rely on user feedback/com-
plaints, particularly in remote locations. This has the potential to lead to faster
turnaround times for network troubleshooting [55], and therefore may lower out-
age periods for users heavily dependent on video streaming.
