User: I'm looking for an embedded scripting language.
I don't need anything fancy, just basic constructs like conditionals, loops, logic and arithmetic operations etc. 
I have the following requirements

Thread friendly - i.e. without "global interpreter lock" (python is out for this reason)
Cheap "interpreter instance" creation - I will have potentially 100s of these. I understand that lua creates a separate gc thread per every Lua_State which means lua is out.
No gc or refcounting or any other "on the fly" memory management. It should simply destroy any variables once the script is executed. Again both python and lua are out.
And of course it should be fast and have low memory footprint.
Should work on windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X

Any help is highly appreciated.
Assistant: Reconsider Lua:

Yes.
Yes. Lua does not create any OS threads at all.
Garbage collection does not start until you've created lots of objects. You can simply turn it off. To destroy all variables once the script is executed, simply close the state.
Yes.
Yes.
