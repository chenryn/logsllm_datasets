**Title: Botconf2017: Combining Math, GPU, and DNS for Real-Time Detection of Locky DGA Seeds**

We have developed and implemented a sublinear hash-collision method on a GPU to identify dynamic Locky DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) seeds in real-time DNS query traffic. By integrating this fast search method with real-time DNS traffic analysis, we can detect all dynamic Locky DGA seeds within seconds of their first appearance. This allows us to predict and generate all future C&C (Command and Control) domain names from these seeds.

These predicted C&C domain names are then distributed to production systems used by ISPs worldwide, where they are blocked. Additionally, the identified domain names are shared with DGArchive and the broader security community, enhancing collaborative efforts in combating malware.
