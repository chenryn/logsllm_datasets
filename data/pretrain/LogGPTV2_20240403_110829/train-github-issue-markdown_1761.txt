**Issue with `crypto/rand` Package Example**

When running the last example from the [Go `crypto/rand` package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/), I encountered an error. The `Read` function is printing the following error message:

```
error: read /dev/urandom: Invalid argument
```

I have reviewed the example code, and it appears to be correct. However, I do not frequently work with this package, so I might be missing something.

Here is a screenshot of the error:

If you have any insights or suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Sarah
