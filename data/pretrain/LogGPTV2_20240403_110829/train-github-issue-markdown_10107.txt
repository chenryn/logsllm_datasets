  * Electron version: 0.36.10
  * Operating system: Windows 8.1 64bit
Hello ! I have just created a simple window which loads an url.
The problem is that while visiting the URL in chrome or any other browser,
everything is fine, but when opening it in Electron, it says jQuery is not
defined.
The problem comes from here:
Returning `Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined`.  
if I would set a timeout, everything works. But, wasn't that supposed to
happen when `async` tag is set to true ?
This behaviour looks pretty much like `async="true"` on script tags.  
I have also tried setting that `async` tag to `false` but still, same
behaviour.
I decided not to use a local `index.html` file that would contain a `webview`
because of the white background that appears, and then, the `did-finish-
loading` which gets triggered when the local page loads but not the webview (
which is to be expected )
Therefore I am running the app like the following
`window.loadURL('https://tribul.net')`;
Is it an expected behaviour ?
