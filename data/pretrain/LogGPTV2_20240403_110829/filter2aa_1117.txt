Why members?
 Why responsibility? Why democracy?
 If you want to get heard:
• Get out of the closet
• Say and prove there is someone you represent
 Members give not only credibility, viability 
and financial resources but in addition, 
active members contribute to statements 
etc. much like in open source development

Fight against EUCD
 European Union Copyright Directive, EUCD 
== DMCA, only worse
 EU member countries have to change the 
national laws to reflect directives
 First Finnish law proposal was awful -> EFFI 
(and others) managed to block it in the 
parliament after successful hearings
 Parliament ran out of time, which helped a lot 
(otherwise they might have tried to correct 
the law)

..but the fight goes on
 The latest version came out 7/16/03
 This time it will be accepted, the 
question is if EFFI can change it at all
 EU-wide cooperation to find innovative 
ways to “circumvent” the directive

“The Freedom of Expression in Public 
Communication Act” == Censorship Act  
 Local censorship law proposal to all ”web 
publications” from 2001
 Original version would have set severe 
restrictions and criminal punishments 
including:
• Archive all publications for 3 months 
• All web-publications must have 18-year-old 
editior-in-chief (including usenet and IRC etc..)
• Log practically all Internet traffic
 No clear definition what is a web publication

Censorship Act … cntd
 EFFI joined the forces with local ISPs
 EFFI was invited to testify in the 
Constitutional Committee
• Clear technical and economic arguments 
why the current proposal is obtuse
 Most of the proposed changes were 
accepted in early 2003

European-wide activity
 Lots of push to found ”EFF-Europe”
• Too many voices around to have one vision
• Too little resources to do something EU-wide (it’s 
bloody expensive to lobby in Brussels)
 In effect, the most ambitious groups founded 
European Digital Rights, EDRI in 2002
 Lobbying against software patents
• Euro-Linux Alliance

What are we doing?
 EFFI is a ”human change agent”
• We aim at changing the perception of 
general public and politicians 
 Because they do not know
• Politicians get their information from daily 
news and friends; just guess who have 
feeded those sources for ages…
• Also plain tech-ignorance is still 
commonplace among elder politicians

“So, what can I do?”
 Easy way: give money to others to do the 
work
 Hard way: become activist
• Unorganized activism
• Organized activism
 It can be fun (and if your are lucky you don’t 
even have to pay to get to Defcon)
Both important

Effective Activism
 It’s too expensive to buy publicity, 
therefore:
• Learn how to write press releases 
• Learn how to arrange pickets
• Civil disobedience?
 GreenPeace style
 Anti-globalization movement style
Electronic Frontier Finland ry 
http://www.effi.org/
Learn how to read laws
 Yes, really. And it’s not even that 
difficult
 Anyone how can read Perl can learn to 
decipher legalese..
 Code has bugs, laws have loopholes 
• Legal exploits

Found your own association?
 First, check if there is any decent 
activity already happening in your area
 If not or there is some problem like an 
inefficient organization or too many 
control-freaks around:
• Start online discussion groups, invite 
people by email, and if everyone agrees, 
go and do the real thing
Electronic Frontier Finland ry 
http://www.effi.org/
Our experience says…
 Get individual members and give them 
possibility to contribute; ally with other 
organization locally and internationally
 Give press releases and circulate them 
to every relevant newspaper, radio and 
TV channel; speak roughly and straight
 Call policy makers and arrange 
meetings; try to behave elegantly
