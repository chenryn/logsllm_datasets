Question: Consider a scenario where an application requires the transmission of small amounts of data with minimal overhead and latency. Which of the following characteristics of the UDP protocol are advantageous and which could be potentially disadvantageous for this application?
"A": "UDP's lack of guaranteed delivery might lead to data loss, which is disadvantageous for applications that require reliable communication.",
"B": "The use of checksums in UDP headers to detect corrupted packets is advantageous as it provides a basic level of integrity checking.",
"C": "UDPâ€™s support for discrete packet handling can be advantageous for reducing the overhead and improving the speed of data transmission.",
"D": "The potential for datagrams to be larger than the network's packet size introduces fragmentation issues, which is disadvantageous."
Answer: ABCD
