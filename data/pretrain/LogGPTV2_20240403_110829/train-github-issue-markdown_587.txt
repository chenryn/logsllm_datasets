env: macOS  
tf version: master brunch
I built tensorflow on `macOS` using `build_all_ios.sh`. Then I tried to load
`frozen.pb` data created by python program. Here is a code to load graph in
`iOS`:
        Status status;
        Session *session;
        status = NewSession(SessionOptions(), &session);
        if (!status.ok()) {
            return NO;
        }
        GraphDef graph;
        NSString *modelPath = [[NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]] pathForResource:@"frozen" ofType:@"pb"];
        status = ReadBinaryProto(Env::Default(), modelPath.fileSystemRepresentation, &graph);
        if (!status.ok()) {
            return NO;
        }
        status = session->Create(graph);
        if (!status.ok()) {
            std::cout 
    	 [[Node: GatherNd = GatherNd[Tindices=DT_INT32, Tparams=DT_FLOAT](GRU-RNN/rnn/transpose, stack)]]
I think this is because python script contains `tf.gather_nd` function. I
found that `tf_op_files.txt` does not contain any `gather*` functions, so I
tried to add them manually but I don't know that exactly should I add and
where. Can you please provide some information about that and probably add
some issues about `Less` and `Add` operations for `Int32` type?
