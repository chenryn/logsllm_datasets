All transitions (hide/show modals, navbar, tooltip, tabsâ€¦) are ended by
emulateTransitionEnd and the maximum duration of each transition is hard-coded
that way (350ms, 150ms). That makes it impossible to customize css-transitions
to take longer. Please enable us to set our own transition durations.
