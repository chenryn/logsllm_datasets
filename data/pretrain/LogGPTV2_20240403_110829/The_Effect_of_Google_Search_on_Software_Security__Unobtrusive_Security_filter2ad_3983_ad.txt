### Results for 𝑡10

The results in 𝑡10 were found to be insecure. For the KEY, we observed slightly different outcomes due to the selection of 𝑏𝑠. This selection prioritizes a higher probability of secure best-practice results, ensuring that insecure results have a lower probability overall. This decision influenced the distributions for KEY.

- **Boosted Secure Best-Practice Results (𝐵(10, 0.047))**: As shown in Figure 4 (KEY, 𝑡10, green), the probability of at least one secure result is 33.14%, two results is 8.99%, and three results is 1.4%.
- **Boosted Secure Results (𝐵(10, 0.094))**: Shown in Figure 4 (KEY, 𝑡10, blue), the probability of at least one secure result is 37.47%, two results is 22.52%, and three results is 7.95%. The distribution of boosted secure results increased compared to non-boosted secure results in Figure 2.
- **Boosted Insecure Results (𝐵(10, 0.007))**: Shown in Figure 4 (KEY, 𝑡10, red), the probability of at least one insecure result decreased from 37.35% to 9.32%, and for two results, it decreased from 15.22% to 0%. There is a 95.22% chance that none of the results are insecure, compared to 43% for non-boosted secure results.

### CIPHER Results

For CIPHER, the distribution of boosted secure results (𝐵(10, 0.062)) over 𝑡10, as shown in Figure 4 (CIPHER, 𝑡10, blue), is slightly higher than for IV and slightly lower than for KEY. The probability of at least one secure result increased from 21.06% to 36.76%, two results from 2.71% to 12.64%, and three results from 0.24% to 2.19%, compared to non-boosted secure results in Figure 2. The probability of any insecure result is 0%, which was 37.77% before, and the probability of no insecure results increased from 44.41% to 100%.

### Summary

We demonstrated that the new distributions of boosted results show the required relative probabilities. Secure best-practice results have the highest distribution, followed by secure results, with very low probabilities for insecure results. However, for KEY, secure best-practice results have a lower distribution than secure results due to the trade-off ensuring that insecure results have the lowest probabilities.

### Clustering and Boosting

Clustering of secure best-practice results and boosting helps in performing security-based re-ranking. We then tested whether the original ranking by 𝑐𝑠𝑒 and the re-ranked results by 𝑐𝑠𝑒𝑏 had an effect on code security. Specifically, we examined if developers solving programming tasks with Google Search would produce different results in terms of code security when using 𝑐𝑠𝑒 versus 𝑐𝑠𝑒𝑏.

### Study Setup

We used the Developer Observatory framework [43] for the study, which provides study templates, an online code editor, tracking functions, and security features. Participants were presented with a landing page, followed by a consent form and an explanation of the online code editor and Jupyter notebook. The notebook introduced the tasks and provided code skeletons. Each task could be run and solved independently, and a code cell was provided to test the solutions. The notebook used a Java 8 kernel.

Participants were instructed to solve each task using the provided Google Search bar. They were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (using 𝑐𝑠𝑒𝑏) or the control group (using 𝑐𝑠𝑒). The search bar was opened in a new browser tab.

### Study Results

#### Interaction Plots

Figures 6a and 6b show interaction plots for security and functional correctness. These plots indicate the relationship between the number of searches and condition (control vs. treatment).

- **Security (Figure 6a)**: A higher number of searches had a different effect on security for each condition. In the control group, the mean of secure solutions remained around 1.6. In the treatment group, the mean of security increased from 1.6 to 1.9 for search counts above the median. This indicates a statistically significant positive interaction effect.
- **Functional Correctness (Figure 6b)**: The amount of searches did not affect the control group, with the mean of functional solutions remaining around 2.5. In the treatment group, the mean of functionality increased from 2.35 to 2.58 for search counts above the median. This also shows a statistically significant positive interaction effect.

#### Logistic Regression Models

We provide logistic regression models to show the statistical significance of these key results.

- **Model MS1**: No Searches Performed had no significant effect on security.
- **Model MS2**: Secure ∪ Best-Practice Results had a significant positive effect on all participants (𝑝 < 0.05).
- **Model MS4**: The interaction variable Condition × Searches confirmed that in the treatment group, increasing searches had a significant positive effect on security (𝑝 < 0.05).

Figure 7 further illustrates that the treatment group received more secure (45.8% vs. 30.8%) and secure best-practice results (36.9% vs. 0.4%) than the control group.
