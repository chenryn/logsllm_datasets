User: I have a python file and I am running the file.  
If Windows is shutdown and booted up again, how I can run that file every time Windows starts?
Assistant: Above mentioned all the methods did not worked I tried them all , I will tell you more simpler solution and alternative of windows task scheduler
Create a .bat file with content 
"ADDRESS OF YOUR PROJECT INTERPRETER" "ADDRESS OF YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT WITH SCRIPT NAME"
Store this bat file into the window startup folder(by default hidden)
FYI: to find window startup folder 
press windos+r then 
type shell:startup -- it will directly take you to the startup folder
copy the bat file there with following 2 address in the same format ,
then simply restart the system or shut down and boot up.
The code will automatically run within 20 seconds of opening.
Thank me later
