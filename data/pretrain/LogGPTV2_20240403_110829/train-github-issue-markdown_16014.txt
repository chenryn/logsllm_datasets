  * Electron Version: 2.0.2
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): macOS 10.13.4
  * Last known working Electron version: 1.7.12
This has been noticed when trying to upgrade VS Code to Electron 2.0.2 in
microsoft/vscode#52196
**Expected Behavior**  
Characters with opacity in a monospace font should be rendered without
duplication (in the next whitespace).
**Actual behavior**  
Characters with opacity in a monospace font are rendered doubled when followed
by whitespace.
**To Reproduce**  
Using https://github.com/electron/fiddle , here is the HTML code needed to
reproduce in the renderer:
        Hello World!
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    const
    &nbsp;
    a
    &nbsp;
    =
    &nbsp;
    `hdshhdasha;
        Hello World!
        We are using Node.js ,
        Chromium ,
        and Electron .
The above should render the text:
        const a = `hdshhdasha;
**Screenshots**
Notice how `a` and `=` are doubled:

**Additional Information**  
This does not reproduce when running with `--disable-gpu`.  
This does not reproduce when removing the opacity.  
This does not reproduce when using two `&nbsp;`s in a ``.  
This does not reproduce on Chrome 67.  
This does not reproduce on all macOS machines we have tried, but it reproduces
on some Windows machines.
