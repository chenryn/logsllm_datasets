When rendering:
    render: function() {
        {this.state.value}
    }
Output:
    Hello World
There is only a text node as a child of this span, no react components and yet
I still receive the
"A component is `contentEditable` and contains `children` managed by React. It
is now your responsibility to guarantee that none of those nodes are
unexpectedly modified or duplicated. This is probably not intentional."
Is this expected?
