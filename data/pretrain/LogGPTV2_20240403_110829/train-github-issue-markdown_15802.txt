When rendering the following code:

```javascript
render: function() {
    return <span contentEditable={true}>{this.state.value}</span>;
}
```

with `this.state.value` set to `"Hello World"`, I encounter the following warning:

> "A component is `contentEditable` and contains `children` managed by React. It is now your responsibility to guarantee that none of those nodes are unexpectedly modified or duplicated. This is probably not intentional."

The output is a `<span>` element with the text "Hello World" as its only child, and no other React components are involved. Is this warning expected in this scenario?
