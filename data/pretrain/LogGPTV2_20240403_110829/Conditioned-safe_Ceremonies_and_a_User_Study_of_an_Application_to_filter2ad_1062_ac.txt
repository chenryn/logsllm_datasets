### 1. Mitigating Demand Characteristics and Perceived Authority
To ensure the validity of our study, we addressed several potential issues:
- **Demand Characteristics:** We minimized the likelihood that participants would guess the true purpose of the study and alter their behavior. 
- **Perceived Authority:** We reduced the influence of perceived authority figures during the study.
- **Appropriate Physical Location:** We selected a setting that minimized any unrealistic influences on participants.

### 2. Study Design
Our study addressed these issues in two key ways:
1. **Non-Laboratory Setting:** We conducted the study remotely, avoiding a laboratory environment.
2. **Deception:** We used deception to conceal the true purpose of the study. Participants were informed that the experiment aimed to determine how well individuals could predict high-grossing movies.

#### Recruitment and Consent
- **Recruitment:** We recruited participants remotely through the Experimental Social Science Laboratory (Xlab) at UC Berkeley.
- **Consent Process:** During the consent process, participants were told that they would log into our website over a seven-day period and predict the top three highest-grossing movies each day. They were compensated with $20 as base pay and up to an additional $3 per prediction based on accuracy. The maximum total compensation was $41.

#### User Interface and Risk Simulation
- **User Interface:** Participants logged in from their own computers at any time and place. A screenshot of the interface is shown in Figure 1.
- **Risk Simulation:** To create a sense of risk, we provided password-protected accounts and simulated the experience of "banking" earned money. Participants were paid via PayPal at the end of the study.

### 3. Simulated Attacks
After participants made five predictions, we simulated a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) social engineering attack. After the attack, we debriefed participants about the true purpose of the study and requested their reconsent for data use.

### 4. Recruitment Details
- **Recruitment Method:** We recruited 225 users from the Xlab in April 2008. The user pool was primarily composed of university students and staff.
- **Eligibility:** Only native English speakers were included, with approximately 1950 eligible users.
- **Group Assignment:** 208 users signed up and were assigned to one of five groups using round-robin allocation. One group used challenge questions, while the other four used different variants of email registration links.

### 5. Registration Procedures
- **Account Creation:** Each participant created an account with a username and password, and provided their email and PayPal email addresses.
- **Computer Registration:** Participants had to register their computer before accessing their account. For the challenge question group, they set up and confirmed their challenge questions. For the email registration groups, they received a registration email and clicked a secure link to register their computer.

### 6. Simulated Attack Methods
- **Challenge Questions (Group 1):** The attack page mimicked the legitimate challenge question page but removed warnings and informative text.
- **Email Groups (Groups 2-5):** We simulated copy and paste and forwarding attacks. These pages instructed participants to either copy and paste the registration link or forward the registration email to a similar domain name.

### 7. Warnings and Attack Success Metrics
- **Warnings:** Some groups received warnings about safe security practices in their registration emails.
- **Success Metrics:** For Group 1, answering challenge questions correctly on the attack page indicated success. For Groups 2-5, clicking the registration link first indicated failure, while forwarding the email or submitting the link first indicated success.

### 8. Debriefing and Exit Survey
- **Debriefing:** After the study, participants were debriefed about the true purpose and reasons for deception.
- **Exit Survey:** The survey collected demographic information, general computing background, and specific experiences during the study.

### 9. Ethics
- **Ethical Considerations:** Our simulated attacks were ethical, with minimal risk to participants. The study protocol was approved by UC Berkeley’s Institutional Review Board.
- **Privacy Protection:** All connections to our website used SSL, and we implemented measures to ensure the integrity of the simulation.

### 10. Study Results
- **Demographics:** 56% of participants were female, 41% were male, and 3% did not respond. Most participants were young (18-25 years old) and undergraduate students.
- **Attack Success Rates:** The attack succeeded against 92.7% of challenge question users and 41.5% of email users, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test).
