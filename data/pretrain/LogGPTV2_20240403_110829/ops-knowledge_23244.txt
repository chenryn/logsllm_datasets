Question: "You are tasked with selecting a mechanism for generating encryption keys in a new software product that requires cryptographic security. Which of the following methods would be considered secure and appropriate, keeping in mind the need for unpredictability and high entropy?"
 "A": "Sampling data from a CPU's thermal noise patterns."
 "B": "Using a deterministic algorithm that produces bits computationally indistinguishable from true random bits."
 "C": "Generating keys based on the sequence of predictable time intervals, such as minutes of the day."
 "D": "Utilizing a biased physical process, such as a loaded dice that favors certain outcomes."
Answer: AB
