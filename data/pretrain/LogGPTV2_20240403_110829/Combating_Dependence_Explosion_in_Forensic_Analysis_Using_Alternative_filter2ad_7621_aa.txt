### Abstract
Advanced and Persistent Threats (APTs) are increasingly targeting large enterprises, often remaining undetected for months. A common forensic approach involves starting with suspicious events from system logs and performing dependence analysis to trace the attacker's actions. However, this method suffers from the "dependence explosion" problem, where a large number of benign events are incorrectly flagged as part of the attack. In this paper, we introduce two novel techniques, tag attenuation and tag decay, to mitigate this issue. These techniques leverage typical behaviors of benign processes while providing a conservative treatment for suspicious ones. Our system, MORSE, constructs a compact scenario graph that summarizes attacker activity by filtering through millions of system events in seconds. Experimental evaluations using data from government-agency-sponsored red team exercises demonstrate that our techniques effectively identify stealthy attacks, reduce false alarm rates by over an order of magnitude, and generate compact scenario graphs that capture most of the attack while excluding benign background activity.

### Introduction
Recent years have seen a surge in targeted high-profile cyber-attacks on large enterprises, such as Target, Equifax, Deloitte, and the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These sophisticated campaigns, known as Advanced and Persistent Threats (APTs), are carried out by skilled adversaries and can remain undetected for extended periods. For example, the OPM breach lasted over 8 months, compromising sensitive information of 21.5 million individuals, while the Equifax breach went undetected for 2.5 months, exposing social security numbers of over 140 million users.

Unlike traditional malware, APTs deliberately target high-value data and use advanced techniques to bypass existing defenses. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), such as IBM QRadar, are often the first to flag signs of these attacks. However, current IDS face significant challenges:

- **Needle-in-a-haystack**: Many Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) can be triggered by benign activities, leading to a flood of false positives.
- **Connecting the dots**: Existing systems struggle to provide a comprehensive view of the attack, making it difficult to understand the overall campaign.
- **Scaling and performance**: Large enterprises generate vast amounts of audit and security event logs, making graph searches computationally expensive.

### Provenance-Based Detection and Forensics
Researchers have proposed using provenance to address these challenges. Provenance provides additional context to filter out false positives and helps distinguish between benign behavior and attacks. For instance, Backtracker uses coarse-grained provenance from system-call logs to construct a dependence graph, allowing backward and forward analyses to trace the attacker's steps.

### Dependence Explosion
Most forensic techniques rely on coarse-grained provenance, which can lead to dependence explosion. This occurs when every output of a process is treated as dependent on every earlier input operation, especially in long-running processes like web browsers and network servers. This results in a graph with millions of nodes, making it impractical for analysts to interpret.

### Fine-Grained Provenance
Fine-grained information flow tracking can trace specific output bytes to specific input bytes, avoiding the precision loss of coarse-grained methods. However, it incurs high performance overhead and requires extensive instrumentation, making it impractical for most enterprises.

### Previous Mitigation Techniques and Limitations
Researchers have developed alternative techniques to mitigate dependence explosion, but they have limitations. SLEUTH prunes higher-cost paths, but it can still produce graphs with numerous benign nodes. HOLMES exploits the multi-stage structure of APTs, but struggles with attacks lacking this structure. PRIOTRACKER and NODOZE prioritize anomalous dependencies, but require representative training data and assume that attacker activities will be anomalous, which is not always the case.

### Proposed Approach
We propose a new approach that avoids optimistic assumptions about malware behavior, does not require training data, significantly reduces dependence explosion, and yields compact scenario graphs. Our system, MORSE, uses two key concepts: tag attenuation and tag decay.

- **Tag Attenuation**: Captures the idea that objects serve as imperfect intermediaries for propagating malicious behavior. It attenuates data tags before propagating them to written objects.
- **Tag Decay**: Captures the intuition that a benign subject, if subverted, will do so soon after consuming suspicious input. Data tags of benign subjects gradually decay over time unless they exhibit suspicious behavior.

### Implementation and Evaluation
We implemented our approach in MORSE and evaluated it using data from government-agency-sponsored red team exercises. Our evaluation shows that MORSE effectively detects a range of stealthy APT-style campaigns, including those relying on stolen credentials, in-memory malware, and preexisting malware. Our techniques reduced false positives by an order of magnitude and decreased scenario graph sizes by 35x without missing any significant attacker activity.

### Motivating Attack Scenario
To illustrate the problem of dependence explosion, we consider a ransomware attack from a recent red team engagement. The attack involved stolen credentials, malware disguised as a benign application (ccleaner), and extensive interaction with benign background activity. Figure 1 shows a fragment of the dependence graph, highlighting the challenges in detecting and summarizing such stealthy attacks.

### Conclusion
Our work introduces tag attenuation and tag decay to combat dependence explosion in forensic analysis. These techniques, implemented in MORSE, significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of attack detection and forensic analysis, making it easier to identify and respond to sophisticated APTs.
