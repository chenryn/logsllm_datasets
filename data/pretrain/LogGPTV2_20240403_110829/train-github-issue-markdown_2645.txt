**Subject: Request for Assistance with GIF Animation in Glide**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am currently experiencing an issue where the GIF animation loaded using Glide is playing slower than expected. Could you please review the following code and provide any necessary corrections to ensure the GIF plays normally?

```java
RequestOptions options = new RequestOptions();
Glide.with(h.imageView3.getContext())
     .load("https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&quality=80&size=b9999_10000&sec=1508322038285&di=e0c474540228565f1271de3b4b2c56e7&imgtype=0&src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lia-edu.com%2Fupload%2Fimage%2F20170717%2F20170717151619_8233.gif")
     .apply(options.diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.RESOURCE))
     .into(h.imageView3);
```

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

### Suggested Code Adjustments

To ensure the GIF plays smoothly, you might want to consider the following adjustments:

1. **Disable Downsampling**: Ensure that the image is not being downsampled, which can affect the playback speed.
2. **Use `GifDrawable` Options**: You can use specific options for handling GIFs to ensure they play correctly.

Here is the updated code with these considerations:

```java
RequestOptions options = new RequestOptions()
    .diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.RESOURCE)
    .override(Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL, Target.SIZE_ORIGINAL); // Prevent downsampling

Glide.with(h.imageView3.getContext())
     .asGif() // Explicitly load as a GIF
     .load("https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&quality=80&size=b9999_10000&sec=1508322038285&di=e0c474540228565f1271de3b4b2c56e7&imgtype=0&src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lia-edu.com%2Fupload%2Fimage%2F20170717%2F20170717151619_8233.gif")
     .apply(options)
     .into(h.imageView3);
```

This should help in ensuring that the GIF animation plays at its normal speed.
