User: I've been using Python 2.7.10 in a virtualenv environment for a couple of months.
Yesterday, activating the environment went fine, but today suddently I get this cryptic error when trying to start Python from Terminal:
Illegal instruction: 4
I have made no changes to my environment (AFAIK), so I'm having a difficult time trying to come to terms with what this error is and what caused it.
Python works fine outside of this virtualenv environment. When running via /usr/local/bin it presents no problem.
Assistant: I had same problem and found solution by uninstalling psycopg2 and installing older version. As I understood my comp was not supporting some commands in new version
