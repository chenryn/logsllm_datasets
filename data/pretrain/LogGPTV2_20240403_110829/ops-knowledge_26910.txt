User: Please help me to find a way to track lock/unlock time on my WinXP machine. I've tried windows scheduler - it only logs logins, not locks. Any alternatives? 
In Miranda's source code I saw implementation via IdleObject tracker, but this way is too long. May be an AutoIt script? Time tracking program (freeware)?
Assistant: Do check that CanHandleSessionChange property is  True or not ?
This will be checked from the designer view -> Property 
Then use OnSessionChange function
