**User:**
I need a way to track the lock and unlock times on my Windows XP machine. I have tried using the Windows Task Scheduler, but it only logs logins, not lock events. Are there any alternative methods? 

I noticed in Miranda's source code that they use an IdleObject tracker, but this approach seems too complex for my needs. Could an AutoIt script be a viable solution? Or perhaps there is a freeware time tracking program that can handle this?

**Assistant:**
To track lock and unlock events on a Windows XP machine, you can check if the `CanHandleSessionChange` property is set to `True`. This property can be verified in the designer view under the Properties section.

If `CanHandleSessionChange` is set to `True`, you can then use the `OnSessionChange` function to handle and log these events. This method should allow you to capture both lock and unlock events effectively.

Additionally, you might consider using an AutoIt script or a freeware time tracking program. Here are a few options:

1. **AutoIt Script:**
   - You can write a simple AutoIt script to monitor and log lock and unlock events. AutoIt is a powerful scripting language that can interact with the Windows API to detect session changes.
   
2. **Freeware Time Tracking Programs:**
   - **ManicTime:** A popular freeware time tracking tool that can also log when the system is locked and unlocked.
   - **RescueTime:** Another option, though it may require a bit more configuration to specifically track lock/unlock events.

These tools and scripts should provide a more straightforward and efficient way to track the lock and unlock times on your Windows XP machine.
