  * OS Version:
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. edit a file (VSCode marks it as needing to be saved)
  2. Alt+F+S
file doesn't save. in any other windows program, chording Alt+F (let go of F,
keep holding Alt) + S will save the file.
if you let go of "Alt" between F and S, it works. my muscle memory is messing
with me.
