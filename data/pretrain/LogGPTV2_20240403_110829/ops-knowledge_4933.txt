User: I'm trying to do some package manipulation (a la dpkg) and while I can just popen or subprocess.call I'd rather do things the python way if possible.
Unfortunately I've been unable to find a python module to do the trick.
I've seen reference to python-deb but it appears to be defunct. python-apt might seem like a potential solution, but AFAICT it cannot handle individual .deb files. 
Anyone know of a good dpkg python solution?
Assistant: Apparently Gdebi is python based. If gdebi installed you have access to it's functionality via the GDebi module.
I can't seem to find any documentation, so I'm not sure that it's meant to be a public API, but it might do the trick.
