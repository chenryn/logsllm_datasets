User: What are the advantages of Python, PowerShell, and other scripting environments?  We would like to standardize our scripting and are currently using bat and cmd files as the standard.  I think Python would be a better option than these, but am also researching PowerShell and other scripting tools.
The scripts would be used to trigger processes such as wget etc to call web services, or other applications/tools that need to run in a specific order with specific parameters.
We primarily work with the Windows stack, but there is a good chance we will need to support Unix in the future.
Assistant: The questions is kind of vague, but Python is much more portable than PowerShell; however, Python isn't that prevalent on Windows.  But on the other hand, I don't believe PowerShell scripts will work on a Windows machine that doesn't have PowerShell.  Meaning they may not work in the old fashioned cmd shell.  I think you'll find more documentation and libraries for Python as well.
PowerShell is more like Bash than it is a programming language like Python.
Maybe you could explain what you want to do with your scripts and you'll probably get better answers.
