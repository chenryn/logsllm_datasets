I decided to try and run a node project of mine with the following arguments:
    $ deno run --node-modules-dir --allow-env --allow-sys ./src/main.ts --ext ts
It gave back the following error:
    error: Parsing version constraints in the application-level package.json is more strict at the moment.
    Not implemented scheme 'file'
        at file:///{path/to/project}/src/main.ts:42:31
The library it was trying to import at `:42:31` was one with the following
definition in the `package.json`:
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "@my/library": "file:ext/my-library"
      }
    }
This is a relatively straightforward bug, and is pretty low-priority, but
thought I'd write it up as I couldn't find a duplicate.
Thanks for working on Deno!
