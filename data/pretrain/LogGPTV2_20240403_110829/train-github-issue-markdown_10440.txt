In our Continuous Integration (CI) process, we use the following command to build the PowerToys solution:

```shell
msbuild PowerToys.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

This command duplicates some resources used by PT Run and ColorPicker, storing them in the `x64\Release\` directory instead of the more specific `x64\Release\modules\%module_name%\` directory. 

To improve resource management and avoid duplication, it would be better to store these resources in the `x64\Release\modules\%module_name%\` directory.
