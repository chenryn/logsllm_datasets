Question: What are the potential consequences of freeing a pointer that points to memory not allocated with heap allocation functions such as malloc() or calloc()?
"A": "The program's memory management data structures may become corrupted, possibly leading to a program crash or allowing an attacker to modify critical program variables or execute code.",
"B": "The operating system will automatically correct the error and reallocate the memory to prevent any adverse effects.",
"C": "A compiler error will be triggered, preventing the program from compiling whenever free() is used incorrectly.",
"D": "The memory management system will silently ignore the free() call, leaving the program's operation unaffected."
Answer: A
