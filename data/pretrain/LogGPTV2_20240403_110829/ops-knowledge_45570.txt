User: How to set custom expiration time in Redis to control cache expiration and memory usage?
Assistant: Setting a custom expiration time in Redis can be achieved in the following two ways: 1. Use the EXPIRE command to set the expiration time: The EXPIRE command is used to set the expiration time of a key. The syntax is: EXPIRE key seconds, where key is the name of the key whose expiration time needs to be set, and seconds is the expiration time in seconds. For example: ``` redis> SET mykey "Hello" OK redis> EXPIRE mykey 10 (integer) 1 ``` Here, the expiration time of the key mykey is set to 10 seconds. 2. Use the TTL command to get the remaining expiration time: The TTL command is used to get the remaining expiration time of a key. The syntax is: TTL key, where key is the name of the key whose remaining expiration time needs to be obtained. For example: ``` redis> SET mykey "Hello" OK redis> EXPIRE mykey 10 (integer) 1 redis> TTL mykey (integer) 9 ``` Here, the remaining expiration time of the key mykey is obtained is 9 seconds. By setting the expiration time, you can effectively control the expiration and memory usage of the cache in Redis. When a key's expiration time expires, Redis will automatically delete it. This can prevent expired cached data from occupying too much memory resources, and also ensure that the cached data is up-to-date.
