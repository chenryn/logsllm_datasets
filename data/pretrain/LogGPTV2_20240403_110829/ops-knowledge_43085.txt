User: How to scan for system vulnerabilities? Please provide a scanning scheme based on the vulnerability database and network topology, and explain its related indicators and evaluation methods.
Assistant: system vulnerability scanning solution based on the vulnerability library and network topology is as follows: 1. Collect the topology information of the target network, including network devices, IP addresses, network segments, subnets and other information. You can use a network scanning tool (such as Nmap) to scan and organize the results into a network topology map. 2. According to the information in the topology map, determine the hosts and network devices that need to be scanned. You can use vulnerability scanning tools (such as Nessus, OpenVAS) to scan, and select the custom scan option when scanning to ensure that the scan can cover all target hosts and devices. 3. Use the vulnerability library of the vulnerability scanning tool to scan the target host and device for vulnerabilities. The vulnerability library contains known vulnerabilities, exploit tools and script information, which can help users find known vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the target system. 4. Analyze and evaluate the scan results. The scan results include information such as vulnerability level, risk assessment, and suggested repair plan. Based on this information, the risk assessment of the target system can be carried out, and corresponding repair measures can be formulated. The assessment methods are as follows: 1. Vulnerability level assessment. Vulnerability levels are usually divided into five levels from high to low, which are critical, high, medium, low and informational. According to the level of vulnerabilities in the scan results, security risks can be classified. 2. Risk assessment. Analyze the vulnerabilities in the target system based on the scan results, and assess the risks of the target system. According to the importance of the target system, security policy, data sensitivity and other factors, determine the level of security risks and formulate corresponding repair plans. 3. Recommend fixes. According to the repair suggestion provided by the vulnerability scanning tool and the priority of the suggested repair method, the vulnerability in the target system is repaired. It should be noted that system vulnerability scanning can only detect known vulnerabilities and cannot fully guarantee the security of the target system. Therefore, vulnerability scanning is only one aspect of system security testing, and a comprehensive security assessment needs to be combined with other security testing methods.
