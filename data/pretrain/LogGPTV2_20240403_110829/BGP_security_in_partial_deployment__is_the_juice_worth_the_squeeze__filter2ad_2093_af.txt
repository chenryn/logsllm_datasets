once these disruptions are absent (e.g., when most ASes
have transitioned to S*BGP), or to protect speciﬁc, highly-
sensitive IP preﬁxes. Indeed, a survey of 100 network opera-
tors [18] found that 10% would rank security 1st, 20% would
rank security 2nd and 41% would rank security 3rd. (The
remaining operators opted not to answer this question.)
2.3 Mixing the models?
It is important to note that in each of our S*BGP routing
models, the prioritization of the SecP step in the route se-
lection process is consistent across ASes. The alternative—
lack of consensus amongst network operators as to where
to place security in the route selection process—can lead
to more than just confusion; it can result in a number of
undesirable phenomena that we discuss next.
2.3.1 Disagreements can lead to BGP Wedgies.
Figure 1.
Suppose that all ASes in the network, ex-
cept AS 8928, have deployed S*BGP. The Swedish ISP AS
29518 places security below LP in its route selection pro-
cess, while the Norwegian ISP AS 31283 prioritizes security
above all else (including LP). Thus, while AS 29518 prefers
the customer path through AS 31283, AS 31283 prefers the
secure path through its provider AS 29518. The following
undesirable scenario, called a “BGP Wedgie” [23] can occur.
Initially, the network is in an intended stable routing state 2,
in which AS 31283 uses the secure path through its provider
AS 29518 (left). Now suppose the link between AS 31027
and AS 3 fails. Routing now converges to a diﬀerent stable
state, where AS 29518 prefers the customer path through AS
31283 (right). When the link comes back up, BGP does not
revert to the original stable state, and the system is stuck
in an unintended routing outcome.
“BGP Wedgies” [23] cause unpredictable network behavior
that is diﬃcult to debug. (Sami et al. [46] also showed that
the existence of two stable states, as in Figure 1, implies
that persistent routing oscillations are possible.)
2.3.2 Agreements imply convergence.
In Appendix D we prove that when all ASes prioritize
secure routes the same way, convergence to a single stable
state is guaranteed, regardless of which ASes adopt S*BGP:
Theorem 2.1. S*BGP convergence to a unique stable rout-
ing state is guaranteed in all three S*BGP routing models
even under partial S*BGP deployment.
This holds even in the presence of the attack of Section 3.1,
cf., [35]. This suggests a prescriptive guideline for S*BGP
deployment: ASes should all prioritize security in the same
way. (See Section 5.3 for more guidelines.) The reminder of
this paper supposes that ASes follow this guideline.
3. THREAT MODEL
To quantify “security” in each of our three models, we ﬁrst
need to discuss what constitutes a routing attack. We focus
on a future scenario where RPKI and origin authentication
are deployed, and the challenge is engineering global S*BGP
adoption. We therefore disregard attacks that are prevented
by origin authentication, e.g., preﬁx- and subpreﬁx-hijacks [7,
9, 10, 14, 39] (when an attacker originates a preﬁx, or more
speciﬁc subpreﬁx, when not authorized to do so). Instead,
we focus on attacks that are eﬀective even in the presence of
origin authentication, as these are precisely the attacks that
S*BGP is designed to prevent.
Previous studies on S*BGP security [6, 11, 22] focused on
the endgame scenario, where S*BGP is fully deployed, mak-
ing the crucial assumption that any secure AS that learns
an insecure route from one of its neighbors can safely ig-
nore that route. This assumption is invalid in the context
of a partial deployment of S*BGP, where S*BGP coexists
alongside BGP. In this setting, some destinations may only
be reachable via insecure routes. Moreover, even a secure
AS may prefer to use an insecure route for economic or per-
formance reasons (as in our security 2nd or 3rd models).
Therefore, propagating a bogus AS path using legacy inse-
cure BGP [22, 43] (an attack that is eﬀective against fully-
deployed origin authentication) can also work against some
secure ASes when S*BGP is partially deployed.
3.1 The attack.
We focus on the scenario where a single attacker AS m
attacks a single destination AS d; all ASes except m use
the policies in Section 2.2. The attacker m’s objective is
2A routing state, i.e., the route chosen by each AS s ∈
V \{d} to destination d, is stable if any AS s that re-runs its
route selection algorithm does not change its route [24].
