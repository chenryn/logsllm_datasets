What is a “Death Envelope”?
• In today’s high-tech society, far too much
important information is stored purely in
individuals’ brains.
• A record of this information should exist,
in case of one’s incapacitation or
extinction.
• This record must be highly-secured, and
tamper-resistant, and –evident.

How Big a Problem is it?
• High-tech users have lots of passwords.
• First poll I found shows an average of 40
passwords, 15 of which can be
considered “sensitive”.

Who Should Have a Death Envelope?
• In short, anyone with information they wish to
be available after their death.
• An argument could be made that anyone with a
computer will have some reason for a Death
Envelope
• Specifically:
– Those with high-risk jobs or activities.  Police, Fire, Military.
Skydivers, extreme sport enthusiasts.
– Those with high-risk information.  Systems and Network
Administrators, etc.

Who Should Ask for a Death Envelope?
• Managers/employers of Systems and
Network administrators.
– How much downtime is needed if a root
password, or Enterprise Administrator
password is lost?
• The spouses/families of those with high-
risk jobs or hobbies.

Some thoughts on what
should be in your envelope
• Anything stored only in your brain that
people need access to if you’re dead, or
disabled, in a persistent vegetative state,
etc….

Death Envelope vs.
Traditional Aftercare
• Aftercare:  Potentially reference material, lower
risk if invaded
– Bank accounts, real estate information, pension, retirement
funds
• Death Envelope:  You don’t want it referenced

Handwriting vs. Computer
• Handwriting Advantages
– If the Feds can sniff this, you’re truly screwed anyway.
– Easy to create/update anywhere, with the simplest of
tools.
• Computer Advantages
– Consistency
– Variety of very useful fonts

Handwriting Tricks
• Slashed zeroes
• Underline numerics
• Slow down:  shape your letters, don’t
scribble them
• Graph paper, forces one to slow down,
and can indicate spaces in passphrases.

Computer/Font Tricks
• OCR Fonts (Good for humans, too)
OCR A Extended: PASSWORD/p4s5w0rd2z
• Monotype Fonts
Lucida Sans Typewriter

• Most fonts have a slashed zero hidden somewhere.  On
the PC it’s Alt+0216 (large: Ø) or Alt+0248 (small: ø)

Bonus Paper Tricks
• Invisible Inks (UV reactive, chemically reactive,
temperature reactive)
• A signature across the seal point of the
envelope, in water-soluble ink
• For a long-term envelope, consider acid-free
paper, and extremely permanent, tamper-
resistant inks.
– Fisher “Cellulock” Checkguard technology
– Noodler’s “Eternal” Inks.
– … Multiple others?

The Human Factor
• Trust, but with due diligence.
• All parties should understand the importance
• It is 100% appropriate to ask to inspect a
Death Envelope.
• “When to open my envelope” should be
clearly outlined, possibly even in Will/Living
Will.
• Ask someone for an envelope carefully.

Trust
• If someone is holding your envelope,
make it clear up front that you’ll want to
inspect it regularly, and it’s not an insult.
• Obviously, be sure that you trust this
person with your most crucial, high-risk
information.

Inspecting your envelope
• Photos of the seal, other signature points,
for comparison
• UV illumination may reveal chemical
assault not obvious to the naked eye.

Other Thoughts on Storage
• Safety Deposit Box
– Make sure the right people are allowed to
access it without you
– You still need to check access logs, and
inspect your envelope
• Locked box
– Key can be held by another person
– Can be “sealed” as well as locked, strong
tape and a wax seal

How Often Should I Update?
• Ideal world:  As often as information
contained within an envelope changes.
• Realistically, this will vary extensively by
individual.
– My recommendation is to mentally examine your
envelope at least monthly, if not weekly, to decide if
important information has changed, and warrants an
update.

A “Hybrid” Envelope?
• USB Key
– Plaintext file
– Encrypted file
– Application specific encrypted database.  (Password
managers and the like.)
• Can still experience the tamper-detection
benefits of a physical envelope.

Hybrid Advantages
• Larger amount of information
• Lower risk of confusion, between human
eyes and print on paper.
• Possibility of multiple envelopes, one with
USB key, one with “Master Passphrase.”

Hybrid Disadvantages
• More attention to tamper-detection may
be required.
• Possible obsolescence of media.
• Possible media failure.
– Both of these last two should not be a concern, if one is
updating their envelope appropriately.

Why a Wax Seal?
• 5000 years proof-of-concept testing
• Sealing wax is very specifically designed
for adhesion and tamper detection.
• Every seal is as unique as a fingerprint
vs.
(Duh!)
but:

Why a Wax Seal?
• Without a paper Death Envelope, what
other excuse is there to make a custom
cDc or Løpht Heavy Industries wax seal?
