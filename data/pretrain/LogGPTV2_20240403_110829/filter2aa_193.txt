### About the Presenter
- **Background:** Matt Yoder is an advocate for the concept of the "Death Envelope" and aims to spread awareness about its importance.
- **Motivation:** Made a promise to a friend to create a resource if a good one was not available.
- **Interests:** Enthusiast of fine pens and paper, and a pencrafter.

## Introduction
The Death Envelope is a method to securely store critical information that should be accessible in case of incapacitation or death. This presentation will cover:
1. What is a death envelope, and what problem does it solve?
2. Who should have one, or ask for one?
3. What should be in a death envelope?
4. Security options for a death envelope.
5. Varied forms of solutions.

## What is a “Death Envelope”?
In today's high-tech society, important information is often stored only in individuals' minds. A death envelope is a highly-secured, tamper-resistant, and tamper-evident record of this information, ensuring it is available if the individual is unable to provide it.

### The Scope of the Problem
- High-tech users manage numerous passwords, with an average of 40 passwords, 15 of which are considered sensitive.
- Sources:
  - [Security Metrics](http://www.securitymetrics.org/content/Wiki.jsp?page=Welcome_blogentry_050208_1)
  - [Silicon Management](http://management.silicon.com/government/0,39024677,39126737,00.htm)

## Who Should Have a Death Envelope?
- Anyone with information they wish to be available after their death.
- Specifically:
  - Individuals with high-risk jobs (e.g., police, firefighters, military, skydivers, extreme sport enthusiasts).
  - Those with high-risk information (e.g., systems and network administrators).

## Who Should Ask for a Death Envelope?
- Managers/employers of systems and network administrators to minimize downtime if critical passwords are lost.
- Spouses/families of those with high-risk jobs or hobbies.

## What Should Be in Your Envelope?
- Any information stored only in your brain that people need access to if you are incapacitated or deceased.
- Examples:
  - Root/administrative passwords.
  - Online account username/password combinations (webmail, domain name administration, offsite information repositories, financial institutions).
  - Financial secrets (ATM card PIN, etc.).

## Death Envelope vs. Traditional Aftercare
- **Aftercare:** Reference material with lower risk if invaded (bank accounts, real estate, pension, retirement funds).
- **Death Envelope:** Highly sensitive information that should not be easily referenced.

## Handwriting vs. Computer
### Handwriting Advantages
- Difficult to intercept by authorities.
- Easy to create and update anywhere with simple tools.

### Computer Advantages
- Consistency and variety of useful fonts.
- OCR Fonts (e.g., OCR A Extended) and Monotype Fonts (e.g., Lucida Sans Typewriter) can enhance readability and security.

### Handwriting Tricks
- Slashed zeroes and underlined numerics.
- Slow down and shape letters carefully.
- Use graph paper to slow down writing and indicate spaces in passphrases.

### Computer/Font Tricks
- OCR Fonts: `PASSWORD/p4s5w0rd2z`
- Monotype Fonts: `password` vs. `p assw ord`
- Slashed zero: `P4S5WØRD` (Alt+0216 for large Ø, Alt+0248 for small ø)

## Bonus Paper Tricks
- Invisible inks (UV reactive, chemically reactive, temperature reactive).
- Water-soluble ink signature across the seal point.
- Acid-free paper and tamper-resistant inks (e.g., Fisher “Cellulock” Checkguard, Noodler’s “Eternal” Inks).

## The Human Factor
- Trust but verify.
- All parties should understand the importance of the envelope.
- Regular inspections and clear guidelines on when to open the envelope (possibly in a will/living will).

### Trust
- Make it clear that regular inspections are not an insult.
- Ensure the person holding the envelope is trustworthy.

### Inspecting Your Envelope
- Take photos of the seal and other signature points for comparison.
- Use UV illumination to detect chemical assaults.

## Other Thoughts on Storage
- **Safety Deposit Box:** Ensure the right people can access it without you and check access logs.
- **Locked Box:** Key held by another person, sealed with strong tape and a wax seal.

## How Often Should I Update?
- Ideally, as often as the information changes.
- Realistically, examine and update at least monthly or weekly.

## A “Hybrid” Envelope?
- **USB Key:** Contains plaintext, encrypted files, or application-specific encrypted databases (password managers).
- Can still benefit from the tamper-detection features of a physical envelope.

### Hybrid Advantages
- Larger amount of information.
- Lower risk of confusion between human eyes and print on paper.
- Possibility of multiple envelopes (one with a USB key, one with a master passphrase).

### Hybrid Disadvantages
- More attention to tamper-detection may be required.
- Possible obsolescence and media failure, mitigated by regular updates.

## Paper Alternatives
- **Plastics:** For durability and water resistance (Yupo, Teslin, Tyvek).
- **Limestone/Resin Papers:** Designed for inkjets (ViaStone, XTerrane, Terraskin).
- **Eco-Friendly Options:** Hemp, Kenaf, Bier Paper, Elephant Dung, Coffee Harvest Residue, Banana Harvest Residue.

## Why a Wax Seal?
- 5000 years of proof-of-concept testing.
- Sealing wax is designed for adhesion and tamper detection.
- Each seal is unique, like a fingerprint.
