User:  How to use Ansible to automate server configuration management?
Assistant: Using Ansible to automate server configuration management is divided into the following steps: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on the control host, which can be the developer's laptop or other servers. 2. Configure the Ansible host list: Define the servers and groups to be managed in Ansible's host list and associate them with the Ansible host list file. 3. Configure Ansible Playbook: Ansible Playbooks are scripts that describe configuration tasks and server status. With Playbooks, you define tasks and steps and tell Ansible how to execute those tasks. 4. Execute Ansible Playbook: When an Ansible Playbook is executed, Ansible connects to the managed server and performs configuration tasks. 5. Testing and Validation: Ansible can perform some testing operations to verify that the configuration is correct. To sum up, using Ansible to automate server configuration management can greatly reduce manual configuration work, improve system security and reliability, and reduce error rates.
