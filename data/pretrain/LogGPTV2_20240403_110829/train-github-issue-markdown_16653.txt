# Mergable Zones on Drag.
### See the two examples for clearance:
**A** : Merge Columns  
**B** : Merge Rows
Grid of 3x2
     v 3 Columns
     --- --- ---
    |   |   |   |  < 2 Rows
     --- --- ---
    |   |   |   |  
     --- --- ---
        v A: Drag to here to merge columns
     --- --- ---
    |   x   |   |  
     --- --- -x-  < B: Drag to here to merge rows
    |   |   |   |  
     --- --- ---
I would like to be able to create a grid of equal 6 squares. 3 columns and 2
rows.  
If I drag a window in the middle area between two rows or columns it would
merge them and use them both. For me that would make it not necessary to swap
out layouts between different tasks.
Btw, what an amazing utility. Thanks!!
