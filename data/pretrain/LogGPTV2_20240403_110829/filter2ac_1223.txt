**ATT&CK ID:** S0046  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** CozyCar

The CozyCar dropper disguises a copy of the infected system's `rundll32.exe` executable by moving it to the malware's installation directory and renaming it according to a predefined configuration file. [3]

In this revision, I have:
- Ensured consistent formatting for the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name.
- Improved the clarity and readability of the description.
- Used more precise terminology (e.g., "disguises" instead of "masqueraded").
- Added backticks around `rundll32.exe` for better readability.
