Question: "In a scenario where Alice and Bob are using a shared secret key to ensure the secure exchange of messages, why is it crucial for the effectiveness of Message Authentication Codes (MACs) that the secret key remains known only to Alice and Bob?"
 "A": "If an adversary knows the secret key, they could decrypt the message contents, violating the confidentiality of the communication."
 "B": "Knowledge of the secret key by an adversary would allow them to generate valid MACs, compromising the integrity and authenticity of the messages."
 "C": "The secret key is required for the recipient to decrypt the message and is irrelevant to the function of MACs."
 "D": "Sharing the secret key with third parties would increase the computational overhead for generating and verifying MACs."
Answer: B
