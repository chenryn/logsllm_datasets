# Create a Microsoft Entra application registration in Azure Data Explorer
Microsoft Entra application authentication is used for applications, such as an unattended service or a scheduled flow, that need to access Azure Data Explorer without a user present. If you're connecting to an Azure Data Explorer database using an application, such as a web app, you should authenticate using service principal authentication. This article details how to create and register a Microsoft Entra service principal and then authorize it to access an Azure Data Explorer database.
## Create Microsoft Entra application registration
Microsoft Entra application authentication requires creating and registering an application with Microsoft Entra ID.
A [service principal](#programatically-create-a-microsoft-entra-service-principal) is automatically created when the application registration is created in a Microsoft Entra tenant.
1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open the **Identity** blade
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/create-app-select-microsoft-entra-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select Microsoft Entra ID from the portal menu.":::
1. Select the **App registrations** blade and select **New registration**
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/create-app-new-registration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to start a new app registration.":::
1. Fill in the following information:
    * **Name**
    * **Supported account types**
    * **Redirect URI** > **Web**
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The application type should be **Web**. The URI is optional and is left blank in this case.
    * Select **Register**
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/create-app-register-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to register a new app registration.":::
1. Select the **Overview** blade and copy the **Application (client) ID**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You'll need the application ID to authorize the service principal to access the database.
1. In the **Certificates & secrets** blade, select **New client secret**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/create-app-new-client-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to start the creation of client secret.":::
    > [!TIP]
    > This article describes using a client secret for the application's credentials.  You can also use an X509 certificate to authenticate your application. Select **Upload certificate** and follow the instructions to upload the public portion of the certificate.
1. Enter a description, expiration, and select **Add**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/create-app-secret-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to enter client secret parameters.":::
1. Copy the key value.
    > [!NOTE]
    > When you leave this page, the key value won't be accessible.  You'll need the key to configure client credentials to the database.
Your application is created. If you only need access to an authorized Azure Data Explorer resource, such as in the programmatic example below, skip the next section. For delegated permissions support, see [configure delegated permissions for the application](#configure-delegated-permissions-for-the-application).
## Configure delegated permissions for the application
If your application needs to access Azure Data Explorer using the credentials of the calling user, configure delegated permissions for your application. For example, if you're building a web API to access Azure Data Explorer and you want to authenticate using the credentials of the user who is *calling* your API.
1. In the **API permissions** blade, select **Add a permission**.
2. Select **APIs my organization uses**. Search for and select **Azure Data Explorer**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/configure-delegated-add-api-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add Azure Data Explorer API permission.":::
3. In **Delegated permissions**, select the **user_impersonation** box and **Add permissions**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/provision-azure-ad-app/configure-delegated-click-add-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select delegated permissions with user impersonation.":::
## Grant a service principal access to an Azure Data Explorer database
Now that your application registration is created, you need to grant the corresponding service principal access to your Azure Data Explorer database. The following example gives viewer access. For other roles, see [Manage Azure Data Explorer database permissions](manage-database-permissions.md).
1. In the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/), connect to your database and open a query tab.
2. Execute the following command:
    ```kusto
    .add database  viewers ('aadapp=;') ''
    ```
    For example:
    ```kusto
    .add database Logs viewers ('aadapp=1234abcd-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-1234kl5678mn;9876abcd-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-1234kl5678mn') 'Azure Data Explorer App Registration'
    ```
    The last parameter is a string that shows up as notes when you query the roles associated with a database.
    > [!NOTE]
    > After creating the application registration, there might be a several minute delay until Azure Data Explorer can reference it. If, when executing the command, you receive an error that the application is not found, wait and try again.
For more information, see [Role-based access control](kusto/access-control/role-based-access-control.md).
## Programatically create a Microsoft Entra service principal
A Microsoft Entra service principal can be created through the [Azure portal](provision-azure-ad-app.md) or programatically, as in the following example.
1. Sign in to your Azure subscription via Azure CLI. Then authenticate in the browser.
   ```azurecli-interactive
   az login
   ```
2. Choose the subscription to host the principal. This step is needed when you have multiple subscriptions.
   ```azurecli-interactive
   az account set --subscription YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_GUID
   ```
3. Create the service principal. In this example, the service principal is called `splunk-uf`.
   ```azurecli-interactive
   az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "my-service-principal" --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{SubID}
   ```
4. From the returned JSON data, copy the `appId`, `password`, and `tenant` for future use.
    ```json
    {
      "appId": "1234abcd-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-1234kl5678mn",
      "displayName": "my-service-principal",
      "name": "my-service-principal",
      "password": "1234abcd-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-1234kl5678mn",
      "tenant": "1234abcd-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-1234kl5678mn"
    }
    ```
## Use application credentials to access a database
Use the application credentials to programmatically access your database by using the [Azure Data Explorer client library](kusto/api/netfx/about-kusto-data.md).
```C#
. . .
string applicationClientId = "";
string applicationKey = "";
string authority = "";
. . .
var kcsb = new KustoConnectionStringBuilder($"https://{clusterName}.kusto.windows.net/{databaseName}")
    .WithAadApplicationKeyAuthentication(
        applicationClientId,
        applicationKey,
        authority);
var client = KustoClientFactory.CreateCslQueryProvider(kcsb);
var queryResult = client.ExecuteQuery($"{query}");
```
   > [!NOTE]
   > Specify the application id and key of the application registration (service principal) created earlier.
For more information, see [authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID for Azure Data Explorer access](kusto/access-control/how-to-authenticate-with-aad.md) and [use Azure Key Vault with .NET Core web app](/azure/key-vault/tutorial-net-create-vault-azure-web-app#create-a-net-core-web-app).
## Troubleshooting
### Invalid resource error
If your application is used to authenticate users, or applications for Azure Data Explorer access, you must set up delegated permissions for Azure Data Explorer service application. Declare your application can authenticate users or applications for Azure Data Explorer access. Not doing so will result in an error similar to the following, when an authentication attempt is made:
`AADSTS650057: Invalid resource. The client has requested access to a resource which is not listed in the requested permissions in the client's application registration...`
You'll need to follow the instructions to [configure delegated permissions for the application](#configure-delegated-permissions-for-the-application).
### Enable user consent error
Your Microsoft Entra tenant administrator might enact a policy that prevents tenant users from giving consent to applications. This situation will result in an error similar to the following, when a user tries to sign in to your application:
`AADSTS65001: The user or administrator has not consented to use the application with ID '' named 'App Name'`
You'll need to contact your Microsoft Entra administrator to grant consent for all users in the tenant, or enable user consent for your specific application.
