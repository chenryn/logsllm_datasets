User: I need to run several python scripts simultaneously in the background, and have all the results be shown in 1 window, real time.  The background scripts will continue running, but as more info is outputted it should be shown inside 1 window.
I've tried os and subprocess, but to no avail.  This needs to work on all platforms.
Assistant: This is a shot in the dark, I haven't done much python, but could you not have your background scripts dump their results in a file and then have your window focus on updating when that file updates.
In linux you could write to a text file and then open another console window to tail that file.
