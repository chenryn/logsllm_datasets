# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
When I use webpack to bundle code that includes a Web Worker which contains a
dynamic import, the resulting code erroneously duplicates the file path of the
chunk that it's trying to load. Instead of requesting something like
`foo/bar/abc.[a1b2c3d4].chunk.js`, it requests
`foo/bar/foo/bar/abc.[a1b2c3d4].chunk.js`.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
I encountered this in the context of `create-react-app`, so that's how I
reproduce it. I don't know enough about webpack config to be able to distill
it down to the absolute minimum. The issue may be with `create-react-app` or
`webpack`.
My steps to reproduce are described in this bug report:
Duplicate path segment error in dynamic imports in Web Worker (react-scripts
5, webpack 5)
**What is the expected behavior?**
The path to the dynamically imported chunk should not have the duplicated path
in front of the file name.
