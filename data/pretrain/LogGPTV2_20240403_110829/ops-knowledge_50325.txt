I have projects in C++, Java, and Python. The C++ projects export SWIG interfaces to enable their use by the Java and Python projects.

My question is: What build system can I use to manage dependencies and build these projects effectively?

I have experience with SCons and GYP, which are relatively easy to use and support plugins (code generators, compilers, packers). I am interested in knowing if there are other alternatives, particularly those that natively support C++, Java, and Python.

I primarily develop on a Linux platform, but I would like the build system to be compatible with macOS and Windows as well.

Assistant: In my experience, using CMake for a project involving Java, C++, and C++-to-Java SWIG interfaces, along with Protocol Buffers, was quite challenging. The primary issue with CMake is that its scripting language is very limited, which can make complex builds difficult to manage. I switched to Scons, and the process became much simpler and more manageable. 

If you are looking for alternatives, you might also consider:
- **Bazel**: A powerful build tool developed by Google, which supports multiple languages including C++, Java, and Python. It has strong support for cross-platform builds.
- **Maven**: While primarily used for Java, it can be extended to handle C++ and Python through plugins.
- **Gradle**: Another popular build automation tool that supports multiple languages and platforms. It offers flexibility and extensibility through plugins and custom tasks.

These tools provide robust solutions for managing multi-language projects and can help streamline your build process across different platforms.
