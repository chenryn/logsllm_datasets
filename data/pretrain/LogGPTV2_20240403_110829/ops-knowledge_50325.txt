User: I have projects in C++, Java and Python. Projects in C++ export SWIG interfaces so they can be used by Java and Python projects.
My question is: what building mechanism can I use to manage dependencies and build these projects?
I have used SCons and GYP. They are fairly easy to use and allow plugins (code-generators, compilers, packers). I'd like to know whether there are alternatives, in particular with native support for C++, Java and Python.
I develop in Linux platform, but I'd like to be able to build in mac and win platforms as well.
Assistant: I tried to do a Java / C++ / C++ To Java swig / (+ Protocol buffers) project in CMAKE and it was horrible! In such a case the problem with Cmake is, that the scripting language is extremely limited. I switched to Scons and everything got much easier.
