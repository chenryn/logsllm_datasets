I recently installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Python on my Windows 7 system. I would like to access both programs from the command line, whether it be through `cmd` or `Cygwin`. To achieve this, I have been modifying the `PATH` environment variable each time I need to use one of these tools. 

Is there a way to configure the `PATH` so that both the JDK and Python are always accessible without needing to change the `PATH` variable every time?

Thank you.

**Response:**

To permanently add the paths to the JDK and Python to the `PATH` environment variable, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on "My Computer" (or "This PC" in newer versions of Windows) and select "Properties."
2. Click on "Advanced System Settings."
3. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. In the Environment Variables window, locate the `Path` variable under the "System variables" section and select it. Click "Edit."
5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click "New" and add the path to your JDK installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>\bin`).
6. Click "New" again and add the path to your Python installation (e.g., `C:\Python<version>`).
7. Click "OK" to close all the windows and save the changes.

**Note:** Only processes started after you make these changes will see the updated `PATH` variable. If you have any command line windows open, you will need to close and reopen them to apply the new `PATH` settings.

This should help you set up the `PATH` variable once and for all, making both the JDK and Python easily accessible from the command line.
