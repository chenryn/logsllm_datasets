User: I recently installed Java's JDK and Python in my Windows 7 system. I wanted to access both programs from the command line (whether it be cmd or cygwin) so I used the PATH global variable and entered the path to my JDK. What can I do so that python and JDK are accessed by PATH? What I am doing now is changing the PATH variable every time.
Thanks
Assistant: Right click on "My Computer"
Choose "Properties"
Click on "Advanced System Settings"
Click on "Environment Variables"
Find PATH and set it appropriately

Note that only processes started after you change the path will see the change.
