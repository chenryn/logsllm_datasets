## Abstract
RF-powered devices compute and communicate using only the energy harvested from radio frequency (RF) signals. While existing technologies can harvest power from ambient RF sources (e.g., TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated gateway (such as an RFID reader) for internet connectivity. We introduce Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RF-powered devices with the internet by reusing existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. To demonstrate the feasibility of Wi-Fi Backscatter, we built a hardware prototype and established the first communication link between an RF-powered device and off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices. Using Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, we achieved communication rates up to 1 kbps and ranges up to 2.1 meters. This capability paves the way for rapid deployment and adoption of RF-powered devices, enabling ubiquitous connectivity via nearby Wi-Fi-enabled mobile devices.

## 1. Introduction
It is increasingly feasible to perform low-end computing, sensing, and communication by harvesting power from ambient RF signals, including TV, cellular, and Wi-Fi transmissions. This technology is attractive because it can be embedded inexpensively into everyday objects, contributing to the vision of the "Internet of Things" (IoT): objects that operate and communicate without the need for batteries or wired power.

However, existing technologies lack the ability to connect RF-powered devices to the internet. Conventional radio communication consumes significantly more power than available from ambient RF, making it impractical for these devices. Techniques like ambient backscatter enable communication between RF-powered devices but create isolated networks disconnected from the internet. Deploying special-purpose powered infrastructure, such as RFID readers, to bridge this gap adds cost and diminishes the key advantage of RF-powered systems: operation without dedicated power infrastructure.

In this paper, we explore whether it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to connect RF-powered devices to the internet. Specifically, we aim to design RF-powered devices that can communicate directly with commodity Wi-Fi devices. A positive answer would facilitate the rapid and simple deployment of the RF-powered IoT, allowing these devices to connect to existing mobile phones and Wi-Fi access points (APs). It would also expand the functionality of Wi-Fi networks to support a new class of battery-free devices.

Achieving this is challenging because conventional low-power Wi-Fi transceivers require more power than available from ambient RF signals. Thus, it is not feasible for RF-powered devices to use the standard Wi-Fi protocol. Conversely, existing Wi-Fi devices, designed to receive Wi-Fi signals, may struggle to decode other kinds of signals from RF-powered devices.

We introduce Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system where RF-powered devices can communicate with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices by modulating the Wi-Fi channel. The Wi-Fi receiver extracts the modulated information by measuring changes in the channel, such as Channel State Information (CSI) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).

## 2. Wi-Fi Backscatter Overview
Wi-Fi Backscatter is a communication system that enables RF-powered devices to communicate directly with commodity Wi-Fi devices. It involves three main actors: a Wi-Fi reader, a Wi-Fi helper, and an RF-powered Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. The reader and helper can be any commodity Wi-Fi device, such as routers and mobile devices. For simplicity, we consider a Wi-Fi client (e.g., a mobile phone) as the reader and a Wi-Fi AP as the helper. The RF-powered devices are envisioned as wireless sensor nodes embedded in everyday objects, which can harvest energy from ambient RF signals, including TV, cellular, and Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi Backscatter can also provide internet connectivity to battery-free devices with other power-harvesting sources, such as solar and mechanical energy.

Wi-Fi Backscatter's communication has two main components: an uplink from the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag to the Wi-Fi reader and a downlink from the Wi-Fi reader to the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. It follows a request-response model similar to RFID systems, where the Wi-Fi reader queries the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag for information and receives a response on the uplink. In the presence of multiple tags, the reader can use protocols similar to EPC Gen-2 to identify and query each tag individually. However, this paper focuses on establishing a communication link with a single Wi-Fi Backscatter tag.

At a high level, the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag communicates by modulating the transmissions from the Wi-Fi helper. The Wi-Fi reader decodes these transmissions by using the channel changes created on the received Wi-Fi packets. For the downlink, the Wi-Fi reader transmits directly to the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag by encoding information in short Wi-Fi packets interspersed by silence. The tag decodes these transmissions using a low-power circuit design that can detect energy from Wi-Fi packets.

In the rest of this paper, we describe the design of the Wi-Fi Backscatter uplink in Section 3 and the downlink in Section 4. We then generalize our description to work in the presence of multiple Wi-Fi devices in Section 5. Finally, we evaluate our prototype in various scenarios.

## 3. Wi-Fi Backscatter Uplink
The Wi-Fi Backscatter uplink enables communication from an RF-powered device to the Wi-Fi reader. This is challenging because it is not feasible for these devices to use the standard Wi-Fi protocol. Instead, we transmit data by modulating the Wi-Fi channel as seen in the Wi-Fi reader's channel state information.

### 3.1 Modulating the Wi-Fi Channel at the Tag
The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag conveys information by modulating the Wi-Fi channel. It uses a low-power switch to modulate the antenna impedance based on the transmitted bit stream. The antenna's impedance affects the amount of signal reflected by the tag. By modulating this impedance, the tag can convey '1' and '0' bits. These switches consume less than 1 ÂµW of power, which is negligible. Our prototype design optimizes the choice of the switch to operate well across the entire 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band.

The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag can use various antennas, including monopoles and dipoles. For our prototype, we designed a microstrip "patch" antenna capable of both impedance modulation and Wi-Fi energy harvesting. The gain of this antenna is relatively high compared to its size. Our design considers the radar cross-section, which refers to the amount of incident Wi-Fi signals reflected by the antenna. To improve the radar cross-section, we designed an array of microstrip patches, each resonating at 2.4 GHz, to collaboratively scatter incident RF and produce a larger change in the radar cross-section.

Finally, the minimum period with which the tag changes its impedance is longer than the duration of a Wi-Fi packet. This ensures that the act of modulating does not change the channel within every Wi-Fi packet, minimizing interference with nearby Wi-Fi communication. The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag modulates the Wi-Fi channel only when queried by the reader and can adapt the modulation rate by increasing the duration of each bit, adapting the data rate to Wi-Fi network traffic conditions.

### 3.2 Decoding Algorithm at the Wi-Fi Reader
To extract the modulated Wi-Fi channel corresponding to the packets from the helper, we conducted an experiment. We placed an Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 card, acting as a Wi-Fi reader, next to a Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. The tag was configured to modulate an alternating sequence of zero and one bits. The Wi-Fi reader downloaded a 1 GB media file from a Linksys WRT54GL AP, acting as a Wi-Fi helper, placed 5 meters away from the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. Figure 3 shows the CSI in Wi-Fi sub-channel 19 as a function of the packet number, clearly indicating a binary modulation on top of the captured channel measurements.

Our decoding algorithm extracts this modulated information in three main steps:
1. **Signal Conditioning:** Remove natural temporal variations in the channel measurements due to mobility in the environment and normalize the channel measurements to map to -1 and +1 values.
2. **Exploiting Wi-Fi Frequency/Spatial Diversity:** Leverage the frequency diversity across the Wi-Fi sub-channels.
3. **Decoding the Backscattered Bits:** Decode the backscattered bits from the channel information.

#### 3.2.1 Signal Conditioning
The goal of signal conditioning is to remove temporal variations in the channel measurements and normalize them. We subtract a moving average from the channel measurements at the Wi-Fi reader, computed over a duration of 400 ms. This creates zero-mean channel measurements without temporal variations. We then normalize these measurements so that the channel corresponding to a one bit from the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag maps to a +1 and that corresponding to a zero bit maps to a -1. Since we do not know the actual bits transmitted, we perform this normalization by computing the absolute values of the zero-mean channel measurements and taking their average. We then divide the zero-mean channel measurements by this computed average to get the normalized channel values.

#### 3.2.2 Exploiting Wi-Fi Frequency/Spatial Diversity
Wi-Fi transmissions span a bandwidth of 20 MHz, providing significant frequency diversity. By leveraging this diversity, we can improve the robustness of the communication link. Figure 4 shows the probability density function (PDF) of normalized channel values for the 30 Wi-Fi sub-channels, highlighting the diversity between sub-channels.

## 4. Wi-Fi Backscatter Downlink
The Wi-Fi Backscatter downlink enables communication from the Wi-Fi reader to the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. The Wi-Fi reader encodes information in the presence or absence of Wi-Fi packets, and the tag decodes this information using a low-power circuit design that can detect energy from Wi-Fi packets.

### 4.1 Encoding Information in Wi-Fi Packets
The Wi-Fi reader encodes information by sending a pattern of short Wi-Fi packets. The presence (absence) of a short Wi-Fi packet encodes a '1' ('0') bit. The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag decodes this information using a low-power energy detector to differentiate between the presence and absence of Wi-Fi packets.

### 4.2 Low-Power Circuit Design for Detection
The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag uses a low-power circuit design to detect the energy from Wi-Fi packets. This circuit is optimized to detect Wi-Fi packets as short as 50 Âµs at distances up to 2.2 meters, translating to a bit rate of 20 kbps on the downlink. The downlink range can be extended to about 3 meters by reducing the bit rate to 5 kbps.

## 5. Generalizing to Multiple Wi-Fi Devices
In the presence of multiple Wi-Fi devices, the Wi-Fi Backscatter system must account for potential interference and coordinate the communication. We describe how the system can be generalized to work in such environments, ensuring reliable communication between the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag and the Wi-Fi reader.

## 6. Evaluation
To demonstrate the feasibility of our designs, we built prototype devices optimized to backscatter and harvest Wi-Fi signals across the entire 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band. We evaluated our prototype in various scenarios with commodity Wi-Fi devices, including Intel Wi-Fi cards and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure. Our results show the following:

- **Uplink Performance:** The Wi-Fi devices can reliably decode information on the uplink at distances of up to 65 cm and 30 cm using CSI and RSSI information, respectively, at bit rates ranging from 100 bps to 1 kbps. The uplink range can be increased to more than 2.1 meters by performing coding at the Wi-Fi device.
- **Ambient Wi-Fi Transmissions:** The uplink can operate using only the ambient Wi-Fi transmissions in the network. The Wi-Fi device can use RSSI information extracted from all the packets transmitted by the AP to achieve uplink bit rates between 100 bps and 200 bps, depending on the network load.
- **Downlink Performance:** The prototype can detect Wi-Fi packets as short as 50 Âµs at distances up to 2.2 meters, translating to a bit rate of 20 kbps on the downlink. The downlink range can be extended to about 3 meters by reducing the bit rate to 5 kbps.

## 7. Contributions
We make the following contributions:

- **Uplink Communication Channel:** We design an uplink communication channel that allows Wi-Fi Backscatter tags to convey information to Wi-Fi devices by modulating the Wi-Fi channel information, including CSI and RSSI.

While the bit rates demonstrated in this paper are not high, the ability to communicate at even low rates between RF-powered devices and existing Wi-Fi infrastructure is a significant capability that will be critical for the commercial adoption of an RF-powered Internet of Things.
