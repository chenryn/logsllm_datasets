Abstract– RF-powered computers are small devices that com-
pute and communicate using only the power that they harvest from
RF signals. While existing technologies have harvested power from
ambient RF sources (e.g., TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated
gateway (like an RFID reader) for Internet connectivity.
We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system
that bridges RF-powered devices with the Internet. Speciﬁcally,
we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure
to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show
Wi-Fi Backscatter’s feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and
demonstrate the ﬁrst communication link between an RF-powered
device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi
devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our or-
ganization’s Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates
of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe that
this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and
adoption of RF-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectiv-
ity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled.

INTRODUCTION
It is increasingly becoming feasible to perform low-end comput-
ing, sensing, and more recently communication [17] by harvesting
power from ambient RF signals including TV, cellular, and Wi-Fi
transmissions [26, 27, 22]. This technology is intriguing because it
may be embedded inexpensively into everyday objects to help real-
ize the pervasive vision of the “Internet of Things” [9]: objects that
operate and communicate with each other when they are nearby, all
without the need to ever plug them in or maintain batteries.
Existing technologies, however, lack the central component in
this vision of an RF-powered Internet of Things: an ability to con-
nect RF-powered devices to the Internet. Using conventional radio
communication to achieve this connectivity is challenging, since it
consumes orders of magnitude more power than is available in am-
bient RF [23]. Communication techniques like ambient backscat-
ter [17] enable these devices to communicate with each other; but

Figure 1—Wi-Fi Backscatter at a high level. The ﬁgure shows a
Wi-Fi Backscatter tag (an RF-powered device) communicating with
a Wi-Fi enabled mobile device. On the uplink, the Wi-Fi Backscat-
ter tag conveys information by modulating the CSI and RSSI mea-
surements received at the Wi-Fi device. On the downlink, the Wi-
Fi device conveys information by encoding bits in the presence or
silence of Wi-Fi packets. The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag uses its low-
power Wi-Fi packet detector circuit to decode this information.
they create an isolated network disconnected from the Internet. A
naïve solution is to develop and deploy special-purpose powered
infrastructure devices, along the lines of RFID readers, that can
connect the two networks. But deploying new support infrastruc-
ture adds cost and, more importantly, diminishes the key value-
proposition of RF-powered systems — an ability to operate without
dedicated power infrastructure.
In this paper, we ask if it is possible to reuse existing infrastruc-
ture to connect these devices to the Internet. Speciﬁcally, we seek
to design RF-powered devices that communicate directly with com-
modity Wi-Fi devices. A positive answer would pave the way for a
rapid and simple deployment of the RF-powered Internet of Things
by letting these devices connect to existing mobile phones and Wi-
Fi APs. It would also expand the functionality of Wi-Fi networks
in a new direction: from providing connectivity to existing Wi-Fi
clients to a whole new class of battery-free devices.
Achieving this capability, however, is challenging since conven-
tional low-power Wi-Fi transceivers require much more power than
is available from ambient RF signals. Thus, it is not feasible for RF-
powered devices to literally speak the Wi-Fi protocol. Conversely,
since existing Wi-Fi devices are speciﬁcally designed to receive Wi-
Fi signals, it is unclear how they would decode other kinds of sig-
nals from RF-powered devices.
We introduce Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system
in which RF-powered “things” can communicate with off-the-shelf
Wi-Fi devices. At a high level, a Wi-Fi Backscatter tag communi-
cates with a Wi-Fi device by modulating its Wi-Fi channel. Since
channel information including CSI and RSSI is widely available
on commodity Wi-Fi devices, the Wi-Fi receiver can extract the
modulated information by measuring the changes in its channel. To
understand this in more detail, consider the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag
and Wi-Fi enabled mobile device in Fig. 1. The Wi-Fi Backscatter
tag communicates by modulating the Wi-Fi channel as seen by the
mobile device. Speciﬁcally, it conveys a ‘1’ and a ‘0’ bit by either
reﬂecting or absorbing the Wi-Fi packets received by the mobile
device. The reﬂected signals change the per-packet CSI and RSSI
607measurements, which the mobile device uses to decode messages
from the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag.
We also enable downlink communication to the Wi-Fi Backscat-
ter tag. While the mobile device can send Wi-Fi packets directly
to the tag, the latter cannot decode Wi-Fi transmissions. Instead,
Wi-Fi Backscatter relies on low-power circuit designs that can de-
tect energy corresponding to a Wi-Fi packet (see §4.2). Speciﬁcally,
as shown in the ﬁgure, the mobile device sends a pattern of short
Wi-Fi packets — the presence (absence) of the short Wi-Fi packet
encodes the ‘1’ (‘0’) bit. The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag decodes this in-
formation by using our low-power energy detector to differentiate
between the presence and absence of Wi-Fi packets. In §4, we de-
velop the above ideas further and design Wi-Fi Backscatter to work
in the presence of multiple Wi-Fi devices in the network.
To show the feasibility of our designs, we build prototype de-
vices that are optimized to backscatter and harvest Wi-Fi signals at
frequencies spanning the entire 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band. We evaluate
our prototype in various scenarios with commodity Wi-Fi devices
including Intel Wi-Fi cards and the Wi-Fi infrastructure in our or-
ganization. We use the RSSI information that is widely available
on commodity Wi-Fi devices. We also use the Intel CSI toolkit [13]
to extract the ﬁner grained CSI information. Our results show the
following.
• The Wi-Fi devices can reliably decode information on the uplink
at distances of up to 65 cm and 30 cm using CSI and RSSI in-
formation respectively. This is achieved at bit rates ranging from
100 bps to 1 kbps. The uplink range can be increased to more
than 2.1 meters by performing coding at the Wi-Fi device.
• The uplink can operate using only the ambient Wi-Fi transmis-
sions in the network. Speciﬁcally, the Wi-Fi device can use RSSI
information extracted from all the packets transmitted by the AP
in our organization to achieve uplink bit rates between 100 bps
and 200 bps, depending on the network load.
• The prototype can detect Wi-Fi packets as short as 50 µs at dis-
tances of up to 2.2 meters; this translates to a bit rate of 20 kbps
on the downlink. The downlink range can be further extended to
about 3 meters by reducing the bit rate to 5 kbps.
Contributions: We make the following contributions:
• We introduce a novel communication system that connects RF-
powered devices (Wi-Fi Backscatter tags) to the Internet via ex-
isting Wi-Fi infrastructure.
• We design an uplink communication channel that allows Wi-Fi
Backscatter tags to convey information to Wi-Fi devices by mod-
ulating the Wi-Fi channel information including CSI and RSSI.
• We design a downlink communication channel where Wi-Fi de-
vices encodes information in the presence or absence of Wi-Fi
packets; the Wi-Fi Backscatter tags use low-power circuits to de-
tect Wi-Fi packets and decode this information.
• Finally, we build a hardware prototype for Wi-Fi Backscatter
and demonstrate the ﬁrst communication link between a Wi-Fi
Backscatter tag and commodity Wi-Fi devices.
While the bit rates demonstrated in this paper are not high, we
believe that the ability to communicate at even low rates between
RF-powered devices and existing Wi-Fi infrastructure is a signiﬁ-
cant capability that would be critical for the commercial adoption
of an RF-powered Internet of Things.
2. WI-FI BACKSCATTER OVERVIEW
Wi-Fi Backscatter is a novel communication system that enables
RF-powered devices to communicate directly with commodity Wi-
Fi devices. As shown in Fig. 2, Wi-Fi Backscatter has three main
Figure 2—Wi-Fi Backscatter Overview. It has three actors: a
Wi-Fi reader, a Wi-Fi helper, and a RF-powered device (Wi-Fi
Backscatter tag). The reader and helper can be any commodity Wi-
Fi device, including routers and mobile devices. The Wi-Fi reader
leverages the channel information from the Wi-Fi helper’s packets
to decode the transmissions from the tag.
actors: a Wi-Fi reader, a Wi-Fi helper, and an RF-powered Wi-Fi
Backscatter tag. In principle, the reader and helper can be any com-
modity Wi-Fi device, including routers and mobile devices. How-
ever, for ease of exposition, we consider a Wi-Fi client, such as a
mobile phone, to be the reader and a Wi-Fi AP to be the helper
device. We envision the RF-powered devices to be wireless sensor
nodes that are embedded in everyday objects. The Wi-Fi Backscat-
ter tags do not require any batteries and can harvest energy from
ambient RF signals including TV, cellular, and Wi-Fi. We also note
that Wi-Fi Backscatter can also be used to provide Internet connec-
tivity to battery-free devices with other power harvesting sources
including solar and mechanical energy.
Wi-Fi Backscatter’s communication has two main components:
an uplink from the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag to the Wi-Fi reader and a
downlink from the Wi-Fi reader to the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. Wi-
Fi Backscatter follows a request-response model, similar to RFID
systems. Speciﬁcally, the Wi-Fi reader asks the Wi-Fi Backscatter
tag for information on the downlink and receives a response on the
uplink. In the presence of multiple Wi-Fi Backscatter tags in the
vicinity, the interrogator can use protocols similar to EPC Gen-2 [2]
to identify these devices and then query each of them individually.
In this paper, however, we focus on establishing a communication
link with a single Wi-Fi Backscatter tag.
At a high level, Wi-Fi Backscatter imitates RFID communication
using a Wi-Fi device. Speciﬁcally, the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag com-
municates by modulating the transmissions from the Wi-Fi helper.
The Wi-Fi reader decodes these transmissions by using the channel
changes that are created on the received Wi-Fi packets. In princi-
ple, Wi-Fi Backscatter can have multiple Wi-Fi helper devices (e.g.,
multiple APs or other Wi-Fi client); in this paper, however, we focus
on using a single Wi-Fi helper device. For the downlink, the Wi-Fi
reader transmits directly to the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag by encoding
information in short Wi-Fi packets interspersed by silence. The tag
decodes these transmissions using a low-power circuit design that
can detect energy from Wi-Fi packets.
In the rest of this paper, we describe the design of the Wi-Fi
Backscatter uplink in §3 and the downlink in §4. We then generalize
our description to work in the presence of multiple Wi-Fi devices
in §5. Finally, we evaluate our prototype in various scenarios.
3. WI-FI BACKSCATTER UPLINK
Wi-Fi Backscatter enables communication on the uplink from an
RF-powered device to the Wi-Fi reader. This is challenging how-
ever because it is not feasible for these devices to speak the Wi-Fi
protocol. Instead we transmit data by modulating the Wi-Fi channel
as seen in the Wi-Fi reader channel state information. In this section
we describe the Wi-Fi Backscatter uplink in more detail.

3.1 Modulating Wi-Fi Channel at the tag
The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag conveys information by modulating
the Wi-Fi channel. To do this, it uses a low power switch that al-
lows the antenna impedance to be modulated by a transmitted bit
stream. The antenna’s impedance affects the amount of signal that
is reﬂected by the tag. By modulating this impedance, the tag can
convey ‘1’ and ‘0’ bits. These switches consume less than 1 µW
of power, which is negligible. Our prototype design optimizes the
choice of the switch to operate well at frequencies spanning the
entire 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band.
The Wi-Fi Backscatter tag can in principle use a variety of an-
tennas including monopoles and dipoles. For our prototype, we de-
signed a special-purpose antenna for the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag that
is capable of both impedance modulation as well as Wi-Fi energy
harvesting. Speciﬁcally, we design a microstrip “patch” antenna, as
the gain of this antenna can be relatively high with respect to its
size. Our antenna design takes into consideration a key factor of
system performance: the extent of radar cross section changes that
the antenna is capable of achieving. The radar cross-section refers
to the amount of incident Wi-Fi signals that can be reﬂected by an
antenna; the contrast between the radar cross-section when the tag
is reﬂecting versus not reﬂecting will determine the impact of the
tag on a nearby Wi-Fi receiver. To improve the radar cross-section,
we design an array of microstrip patches, each of which resonates at
2.4 GHz, but which act together to collaboratively scatter incident
RF and therefore produce a larger change in the radar cross-section.
Wi-Fi antenna design is a broad topic and one can use other antenna
topologies that can signiﬁcantly reduce the size of the antenna [18].
This, however, is not in the scope of this paper.
Finally, the minimum period with which our tag changes its
impedance is larger than the duration of a Wi-Fi packet. That is,
the duration of each transmitted bit is greater than the time it takes
to transmit a few Wi-Fi packets. This ensures that the act of modu-
lating does not change the channel within every Wi-Fi packet, thus
allowing nearby Wi-Fi communication to proceed with minimal in-
terference. We also note that the Wi-Fi Backscatter tag modulates
the Wi-Fi channel only when queried by the reader. Further, the tag
can adapt the modulation rate by increasing the duration of each
bit, enabling our tag to adapt the resulting data rate to the Wi-Fi
network trafﬁc conditions (see §5).
3.2 Decoding algorithm at the Wi-Fi reader
Next, we describe how the Wi-Fi reader extracts the modulated
Wi-Fi channel corresponding to the packets from the helper. To un-
derstand how the reﬂections at a Wi-Fi Backscatter tag affect the
Wi-Fi channel, we run the following experiment. We place an In-
tel Wi-Fi Link 5300 card, which acts as a Wi-Fi reader, next to a
Figure 4—PDF of normalized channel values for the 30 Wi-Fi
sub-channels. The plot shows diversity between sub-channels.
Wi-Fi Backscatter tag. We conﬁgure the tag to modulate an alter-
nating sequence of zero and one bits. The Wi-Fi reader downloads
a 1 GB media ﬁle from a Linksys WRT54GL AP, which acts as a
Wi-Fi helper. The helper is placed 5 meters away from the Wi-Fi
Backscatter tag. Fig. 3 plots the CSI in Wi-Fi sub-channel 19 as
a function of the packet number. The plot clearly shows a binary
modulation on top of the captured channel measurements.
Our decoding algorithm extracts this modulated information in
three main steps: (1) Signal conditioning to remove the variations in
the channel measurements due to mobility in the environment, (2)
Leveraging frequency diversity across the Wi-Fi sub-channels, and
(3) Decoding the backscattered bits from the channel information.
(1) Signal Conditioning. The goal of this step is two-fold: 1) re-
move the natural temporal variations in the channel measurements
due to mobility in the environment, and 2) normalize the chan-
nel measurements to map to -1 and +1 values. In particular, to re-
move the temporal variations, we subtract a moving average from
the channel measurements at the Wi-Fi reader; the moving aver-
age is computed over a duration of 400 ms in our experiments. The
above operation creates zero-mean channel measurements without
the temporal variations. Next, we normalize these measurements
such that the channel corresponding to a one bit from the Wi-Fi
Backscatter tag maps to a +1 and that corresponding to a zero bit
maps to a -1. Since we do not know the actual bits transmitted, we
instead perform this normalization by computing the absolute val-
ues of the zero-mean channel measurements and then taking their
average. We then divide the zero-mean channel measurements with
this computed average to get the normalized channel values.
(2) Exploiting Wi-Fi Frequency/Spatial Diversity. Wi-Fi trans-
missions span a bandwidth of 20 MHz. At such a wide bandwidth, it
