While creating a custom Spring Security AuthenticationProvider I stumbled on
the need for instances of both HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse.
There´s no way to easily access them. Modifying
org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextListener to register
both instances in Spring request scope would be ideal.
I´m trying to integrate Spring Security with Weblogic Servlet Authentication.
(http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E15051_01/wls/docs103/javadocs/weblogic/servlet/security/ServletAuthentication.html)
I see it becoming a major issue for any web container as JSR-196, which has
the same problem, made its way into JEE 1.6 specification.
