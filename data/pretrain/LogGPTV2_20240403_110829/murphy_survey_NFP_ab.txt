I. INTRODUCTION 
N network service degradations. An estimate published in 2018 	integrating new services, and thus increasing the cost of 	ETWORKS grow more complex, as they are constantlyindicates that small enterprises lose an average of $55,000 per year of profit due to downtime and another from 2019 estimates a loss of profit due to network downtime of $39,900 per year per hundred users [1], [2]. Such phenomena as the emergence of Industry 4.0 [3] and cloud computing [4] demonstrate the increasingly important economic role that networks will play in the world. Therefore there is an in-creasing need and interest in keeping the network running with minimal interruptions [5]–[13]. As a consequence, net-work management tools must evolve to meet this increasing demand and integrate systems that may detect, diagnose and predict failures [14]–[16].The field of Network Fault Management is dedicated to the growth of network dependability by detection of network faults, the analysis of the root cause of the fault, the mitiga-tion of failures (automated or not) and the prediction of fail-ures. Most network management systems that are deployed nowadays integrate network supervision and some aspect of automated network fault detection, and diagnosis. However few systems include fault prediction.Network Fault Prediction (NFP) could greatly improve dependability, or reliability, of networks and systems running on them, by allowing early interventions and mitigation, whether automated or not. This allows, on the one hand, to reduce intervention and network downtime costs, and on the other hand, to provide a better Quality of Experience (QoE) to the network’s users and better service overall [17]–[19]. There is also a distinct possibility in some cases to prevent the failure entirely, for example by system rejuvenation for instance as can be done for systems and applications running on network equipment (for some cases of failures) [20]. 	A study of NFP brings with it all the complexity inherent in the broader category of Fault Prognosis [21], but adds additional complicating factors. An example of one such being the lack of environmental controls. Distribution net-work equipment is often subjected to external influence (such as humidity, vibration, heat, impact, etc) since distribution network equipment is often not isolated in a technical room. These external factors constitute additional and unpredictable causes for equipment failure. We may also add that networks today are highly heterogeneous (see network heterogeneity in section II-A7), with many different sources of equipment, protocols and services interacting together. This increasesthe complexity of NFP and maintenance problems by intro-ducing more parameters to the problem [22]. Manufacturer heterogeneity in particular has been shown to increase the risk of faults [16]. Furthermore, an additional difficulty lies in the fact that new technologies are being introduced into the network, which means that as time progresses new types of faults will appear [23].As related works, there are several studies that review the state of the art in fault management for networks [22], [24]–[28] but we have found none that specifically tackle NFP. A comprehensive survey of all the applications of Ma-chine Learning for telecommunication networks is presented in [24], and fault management and NFP are presented in a part of the study. Mulvey et al. [28] provide a detailed sur-vey on the use of Machine Learning techniques for cellular network fault management. The different Machine Learning techniques and their advantages for the usage are presented and future research directions are given. Cherrared et al. [25] present the state-of-the-art of fault management techniques in Network Virtualization Environments. The following papers all deal with Software Defined Networks (SDN) [22], [26], [27]. Xie et al. [27] present a comprehensive survey of Machine Learning techniques applied to SDN, and briefly explains fault management. Both Fonseca et al. [22] and Yu et al. [26] describe fault management in SDNs but do not address NFP.The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of the methodology and outcomes of studies in NFP using ML and a description of the ML tools used in the process as there has been none yet published to our knowledge. The main contributions of this article are as follows.

• The expertise of a network and systems integrator in 	network maintenance and its application to NFP.• A systematic review of the Machine Learning methods that were used in the field, with a description of the algorithms.
• A survey of the state of the art of the methodology and results of NFP studies from 1997 to 2021, broken down by prediction type.
• Future research perspectives in the field.Throughout this article, the core definitions and concepts of NFP used are shared in section II, then an industrial actor’s expectations and needs based on its expertise are presented in section III, the Machine Learning methods that were used in the field are described in section IV, in section V the different applications of NFP to date are detailed, and perspectives for NFP are presented in section VI.II.

A. DEFINITIONS 
1) Network fault: B. CONCEPTS 
1) NFP
Network fault is defined as a state of a network or network equipment where a deviation exists from normal operational conditions. This state may devolve into a network failure.2) Network failure:
Network failure is a state of a network or network equipment where it fails to perform its purpose as intended. Failures may occur following different time spans. Complete Failure may be reached where the failure state prevents the entire equipment or network from performing its task [21].
3) Network fault management:3) Network fault management:
Network fault management describes research and processes specific to dealing with faults and failures in networks. Sub-components of Fault Management are fault detection, root cause analysis/localization, fault mitigation and fault predic-tion (NFP).
4) Network Fault Prediction (NFP):4) Network Fault Prediction (NFP):
Network Fault Prediction is the process by which incoming future failures is predicted. This process is based on past and present knowledge of the network state, gained by monitor-ing the network state.
5) Network monitoring:
Network Monitoring is the practice through which a service provider will monitor the operational state of the equipment constituting the network.6) Network dependability:
Network Dependability defines how much a network can be trusted to operate under any circumstance, and how it performs when a failure occurs. It is described along four axis which are Availability, Reliability, Maintainability and Survivability (ARMS) [29].
7) Network heterogeneity:Network Heterogeneity is the presence on the network of different systems that do not follow the same rules. This can be due to the equipment being from different manufacturers, using different technologies, using different protocols. It is accepted that as networks grow more heterogeneous, main-tenance and failure prediction becomes more complex [22], an example in optical networks being alien wavelengths appearing due to interoperability issues [30].8) Time ahead:
The time ahead of a prediction is defined here as the mini-mum amount of time between the moment the prediction was made, and the interval of time where the failure occurs. It can be seen as the ’X’ in Fig 2.
There are usually two alternative ways when trying to predict incoming Network Failures.We may choose to predict the Remaining Time To Failure (RTTF) of the equipment or network, which is a numerical metric. This is a more classical approach in the broader field of Prognosis and Health Management (PHM), where one would try to predict the Remaining Useful Lifetime of the equipment. In this case the problem becomes a supervised (we usually have the failure data) regression problem. To illustrate the case of the RTTF prediction, we show in Fig 1 a representation of the evolution of a generic prediction of RTTF over time.However, in the field of networks, predicting health state of the equipment or network during a specific interval of time in the future is more prevalent. This is a categorical value, which makes the problem a supervised classification problem where we usually predict the probability of an unhealthy state with a decision threshold. We illustrate this case with Fig 2. In this case, the predicted value always concerns information at the same approximate distance in time X compared to the present.In both cases however, different studies have wide dispari-ties in how they set the values of some variables :
• The sources from which the prediction is made. It can be data from a single or several pieces of equipment of the network, a single or several applications running on the network, a subnet or even the whole network.
• The types of faults considered. It could, for example, be hardware failure, application failure, or protocol fail-ures.• The time ahead gained by the prediction. This time needs to be sufficient for the prediction to be useful (e.g. automated system rejuvenation, or logistics for replace-ment) while permitting high prediction performance so that decisions can be taken based on the prediction.• The data type. Different types of data contain different levels of information at different intervals in time, which may severely impact the performance of the prediction system depending on the time gained that is targeted. Common examples of monitoring include SNMP (Sim-ple Network Management Protocol), syslog, and Net-Flow.
• The type of prediction that is made : health state; RTTF; 	or other.• The adequate prediction metrics and the expected per-formance levels associated with them. Some applica-tions may need good recall but could let precision be lower for example (see subsection II-B2).
• The width of the interval in the case of prediction of the health status of a network part. The width will have an impact on the precision of the information gained, but also on prediction performance (the wider the interval, the higher the probability that it will contain a failure).VOLUME 4, 2022 	3
