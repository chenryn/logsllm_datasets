### I. Introduction

As networks become more complex, integrating new services and increasing operational costs, the need for minimizing network service degradations becomes critical. According to a 2018 estimate, small enterprises lose an average of $55,000 per year in profit due to downtime. A 2019 estimate further indicates a loss of $39,900 per year per hundred users [1], [2]. The emergence of Industry 4.0 [3] and cloud computing [4] underscores the growing economic importance of networks, necessitating minimal interruptions.

Network management tools must evolve to meet these demands, incorporating systems that can detect, diagnose, and predict failures [5]–[13]. Network Fault Management (NFM) focuses on enhancing network dependability through fault detection, root cause analysis, failure mitigation, and prediction. While many current network management systems include supervision and automated fault detection, few integrate fault prediction capabilities.

Network Fault Prediction (NFP) can significantly improve network reliability by enabling early interventions and mitigations, reducing downtime and intervention costs, and enhancing the Quality of Experience (QoE) for users [17]–[19]. In some cases, NFP can even prevent failures entirely, such as through system rejuvenation [20].

NFP inherits the complexities of broader Fault Prognosis but faces additional challenges. For example, distribution network equipment is often exposed to external factors like humidity, vibration, and heat, which can lead to unpredictable failures. Additionally, the heterogeneity of modern networks, with diverse equipment, protocols, and services, increases the complexity of NFP [22]. New technologies also introduce new types of faults over time [23].

Several studies have reviewed fault management in networks [22], [24]–[28], but none specifically address NFP. This article aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in NFP using Machine Learning (ML), including definitions, core concepts, and a systematic review of ML methods and their applications from 1997 to 2021. The main contributions are:

- Definitions and core concepts of NFP.
- Insights from a network and systems integrator on maintenance and NFP.
- A systematic review of ML methods used in NFP, with algorithm descriptions.
- A survey of NFP studies, categorized by prediction type.
- Future research perspectives in the field.

### II. Core Definitions and Concepts

This section provides definitions and key concepts related to NFP.

#### A. Definitions

1. **Network Fault**: A state where a network or network equipment deviates from normal operational conditions, potentially leading to a network failure.
2. **Network Failure**: A state where a network or network equipment fails to perform its intended function. Failures can occur over different time spans, leading to complete failure where the entire network or equipment is non-functional [21].
3. **Network Fault Management**: Research and processes for handling faults and failures in networks, including fault detection, root cause analysis, fault mitigation, and fault prediction (NFP).
4. **Network Fault Prediction (NFP)**: The process of predicting future failures based on past and present knowledge of the network state, obtained through monitoring.
5. **Network Monitoring**: The practice of monitoring the operational state of network equipment by a service provider.
6. **Network Dependability**: The trustworthiness of a network to operate under any circumstance, measured by Availability, Reliability, Maintainability, and Survivability (ARMS) [29].
7. **Network Heterogeneity**: The presence of different systems in a network that do not follow the same rules, often due to equipment from different manufacturers, technologies, or protocols. Increased heterogeneity complicates maintenance and failure prediction [22], e.g., interoperability issues in optical networks [30].
8. **Time Ahead**: The minimum amount of time between when a prediction is made and the interval when the failure occurs. It is represented as 'X' in Figure 2.

#### B. Concepts

1. **NFP**: Predicting future failures based on network state monitoring. Two common approaches are:
   - **Remaining Time To Failure (RTTF)**: Predicting the numerical metric of how much time remains before a failure. This is a supervised regression problem, commonly used in Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) to predict the Remaining Useful Lifetime of equipment.
   - **Health State Prediction**: Predicting the health state of the network or equipment during a specific future interval. This is a supervised classification problem, where the probability of an unhealthy state is predicted with a decision threshold.

Both approaches vary in several aspects:
- **Data Sources**: Data can come from single or multiple pieces of equipment, applications, subnets, or the entire network.
- **Fault Types**: Can include hardware, application, or protocol failures.
- **Prediction Time**: Must be sufficient for useful actions (e.g., system rejuvenation or replacement logistics) while maintaining high performance.
- **Data Types**: Different data types (e.g., SNMP, syslog, NetFlow) contain varying levels of information, impacting prediction performance.
- **Prediction Type**: Can be health state, RTTF, or other metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**: Depending on the application, recall and precision may be prioritized differently.
- **Interval Width**: For health state predictions, the width of the interval affects the precision and probability of containing a failure.
