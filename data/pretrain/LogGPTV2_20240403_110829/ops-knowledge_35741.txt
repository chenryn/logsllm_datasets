User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Watchguard Mobile VPN with SSL - user can't connect - failed to open shared memory for openvpn command (error: 2) I have a problem with my Watchguard VPN. I've set up the device for SSLVPN (added policies, users, a group etc.) according to this description from the Watchguard docs.
The authentication itself works (no error about wrong login info with proper credentials, and I can see the user in the Firebox System manager), but I can't establish a connection after that. I'm using the Watchguard Mobile VPN with SSL Client, and when I try to login, the log outputs the following:

2015-02-26T09:36:41.230 Requesting client configuration from
[myIP]:443
2015-02-26T09:36:54.223 VERSION file is 5.22, client
version is 5.22
2015-02-26T09:36:54.742 failed to open shared memory
for openvpn command (error: 2), please check the WatchGuard SSLVPN
Service
2015-02-26T09:36:54.743 Failed to launched openvpn. retCP=0

Now I have to admit that configuring and managing a this thing is not usually one of my tasks and I haven't done it before, so if any info is still missing, please ask and I will supply whatever is needed. I don't really know what to do, because I'm pretty sure I've done everything according to the manual.
While googling, the only instance of this exact error message was a case where there was a difference between the client and the server version, but I've already checked that (both are version 11.9).
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Assistant: To be REALLY sure, that you have the same client version as on the Firebox, you can download the client directly from the firebox itself by opening https://Firebox_IP/sslvpn.html

In your case I'd try to reinstall the client. It looks much like there went something wrong during the installation or something corrupted it later.

Takes just 5 minutes, so it's worth giving it a try.
