**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Segmentation

To enhance security, implement network segmentation and control the movement of software between business and operational technology (OT) environments. This can be achieved through the use of one-directional demilitarized zones (DMZs). Additionally, web access from the OT environment should be restricted. Engineering workstations, including transient cyber assets (TCAs), should have minimal connectivity to external networks, such as the Internet and email. Furthermore, limit the extent to which these devices are dual-homed to multiple networks.
