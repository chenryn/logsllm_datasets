User:  Please introduce the differences between common web servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.
Assistant: 1. Apache Apache is one of the most popular web servers. It is the first choice of many website developers and web administrators because of the rich features and extensibility it offers. Apache's modular structure makes it relatively easy to add components and extend, so it is often used for advanced web development and complex web applications. Apache supports different programming languages and systems such as Java and Ruby in addition to the popular PHP, Perl and Python. 2. Nginx Nginx is a high-performance web server designed to solve some of Apache's performance and performance issues. Unlike Apache, Nginx has an event-based shared memory model, which helps it fight CPU or network bottlenecks. In addition, Nginx can easily manage high-load traffic and supports reverse proxy and HTTP caching to improve web performance. Due to its optimization for high volume and mixed loads, Nginx is widely used in large web applications. 3. IIS IIS is Microsoft's Web server, which was originally designed for Windows operating systems. IIS has many features such as support for .NET framework and ASP.NET applications. It can be tightly integrated with other Microsoft products, such as SQL Server and Active Directory, to provide a single point of management. IIS also supports the iSCSI protocol for data sharing between virtual hosts, WebDAV protocol and FTP services. Summary Choosing the best web server among Apache, Nginx and IIS depends on your needs and preferences. Apache is probably the best option if you need a highly scalable and flexible server. If you need optimized performance and the ability to handle heavy traffic, Nginx may be the best fit. If you need business web applications that rely on Windows and Microsoft technologies, IIS is probably the best choice.
