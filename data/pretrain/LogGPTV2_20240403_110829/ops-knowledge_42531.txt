User: Please list several commonly used network planning methods and explain their applicable conditions.
Assistant: 1. Model-based planning method: This method describes the network planning problem by establishing a mathematical model, and obtains the optimal network planning scheme by solving the model. It is suitable for network planning problems that need to consider various uncertain factors and require complex calculations or optimization. 2. Rule-based planning method: This method regulates various decisions and actions in network planning by formulating rules and systems, so as to achieve expected goals and expected results. It is suitable for network planning problems with small scale, relatively stable situation and strong predictability. 3. Experience-based planning method: This method summarizes the empirical mode of planning decision-making by analyzing historical data, cases and experience, so as to be used in actual network planning. It is suitable for network planning problems with complete and reliable historical data, or network planning problems that need to rely on experience when facing more complex problems. 4. Consultation-based planning method: This method is to reach consensus and goals through consultation, negotiation and collaboration with relevant parties. It is applicable to situations where network planning decision-making involves multiple interests, or when faced with some complex, difficult-to-quantify, and highly uncertain network planning issues.
