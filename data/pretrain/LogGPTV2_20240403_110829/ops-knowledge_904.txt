User: There is a server that needs to be repaired due to a hardware failure, but the applications running on the server cannot be interrupted. Please provide a temporary solution to ensure the normal operation of the application.
Assistant: The server can be replaced as one of the clusters, that is, all applications inside the server are migrated to another server, and then the server is temporarily taken offline for maintenance. During maintenance, the normal functioning of the application can be ensured. After the maintenance is completed, the original application on the server will be migrated back to realize seamless switching.
