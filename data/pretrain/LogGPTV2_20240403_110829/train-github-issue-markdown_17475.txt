Here's the warning message:
    sklearn/externals/joblib/hashing.py:197: DeprecationWarning: Changing the shape of non-C
     contiguous array by descriptor assignment is deprecated. To maintain the Fortran contiguity of a 
    multidimensional Fortran array, use 'a.T.view(...).T' instead
      obj_bytes_view = obj.view(self.np.uint8)
The fix is already commited to the joblib repo, but it's not released yet.
I wasn't sure how you guys handle joblib updates, so I didn't create the pull
request.
