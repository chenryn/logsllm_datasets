**Please let us know what functionality you would like to see in Playwright and provide details about your use case.**

One feature I would like to see is a special locator that can visually locate an element. In Taiko, a browser automation library developed by ThoughtWorks, you can visually locate elements using a proximity locator. For example:
```javascript
click(checkbox(near("Username")))
```
Taiko refers to this as a "proximity locator." You can find more information [here](https://docs.taiko.dev/#smart-selectors).

This type of locator can significantly reduce the flakiness of test scripts and lower maintenance costs because it does not depend on the HTML structure, which may change over time. While assigning `data-testid` attributes is also useful, a visual locator can be particularly beneficial in certain scenarios.

**Do you think others might benefit from this feature as well?**

Yes, I believe many users would find this feature valuable.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further adjustments.
