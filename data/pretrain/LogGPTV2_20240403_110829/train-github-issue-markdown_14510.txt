 **Let us know what functionality you'd like to see in Playwright and what is
your use case.**  
A special locator to visually locate an element.
In taiko, browser automation library by thoughtwork, you could locate element
visually like the following:  
`click(checkbox(near("Username")))`
Taiko calls it proximity locator  
Refer: https://docs.taiko.dev/#smart-selectors
This locator will reduce the flakiness of the script and the maintenance cost
because the locator doesn't rely on html structure that may be changed from
time to time. Even we can assign data-testid attribute but this is very useful
in some cases as well.
**Do you think others might benefit from this as well?**  
Yes, it is.
