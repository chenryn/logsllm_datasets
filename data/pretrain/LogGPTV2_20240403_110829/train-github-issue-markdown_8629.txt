This just tripped me but I'm not sure if it's intended behavior. Feel free to
close if it's not an issue.
Basically I re-export a few functions in my lib's `index.js`:
    export { default as DragDropContext } from './DragDropContext';
    export { default as DragLayer } from './DragLayer';
    export { default as DragSource } from './DragSource';
    export { default as DropTarget } from './DropTarget';
In my app, I import them:
    import { DragLayer } from 'react-dnd';
I just realized that this assigns them implicit context of `index.js`'s
`exports` object because when I use them later, they are invoked “on it”:
    export default DragLayer(...)
becomes
    exports['default']) = _reactDnd.DragLayer(...)
and thus `this` inside `DragLayer` points to `exports` in `index.js`.
How do I solve this?
