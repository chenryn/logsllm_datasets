### Government Productivity and Cost Reduction through Electronic Services

Governments are under increasing pressure to significantly enhance productivity and reduce costs. One targeted area for improvement is the provision of electronic services. The European Commission addresses these challenges through its 2020 Strategy and Digital Agenda flagship initiatives. A report titled "Digital by Default or by Detour?" published in May 2013, surveyed 28,000 internet users across 27 European countries. The study found that 73% of citizens declare their taxes online, 57% change their address, and 56% apply for higher education online.

#### Key Findings from the Report

1. **Innovation Transformation**:
   - Innovative e-government services require a transformation that leverages smarter technology, social media, and collaborative platforms.
   - Citizen-oriented strategies and the exploitation of hidden knowledge through data analytics are essential.
   - Generating innovative services, however, remains a complex task.

2. **Service Design**:
   - Governments have not fully embraced service-oriented thinking.
   - A shift is needed from ad hoc management to systematic design centered around user needs.
   - User satisfaction with online services varies from 41% to 73%, indicating the use of different approaches in service design.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The increasing number of automated and self-service options generates valuable data.
   - Advanced algorithms and analytical tools can improve service delivery efficiency and customer experience.
   - 80% of online public services save time, 76% provide flexibility, and 62% reduce costs.

4. **Transparency**:
   - Current services often lack transparency, with execution rates below 50%.
   - More transparency is needed to inform citizens about internal processes.
   - While some basic data is provided, there is a need for more information on services that empower citizens.

5. **Business Models**:
   - Opening up data can enable new business models and economic gains.
   - The direct impact of Open Data in Europe was estimated at €32 billion in 2010, with an annual growth rate of 7%.
   - However, few governments are fully exploiting the economic benefits of Open Data.

### Digital Technologies as a Fundamental Pillar

Digital technologies will be a fundamental pillar of future public service delivery, diverging from traditional government operations. Europe is implementing a serious strategy for digital services at the government level, and similar efforts are visible globally. Three of the most advanced governments in this field include the UK, New Zealand, and the US.

- **UK**: Adopted a "digital by default" approach and provides a guide and resources (gov.uk/service-manual) for delivering digital services.
- **New Zealand**: Following similar steps and mirroring the UK's progress (beta.govt.nz).
- **US**: The White House issued the directive "Building a 21st Century Digital Government" on May 23, 2012, aiming to enable more efficient digital service delivery.

### eGovernment Benchmark 2012 – INSIGHT Report

The 2012 e-Government benchmark includes a demand-side survey of 28,000 internet users across 32 EU countries, exploring 27 questions and 19 common citizen services. The survey provides a comprehensive view with 95% confidence, offering insights at both country and EU levels.

#### Key Insights from the User Survey

- **Barriers to eGovernment Use**:
  - 46% of public service users used eGovernment services.
  - 54% preferred traditional channels.
  - 21% were unaware of relevant websites.
  - 24% could not use eGov services, mainly due to difficulty.

- **Fulfillment and Benefits**:
  - 47% of eGovernment users fully achieved their goals.
  - 46% only partially received what they wanted.
  - Satisfaction with eGovernment services is lower than with eBanking services.

- **eGovernment Satisfaction**:
  - Satisfaction with eGovernment services is significantly lower than with eBanking services.
  - 21% were not aware of relevant websites.
  - 24% could not use eGov services, mainly due to difficulty.

- **Least Popular eGov Services**:
  - Reporting a crime (41%)
  - Starting a new job (41%)
  - Applying for disability allowance (42%)

### Developing Electronic Services

Electronic services are realized through software programs that utilize existing technical infrastructures, such as the customer’s access device, the internet, and the provider’s data center and information systems. Developing an electronic service involves creating a software program, typically a web application.

- **Web Applications**:
  - Web applications are software programs residing on the provider’s server, using the client’s web browser as the presentation layer.
  - Communication occurs via standard internet protocols like HTTP.
  - Popular programming languages for web applications include Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and .NET.
  - HTML and JavaScript are commonly used to create dynamic and interactive content.

### Evolution of Programming Paradigms

#### Subroutines

- **Origins**:
  - In the 1950s, programmers isolated frequently used functions into subroutines.
  - Subroutines reduced development and maintenance costs and increased quality and reliability.

#### Components

- **Reusability**:
  - Over time, pre-programmed objects or components became common.
  - Programmers composed applications using reusable components stored in software libraries.
  - This style of programming, called component-based software development, evolved into distributed services.

#### Business Process Modeling

- **Modeling**:
  - Business process modeling (BPM) is used to compose services into business applications.
  - BPM provides graphical notations that are intuitive for business users and formal enough for complex business semantics.
  - BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a widely accepted standard for BPM.

#### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- **Definition**:
  - SOA is an architectural style and business-centric programming paradigm for developing distributed systems.
  - Systems consist of software clients (service consumers) and software providers (service providers).

- **Composition and Decomposition**:
  - Smaller, repetitive tasks are separated from larger business applications and put into a service repository.
  - Good decompositions have little interaction between components and high functional coherence within components.
  - Poor decompositions involve too many interactions, making interfaces difficult to manage.

By embracing these paradigms and leveraging digital technologies, governments can transform their operations to be more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly.
