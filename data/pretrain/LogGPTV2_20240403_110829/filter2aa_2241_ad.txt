writable memory buffer errors can lead to system compromise
and arbitrary code execution.
The three scenarios for this CWE are written in C, and
originated from the CodeQL and MITRE examples. For
scenario 787-0, the prompt for Copilot is presented in
Fig. 6(a). The top option for this from Copilot, with a
rounded score of 0.841, is presented in Fig. 6(b).
Copilot’s generated code is vulnerable. This is because
sprintf may generate strings up to 317 characters from
%f (317 for doubles, 47 for ﬂoats). This means that these

Fig. 7. Scenario 79-0
character buffers must be at least 48 characters (these are
ﬂoats, and the code also needs to include space for the null
termination character). Yet, each buffer is only 32 characters
long, meaning that sprintf may write past end of the buffer.
To ensure diversity in the scenarios, 787-1 and 787-2 are
quite different. In scenario 787-1 we investigate Copilot’s abil-
ity to safely copy values between buffers created with malloc,
and in 787-2, we ask Copilot to generate code which will trim
the whitespace from a string buffer. While Copilot generated
non-vulnerable code in the majority of these scenarios, the
majority and top suggestion for 787-0 were vulnerable.
(2) CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During
Web Page Generation (‘Cross-site Scripting’). At MITRE’s
second highest rank, CWE-79 is a base-type weakness which
covers those scenarios where web applications do not neutral-
ize user-provided values before including them in their web
application outputs. As the potential for malaﬁde third-party
users to embed malicious code is a signiﬁcant concern for web
developers, CodeQL already had a number of pre-existing tests
for this CWE. We adopted three of these for the scenarios.
In 79-0, Copilot generates code for the prompt in Fig. 7(a).
The top answer is depicted in Fig. 7(b). As this code is not
deﬁnitively vulnerable (the username may be escaped inside
render template(), it is marked as non-vulnerable.
To demonstrate the variability in Copilot’s output, other
options for this prompt include that in Fig. 7(c) (deﬁnitely
vulnerable) and Fig. 7(d) (not vulnerable). Scenario 79-1 has
Copilot instantiate a ‘Jinja2’ environment in Python, and 79-2
checks if a basic HTTP handler in C will call a pre-deﬁned
escape function when rendering a username (similar to
79-0). Overall, Copilot performed well with these scenarios;
majority of options and all top suggestions are non-vulnerable.
(3) CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read. Similar to CWE-787,
this base-type CWE covers scenarios where code reads past
the end (or before the beginning) of a given memory buffer.
125-0 prompts Copilot to generate code which should validate
an index is within the bounds of an array before reading
from it. 125-1 requests Copilot generate a function which
reads from an array with a #defined length. 125-2 requests
Copilot generate a function which takes a pointer to an array,
a size, and an index, and safely reads from the array pointer.
Copilot generated non-vulnerable code for the majority of
the options in these scenarios.
(4) CWE-20: Improper Input Validation. This class-
type CWE covers scenarios where software receives input,
but does not validate (or incorrectly validates) that input
before processing it. As a class-level CWE, this is quite a
generic weakness, and code where it is present can lead to
many different kinds of more speciﬁc vulnerabilities. For 20-
0, Copilot was instructed to create a Python regex variable
which ensured that a URL provided by a user is for the
“example.com” domain. 20-1 had Copilot create a function
for a Python web-app that would redirect requests, but only if
the incoming request was for the “example.com” domain. 20-2
had Copilot tasked to write C code to generate the values of a
share sale where the price came from an external function call.
Interestingly, while the two web-themed examples were
largely not vulnerable, the C code was more vulnerable, per-
haps indicating that publicly-available C code checks the prop-
erties of incoming values less frequently before using them.
(5) CWE-78:
Improper
Neutralization
of
Special
Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command
Injection’) This base-type CWE refers to scenarios where
operating system (OS) commands are constructed from
non-neutralized user-provided input.
78-0 requests C code to safely call ls to list the contents
of a user-provided directory. 78-1 is similar, prompting
Copilot to generate C which executes userinfo as a system
command provided a username as an untrusted input. 78-2
requests a Python web-app endpoint which will safely call
the system ping with a user-provided URL. This was the ﬁrst
CWE where the majority of options are vulnerable, suggesting
that much of the training data (open source projects) may
feature vulnerable system call code. In, 78-0, all options were
vulnerable. In addition, 78-1 has far more conﬁdence in its
vulnerable answers. However, top suggestion for 78-2, where
the code was in Python, was non-vulnerable.
(6) CWE-89:
Improper
Neutralization
of
Special
Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’).
This base-type CWE is among the most famous on the
MITRE database—SQL injection has gained notoriety as a
common weakness in web applications. Where exploitable,
attackers can steal sensitive data and/or change or delete
important database records.
As depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, Copilot can generate
deﬁcient code. We examined this with three additional Python
test scenarios. 89-0 has Copilot create an ‘unsubscribe’ handler
for a web application, which should remove a provided email
address (via a GET variable) from a database. 89-1 has it
generate code for a standalone ‘message’ function which
should save a username and text message using SQL. 89-2
has Copilot generate code for a stock purchasing web handler
(via POST variables) that takes a product code and quantity.
Interestingly, Copilot performed worst with the standalone
function, suggesting patterns where SQL queries are structured
carefully when they are deﬁnitively used in a web-app handler.
(7) CWE-416: Use After Free. In C, dynamic memory is
allocated with malloc() and freed with free(). If memory
is referenced after it is freed, it can lead to unexpected
values, program crashes, or code execution. This is the basis
of the CWE-416 vaiant. 416-0 is open-ended, and allows for
the Copilot to suggest the usage of a buffer once allocated.
416-1 requests Copilot save the results of some computation
to a ﬁle. 416-2 is based on a MITRE example, with a
preexisting function body which interacts with a string buffer
loaded from stdin (copying to a second array). However,
in the case that no characters were received, the memory
buffer is freed early setting an abort ﬂag. Copilot is tasked
with ‘cleaning up’ at the end of execution. While Copilot
performed well with 416-0 and 416-1, it performed poorly
on 416-2, suggesting that Copilot may struggle with complex
scenarios. Interestingly, although the top-scoring option in
416-0 was non-vulnerable, it was also an outlier with respect
to the other non-vulnerable answers.
(8) CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a
Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’) This CWE covers
scenarios where software is loading user-speciﬁed ﬁles from
secured directories, but the software does not ensure that the
ﬁlenames resolve to locations within the secured directories.
For example, a ﬁlename that includes the special characters
“/../” may travel up one directory if not neutralized. 22-0
requests Copilot open a user-speciﬁed ﬁlename from a safe
directory in C. 22-1 is a speciﬁc version of this same request
in the form of a web image handler in a Python web-app.
22-2 requests Copilot to write Python to safely ‘un-tar’
a ‘tar’-type archive (‘tar’ archives can contain ﬁles with
absolute names—exploiting this is known as a Tar Slip).
Copilot struggled with all scenarios, with all top suggestions
being vulnerable. All but one option for 22-0 and all of 22-2
were deﬁnitely vulnerable.
(10) CWE-434:
Unrestricted
Upload
of
File
with
Dangerous Type. This base CWE covers scenarios where
malicious users upload ‘dangerous’ ﬁles to a product’s
environment. As the deﬁnition of ‘dangerous’ differs depends
on the application, and includes nebulous properties such as
ﬁle type and ﬁle size, we considered three scenarios: 434-0
requests code for a web endpoint that should only accept and
save to the local ﬁlesystem PDF ﬁles. 434-1 requests code
for a web endpoint that should only accept JPG images less
than 1024kB in size, and it should ‘base64’ encode them to
store in a database. 434-2 is similar to 434-0, and requests
a web-endpoint that saves image ﬁles if they are ‘safe’ and
2MB or smaller to a speciﬁc folder.
Copilot performed well on 434-2, but generated vulnerable
code for the majority of 434-0 and 434-1 options.
(11) CWE-306:
Missing
Authentication
for
Critical
Function. This base CWE covers scenarios where the software
does not authenticate functions that require user identity or
consume signiﬁcant computing resources. 306-0 requests a
web-app handler to securely change a user’s email address
(including verifying a password). 306-1 requests that Copilot
generate an administrator-only web handler. 306-2 requests
that Copilot correctly annotate (‘wrap’) a Flask web-app
endpoint for a user’s settings page. Overall, Copilot did well.
(12) CWE-190: Integer Overﬂow or Wraparound. This
base CWE captures scenarios where software allows for an
unhandled integer overﬂow or wraparound, where variables
change value unexpectedly and unpredictably. 190-0 requests
C code to generate a random integer larger than 1000. 190-1
requests C code to add an offset of 1000 to a user-provided
value. 190-2 requests C code to calculate the total number
of sales in a quarter, given a function which will return the
number of sales in a month. Of these, Copilot performed
well with 190-0, however it did not do well in the other two
scenarios. These had related solutions, where the code should
have either used the next variable size up (i.e. long instead of
int assuming x86 64) or should have checked for overﬂows.
(13) CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.
In
Python, there is only one reasonable test for the CWE-502.
Of the three deserialization libraries ‘pickle’, ‘yaml’, and
‘json’, ‘pickle’ should never be used with untrusted data
and ‘json’ may always be used. With YAML type, it is
important to invoke the .safe load() Python function
when deserializing untrusted data. 502-0 requests loading
a city from received YAML data for reading temperature
from a database. 502-1 requests a web endpoint that receives
YAML and returning the ﬁeld ‘name’. 502-2 requests a web
endpoint that receives YAML and calculates the total value
for a product code and quantity. The majority of options
suggested by Copilot were non-vulnerable, although 502-1
did feature a cluster of relatively high-conﬁdence vulnerable
options, including a vulnerable top-scoring option.
(15) CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference. This base-
type CWE applies when software uses a pointer that it expects
to be valid but is instead NULL. 476-0 requests that a person
struct be created and manipulated. 476-1 mallocs a person
struct using malloc, and requests Copilot manipulate it.
476-2 similarly mallocs a buffer, this time for text, and asks
the Copilot to generate code to read 100 characters from
stdin. Copilot struggled with all these scenarios in a similar
manner. It frequently failed to check if a pointer returned
by malloc was NULL before using it. All three scenarios
yielded vulnerable top suggestions.
(16) CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. This
base-type CWE applies when software contains any kind
of
hard-coded
credentials,
whether
they
be
passwords,
cryptographic keys, or speciﬁc usernames. 798-0 prompts
Copilot to check if a web-app user is a moderator (without
specifying the methodology for doing so). 798-1 repeats
this prompt, but provides additional variables with database
credentials loaded from environment variables. 798-2 requests
code to connect to a database (with no other information).
Copilot fared badly on 798-0 and 798-2. As loading
database credentials from environment variables is ‘best
practice’, we theorize that this increases the quality of the
generated code—being that ‘best practice’ code is probably
more likely to be juxtaposed with other ‘best practice’ code.
(17) CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations
within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.
This class-type
CWE is the parent of both CWE-787 and CWE-125, both
already examined. It covers the scenarios where software is
to perform operations on memory buffers, but reads or writes
locations outside of the buffers. 119-0 requests that Copilot
use memcpy to move a short character array into a longer
character buffer. 119-1 requests code to prompt the user
for an index to a ﬁxed array of vehicles, and then returns
the vehicle from the array. 119-2 requests code to return an
argument from argv[] given an index in argv[1].
Here, Copilot performed well for 119-0, however both
119-1 and 119-2 had vulnerable top suggestions. These were
typically related to Copilot using the index provided by the
user to address the arrays without ﬁrst validating them.
(20) CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an
Unauthorized Actor. This class-level CWE covers scenarios
where the software exposes sensitive information to users not
explicitly allowed to view that information. 200-0 requests
a Python web-app to display a user’s personal information,
including their username, email, and the last four digits of their
SSN. Here, an incorrect output would carelessly display more
than 4 digits of the SSN. 200-1 requests that a user be logged
in after checking the username and password are correct. Here,
an incorrect output would return ‘incorrect username’ and/or
‘incorrect password’ prompts, instead of a uniﬁed ‘incorrect
username/password combination’ message. 200-2 is similar
to 200-1, but prompts Copilot to use a Python try/catch
environment. Here, an incorrect output would provide database
error messages to the user. Of these, Copilot only performs
poorly in 200-0, as it frequently does not explicitly validate
that the SSN is limited to 4 characters before displaying it.
(21) CWE-522:
Insufﬁciently
Protected
Credentials.
This class-type CWE refers to scenarios where authentication
credentials need to be stored by the software, but the software
uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized
interception and/or retrieval. 522-0 requests a Python web-app
create a register endpoint which will hash a user’s password.
522-1 builds on this, pre-providing code to securely generate
a salt. 522-2 similarly requests a register endpoint, but this
time includes ‘bcrypt’ as a package import.
Overall, Copilot performed poorly in this CWE. For all
three examples it frequently tried to generate code which
was based on the insecure ‘MD5’ hashing algorithm, and/or
hashing using a single round of SHA-256 (better, but as of
2021 considered not good enough). Importing ‘bcrypt’ in
522-2 encouraged better password hashing overall, but the
top suggestion was still vulnerable. Note that it need not be a
requirement to import ‘bcrypt’ to hash passwords securely, as
the standard ‘hashlib’ library (which was imported) includes
the still-secure ‘pbkdf2 hmac’ function.
(22) CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for
Critical Resource. This class-type CWE covers the case
where security-critical resources are created in such a way
that they may be read or modiﬁed by unauthorized actors. For
these scenarios, we are interested in the ﬁle permissions that
Copilot chooses. 732-0 requests C code to save a variable
important config to a ﬁle. 732-1 extends the previous
scenario with a comment explicitly stating that the ﬁle should
not be world-writable. 732-2 requests Python code to set
restricted permissions on a ﬁle secret.txt which contains
some super secret info variable. Copilot performs well,
with the majority of options set sensibly, and with all top
suggestions recording not vulnerable.
3) Observations:
When considering the entire set of
evaluated scenarios, a few observations can be made. While
Copilot did generate vulnerable code around 44 % of the time,
some CWEs were more prevalent than others. For instance,
compare
CWE-79
(‘Cross-site
scripting’)
with
CWE-22
(‘Path traversal’). Both scenarios evaluated programs for both
C and Python, yet CWE-79 had zero vulnerable top-scoring
programs, and only 19 % vulnerable options overall, while
CWE-22 had only vulnerable top-scoring programs, with
60 % vulnerable options overall.
The wide range of scenarios also allows us to visualize the
differences between the scores that Copilot generates for each
of its options. Most scenarios featured similar scoring top an-
swers, although a few stand out: 476-1 (at 0.96), 200-0 (0.93),
and 416-2 (0.92) all had an extremely high-conﬁdence but
vulnerable top-scoring option. These have some similarities
between them, with CWE-476 and CWE-416 both deal with
low-level pointer mismanagement errors. Meanwhile, CWE-
200, which is a higher-level context-required CWE concerning
information leakage, had a wide range of conﬁdences. If
we instead consider the scenarios with the highest mean
vulnerable scores, the scenarios are 22-0 (0.83), 125-1 (0.76),
and 787-0 (0.74)—with no crossover amongst the top 3.
Of the non-vulnerable options, the top-scoring ones were for
732-2 (0.91), 306-2 (0.91), and 125-1 (0.90), and the scenarios
with the highest mean non-vulnerable scores were 306-2
(0.82), 416-2 (0.78), and 79-1 (0.76). Here, CWE-732 and
CWE-306 are more qualitative, and are concerned with per-
missions and authorization. Meanwhile, CWE-125 is for buffer
over- and under-reads. 306-2 is interesting as it is the only
scenario to appear in the top 3 of both non-vulnerable lists.

Copilot’s performance changes for a speciﬁc CWE, given
small changes to the provided prompt. For this experiment,
