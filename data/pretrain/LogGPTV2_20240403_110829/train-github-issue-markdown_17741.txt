The following snippet is valid, as far as I know:
    export interface User {
        wpUserID: string;
    }
The following snippet is also valid, but does not compile, but probably
should:
    export default interface User {
        wpUserID: string;
    }
I get errors thrown at me when using TypeScript 1.5-beta:
    Error: /Models/User.ts(1,26): Error TS1005: ';' expected.
    Error: /Models/User.ts(1,31): Error TS1005: ';' expected.
