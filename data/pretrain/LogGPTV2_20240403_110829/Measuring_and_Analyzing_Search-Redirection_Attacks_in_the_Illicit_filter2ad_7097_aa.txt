## Abstract

This study investigates the manipulation of web search results to promote the unauthorized sale of prescription drugs. We focus on search-redirection attacks, where attackers compromise high-ranking websites and dynamically redirect traffic to different pharmacies based on the specific search terms issued by the consumer. Over a nine-month period in 2010-2011, we constructed a list of 218 drug-related queries and automatically gathered search results daily. Our findings indicate that approximately one-third of all search results are from over 7,000 infected hosts, which redirect to a few hundred pharmacy websites. Legitimate pharmacies and health resources have been largely overshadowed by search-redirection attacks and blog spam. Infections persist longest on high PageRank and .edu domains. Network analysis reveals that 96% of infected domains are interconnected through traffic redirection chains, with a few concentrated communities linking many otherwise disparate pharmacies. We estimate that the conversion rate of web searches into sales lies between 0.3% and 3%, and more illegal drug sales are facilitated by search-redirection attacks than by email spam. Finally, we observe that the concentration in both source infections and redirectors presents an opportunity for defenders to disrupt online pharmacy sales.

## 1. Introduction and Background

The illicit sale of prescription drugs on the internet is arguably one of the most dangerous forms of online criminal activity. While the resale of counterfeit luxury goods or software is clearly fraudulent, counterfeit medicines pose a significant threat to public safety. Independent testing has shown that these drugs often contain the active ingredient but in incorrect and potentially dangerous dosages [48].

In 2008, following the death of a teenager, the U.S. Congress passed the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act, making it illegal under federal law to "deliver, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance by means of the Internet" without an authorized prescription, or "to aid and abet such activity" [35]. Despite this, illicit sales have continued to thrive.

In response, the White House has recently helped form a group of registrars, technology companies, and payment processors to counter the proliferation of illicit online pharmacies [19]. For a long time, suspicious online retail operations primarily used email spam to advertise their products. However, the low conversion rates associated with email spam [22] have led miscreants to adopt new tactics. Search-engine manipulation [47], particularly through the use of compromised web servers, has become a widely used method to advertise products. This technique, known as search-redirection attacks, is the focus of our study.

### 1.1 Search-Redirection Attacks

Figure 1 illustrates a typical search-redirection attack. In response to the query "cialis without prescription," the top eight results include five .edu sites, one .com site with an unrelated domain name, and two online pharmacies. At first glance, the .edu and one of the .com sites appear unrelated to the sale of prescription drugs. However, clicking on some of these links, including the top search result, redirects the visitor to an online pharmacy store.

The attack works as follows: The attacker identifies high-visibility, vulnerable websites (e.g., outdated versions of WordPress [49], phpBB [38], or other blogging or wiki software). The injected code intercepts incoming HTTP requests and responds differently based on the request type. Requests from search-engine crawlers return a mix of the original content and numerous links to promoted websites. Requests from search results for relevant queries are redirected to a website chosen by the attacker. All other requests, including direct URIs, return the original content, making it difficult for website operators to detect the compromise.

### 1.2 Summary of Contributions

Our study contributes to the understanding of online crime and search engine manipulation in several ways:

1. **Data Collection:** We collected search results over a nine-month interval (April 2010â€“February 2011), gathering about 185,000 different URIs, of which around 63,000 were infected.
2. **Prevalence and Persistence:** A quarter of the top 10 search results actively redirect from compromised websites to online pharmacies at any given time. Infected websites are slowly remedied, with a median infection lasting 46 days, and 16% remaining infected throughout the study.
3. **Network Analysis:** We provide evidence of large, connected advertising networks, funneling traffic to over 90% of the illicit online pharmacies encountered.
4. **Other Activities:** We analyze whether sites involved in the pharmaceutical trade are involved in other forms of suspicious activities, such as serving malware-infested pages or spam email campaigns.
5. **Conversion Rates:** We estimate that the conversion rate of web searches into sales is between 0.3% and 3%, significantly higher than those observed for spam campaigns.
6. **Mitigation Strategies:** We consider various mitigation strategies to reduce the harm caused by search-redirection attacks.

## 2. Measurement Methodology

### 2.1 Infrastructure Overview

Our measurement infrastructure consists of two components: a search-engine agent and a crawler. The search-engine agent uses the Google Web Search API [2] to retrieve the top 64 search results for selected queries. Every 24 hours, the agent sends 218 different queries related to prescription drugs and stores all 13,952 URIs returned. The crawler then checks for HTTP 302 redirects, emulating typical web-search activity by setting appropriate User-Agent and Referrer terms. To circumvent blocking, all crawler requests are tunneled through the Tor network [11].

### 2.2 Query Selection

Selecting appropriate queries is critical for obtaining quality, coverage, and representativeness. We began with a seed query, "no prescription vicodin," and compiled a list of 48 unique queries representative of all drugs advertised.
