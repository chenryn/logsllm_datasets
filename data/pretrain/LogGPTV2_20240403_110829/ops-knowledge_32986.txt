For the automatic deployment of various types of server applications, such as web, socket, and daemon services, that utilize a wide range of technologies (e.g., different databases and programming languages), you have several options. Given that your team currently uses Python, Java, and Ruby, and may incorporate additional languages in the future, it's important to choose a solution that is flexible and can handle this diversity.

**Initial Solution:**
You mentioned that you initially used **Puppet** for managing all server setup, configurations, and deployments. To trigger the deployment of new versions, you utilized **Python Fabric** scripts. Puppet is a powerful tool for configuration management, and combining it with Fabric for deployment automation is a solid approach. However, if you are looking for alternatives or improvements, here are some suggestions:

**Recommended Solution:**
Consider using **KWateeSDCM (Software Deployment and Configuration Management)**. KWateeSDCM offers a user-friendly web-based graphical interface, making it easy to manage without requiring complex scripting. It integrates seamlessly with your build chain through a REST API, which simplifies the deployment process. This tool is particularly well-suited for environments that use a variety of technologies and languages, as it abstracts away much of the complexity involved in deploying and configuring different types of applications.

**Key Features of KWateeSDCM:**
- **User-Friendly Web GUI:** Simplifies the management of server setups and configurations.
- **No Complex Scripting Required:** Reduces the learning curve and maintenance overhead.
- **REST API Integration:** Facilitates smooth integration with your existing build and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of technologies and programming languages, making it a future-proof solution.

By adopting KWateeSDCM, you can streamline your deployment processes and ensure that your infrastructure remains robust and adaptable to future changes.
