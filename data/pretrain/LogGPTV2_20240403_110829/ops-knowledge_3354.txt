User:  How to ensure the security of web applications? Please provide some common web security technologies.
Assistant: 1. Input verification: Verify and filter all data received from users or other external systems to ensure its correctness and security. Including format, length, data type, special characters, etc. 2. Filtering and encryption: Before submitting input data, all illegal characters are filtered out to prevent malicious injection of malicious code and SQL injection attacks. When transferring data, use encryption protocols (such as HTTPS) to ensure the safe transmission of data. 3. User authentication and authorization: user identity authentication and authorization to ensure that users can only access their authorized resources and operations. It is usually implemented using technologies such as username and password authentication, multi-factor authentication, and session management. 4. Firewall: Use network firewall and application firewall to filter out invalid network requests and intrusions to prevent malicious intrusions. 5. Application layer vulnerability scanning: regularly conduct application vulnerability scanning to check whether there are potential security vulnerabilities and the results of vulnerability patching. Defend by means of vulnerability patching, upgrades, updates, etc. 6. Data backup and recovery: Ensure that data will not be lost or damaged, and regularly back up and store important data. At the same time, other technologies can be used to ensure data integrity and recovery, such as disk mirroring, real-time replication and other technologies. 7. Access log audit: Record all network access events and behaviors to provide evidence for security audits. In addition, abnormal activities can be monitored in real time to detect and prevent attacks in time. 8. Security supervision program: Establish a security supervision program to conduct security assessment, vulnerability scanning, vulnerability analysis, network monitoring and other operational management operations. Protect the security of web applications by going through the necessary security checks.
