User: There is an existing cloud-based database that has performance problems during high concurrent access. How to optimize the performance of the system?
Assistant: The optimization methods that may be used are as follows: 1. Analyze and optimize the database structure: redesign the table structure of the database, normalize the data, and reasonably set the data type of the field. 2. Enhance the configuration of the database server: optimize system configuration, increase memory, upgrade CPU, etc. to improve overall performance. 3. Optimize SQL statements: Try to avoid resource-consuming SQL statements such as JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, and NOT IN. 4. Query cache: Cache repeated queries to reduce the number of database queries. 5. Distributed deployment: realize load balancing and high availability through distributed architecture. 6. Data sharding: through data sharding, data is distributed and stored on multiple nodes to reduce the pressure on a single node and improve concurrent processing capabilities. 7. Caching mechanism: Use caching to reduce access to the database and improve response speed. 8. Asynchronous processing: Executing some time-consuming operations asynchronously can improve concurrent processing capabilities. 9. Horizontal expansion: expand system capacity by adding server nodes and improve concurrent processing capabilities. 10. Process data with high access frequency: such as preheating commonly used hot data, separating data with low access frequency, etc.
