Subject: Discrepancy in the Official TensorFlow Logo

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. My wife has noticed a discrepancy in the official TensorFlow logo, and I would like to bring it to your attention.

In the logo, the "T" consists of 4 columns, but the shadow only shows 3 columns. For reference, please see the attached image:

We believe that the shadow should also have 4 columns to maintain consistency and accuracy.

If you agree, we would be happy to assist with the correction. Additionally, we are open to any form of appreciation for our contribution, such as a small token or recognition.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
