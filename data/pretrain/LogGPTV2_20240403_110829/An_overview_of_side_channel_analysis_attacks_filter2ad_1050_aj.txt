Raphael Spreitzer is a researcher at Graz University
of Technology. His main research interests are infor-
mation security with a special focus on side-channel
attacks on mobile devices, e.g., cache attacks and
sensor-based attacks, and practical applications of
privacy-enhancing technologies. He obtained a PhD
degree in computer science with distinction from
Graz University of Technology in 2017. Before,
he ﬁnished the master’s programme Software En-
gineering and Management with distinction at Graz
University of Technology.
Veelasha Moonsamy is a postdoctoral researcher
in the Digital Security group at Radboud Univer-
sity in The Netherlands. She obtained her PhD
from Deakin University in Melbourne (Australia),
under the supervision of Prof. Lynn Batten. Her re-
search interests revolves around security and privacy
on mobile devices, in particular side- and covert-
channel attacks, malware detection and mitigation of
information leaks at application and hardware level.
Thomas Korak received his MSc (Dipl.-Ing.) in
Computer Engineering at Graz University of Tech-
nology in 2011 and his PhD in 2015. Until 2017 he
was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Ap-
plied Information Processing and Communications
(IAIK), Graz University of Technology. His main
research topics are side-channel attacks and fault
attacks targeting embedded devices. Next to that he
is also interested in countermeasures for hardening
devices against this kind of attacks.
Stefan Mangard is full professor at Graz Univer-
sity of Technology since November 2013. Before
moving to Graz, he was working as leading security
architect at Inﬁneon Technologies in Munich. In this
role he was responsible for deﬁning the security
concepts for all the smart card platforms of Inﬁneon,
one of the largest manufacturers of smart card ICs
worldwide. He is chair of the steering committee
of CHES, which is the foremost conference on
cryptographic hardware, and associate editor of the
Journal on Cryptographic Engineering. He regularly
serves on program committees of conferences in the ﬁeld (CHES, CARDIS,
COSADE...). In 2015, Stefan has received the highly prestigious ERC
consolidator grant by the European Research Council for his research proposal
“SOPHIA – Securing Software against Physical Attacks”.
