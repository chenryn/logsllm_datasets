### Who Am I and What Is This Talk About?
- **About Me:**
  - Penetration Tester with a background in Computer Science and Geophysics.
  - Holder of numerous certifications.
  - Experience in writing custom exploits for hotel software, two-way reservation fuzzing, and creating enclosures for Teensy 3.0 that resemble iPhones for penetration testing.
  - Developed an RFID scanner that can be mounted under a chair.
- **Experience:**
  - Over 9 years of real-world penetration testing, disaster recovery, and security research.
  - Conducted compliance audits for NERC, FFIEC, ISO, GLBA, FDIC, HIPAA, and Omnibus.
  - Wrote custom exploits and scripts for obscure internet service provider gear.
- **Tools of the Trade:**
  - "Fleet of Fake iPhones" for various security assessments.

### Key Topics:
- **Phone Call Bomber:**
  - Transforming a prepaid phone into a solar-powered hacker tool hidden in a public library light fixture.
  - Demonstration of 15 phones taking down a 200-person call center.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS):**
  - Definitions and differences.
  - How TDoS impacts businesses.
  - Alternative uses once a phone is flashed into an attack platform.

## Slide 2: Fleet of Fake iPhones with Teensy 3.0
- **RFID Badge Reader:**
  - Scans through seats where customers' wallets would be placed.

## Slide 3: DDoS and TDoS: What Are They and How Do They Differ?
- **DDoS Attack:**
  - An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.
  - Typically involves efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet.
- **TDoS Attack:**
  - A flood of unwanted, malicious inbound calls, usually targeting contact centers or other voice-service-dependent parts of an enterprise.

## Slide 4: Current Methods of TDoS
- **SIP Trunking:**
  - A VoIP and streaming media service based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
  - Used by ITSPs to deliver telephony services and unified communications to customers with SIP-based private branch exchanges (IP PBX) and Unified Communications facilities.
- **Primary Rate Interface (PRI):**
  - A standardized telecommunication service level within the ISDN specification.
  - Carries multiple DS0 voice and data transmissions between a network and a user, consisting of 24 channels, one for Data Caller ID information.

## Slide 5: TDoS in the Wild
- **Common Techniques:**
  - Caller ID spoofing and reflection attacks.
  - Malware on phones and call management software.
  - Scripts to load caller information onto realtor web pages.
  - Hijacked PRI and SIP services, war dialing.
- **Caller ID Reflection Attack:**
  - Legitimate phone service with spoofed Caller ID information.
  - Thousands of calls returned to the number that they believe called them.
  - Real estate pages using similar scripts for inquiry generation.

## Slide 6: Web Scripts and Bots
- **76% of Realtor Web Pages:**
  - Use the same scripts without captchas.
  - Script posts to over 4,600 realtor pages in 2 hours.
- **Botnets of Infected Smartphones:**
  - Smartphones have become platforms for botnets.
  - Increase in "rooted" phones opens doors to security risks.

## Slide 7: Development of an OEM/Weaponized Cellphone Platform
- **Prepaid Cell Phones:**
  - Running Brew 3.1 Operating System.
  - CDMA 1X 800/1900 MHz Digital Only Samsung U365 (Gusto 2).
  - Qsc6055 192 MHz processor.
- **Features:**
  - Works on all value-tier Qualcomm QSC60XX.
  - Developer editions support bootloader unlocking, allowing installation of custom kernels and system images.
  - Consumer editions ship with locked bootloaders, but this can now be bypassed.
- **Security Features:**
  - Secure Boot, SEE, SFS.
  - No application processor, making security easy to bypass.

## Slide 8: Exploits and Modifications
- **Exploit in IRingerMgr:**
  - Allows interaction with clam and speaker manipulations, such as picking up a call instead of playing a ringtone.
- **Clam-Type Phones:**
  - Devices with parts that can be folded or rotated to cover the main LCD or keypad.
  - Applications may need to alter their functional use of hardware or services based on user actions.
- **Secondary Display:**
  - For devices supporting a secondary display, the display is available to applications requiring display services when the clam is closed.
- **Modified Executable:**
  - Allows pushing software to the device, bypassing security features using loopholes in the certificate expiration process.
  - Exploited by running modified executables while the device is installed with a valid signed driver.
  - Once the driver is updated on the PC, it allows full attack surface support.

## Slide 9: PRL and GPS Manipulation
- **PRL (Preferred Roaming List):**
  - Pulled from device activity, allowing setting of jump times and turning off or locking GPS position, making the device practically untraceable.
- **Development Platform:**
  - Emulate the software on custom-written platform emulators provided for OEM developers.
  - Full platform for emulation of the U365 device, allowing testing of applications without loading them on the device.

## Slide 10: Weaponized Development Platform
- **Full Control:**
  - With the attack platform loaded on the phone, you have full control over all devices, including TDoS, brick mode, etc.
  - Setting ringtones as specific payloads.
  - Triggering malformed ringtones processes on events that trigger them.

## Slide 11: CheeseBox? History and Evolution
- **Call Proxy:**
  - Calls one phone number, which is passed via Bluetooth to a second phone, calling your real number, making it untraceable.
- **Bluetooth-Connected Weaponized Phone:**
  - Calls three times in a row and records the third call straight to voicemail as an MP3 on the desktop.
  - Files created with Bluetooth connection, output as S2 text files.
  - Run MP3 through speech-to-text open-source software.
  - No need to call into the program; the script will call in and use input information from the list below.

## Slide 12: Prepaid Cell Phone Capabilities
- **Anonymous Purchase:**
  - $2 per day usage.
  - Untraceable and can be charged with a solar USB charger.
  - PRL list hopping and non-recoverable GPS unless in 911 mode, which can be easily turned off.
- **Kit Cost:**
  - Prepaid phone: $16.
  - Solar USB charger: $5.
  - Total: $21.
- **Stable Non-Stop Calling:**
  - Continuous calling for 5 days.
  - Alarm sets phone to brick on the 5th day with a malformed ringtone.

## Slide 13: Turning a Phone into a Call Bomber
- **Process:**
  - Plugged into a computer to update firmware and PRL.
  - Plugged into a laptop and reflashed in under 8 minutes.
  - Crashing call software by TDoS.
  - Launching 10 phones with the weaponized platform.
  - CPU and RAM utilization crashes the call center VM.
