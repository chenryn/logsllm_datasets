The code passes all tests, but no message displays confirming that the bonfire
is completed/the bonfire is not checked off on the map. Screenshots attached
of both the Sum of All Odd Fibonacci Numbers and the Binary Agents bonfire
with the same issue. Only present on some bonfires, others are working fine.
Happening on both OSX and Linux Mint operating systems using Firefox
