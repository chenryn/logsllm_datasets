_I previously posted this problem on Stackoverflow but got no responses.
However I decided to post it here as well as it's only a problem with FBX
models and not OBJ models, which makes it look like some kind of bug._
I am loading FBX models for my project. I Want to create multiple objects of
the same FBX model but loading each separately is very inefficient so I would
like to save one loaded model and clone it. This concept is working with the
.OBJ format.
Everything works as expected but then I use "model.clone();" nothing really
happens.  
The model is no longer visible but I get no errors. If you compare the cloned
model with the original they look exactly the same so I don't know why it's
not showing up.
The part of the code where you can compare the two is:  
"var sendModel = model;//Works  
//var sendModel = model.clone();//Doesn't works"  
Starting at line 30.
Here is some simplified working source code:
