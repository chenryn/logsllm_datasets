Abstract—Wireless radio channels are known to contain infor-
mation about the surrounding propagation environment, which
can be extracted using established wireless sensing methods.
Thus, today’s ubiquitous wireless devices are attractive targets
for passive eavesdroppers to launch reconnaissance attacks.
In particular, by overhearing standard communication signals,
eavesdroppers obtain estimations of wireless channels which
can give away sensitive information about indoor environments.
For instance, by applying simple statistical methods, adversaries
can infer human motion from wireless channel observations,
allowing to remotely monitor premises of victims. In this work,
building on the advent of intelligent reﬂecting surfaces (IRSs), we
propose IRShield as a novel countermeasure against adversarial
wireless sensing. IRShield is designed as a plug-and-play privacy-
preserving extension to existing wireless networks. At the core of
IRShield, we design an IRS conﬁguration algorithm to obfuscate
wireless channels. We validate the effectiveness with extensive
experimental evaluations. In a state-of-the-art human motion de-
tection attack using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices, IRShield lowered
detection rates to 5 % or less.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless connectivity drives many current digital innova-
tions and is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. This trend man-
ifests itself in a worldwide surge in the adoption of Internet of
Things (IoT) devices with 75 billion connected devices pro-
jected by 2025 [24]. The IoT phenomenon is already heavily
present in our daily lives: voice assistants, watches, locks, light
bulbs, cameras, vacuum cleaners, sensors, and actuators have
turned into devices that we consider smart. However, virtually
all of them rely on wireless connectivity, based on standards
such as Wi-Fi, BLE, NB-IoT, or ZigBee [20].
A downside of having ubiquitous wireless communication
is the burgeoning of new types of privacy concerns. Since
wireless communication is based on an open medium, it is
inherently shared with third, potentially adversarial, parties.
Although cryptographic primitives are widely used for provid-
ing conﬁdentiality and integrity of the application data, passive
eavesdroppers are still able to exploit sensitive information
from sniffed radio frequency (RF) signals. This is possible
as the propagation of RF signals depends on the physical
surroundings of devices, e. g., due to reﬂections off walls,
objects, and individuals. Eavesdroppers can remotely observe
such propagation effects to gather insights about the physical
environment of a legitimate transmitter, referred to as (adver-
sarial) wireless sensing. As already demonstrated by existing
work in the literature, this leads to an immediate privacy
threat due to reconnaissance attacks, such as adversarial human
motion sensing.
Zhu et al. [37] demonstrated the feasibility of carrying
out ﬁne-grained detection and tracking of human movements
inside a building by only snifﬁng ordinary Wi-Fi signals.
Their low-cost attack makes use of the Wi-Fi signal dynamics
and variance of multipath signal propagation to track indoor
movements without requiring any a priori knowledge on
the adversary’s side. Similarly, Banerjee et al. [6] proposed
a methodology to detect human motion within the line-of-
sight (LOS), i. e., the direct path between the victim’s device
and that of the passive sniffer. Generally, there is signiﬁcant
potential for (adversarial) wireless sensing on the physical
layer, as highlighted by the large corpus of existing work
surveyed by Ma et al. [19]. Besides exploiting physical-
layer properties, an adversary can also monitor packet-level
information to infer the state of IoT devices and actions carried
out by users present in the network, cf. [3], [26], [35].
While inference attacks from packet-level wireless snifﬁng
may be thwarted by means of phantom users [17], a versatile
and easy to use countermeasure against wireless sensing on
the physical layer is still lacking. One prominent approach
was put forward by Qiao et al. who proposed PhyCloak [22].
By using a full-duplex radio, ambient wireless signals are
re-transmitted with randomized modiﬁcations to obfuscate
sensitive physical information. However, full-duplex is costly
as it requires specialized and complex radio hardware. While
eliminating the use of full-duplex equipment, the proposal by
Yao et al. [33] requires several motorized moving hardware
parts. Jiao et al. [12] proposed modifying software-deﬁned
wireless transmitters. Other approaches by Zhu et al. [37] and
Wijewardena et al. [29] affect the allocation of the channel.
Therefore, they not only trade the quality of service of wireless
communication against adversarial sensing capabilities, but
also require integration with the wireless devices in the ﬁeld.
In this paper, we aim to design a countermeasure against
adversarial wireless sensing on the physical layer that over-
comes the shortcomings of previous approaches and resolves

the following challenges (C1–C3):
• Device-agnostic countermeasure (C1): There exists a
wide variety of wireless devices that are present in the
real-world and cannot be remotely updated or modiﬁed.
Thus, we pursue a solution independent of deployed
devices, the used wireless waveforms, and standards.
• Maintain quality of service (C2): The connectivity
requirements of wireless applications are diverse and
hard to predict, which renders a reduction in quality of
service unacceptable. An effective countermeasure should
therefore not affect the quality of the wireless link.
Inspired by a recent trend from the realm of wireless com-
munication, we explore smart radio environments with intelli-
gent reﬂecting surfaces (IRSs) to overcome these hurdles. To
date, digitally controlled IRS are primarily used as adjustable
elements in propagation environments, which improve wireless
communication [23]. A key aspect of the IRS is that it directly
affects the adversary’s observation used for privacy-violation
attacks: the wireless channel. Therefore, we propose IRShield
– a practical IRS-based wireless channel obfuscation. It greatly
reduces adversarial capabilities for privacy violations from
wireless sensing. Speciﬁc to the IRS, we address the third
challenge:
• Surface conﬁguration (C3): In a communication con-
text, IRS are conﬁgured based on channel information
from legitimate receivers and careful integration into the
wireless infrastructure [30]. However, in an adversarial
wireless sensing scenario, the receiver (eavesdropper) is
unknown and hostile, and therefore the required channel
information is not available. The challenge is thus to
provide strong channel obfuscation, given the extremely
large IRS conﬁguration space of, e. g., 2256.

A. Wireless Sensing Methods
When wireless radio signals traverse from a transmitter to
a receiver, they are distorted by the channel response which
aggregates environment-dependent effects on the signal such
as multipath propagation. In particular, the channel response
between an arbitrary transmitter and receiver is determined
by different propagation paths through the environment, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. These are LOS paths and various non-
LOS (NLOS) paths, e. g., from reﬂections off walls, interior
objects, or individuals. Particular to the case of human motion,
new paths are created and existing paths are blocked, thus
making the wireless signal propagation time-variant. At time
t, we assume that the propagation paths Lt are present.
In a wireless communication context, the (undesired) chan-
nel response is regularly estimated from known preamble
sequences to be compensated subsequently from the received
signal. This, likewise, happens for every received packet when
considering IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi communication based on
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM
divides a wide bandwidth wireless channel into K parallel
independent (i. e., orthogonal) narrowband channels, i. e., sub-
carriers, for data transmission. Upon detection of a packet, a
Wi-Fi receiver estimates the channel response (also referred
to as channel state information (CSI)) for each subcarrier k
IRShield addresses C3 through a probabilistic surface con-
ﬁguration strategy speciﬁcally designed to achieve channel
obfuscation as a standalone application. Further, IRShield
affects the bare radio wave propagation, regardless of speciﬁc
devices or waveforms, thus meeting the criteria for addressing
C1. Finally, IRShield does not allocate the wireless channel
itself but affects it randomly, hence solving C2.
Contribution. We are the ﬁrst to propose IRS to be used as a
hands-on countermeasure against unauthorized wireless sens-
ing. We design a dedicated algorithm to generate randomized
IRS conﬁgurations to achieve wireless channel obfuscation.
