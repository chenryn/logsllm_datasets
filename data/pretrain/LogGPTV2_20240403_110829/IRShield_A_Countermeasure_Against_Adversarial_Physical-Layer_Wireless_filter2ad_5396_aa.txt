## Abstract
Wireless radio channels contain information about the surrounding environment, which can be extracted using established wireless sensing methods. This makes ubiquitous wireless devices attractive targets for passive eavesdroppers to launch reconnaissance attacks. By overhearing standard communication signals, eavesdroppers can estimate wireless channels and infer sensitive information, such as human motion, from these observations. In this work, we propose IRShield, a novel countermeasure against adversarial wireless sensing, leveraging intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). IRShield is designed as a plug-and-play privacy-preserving extension to existing wireless networks. At its core, IRShield uses an IRS configuration algorithm to obfuscate wireless channels. We validate the effectiveness of IRShield with extensive experimental evaluations, demonstrating that it can lower detection rates in state-of-the-art human motion detection attacks to 5% or less.

## 1. Introduction
Wireless connectivity is driving many current digital innovations and is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. This trend is evident in the worldwide surge in the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with 75 billion connected devices projected by 2025 [24]. IoT devices, such as voice assistants, watches, locks, light bulbs, cameras, vacuum cleaners, sensors, and actuators, have become integral to our daily lives. However, virtually all of these devices rely on wireless connectivity based on standards like Wi-Fi, BLE, NB-IoT, or ZigBee [20].

While ubiquitous wireless communication offers numerous benefits, it also raises new privacy concerns. Since wireless communication is based on an open medium, it is inherently shared with third parties, potentially including adversaries. Although cryptographic primitives are widely used to provide confidentiality and integrity of application data, passive eavesdroppers can still exploit sensitive information from sniffed radio frequency (RF) signals. This is possible because the propagation of RF signals depends on the physical surroundings, such as reflections off walls, objects, and individuals. Eavesdroppers can remotely observe these propagation effects to gather insights about the physical environment of a legitimate transmitter, a practice known as adversarial wireless sensing. This leads to significant privacy threats, such as the ability to detect and track human movements.

For example, Zhu et al. [37] demonstrated the feasibility of fine-grained detection and tracking of human movements inside a building by only sniffing ordinary Wi-Fi signals. Their low-cost attack leverages the dynamics and variance of multipath signal propagation to track indoor movements without requiring any prior knowledge. Similarly, Banerjee et al. [6] proposed a methodology to detect human motion within the line-of-sight (LOS) between the victim's device and the passive sniffer. The potential for adversarial wireless sensing on the physical layer is significant, as highlighted by the extensive body of existing work surveyed by Ma et al. [19]. Besides exploiting physical-layer properties, adversaries can also monitor packet-level information to infer the state of IoT devices and actions carried out by users present in the network, as discussed in [3], [26], and [35].

While inference attacks from packet-level wireless sniffing may be thwarted by means of phantom users [17], a versatile and easy-to-use countermeasure against wireless sensing on the physical layer is still lacking. One prominent approach was proposed by Qiao et al. [22], who introduced PhyCloak. This method uses a full-duplex radio to re-transmit ambient wireless signals with randomized modifications to obfuscate sensitive physical information. However, full-duplex is costly and requires specialized and complex radio hardware. Other proposals, such as those by Yao et al. [33] and Jiao et al. [12], require motorized moving hardware parts or modifications to software-defined wireless transmitters. Approaches by Zhu et al. [37] and Wijewardena et al. [29] affect the allocation of the channel, trading the quality of service of wireless communication against adversarial sensing capabilities and requiring integration with the wireless devices in the field.

In this paper, we aim to design a countermeasure against adversarial wireless sensing on the physical layer that overcomes the shortcomings of previous approaches and resolves the following challenges (C1–C3):

- **Device-agnostic countermeasure (C1):** There is a wide variety of wireless devices in the real world that cannot be remotely updated or modified. Therefore, we pursue a solution independent of deployed devices, used wireless waveforms, and standards.
- **Maintain quality of service (C2):** The connectivity requirements of wireless applications are diverse and hard to predict, making a reduction in quality of service unacceptable. An effective countermeasure should not affect the quality of the wireless link.
- **Surface configuration (C3):** In a communication context, IRSs are configured based on channel information from legitimate receivers and careful integration into the wireless infrastructure. However, in an adversarial wireless sensing scenario, the receiver (eavesdropper) is unknown and hostile, and the required channel information is not available. The challenge is to provide strong channel obfuscation given the extremely large IRS configuration space, e.g., \(2^{256}\).

Inspired by recent trends in wireless communication, we explore smart radio environments with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to overcome these hurdles. To date, digitally controlled IRSs are primarily used as adjustable elements in propagation environments to improve wireless communication [23]. A key aspect of IRSs is that they directly affect the adversary’s observation used for privacy-violation attacks: the wireless channel. Therefore, we propose IRShield, a practical IRS-based wireless channel obfuscation method that greatly reduces adversarial capabilities for privacy violations from wireless sensing.

### 1.1. Wireless Sensing Methods
When wireless radio signals traverse from a transmitter to a receiver, they are distorted by the channel response, which aggregates environment-dependent effects on the signal, such as multipath propagation. The channel response between an arbitrary transmitter and receiver is determined by different propagation paths through the environment, including LOS paths and various non-LOS (NLOS) paths, e.g., from reflections off walls, interior objects, or individuals. In the case of human motion, new paths are created, and existing paths are blocked, making the wireless signal propagation time-variant. At time \(t\), we assume that the propagation paths \(L_t\) are present.

In a wireless communication context, the (undesired) channel response is regularly estimated from known preamble sequences to be compensated subsequently from the received signal. This happens for every received packet in IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi communication based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM divides a wide bandwidth wireless channel into \(K\) parallel independent (i.e., orthogonal) narrowband channels, i.e., subcarriers, for data transmission. Upon detecting a packet, a Wi-Fi receiver estimates the channel response (also referred to as channel state information (CSI)) for each subcarrier \(k\).

IRShield addresses C3 through a probabilistic surface configuration strategy specifically designed to achieve channel obfuscation as a standalone application. Further, IRShield affects the bare radio wave propagation, regardless of specific devices or waveforms, thus meeting the criteria for addressing C1. Finally, IRShield does not allocate the wireless channel itself but affects it randomly, hence solving C2.

### Contribution
We are the first to propose IRSs as a hands-on countermeasure against unauthorized wireless sensing. We design a dedicated algorithm to generate randomized IRS configurations to achieve wireless channel obfuscation.
