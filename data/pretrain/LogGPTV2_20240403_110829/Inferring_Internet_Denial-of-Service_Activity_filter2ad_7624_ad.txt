Figure 8: Distribution of attacks to Autonomous Systems
(ASes) that were targeted by at least 1% of all attacks.
Figure 9: Histogram counting the number of victims of re-
peated attacks across all traces.
with the victim of an attack, we performed longest pre-
ﬁx matching against a BGP routing table using the vic-
tim’s IP address. To construct this table, we took a snap-
shot from a border router with global routes on February
7, 2001. We then mapped AS numbers to identifying
names using the NetGeo [17] service to do lookups in
registry whois servers. We labeled addresses which had
no matching preﬁx as ”NOROUTE”.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of attacks to the 17
ASes that were targeted by at least 1% of all attacks. As
with top-level domains, each AS named on the x-axis is
associated with three values, one for each of the three
weeks of our study in progressive shades of grey. Note
that the ASes are sorted by overall attacks across all three
weeks.
From Figure 8, we see that no single AS or small set
of ASes is the target of an overwhelming fraction of at-
tacks: STARNETS was attacked the most, but only re-
ceived 4-5% of attacks. However, the distribution of
ASes attacked does have a long tail. The ASes shown
in Figure 8 accounted for 35% of all attacks, yet these
ASes correspond to only 3% of all ASes attacked. About
4% of attacks each week had no route according to our
ofﬂine snapshot of global routes.
Compared with TLDs, ASes experienced more varia-
tion in the number of attacks targeted at them for each
week. In other words, there is more stability in the type
or country of victims than the ASes in which they re-
side. For example, EMBRATEL’s percentage of attacks
varies by more than a factor of 2, and AS 15662, an un-
named AS in Yugoslavia, did not show up in week 1 of
the traces.
6.3.4 Victims of repeated attacks
Figure 9 shows a histogram of victims of repeated at-
tacks for all traces combined. The values on the x-axis
correspond to the number of attacks to the same victim in
the trace period, and the values on the y-axis show what
percentage of victims were attacked a given number of
times in logarithmic scale. For example, the majority of
victims (65%) were attacked only once, and many of the
remaining victims (18%) were attacked twice. Overall,
most victims (95%) were attacked ﬁve or fewer times.
For the remaining victims, most were attacked less than
a dozen times, although a handful of hosts were attacked
quite often. In the trace period, one host was attacked 48
times for durations between 72 seconds and 5 hours (at
times simultaneously). The graph is also truncated: there
are 5 outlier victims attacked 60–70 times, and one un-
fortunate victim attacked 102 times in a one week span.
6.4 Validation
The backscatter hypothesis states that unsolicited packets
represent responses to spoofed attack trafﬁc. This theory,
which is at the core of our approach, is difﬁcult to vali-
date beyond all doubt. However, we can increase our
conﬁdence signiﬁcantly through careful examination of
the data and via related experiments.
First, an important observation from Table 3 is that
roughly 80% of attacks and 98% of packets are attributed
to backscatter that does not itself provoke a response (e.g.
TCP RST, ICMP Host Unreachable). Consequently,
these packets could not have been used for probing our
monitored network; therefore network probing is not a
good alternative explanation for this trafﬁc.
Next, we were able to duplicate a portion of our anal-
ysis using data provided by Vern Paxson taken from sev-
eral University-related networks in Northern California.
This new dataset covers the same period, but only detects
TCP backscatter with the SYN and ACK ﬂags set. The
address space monitored was also much smaller, consist-
ing of three /16 networks (
space). For 98% of the victim IP addresses recorded in
this smaller dataset, we ﬁnd a corresponding record at
the same time in our larger dataset. We can think of no
other mechanism other than backscatter that can explain
such a close level of correspondence.

Finally, Asta Networks provided us with data describ-
ing denial-of-service attacks directly detected at mon-
itors covering a large backbone network. While their
approach and ours capture different sets of attacks (in
part due ingress ﬁltering as discussed in Section 3 and
in part due to limited peering in the monitored network),
their data qualitatively conﬁrms our own; in particular
we were able to match several attacks they directly ob-
served with contemporaneous records in our backscatter
database.
7 Related work
While denial-of-service has long been recognized as a
problem [14, 18], there has been limited research on
the topic. Most of the existing work can be roughly
categorized as being focused on tolerance, diagnosis
and localization. The ﬁrst category is composed of
both approaches for mitigating the impact of speciﬁc at-
tacks [4, 16] and general system mechanisms [25, 1] for
controlling resource usage on the victim machine. Usu-
ally such solutions involve a quick triage on data packets
so minimal work is spent on the attacker’s requests and
the victim can tolerate more potent attacks before failing.
These solutions, as embodied in operating systems, ﬁre-
walls, switches and routers, represent the dominant cur-
rent industrial solution for addressing denial-of-service
attacks.
The second area of research, akin to traditional intru-
sion detection, is about techniques and algorithms for
automatically detecting attacks as they occur [22, 13].
These techniques generally involve monitoring links in-
cident to the victim and analyzing patterns in the arriv-
ing and departing trafﬁc to determine if an attack has oc-
curred.
The ﬁnal category of work, focuses on identifying the
source(s) of DoS attacks in the presence of IP spooﬁng.
The best known and most widely deployed of these pro-
posals is so-called ingress and egress ﬁltering [12, 5].
These techniques, which differ mainly in whether they
are manually or automatically conﬁgured, cause routers
to drop packets with source addresses that are not used by
the customer connected to the receiving interface. Given
the practical difﬁculty of ensuring that all networks are
ﬁltered, other work has focused on developing tools and
mechanisms for tracing ﬂows of packets through the net-
work independent of their ostensibly claimed source ad-
dress [3, 26, 23, 2, 24, 11].
There is a dearth of research concerned with quantify-
ing attacks within the Internet – denial-of-service or oth-
erwise. Probably the best known prior work is Howard’s
PhD thesis – a longitudinal study of incident reports
received by the Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) from 1989 to 1995 [15]. Since then, CERT has
started a new project, called AIR-CERT, to automate the
collection of intrusion detection data from a number of
different organizations, but unfortunately their results are
not yet available [7]. To our knowledge ours is the only
quantitative and empirical study of wide-area denial-of-
service attacks to date.
8 Conclusions
In this paper we have presented a new technique,
“backscatter analysis,” for estimating denial-of-service
attack activity in the Internet. Using this technique, we
have observed widespread DoS attacks in the Internet,
distributed among many different domains and ISPs. The
size and length of the attacks we observe are heavy-
tailed, with a small number of long attacks constituting a
signiﬁcant fraction of the overall attack volume. More-
over, we see a surprising number of attacks directed at
