Question: Consider the following Objective-C code snippet used in a mobile application:

objective-c
import <dlfcn.h>
void *handle = dlopen("/path/to/library", RTLD_LAZY);


This code dynamically loads a shared library at runtime. Which of the following is NOT a security risk associated with this practice?
"A": "The application might inadvertently load a malicious library if the path is not properly secured.",
"B": "Using dynamic linking can optimize the application's performance by loading libraries as needed.",
"C": "Dynamic loading of libraries can lead to unauthorized access to application memory space.",
"D": "If the library's path is hard-coded, it might be exploited to execute arbitrary code."
Answer: B
