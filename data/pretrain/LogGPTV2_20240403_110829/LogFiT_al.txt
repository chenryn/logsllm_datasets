of 	randomly 	selecting 	tokens 	from 	the 	log 	paragraph.
Subsequently, the LogFiT model is tasked with predicting whatthe masked tokens were. If the top-k prediction accuracy for
a log paragraph is below some threshold, the log paragraph
is considered an anomaly. Otherwise the log paragraph is
considered normal. For the specific example shown in figure 5,
k=12 and the top-k accuracy threshold is 0.9. For illustration,
