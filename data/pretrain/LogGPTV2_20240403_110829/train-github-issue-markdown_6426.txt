To reproduce the issue, please follow these steps:

1. Visit [this JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/Q9K8L/).
2. Click on a radio button option twice.
3. Click the submit button.

You will notice that the selected radio button option is not included in the form submission.

I suspect that the `data-toggle="buttons"` data attribute may be causing this problem. This issue has been tested and confirmed on the following browsers:
- Google Chrome, Version 31.0.1650.57 m
- Mozilla Firefox, Version 24.0

Please let me know if you need further information or assistance.
