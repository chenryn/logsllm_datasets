ABSTRACT
The smart grid introduces concerns for the loss of consumer pri-
vacy; recently deployed smart meters retain and distribute highly
accurate proﬁles of home energy use. These proﬁles can be mined
by Non Intrusive Load Monitors (NILMs) to expose much of the
human activity within the served site. This paper introduces a new
class of algorithms and systems, called Non-Intrusive Load Lev-
eling (NILL) to combat potential invasions of privacy. NILL uses
an in-residence battery to mask variance in load on the grid, thus
eliminating exposure of the appliance-driven information used to
compromise consumer privacy. We use real residential energy use
proﬁles to drive four simulated deployments of NILL. The simula-
tions show that NILL exposes only 1.1 to 5.9 useful energy events
per day hidden amongst hundreds or thousands of similar battery-
suppressed events. Thus, the energy proﬁles exhibited by NILL are
largely useless for current NILM algorithms. Surprisingly, such
privacy gains can be achieved using battery systems whose storage
capacity is far lower than the residence’s aggregate load average.
We conclude by discussing how the costs of NILL can be offset by
energy savings under tiered energy schedules.

greener energy generation, less loss in energy storage and transmis-
sion, better fault isolation and recovery, and support for alternative
energy sources, e.g., consumer generated wind and solar energy.
The move to digital grid control systems also introduces con-
cerns about security [19, 24, 27]. The smart grid is a complex
system of sensors, networks, and computing resources. Attacks
against the smart-grid networks and computing elements can range
from fraud, to denial of service, to privacy loss [27]. While some
regulatory agencies have begun to explore security concerns, no
comprehensive system has emerged to address these threats.
One area of particular concern is the loss of consumer privacy.
Replacements for the antiquated in-home electromechanical me-
ters, smart meters are embedded systems that use power and volt-
age sensors to collect and report load proﬁles. Load proﬁles are
histories of energy usage collected at a conﬁgured granularity, e.g.,
seconds or minutes. While instrumental to managing energy use
at the local and regional levels, such proﬁles are also sufﬁcient to
determine occupant behavior in residential settings [22, 21, 11].
Depicted here, this behavioral inference is made possible by a class
of algorithms known as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM):
To simplify, NILM algorithms decompose load proﬁles into com-
posite appliance proﬁles based on known or learned signatures. For
example, traces of discrete changes in energy use can be mapped
directly to ON/OFF events associated with identiﬁable appliances.
The proﬁle is a detailed description of appliance use and indirectly
a surprisingly accurate model of human activity [22].
The concerns surrounding potential invasions of privacy via en-
ergy proﬁles appear to be more than hypothetical [15, 6]. Reuse
of data by direct marketers, criminals, or law enforcement with-
out prior approval or notiﬁcation is often in conﬂict with privacy
regulations, but may be occurring anyway [22]. Undercutting ex-
isting regulatory structures is a maze of often conﬂicting laws and
court decisions relating to consumer privacy. For example, the 1939
Supreme Court United State v. Miller decision indicates that there
is no reasonable expectation of privacy for information shared with
third parties. State and regional agencies have built legal and reg-
ulatory structures to buttress privacy in the face of such decisions,
but consumer rights remain, at best, murky.
The potential exposure of living conditions, occupancy, and fam-
ily routines, through energy proﬁles warrants vigilance [15]. This
prompts the goal of this work: we aim to protect consumer privacy

simulation of such a system under substantial real-word data. The
NILL approach presented here attempts to provide privacy for all
appliances under all battery states. Our analysis also extends be-
yond previous results by examining NILL’s effect on the basic unit
of load monitoring, the feature pair, and by measuring the amount
of privacy afforded over time due to changes in battery states.
The remainder of this paper identiﬁes and evaluates a candidate
NILL algorithm. A simulation of NILL is built on the widely-used
SimPowerSystems [26] platform. We simulate four homes using
energy proﬁle data collected from real residential use. These exper-
iments show that NILL exposed 1.1 and 5.9 identiﬁable appliance
events per day. Such features reside amongst hundreds or thou-
sands of battery-suppressed events, making reliable recovery of ap-
pliance proﬁles virtually impossible under current NILM. Further,
we showed that such privacy can be achieved in the tested environ-
ments using only a moderately priced 50 amp-hour battery system–
far smaller than the aggregate loads of protected residences.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Load Proﬁles
Conventional electromechanical watt-hour meters do not record
instantaneous demand, only net energy consumed over time. Thus,
they act as memoryless accumulators whose readouts are physically
spinning dials. Energy use is measured by computing dial position
changes since the last reading (typically by a human meter reader
In contrast, smart meters generate load proﬁles,
once a month).
time series of electric demand, that are delivered to the provider
at or near real time. The level of detail in load proﬁles is useful
for load forecasting and fraud detection [23]. Common low cost
meters measure epochs at 15 minutes, but more sophisticated mod-
els can generate proﬁles at a second or lower granularity. Table 1
summarizes the capabilities of several market-leading meters with
different capabilities.2
The three-day load proﬁle for a large 5-bedroom home is shown
in Figure 2. A diurnal pattern is observable: peaks are felt in the
morning, mid-day, and evening. The drop-out box shows an event
occurring about 7pm on the 18th. A plasma television connected
to a home theater system was turned on and then off about 5 sec-
onds later using a master switch. The initial large spike represents
the power-hungry television, followed by the theater receiver and
speaker system powering on. The OFF event shows a symmet-
ric decrease in power draw. NILM algorithms match these sister
features (ON/OFF features of equal amplitude) against known ap-
pliance proﬁles to uncover in-residence behavior.
2.2 Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring
NILM algorithms extract appliance proﬁles from load proﬁles.
It is considered “non-intrusive” because it does this at the elec-
tric meter without instrumenting individual appliances. An appli-

in the face of proﬁle-exposing smart meters while acknowledging
two practical constraints of the current grid environment:
• Energy usage must always be accurately reported. Any mod-
iﬁcation of usage data would undermine grid management,
and introduce inaccuracies in billing and grid controls.
• The privacy solution must not require any modiﬁcation to the
meters, appliances, grid control systems, or provider opera-
tion. The metering infrastructure, which is not under the con-
trol of the consumer, is assumed to be untrusted. Moreover,
with millions of smart meters already installed and many
more in deployment,1 any solution requiring new grid sys-
tems will not be logistically and economically viable [27].
We address threats to electricity consumer privacy through Non-
Intrusive Load Leveling (NILL), a novel technique to mask appli-
ance features in a home’s net load. Illustrated in Figure 1, NILL
is conceptually simple; a consumer places a battery and control
system between the smart meter and the circuit breaker of their
residence. The load observed by the meter is smoothed by offset-
ting spikes and dips in usage by charging or discharging the bat-
tery. Hence, NILL removes the information content that reveals
appliance usage. Because we make no assumptions about adver-
sary motivations, NILL aims to smooth all appliance features in a
house. However, because of the physical limits and structure of
electrical systems, this is a more challenging task than one might
initially surmise. Note that NILL is currently not designed to mask
longer term energy usage such as day/night diurnal energy patterns,
but only the instantaneous energy transitions that expose minute-to-
minute human behavior exploited by NILM algorithms. However,
we do explore the challenges and countermeasures posed by cur-
rently undeveloped NILM techniques that use more sophisticated
learning and inference techniques in Appendix A.
NILL is an algorithm and control system that attempts to remove
the ﬁne-grained appliance signal represented by changes in the re-
ported load. The control system directs the battery charges and
discharges to obscure energy usage. This is conceptually similar to
queue delay perturbation countermeasures that prevent networking
timing analysis [5]. By de-correlating both the timing and ampli-
tude of ON/OFF events in the load proﬁle, we remove the signal
that NILM algorithms use to identify behavior.
The idea of using a battery to provide “best effort” privacy pro-
tection is not new. For example, one short paper [16] has suggested
the use of a power router to allow a battery to offset appliance loads,
though the existing technology in this area limits the battery to han-
dling one appliance at a time. Furthermore, none of the physical
challenges of introducing a battery into a residential setting were
evaluated. Ours is the ﬁrst work to perform a rigorous physical

age. To avoid sulfation (inability to hold charge due to crystalliza-
tion of the lead sulfate), deep cycle batteries should not be allowed
to discharge below 20% of their total capacity, and staying above
50% is optimal. When a battery is to be charged beyond 90%, its
charger should switch to a lower constant voltage than what was
used for previous charging [13].
For our evaluation of NILL, we model a 50 Ah3 lead-acid battery
operating at a nominal voltage of 120V. This is achievable by con-
necting typical 50 Ah sealed DC batteries, which typically retail for
approximately $100 [2], in series. One of the most common volt-
ages for these types of batteries is 12V, requiring 10 such batteries
(approx. $1,000) to achieve the necessary characteristics. We use a
60 ampere (A) maximum discharge current system as available in
modern home solar setups [1].
3. Non-Intrusive Load Leveling
The goal of a NILL system is to level the load proﬁle to a con-
stant target load, thus removing appliance features. To achieve this,
NILL relies on a battery to offset the power consumed by appli-
ances. When an appliance turns ON, it will exert a load beyond the
target load. Thus, NILL will discharge the battery to partially sup-
ply the load created by the appliance, maintaining the target load.4
Similarly, if an appliance enters the OFF state, the load proﬁle will
decrease below the target load. These opportunities are used to
charge the battery while restoring the target load. The NILL sys-
tem presented here consists of two parts: a battery and a control
system that regulates the battery’s charge and discharge based on
the present load and battery state. The controller attempts to main-
tain a steady state target load KSS, but will go into one of two
special states KL or KH if the battery needs to recover from a low
or high state of charge. This section describes the NILL runtime
control system and the calculation of the initial system parameters.
3.1 Run Time Control
In a perfect NILL implementation, there would be no runtime
control as the battery would have sufﬁcient capacity for maintain-
ing the target load. For any reasonably sized battery, there will be
times when the state of charge is insufﬁcient to maintain the target
load under a heavy load. We call this a low recovery state because
the battery’s SOC has become too low to maintain the target load.
3Ah stands for amp-hours, which is a measure of the battery charge
capacity.
4The battery is only used to supply appliances in the house. It is
never discharged back into the grid as is done in net metering.
