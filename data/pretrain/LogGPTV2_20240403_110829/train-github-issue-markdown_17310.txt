## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**  
After searching in the "search" bottom panel, only one the workspace files
should appear.  
After last update it shows both the "workspace file" and the "localhost file".
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
Making the search results more readable and avoid redundant items.  
And avoid "this file has not been saved" yellow alert icon that appears in the
edited "workspace files" every time you unwillingly edit the "localhost file"
instead.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
It was showing only the workspace one version ago, I think that's fine, but
maybe this has a reason that I can't understand, so I think the best way would
add an option.
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
yes, sure!
