## Feature Request

**Expected Behavior:**
When performing a search in the bottom "Search" panel, only files from the current workspace should be displayed. After the most recent update, the search results now include both "workspace files" and "localhost files."

**Motivation or Use Case:**
This change aims to improve the readability of search results by eliminating redundant items. Additionally, it will prevent the unnecessary display of the "this file has not been saved" yellow alert icon, which appears when a user inadvertently edits a "localhost file" instead of a "workspace file."

**Proposed Implementation:**
In the previous version, the search functionality only showed workspace files, which was sufficient. However, if there is a specific reason for the inclusion of localhost files, I suggest adding an option to toggle between displaying only workspace files or both workspace and localhost files.

**Willingness to Work on This:**
Yes, I am willing to work on this feature.
