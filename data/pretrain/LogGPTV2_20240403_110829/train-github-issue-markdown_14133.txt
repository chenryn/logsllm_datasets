### Apache Airflow version
2.3.1 (latest released)
### What happened
I have added a new task to an existsting workflow (DAG), where the other tasks
already had previous runs.  
When I added the new task, the grid became inaccessible, because it wanted to
get `runId`s for the new task, which did not exist.  
An error occured in the grid..js, but since the file is minified/obfuscated,
it's unclear for me where exactly.
### What you think should happen instead
The grid should handle missing `runId` without causing an exception.
### How to reproduce
  1. Create a simple dag, with a few dummy tasks, and let it run a few times. Check out the grid (it should be okay).
  2. After that, add a new dummy task, and check out the grid again. The grid's area will be empty, and the JS console will have the following error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'runId')`
Probably any other scenarios where the tasks run history is uneven, could also
cause this error.
