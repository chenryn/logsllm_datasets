Foreign Scientists Avoid U.S. 
Foreign scientists have expressed concerns about 
traveling to the U.S. following the arrest of Russian 
programmer Dmitry Sklyarov. Some foreign scientists 
have advocated boycotting conferences held in the U.S. 
and a number of conference bodies have decided to 
move their conferences to non-U.S. locations. Russia 
has issued a travel warning to Russian programmers 
traveling to the U.S.

Highly respected British Linux programmer Alan 
Cox resigned from the USENIX committee of the 
Advanced 
Computing 
Systems 
Association, 
the 
committee that organizes many of the U.S. computing 
conferences, because of his concerns about traveling to 
the U.S. Cox has urged USENIX to hold its annual 
conference offshore. The International Information 
Hiding Workshop Conference, the conference at which 
Professor Felten’s team intended to present its original 
paper, has chosen to hold all of its future conferences 
outside of the U.S. following the SDMI threat to 
Professor Felten and his team. 
2600 Magazine Censored 
The Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes case6 illustrates 
the chilling effect that section 1201 has had on the 
freedom of the press.  
In that case, eight major motion picture companies 
brought a DMCA suit against 2600 magazine seeking to 
block it from publishing the DeCSS software program, 
which defeats the encryption used on DVD movies. 
2600 had made the program available on its web site in 
the course of ongoing coverage of the controversy 
surrounding the DMCA. The magazine was not 
involved in the development of software, nor was it 
accused of having used the software for any copyright 
infringement.

CNET Reporter Feels Chill 
Prominent CNET News reporter Declan McCullagh 
recently found four publicly-available documents on 
the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
website. The website announced that the documents 
contained 
information 
about 
airport 
security 
procedures, the relationship between federal and local 
police, and a “liability information sheet.” A note on 
the site stated that this “information is restricted to 
airport management and local law enforcement.” No 
password was necessary to download the documents, 
but they were distributed in encrypted form and a 
password was required to open and read them.  
McCullagh obtained the passwords from an 
anonymous source, but fear of DMCA liability stopped 
him from reading the documents—using a password 
without authorization could violate Section 1201. This 
is particularly ironic, as any foreign journalist beyond 
the reach of the DMCA would be free to use the 
password.  
“Journalists traditionally haven't worried about 
copyright law all that much,” said McCullagh, “But 
nowadays intellectual property rights have gone too far, 
and arguably interfere with the newsgathering process.”

Microsoft Threatens Slashdot 
In spring 2000, Microsoft invoked the DMCA 
against the Internet publication forum Slashdot, 
demanding that forum moderators delete materials 
relating to Microsoft’s proprietary implementation of 
an open security standard known as Kerberos.   
In the Slashdot forum, several individuals alleged 
that Microsoft had changed the open, non-proprietary 
Kerberos specification in order to prevent non-
Microsoft servers from interacting with Windows 2000. 
Many speculated that this move was intended to force 
users to purchase Microsoft server software. Although 
Microsoft responded to this criticism by publishing its 
Kerberos specification, it conditioned access to the 
specification on agreement to a “click-wrap” license 
agreement that expressly forbade disclosure of the 
specification without  Microsoft’s prior consent.  
Slashdot posters responded by republishing the 
Microsoft specification. Microsoft then invoked the 
DMCA, demanding that Slashdot remove the 
republished specifications.  
In the words of Georgetown law professor Julie 
Cohen, “If Microsoft's interpretation of the DMCA's 
ban on circumvention technologies is right, then it 
doesn't seem to matter much whether posting 
unauthorized copies of the Microsoft Kerberos 
specification would be a fair use. A publisher can 
prohibit fair-use commentary simply by implementing 
access and disclosure restrictions that bind the entire 
public. Anyone who discloses the information, or even 
tells others how to get it, is a felon.”

AVSforum.com Censors TiVo Discussion 
The specter of DMCA litigation has chilled speech 
on smaller web bulletin boards, as well. In June 2001, 
for example, the administrator of AVSforum.com, a 
popular forum where TiVo digital video recorder 
owners discuss TiVo features, censored all discussion 
about a software program that allegedly permitted TiVo 
users to move video from their TiVos to their personal 
computers. In the words of the forum administrator, 
“My fear with this is more or less I have no clue what is 
a protected system on the TiVo box under copyright 
(or what-have-you) and what is not. Thus my fear for 
the site.”

4. Fair Use Under Siege  
“Fair use” is a crucial element in American copyright 
law—the principle that the public is entitled, without 
having to ask permission, to use copyrighted works so 
long as these uses do not unduly interfere with the 
copyright owner’s market for a work. Fair uses include 
personal, noncommercial uses, such as using a VCR to 
record a television program for later viewing.  Fair use 
Unintended Consequences: Four Years Under the DMCA

also includes activities undertaken for purposes such as 
criticism, 
comment, 
news 
reporting, 
teaching, 
scholarship or research.   
Fair Use Tools Banned 
We are entering an era where books, music and 
movies will increasingly be “copy-protected” and 
otherwise restricted by technological means. Whether 
scholars, researchers, commentators and the public will 
continue to be able to make legitimate fair uses of these 
works will depend upon the availability of tools to 
bypass these digital locks.  
While stopping copyright infringement is an 
important policy objective, Section 1201 throws out the 
baby of fair use with the bathwater of digital piracy. By 
employing technical protection measures to control 
access to and use of copyrighted works, and using 
section 1201 litigation against anyone who tampers 
with those measures, copyright owners can unilaterally 
eliminate fair use, re-writing the copyright bargain 
developed by Congress and the courts over more than 
a century.  
The DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions, how-
ever, prohibit the creation or distribution of these tools, 
even if they are crucial to fair use. So, as copyright 
owners use technology to press into the 21st century, 
the public will see more and more fair uses whittled 
away by digital locks allegedly intended to “prevent 
piracy.” Perhaps more importantly, no future fair uses 
will be developed—after all, before the VCR, who 
could have imagined that fair use “time-shifting” of 
television would become common-place for the 
average consumer?  
Copy-protected CDs  
The introduction of “copy-protected” CDs into the 
marketplace illustrates the collision between fair use 
and the DMCA. Record labels are aggressively 
incorporating 
“copy-protection” 
on 
new 
music 
releases. Over 10 million copy-protected discs are 
already in circulation, according to Midbar Technology 
Ltd, one of the vendors of copy-protection technology. 
Sony claims that it has released over 11 million copy-
protected discs worldwide.  
Copyright owners argue that these tools, in the hands 
of copyright infringers, can result in “Internet piracy.” 
But the traditional answer for piracy under copyright 
law has been to seek out and prosecute the infringers, 
not to ban the tools that enable fair use. After all, 
photocopiers, VCRs, and CD-R burners can also be 
misused, but no one would suggest that the public give 
them up simply because they might be used by others 
to break the law. 
Whatever the impact that these copy protection 
technologies may have on online infringement, they are 
certain to interfere with the fair use expectations of 
consumers. For example, copy-protected discs will 
disappoint the hundreds of thousands of consumers 
who have purchased MP3 players, despite the fact that 
making an MP3 copy of a CD for personal use is a fair 
use. Making “mix CDs” or copies of CDs for the office 
or car are other examples of fair uses that are 
potentially impaired by copy-protection technologies.  
DeCSS and DVD Copy Plus 
Fair use tools have already been yanked off the 
market. In the Universal v. Reimerdes case, discussed 
above, the court held that Section 1201 bans DeCSS 
software. This software decrypts DVD movies, making 
it possible to copy them to a PC. In another case, a 
company has filed a declaratory judgment action in San 
Francisco after being threatened with DMCA liability 
by the MPAA for distributing DVD Copy Plus, which 
enables DVD owners to make copies of DVD content. 
The major motion picture studios have since counter-
sued, alleging that DVD copying tools violate the 
DMCA. 
Companies that distribute tools to “repair” these 
dysfunctional CDs, restoring to consumers their fair 
use privileges, run the risk of lawsuits under section 
1201’s ban on circumvention tools and technologies.

There are lots of legitimate reasons to copy DVDs. 
Once the video is on the PC, for example, lots of fair 
uses become possible—film scholars can digitally 
analyze the film, travelers can load the movie into their 
laptops, and parents can fast-forward through the 
“unskippable” commercials that preface certain films. 
Without the tools necessary to copy DVDs, however, 
these fair uses become impossible.

Advanced e-Book Processor and e-Books 
The future of fair use for books was at issue in the 
criminal 
prosecution 
of 
Dmitry 
Sklyarov 
and 
ElcomSoft. As discussed above, ElcomSoft produced 
and distributed a tool called the Advanced e-Book 
Processor, which translates e-books from Adobe’s 
e-Book format to Adobe’s Portable Document Format 
(“PDF”). This translation process removes the various 
restrictions (against copying, printing, text-to-speech 
processing, etc.) that publishers can impose on 
e-Books. The program is designed to work only with 
e-Books that have been lawfully purchased from sales 
outlets.  
The Advanced e-Book Processor allowed those who 
have legitimately purchased e-Books to make fair uses 
of their e-Books, which would otherwise not be 
possible with the current Adobe e-Book format. For 
instance, the program allows people to engage in the 
following activities, all of which are fair uses:  
• 
read it on a laptop or computer other than 
the one on which the e-Book was first 
downloaded;  
• 
continue to access a work in the future, if 
the particular technological device for
