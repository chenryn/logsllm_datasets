User: Please give a solution to the server DDoS attack.
Assistant: 1. Strengthen the security of network equipment: For network equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-DDoS equipment, etc. can be deployed to enhance security. 2. Reasonably plan the network architecture: For the server architecture, multi-level, multi-node, and multi-cluster can be adopted to disperse the attack traffic. 3. Reasonably divert business: divert business to multiple nodes to avoid single point of failure, allow traffic to be dispersed on different nodes, and reduce single point pressure. 4. Install DDoS protection equipment: Purchase enterprise-level DDoS protection equipment. These equipment have been professionally verified and can effectively resist various DDoS attacks, and can coordinate multiple security mechanisms to work together to resist attacks and ensure network security. 5. Scientifically control user access: control the link speed of access, and limit the impact of illegal network traffic on the server. 6. Continuously improve server performance: choose better servers to speed up the operation and reduce the destructive power of attackers. 7. Contact the ISP manufacturer: If you suffer a large-scale attack and cannot cope with it, you need to contact the ISP manufacturer in time to help solve it, and cooperate with all parties to fight each other.
