by **mikaelbrg** :
    After updating from go1.0.3 to tip, I am no longer able to build my module, which uses a
    .so-file and cgo (to communicate with hardware). The log below shows the result of
    building with the latest tip version (produces error), and with go1.0.3 (successful).

    mikaelbe@ITK-D727 ~/work/sotest
    $ go build sotest
    # sotest
