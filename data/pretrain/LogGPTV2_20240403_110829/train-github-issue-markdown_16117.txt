**Reported by mikaelbrg:**

After updating from Go 1.0.3 to the latest development version (tip), I am unable to build my module, which relies on a `.so` file and cgo for hardware communication. The following logs illustrate the issue: building with the latest development version results in an error, while building with Go 1.0.3 is successful.

### Environment Details
- **Go Version (Development Tip):**
  ```sh
  go version devel +9ca85035f95a Thu Mar 21 22:37:13 2013 -0700 windows/amd64
  ```

- **Go Version (1.0.3):**
  ```sh
  go version go1.0.3
  ```

### Build Logs

#### Using Development Tip
```sh
mikaelbe@ITK-D727 ~/work/sotest
$ go build sotest
# sotest
C:\Users\mikaelbe\AppData\Local\Temp\go-build854994423\sotest.a(_all.o): malformed pe file: unexpected flags for PE section .idata$2
```

#### Using Go 1.0.3
```sh
mikaelbe@ITK-D727 ~/work/sotest
$ go build sotest
```
- **Result:** Successful build, producing an executable file.

### Steps to Reproduce the Problem
1. Source code, including `.go`, `.so`, and `.h` files, is available at:
   - [sotest Repository](https://bitbucket.org/mikaelbe/sotest/overview)
2. Build the project using the command:
   ```sh
   go build sotest
   ```

### Expected Output
- An executable file should be generated.

### Actual Output
- The build process fails with the following error:
  ```sh
  C:\Users\mikaelbe\AppData\Local\Temp\go-build854994423\sotest.a(_all.o): malformed pe file: unexpected flags for PE section .idata$2
  ```

### Additional Information
- **Compiler Used:** Not sure.
- **Operating System:** Windows 7 (64-bit)
- **Go Version (Development Tip):**
  ```sh
  go version devel +9ca85035f95a Thu Mar 21 22:37:13 2013 -0700
