**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.9

**Code:**
```typescript
new Map([1, 2].map(x => [x, x]));
```

**Error:**
```
Argument of type 'number[][]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Iterable<[unknown, unknown]>'.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The types should be inferred correctly, and no error should be shown.

**Actual Behavior:**
A type error is displayed.

**Explanation:**
The `Map` constructor expects an `Iterable<[K, V]>`, where `K` and `V` are the key and value types, respectively. In this case, the `map` function returns an array of arrays (`number[][]`), which does not match the expected `Iterable<[number, number]>`.

**Solution:**
To fix this, you can use the `entries` method to convert the array into an iterable of key-value pairs:

```typescript
new Map([1, 2].map(x => [x, x]) as [number, number][]);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `from` method of `Map`:

```typescript
Map.from([1, 2].map(x => [x, x]));
```

This will ensure that the types are correctly inferred and no type error is shown.
