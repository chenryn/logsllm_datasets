**ATT&CK ID:** M1037  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

To mitigate and filter malicious network traffic, consider leveraging services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or specialized providers that focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation. These services can help filter traffic upstream, before it reaches your network.

At the network boundary, implement the following filtering strategies:
- **Block Source Addresses:** Identify and block IP addresses that are the source of the attack.
- **Block Targeted Ports:** Restrict access to ports that are being targeted by the attackers.
- **Block Malicious Protocols:** Disable protocols that are being used for malicious transport.

For specific types of attacks, such as SYN floods, enable SYN Cookies to manage and mitigate the impact of these attacks effectively.
