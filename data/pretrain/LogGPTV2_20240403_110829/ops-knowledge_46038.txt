User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题cannot log in to the server after changing SSH port I am using putty to connect to my Ubuntu 16.04 VPS. 

I decided to change the default SSH port from 22 to 443. 
I did this changing the line 

Port 22


in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

to Port 443

Now when I am trying to connect to the server using port 443 I get the error saying "Server unexpectedly closed network connection"

When I try to connect to the server using port 22 I get the error saying "Network error: Connection refused"

The server is up and running I just cannot connect to it anymore, is there anyway to fix this?

EDIT: I reinstalled the VPS and reconfigured it again. 
The possible issue that might have caused this could be that I used the same port to connect to my VPS using Putty and to use that same port for my proxy in squid.

Assistant: is there anyway to fix this?



Use the system console (out of band connection) if available.
Use the VPS recovery boot to mount the VPS disk and then edit the sshd_config file to reset the port to 22 from 443.


Less optimally 


Boot a new VPS instance, configure as per the first instance using your configuration management tools and recover from backups.
