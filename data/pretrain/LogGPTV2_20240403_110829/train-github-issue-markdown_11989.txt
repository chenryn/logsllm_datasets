In the The Local Weather App example
(http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/pen/yNBJRj), the weather information
(temperature, current weather, and wind speed) is no longer showing up. The
reason appears to be that the Open Weather Map API where the app is pulling
the data from now requires you to sign up for an API key. I tested this out on
my own version and once I added the key, the page worked again.
