In the Local Weather App example (available at <http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/pen/yNBJRj>), the weather information, including temperature, current conditions, and wind speed, is not displaying. The issue appears to be that the OpenWeatherMap API, which the app uses to fetch data, now requires users to sign up for an API key.

To resolve this, I tested a version of the app with an API key, and once the key was added, the weather information displayed correctly.
