Abstract
Oblivious Transfer has played a crucial role in the design of secure multi party computation.
Nevertheless, there are not many practical solutions that achieve simulation based security and
at the same time instantiable based on diﬀerent assumptions.
In this work, we consider a simulation based security notion that we call endemic security.
We show how to construct highly eﬃcient oblivious transfer in the random oracle model that
achieves endemic security under a wide range of assumptions, among them DDH, CDH, LWE
and coding based assumptions. We construct a secure oblivious transfer based on DDH that
takes only a single communication round which allows signiﬁcant performance gains. We also
instantiate our oblivious transfer with the Crystals.Kyber key agreement. Our implementation
shows that both instantiations can be computed in under one millisecond.
Further, we revisit, correct and improve existing oblivious transfer extension techniques. We
provide an implementation of an oblivious transfer extension protocol in the ideal cipher model
that is actively secure, processing up to 23 million OTs per second and up to 10 times faster than
previous secure implementations. We also show that our framework can compute endemically
secure OT extension and the base OTs in just two rounds.
1 Introduction
An oblivious transfer (OT) [Rab81, EGL82] is a cryptographic primitive often used in the context
of secure multi party computation, which allows to preserve the privacy during a joint computation.
Among others, it solves the task of securely distributing cryptographic keys for garbled circuits,
which can be seen as encrypted programs. The combination of garbled circuits and oblivious
transfer gives a generic solution for securely computing any functionality between two parties
[Yao82, Yao86, Kil88, IPS08, IKO+11] and multiple parties [CvT95, BL18, GS18].
In an OT, a sender and a receiver interact in a protocol and at the end of the protocol, the
sender outputs two messages s0, s1 while the receiver outputs b, sb for choice bit b. Security asks
that the sender does not learn b and the receiver does not learn s1−b. It is known that an OT
implies key exchange and can be constructed from special types of public key encryption (PKE)
[GKM+00, PVW08, FMV18], generalizations of dual mode PKE [GIS18] or certiﬁed trapdoor
permutations [ORS15]. Though, all of these solutions come with some drawbacks when it comes to
practical deployment. They either only achieve a weak security notion [GKM+00] or lack eﬃciency
due to a special type of commitment protocol [Kil92, ORS15, FMV18] or dual-mode cryptosystem
[PVW08, GIS18], which is less eﬃcient than standard PKE and only known from DDH, QR and
LWE with weaker parameter choices1. There exist also solutions tailored to speciﬁc assumptions.
1Peikert et al. require SIVP hardness for approximation factor ˜O(n3.5) while Regev’s PKE [Reg05] only requires
˜O(n1.5).

Naor and Pinkas [NP01] constructed OTs from the DDH assumption and Brakerski and D¨ottling
[BD18] from the LWE assumption that requires similar parameter choices as Peikert et al [PVW08].
In practice, a common approach is to use a critical amount of OTs in the random oracle model
(ROM) [BR93] and then extend the amount of OTs to the desired amount of OTs using OT exten-
sion [Bea96, IKNP03, OOS17, ALSZ15, KOS15]. A random oracle is an ideal hash function that
usually is instantiated with a concrete hash function in the implementation. The ROM brings ma-
jor eﬃciency improvements and is therefore very common for practical cryptographic constructions,
even though it might bring potential security weaknesses [CGH98].
In the ROM, Bellare & Micali [BM90] constructed OT based on the CDH assumption. Chou
& Orlandi [CO15] claimed a more eﬃcient OT construction which was proven with some caveats
under the GapDH assumption [HL17]. Hauck & Loss improved the construction to base it on the
[BDD+17] constructed an CDH based OT in the global
CDH assumption [HL17]. Barreto et al.
random oracle model.
A drawback of the more eﬃcient constructions of Chou & Orlandi, Hauck & Loss, and Barreto
et al.
is that they require three or more rounds. The former also suﬀers technical issues with
the ability to extract the input of the receiver [CO15, BPRS17]. Further, unlike the more generic
constructions based on PKE, they are tailored to speciﬁc assumptions. A more generic construction
for OT in the ROM would be preferable since it allows an easier transition to diﬀerent assumption
like LWE or LPN, which unlike CDH and DDH are assumed to oﬀer security in presence of quantum
computers. In this work, we therefore want to focus on the question:
How to construct a versatile, highly eﬃcient and fully secure OT in the ROM?
For eﬃciency, we ask for a minimal round complexity, low computational complexity and com-
patibility with OT extension techniques.
1.1 Our Contribution
We start with a basic security deﬁnition which has previously been considered by Garg, Ishai and
Srinivasan [GIS18] as OT correlations functionality. We call this security endemic security and
denote an OT that is endemically secure with endemic OT. Endemic security allows to achieve a
minimal round complexity, also denoted as non-interactive OT [BM90, GIS18] as well as analyze
the security of optimized existing OT and OT extension protocols.
In Section 3, we compare endemic security notion with other notions and show that an endemic
OT can eﬃciently be transformed such the other considered security notions are achieved but
potentially at the cost of a higher round complexity. We also show that only endemic security
permits a one-round or non-interactive OT.
In Section 4, we give a construction in the ROM that transforms any two message key agreement
protocol, where the distribution of one of the messages is computationally close to uniform, into
an endemically secure two message 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer2. Further, if the key agreement
protocol is a one-round protocol, we obtain a one-round endemic OT. This implies that we get a
one-round endemic OT from DDH, CDH and two round endemic OT from LWE, LPN, McEliece
and Subset Sum. We emphasize that [GIS18] construct a one-round UC secure OT from LWE,
DDH, QR in the CRS model, while we focus on stand-alone security in the random oracle model
in favor of eﬃciency.
2In Appendix C, we show how the framework can be adapted to obtain an endemically secure (n − 1)-out-of-n
OT.

In Section 5, we show that our construction is compatible with OT extension techniques. Con-
cretely, we show that endemic OTs can be extended to a larger amount of endemic OTs using only
one additional round. This allows us to obtain poly(κ) OTs using only O(κ) public key operations
in only two rounds. We revisit the OT extension protocol of Keller et al., Orr`u et al. and Asharov
et al.
[KOS15, OOS17, ALSZ17] under endemic security. It turns out that its uniform message
security can be fully broken. We point out attacks and provide ﬁxes such that classical, uniform
and endemic security can be obtained. Finally, we observe that most OT extension protocols are
implemented [Rin, Kel, WMK16] using an ideal cipher in place of a random oracle. However, these
implementations have no security proofs and we show that they too can be fully broken. We give
new protocols and proofs in the ideal cipher model which allows a 10 times speed up on the ROM
when implemented.
In Section 6, we implement our construction based on the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange and the
Module LWE (MLWE) based Kyber key encapsulation [SAB+17]. We emphasize that it can also
be instantiated with many of the other NIST post-quantum standardisation candidates and is to
the best of our knowledge the ﬁrst implementation of a quantum resistant OT.
1.2 Our Techniques
Endemic Security. When deﬁning malicious security of an OT, one deﬁnes an ideal functionality
FOT. An OT is called secure, if for any adversary against the OT scheme, there exists an adversary
interacting with FOT producing the same output. Classically, FOT either receives the OT strings s0,
s1 as input from the sender or samples them uniformly at random and outputs them to the sender.
But there are also OTs where the receiver can determine the OT strings or even both parties could
inﬂuence how the OT strings are generated. We distinguish four main security notions.
Uniform Message Security: The ideal functionality F U
OT samples the OT strings uniformly and
outputs them to sender and one to the receiver.
Sender Chosen Message Security: The ideal functionality F S
the sender and outputs one of the strings to the receiver.
OT receives the OT strings from
Receiver Chosen Message Security: The ideal functionality F R
OT receives one of the OT strings
from the receiver, samples the other one uniformly at random and outputs the strings to the
sender.
Endemic Security If the sender is malicious, it chooses both strings. If the receiver is malicious,
it chooses one of the strings. All strings that are not chosen yet, are sampled uniformly by
the functionality F E
OT. The sender obtains both strings and the receiver obtains one.
Notice that endemic security gives the weakest security guarantees, no matter whether the
receiver or the sender is malicious, the malicious party can always determine the distribution of
the OT messages. Uniform message security gives very strong security guarantees since a malicious
party can never inﬂuence the distribution.
Relations Between Security Notions. We show on one hand that an OT with uniform message
security is also secure with respect to all other security notions. On the other hand, uniform,
sender and receiver chosen message security imply endemic security. Still, there are very simple
transformations from an endemically secure OT to an OT that achieves any of the other security
notions. Though we remark that uniform message security implies and therefore requires a secure
coin tossing protocol. In Figure 1 we give an overview over these implications and transformations.

We also show that endemic OT is weaker than the other notions but at the same time this
allows a minimal round complexity of a single round. More precisely, we show that there is no one
round OT that achieves sender or receiver chosen message security.
From Key Agreement to OT A common strategy to construct OT from PKE is to use a PKE
where the public keys form a group [PVW08, BDD+17], which we will denote with (G,⊕). By giving
a challenge c and forcing the receiver to generate two public keys pk0 and pk1 s.t. c = pk0 ⊕ pk1,
he can intuitively only decrypt ciphertexts with respect to one of them. But this does not actually
follow from the standard notion of PKE since an adversary could generate pk0 and pk1 jointly given
c. It requires a dual-mode cryptosystem [PVW08, GIS18] that is tailored towards this property.
Dual-mode cryptosystems are known from DDH, QR and LWE [PVW08] but is not clear how to
extend these results to other assumptions.
Another approach [ORS15, FMV18] uses speciﬁc commitment protocols which forces the re-
ceiver to commit to a public key before c is known. The drawback of this approach is that it
requires four rounds and the known constructions of such a commitment protocol are not eﬃcient
[Kil92, ORS15].
We propose a diﬀerent solution that uses a novel and simple technique to leverage the power
of a random oracle. Rather than choosing two public keys, we ask the receiver to generate two
strings r0, r1 in G. From these strings a sender can generate the public keys pk0 = r0 ⊕ H(r1),
pk1 = r1 ⊕ H(r0) under which he can encrypt the two OT messages s0, s1. In the actual protocol,
the receiver can program rb ∈ {r0, r1} to a public key for his choice of b ∈ {0, 1}. He samples r1−b
and sets rb = pk (cid:9) H(r1−b).
This technique also allows to extract s0, s1 from a malicious sender by programming the random
oracle such that secret keys for both, pk0 and pk1 are known. Further, one can extract b from a
malicious receiver by programming the random oracle as well.
Intuitively, a malicious receiver
needs to query either r0 or r1 ﬁrst. His choice will determine r1−b, since all following random oracle
queries q can be programmed such that H(q) = pk(cid:48) − r1−b for a public key pk(cid:48).
If a malicious
adversary can learn s1−b, he will decrypt a ciphertext for pk1−b = r1−b ⊕ H(q) = pk(cid:48) and be able to
break the PKE scheme.
We optimize the protocol further by using a key agreement instead of a PKE scheme. In many
settings, the OT messages don’t need to be chosen, it is suﬃcient if they are pseudorandom. Hence,
no ciphertext needs to be generated, only the exchanged keys need to be computed. This save in
some settings a communication round, e.g. in case of the Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange [DH76].

In the main body of this paper, we only consider stand-alone security. We show UC security
for some settings of our protocol in Appendix E.
Secure OT Extension.
In Section 5 we explore the rich implications endemic security has on
eﬃcient 1-out-of-N OT extension along with presenting three new attacks and ﬁxes of existing OT
extension protocols[KOS15, OOS17] with Uniform Message security3. These protocols are derived
from the seminal black-box protocol of Ishia, Kilian, Nissim and Petrank[IKNP03]. We note that
in all cases the Sender Chosen Message variant of these protocols[IKNP03, KOS15, OOS17] are
secure. The functionality of 1-out-of-N OT extension allows nC ≈ κ instances of 1-out-of-2 OTs
to be transformed into m = poly(κ) instances of 1-out-of-N OTs. There are several advantages
of this transformation. 1) m can be polynomial times larger than nC. 2) Only symmetric key
cryptography is required which provides a larger performance improvement. 3) In some cases N
can be exponential in the security parameter κ which we indicate with the use of capital N .
The 1-out-of-2 OTs that are being transformed are referred to as base OTs. Existing protocols
[IKNP03, ALSZ15, KOS15, OOS17] have called for the use of base OTs with the sender chosen
message security notion, e.g. F S
OT. However, we show that this requirement can be relaxed to
allow the base OTs to only achieve endemic security. In both cases (F S
OT base OTs) the
OT extension protocol outputs messages that satisfy the endemic security notion. Traditional
OT extension protocols, e.g.
1,N ,
Figure 4) to realize the sender chosen message functionality F S
OT. This observation suggests that
more eﬃcient OT extension can be realized by replacing Sender Chosen Message base OTs with
Endemic OTs, e.g. our protocol. The authors of [KOS15, OOS17] suggest that the ΠS
1,N transform
can be removed and resulting protocol would satisfy the uniform message security notion, but in
Section 5.1 we show this to not be the case.
[IKNP03, ALSZ15, KOS15], then apply a simple transform (ΠS
OT or F E
In particular, Section 5.1 detail three attacks where the ﬁrst allows a malicious party to bias
the OT messages that they output while the second and third attacks succeed even when base OTs
with uniform message security are used. In all cases, the ability to bias the messages violates the
ideal functionality which samples them uniformly at random. Therefore, we show that the protocol
only achieves Endemic security.
We note that many protocols that utilize Uniform Message security can likely tolerate the
weaker notion of Endemic security, e.g.
[RR17a, RR17b]. However, other protocols such as the
set inclusion protocol of [OOS17, Figure 5] are insecure4 when Uniform Message security is not
satisﬁed.
Uniform message security can be achieved from endemic OT extension in several ways. One
solution is a black-box transformation ΠU
1,N (Figure 6) which lifts an OT protocol with endemic
security to satisfy uniform message security. However, this would require additional rounds and
signiﬁcant communication. We demonstrate an alternative solution which replaces the base OTs
with a protocol that satisﬁes uniform message, uniform selection security F Uu
OT and prove that this
yields an OT extension protocol with uniform message security with minimal need to modify the
extension protocol. More generally, Figure 2 shows the relation between diﬀerent base OT security
notions and the resulting OT extension security.
