Question: "In a team discussion about mobile application security, one developer argues that using 'dlfcn.h' for dynamic loading of shared libraries is always a security risk and should be avoided. As a security expert, how would you counter this argument?"
 "A": "Dynamic loading is inherently secure and poses no risk, so 'dlfcn.h' can be used without concern for security."
 "B": "Although dynamic loading can introduce security risks, using 'dlfcn.h' with best practices such as absolute paths and immediate symbol resolution mitigates these risks."
 "C": "Dynamic loading of shared libraries is not supported on mobile platforms, so the use of 'dlfcn.h' is irrelevant."
 "D": "Using 'dlfcn.h' is only secure when loading libraries that have been statically linked at compile-time."
Answer: B
