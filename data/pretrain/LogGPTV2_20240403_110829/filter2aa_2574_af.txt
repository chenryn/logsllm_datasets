Logical destruction: This is the most widely used technique to 
destroy data while maintaining storage medium for future use. This 
technique works by using specialized software to cover the old data 
and remnants of data with random characters written by the wiping 
tool. There are many wiping algorithms already used to destroy data 
digitally in this way; some are more secure than others. However, 
what you should know when using such a technique to destroy data is 
that it cannot guarantee 100 percent removal of all data on your drive. 
Some advanced recovery techniques that are hardware based are 
still able to capture your old data, or at least parts of it (but doing so 
is costly and time-consuming). Logical data destruction techniques 
have some disadvantages too; they need time to finish because they 
must write random data multiple times (several passes) over all 
the available sectors on the hard drive. In addition, this technique 
assumes your hard drive is working and writable to write the random 
data into it. Another challenge to wiping software comes when using 
it to wipe data stored using the RAID technology. This technology 
offers fault tolerance by mirroring data onto multiple disk drives 
in different physical locations. In such a situation, the wiping tool 
should track all mirrored data across all enterprise storage servers.
Different standards have been developed to wipe data (logical data destruction) on 
hard drives. Table 2-3 shows the most popular ones.

Destroying your digital traces is important when conducting OSINT searches. Bear 
in mind that browsers, image-viewing software, Microsoft Office programs, and anything 
you do on your computer will leave digital traces. By using the advice in this section, you 
will make tracking your traces difficult and even impossible.
Warning! For people (law enforcement and military officials) conducting top- 
secret OSINT searches who need the maximum anonymity possible, it is highly 
advisable to use an anonymous OS like Tails OS, covered later in the chapter.
 General Privacy Settings
In this section, we list some recommendations to maintain your privacy when going 
online. Some of these tips can be considered trivial at first; however, it is important 
to implement them because not doing so can cause serious damage to your privacy if 
exploited by outside adversaries.
 Covering Your Laptop Camera
Hackers and intelligence services go after computer cameras and microphones when 
targeting specific people. So, it is advisable to cover your webcams with tape for security 
reasons.
 Avoiding Pirated Software
Pirated software can include malicious payload—like a Trojan or keylogger—that can 
invade user privacy and spy on the computing device. It is strongly advised not to access 
pirated websites that distribute illegal contents such as Torrent websites.
If you prefer to use freeware programs downloaded from the Internet, it is highly 
advisable to use your antivirus solution to scan them before executing them. To become 
more confident, you can scan the downloaded program with free scan services, which 
comes in handy when you want to scan a specific file/program using multiple antivirus 
engines.

VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com) is a free service that analyzes suspicious 
files and URLs and facilitates the quick detection of viruses, worms, Trojans, and all 
kinds of malware. All you need to do is enter the website URL you want to check or 
upload the file/program to see whether it is clear from malware threats.
 Handling Digital Files Metadata
Metadata is data about data; it contains descriptive—usually hidden—information about 
the file it belongs to. Digital file metadata includes the author name, file size, location, 
creation date/time, and comments.
Conceptually, all digital file types can include metadata. From a privacy perspective, 
users are mainly concerned about the metadata that exists in digital images, audio files, 
and video files. Microsoft Office—and other digital text document creation software—
also contains a wealth of metadata. Metadata usually comes stored in the digital file; 
however, some file types store it in a separate file.
One metadata type existing within images files is EXIF. This is a standard that 
specifies the format for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras 
(including smartphones), scanners, and other systems handling image and sound files 
recorded by digital cameras. EXIF data is embedded within the image file and works with 
JPEG images only. EXIF metadata can contain geolocation metadata in addition to a 
wide array of technical information.
Other types include Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), which supports 
different digital file types and is not limited to images, and the International Press 
Telecommunications Council (IPTC), which is considered an older meta-information 
format.
It is advisable to check the metadata of all digital files before uploading them to the 
Internet or sharing them with colleagues to avoid leaking private information about 
yourself and the device. There are many freeware tools that can view and edit a digital 
file’s metadata; we’ll begin with digital images.
Exif Pilot (www.colorpilot.com/exif.html) is a free EXIF editor that allows you to 
view, edit, and remove EXIF, EXIF GPS, IPTC, and XMP data in addition to adding new 
tags and importing and exporting EXIF and IPTC to/from text and Microsoft Excel files.
Other free tools that can be used to view image metadata are GIMP  
(https://www.gimp.org) and XnView (www.xnview.com/en/), which comes free for 
private and educational use (see Figure 2-7).

Windows comes with a built-in function that allows you to view and remove some 
metadata associated with documents and digital images. However, keep in mind that 
Windows may not be able to remove all EXIF tags, so if you intend on sharing important 
files, always use the suggested third-party tools already mentioned.
To remove EXIF using Windows, right-click the image, select Properties, and go to 
the Details tab. At the bottom, click Remove Properties and Personal Information to 
open the EXIF removal tool. The tool lets you either create a copy of the image with all 
the metadata removed or pick and choose which properties to erase from the selected 
file (see Figure 2-8).

As we already said, metadata also exists within PDFs, Microsoft Office files, and 
audio and video files. In this section, we will briefly cover some useful tools to clear 
metadata from such file types.
To clear metadata from PDF files, Adobe has a feature called Sanitize Document. 
After clicking it, you can remove all the hidden metadata from the intended PDF file  
(see Figure 2-9).

Note! Not all versions of adobe reader support the sanitization feature. If 
your current version does not have this feature, you can use third-party tools 
to remove metadata from your pdF files such as BeCypdFmetaedit (www.
becyhome.de/becypdfmetaedit/description_eng.htm) or pdF metadata 
editor (http://broken-by.me/pdf-metadata-editor).
To view/edit and remove audio file metadata, use Mp3tag (www.mp3tag.de/en). For 
the video file’s metadata, use MediaInfo (https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo).
To remove metadata from Microsoft Office 2010, 2013, and 2016 documents, you 
can check the document metadata by selecting File and then going to the Info tab. The 
Properties panel will be on the right side; from here you can remove document metadata 
by clicking the Properties button and selecting Advanced Properties (see Figure 2-10).

In Microsoft Office 2007, you need to click the Microsoft Office button and then 
select Prepare ➤ Properties to edit the document metadata.
Another issue you need to consider when sending Microsoft Office documents to 
outside parties is deleting other hidden metadata. Fortunately, Microsoft Office provides 
functionality for deleting hidden metadata. You can access this feature in Microsoft Word 
2010, 2013, and 2016 by selecting File ➤ Info ➤ Check for Issues ➤ Inspect Document. 
In Microsoft Word 2007, you can access this feature by clicking the Office button and 
selecting Prepare ➤ Inspect Document.
 Physically Securing Computing Devices
We already covered different precautionary steps to maintain your privacy, but 
everything is useless if your computing device or hardware (or portable storage units) 
gets stolen or unauthorized physical access takes place while it’s unattended. People 
working to collect OSINT information to investigate crimes and other official issues 
should take extra care to avoid revealing any information about the cases they are 
working on and losing their hardware containing confidential information.

Corporations and government agencies have special policies to quantify the risks 
to IT infrastructure and the possible consequences, in addition to protection measures 
that should be taken to mitigate such risks. Users should follow these guidelines where 
applicable.
Individuals also suffer from physical threats. Theft and hardware defects can prevent 
them from accessing data stored on computing devices in addition to revealing this 
data to unauthorized users. For example, laptops that are left unattended without being 
secured by a cable lock can be quickly stolen. To secure mobile devices, use these tips:
• 
When using your laptop in public places, secure it by using a cable 
lock attached to a heavy object (e.g., desk, table, column in a garden).
• 
Do not leave your office without locking it when you have portable 
devices in it.
• 
Do not store your work’s sensitive files on your computing device 
without proper permission, and make sure to encrypt everything if 
you store such data on your device.
• 
Do not store your sensitive/personal data on mobile devices without 
proper encryption.
• 
Use a password to protect your mobile device from unauthorized 
access.
• 
Do not turn your Bluetooth connection on in public places, and if 
necessary, run it for a short period of time to receive or send urgent 
files.
• 
Turn off Wi-Fi when you are not using it. Be careful when using 
public hotspots and encrypt your connection using a VPN when 
using insecure Internet connections.
• 
Keep a written record of the make, model, serial number, MAC 
address, and other pertinent information about your portable device 
in case it gets stolen.

 Online Tracking Techniques
Web tracking is used to record the web browsing behavior of users when going online. 
This activity is conducted by different parties for different purposes. For instance, social 
sites can track their users across many websites. This information can be later associated 
with each user social account—for example, a Facebook account—to show personalized 
advertisements and services.
In this section, we will introduce you to how online tracking technologies work. This 
knowledge is essential to understanding how you should conceal your identity later to 
avoid being tracked when conducting OSINT searches.
 Tracking Through IP Address
The first technical thing you need to understand is the concept of Internet Protocol (IP). 
It is essential to understand this concept and how devices are connected to the Internet 
because most of the anonymizing techniques work by obscuring your real IP address to 
avoid tracking. Besides, you cannot protect your digital privacy without knowing how 
Internet devices are connected in today’s digital world.
 What Is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique address that computing devices use to connect to the Internet 
and to identify themselves and communicate with other devices in the IP network. This 
address is unique for each device in the IP network; hence, no two devices can have the 
same address within each network.
There are two standards of IP addressing already in use. The IPv4 standard is the 
most widely used one; it can accommodate up to 4.3 billion addresses. Apparently, this 
number is not enough, especially with the explosion use of Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices. This fact has resulted in another standard named IPv6, which can accommodate 
more than 7.9 ×1028 times as many addresses as IPv4.
When connecting to the Internet, you either use the same IP address each time 
(known as static IP) or use a different number each time (known as dynamic IP).
A static IP address is an address that is assigned by your Internet service provider 
(ISP) and does not change over time. This kind of address is usually used by business 
corporations, the public sector, and other IT providers such as email service providers.

53
A dynamic IP address, on the other hand, is assigned dynamically by your ISP each 
time you connect to the Internet. It uses a protocol called Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) to assign new IP addresses whenever you disconnect from the Internet 
or your router gets rebooted.
Note! To determine whether you are assigned a dynamic or static Ip address, 
open a command-line prompt. In Windows 10, press Windows + X and then click 
Command prompt (admin). Type ipconfig /all and then press the enter key. locate 
the line containing “dHCp enabled” under your current network connection. If 
dHCp enabled is set to Yes (see Figure 2-11), then you most likely have a dynamic 
internal Ip address.
Figure 2-11. Determine whether your PC is using a dynamic or static IP address. 
In this case, we’re using a dynamic IP address.
IP addresses come in two types: public and private IP addresses. A public IP 
address allows direct access to the Internet. A private IP address is a non-Internet- 
facing IP address on an internal network and is used to assign a private number to your 
computing devices in your home or office network to avoid exposing them directly 
online. For example, you can have one public IP address assigned to your router on 
your office network, and each of the computers, tablets, smartphones, and peripherals 
connected to your router (via a wired connection or Wi-Fi) get a private IP address from 
your router via DHCP.

54
Note! dHCp is a network protocol used on Ip networks. It works by dynamically 
allocating Ip addresses to a set of connected hosts based on a preconfigured pool 
of addresses.
 How Is an IP Address Used to Track You Online?
Whenever you visit a website, conduct a search online, or access your social site account, 
your connection IP address will be made available to the connected site. Nearly all 
websites record their visitors’ IP addresses among other details such as date/time of the 
visit, pages visited and duration, user actions on the website, and much more. Knowing 
the IP address is also—almost—enough to figure out approximately your current 
geographical location.
Your ISP will also record your IP address. ISPs usually record the browsing history 
of their users and connect it with each user’s real identity (ISPs usually request a valid 
government ID to provide Internet connections for their customers).
Social sites—like Facebook and Twitter—track their users’ browsing history across 
many websites. For instance, Facebook’s Like and Share buttons and Twitter’s Tweet 
buttons are used to track a user’s online activities even if the user does not click them. All 
this information is stored in a separate log attached with each user’s social account ID—
Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter—to better target the user with customized ads. Storing 
such logs is dangerous because all your web searches and web history get connected 
to your real name. Many WikiLeaks revelations mention that intelligence agencies 
have different facilities to access giant IT providers’ user. Giant corporations are also 
interested in such data to exploit it for commercial gain. This means all your sensitive 
details will be exposed in one way or another.
Although tracking online users through their IP addresses is still the most prevalent 
method used by different actors, there are other advanced technical techniques that 
allow an outside observer to track a user’s online activities even without knowing the 
user’s IP address, and this what we will talk about in the coming section.

 Cookies
Cookies are small text files usually stored on the client computer’s browser. A cookie 
file contains information that is specific to a client computer in addition to the website 
name, expiry date, and a user ID number to distinguish the user from other visitors. 
Cookies allow a website owner to be able to recognize the visitor’s browser the next time, 
effectively allowing the website to offer a customized experience for its visitors.
Mainly there are two types of cookies already in use: session cookies and persistent 
cookies.
Session cookies are stored in a temporary location in the client browser and are 
removed when the user closes the web browser or logs out of the current session. Such 
cookies are usually used to remember user shopping cart information or to store data 
between multiple pages.
Note! most websites plant HTTp cookies to track site visitors or to remember 
a user’s credentials. This kind is less risky than persistent cookies and can be 
removed safely by using the standard browser function remove Cookies.
Persistent cookies come in two main types: flash cookies and ever cookies. Persistent 
cookies are more persistent than HTTP cookies and contain information from other 
websites that is used to track a user’s online activities across multiple websites. With 
flash cookies, a cookie is stored within a specific folder on a client hard drive (not within 
the client browser like HTTP cookies). In other words, such cookies will not get removed 
when you use the standard Remove Cookies browser function. For security reasons, it is 
highly advisable to deactivate this kind of cookie and delete the currently installed one. 
You can achieve this by going to Control Panel ➤ Flash Player and selecting the option 
“Block all sites from storing information on this computer” (see Figure 2-12).

Note! FlashCookiesView (www.nirsoft.net/utils/flash_cookies_view.
html) is a small utility created by NirSoft that allows you to display a list of Flash 
cookies that exist on your system and delete them.
An ever cookie is another type of persistent cookies. This type of cookie is a 
JavaScript-based cookie that can survive even after the user deletes HTTP and Flash 
cookies from their machine. Fortunately, the browsers and anti-malware software 
applications that exist today are now able to detect and block ever cookies.
Note! You should disable Java plug-ins or at least to set their security settings to 
a high level. To do so, select Control panel ➤ Java; then go to the Security tab and
