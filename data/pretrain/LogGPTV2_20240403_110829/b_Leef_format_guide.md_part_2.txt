### EventID and QID Map
The `EventID` is used to define the low-level event. This becomes particularly important when the `EventID` does not match any value in the QID map. In such cases, QRadar can use the category and other keys to further determine the general nature of the event. This "fallback" mechanism prevents events from being identified as unknown, allowing QRadar to categorize them based on the known information from the key attribute fields in the event payload. For example:
```
LEEF:1.0|Microsoft|Endpoint|2015|Conficker_worm|cat=Detected
```

### devTime and devTimeFormat
- **devTime**: This key represents the raw event date and time generated by the appliance or application that provides the LEEF event.
  - **Normalized Event Field?**: Yes
  - **Description**: QRadar uses the `devTime` key, along with `devTimeFormat`, to identify and properly format the event time.
  - **Usage**:
    - If `devTime` is an epoch value (10 or 13 digits), a `devTimeFormat` string is not required.
    - Otherwise, both `devTime` and `devTimeFormat` must be used together to ensure accurate parsing by QRadar.
  - **Priority**: When present in the event payload, `devTime` is used to identify the event time, even if the syslog header contains a date and time stamp. The syslog header's date and time stamp is a fallback identifier, but `devTime` is the preferred method for event time identification.

- **devTimeFormat**:
  - **Value Type**: String
  - **Normalized Event Field?**: No
  - **Description**: Applies formatting to the raw date and time of the `devTime` key.
  - **Requirement**: This key is required if your event log contains `devTime`. For more information, see “Custom event date format” on page 9.

### Custom Event Keys
Vendors and partners can define their own custom event keys and include them in the LEEF payload. Use custom key-value pairs when there is no default key to represent specific information about an event. For example, if your appliance monitors access, you may need to include the file name accessed by a user, where no such attribute exists in LEEF by default.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and avoid tab, pipe, or caret delimiters in your event payload keys and values.
  - Ensure each key is a single word.
  - Avoid using the same name as a predefined LEEF key.
  - Make key values human-readable to facilitate event investigation.

### Custom Event Date Format
To create a customized event format, your device must supply the raw date format using the `devTime` event attribute in the payload. Use the `devTimeFormat` to format the `devTime` attribute for display in IBM Security QRadar.

| `devTimeFormat` Pattern | Result                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss`  | `Jun 06 2015 16:07:36`         |
| `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS` | `Jun 06 2015 16:07:36.300`     |
| `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS z` | `Jun 06 2015 02:07:36.300 GMT` |

For more information about specifying a date format, refer to the `SimpleDateFormat` documentation on the Java Web Page.
