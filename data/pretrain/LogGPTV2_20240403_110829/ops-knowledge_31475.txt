Assistant: At 17-06-09 20:10:57, the system began reading broadcast variable 33, which took 9 ms. It stored the block broadcast_33_piece0 and broadcast_33 in memory, estimated at 29.5 KB and 82.1 KB respectively. It also found blocks rdd_6_4, rdd_6_3, rdd_6_2, rdd_6_1, and rdd_6_0 locally. The File Output Committer Algorithm version was set to 1 and the PythonRunner reported times for total, boot, init, and finish. Finally, the output of task 'attempt_201706092018_0024_m_000003_1012' was saved to hdfs://10.10.34.11:9000/pjhe/test/1/_temporary/0/task_201706092018_0024_m_000003_1012.
