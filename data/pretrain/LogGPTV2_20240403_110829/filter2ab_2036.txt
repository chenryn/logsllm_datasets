### Title: Eternal War in XNU Kernel Objects: A Deep Dive into Jailbreaking and Mitigation Strategies

**Abstract:**

Jailbreaking, in essence, involves liberating a device from its "jail." Apple devices, such as iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, are among the most well-known targets for jailbreaking. These devices run on operating systems developed by Apple Inc., including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, all of which utilize a hybrid kernel called XNU.

To achieve a jailbreak, attackers must patch the kernel to disable its security measures. A crucial step in this process is gaining stable, arbitrary read and write access to kernel memory through the exploitation of vulnerabilities. However, it is a widely accepted fact that no system is entirely free of flaws. Consequently, Apple continually adds new mitigations to enhance security. Despite these efforts, determined attackers often find ways to bypass these defenses.

In this presentation, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the recently proposed mitigation strategies by Apple. We demonstrate that many of these defenses can be circumvented by corrupting unsafe kernel objects. We categorize this type of attack as IPC Port Kernel Object-Oriented Programming (PKOOP). Specifically, we present realistic attack scenarios that allow full control over the latest version of the XNU kernel.

To counter PKOOP attacks, we propose the XNU Kernel Object Protector (XKOP), a framework designed to significantly reduce the number of potential targets for unprotected kernel objects. XKOP hooks related system calls to check the integrity of risky kernel objects without modifying the system. We believe that our assessment and the XKOP framework provide valuable contributions to the design and implementation of a more secure XNU kernel.
