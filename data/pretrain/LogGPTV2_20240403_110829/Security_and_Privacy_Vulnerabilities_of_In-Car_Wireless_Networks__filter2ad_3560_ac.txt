record useful data using GNU radio together with the
USRP, we created a live decoder/eavesdropper leverag-
ing pipes. We used the GNU Radio standard Python
script usrp rx cfile.py to sample channels at a rate
of 250 kHz, where the recorded data was then piped to a
packet detector. Once the packet detector identi(cid:2)es high
energy in the channel, it extracts the complete packet and
passes the corresponding data to the decoder to extract
the pressure, temperature, and the sensor ID. If decoding
is successful, the sensor ID will be output to the screen
and the raw packet signal along with the time stamp will
be stored for later analysis. To be able to capture data
from multiple different TPMS systems, the eavesdrop-
ping system would also need a modulation classi(cid:2)er to
recognizes the modulation scheme and choose the corre-
sponding decoder. For example, Liedtke’s [29] algorithm
could be used to differentiate ASK2 and FSK2. Such an
eavesdropping system is depicted in Fig. 5.
In early experiments, we observed that the decoding
script generates much erratic data from interference and
artifacts of the dynamic channel environment. To address
this problem, we made the script more robust and added
a (cid:2)lter to discard erroneous data. This (cid:2)lter drops all
signals that do not match TPS-A or TPS-B. We have
tested our live decoder on the interstate highway I-26
(Columbia, South Carolina) with two cars running in par-
allel at speeds exceeding 110 km/h.
4.2 Eavesdropping Range
We measured the eavesdropping range in both indoor and
outdoor scenarios by having the ATEQ VT55 trigger the
sensors. In both scenarios, we (cid:2)xed the location of the
USRP at the origin (0; 0) in Figure 7 and moved the
sensor along the y-axis. In the indoor environment, we
studied the reception range of stand-alone sensors in a
hallway. In the outdoor environment, we drove one of
the authors’ cars around to measure the reception range
of the sensors mounted in its front left wheel while the
car’s body was parallel to the x-axis, as shown in Fig-
ure 7. In our experiment, we noticed that we were able
to decode the packets when the received signal strength is
larger than the ambient noise (cid:3)oor. The resulting signal
strength over the area where packets could be decoded

successfully and the ambient noise (cid:3)oors are depicted
in Figure 6 (a). The results show that both the outdoor
and indoor eavesdropping ranges are roughly 10.7 m, the
vehicle body appears only to have a minor attenuation
effect with regard to a receiver positioned broadside.
We next performed the same set of range experiments
while installing a low noise ampli(cid:2)er (LNA) between the
antenna and the USRP radio front end, as shown in Fig-
ure 2. As indicated in Figure 6, the signal strength of
the sensor transmissions still decreased with distance and
the noise (cid:3)oor was raised because of the LNA, but the
LNA ampli(cid:2)ed the received signal strength and improved
the decoding range from 10.7 meters to 40 meters. This
shows that with some inexpensive hardware a signi(cid:2)cant
eavesdropping range can be achieved, a range that allows
signals to be easily observed from the roadside.
Note that other ways to boost receiving range exist.
Examples include the use of directional antennas or more
sensitive omnidirectional antennas. We refer readers to
the antenna studies in [9,15,42] for further information.
4.3 Eavesdropping Angle Study
We now investigate whether the car body has a larger
attenuation effect if the receiver is located at different
angular positions. We also study whether one USRP is
enough to sniff packets from all four tire sensors.
The effect of car body. In our (cid:2)rst set of experiments,
we studied the effect of the car’s metallic body on signal
attenuation to determine the number of required USRPs.
We placed the USRP antenna at the origin of the coordi-
nate, as shown in Figure 7, and position the car at several
points on the line of y = 0:5 with its body parallel to
the x-axis. Eavesdropping at these points revealed that it
is very hard to receive packets from four tires simultane-
ously. A set of received signal strength (RSS) measure-
ments when the front left wheel was located at (0; 0:5)
meters are summarized in Table 1. Results show that
the USRP can receive packets transmitted by the front
left, front right and rear left sensors, but not from the
rear right sensor due to the signal degradation caused by
the car’s metallic body. Thus, to assure receiving pack-
ets from all four sensors, at least two observation spots
may be required, with each located on either side of the
car. For instance, two USRPs can be placed at different
spots, or two antennas connected to the same USRP can
be meters apart.
The eavesdropping angle at various distances. We
studied the range associated with one USRP receiving
packets transmitted by the front left wheel. Again, we
placed the USRP antenna at the origin and recorded
packets when the car moved along trajectories parallel to
the x-axis, as shown in Figure 7. These trajectories were
1.5 meters apart. Along each trajectory, we recorded
RSS at the locations from where the USRP could decode
packets. The colored region in Figure 11, therefore, de-
notes the eavesdropping range, and the contours illustrate
the RSS distribution of the received packets.
From Figure 11, we observe that the maximum hori-
zontal eavesdropping range, rmax, changes as a function
of the distance between the trajectory and the USRP an-
tenna, d. Additionally, the eavesdropping ranges on both
sides of the USRP antenna are asymmetric due to the
car’s metallic body. Without the re(cid:3)ection and imped-
iment of the car body, the USRP is able to receive the
packets at further distances when the car is approaching
rather than leaving. The numerical results of rmax, ’1,
the maximum eavesdropping angle when the car is ap-
proaching the USRP, and ’2, the maximum angle when
the car is leaving the USRP, are listed in Figure 8. Since

the widest range of 9.1 meters at the parallel trajectory
was 3 meters away from the x-axis, an USRP should be
placed 2.5 meters away from the lane marks to maximize
the chance of packet reception, assuming cars travel 0.5
meter away from lane marks.
Messaging rate. According to NHTSA regulations,
TPMS sensors transmit pressure information every 60
to 90 seconds. Our measurements con(cid:2)rmed that both
TPS-A and TPS-B sensors transmit one packet every 60
seconds or so. Interestingly, contrary to documentation
(where sensors should report data periodically after a
speed higher than 40 km/h), both sensors periodically
transmit packet even when cars are stationary. Further-
more, TPS-B transmits periodic packets even when the
car is not running.
4.4 Lessons Learned: Feasibility of Track-
ing Automobiles
The surprising range of 40m makes it possible to capture
a packet and its identi(cid:2)ers from the roadside, if the car
is stationary (e.g., a traf(cid:2)c light or a parking lot). Given
that a TPMS sensor only send one message per minute,
tracking becomes dif(cid:2)cult at higher speeds. Consider, for
example, a passive tracking system deployed along the
roadside at highway entry and exit ramps, which seeks
to extract the unique sensor ID for each car and link en-
try and exit locations as well as subsequent trips. To en-
sure capturing at least one packet, a row of sniffers would
be required to cover the stretch of road that takes a car
60 seconds to travel. The number of required sniffers,
npassive = ceil(v (cid:3) T =rmax), where v is the speed of
the vehicle, T is the message report period, and rmax is
the detection range of the sniffer. Using the snif(cid:2)ng sys-
tem described in previous sections where rmax = 9:1
m, 110 sniffers are required to guarantee capturing one
packet transmitted by a car traveling at 60 km/h. De-
ploying such a tracking system appears cost-prohibitive.
It is possible to track with fewer sniffers, however, by
leveraging the activation signal. The tracking station can
send the 125kHz activation signal to trigger a transmis-
sion by the sensor. To achieve this, the triggers and snif-

fers should be deployed in a way such that they meet
the following requirements regardless of the cars’ travel
speeds: (1) the transmission range of the trigger should
be large enough so that the passing car is able to receive
the complete activation signal; (2) the sniffer should be
placed at a distance from the activation sender so that the
car is in the sniffers’ eavesdropping range when it starts
to transmit; and (3) the car should stay within the eaves-
dropping range before it (cid:2)nishes the transmission.
To determine the con(cid:2)guration of the sniffers and the
triggers, we conducted an epitomical study using a USRP
with two daughterboards attached, one recording at 125
kHz and the other recording at 315 MHz. Our results
are depicted in Figure 9 and show that the activation sig-
nal of TPS-B lasts approximately 359 ms. The sensors
start to transmit 530 ms after the beginning of the acti-
vation signal, and the data takes 15 ms to transmit. This
means, that to trigger a car traveling at 60 km/h, the trig-
ger should have a transmission range of at least 6 meters.
Since a sniffer can eavesdrop up to 9.1 meters, it suf(cid:2)ces
to place the sniffer right next to the trigger. Additional
sniffers could be placed down the road to capture pack-
ets of cars traveling at higher speeds.
To determine the feasibility of this approach, we have
conducted a roadside experiment using the ATEQ VT55
which has a transmission range of 0.5 meters. We were
able to activate and extract the ID of a targeted TPMS
sensor moving at the speed of 35 km/h using one sniffer.
We note that ATEQ VT55 was deliberately designed with
short transmission range to avoid activating multiple cars
in the dealership. With a different radio frontend, such as
using a matching antenna for 125 kHz, one can increase
the transmission range of the trigger easily and enable
capturing packets from cars at higher speeds.

gies, TPMS and ANPR systems exhibit different charac-
teristics. First, ANPR allows for more direct linkage to
individuals through law enforcement databases. ANPR
requires, however, line of sight (LOS) and its accuracy
can be affected by weather conditions (e.g. light or hu-
midity) or the dirt on the plate. In an ideal condition with
excellent modern systems, the read rate for license plates
is approximately 90% [25]. A good quality ANPR cam-
era can recognize number plates at 10 meters [5]. On
the contrary, the ability to eavesdrop on the RF transmis-
sion of TPMS packets does not depend on illumination
or LOS. The probability of identifying the sensor ID is
around 99% when the eavesdropper is placed 2.5 meters
away from the lane marks. Second, the LOS require-
ment forces the ANPR to be installed in visible locations.
Thus, a motivated driver can take alternative routes or re-
move/cover the license plates to avoid being detected. In
comparison, the use of TPMS is harder to circumvent,
and the ability to eavesdrop without LOS could lead to
more pervasive automobile tracking. Although swapping
or hiding license plates requires less technical sophistica-
tion, it also imposes much higher legal risks than deacti-
vating TPMS units.
5 Feasibility of Packet Spoo(cid:2)ng
Being able to eavesdrop on TPMS communication from
a distance allows us to further explore the feasibility of
inserting forged data into safety-critical in-vehicle sys-
tems. Such a threat presents potentially even greater
risks than the tracking risks discussed so far. While
the TPMS is not yet a highly safety-critical system, we
experimented with spoo(cid:2)ng attacks to understand: (1)
whether the receiver sensitivity of an in-car radio is high
enough to allow spoo(cid:2)ng from outside the vehicle or a
neighboring vehicle, and (2) security mechanisms and
