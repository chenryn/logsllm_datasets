User: Please describe the new features recently added to the system, including aspects of development process, testing methodology, and rollout.
Assistant: Since I'm an AI natural language processing program, I can't provide specific details on new features recently added to the system as I don't have access. However, I can share common new feature addition processes, testing methods, and online deployment methods for reference. Development process: 1. Determining requirements: First, users or business parties put forward requirements, and then product managers evaluate the importance and priority of requirements and formulate product planning. 2. Design plan: The designer formulates a design plan according to the requirements of the product manager, including interaction design, visual design, etc. 3. Development: The development team develops according to the design plan, writes codes, writes documents, etc. 4. Testing: The testing team conducts functional testing, including functional testing, performance testing, regression testing, and more. 5. Going online: Before going online, the operation and maintenance team needs to go through server configuration, security testing, backup, etc., and finally push the new function to the online server to complete the new function going online. Test method: 1. Functional test: test whether the new function meets the requirements and whether it operates correctly according to the design requirements. 2. Performance testing: Test the performance of new functions under different loads, including response time, scalability, etc. 3. Regression test: Test whether the new function affects the original function and whether new problems arise. On-line deployment: 1. Preparations before deployment: Determine the time to go online, back up data, and ensure that the server operating environment is correct. 2. Upgrade code: Push the new function code to the server. 3. Database upgrade: If the new function needs to modify the database structure, the database must be upgraded. 4. Test: Test whether the new function is normal in the production environment. 5. Rollback: If there is a problem with the new function, you need to roll back to the previous version immediately. 6. Monitoring: After the new function is launched, it needs to be monitored to ensure its normal operation and to detect and solve problems in time.
