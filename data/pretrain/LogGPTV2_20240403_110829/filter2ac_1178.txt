### Title: Black Hat US-19: Information Security in the Public Interest

**Abstract:**

Information security has evolved into a critical public policy issue. Key areas such as election security, blockchain, "going dark," the vulnerabilities equities debate, IoT safety, data privacy, algorithmic security and fairness, and critical infrastructure all have significant cybersecurity components. However, despite the importance of technical expertise in shaping effective policies, there is a notable lack of involvement from technologists in these discussions. This situation is unsustainable.

To address this, we need to foster the development of public-interest technologistsâ€”experts from our field who can contribute to policy-making and provide security support to agencies and organizations working for the public good. These technologists should be integrated into various sectors, including government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academia, the media, and private companies. Their presence is increasingly vital for ensuring public safety and enhancing overall social welfare.

This talk will provide an overview of the current state of public-interest technology and propose a path forward for both individual and collective action within our field. The central policy question of the Internet age is: To what extent should technology govern our lives, and under what conditions? It is imperative that we, as technologists, actively participate in this debate.
