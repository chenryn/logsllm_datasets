I get the following compilation error when building pytorch 1.0.0 from source:
> pytorch/third_party/ideep/mkl-
> dnn/src/cpu/jit_avx512_core_u8s8s32x_wino_convolution.cpp:223:41: error:
> assuming signed overflow does not occur when assuming that (X + c) >= X is
> always true [-Werror=strict-overflow]  
>  assert(id_reg_tmp   ^
I worked around this issue by adding:
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wno-strict-overflow")
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wno-error=strict-overflow")
in third_party/ideep/mkl-dnn/CMakeLists.txt before adding the sub directories.  
But I wonder whether there are better ways to solve this error.
System configuration:
Ubuntu 18.04  
Cmake 3.12.4  
CUDA 9.2.148
