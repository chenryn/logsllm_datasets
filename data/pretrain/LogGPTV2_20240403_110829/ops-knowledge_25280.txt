Install Apache: Run the following command to install Apache: ```bash sudo apt -get install apache2 ``` 4. Start Apache: Run the following command to start Apache: ```bash sudo service apache2 start ``` Now the Raspberry Pi is configured as a web server and Apache is installed. 5. Test server: Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. If Apache's default welcome page appears, the server is running successfully. 6. Create a website: To host your own website on the Raspberry Pi, you can upload the website files to the /var/www/html/ directory on the server. Then visit it by opening the website in your browser by typing in the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. With these steps, you can set up your Raspberry Pi as a web server and install Apache.
