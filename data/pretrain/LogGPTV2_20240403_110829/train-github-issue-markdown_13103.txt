**Current behavior**
canDeactivate guard is not called for child components when params change in
parent route.
Given that I have a general layout for a page if I have a user param, When I
change the user while maintaining the subroute for the UserForm, canDeactivate
is not called.
    { path: ':id', component: UserLayout,
        children: [ 
            { path: 'edit', component: UserForm, canDeactivate: [CanDeactivateUserForm] }
            { path: 'favorites', ... },
            { path: 'commments', ... } 
        ]
    }
If I put the `canDeactivate` on the `:id` path, the method is called, however
the `component` I receive as the first parameter in the `canDeactivate` method
is not the `UserForm` component, but the `UserLayout`.
**Expected behavior**
Expected behavior would be either to implement a `canDeactivateChild` similar
to `canActivateChild` that is called on the subroutes if the parent route
changes or have the children's `canDeactivate` calls trigger when a parent
route changes.
Another alternative would be to make its usage similar to the way it worked
before RC.5, where `canDeactivate` can be directly implemented on the
`UserForm` class.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
Here is a minimal plunker demonstrating the issue. When you navigate to the a
user, the `EditInfo` form is currently the only subroute of `UserDetail` (for
brevety), but you could imagine other routes. The `canDeactivate` is attached
to this route but when you click on another user, we want to still maintain
the editing page, however, `canDeactivate` is not called.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
So we can check with the user before navigating away from an unfinished form.
