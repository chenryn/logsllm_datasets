### OpenDNS Presentation
#### Catching Malware DNS Style
- **Crimeware Ecosystem (DNS Style)**
  - Investigation Process
    - Zbot Fast Flux Proxy Network
    - Tracking Command and Control (CnC) Servers with Hadoop and Streaming DNS
    - Identifying Malware Phoning to CnCs
    - Example: Pony Panel on Proxy Network
  - **Fast Flux Networks**
    - A DNS-based redundancy/evasion technique where a domain resolves to multiple IPs, ASNs, and countries with a relatively low TTL.
    - Examples: Trojan CnCs, spam, scam, pharmacy, and dating domains.
  - **Zeus Crimeware**
    - Configuration Files, Web Injects, Zeus Builder, Binary Files, and Control Panels.
    - Timeline and CnC URLs.
    - Detection Methods:
      1. Periodic Batch Pig Job (Hadoop Script)
      2. IP Harvesting + Streaming Authoritative DNS + Filtering Heuristics
  - **Detection with Hadoop**
    - Extracts domains with TTL = 150.
    - Builds a "domain to IP" bipartite graph.
    - Identifies new Zbot CnCs to block.
  - **Authoritative DNS Stream**
    - Processes 100s to 1000s of entries per second.
    - Implements custom filters and detection heuristics.
    - Faster than DNSDB on Hadoop.
  - **Detection with DNS Stream**
    - Seeds known Zbot CnCs.
    - Harvests IPs and adds them to the pool.
    - Extracts domains with IP or NS_IP in the Zbot IP pool.
    - Adds new Zbot CnCs to the seed.

#### Data Visualization
- **Zbot CnC Domains - IP Bipartite Graph**
  - Workflow using the SemanNet Library.
  - Visualizing Domain-IP Over Time.
  - Results for various malware types (Zeus, Citadel, KINS, Ice IX, Asprox, etc.).
  - Discovery of Pony Panels and their characteristics.
  - TLD Distribution and Geo-Distribution of Bots.
  - Clients Phoning to CnCs.
  - CnC Domains and Related Samples.

### Summary
- The Zbot fast flux proxy network is highly versatile and multi-purpose.
- It supports CnCs for various malware, including Zeus, Citadel, Ice IX, Kins, and Asprox.
- Effective detection and visualization techniques are crucial for identifying and mitigating these threats.
