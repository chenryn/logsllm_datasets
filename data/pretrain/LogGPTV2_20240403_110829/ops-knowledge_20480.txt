User: I have some python code with many calls to subprocess (for example, subprocess.check_call()).  It apparently can't debug into the subprocess.
Is there any way (e.g. adding code) to make it do that, or must I use a different debugger?
Assistant: You will have to step through the code if you have a pdb. If you have the source files, leave a breakpoint in the line of your interest and use pdb to automatically stop at your line of interest.
This is what we do in .net. Hopefully it should work for python too..
