# Apply Zero Trust principles to IaaS applications in Amazon Web Services
This article provides steps to apply the principles of Zero Trust to IaaS applications in Amazon Web Services (AWS):
| Zero Trust Principle | Definition | Met by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verify explicitly | Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points. | Security in DevOps (DevSecOps), using GitHub advanced security and DevOps, scans and secures your infrastructure as code. |
| Use least-privilege access | Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection. |  Microsoft Entra Permissions Management detects, right-sizes, and monitors unused and excessive permissions.  Privileged Identity Management (PIM), a service in Microsoft Entra ID P2, allows you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization.  Assign users role-based access control (RBAC) to resources at the repository level, team level, or organization level.  |
| Assume breach | Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses. |  Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Microsoft 365) continuously scan the environment for threats and vulnerabilities.  Microsoft Sentinel analyzes collected data, behavioral trend of entities, anomalies, and multi-stage threats across enterprises to detect suspicious activity, and can respond with automation.  |
For more information about how to apply the principles of Zero Trust across an Azure IaaS environment, see the [Apply Zero Trust principles to Azure IaaS overview](azure-infrastructure-overview.md).
## AWS and AWS components
AWS is one of the public cloud providers available in the market, along with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others. It's common for companies to have a multicloud architecture that consists of more than one cloud provider. In this article, we focus on a multicloud architecture where:
- Azure and AWS are integrated to run workloads and IT business solutions.
- You secure an AWS IaaS workload using Microsoft products.
AWS virtual machines, called Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), run on top of an AWS virtual network, called Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). Users and cloud administrators set up an Amazon VPC in their AWS environment and add Amazon EC2 virtual machines.
AWS CloudTrail logs AWS account activity in the AWS environment. Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC, and AWS CloudTrail are common in AWS environments. Collecting logs from these services is essential to understanding what is going on in your AWS environment and the actions to take to avoid or mitigate attacks.
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that helps to protect AWS workloads by monitoring the AWS environment for malicious activities and unauthorized behavior.
In this article, you learn how to integrate monitoring and logging of these AWS resources and services with Azure's monitoring solutions and the Microsoft security stack.
## Reference Architecture
The following architecture diagram shows the common services and resources needed to run an IaaS workload in an AWS environment. The diagram also shows the Azure services needed to ingest logs and data from the AWS environment into Azure and to provide threat monitoring and protection.
:::image type="content" source="media/zero-trust-azure-aws-illustration.svg" alt-text="Diagram of the reference architecture for securing IaaS applications in Amazon Web Services (AWS)." lightbox="media/zero-trust-azure-aws-illustration.svg":::
The diagram demonstrates ingestion of logs into Azure for the following resources and services in the AWS environment:
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
- Amazon Web Services CloudTrail (AWS CloudTrail)
- Amazon GuardDuty
To ingest logs into Azure for the resources and services in the AWS environment, you must have Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) defined.
Logs and data are ingested into Log Analytics in Azure Monitor.
The following Microsoft products use the ingested data to monitor:
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
>[!Note]
>You don't have to ingest logs into all of the Microsoft products listed to monitor your AWS resources and services. Using all of the Microsoft products together, though, provides greater benefit from AWS log and data ingestion into Azure.
>
This article follows the architecture diagram and describes how to:
- Install and configure the Microsoft products to ingest logs from your AWS resources.
- Configure metrics for the security data that you want to monitor.
- Improve your overall security posture and secure the AWS workload.
- Secure Infrastructure as code.
## Step 1: Install and connect Microsoft products to ingest logs and data
This section walks you through how to install and connect the Microsoft products in the referenced architecture to ingest logs from your AWS and Amazon services and resources. To adhere to the Zero Trust **verify explicitly** principle, you need to install Microsoft products and connect to your AWS environment to take proactive actions before an attack.
| Steps | Task |
| --- | --- |
| A | Install Azure Connected Machine agent on to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) virtual machines to ingest operating system data and logs into Azure. |
| B | Install Azure Monitor Agent on to Amazon EC2 virtual machines to send logs to your Log Analytics workspace. |
| C | Connect an AWS account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. |
| D | Connect Microsoft Sentinel to AWS to ingest AWS log data. |
| E | Use the AWS connectors to pull AWS service logs into Microsoft Sentinel. |
### A. Install Azure Connected Machine agent on to your Amazon EC2 virtual machines to ingest operating system data and logs into Azure
[Azure Arc-enabled servers](/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview) let you manage Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure, on your corporate network, or other cloud provider. For the purposes of Azure Arc, machines hosted outside of Azure are considered hybrid machines. To connect your Amazon EC2 virtual machines (also known as hybrid machines) to Azure, you install the [Azure Connected Machine agent](/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview) on each machine.
For more information, see [Connect hybrid machines to Azure](/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-portal).
### B. Install Azure Monitor Agent on to Amazon EC2 virtual machines to send logs to your Log Analytics workspace
[Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-multicloud) provides complete monitoring for your resources and applications running in Azure and other clouds, including AWS. Azure Monitor collects, analyzes, and acts on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments. [VM insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview) in Azure Monitor uses Azure Arc-enabled servers to provide a consistent experience between both Azure virtual machines and your Amazon EC2 virtual machines. You can view your Amazon EC2 virtual machines right alongside your Azure virtual machines. You can onboard your Amazon EC2 virtual machines using identical methods. This includes using standard Azure constructs such as Azure Policy and applying tags.
When you enable VM insights for a machine, the [Azure Monitor Agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) (AMA) is installed. AMA collects monitoring data from the Amazon EC2 virtual machines and delivers it to Azure Monitor for use by features, insights, and other services, such as Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
>[!Important]
>Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that you use to edit and run log queries against data in the Azure Monitor Logs store. Log Analytics is automatically installed.
Amazon EC2 virtual machines may have the legacy Log Analytics agent installed. This agent will be deprecated in September 2024. Microsoft recommends installing the new Azure Monitor Agent.
The Log Analytics agent or Azure Monitor Agent for Windows and Linux is required to:
- Proactively monitor the operating system and workloads running on the machine.
- Manage the machine using Automation runbooks or solutions like Update Management.
- Use other Azure services like Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
>
When you collect logs and data, the information is stored in a Log Analytics workspace. You need a Log Analytics workspace if you collect data from Azure resources in your subscription.
Azure Monitor workbooks are a visualization tool available in the Azure portal. Workbooks combine text, log queries, metrics, and parameters into rich interactive reports. Setting up workbooks helps you use analytics to adhere to the Zero Trust **assume breach** principle.
Workbooks are discussed in the next article under Monitor in Microsoft Sentinel logs from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty.
For more information, see:
- [Install AMA through data collection rules](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview) in Azure Monitor
- [Create a Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace)
- [Get started with Azure workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-getting-started)
### C. Connect an AWS account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) for all your Azure, on-premises, and multicloud resources, including AWS. Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs as you manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises:
- Continuously assess - Know your security posture. Identify and track vulnerabilities.
- Secure - Harden resources and services with the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) (MCSB) and [AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/getting-started/security-hub-fsbp/).
- Defend - Detect and resolve threats to resources and services.
Microsoft Defender for Servers is one of the paid plans provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Defender for Servers extends protection to your Windows and Linux machines that run in Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and on-premises. Defender for Servers integrates with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to provide endpoint detection and response (EDR) and other threat protection features.
For more information, see:
- [Connect an AWS account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws) to protect your AWS resources.
- [Select a Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan#review-plans) to compare different plans offered by Defender for Servers. Defender for Servers automatically provisions the Defender for Endpoint sensor on every supported machine that's connected to Defender for Cloud.
>[!Note]
>If you haven't deployed AMA on your servers yet, you can [deploy the Azure Monitor Agent](/azure/defender-for-cloud/auto-deploy-azure-monitoring-agent) on your servers when you enable Defender for Servers.
>
### D. Connect Microsoft Sentinel to AWS to ingest AWS log data
Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native solution that provides the following services:
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)
Microsoft Sentinel delivers security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise. With Microsoft Sentinel, you get a single solution for attack detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.
For setup instructions, see [Onboard Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard).
### E. Use the AWS connectors to pull AWS service logs into Microsoft Sentinel
To pull the AWS service logs into Microsoft Sentinel, you need to use a Microsoft Sentinel AWS connector. The connector works by granting Microsoft Sentinel access to your AWS resource logs. Setting up the connector establishes a trust relationship between AWS and Microsoft Sentinel. On AWS a role is created that gives permission to Microsoft Sentinel to access your AWS logs.
The AWS connector is available in two versions: the new Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) connector that ingests logs by pulling them from an Amazon S3 bucket and the legacy connector for CloudTrail management and data logs. The Amazon S3 connector can ingest logs from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty. The Amazon S3 connector is in preview. We recommend using the Amazon S3 connector.
To ingest logs from Amazon VPC, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty using the Amazon S3 connector, see [Connect Microsoft Sentinel to AWS](/azure/sentinel/connect-aws).
>[!Note]
>Microsoft recommends using the automatic setup script to deploy the Amazon S3 connector. If you prefer to perform each step manually, then follow the [manual setup](/azure/sentinel/connect-aws#manual-setup) to connect Microsoft Sentinel to AWS.
## Step 2: Configure metrics for your security data
Now that Azure is ingesting logs from your AWS resources, you can create threat detection rules in your environment and monitor alerts. This article walks you through the steps to collect logs and data and monitor for suspicious activity. The Zero Trust **assume breach** principle is achieved by monitoring your environment for threats and vulnerabilities.
| Steps | Task |
| --- | --- |
| A | Collect Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) logs in Azure Monitor. |
| B | View and manage Microsoft Defender for Cloud security alerts and recommendations for Amazon EC2. |
| C | Integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Defender for Cloud. |
| D | Monitor Amazon EC2 data in Microsoft Sentinel. |
| E | Monitor in Microsoft Sentinel logs from Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty. |
| F | Use Microsoft Sentinel built in detection rules to create and investigate threat detection rules in your environment. |
### A. Collect Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) logs in Azure Monitor
The Azure Connected Machine agent installed on your Amazon EC2 VMs enables you to monitor your AWS resources as if they're Azure resources. For example, you can use Azure policies to govern and manage updates to your Amazon EC2 VMs.
The [Azure Monitor Agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) (AMA) installed on your Amazon EC2 VMs collects monitoring data and delivers it to Azure Monitor. These logs become input for Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud.
To collect logs from your Amazon EC2 VMs, see [create data collection rules](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview#create-a-data-collection-rule).
### B. View and manage Microsoft Defender for Cloud security alerts and recommendations for Amazon EC2
Microsoft Defender for Cloud uses resource logs to generate security alerts and recommendations. Defender for Cloud can provide alerts to warn you about possible threats on your Amazon EC2 VMs. Alerts are prioritized by severity. Each alert provides details of affected resources, issues, and remediation recommendations.
There are two ways to view recommendations in the Azure portal. In the Defender for Cloud overview page, you view recommendations for the environment you want to improve. On the Defender for Cloud asset inventory page, recommendations are shown according to the affected resource.
To view and manage Amazon EC2 alerts and recommendations:
- Learn about the different types of [alerts available in Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-overview) and how to respond to alerts.
- [Improve your security posture by implementing recommendations](/azure/defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations) from Defender for Cloud.
- Learn how to [access the asset inventory page](/azure/defender-for-cloud/asset-inventory) of Defender for Cloud.
>[!Note]
>[Microsoft cloud security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) (MCSB) includes a collection of high-impact security recommendations you can use to help secure your cloud services in a single or multicloud environment. Microsoft recommends using security benchmarks to help you quickly secure cloud deployments. Learn more about the MCSB.
