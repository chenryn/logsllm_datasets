Abstract—With the rise of IoT botnets, the remediation of
infected devices has become a critical task. As over 87% of
these devices reside in broadband networks, this task will fall
primarily to consumers and the Internet Service Providers. We
present the ﬁrst empirical study of IoT malware cleanup in the
wild – more speciﬁcally, of removing Mirai
infections in the
network of a medium-sized ISP. To measure remediation rates,
we combine data from an observational study and a randomized
controlled trial involving 220 consumers who suffered a Mirai
infection together with data from honeypots and darknets. We
ﬁnd that quarantining and notifying infected customers via a
walled garden, a best practice from ISP botnet mitigation for
conventional malware, remediates 92% of the infections within
14 days. Email-only notiﬁcations have no observable impact
compared to a control group where no notiﬁcations were sent. We
also measure surprisingly high natural remediation rates of 58-
74% for this control group and for two reference networks where
users were also not notiﬁed. Even more surprising, reinfection
rates are low. Only 5% of the customers who remediated suffered
another infection in the ﬁve months after our ﬁrst study. This
stands in contrast to our lab tests, which observed reinfection
of real IoT devices within minutes – a discrepancy for which
we explore various different possible explanations, but ﬁnd no
satisfactory answer. We gather data on customer experiences
and actions via 76 phone interviews and the communications
logs of the ISP. Remediation succeeds even though many users
are operating from the wrong mental model – e.g., they run anti-
virus software on their PC to solve the infection of an IoT device.
While quarantining infected devices is clearly highly effective,
future work will have to resolve several remaining mysteries.
Furthermore, it will be hard to scale up the walled garden solution
because of the weak incentives of the ISPs.

INTRODUCTION
Events of the past two years have made it abundantly clear
that Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being compromised
at scale, especially in the consumer space. It is also clear
that this situation will not improve in the short term. Due
to lack of effective regulations, poorly-secured devices will
keep ﬂooding the market. Given the life cycle of the existing
and new devices, this means we will be confronted with IoT
botnets for years to come.
All this presents us with a critical challenge: how can
we remediate the population of vulnerable and compromised
IoT devices? Since most of the compromised devices are
consumer products,
this implies overcoming a number of
unsolved problems. A recent study into Mirai [1] identiﬁed
three critical challenges. First, there is no public information
to identify the owner of the device. Second,
there is no
established communication channel to reach the owner. Third,
where owners are reachable, we do not know how to provide
them with an actionable notiﬁcation. There is often no clear
and simple remediation path. In fact, in many cases we cannot
even state exactly which of the owner’s devices is actually
affected.
For the ﬁrst
two problems,
identifying and contacting
owners, we can turn to an existing arrangement: botnet mit-
igation by Internet Service Providers. Many of the devices
are in access networks, so ISPs can identify and contact the
customers who own them. For regular PC-based malware,
botnet mitigation by ISPs is widely accepted and has met with
some success [3]. However, cleaning up infected devices is
still an open problem, even when considering conventional
malware. Years of usability research have shown just how
hard it is to support end users with little technical expertise
in protecting and remediating their personal computers [15].
In the IoT space, all of this becomes much harder. User
intuitions (‘folk models’ [34]) about security are even less
aligned with the IoT environment. Furthermore, the actions
users need to take are different across devices, vendors and
local conﬁgurations. Finally, contrary to conventional malware,
there are no automated tools to support users in protecting and
remediating infected devices. In short, we have no clue whether
owners can act at all effectively on the kind of notiﬁcations
that we can currently provide them with.

We present the ﬁrst empirical study of the cleanup of
compromised IoT in the wild. For this, we collaborate with a
mid-sized ISP that notiﬁes Mirai-infected customers via email
or by placing their connection in a quarantine network – a so-
called ‘walled garden’. We measured the remediation rate and
speed of 220 users in an observational study and a randomized
controlled experiment by tracking the infections in darknet,
honeypot and abuse reporting data. We combined this with
additional scan data to identify the type of devices that are
affected. Next, we studied the user experience by conducting
76 phone interviews and analyzing the logs of the users’
communications with the ISP. Finally, we also conducted lab
tests with real IoT devices to observe the effectiveness of
removal actions and to measure reinfection speed.
In short, we make the following contributions:
• We show that over 87% of all Mirai-infected IoT de-
vices reside in broadband access networks, underlining
the critical role of ISPs in IoT botnet mitigation.
• We provide the ﬁrst real-world measurement of re-
mediation rates for Mirai-infected devices and ﬁnd
that quarantining and notifying affected customers
remediates 92% of the infections.
• We ﬁnd very high natural remediation rates of 58-74%
in the control group and in two reference networks
where no notiﬁcations were sent, probably reﬂecting
the non-persistent nature of the malware.
• We ﬁnd a remarkably low reinfection rate. Only 5%
of the customers who remediated suffered another
infection in the ﬁve months after our ﬁrst study. This
highlights the effectiveness of the countermeasures
taken by the infected customers but stands in contrast
to our lab tests, which found very fast reinfections of
real IoT devices.
Remediation succeeds even though customer inter-
views and communications show that many users
are operating from the wrong mental model – e.g.,
they run anti-virus software on their PC to solve the
infection of an IoT device.
•
Combining insights on the location of compromised IoT
devices, effectiveness of different treatments and the experi-
ence of real-world users, we contribute scientiﬁc evidence for
establishing industry best practices around the remediation of
compromised IoT.
II.
ISP BOTNET MITIGATION
Cleaning up infected IoT devices can be seen as the next
phase of a long-standing challenge: ﬁghting botnets. Over the
past decade, mitigation of PC-based malware has consisted of
two complementary approaches: taking down the command-
and-control infrastructure and cleaning up the infected hosts.
Cleanup is an arduous process that demands efforts from
different actors, such as operating system vendors, anti-virus
vendors, ISPs and the affected end users. As most infected
machines reside in consumer broadband networks [3], the role
of ISPs has become more salient over time. A range of best
practices and codes of conduct have been published by leading
industry associations [21], [23], public-private initiatives [18],
[11] and governmental entities [17], [12]. These documents
share a common set of recommendations for ISPs around
educating customers, detecting infections, notifying customers,
and remediating infections.
While the existing mitigation practices of ISP are exclu-
sively focused on PC-based malware, they might still provide
a good starting point for the remediation of compromised IoT.
This assumes, however, that the bulk of the devices reside
in the networks of broadband consumer ISPs. To test this
assumption, we analyzed the location of compromised devices.
First, following the approach of Antonakakis et al. [1], we
used darknet data to observe the location of devices infected
with a version of Mirai. Darknets, also known as network
telescopes, are routed but unused IP address ranges. They pas-
sively monitor all arriving trafﬁc at these ranges. We leverage
observations from a darknet of approximately 300, 000 IPv4
addresses, spanning 40 networks in 15 countries. As Mirai
malware displays worm-like behavior, actively scanning the
Internet for spreading itself, we can track its presence in the
darknet data. We use data collected in the period January 2016
to April 2018.
integer – equal
We measured per protocol –i.e., per destination port–
in
how many IP addresses were scanning at any point
time. To distinguish Mirai
trafﬁc from backscatter trafﬁc
and other scanning activity, we uniquely ﬁngerprinted Mi-
rai probes based on an artifact of Mirai’s stateless scan-
ning, where every probe has a TCP sequence number –
normally a random 32-bit
to the destina-
tion IP address. We observed over 96 million IP addresses.
Figure 1 shows how they are distributed over six proto-
cols: 23/TCP (Telnet), 2323/TCP (Telnet), 5358/TCP (Telnet),
5555/TCP (TR-069/TR-064), 6789/TCP (Telnet), 7547/TCP
(TR-069/TR-064), 23231/TCP (Telnet), 37777/TCP (UPnP),
22/TCP (SSH), 2222/TCP (SSH), 80/TCP (HTTP), 81/TCP
(HTTP), 88/TCP (HTTP), 8000/TCP (HTTP), 8080/TCP
(HTTP), and 53869/TCP (Realtek SDK Miniigd). Since Mi-
rai’s source code was publicly released, it expanded from
targeting telnet to other ports. While port 23 is the second
most targeted port, HTTP-related ports have become the main
vector – i.e., IoT devices with default credentials for HTTP-
related services.

Next, we mapped these IP addresses to broadband con-
sumer ISPs and other network types. We use the same ap-
proach as a study on ‘regular’ botnet mitigation by broadband
ISPs, where a mapping had been developed to identify the
Autonomous System Number (ASN) of broadband ISPs in 82
countries [3]. The mapping is organized around ground truth
data in the form of a highly accurate commercial database;
TeleGeography Globalcomms [29], containing market data
on the broadband ISPs in 211 countries. In total, 2, 050
ASNs have been labeled manually as belonging to one of
the consumer broadband ISPs or to another category: mobile
provider, another type of ISP (e.g., business provider), hosting,
governmental, educational and other types of networks. Table I

(87.61%) are located in ISP broadband networks, while less
than 1% reside in other types of networks including hosting,
education or governmental networks.

III. PARTNER ISP REMEDIATION PROCESS
Now that we have established that ISPs are in a crucial
position to remediate IoT botnets, even more so than for PC-
based botnets, the question becomes: what can they realisti-
cally do? To answer this question, we have collaborated closely
with a medium-sized European ISP with several million cus-
tomers. The ISP decided to include an abuse feed with Mirai-
infected hosts, reported by Shadowserver, in their existing
botnet notiﬁcation and remediation process.
At the heart of the ISP’s process is an industry best practice:
placing an infected machine into a quarantine network, a
so-called walled garden [24]. There are different ways of
implementing walled gardens to ﬁght malware infections.
RFC6561 [21] describes two types: leaky, an implementation
that permits access to all Internet resources, except
those
that are deemed malicious; and strict, an implementation that
restricts almost all services, except those on a whitelist. Our
partner ISP has implemented a strict version for its consumer
broadband subscribers. The walled garden only allows access
to 41 white-listed domains, which provide cleanup tools, anti-
virus solutions, Microsoft updates, webmail, online banking
and a forum for elderly people.
Besides keeping the infected users safely in quarantine,
the walled garden also plays an important role in notifying
the user. When the user tries to browse the Web, she or he
will be redirected to a landing page with a notiﬁcation about
the infection and advice on how to clean it up. The same
information is also sent by email to the customers. Whereas
emails with the same content can be ignored relatively easily,
the walled garden notiﬁcation cannot.
Next to its own brand, the ISP also provides services to
broadband consumers via a subsidiary brand that is targeting
the cheaper end of the market. Customers of the subsidiary
brand are not quarantined. Notiﬁcations are less common and
conducted only via email. The ISP also sells subscriptions in
the business and mobile service networks. These customers
are never quarantined and do not receive IoT related security
notiﬁcations.
The notiﬁcation and remediation process starts when an
infection is reported in one of the trusted abuse feeds that the
ISP receives. For IoT malware, the ISP uses the daily Shad-
owserver Drone feeds [26]. These include infections labeled as
Mirai. The infected machines are discovered through a range of
methods, including monitoring sinkhole trafﬁc and malicious
scans to honeypots. If an IP address in the report belongs
to one of its consumer broadband subscribers, then the ISP
places the connection of that customer in the walled garden. It
also sends an accompanying email with the same information.
Occasionally, e.g., when the walled garden is full, the ISP
sends an email-only notiﬁcation about the infection.
Once customers are notiﬁed via the walled garden, they
have three ways of getting out of the quarantine environment.
First, they can release themselves by ﬁlling out the form on
the landing page and report how they have ﬁxed the problem.
Submitting the form immediately restores the connection. This
option is revoked after two subsequent quarantine events within
30 days, to avoid customers using this route without making
