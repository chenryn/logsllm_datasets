## Abstract
With the rise of IoT botnets, the remediation of infected devices has become a critical task. As over 87% of these devices reside in broadband networks, this task primarily falls to consumers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This paper presents the first empirical study of IoT malware cleanup in the wild, specifically focusing on removing Mirai infections in the network of a medium-sized ISP. To measure remediation rates, we combined data from an observational study and a randomized controlled trial involving 220 consumers who suffered a Mirai infection, along with data from honeypots and darknets. We found that quarantining and notifying infected customers via a walled garden, a best practice from ISP botnet mitigation for conventional malware, remediates 92% of the infections within 14 days. Email-only notifications had no observable impact compared to a control group where no notifications were sent. Surprisingly, natural remediation rates were high at 58-74% for the control group and two reference networks where users were not notified. Reinfection rates were low, with only 5% of customers suffering another infection in the five months following our initial study. This stands in contrast to lab tests, which observed reinfections of real IoT devices within minutes. We gathered data on customer experiences and actions through 76 phone interviews and communications logs from the ISP. Remediation succeeded even though many users operated under incorrect mental models, such as running antivirus software on their PC to solve the infection of an IoT device. While quarantining infected devices is highly effective, future work must address several remaining mysteries and the scalability of the walled garden solution due to weak ISP incentives.

## I. Introduction
Recent events have made it clear that Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being compromised at scale, particularly in the consumer space. This situation is unlikely to improve in the short term due to the lack of effective regulations, allowing poorly-secured devices to continue flooding the market. Given the lifecycle of existing and new devices, we will be confronted with IoT botnets for years to come.

This presents a critical challenge: how can we remediate the population of vulnerable and compromised IoT devices? Since most compromised devices are consumer products, this implies overcoming several unsolved problems. A recent study into Mirai [1] identified three key challenges:
1. No public information to identify the owner of the device.
2. No established communication channel to reach the owner.
3. Uncertainty about how to provide actionable notifications, as there is often no clear and simple remediation path.

For the first two problems, identifying and contacting owners, we can leverage an existing arrangement: botnet mitigation by ISPs. Many devices are in access networks, so ISPs can identify and contact the customers who own them. For regular PC-based malware, botnet mitigation by ISPs is widely accepted and has met with some success [3]. However, cleaning up infected devices remains an open problem, even for conventional malware. Years of usability research have shown how difficult it is to support end users with little technical expertise in protecting and remediating their personal computers [15].

In the IoT space, this becomes even more challenging. User intuitions (‘folk models’ [34]) about security are less aligned with the IoT environment. The actions users need to take vary across devices, vendors, and local configurations. Unlike conventional malware, there are no automated tools to support users in protecting and remediating infected devices. In short, we do not know whether owners can effectively act on the notifications we can currently provide.

We present the first empirical study of the cleanup of compromised IoT devices in the wild. We collaborated with a mid-sized ISP that notifies Mirai-infected customers via email or by placing their connection in a quarantine network (walled garden). We measured the remediation rate and speed of 220 users in an observational study and a randomized controlled experiment by tracking infections in darknets, honeypots, and abuse reporting data. We combined this with additional scan data to identify the types of affected devices. We also studied the user experience through 76 phone interviews and analyzed the logs of users' communications with the ISP. Finally, we conducted lab tests with real IoT devices to observe the effectiveness of removal actions and measure reinfection speed.

Our contributions include:
- Showing that over 87% of all Mirai-infected IoT devices reside in broadband access networks, highlighting the critical role of ISPs in IoT botnet mitigation.
- Providing the first real-world measurement of remediation rates for Mirai-infected devices, finding that quarantining and notifying affected customers remediates 92% of the infections.
- Finding very high natural remediation rates of 58-74% in the control group and two reference networks where no notifications were sent, likely reflecting the non-persistent nature of the malware.
- Observing a remarkably low reinfection rate, with only 5% of the customers who remediated suffering another infection in the five months after our first study. This highlights the effectiveness of the countermeasures taken by the infected customers but contrasts with our lab tests, which found very fast reinfections of real IoT devices.
- Demonstrating that remediation succeeds even though customer interviews and communications show that many users operate from the wrong mental model, such as running antivirus software on their PC to solve the infection of an IoT device.
- Combining insights on the location of compromised IoT devices, the effectiveness of different treatments, and the experience of real-world users, we contribute scientific evidence for establishing industry best practices around the remediation of compromised IoT.

## II. ISP Botnet Mitigation
Cleaning up infected IoT devices can be seen as the next phase of a long-standing challenge: fighting botnets. Over the past decade, mitigation of PC-based malware has consisted of two complementary approaches: taking down the command-and-control infrastructure and cleaning up the infected hosts. Cleanup is an arduous process that demands efforts from different actors, such as operating system vendors, antivirus vendors, ISPs, and affected end users. As most infected machines reside in consumer broadband networks [3], the role of ISPs has become more salient over time. Best practices and codes of conduct have been published by leading industry associations [21], [23], public-private initiatives [18], [11], and governmental entities [17], [12]. These documents share common recommendations for ISPs around educating customers, detecting infections, notifying customers, and remediating infections.

While existing mitigation practices of ISPs are focused on PC-based malware, they may still provide a good starting point for the remediation of compromised IoT. This assumes that the bulk of the devices reside in the networks of broadband consumer ISPs. To test this assumption, we analyzed the location of compromised devices. Using darknet data, we observed the location of devices infected with a version of Mirai. Darknets, or network telescopes, are routed but unused IP address ranges that passively monitor all arriving traffic. We leveraged observations from a darknet of approximately 300,000 IPv4 addresses, spanning 40 networks in 15 countries. Mirai malware displays worm-like behavior, actively scanning the Internet for spreading itself, so we tracked its presence in the darknet data. We used data collected from January 2016 to April 2018.

We measured per protocol (i.e., per destination port) how many IP addresses were scanning at any point in time. To distinguish Mirai traffic from backscatter traffic and other scanning activity, we uniquely fingerprinted Mirai probes based on an artifact of Mirai’s stateless scanning, where every probe has a TCP sequence number equal to the destination IP address. We observed over 96 million IP addresses. Figure 1 shows the distribution of these IP addresses over six protocols: 23/TCP (Telnet), 2323/TCP (Telnet), 5358/TCP (Telnet), 5555/TCP (TR-069/TR-064), 6789/TCP (Telnet), 7547/TCP (TR-069/TR-064), 23231/TCP (Telnet), 37777/TCP (UPnP), 22/TCP (SSH), 2222/TCP (SSH), 80/TCP (HTTP), 81/TCP (HTTP), 88/TCP (HTTP), 8000/TCP (HTTP), 8080/TCP (HTTP), and 53869/TCP (Realtek SDK Miniigd). Since Mirai’s source code was publicly released, it expanded from targeting telnet to other ports. While port 23 is the second most targeted port, HTTP-related ports have become the main vector, i.e., IoT devices with default credentials for HTTP-related services.

**Figure 1: Percentage of Mirai-infected IP addresses per port**

Next, we mapped these IP addresses to broadband consumer ISPs and other network types using the same approach as a study on ‘regular’ botnet mitigation by broadband ISPs, where a mapping had been developed to identify the Autonomous System Number (ASN) of broadband ISPs in 82 countries [3]. The mapping is organized around ground truth data in the form of a highly accurate commercial database; TeleGeography Globalcomms [29], containing market data on the broadband ISPs in 211 countries. In total, 2,050 ASNs have been labeled manually as belonging to one of the consumer broadband ISPs or to another category: mobile provider, another type of ISP (e.g., business provider), hosting, governmental, educational, and other types of networks. Table I summarizes the percentage of infected IP addresses in each of the network types. The overwhelming majority of these devices (87.61%) are located in ISP broadband networks, while less than 1% reside in other types of networks, including hosting, education, or governmental networks.

| Network Type | #Countries | #ASNs | #IP Addresses |
|--------------|------------|-------|---------------|
| ISP-broadband | 78,885,434 (87.61%) | 232 | 21,196 |
| ISP-mobile | 6,888,640 (7.65%) | 232 | 21,196 |

| Educational | 30,765 (0.03%) | 232 | 21,196 |
| Governmental | 313 (0.01%) | 232 | 21,196 |

| **Total** | **96,041,559 (100%)** | 232 | 21,196 |

## III. Partner ISP Remediation Process
Now that we have established that ISPs are in a crucial position to remediate IoT botnets, even more so than for PC-based botnets, the question becomes: what can they realistically do? To answer this, we collaborated closely with a medium-sized European ISP with several million customers. The ISP decided to include an abuse feed with Mirai-infected hosts, reported by Shadowserver, in their existing botnet notification and remediation process.

At the heart of the ISP’s process is an industry best practice: placing an infected machine into a quarantine network, a so-called walled garden [24]. There are different ways of implementing walled gardens to fight malware infections. RFC6561 [21] describes two types: leaky, which permits access to all Internet resources except those deemed malicious; and strict, which restricts almost all services except those on a whitelist. Our partner ISP has implemented a strict version for its consumer broadband subscribers. The walled garden only allows access to 41 white-listed domains, which provide cleanup tools, antivirus solutions, Microsoft updates, webmail, online banking, and a forum for elderly people.

Besides keeping the infected users safely in quarantine, the walled garden also plays an important role in notifying the user. When the user tries to browse the web, they are redirected to a landing page with a notification about the infection and advice on how to clean it up. The same information is also sent by email to the customers. While emails with the same content can be ignored relatively easily, the walled garden notification cannot.

Next to its own brand, the ISP also provides services to broadband consumers via a subsidiary brand targeting the cheaper end of the market. Customers of the subsidiary brand are not quarantined, and notifications are less common and conducted only via email. The ISP also sells subscriptions in the business and mobile service networks. These customers are never quarantined and do not receive IoT-related security notifications.

The notification and remediation process starts when an infection is reported in one of the trusted abuse feeds that the ISP receives. For IoT malware, the ISP uses the daily Shadowserver Drone feeds [26], which include infections labeled as Mirai. Infected machines are discovered through various methods, including monitoring sinkhole traffic and malicious scans to honeypots. If an IP address in the report belongs to one of its consumer broadband subscribers, the ISP places the connection of that customer in the walled garden and sends an accompanying email with the same information. Occasionally, when the walled garden is full, the ISP sends an email-only notification about the infection.

Once customers are notified via the walled garden, they have three ways of getting out of the quarantine environment:
1. They can release themselves by filling out the form on the landing page and reporting how they have fixed the problem. Submitting the form immediately restores the connection. This option is revoked after two subsequent quarantine events within 30 days to avoid misuse.
2. They can call the ISP's customer support for assistance.
3. The ISP can automatically release the connection if the infection is confirmed to be resolved.

This comprehensive approach ensures that customers are both informed and supported in remediating their infected devices.
