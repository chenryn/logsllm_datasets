**Steps to reproduce and a minimal demo of the problem**
create a new A2RC1 app with angular-cli:
    ng new blah
    cd blah
    npm start
load the page with your dev tools open and observe that it submits over 290
xhr requests at startup. beta-14 (from which we just upgraded) loads about 40.
**Current behavior**
more than 290 requests. (>600 once our 20-30 client-side classes are added)
Many of these requests are duplicated, e.g. exception_handler.js,
base_wrapped_exception.js, and collection.js.
**Expected/desired behavior**
_Far_ fewer requests.
**Other information**
This many requests is going to KILL us at roll-out time.
