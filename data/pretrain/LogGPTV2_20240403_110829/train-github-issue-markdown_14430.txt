### Steps to Reproduce and Minimal Demo of the Problem

1. Create a new A2RC1 application using Angular CLI:
   ```sh
   ng new blah
   cd blah
   npm start
   ```
2. Open the application in your browser with the developer tools enabled.
3. Observe that the application submits over 290 XHR requests at startup. In comparison, version beta-14 (from which we just upgraded) loads approximately 40 requests.

### Current Behavior

- The application makes more than 290 requests at startup.
- When our 20-30 client-side classes are added, the number of requests exceeds 600.
- Many of these requests are duplicated, such as `exception_handler.js`, `base_wrapped_exception.js`, and `collection.js`.

### Expected/Desired Behavior

- The application should make significantly fewer requests at startup.

### Other Information

- This high number of requests will severely impact performance and is a critical issue for our upcoming rollout.
