Hi there,
There is many discusses about babel v6 and customElements v1, see:
  * #4480
  * WICG/webcomponents#423
  * WICG/webcomponents#587
  * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41414034/transpiling-class-based-web-components-with-babel
... and there is some solution out there:
  * https://github.com/WebReflection/classtrophobic
  * https://github.com/github/babel-plugin-transform-custom-element-classes
So, it will be nice when this issue/problem will be resolved with babel v7
