### Title: Siamese Neural Networks for Detecting Brand Impersonation

**Abstract:**

Brand impersonation is a prevalent attack strategy where malicious actors create content that mimics known brands to deceive users into divulging sensitive information, such as account passwords or credit card details. To combat this issue, we developed and trained a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) on a labeled dataset of images to detect brand impersonation. Our dataset comprises over 50,000 screenshots of known malicious login pages, covering more than 1,000 different brand impersonations.

The SNN is designed to learn embeddings that place images of the same brand close together in a low-dimensional space while keeping images of different brands further apart. We then perform nearest-neighbor classification in the embedded space to identify potential impersonations. To evaluate the performance of our SNN, we developed metrics that assess its accuracy on both known and previously unseen brands. Our results show that the SNN outperforms a baseline image hashing algorithm on a held-out test set.

In this paper, we will present the detailed methodology, experimental results, and performance metrics of our SNN. Additionally, we will discuss potential applications and future enhancements to the baseline machine learning model.

**Introduction:**

Brand impersonation is a significant cybersecurity threat, where attackers create fraudulent content that closely resembles legitimate brands to trick users into providing sensitive information. This type of attack can lead to financial loss, identity theft, and other serious consequences. Traditional methods for detecting brand impersonation, such as image hashing, often fall short due to their inability to handle variations in the appearance of the impersonated content.

To address this challenge, we propose a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) approach. SNNs are particularly well-suited for tasks that require comparing pairs of inputs, such as verifying whether two images belong to the same class. In our case, the SNN learns to embed images of the same brand close together in a low-dimensional space, while images of different brands are embedded further apart. This embedding allows us to perform efficient nearest-neighbor classification to detect brand impersonation.

**Dataset:**

Our dataset consists of over 50,000 labeled screenshots of known malicious login pages, encompassing more than 1,000 different brand impersonations. The dataset is carefully curated to include a wide variety of impersonation attempts, ensuring that the SNN is trained on a diverse set of examples.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The images are preprocessed to standardize their size and format.
   - Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the robustness of the model.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - The SNN consists of two identical sub-networks that share the same weights.
   - Each sub-network takes an image as input and outputs a feature vector.
   - The feature vectors from the two sub-networks are compared using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).

3. **Training:**
   - The SNN is trained using a contrastive loss function, which minimizes the distance between feature vectors of the same brand and maximizes the distance between feature vectors of different brands.
   - The training process is performed on a large labeled dataset to ensure that the SNN learns robust and discriminative embeddings.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - We use a held-out test set to evaluate the performance of the SNN.
   - Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) are used to measure the model's performance.
   - We compare the SNN's performance with a baseline image hashing algorithm to demonstrate its superiority.

**Results:**

Our experiments show that the SNN outperforms the baseline image hashing algorithm in terms of all evaluated metrics. The SNN achieves higher precision, recall, and F1-score, and a significantly better AUC-ROC. These results indicate that the SNN is more effective at detecting brand impersonation, even for previously unseen brands.

**Discussion:**

The SNN's ability to learn discriminative embeddings makes it a powerful tool for detecting brand impersonation. However, there are several areas for future work, including:
- **Scalability:** Improving the SNN's efficiency to handle larger datasets and real-time detection.
- **Generalization:** Enhancing the SNN's ability to generalize to new and emerging brands.
- **Robustness:** Increasing the SNN's robustness to adversarial attacks and variations in the appearance of the impersonated content.

**Conclusion:**

In this paper, we presented a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) approach for detecting brand impersonation. Our SNN outperforms a baseline image hashing algorithm on a comprehensive dataset of malicious login pages. The SNN's ability to learn robust and discriminative embeddings makes it a promising solution for combating brand impersonation. Future work will focus on improving the SNN's scalability, generalization, and robustness to further enhance its effectiveness in real-world applications.
