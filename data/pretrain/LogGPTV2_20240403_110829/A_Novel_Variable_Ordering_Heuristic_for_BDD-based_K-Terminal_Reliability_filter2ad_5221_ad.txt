and cardinalities of |Fmax| and maximal BDD-width W in
Table VII. The runtime is listed in seconds. Samples that take
less than one millisecond are annotated with  16 (see Nw.11). To
still obtain some valuable results for very large networks,
bounding [34], [35] or approximation techniques [29] should
be considered. Despite this shortcoming and under
the
condition that |Fmax| is not larger than 16, the new heuristic
allows to compute certain networks which could not be
computed before because of a too large |Fmax| obtained
by the bfs heuristic. Overall,
the application of the new
heuristic for both irregular and regular network structures is
to be favored. In comparison to the KLY, the decomposition
method exhibits a signiﬁcantly better performance over the
wide variety of networks when applied with the new heuristic.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, a novel variable ordering heuristic for relia-
bility graph analysis is derived. This static ordering heuris-
tic runs in O
and ﬁnds for a
wide variety of different network structures an ordering with
