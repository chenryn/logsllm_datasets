User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Password management for kids - what's a good way to start? Consider a young (primary-school age) child who is starting to collect passwords for online services.  How can a parent (or equivalent) help them manage their passwords?

An example to make things clearer: My daughter might want to log on to http://scratch.mit.edu from several locations/devices to show her projects to the family.  She also has a couple of email addresses, one of which she's likely to be using herself soon (under supervision).  While her own device will be logged in, she may need access from others.

So far I take care of it for her: I know her password and (pseudonymous) user ID, and store them in my KeePass.  That's appropriate at this stage, but it's not much help if she needs them without me (short of sending login details in plaintext to her grandparents, for example).  There should also be a solution that doesn't require me to possess these details, from the point of view of sticking to the general rule of keeping your login details secret.  Memorising a really strong master password is probably a bit much to ask, and she's likely to mislay any physical storage.

I like to plan ahead, so moving forwards: What's the best approach to take for a young, fairly bright child, to keep logins safe and train good practice in advance of more important accounts?

Assistant: Maybe the lesson for children should be less about how to use tools to manage a password, and more about understanding why managing passwords is important?

Let them write their passwords in a notebook. Have fun with devising a method for obfuscation in case the notebook is lost. Teach them about backups- keeping a copy someplace safe. In my experience, kids and old people are a lot alike when it comes to password (mis)management

Until they were skilled enough to manage their own password database, I also kept the kids logins in a "family KeePass". This is the same one where the aged family members stuff is- because people die and sometimes you need to recover things for otherwise unable people. The trust/risk calculus is different in a family group than in a work or social circle. There is also a difference between sharing access to a password and sharing a password.  

It is awesome that you are thinking about this early. Good luck!
