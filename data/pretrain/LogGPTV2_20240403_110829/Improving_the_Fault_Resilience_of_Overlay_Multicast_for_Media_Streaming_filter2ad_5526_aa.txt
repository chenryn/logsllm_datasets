**Abstract:**
This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing fault resilience in overlay-based live media streaming from two perspectives: (1) constructing a stable multicast tree that minimizes the impact of frequent member departures on the existing overlay, and (2) efficiently recovering from packet errors caused by end-system or network failures.

The paper makes two key contributions:
1. **Reliability-Oriented Switching Tree (ROST) Algorithm:** A distributed algorithm that minimizes failure correlation among tree nodes by leveraging both bandwidth and time properties. This approach constructs a more reliable multicast tree compared to existing algorithms that solely minimize tree depth, without compromising service delay and with only a small protocol overhead.
2. **Cooperative Error Recovery (CER) Protocol:** A simple yet effective protocol that facilitates efficient recovery from packet errors. Recognizing that a single recovery source often fails to provide timely data delivery, the CER protocol uses residual bandwidths from multiple sources, identified through a minimum-loss-correlation algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed schemes.

## 1. Introduction

Overlay multicast [4] has emerged as an effective technique for large-scale data dissemination over networks. While shifting multicast functionality from routers to end hosts enhances flexibility, the transient nature of end hosts introduces reliability issues. In an overlay multicast tree, the unannounced departure of a member can cause data outages for all downstream members. This paper focuses on live media streaming, where data is streamed from a single source to numerous clients over a data delivery tree. This application has several characteristics that differentiate it from other applications (e.g., file transfers), necessitating special considerations in system design:
1. **Bandwidth-Intensive with Limited Resources:** Each member has an out-degree constraint, and there may be many free-riders (zero-out-degree members) in the network [10, 13, 15].
2. **Heterogeneous Bandwidths:** Multicast members exhibit significant heterogeneity in bandwidths [11, 13], leading to a wide range of out-degrees and varied tree shapes under different overlay construction methods.
3. **Best-Effort Reliability:** Multimedia streaming does not require perfect reliability, and packet error recovery can be performed in a best-effort manner.

Based on these observations, this paper proposes two techniques to enhance the fault resilience of live media streaming:
- **Reliability-Oriented Switching Tree (ROST) Algorithm:** A proactive component that adjusts the tree structure to minimize failure correlation among nodes. The ROST algorithm combines members' bandwidth and time properties to construct a more reliable tree.
- **Cooperative Error Recovery (CER) Protocol:** A reactive mechanism that recovers from streaming disruptions caused by upstream node failures. The CER protocol uses multiple recovery nodes, identified via a minimum-loss-correlation algorithm, to recover from data outages.

Simulations under realistic settings show that ROST reduces the average number of streaming disruptions per member by 36-57% compared to a centralized depth-optimal approach, achieves the smallest end-to-end service delay among three representative distributed algorithms, and incurs only a small increase in service delay (10-15%) compared to the centralized approach. Additionally, it introduces very low protocol overhead.

### 2.1 Construction of Overlay Multicast Trees

Early work on overlay construction for large-scale single-source multicast includes NICE [1] and ZIGZAG [14]. However, these methods do not consider out-degree limits and are not suitable for high-bandwidth media streaming.

For media data multicast, most algorithms aim to build a fault-resilient overlay. A common approach is to construct a short tree, which reduces the number of descendant nodes affected by a failed node and generally leads to a small average service delay. Examples include the minimum depth algorithm [5, 9, 12] and its variants [8].

Birrer et al. propose building a "fat tree" [3] with similar characteristics to a short and wide tree. The high-bandwidth-first algorithm [5] places nodes in a non-increasing order of bandwidths, achieving global optimization but with high protocol overhead.

In contrast, Sripanidkulchai et al. [12] leverage the long-tailed lifetime distribution of members, proposing the longest-first algorithm, which selects the longest-lived member with spare bandwidth as the parent. However, this approach results in a tall tree, leading to poor performance.

### 2.2 Packet Error Recovery for Overlay Multicast

Several protocols have been proposed for packet error recovery in overlay multicast:
- **STORM [17]:** A resilient multicast protocol for continuous-media applications, using multiple recovery parents. The selection and recovery procedures differ from our CER protocol.
- **Lateral Error Recovery (LER) [16]:** Organizes subtrees under the root node to ensure fast and reliable error recovery. This method may result in large network stretch under out-degree constraints.
- **Probabilistic Resilient Multicast (PRM) [2]:** Uses randomized forwarding to add cross-tree edges for proactive packet loss repair. PRM handles node failures by increasing the forwarding probability of recovery nodes.
- **Cooperative Patching [6]:** Uses a list of recovery nodes for each receiver to handle data outages, but imposes high overheads on multicast nodes.

## 3. Reliability-Oriented Switching Tree (ROST) Algorithm

The ROST algorithm is designed to minimize failure correlation among tree nodes by combining members' bandwidth and time properties. It defines a metric called Bandwidth-Time Product (BTP) as the product of a member's outbound bandwidth and its age. Nodes with high BTP values are gradually moved up the tree in a distributed manner. This approach ensures a more reliable tree structure while maintaining a small end-to-end service delay and minimal protocol overhead.

## 4. Cooperative Error Recovery (CER) Protocol

The CER protocol is a reactive mechanism that recovers from streaming disruptions caused by upstream node failures. When a non-leaf node fails, affected nodes need to rejoin the tree, involving failure detection and parent re-finding. During this period, affected nodes retrieve lost data from other normal nodes before their receiving buffer is exhausted. The CER protocol identifies multiple recovery nodes using a minimum-loss-correlation algorithm, ensuring efficient and timely data recovery.

## 5. Simulation Methodology

The simulation methodology involves setting up realistic experimental conditions to evaluate the performance of the ROST algorithm and the CER protocol. Key metrics include the number of streaming disruptions, end-to-end service delay, and protocol overhead.

## 6. Simulation Results

Simulation results demonstrate that the ROST algorithm significantly reduces the average number of streaming disruptions per member, achieves the smallest end-to-end service delay among three representative distributed algorithms, and introduces minimal protocol overhead. The CER protocol also shows substantial improvements in recovering from node failures.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper presents two techniques, the ROST algorithm and the CER protocol, to enhance the fault resilience of overlay-based live media streaming. The ROST algorithm constructs a more reliable multicast tree by minimizing failure correlation, while the CER protocol efficiently recovers from packet errors using multiple recovery nodes. Simulations validate the effectiveness of these approaches, making them valuable contributions to the field of overlay multicast for media streaming.
