Halp ticket:
  * support/6c407d52c9f711e38a0cc47a4027f259
> Git support does not handle files with accented characters correctly,
> declaring them as new. See e.g spec/fixtures/subdir/áccéntéd.svg in
> atom/markdown-preview or lloeki/svg-preview plugins.
Steps to reproduce:
    $ git clone  https://github.com/lloeki/svg-preview
    $ cd svg-preview
    $ atom .
Notice that there's a file marked as new in the tree view --
`spec/fixtures/subdir/áccéntéd.svg`.

However, I can't reproduce this issue with the markdown-preview repository
which has a file with the same name.
