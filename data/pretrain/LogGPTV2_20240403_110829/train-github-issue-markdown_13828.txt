### Support Ticket: Handling of Files with Accented Characters

**Ticket ID:** support/6c407d52c9f711e38a0cc47a4027f259

**Issue Description:**
Git support does not handle files with accented characters correctly, marking them as new. This issue can be observed, for example, with the file `spec/fixtures/subdir/áccéntéd.svg` in the `atom/markdown-preview` or `lloeki/svg-preview` plugins.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/lloeki/svg-preview
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   $ cd svg-preview
   ```

3. Open the project in Atom:
   ```bash
   $ atom .
   ```

4. Observe that the file `spec/fixtures/subdir/áccéntéd.svg` is marked as new in the tree view.

**Additional Information:**
I was unable to reproduce this issue with the `markdown-preview` repository, which also contains a file with the same name (`spec/fixtures/subdir/áccéntéd.svg`).
