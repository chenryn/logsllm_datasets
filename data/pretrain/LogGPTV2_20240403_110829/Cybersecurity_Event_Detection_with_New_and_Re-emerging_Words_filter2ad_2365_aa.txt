### Abstract
Open data sources contain a wealth of threat-related information. Early identification of emerging security threats from these sources is crucial for the protection of deployed software and systems. While several cybersecurity event detection methods have been proposed to extract security events from unstructured text, most existing methods focus on detecting events with a high volume of mentions. However, to outpace attackers, security analysts and IT operators need to be aware of critical security events as early as possible, regardless of the number of mentions. In this paper, we introduce a novel event detection system that can quickly identify critical security events, such as new threats and the resurgence of attacks or related events, from Twitter, irrespective of their mention volume. Unlike traditional methods, our approach triggers events by monitoring new and re-emerging words, allowing us to narrow down candidate events among hundreds. It then forms events by clustering tweets associated with these trigger words. This method enables the early detection of new and resurgent threats. We empirically demonstrate that our system performs effectively across a wide range of threat types.

## 1. Introduction
The rapid adoption of new technologies like cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G has expanded the attack surface, leading to a significant increase in cyber threats. According to Symantec’s Internet Security Threat Report [5], not only has the volume of cyber threats grown, but the threat landscape has also become more diverse, with threats originating from new and unexpected sources.

To mitigate the risks posed by these increasing cyber threats, it is essential for organizations to detect and analyze ongoing cybersecurity events as early as possible. A vast amount of information related to security threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks is published daily on various informal sources such as social media platforms, blogs, and developer forums. This makes it nearly impossible for human analysts to manually review and evaluate all the relevant information. Consequently, there is a growing interest in technologies for automatic event detection and alert generation from open data sources.

Social media, particularly Twitter, is a valuable source for gathering threat-related information due to its high volume and diversity. Various security stakeholders, including individual experts, mainstream news outlets, and security firms, use Twitter to share and disseminate information. Tweets posted by these accounts range from announcements of security contests and product promotions to the latest cybersecurity events, such as ransomware attacks, DDoS attacks, and data breaches. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Twitter as an early sensor for cybersecurity events [41, 49].

In many application areas, events mentioned by multiple users on Twitter are considered important, such as natural disasters or breaking news. Therefore, many event detection algorithms are designed to detect events with a high volume of mentions. However, in the security domain, the number of mentions may not be proportional to the importance of an event, especially in its early stages. Many cybersecurity events start with only a few mentions and remain unknown until their impact is analyzed. For example, the Magellan vulnerability was mentioned only twice on its first day and less than five times within the next three days. On the fourth day, the number of mentions exceeded 70. Similarly, the new Android malware Mysterybot was first tweeted on June 7th, 2018, but did not gain attention until six days later when its analysis report was published. These events cannot be detected early by algorithms that require a large volume of mentions. Thus, we aim to detect such security events regardless of their mention volume.

Given the number of daily security events and the high rate of false positives, it is not practical to detect all security events. From a security perspective, early identification of new cyber threats or events with a sudden increase in mentions is crucial for preventing cyber attacks. Therefore, this paper focuses on detecting new and resurgent threats among a large number of daily security events.

Several cybersecurity event detection methods have been proposed to extract events from Twitter [27, 29, 34, 40, 44]. However, these methods have limitations, such as focusing on high-volume events, generating many false positives, or suffering from false negatives. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel event detection system (W2E: Words to Events) that detects new and resurgent cyber threats in their early stages with a low false positive rate and high event detection coverage. W2E achieves this by adopting a word-level event monitoring approach, identifying new and re-emerging words to discover new and resurgent threats. We define new words as those that have not appeared before the time of event detection, and re-emerging words as those that have appeared previously but show a significant increase in frequency at the time of detection. After identifying these words, W2E uses a clustering algorithm to form events. To reduce false positives, W2E employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Additionally, W2E restricts data collection to selected Twitter users to further reduce false positives.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
- We examine the coverage and latency of 105 cybersecurity events in 2018 across several open data sources and demonstrate that Twitter is often the first and sometimes the only source to discuss security events.
- We develop a simple yet effective word-based event detection algorithm that can quickly identify critical security events, such as new cyber threats and the resurgence of attacks, regardless of their mention volume.
- We develop a cybersecurity event detection system (W2E) that achieves high performance. Our evaluation results with real Twitter data show that W2E can achieve high recall (89%), high precision (80%), and low detection latency (45 out of 82 security events were detected with zero latency) over malware, exploit, vulnerability, DDoS attack, and data breach events.

## 2. Related Work
Event detection has been a long-standing research topic in various application areas. Several works have been proposed to detect special events from Twitter, such as earthquakes, infectious disease outbreaks, and terrorist attacks [22, 42, 43, 45]. Many existing event detection methods cluster tweets based on their semantic distances. Other approaches, such as word-based event detection, have also been explored. Kleinberg [28] introduced the concept of bursty activity, where the appearance of an event in a data stream is signaled by a sharp rise in the frequency of certain features. This opened the door to word monitoring for event detection. Several methods have been developed to detect bursty events by analyzing word-specific signals in the time or frequency domain [24–26, 32, 47]. Fung et al. [25] proposed a probabilistic approach to detect bursty keywords, while Mathioudakis and Koudas [32] introduced an event detection system by identifying bursty keywords and grouping them with their co-occurrences. Weng and Lee [47] used wavelet transformation to filter out trivial words and then clustered the remaining words to discover events.

While general-purpose event detection methods can be applied to the cybersecurity domain, they are not directly suitable for detecting critical security events like new and resurgent threats. The challenge lies in extracting monitoring words that reflect the attributes of cybersecurity events. Existing word-based methods often fail to handle new words or detect threats with a small volume of mentions. For example, when a new Mirai variant, called Wicked, appeared on May 17th, 2018, bursty event detection methods failed to detect it with the word "mirai" because its expected occurrence was higher than its observed occurrence (8 tweets).

Several methods for detecting cybersecurity events from Twitter have been proposed. Le Sceller et al. [29] used local sensitive hashing (LSH) to cluster tweets and detect the first stories of streaming tweets. Khadpur et al. [27] proposed a method that clusters tweets within a certain time window to build events. However, these methods still focus on high-volume events and may miss new and resurgent threats.
