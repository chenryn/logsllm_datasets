ABSTRACT
There is plenty of threat-related information in open data sources.
Early identification of emerging security threats from such infor-
mation is an important part of security for deployed software and
systems. While several cybersecurity event detection methods have
been proposed to extract security events from unstructured text in
open data sources, most of the existing methods focus on detecting
events that have a large volume of mentions. On the contrary, to
respond faster than attackers, security analysts and IT operators
need to be aware of critical security events as early as possible, no
matter how many mentions about an event are made. In this paper,
we propose a novel event detection system that can quickly identify
critical security events, such as new threats and resurgence of an
attack or related event, from Twitter regardless of their volume
of mentions. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed method
triggers events by monitoring new words and re-emerging words,
making it possible to narrow down candidate events among several
hundreds of events. It then forms events by clustering tweets linked
with the trigger words. This approach enables us to detect new and
resurgent threats as early as possible. We empirically demonstrate
that our system works promisingly over a wide range of threat
types.

1 INTRODUCTION
As new technologies like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G are competitively adopted in the
digital market, attack surfaces have been continuously widened.
This leads to a significant growth of cyber threats and results in
exposing individuals as well as organizations to higher security
risk. According to Symantec’s Internet Security Threat Report [5],
not only has the sheer volume of cyber threats increased every year,
but the threat landscape has become more diverse, so more and
more threats come from new and unexpected sources.
To mitigate the risk from increasing cyber threats, it is important
for organizations to sense the ongoing cybersecurity events as early
as possible and analyze a potential impact of the detected events on
their products, services, and infrastructures. A lot of information
related to security threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks is published
on various informal sources like social media platforms, blogs, and
developer forums on a daily basis, making it almost impossible for
a human analyst to manually review and evaluate its relevance to
his/her organization. For this reason, technologies for automatic
event detection and alert generation from open data sources have
attracted great attention in research communities and industries.
Social media is an efficient way to be continuously informed
on emerging cybersecurity threats. Among others, Twitter is the
most fruitful source to gather threat-related information in terms
of volume and diversity. Diverse groups of security stakeholders,
ranging from individual security experts, mainstream news to se-
curity firms, run Twitter accounts and use Twitter as the source
of information diffusion. Tweets posted by these accounts vary
from security contest announcement, product promotion, new vul-
nerability findings to sharing the latest cybersecurity events like
ransomware attacks, DDoS attacks, and data breaches. Many recent
studies have also demonstrated the possibilities of Twitter as an
early sensor for cybersecurity events [41, 49].
In many application areas, the events mentioned on Twitter by
several users are important, for example, natural disasters detection
or breaking news detection. So, many event detection algorithms
have been designed to detect events that are mentioned by a lot of
people. However, in security domain, the number of mentions may
not be proportional to the importance of an event at the beginning
of the event, as we show later in Section 3. A lot of cybersecurity
events start to be discussed by only few users in their early stages

Such events take a few days to make a number of mentions. For
example, the Magellan vulnerability, a SQLite remote code execu-
tion vulnerability, was mentioned only twice by @tencent_blade
and @NickyWu_ on its first day (December 11th, 2018) and less
than 5 times by December 14th 2018. On December 15th 2018, the
number of mentions exceeded 70. Also, new Android malware Mys-
terybot was first tweeted on June 7th 2018 by @ThreatFabric, but
did not gain attention for 6 days until its analysis report was pub-
lished. One day after the analysis report, more than 100 tweets
were posted. These kinds of events cannot be detected in their early
stages by event detection algorithms requiring a large volume of
mentions. Thus, we aim to detect such security events regardless of
their volume of mentions. Nonetheless, considering the number of
daily security events and a large number of false positives, it is not
desirable to detect all the security events from small to large. It is
very challenging to decide which events should be perceived. From
security perspectives, early identification of new cyber threats or
events whose mentions are suddenly increased plays an important
role in preventing cyber attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we focus
on detection of new and resurgent threats among a large number
of daily security events.
Several cybersecurity event detection methods have been pro-
posed to extract events from Twitter [27, 29, 34, 40, 44]. However,
as we discuss later in Section 2, they cannot be applicable to achieve
the goal above due to at least one of the following limitations: (i)
it focuses on detecting events of large volume, which means that
there is a high likelihood of failing to detect an event in its early
stage [27, 29], (ii) it incurs many false positives to capture events of
small volume [27, 29], and (iii) it suffers from many false negatives
although it has a capability of early event detection [34, 40, 44].
Motivated by the limitations of the existing methods, we propose
a novel event detection system (W2E: Words to Events) that per-
ceives new and resurgent cyber threats in their early stages with low
false positive rate and high event detection coverage. W2E achieves
this goal by adopting a word-level event monitoring rather than
semantic clustering approaches. Among various types of words,
W2E identifies new words and re-emerging words to discover new
and resurgent cyber threats. We define new words as the words
that have not been seen before the time of event detection. They are
likely to be linked with new security events like new malware and
new vulnerabilities. Re-emerging words are defined as the words
that have appeared at least once before the time of event detec-
tion, but show a significant rise in their frequencies at the time of
detection. They are likely to represent security events associated
with the former victims or the former threats like the well-known
malware and vulnerabilities. Re-emerging words include company
names like “google”, product names like “android” or “iphone”, mal-
ware names like “mirai”, vulnerability names like “heartbleed”, and
technologies like “wpa2”. With re-emerging words, we can detect
security events that have occurred earlier, but suddenly become an
issue again. We can also detect new security events that have no new
terms. After identifying new and re-emerging words, W2E merges
or splits tweets grouped by the detected words with a clustering
algorithm to form events. W2E is a word-level event monitoring,
so it may have a performance issue without proper text handling.
For example, monitoring words regardless of their parts of speech
(noun, verb, adjective, etc.) or inflections results in too many false
positives. W2E adopts many natural language processing (NLP)
techniques such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, lemmatization,
and named entity recognition (NER) to reduce false positives as
much as possible. In addition, W2E greatly reduces false positives
by restricting data collection with the selected Twitter users.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• Despite popularity of Twitter as a data source for event de-
tection, there is no evaluation on whether Twitter is really
the right source for early cyber threat detection. We examine
coverage and latency of 105 cybersecurity events in 2018
across several open data sources and demonstrate that Twit-
ter is largely the first source, and sometimes the only source,
to discuss security events. (Section 3)
• We develop a simple yet effective algorithm for a word-based
event detection. The proposed approach enables to quickly
identify critical security events, such as new cyber threats
and resurgence of an attack or related event, regardless of
their volume of mentions. (Section 4)
• We develop a cybersecurity event detection system that
achieves high performance. Our evaluation results with real
Twitter data show that W2E can achieve high recall (89%),
high precision (80%), and low detection latency (45 out of 82
security events were detected with zero latency) over mal-
ware, exploit, vulnerability, DDoS attack, and data breach
events. (Section 5)
2 RELATED WORK
Event detection has long been a research topic in various appli-
cation areas. Several works have been proposed to detect special
events from Twitter, such as earthquakes, infectious disease out-
break, and terrorist attacks [22, 42, 43, 45],. Many of the existing
event detection methods detect events by clustering tweets based
on their semantic distances. Other than semantic clustering ap-
proaches, there are word-based event detection methods. Unlike
many event detection algorithms that are interested in events of
large scale [38, 42, 43, 45, 48], Kleinberg [28] assumes that the
appearance of an event in data stream is signaled by a burst of
activity with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the
event emerges. This opens door to the possibility of word moni-
toring for event detection. There are several methods that analyze
word-specific signals in time or frequency domain to detect bursty
events [24–26, 32, 47]. Fung et al. [25] proposed a probabilistic
approach to detect a set of bursty keywords for a bursty event.
Mathioudakis and Koudas [32] introduced an event detection sys-
tem by identifying bursty keywords and then grouping them with
their co-occurrences. Weng and Lee [47] proposed a method by
applying wavelet transformation on word-specific signals, such as
df-idf scores of words in time domain, to filter out trivial words and
then clustering the remaining words to discover events. In a simi-
lar manner to Fung et al. [25] and Mathioudakis and Koudas [32],
Fedoryszak et al. [24] proposed a real-time event detection system
that discovers events whose occurrences are different from normal
levels of conversations.
It is natural to consider applying general-purpose event detection
methods in the literature to cybersecurity domain. In particular, one

to cybersecurity event detection since they can detect events ear-
lier than semantic clustering approaches. However, they are not
directly applicable to cybersecurity event detection. In order to
avoid a high number of false positives, the way of extracting the
monitoring words needs to be redesigned to reflect attributes of cy-
bersecurity events, which is quite challenging. Also, they have their
own limitations in detection of critical security events like new and
resurgent threats. In cybersecurity domain, new malware appears
everyday and is often named with new words. At the beginning of
new malware appearance, there are usually few mentions about it.
However, they neither provide how to handle new words [25] nor
detect cyber threats whose volume is small [24, 32, 47]. In addition,
the existing methods [24, 25, 32] sometimes fail to detect resurgent
threats like malware variants in their early stages. Since they identi-
fied bursty words for event detection by measuring the deviance of
the observed occurrences from the expected occurrences computed
based on their historical appearance proportions in Twitter stream,
they fail to detect events that had been mentioned in large scale ear-
lier, but emerge again with small volume. For example, when a new
Mirai variant, called Wicked, appeared on May 17th 2018, the bursty
event detection methods [24, 25, 32] fail to detect it with the word
“mirai”. This is because “mirai” had appeared over months with
moderate to large number of mentions due to its several variants,
so its expected occurrence was higher than its observed occurrence
(8 tweets) at the time of emergence of the Wicked botnet.
Several methods for detecting cybersecurity events from Twitter
have been proposed so far. Le Sceller et al. [29] proposed a cyber-
security event detector that identifies events by clustering tweets
based on local sensitive hashing (LSH). They clustered tweets within
a certain time window to build events and then detected the first
stories of streaming tweets by checking whether new tweets form
new clusters, as in Petrović et al. [38]. Khadpur et al. [27] proposed
