require  a  change 
in 
routing  protocols  and 
Many  secure  routing  works  have  been  designed  to  protect  the 
integrity  of  routing  messages.  However,  they  are  designed  for 
specific 
the 
specification  of  the  protocols.  As  a  result,  they  usually  become 
new  routing  protocols.  In  addition,  they  adopt  public  key  based 
digital signature, which requires high computation overhead and 
may not be affordable for nodes in MANET. 
Our goal aims at providing a protection, which does not modify 
the  protocols  and  requires  low  computation  and  low  message 
overhead,  to  prevent  forwarded  routing  messages  from  being 
forged.    We  propose  Distributed  Routing  Message  Tracing  and 
Authentication intrusion detection model (DRETA).  DRETA has 
a  distributed  architecture  and  an  independent  security  layer, 
separated from the network layer, such that it does not require the 
modification of the routing protocol.  Furthermore, DRETA uses 
symmetric keys to provide authentication services for all routing 
messages with lower computation overhead than public keys.  In 
order to allow symmetric keys to be distributed in public channels 
like  Public  Key  Infrastructure  (PKI)  does,  DRETA  adopts  one-
way key chain[2] and delay key disclosure[1] techniques. Besides, 
DRETA  proposes  the  use  of  Validation  Message  (VM),  which 
carries HMAC[3] to protect the integrity of forwarded messages;  
and it uses the Previous Forwarder (PF) to propagate the keys and 
VMs  such  that  message  overhead  is  reduced.  We  implement 
DRETA  on  two  representatives,  AODV[4]  and  OLSR[5],  of 
reactive and proactive routing protocols  of MANET respectively. 
The results show that DRETA is a scalable, efficient, and generic 
solution  which  costs  low  overhead  to  protect  the  integrity  and 
authenticity of forwarded routing messages in MANET. 
2.  PROBEMS AND DESIGN CHALLENGES 
MANET  relies  deeply  on  the  distributed  routing  service,  which 
assumes  that  nodes  are  cooperative  and  honest.  An  attacker  can 
easily disrupt the routing service in MANET in two ways:  
(1) Drop forwarded packets, or  
(2) Send routing messages containing forged content.   
In  the  first  category,  a  selfish  node  can  intentionally  drop  all 
forwarded packets going through it (Black Hole).  Alternatively, it 
can selectively drop those packets from or toward certain nodes it 
dislikes. The second category of attacks involves impersonation, 
which is the essential requirement for secure routing mechanisms.  
An  attacker  can  forge  message  contents  by  the  following  attack 
methods: (A) Modify a packet forwarded from the originator, (B) 
Create a forged message and pretend that it is forwarded from the 
originator. 
Tracing  the content  of  forwarded messages  is  a challenging and 
costly  task  might  result  in  high  computation  and  message 
overhead, and this would not be affordable for MANET due to the 
ABSTRACT 
A  Mobile  Ad  Hoc  Network  (MANET)  is  a  group  of  mobile 
wireless nodes that can communicate with each other without pre-
established  base  stations.  Their  communication 
relies  on 
cooperative forwarding behavior, and therefore, routing service is 
critical for MANET. Most routing protocols depend on forwarded 
routing messages. If a malicious node propagates forged routing 
information through forwarded routing messages, all other nodes’ 
routing  tables  will  be  damaged.  We  first  propose  Distributed 
Routing  Evidence  Tracing  and  Authentication 
intrusion 
prevention  model  (DRETA)  for  MANET  routing  protocols. 
DRETA  provides  low  computation  authentication  service  by 
adopting one-way key chain with delayed key disclosure. DRETA 
proposes Previous Forwarder (PF), which is a scalable technique 
for  tracing  and  protecting  the  routing  evidence  of  forwarded 
routing  messages.  Second,  we  implement  DRETA  in  two 
representative routing protocols in MANET, Ad-hoc On-demand 
Distance  Vector  routing  protocol  (AODV)  and  Optimized  Link 
State  Routing  protocol  (OLSR).  Experimental  results  show  that 
DRETA is accurate, scalable, and requires low message overhead, 
and offers small delays under high mobility conditions.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
In  many  routing  protocols  of  MANET,  the  routing  building 
process  relies  deeply  on  forwarded  messages,  which  are  routing 
messages  forwarded  by  intermediate  nodes.  If  a  malicious 
intermediate node forges the content of a forwarded message and 
broadcasts it, the forged content will be propagated to the entire 
network and cause widespread damages to the routing topology.

loss.  Furthermore,  DRETA  has  an 
limited computation  and  bandwidth  resources.  In  addition,  since 
MANET  is  a  fully  distributed  environment,  tracing  flooding 
messages may also cause scalability problems. Therefore, the new 
approach must be scalable, efficient, and have low message and 
computational overhead.  
3.  DRETA 
3.1  Detection Architecture 
DRETA proposes a fully distributed detection architecture, in 
which, each node has a detector to validate routing messages sent 
from its neighbors. Since neighboring nodes in DRETA validate 
received  routing  message  from  each  other,  DRETA  is  scalable 
because of relying neither on costly promiscuous monitoring nor 
complicated  hierarchy  management.  This  distributed  monitoring 
not  only  adapts  to  the  distributed  environment  of  MANET  but 
also  resolves  critical  issues  of  MANET,  such  as  mobility  and 
independent 
message 
detection  layer  and  does  not  modify  the  protected  routing 
protocols,  but  instead  piggybacks  Validation  Messages  (VMs) 
with routing messages for message validation. 
3.2  Distributed Message Validation 
DRETA  adopts  one-way  key  chain[2]  with  delay  key 
disclosure[1]  to  perform  public  key  style  key  management.  By 
using  a  Sending  Buffer  and  Validation  Messages(VMs), 
DRETA  performs  instant  message  validation  with  one-way  key 
chain and has low computation overhead and message delay. 
A node N first generates a series of key chains [K1,K2,...,Kn] at 
time  [T1,T2,...,Tn],  in  which  Ki  can  produce  Ki-1  but  cannot 
produce Ki+1. So, in a time frame Ti, node N can use Ki as the 
private key and Ki-1 as the public key. Thus, DRETA has public 
key property only with symmetric key computation overhead. 
DRETA  develops  a  Validation  Message(VM)  to  protect  the 
integrity of forwarded messages. In Fig. 1, when a node N has a 
new forwarded message M to be sent, N buffers the message M 
and generates a VM for M with a unique Ki, which is the current 
N's private key and is used for M only. N first sends M's VM to 
those  prospective  receivers  and  then  sends  message  M  with  Ki 
after Ki expires. When the receivers receive M and Ki, they can 
use M's VM to validate M instantly.
