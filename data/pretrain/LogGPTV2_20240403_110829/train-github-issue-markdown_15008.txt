Actually, EhCacheFactoryBean doesn't allow instanciate EhCache caches with
CacheEventListeners. This forbids for instance to instanciate caches that
supports distribution over a cluster, because the way ehcache runs needs the
cache to be fully setup before adding it to the CacheManager (see
net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListener.notifyCacheAdded(String)).
I wrote an extended version of EhCacheFactoryBean so that I can provide
cacheEventListeners to the factory in order to have distribution works.  
Now I think you can backport my class to spring-core so that evereybody can
use it. As I can't find the url of spring scm, I can't provide patch, although
I wish I could.
Here is what you have to setup in your bean definition :  
false  
itemsReferenceData  
true  
10000  
true
