### 4.3 Effect on Satisfaction

We analyzed participants' satisfaction with browsing experience, product choices, prices, and perceived quality. All measures, except for satisfaction with browsing experience, were assessed twice: immediately after the experiment (ex-ante) and after the physical delivery of the purchased product (ex-post).

#### 4.3.1 Product Search Time

Participants who found the study difficult spent more time searching for products. On average, participants spent more time searching for durable and hedonic products or when they were more involved in the purchase decision. The frequency of product purchasing and self-reported absence of exposure to brand ads in the 30 days prior to the experiment were not significantly associated with the product search time.

| Type of Link | NoBlock | Block |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Organic links | 4.36    | 4.27  |
| Sponsored Google Shopping listings | 2.69*** | -     |
| Overall sponsored links (top) | 4.72 | 6.1   |
| Overall sponsored links (bottom) | 4.12 | 4.27  |

#### 4.3.2 Satisfaction with Product Prices

**Ex-ante (immediately after the experiment):**
- 66% of participants were satisfied with the prices of the chosen products.
- There was no significant difference in ex-ante price satisfaction between experimental conditions (t(1665) = −1.49; p = 0.14) and between home computer users and non-users of ad-blockers (t(1665) = 0.67; p = 0.5).
- Participants using specific search queries had lower ex-ante price satisfaction (t(1665) = 9.4; p = 0.00).
- Higher prices and longer search times negatively affected ex-ante satisfaction with prices.
- Ex-ante satisfaction with expected quality, product durability, and purchase-decision involvement were positively associated with ex-ante satisfaction with prices.
- Ex-ante satisfaction with the prices of products chosen from sponsored Google Shopping listings in the NoBlock condition was lower than for products from organic links (ANOVA: beta = −0.33, p = 0.04).

**Ex-post (after product delivery):**
- 55% of participants in the NoBlock condition and 69% of participants in the Block condition were satisfied with the prices of the received products.
- The difference in Likert scale responses was not significant (t(154) = −1.82, p = 0.07) and did not hold up when including the full set of controls (Table 8, model 4, in S6.3).
- There was no significant difference in ex-post price satisfaction between home computer users and non-users of ad-blockers (t(154) = 0.37, p = 0.71).
- Specific search queries were associated with lower ex-post price satisfaction (t(154) = 4.7, p = 0.00).
- Prices, search time, purchase-decision involvement, frequency of product purchasing, durability, and hedonic nature of the product had no significant association (p > 0.05).
- Ex-post satisfaction with the product quality and absence of prior exposure to brand ads were associated with higher ex-post price satisfaction.
- Ex-post price satisfaction was lower, but not significantly so, for products purchased from sponsored Google Shopping listings (ANOVA: beta = −1.23, p = 0.08) compared to organic links in the NoBlock condition.

#### 4.3.3 Satisfaction with Perceived Product Quality

**Ex-ante (immediately after the experiment):**
- 72% of the time in the NoBlock condition and 69% of the time in the Block condition, participants were satisfied with the expected quality of the chosen products.
- There was no statistically significant difference between conditions (t(1665) = −0.21, p = 0.84) and between home computer users and non-users of ad-blockers (t(1665) = 0.96, p = 0.34).
- According to a bivariate statistical test, ex-ante satisfaction with the expected quality of products chosen using specific branded search queries was lower (t(1665) = 7.29, p = 0.00) than for generic searches; however, this association was not statistically significant in the multivariate regression (Table 9 in S6.4).
- Price, satisfaction with price, product durability, frequent product purchasing, high purchase-decision involvement, hedonic nature of the product, search time, and prior exposure to brand ads had no significant association with ex-ante quality satisfaction (p > 0.05).
- ANOVA demonstrated lower ex-ante satisfaction with the quality of products chosen from sponsored bottom (but not top) links (beta = −1.01, p = 0.03) and Google Shopping listings (beta = −0.68, p = 0.00) relative to organic links in the NoBlock condition.

**Ex-post (after product delivery):**
- 68% and 71% of participants were satisfied with the quality of purchased products in the NoBlock and Block conditions, respectively.
- This degree of satisfaction did not differ between conditions (t(154) = −0.25, p = 0.80), or between users and non-users of ad-blockers on home computers (t(154) = 0.24, p = 0.81).
- A negative association between specific branded search queries and satisfaction with the quality of purchased products was found in the bivariate statistical test (t(154) = 2.81, p = 0.01), but not in the multivariate regression model (Table 10 in S6.4).
- The only statistically significant positive predictors of ex-post satisfaction with the quality in the regression (Table 10 in S6.4) were product durability, frequent product purchasing, high purchase-decision involvement, and ex-post satisfaction with the product price.
- The types of search results (sponsored or organic) showed no effect.

### 5 Limitations and Future Work

Before discussing the findings and their implications, we highlight the current limitations in the analysis and ongoing work aimed at addressing these issues.

1. **Internal Validity:**
   - To preserve internal validity, participants were asked to search for specific product types without modifying the search queries. However, they were free to explore websites to choose the product, vendor, and price they liked the most.
   - We measured and controlled for their purchase-decision involvement with each product category. Based on the Mittal scale, 89% of participants "cared which one [they] bought," 87% felt it "was important to make the right choice of the product," and 87% were "concerned about the outcome of [their] choice."
   - Behavioral lab research successfully uses seemingly low-involvement goods (e.g., mugs). The study was incentive-compatible, and participants had to buy the products using their own credit card and personal details. As the incentives offered in the experiment are analogous to real-world consumer economic behaviors, the experimental results are expected to generalize to real-world effects to a justified extent.

2. **Order Effect:**
   - A significant order effect suggests that participants spent less time on the search closer to the end of the experiment, but this did not significantly affect the prices of the chosen products.
   - We tried to mitigate time pressure by informing participants that the number of products they searched for would not affect payment and by showing elapsed time rather than a countdown timer.
   - Future field experiments will be conducted without imposing any time pressure, and participants' purchase decisions will not be restricted by the experimenter.

3. **Product Quality Differences:**
   - In this study, we did not consider differences in product quality across conditions and categories, which is part of our ongoing research efforts.

4. **Sample Size and Experimental Period:**
   - Null treatment effects may be due to limited sample size or a short experimental period. However, we were able to rule out large effects, and standard errors on treatment coefficients allowed us to assess statistical power.
   - Due to randomization, the treatment variable is uncorrelated with model covariates, reducing the variance. Including covariates reduces the model residual and hence the standard error of the treatment variable coefficient. Thus, our statistical analysis is rigorous, and results are robust and internally valid.
   - In future work, we plan to expand both the sample size and the experimental period.

5. **Focus on Contextual Ads:**
   - We focused on contextual ads rather than behaviorally targeted ads. Running a tightly controlled lab experiment allowed us to make conservative inferences about the effect of the presence and lack of contextual ads on purchasing behaviors and outcomes.
   - Field experiments can trade off internal for external validity, being more ecologically valid but permitting a lower degree of control over potential confounding factors. While validating the effects of eliminating behaviorally targeted ads in a field study is part of our research agenda, exploring the phenomena in a controlled experiment was a critical first step.

6. **Second-Order Effects:**
   - Our study does not address potential second-order effects of online ads on consumer welfare, such as the benefits consumers derive from access to free online content supported by ads. Nevertheless, our paper offers empirical insights that encourage further exploration of the impact of ad-blockers on consumer welfare.

### 6 Discussion and Conclusions

We presented the results of a lab experiment investigating the impact of ad-blockers on individuals' online purchase behavior, including the time needed to find products, the amounts spent, and the degree of satisfaction with purchased items, when contextually targeted online ads are shown or blocked.

Overall, we found that the main treatment effects in our experiment were not statistically significant. These null results carry important implications. Participants who were randomly assigned to use ad-blockers did not lose substantially in economic or temporal terms, but they did not gain either. The findings suggest that the removal of contextual ads does not hurt consumers to any meaningful extent along the dimensions we captured (prices paid, satisfaction, and search costs). In essence, although we did not find significant effects, the results indicate that ad-blockers do not have a substantial negative impact on consumer behavior and satisfaction.
