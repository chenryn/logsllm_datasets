spending less time on product searching (Table 3 in S5). Par-
ticipants who reported that the study was difﬁcult spent more
time on product searching. On average, participants spent
more time searching durable and hedonic products or when
they were more involved in the purchase decision. The fre-
quency of product purchasing and self-reported absence of
exposure to brand ads in the 30 days prior to the experiment
were not signiﬁcantly associated with the product search time.
4.3 Effect on Satisfaction
We analyzed participants’ satisfaction with browsing expe-
rience, product choices, prices, and perceived quality. All
measures except satisfaction with browsing experience were
taken twice—immediately after the experiment, for all cho-
sen products (ex-ante), and after physical delivery, for the
purchased product (ex-post).

4.3.3 Satisfaction with product prices
Immediately after the experiment (ex-ante), 66% of the time
participants were satisﬁed with the prices of the chosen prod-
ucts. We found no difference in ex-ante price satisfaction
between experimental conditions (based on the regressions
in Table 7 in S6.3, and bivariate statistical test (t(1665) =
−1.49; p = 0.14)), and between home computer users and
non-users of ad-blockers (t(1665) = 0.67; p = 0.5). However,
the satisfaction was lower for the products chosen using spe-
ciﬁc search queries (t(1665) = 9.4; p = 0.00). Higher prices
and search time negatively affected the ex-ante satisfaction
with the prices. In contrast, ex-ante satisfaction with expected
quality, product durability, and purchase-decision involvement
were positively associated with ex-ante satisfaction with the
prices. Ex-ante satisfaction with the prices of the products
chosen following sponsored Google Shopping listings in the
NoBlock condition was lower than for the products from
organic links (ANOVA: beta = −0.33, p = 0.04).
After the product delivery, 55% of participants in the
NoBlock condition and 69% of participants in the Block
condition were ex-post satisﬁed with the prices of the cho-
sen product they received. The difference in Likert scale re-
sponses is not signiﬁcant (t(154) = −1.82, p = 0.07), and
not robust to the inclusion of the full set of controls (Ta-
ble 8, model 4, in S6.3). The ex-post price satisfaction was
not different between home computer users and non-users
of ad-blockers (t(154) = 0.37, p = 0.71). Speciﬁc search
queries were associated with lower ex-post price satisfac-
tion (t(154) = 4.7, p = 0.00). Prices, search time, purchase-
decision involvement, frequency of product purchasing, dura-
bility, and hedonic nature of the product had no signiﬁcant
association (p > 0.05). Ex-post satisfaction with the product
quality and absence of the prior exposure to brand ads were
associated with a higher degree of ex-post price satisfaction.
Ex-post price satisfaction was lower, but not signiﬁcantly so,
for the products purchased from sponsored Google Shopping
listings (ANOVA: beta = −1.23, p = 0.08) than from organic
links in the NoBlock condition.
4.3.4 Satisfaction with perceived product quality
Immediately after the experiment (ex-ante), 72% of the time in
the NoBlock condition and 69% of the time in the Block con-
dition participants were satisﬁed with the expected quality of
the chosen products. There was no statistically signiﬁcant dif-
ference between conditions (t(1665) = −0.21, p = 0.84) and
between home computer users and non-users of ad-blockers
(t(1665) = 0.96, p = 0.34). According to a bivariate statisti-
cal test, ex-ante satisfaction with the expected quality of the
products chosen using speciﬁc branded search queries was
lower (t(1665) = 7.29, p = 0.00) than for generic searches;
however, this association was not statistically signiﬁcant in the
multivariate regression (Table 9 in S6.4). Price, satisfaction
with price, product durability, frequent product purchasing,
high purchase-decision involvement, hedonic nature of the
product, search time, and prior exposure to brand ads had
no signiﬁcant association with ex-ante quality satisfaction
(p > 0.05). ANOVA demonstrated lower ex-ante satisfaction
with the quality of the products chosen from sponsored bot-
tom (but not top) links (beta = −1.01, p = 0.03) and Google
Shopping listings (beta =−0.68, p = 0.00) relative to organic
links in the NoBlock condition.
After delivery, 68% and 71% of the participants were ex-
post satisﬁed with the quality of purchased products in the
NoBlock and Block conditions, respectively. This degree
of satisfaction did not differ between conditions (t(154) =
−0.25, p = 0.80), or between users and non-users of ad-
blockers on home computers (t(154) = 0.24, p = 0.81). A
negative association between the speciﬁc branded search
queries and satisfaction with the quality of purchased products
was found in the bivariate statistical test (t(154) = 2.81, p =
0.01), but not in the multivariate regression model (Table 10
in S6.4). The only statistically signiﬁcant positive predictors
of the ex-post satisfaction with the quality in the regression
(Table 10 in S6.4) were product durability, frequent product
purchasing, high purchase-decision involvement, and ex-post
satisfaction with the product price. The types of search results
(sponsored or organic) showed no effect.
5 Limitations and Future Work
Before we discuss the ﬁndings and their implications, we
highlight current limitations in the analysis, and ongoing work
aimed at addressing some of those.
First, to preserve internal validity of the study (a priority
of experimental methodology in a lab environment) we asked
participants to search for speciﬁc product types, without mod-
ifying the search queries. However, participants were free to
explore the websites to choose the product, vendor, and price
they liked the most. We also measured and controlled for their
purchase-decision involvement with each product category.
Based on the answers to the Mittal scale [78], “in selecting
from the many types and brands of products available in the
market,” 89% of our participants “cared which one [they]
bought”; for 87% of participants it “was important to make
the right choice of the product”; and 87% of participants were
“concerned about the outcome of [their] choice.” Behavioral

lab research (starting with research on the endowment effect
[55], and continuing up to the present day) successfully uses
seemingly low-involvement goods (e.g., mugs). The study
was incentive-compatible, and participants had to buy the
products using their own credit card and personal details. As
the incentives offered in the experiment are analogous to the
incentives of real-world consumer economic behaviors, the ex-
perimental results are expected to generalize to the real-world
effects, at least to a justiﬁed extent.
Second, signiﬁcant order effect suggests that closer to the
end of experiment participants were spending less time on
the search, however it did not signiﬁcantly affect the prices
of the chosen products. We tried to mitigate time pressure
in our experimental design by informing participants that it
was not important how many products they would eventually
search for and that it would not affect the payment, and by
showing time elapsed rather than a countdown timer. We plan
to test ecological validity of the results in the future ﬁeld
experiment, where we will not impose any time pressure, and
where participants’ purchase decisions will not be restricted
by the experimenter.
Third, in this study we did not consider the differences in
product quality across conditions and categories, which is a
part of our ongoing research efforts.
Fourth, we may have found null treatment effects due to
limited sample size, or short experimental period. However,
we were able to rule out large effects. Moreover, standard
errors on treatment coefﬁcients allow assessing the statistical
power, and demonstrate that we were able to detect effects
larger than conﬁdence intervals with our experimental design
and sample. Due to randomization, the treatment variable is
uncorrelated with model covariates and thus cannot inﬂate
the variance. In contrast, including covariates reduces the
model residual and hence the treatment variable coefﬁcient’s
standard error. Thus, our statistical analysis is rigorous, and
results are robust and internally valid. In future work we plan
to expand both of these dimensions.
Fifth, we focused on contextual ads, rather than be-
haviorally targeted ads. Running a tightly controlled lab-
experiment, with factors other than the treatment manipulation
being kept constant across participants, allowed us to make
conservative inferences about effect of presence and lack of
contextual ads on purchasing behaviors and outcomes.
In contrast, ﬁeld experiments can trade-off internal for ex-
ternal validity: they can be more ecologically valid, but permit
a lower degree of control over potential confounding factors
compared to lab experiments. While validating the effects of
eliminating behaviorally targeted ads in a ﬁeld study is part of
our research agenda, exploring the phenomena in a controlled
experiment was a critical ﬁrst step. Internally valid lab ex-
periments are crucial complements to ecologically valid ﬁeld
experiments, and both methodologies are in fact common in
security research [31, 59].
Finally, our study does not address potential second-order
effects of online ads on consumer welfare (for instance, the
beneﬁts consumers derive from access to free online con-
tent that ads may support). Nevertheless, our paper offers
an empirical insight that encourages us, and hopefully other
researchers, to explore further the impact of ad-blockers on
consumers’ welfare.
6 Discussion and Conclusions
We have presented the results of a lab experiment investigat-
ing the impact of ad-blockers on individuals’ online purchase
behavior, including the time needed to ﬁnd products to pur-
chase online, the amounts spent, and the degree of satisfaction
with purchased items, when contextually targeted online ads
are shown or blocked.
Overall, we found that main treatment effects in our ex-
periment were not statistically signiﬁcant. Such null results
carry an important interpretation and practical implications.
Participants who were randomly assigned to use ad-blockers
did not lose substantially in economic or temporal terms, but
they did not gain either. The ﬁndings suggest that the removal
of contextual ads does not hurt consumers to any meaningful
extent along the dimensions we captured (prices paid, satis-
faction, and search costs). In essence, although we did not
