#### Description

While testing the functionality of disabling a user, I discovered that it is possible to impersonate a disabled user as if they were still active. Specifically, after disabling a user, I was able to successfully impersonate them without any restrictions or alerts.

#### Expected Behavior

I expected that a disabled user should not be able to be impersonated. When attempting to impersonate a disabled user, I anticipated that the system would either prevent the impersonation or provide an appropriate error message indicating that the user is disabled.

#### Actual Behavior

- Impersonating a disabled user works as if the user is still active.
- Logging out and then attempting to log in as the disabled user correctly alerts the user that the account is disabled and prevents login.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Disable a user.
2. Attempt to impersonate the disabled user.
3. Observe that the impersonation is successful without any restrictions.
4. Log out.
5. Attempt to log in as the disabled user.
6. Observe that the system correctly alerts the user that the account is disabled and prevents login.

#### Additional Information

- Symfony version: 3.1
- This behavior is inconsistent with the expected security measures for disabled users.

Is this the expected behavior, or is this a potential security issue that needs to be addressed?
