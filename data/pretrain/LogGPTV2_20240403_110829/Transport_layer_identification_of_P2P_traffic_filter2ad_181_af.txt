### UDP and MPLS Impact on Payload Matching

A UDP header is only 8 bytes, which allows for sufficient payload space to effectively match strings in these packets. In contrast, 60-80% of the packets in our traces are encapsulated with 4-byte MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) headers. MPLS is used by this Tier 1 ISP for routing and traffic engineering purposes. The presence of MPLS headers reduces the number of packets that can be matched against our string table, as a significant amount of traffic has no usable payload due to the 4-byte MPLS header and 40-byte TCP header.

### ISP Caching and P2P Traffic

To mitigate the impact of P2P traffic, ISPs sometimes employ caching of P2.P content, similar to web caching. This practice can significantly reduce upstream traffic, resulting in substantial cost savings for ISPs. However, P2P requests served by these caches do not reach the backbone, leading to a limited view of P2P usage, especially when compared to past years before P2P caching became common.

### P2P and Copyrighted Material

Typically, the majority of P2P traffic involves copyrighted material. Although we cannot equate all P2P traffic with copyrighted content, the dominance of such material in most P2P networks is widely accepted. Our study does not specifically identify trends in the use of P2P networks for exchanging copyrighted material.

### Link Utilization and Time of Day

Traces taken at different times of day can exhibit drastically different characteristics, even if collected from the same link. Most of our traces are captured during business hours, but we also compare traces with varying utilizations and different capture times. We focus on the relative proportion of P2P traffic to the total volume rather than absolute values.

### Conflicting Traffic Engineering Goals

Due to the large volume of P2P traffic, ISPs may manipulate it according to their economic objectives. Networks that pay for transit have an incentive to keep traffic within their boundaries or those of non-charging peers. Conversely, networks that charge for transit may try to attract traffic by adjusting routing and performance metrics. For example, some P2P clients prefer peers with lower round-trip times (RTTs), while others, like BitTorrent, choose peers with the highest bitrate. The increase in peering among cable companies has been attributed to the rise in P2P traffic. Pricing differences between international and domestic traffic can also influence these behaviors, leading to unpredictable link workload changes even under stable conditions.

### Limitations of the Analysis

Many limitations of this analysis, such as varying utilization across traces, are common in Internet measurement studies. These challenges are neither new nor unique to Internet science.

### P2P Traffic Growth

We compare traces D09 from May 2003 (southbound and northbound), D10 from January 2004 (southbound and northbound), D11 from February 2004 (southbound), and D13 from April 2004 (southbound and northbound). We use both payload and non-payload analysis methods. Figure 7 shows the average bitrate of P2P traffic detected by each method for both directions of all traces, presented as a percentage of total traffic volume.

#### Key Observations:

- **P2P Traffic Trends:** Contrary to some claims, P2P traffic in recent traces is either growing or at least comparable to older traces from 2003 and January 2004. This trend is supported by all methodologies for the southbound direction. For the northbound direction, May 2003 and January 2004 volumes are comparable beyond M1 (P2P rate in "known" ports). P2P traffic in the April trace, despite higher total traffic volume, surpasses all other traces.
- **Failure of Conventional Methods:** Using port numbers for traffic classification underestimates P2P traffic by more than 50%, especially in recent traces. This is illustrated by the migration to random port numbers, where the difference between M1 and M2 estimates is minimal in May 2003 but significant in 2004 traces.
- **Payload Size Impact:** Comparing payload estimations with 4-byte and 16-byte payloads for the February and April 2004 traces shows that increasing the payload size can improve robust identification. Estimates using 16 bytes of payload are approximately 17% and 25% for February and April, respectively, while 4-byte payload estimates are considerably lower.

### Methodology Comparison

- **M3 vs. Non-Payload Methodology:** The non-payload algorithm overestimates P2P traffic by about 10% compared to payload estimates. M3 and non-payload estimates are generally comparable, with the non-payload estimates including traffic from three additional protocols discovered during the analysis. This supports the conjecture that M3 in the payload methodology provides a more accurate estimate of P2P traffic.

### Conclusion

P2P traffic has grown to constitute a significant portion of the traffic in our monitored backbone link, confirming that estimations based on a limited number of P2P networks or characteristic port numbers are unrealistic. Our findings also highlight the expanding software alternatives for P2P users, with three previously unknown protocols in our traces being a characteristic example of this increasing diversity.

### Future Work

We plan to extend our algorithm by exploiting bidirectional traces, considering additional heuristics based on specific packet sizes, and using the IP ID field to identify existing connections. We aim to generalize our methodology for more general traffic profiling, as simple port-based application breakdowns have become problematic for most workload characterization tasks.
