### The Economics and Dynamics of Penetration Testing

Penetration testing, or "pen testing," is a service whose value is inversely proportional to its scarcity. Revenue cannot be scaled by increasing the supply of testing services because doing so would undermine the scarcity that underpins the pricing model. This raises the question: "How much penetration testing is enough?" The answer depends on whether one adopts the perspective of the client or the tester.

From the client's standpoint, they desire sufficient testing to ensure the results are credible for advertising purposes, but not so much that the tester fails to find any vulnerabilities, which could suggest the test was too rigorous. Conversely, the tester aims to conduct enough testing to maintain their reputation as a professional whose failure to find flaws is worth a premium. However, if the client's security is weak, the tester must balance thoroughness with the risk of making the process appear too easy or tedious. This dynamic makes optimization challenging.

The adage, "It is the poor carpenter who curses his tools," holds true in penetration testing. The best testers often create their own tools, which serve both to enhance their productivity and to introduce complexity. These custom tools represent the intellectual core of the field, and their proliferation in the market measures the commoditization of the industry. For example, password crackers and network service inventory takers have become so ubiquitous that developing new ones is rarely necessary. When an expert codes their knowledge into a tool, it advances the state of the art, even if unevenly distributed.

### The Future of Penetration Testing

As corporate perimeters dissolve, the target of penetration testing will increasingly be the enterprise itself. The distinction between inside and outside networks will diminish, making the corporate network perimeter less relevant. Penetration testing will evolve to resemble quality assurance, focusing more on falsifying hypotheses about potential flaws and less on discovering unknown vulnerabilities. Only top-tier testers, those who can accurately estimate the effort required for a penetration and quantify risks, will add significant value.

### Application Penetration Testing: A Closer Look

Application penetration testing, being the least commoditized of the major specialties, warrants a closer examination. While specific exploits against applications are well-documented, this section will focus on the broader aspects of application penetration testing, including its justification, methodology, key players, and its role in the development lifecycle.

#### Why Application Penetration Testing?

The rationale for application penetration testing is rooted in the uneven distribution of application security. Historically, the focus has been on infrastructure, assuming that applications were secondary. However, as applications increasingly interact with the public, they have become primary targets for attackers. Statistics from the CSI/FBI survey and the Honeynet Project highlight the critical need for robust application security. Many organizations still underestimate the threat, relying on firewalls and IDS, but penetration testing is essential for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.

#### The Five Wâ€™s of Application Penetration Testing

- **Why?** To ensure the security of applications, especially as they become more exposed.
- **What?** Thorough testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Who?** Skilled testers and developers.
- **When?** Throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Where?** In the context of web applications and other types of software.

By addressing these questions, we can better understand the importance of application penetration testing and its role in enhancing overall security.
