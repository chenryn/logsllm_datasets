User: I need a routine in python to test for a string that contains an absolute path, that is Unix style format. 
So that /home/eduard/tmp/chrome-data-dir/file.ext would be a valid path.
But C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe would not be a valid path.
I need also the path to bet tested not contain characters that might be consider special like: *,?
Assistant: If I understand you, your first example IS an absolute path.  All absolute paths will start with a "/" as they must start at the root directory, and all relative paths will not.  So, just check if your string starts with a "/" using str.startswith('/'). Then, if you want to check if the path is valid, then use os.path.exists().
Your second example is not a *nix path.
