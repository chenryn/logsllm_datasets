User: In a production environment, we found that a large number of network connections were occupied, resulting in high network load and service instability. Please provide a network traffic monitoring plan, including monitoring indicators and alarm settings.
Assistant: Monitoring indicators: 1. Network bandwidth usage 2. Peak network traffic 3. Number of network connections 4. Number of network connections for each IP address Alarm settings: 1. Set the bandwidth usage threshold and trigger an alarm when the threshold is reached. 2. Set the traffic peak threshold and trigger an alarm when the threshold is reached. 3. Set the connection threshold and trigger an alarm when the threshold is reached. 4. Monitor the number of connections of each IP address, if the number of connections of an IP address exceeds the preset threshold, an alarm will be triggered. Alerts should be sent to the administrator's mailbox or mobile phone with detailed alert information including time, metrics, etc. At the same time, certain scripts or commands can be automatically executed to eliminate or reduce network traffic load.
