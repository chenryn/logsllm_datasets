ABSTRACT 
The  fundamental  challenge  facing  security  professionals  is 
preventing losses, be they operational, financial or mission losses. 
As a result, one could argue that security professionals share this 
challenge  with  safety  professionals.  Despite 
their  shared 
challenge, there is little evidence that recent advances that enable 
one community to better prevent losses have been shared with the 
other  for  possible  implementation.  Limitations  in  current  safety 
approaches have led researchers and practitioners to develop new 
models and techniques. These techniques could potentially benefit 
the field of security. This paper describes a new systems thinking 
approach to safety that may be suitable for meeting the challenge 
of securing complex systems against cyber disruptions.  Systems-
Theoretic  Process  Analysis  for  Security  (STPA-Sec)  augments 
traditional security approaches by introducing a top-down analysis 
process  designed  to  help  a  multidisciplinary  team  consisting  of 
security, operations, and domain experts identify and constrain the 
system  from  entering  vulnerable  states  that  lead  to  losses.  This 
new framework shifts the focus of the security analysis away from 
threats as the proximate cause of losses and focuses instead on the 
broader  system  structure  that  allowed  the  system  to  enter  a 
vulnerable  system  state  that  the  threat  exploits  to  produce  the 
disruption leading to the loss.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Rapid developments in software and the rise of software intensive 
systems have produced significant benefits to the global economy 
and  society  as  a  whole.    These  benefits  have  given  rise  to  a 
growing  dependence  on  the  services  provided  by  these  systems 
and  their  corresponding  physical  and  logical  infrastructures.  
Disrupting  or  otherwise  exploiting  these  infrastructures  has 
become  the  goal  of  a  wide  range  of  potential  adversaries.    The 
problem is further aggravated by the fact that disruptions may also 
result  from  unintentional  actions  taken  by  well-intentioned 
operators within the systems themselves.  
Despite increased funding and resources, we do not appear to be 
making satisfactory progress in our ability to secure the complex 
systems  that  we  are  increasingly  able  to  create.  Arguably,  new 
approaches  are  needed.  This  paper  presents  one  such  approach. 
Applying lessons learned from nearly three decades of research in 
safety  engineering  for  complex  systems,  this  paper  presents  a 
modified  version  of  a  new,  more  powerful  hazard  analysis 
technique,  called  System-Theoretic  Process  Analysis  (STPA), 
developed 
of 
STPA,  called  STPA  for  Security  (STPA-Sec),  addresses  the 
growing  problem  of  securing  software  intensive  systems  against 
intentional disruptions.  
Cyber  security  has  largely  been  framed  as  a  tactics  problem, 
focusing  on  how  best  to  defend  networks  and  other  information 
assets against threats.  While necessary, we believe this misses the 
greater  objective  of  securing  the  systems’  ability  to  produce  the 
services and functions society depends on.  Defending networks is 
not an end in itself; rather it is a means to protecting these higher-
level  services  and  missions  against  disruptions.    Reframing  the 
problem  into  one  of  strategy  may  ultimately  produce  better 
outcomes.  In  practice,  this  reframing  involves  shifting  the 
majority of security analysis away from guarding against attacks 
(tactics)  and  more 
socio-technical 
vulnerabilities that allow disruptions to propagate throughout the 
system  (strategy).    Put  another  way,  rather  than  focusing  the 
majority of the security efforts on threats from adversary action, 
which  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  security  specialist,  security 
efforts  should  be  focused  on  the  larger,  more  inclusive  goal  of 
controlling  system  vulnerabilities.  To  accomplish  this  goal, 
STPA-Sec

This  paper  is  organized  into  three  parts.    The  first  section 
discusses  the  limitations  associated  with  treating  cyber  security 
solely  as  a  tactics  problem.    The  second  section  introduces 
systems  thinking  as  a  means  to  reframe  cyber  security  as  a 
strategy  problem  and  presents  a  systems  approach  used 
successfully  to  improve  safety  in  complex  systems.  The  third 
section  of  the  paper  discusses  STPA-Sec  and  presents  a  simple 
example.  
2.   LIMITATIONS IN TREATING CYBER 
SECURITY AS A TACTICS PROBLEM 
The  cyber  security  field  tends  to  draw  heavily  on  language, 
metaphors, 
operations.   
There  is  an  important  distinction  in  military  doctrine  between 
tactics  and  strategy.  Strategy  can  be  considered  as  the  art  of 
gaining and maintaining continuing advantage.  In contrast, tactics 
are  prudent  means  to  accomplish  a  specific  action.  Tactics  are 
focused  on  threats,  while  strategy  models  are  focused  on 
outcomes.   
Most  current  cyber  security  assessments  have  knowingly  or 
unknowingly adopted tactics models.  Tactics models emphasize 
how  best  to  defeat  a  given  threat.    For  example,  a  pilot  has 
specific  tactics  that  should  be  employed  to  defeat  an  adversary 
aircraft  in  combat.    The  threat  dictates  the  tactics  that  will  most 
likely lead to success, so properly identifying the threat is the first 
step in solving the tactical problem. Likewise, analyzing the threat 
is  the  first  step  in  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and 
Technology (NIST) security standards [1].  
In  tactics  models,  losses  are  conceptualized  as  specific  events 
caused by threats.  For example, a security incident consisting of a 
data  breach  with  an  accompanying  loss  of  customer  Personally 
Identifiable  Information  (PII)  is  viewed  as  a  single  occurrence 
where  an  adversary  successfully  precipitates  a  chain  of  events 
leading to a loss.  In almost all such cases, security analysts will 
identify some proximate cause that should have served as the last 
barrier  or  line  of  defense.    According  to  this  model,  if  only  the 
barrier  would  have  been  in  place,  then  the  attack  would  have 
failed.   
This type of approach is often described as “breaking the chain” 
and is a commonly used in security literature as a framework for 
conceptualizing  the  goal  of  successful  security  practices.  In  the 
case of the TJMAXX data loss, for example, the proximate cause 
of the data loss was attributed to the failure of the store to use the 
proper wireless encryption on their networks [2]. Although threats 
exploiting  vulnerabilities  produce  the  loss  event,  tactics  models 
treat the threat as the cause of the loss. According to this thinking, 
the loss is attributed to a threat successfully circumventing several 
barriers  to  reach  its  goal.  Preventing  losses,  then,  is  heavily 
dependent on the degree to which security analysts can correctly 
identify  potential  attackers,  their  motives,  capabilities,  and 
targeting.  Once  equipped  with  this  knowledge,  security  analysts 
can  analyze  their  systems  to  determine  the  most  likely  route  (or 
causal  chain)  attackers  may  take  to  reach  their  goal.    Resources 
can then be allocated to place barriers along the chain and prevent 
losses.  
This  chain-of-events  model  of  causality  is  the  same  one  used  in 
safety  engineering,  where  the  attempt  to  avoid  accidents  is 
focused on breaking the chain by either preventing the individual 
2
failure  events  or  erecting  barriers  between  them  to  prevent  their 
propagation. 
The  current  threat-based  security  approach  succeeds  best  under 
the  same  circumstances  that  allow  tactical  success  on  the 
battlefield: good intelligence and a context where cause and effect 
are  closely  linked  temporally  and  spatially.    Good  intelligence 
reduces uncertainty.  When the means, motives and capabilities of 
potential  attackers  are  so  well  understood  that  their  preferred 
“route” to their goal can be predicted, then security barriers can be 
erected  to  break  the  chain.    In  these  cases,  losses  are  prevented 
when  defenders  skillfully  execute  the  well-established  practices 
and  procedures  the  situation  demands.    An  example  is  network 
administrators  disabling  unused  ports  or  updating  the  latest 
malware signatures.  
A  threat-based  approach  is  useful  for  identifying  and  countering 
security threats against a single, well-defined and well-understood 
system  asset  or  component.    In  these  cases,  a  threat  actor’s 
potential actions might be evaluated through stochastic models to 
yield a most likely course of action to attack the asset.  Once this 
adversary  course  of  action  is  identified,  the  security  analyst  can 
provide  advice  to  senior  leaders  on  how  best  to  allocate  limited 
resources to thwart the attack and break the chain. In other words, 
the high level of threat understanding enables security analysts to 
predict  not  only  where  an  adversary  will  attack,  but  also  the 
logical and physical infrastructure that is most important to defend 
in order to thwart the attack.  
Unfortunately,  this  approach  suffers  significant  limitations  when 
applied 
infrastructure 
supporting  large-scale,  complex  organizational  activities  against 
little  understood  and  rapidly  evolving  adversaries.  The  current 
security  model  doesn't  accommodate  the  properties  of  software 
intensive  systems,  nor  can  the  loss  mechanism  be  accurately 
reflected in a linear causality model.  Losses occur as the result of 
complex 
the  various  socio-technical 
components in modern organizations and businesses.  The loss is 
an  emergent  system  outcome,  not  one  found  in  the  failure  of 
individual components.
