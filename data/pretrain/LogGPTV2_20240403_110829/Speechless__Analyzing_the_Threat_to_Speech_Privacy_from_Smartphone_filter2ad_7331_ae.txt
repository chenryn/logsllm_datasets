Motion Sensors against Loudspeaker: The obtained results
from this setup indicate that motion sensors could possibly be
affected by the speech signals rendered by loudspeaker, when
the loudspeaker setup and the motion sensors are sharing the
same surface. Since the smartphone is in contact with same
surface as the loudspeaker setup, the conductive vibrations
through loudspeaker setup travel through the shared surface to
reach motion sensors. The amount of dampening of conductive

Fig. 7: Comparison of sensor behavior under ambient locations and in presence of live human speech (normal). Maximum
variance in sensor readings (in absence of speech) at quiet locations 1, 2, 3, 4 is plotted along side maximum variance in
sensor readings (in presence of speech) to determine the effect of speech on sensors. The blue line (maximum variance in
presence of speech) closely follows rest of the lines (that represent maximum variance in absence of speech) indicating similar
behavior of sensors in quiet locations and against normal human voice.

vibrations depends on the surface material though no notice-
able effect was seen in our experiments up to a distance of 4
feet on a wooden table surface. Similar conductive vibration
effects have also been reported in another attack vector [3]
where vibrations associated with user’s key presses, travel over
to a smartphone close by kept on the same surface as the
computer.
In the scenario where the loudspeaker and the smartphone
did not share a surface, in contrast, the obtained gyroscope
readings show similar behavior as when taken under quiet
conditions, that lead to the conclusion that gyroscope sensor
remains unaffected by the loudspeaker in this scenario. Similar
results from the examination of the accelerometer readings
point that the motion sensors possibly remain unaffected in
this scenario. Since this scenario was designed to have no
direct or indirect contact between the loudspeaker and the
smartphone (except for perhaps the ground), it removes the
medium of transfer for the conductive vibrations while the
acoustic vibrations can still travel through the air. Thus, we
believe that it were the conductive vibrations that affected the
motion sensor readings. In addition, we believe that acoustic
vibrations are unable to produce a signiﬁcant impact on the
motion sensors as observed by the lack of a response in
the Loudspeaker-Different-Surface scenario. Therefore, we can
also assume that the behavior observed in [1] may have been
due to (indirect) conductive vibrations as opposed to (direct)
acoustic vibrations.
Motion Sensors against Laptop Speaker: In this scenario
(Laptop-Same-Surface), we observed that only accelerometer
was slightly affected by low frequency tones but speech signals
rendered by laptop speakers were not powerful enough to
induce a response in both gyroscope and accelerometer.
Motion Sensors against Phone Speaker: In this scenario
(Phone-Different-Surface), we observed no signiﬁcant impact
on gyroscope and accelerometer due to the speech signals
transmitted from the phone speaker. Since this scenario is a
weaker setting than the loudspeaker setup due to the fact that

phone speakers lack the loudness and the richness of the sound
produced by a loudspeaker, this result seems to indicate that
the motion sensors may remain unaffected by speech signals
produced from smartphone speakers.
Motion Sensors against Normal Human Voice: The results
from this scenario (Human-Normal) indicate that
there is
minimal variation in the sensor readings when compared
against the sensor readings taken in absence of speech, leading
us to believe that human speech in normal conversational tone
may be unable to produce signiﬁcant response in the motion
sensor readings.
Motion Sensors against Loud Human Voice: This sce-
nario (Human-Loud) involved much louder human speech
and showed similar behavior for the motion sensors that
was observed in the previous scenario (Human-Normal). The
results leads to the notion that even loud human speech may
not be strong enough on its own to have a signiﬁcant impact
on the motion sensors that are embedded in the smartphones.
All these results seem to indicate that direct acoustic vibra-
tions are unable to affect the motion sensors while traveling
through air. However, it is possible for other sounds such
as high frequency audio signals to affect gyroscope and
accelerometer as shown in [12], [13], [14], [15]. The difference
lies in the frequencies and power levels of the audio signals
used to inﬂuence the motion sensors. While the fundamental
frequency for speech is in the range 85-180 Hz (male) and
165-255 Hz (female), the audio signal used in prior work has
been near the resonant frequencies of the motion sensors and
around high sound pressure level of 90dB and above.
Accelerometer vs. Gyroscope: An interesting insight from
our experimental results (Table I) is that the accelerometer
seems to be more sensitive towards conductive vibrations than
the gyroscope. This behavior may be due to the reason that
in all our setups, the smartphone was placed on a ﬂat surface.
Thus, linear motion along x, y axes may be natural (as captured
by the accelerometer), while rotation along x and y axes may
be restricted (as captured by the gyroscope) due to the surface
on which the smartphone is resting.
VIII. POTENTIAL FUTURE WORK
We showed that motion sensors seem to get impacted by
the speech signal only in certain scenarios depending upon
the source of speech generation, the medium of transfer and
sound pressure level. For such scenarios, future work may
be conducted, applying machine learning methods similar to
the work done in [1], in order to detect and classify the
speech impact to achieve speaker and gender identiﬁcation in
frequency domain. To further strengthen the role of conductive
vibrations in the success of attacks that exploit motion sensors
for compromising speech privacy,
in the threat scenarios
examined in this work, such vibrations could be measured
via Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). Correlating the surface
vibrations with the motion sensor readings would reafﬁrm the
role played by conductive vibrations in such attacks.
Increasing the sampling rate of the motion sensors may
help them capture and record more information. This effect
can be achieved by using motion sensors that have a higher
sampling rate, though operating systems could be tempted to
limit the sampling rate as a security measure. Another way to
increase the sampling rate would be to consider a more relaxed
threat model where the adversary has the capability to override
the limit imposed by the operating system on the sampling
rate of the motion sensors via a covert malware application.
It is also possible for future generations of smartphones to
have an increased sampling rate for motion sensors for better
accuracy. This feature will possibly lead to better accuracy for
the adversary in the discussed threat scenarios and hence any
such design decisions need to be taken keeping such factors
in mind. The use of multiple sensors in a fashion similar to an
array of time interleaved data converters (interleaved ADCs)
could also be used to artiﬁcially ramp up the sampling rate as
also suggested in [1], [27]. This line of work would be another
interesting item for possible future work.
Further work may also explore other side-channel attacks
against motion sensors present in the research literature (e.g.
[3], [18], [17], [28], [29], [30]), and how it would affect
the attack feasibility if these attacks were to be extended to
different novel scenarios, in line with the theme of our work.
We believe such a discussion is necessary in order to enrich the
threat assessment of side-channel attacks on motion sensors
under different setups.
IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this work, we conducted a threat analysis of the motion
sensors embedded in current smartphone platforms against
speech signals. In particular, we examined the possibility of
compromising the speech privacy of a user by exploiting the
motion sensor data in a covert fashion. We conducted our
study covering many possible attack scenarios and analyzed
the behavior of the motion sensors under all these scenarios.
Taking into account the performed investigation, we reached
the conclusion that the threat levels perceived due to motion
sensors’ recording of speech signals depend on a number of
factors and seem mostly due to result of conductive vibrations
produced by the speech generating device. The impact of the
studied threat under the designed scenarios therefore limits
itself to only speciﬁc settings. Further work must be conducted
similar to the threat scenarios designed in this work to assess
other computing platforms and paradigms that
incorporate
motion sensors against speech privacy vulnerability, or lack
thereof (e.g., the embedded devices in the IoT space or an
aggregation of multiple devices with multiple motion sensors).
