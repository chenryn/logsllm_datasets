### Summary of Results (Table I)

**Impact of Motion Sensors on Loudspeaker:**
Our results from this setup suggest that motion sensors can be influenced by speech signals emitted by a loudspeaker when both the loudspeaker and the motion sensors are placed on the same surface. Since the smartphone is in contact with the same surface as the loudspeaker, conductive vibrations from the loudspeaker travel through the shared surface to reach the motion sensors. The degree of dampening of these conductive vibrations depends on the surface material; however, no noticeable effect was observed in our experiments up to a distance of 4 feet on a wooden table. Similar conductive vibration effects have been reported in other attack vectors, such as those involving vibrations from key presses traveling to a nearby smartphone.

**Loudspeaker and Smartphone on Different Surfaces:**
In contrast, when the loudspeaker and the smartphone did not share a surface, the gyroscope readings were similar to those taken under quiet conditions, indicating that the gyroscope sensor remains unaffected in this scenario. Similarly, the accelerometer readings showed no significant change, suggesting that the motion sensors are likely unaffected in this setup. This scenario was designed to eliminate direct or indirect contact between the loudspeaker and the smartphone, thus removing the medium for conductive vibrations while allowing acoustic vibrations to travel through the air. Based on these observations, we conclude that it is the conductive vibrations, rather than acoustic vibrations, that affect the motion sensor readings.

**Impact of Motion Sensors on Laptop Speaker:**
In the Laptop-Same-Surface scenario, only the accelerometer was slightly affected by low-frequency tones, but the speech signals from the laptop speakers were not powerful enough to induce a response in either the gyroscope or the accelerometer.

**Impact of Motion Sensors on Phone Speaker:**
In the Phone-Different-Surface scenario, no significant impact was observed on the gyroscope and accelerometer due to the speech signals transmitted from the phone speaker. Given that phone speakers are less powerful and produce less rich sound compared to a loudspeaker, this result suggests that motion sensors may remain unaffected by speech signals from smartphone speakers.

**Impact of Motion Sensors on Normal Human Voice:**
The results from the Human-Normal scenario indicate minimal variation in sensor readings compared to those taken in the absence of speech. This suggests that normal conversational human speech does not produce a significant response in the motion sensors.

**Impact of Motion Sensors on Loud Human Voice:**
The Human-Loud scenario, which involved much louder human speech, showed similar behavior to the Human-Normal scenario. The results indicate that even loud human speech may not be strong enough to significantly impact the motion sensors embedded in smartphones.

**Overall Observations:**
These results suggest that direct acoustic vibrations traveling through the air do not significantly affect motion sensors. However, high-frequency audio signals, as shown in previous studies, can influence the gyroscope and accelerometer. The difference lies in the frequencies and power levels of the audio signals used to influence the motion sensors. While the fundamental frequency for speech ranges from 85-180 Hz (male) and 165-255 Hz (female), the audio signals in prior work were near the resonant frequencies of the motion sensors and at high sound pressure levels of 90 dB and above.

**Accelerometer vs. Gyroscope:**
An interesting insight from our experimental results (Table I) is that the accelerometer appears to be more sensitive to conductive vibrations than the gyroscope. This may be because, in all our setups, the smartphone was placed on a flat surface, allowing linear motion along the x and y axes (captured by the accelerometer) while restricting rotational motion (captured by the gyroscope).

### Potential Future Work
Future work could involve applying machine learning methods to detect and classify the impact of speech on motion sensors, achieving speaker and gender identification in the frequency domain. To further investigate the role of conductive vibrations, measurements could be taken using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). Increasing the sampling rate of motion sensors, either through hardware improvements or by overriding operating system limitations, could also enhance the detection capabilities. Additionally, exploring other side-channel attacks against motion sensors and their feasibility in different scenarios would enrich the threat assessment of such attacks.

### Concluding Remarks
In this study, we conducted a threat analysis of motion sensors embedded in smartphones against speech signals, examining various attack scenarios. Our findings indicate that the threat levels perceived due to motion sensors recording speech signals depend on several factors, primarily the presence of conductive vibrations. The impact of the studied threats is limited to specific settings. Further research should be conducted to assess the vulnerability of other computing platforms and paradigms that incorporate motion sensors, such as IoT devices or multiple-device systems.
