Session 1A: Anonymous Routing and Censorship CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA62A APPENDIX: EVALUATION
In this appendix, we provide an evaluation of the different anom-
aly detection techniques and the censorship smoothing. We also
provide some additional details on comparison between different
censorship measurement platforms.
A.1 Anomaly Detection Evaluation
We perform different trials with varying thresholds for various
anomaly detection techniques (§5.3.2). The MAD technique uses
the deviation from the median as an anomaly score, while the
likelihood model uses the likelihood of an element’s probability
in a particular distribution. The exponentially weighted moving
average model calculates a weighted moving average over a sliding
window and uses the deviation from the mean to assign anomaly
scores. The Bitmap-based model discretizes the data into bitmaps
and calculates the distance between two bitmaps as anomaly scores.
Our goal is to minimize the percentage of anomalies while max-
imizing the amount of useful censorship events detected. This is
difficult since there is little censorship ground truth to compare.
Therefore, we manually compile a list of ten key censorship events
we identified from Censored Planet data manually (described in
§7.1) and observe how many of the events can be detected automat-
ically at different thresholds for each technique.
Our evaluation is shown in Table 2. We report anomaly percent-
ages for a time series that is drilled down to a per-category and
per-country level, for which the raw number of observations is in
the order of 106 and the raw number of anomalies is in the order
of 104 at the optimum level. While all of the detection techniques
perform comparatively well, the Likelihood-based and MAD-based
techniques consistently found a larger number of anomalies, prob-
ably because the techniques detect smaller events in periods of
minimal change. The Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and
the Bitmap-based anomaly detection techniques detect compara-
tively lower number of anomalies. The Bitmap method performs
slightly better, especially at finding most of the known censorship
events. Therefore, we report the top four events found using the
Bitmap technique in Table 1.
Additionally, we observed an average overlap of 58.97 % between
comparable thresholds of the MAD, Bitmap and EWMA techniques,
indicating that a voting scheme may be used in the future to detect
the most important anomalies. The anomaly detection process is
online and completely automated, although there is effort involved
in exploring causes for censorship change once the top anomalies
have been identified.
A.2 Censorship Smoothing Evaluation
In §6.3, we evaluated the high variation in raw censorship values
in countries with heterogeneous censorship policies, highlighting
the importance of the smoothed representative censorship measure
we introduced in §5.2. In Figure 10, we show that the smoothed
censorship metric is effective in reducing the volatility of the raw
