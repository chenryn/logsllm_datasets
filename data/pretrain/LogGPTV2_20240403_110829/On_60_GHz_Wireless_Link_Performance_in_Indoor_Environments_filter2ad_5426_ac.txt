1 Gbps. However, performance of individual orientations varies widely across
locations: standard deviation in goodput is > 0.5Gbps for a majority (14 out of
16) of orientations and the mean goodput between diﬀerent orientations diﬀers
by up to 1.3 Gbps. Thus, an orientation that works well in one location need not
work well in another. This behavior is also visible in Figure 3(b): nine orienta-
tions (#5-11 and #14-15) provide > 1Gbps mean goodput in one location while
providing zero goodput in the other location.
Diﬀerent heights and the X-Z plane: In many real-world deployments (e.g.
indoor enterprise WLANs), communicating entities are at diﬀerent heights. Fur-
ther, the antenna array can be oriented in the X-Z plane as well. This prompts
us to place the TX and RX at diﬀerent heights at three locations and measure
the performance when the TX and RX antenna arrays are oriented in the X-
Y and X-Z planes. In Figure 5(b), we compare these measurements with those
when the TX and RX were at the same height, across orientations in the X-Y
plane. When the nodes are at diﬀerent heights, mean goodput with X-Y plane
orientation is much lower than that with X-Z orientation. In fact, even when the
nodes are at the same height, for some locations (Idx. #0 and #1), this is the
case. Thus, sensitivity to X-Z plane orientations should also be considered.
Importance of orienting towards the other side: To expand on the beneﬁt of
using orientation index #0 (see Figure 3), Figure 6(a) breaks down link goodput
across all locations into when (a) both, (b) at least one, and (c) neither antenna
array(s) are pointing towards the other side. Even when one antenna array is
oriented towards the other side, goodput is greater than 1.5 Gbps 85% of the
time with a median goodput of 1.7 Gbps. Further, when neither antenna array
is aligned, goodput is 0 over 50% of the time!
Beneﬁt of using multiple antenna arrays: One way of mitigating antenna array
orientation mis-match is to use multiple antenna arrays at each node and dynam-
ically selecting amongst them at run-time. Figure 6(b) shows the feasibility of
such an approach by plotting the link goodput across all locations when one side
(e.g. access point (AP)) chooses from amongst four antenna arrays correspond-
ing to the four TX/RX orientations in the X-Y plane. Note that the other side
(e.g. the client) can choose any orientation. By choosing antenna array #3, the
AP can recover a signiﬁcant portion of performance loss due to antenna array
orientation mis-match in the X-Y plane.

Robustness to Human-body Blockage: We also design two experiments to
study the behavior of 60 GHz transmissions in the presence of light and heavy
human activity. The ﬁrst experiment is conducted in a corridor with light human
activity (occasional blockage by 1-2 human bodies). The second experiment is
conducted during an informal tea-time gathering of people in a room (10m x
6m x 3m); on average 25-30 people were moving/standing in the room between
the TX and the RX that were placed at two diagonally opposite corners of the
room, oriented towards each other. The TX-RX channel is LOS in the absence of
people. In each case, the transfer was done for 15 minutes and people were kept
unaware of the experiments to avoid inﬂuencing the results. Goodput results for
both experiments are shown in Figure 7(a)). Beamsteering is quite robust to light
human activity. With heavy human activity, while goodput ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly
in Figure 7(a), it is still high for long periods of time with a mean of 1.68Gbps.
When connectivity is lost, the transceivers perform re-beamforming and restart
transfers. To measure the re-beamforming delay, we repeat the experiment in
the absence of people but with explicit manual re-alignment of the receiver from
time to time. Figure 7(b) shows the re-beamforming delay for the current hard-
ware implementation takes upto six seconds. Due to limited access to the 60Ghz
transceivers at this level, we cannot completely justify the reason for such high
delay to re-adjust the beam. However, we believe that the current implemen-
tation is primarily designed for static settings and that future implementations
will react faster and reduce these delays signiﬁcantly.
Robustness to Mobility (Preliminary): In Figure 7(c), we report goodput
performance with walking mobility in nine locations (indoor and outdoor) with
LOS between the TX and RX that have up to ∼20m distance between them.
In each location, the RX moves at about 0.5 m/s, starting at the TX, and had
LOS. In the “Circle1” and “Circle2” cases, TX-RX distance was ∼5m, and we
do not see any negative eﬀects of orientation mis-match. For simplicity, in all
other cases the TX and RX were oriented towards each other. Results indicate
that 60 GHz radios can adapt to walking mobility with LOS.
Implications for Next-Generation Gigabit WLANs: Presto currently uses
60 GHz radios from one manufacturer restricting our evaluation to a single im-
plementation of beamsteering and PHY-layer conﬁguration. This is primarily
due to the unavailability of COTS 60 Ghz radios from other manufacturers.
However, our preliminary experiments reveal a LOS range of 25m amd NLOS
range of ∼6m in an indoor enterprise setting. Since the current implementation
uses the highest PHY bit-rate, we anticipate that both ranges should improve
via the use of lower bit-rates (via more robust modulation and coding). Taken
together with the rest of our results, 60Ghz radios show strong potential for use
in either (a) high-density gigabit WLANs (where APs are placed tens of meters
apart) and/or (b) WLANs in conjunction with Wiﬁ to increase capacity.
Moreover, since Presto is designed to work with any 60 Ghz wireless HDMI
radio, it can be used to measure performance for radios from multiple vendors
once they are available, and we expect to see similar results. This work opens up
156

interesting and challenging questions for future work: (a) what about adaptation
to mobility and human-body blockage in light of sensitivity to orientation?, (b)
how well can these radios deal with co-channel interference? (c) while MAC
scheduling [22,9] may mitigate deafness concerns in single-cell WLANs, what
about coordinated/uncoordinated multi-cell networks?
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we study the link-level performance of state-of-the-art 60 GHz
radios in the context of robustness to blockage by walls, cubicles, and human-
bodies, adaptation to walking-speeds mobility, as well as sensitivity to antenna
array orientation. We make the following key observations: (1) 60 GHz radios
are able to overcome NLOS blockage due to walls and cubicles; their coverage
range is reduced relative to LOS scenarios but could still be enough to satisfy
the needs of dense WLANs. (2) Antenna array orientation has a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on performance even in the presence of indoor multipath reﬂections; mitigation
strategies that add to the single antenna array at each node and dynamically se-
lect amongst them show potential to address this issue. (3) Finally, beamsteering
is eﬀective in adapting to low levels of human-body blockage and LOS mobility
at walking speeds; existing implementations need to react faster in the presence
of high levels of dynamically-occurring human-body blockage.
