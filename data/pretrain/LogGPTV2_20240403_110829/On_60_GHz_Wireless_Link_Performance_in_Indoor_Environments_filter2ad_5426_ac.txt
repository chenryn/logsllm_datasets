# 60 GHz Wireless Link Performance in Indoor Environments

## 1. Introduction
This paper evaluates the link-level performance of state-of-the-art 60 GHz radios in indoor environments, focusing on robustness to blockage by walls, cubicles, and human bodies, adaptation to walking-speed mobility, and sensitivity to antenna array orientation.

## 2. Experimental Setup and Results

### 2.1 Goodput with Light and Heavy Human Activity
**Figure 7(a)** shows the goodput over time for both light and heavy human activity. The results indicate that beamsteering is robust to light human activity, while goodput fluctuates significantly with heavy human activity but remains high for extended periods, with a mean of 1.68 Gbps.

### 2.2 Re-Beamforming Delay
**Figure 7(b)** illustrates the re-beamforming delay, which can take up to six seconds in the current hardware implementation. This delay is likely due to the design being optimized for static settings, and future implementations are expected to reduce these delays.

### 2.3 Goodput with LOS Mobility at Walking Speeds
**Figure 7(c)** reports the goodput performance with walking mobility in nine locations (indoor and outdoor) with LOS between the TX and RX. The results show that 60 GHz radios can adapt to walking mobility with LOS, particularly in scenarios where the TX and RX are oriented towards each other.

### 2.4 Sensitivity to Antenna Array Orientation
The performance of individual orientations varies widely across locations. **Figure 3(b)** shows that nine orientations provide > 1 Gbps mean goodput in one location while providing zero goodput in another. The mean goodput between different orientations can differ by up to 1.3 Gbps, indicating that an orientation that works well in one location may not work well in another.

### 2.5 Different Heights and X-Z Plane Orientations
In real-world deployments, communicating entities may be at different heights, and the antenna array can be oriented in the X-Z plane. **Figure 5(b)** compares the performance when the TX and RX are at different heights and oriented in the X-Y and X-Z planes. The results show that mean goodput with X-Y plane orientation is much lower than that with X-Z orientation, even when the nodes are at the same height.

### 2.6 Importance of Orienting Towards the Other Side
**Figure 6(a)** breaks down link goodput across all locations based on whether both, at least one, or neither antenna array is pointing towards the other side. Even when one antenna array is oriented towards the other side, goodput is greater than 1.5 Gbps 85% of the time with a median goodput of 1.7 Gbps. When neither antenna array is aligned, goodput is 0 over 50% of the time.

### 2.7 Benefit of Using Multiple Antenna Arrays
Using multiple antenna arrays at each node and dynamically selecting among them can mitigate orientation mismatch. **Figure 6(b)** shows that by choosing antenna array #3, the AP can recover a significant portion of performance loss due to orientation mismatch in the X-Y plane.

## 3. Implications for Next-Generation Gigabit WLANs
Presto currently uses 60 GHz radios from one manufacturer, limiting our evaluation to a single implementation of beamsteering and PHY-layer configuration. Preliminary experiments reveal a LOS range of 25 meters and NLOS range of ~6 meters in an indoor enterprise setting. Future work should address:
- Adaptation to mobility and human-body blockage in light of orientation sensitivity.
- Handling co-channel interference.
- MAC scheduling in coordinated/uncoordinated multi-cell networks.

## 4. Conclusion
We have studied the link-level performance of 60 GHz radios in indoor environments, focusing on robustness to blockage, adaptation to walking-speed mobility, and sensitivity to antenna array orientation. Key observations include:
1. 60 GHz radios can overcome NLOS blockage due to walls and cubicles, with coverage range reduced but still sufficient for dense WLANs.
2. Antenna array orientation significantly affects performance, and mitigation strategies using multiple antenna arrays show potential.
3. Beamsteering is effective in adapting to low levels of human-body blockage and LOS mobility at walking speeds, though existing implementations need to react faster to high levels of dynamic blockage.
