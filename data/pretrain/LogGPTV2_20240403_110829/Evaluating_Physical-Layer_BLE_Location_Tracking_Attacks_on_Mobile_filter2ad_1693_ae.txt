### Figure 19: Ground Truth vs. Toolkit Detection
The blue bar in Figure 19 represents the actual time when the person was inside the house during the observed hour. The attacker's identification toolkit runs every 10 seconds, and the red bar indicates the periods during which the toolkit detected the presence of the person. The bars match almost perfectly, except for a 50-second period just before minute 10, where the toolkit falsely detected the person's presence, even though they had not yet returned.

### VI. Countermeasures

#### Defending Against BLE Location Tracking
BLE location tracking based on hardware impairments cannot be mitigated by simple software or firmware updates, as these properties are inherent to the RF signal chain. 

One potential defense involves rethinking the design of the BLE chipset's signal chain. We propose adding a random, time-varying frequency offset to the crystal oscillator. This would make the Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) measured at the receiver unpredictable and time-varying. Since BLE has a large CFO tolerance (150 kHz), this additional frequency shift should not affect packet decoding.

Another defense that does not require hardware modifications is to leverage the fact that CFO changes significantly with the internal temperature of the device. By running a background process that randomly varies the computational workload, the CFO can be made to vary over time. However, this approach may lead to inconsistent battery consumption and, if the device temperature remains elevated, it could reduce battery life over time [20].

#### BLE MAC-Layer Fingerprinting
At its core, BLE's design makes MAC-layer fingerprinting difficult. Although BLE advertisements contain a unique 6-byte MAC address, the protocol includes built-in cryptographic MAC randomization. Prior research has confirmed that mobile devices correctly implement this randomization, changing their MAC addresses every 10-15 minutes [5], [26].

However, several studies have shown that privacy attacks can still be performed by deriving identifiers from packet contents that are not reset after MAC randomization. These attacks have been demonstrated for both WiFi and BLE radios [32], [33], [5], [25], [11]. Despite this, such attacks are limited because they require continuous monitoring and rely on identifiers that can be removed through software updates.

#### Physical-Layer Fingerprinting
RF fingerprinting using hardware impairments is a well-studied field. Researchers have analyzed various signal properties such as CFO, I/Q offset/imbalance, and signal transients [9], [39], [17], [23], [35], [24], [4]. Recent approaches have also utilized deep learning methods [16], [42], [27] to fingerprint these properties. For example, the transient portion of the signal has been proposed as a unique signature for wireless devices [38], [13], including Bluetooth signals [18]. However, the transient portion of BLE and Bluetooth signals is only about 2 microseconds, which is insufficient for unique device identification among many devices.

Modulation-shape features have also been explored for RF fingerprinting, such as in RFID transponders [14]. However, the Gaussian shape in GFSK modulation of BLE signals is typically generated digitally in personal electronic devices, making it unsuitable as a unique fingerprint. In WiFi literature, CFO and I/Q imperfections are recognized as the most separable features for fingerprinting [9]. Despite similarities in architecture and hardware impairments, there is limited work on RF fingerprinting of BLE chipsets due to the lack of long known sequences and pilots in BLE transmissions [34], [40].

### VIII. Conclusion

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of physical-layer tracking attacks on BLE-enabled mobile devices. We found that many popular mobile devices transmit hundreds of BLE beacons per second, effectively acting as tracking beacons for their users. We developed a tool to automate the recovery of these features and used it to determine the challenges an attacker would face in using BLE to track a target. While low-cost SDRs can capture physical-layer fingerprints, these identities may be difficult to capture due to differences in transmission power, instability due to temperature variations, and similarity to other devices of the same make and model. Some devices may also lack certain identifying features if they use low-power radio architectures.

By evaluating the practicality of this attack in real-world settings, such as coffee shops, we found that certain devices have unique fingerprints and are particularly vulnerable to tracking, while others have common fingerprints and are often misidentified. Overall, BLE does present a location tracking threat for mobile devices, but an attacker's ability to track a specific target is largely a matter of luck.
