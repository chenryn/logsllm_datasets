Testing using saline solution, we used two setups. We
ﬁrst arranged the leads in an arc and completely submerged
the device in the saline solution. We injected signals with
a maximum amplitude of 50 V p–p, but we were unable to
cause pacing inhibition with submerged devices, although
our attenuated signal was observed on the EGM. In a second

IV. MODULATED ATTACK METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS
Devices lacking low-pass ﬁlters are more sensitive to
EMI because they do not attenuate signals outside of the
baseband, and thus can act as efﬁcient receivers for high-
frequency signals close to the circuit’s resonant frequency.
This work focuses on microphones as example of unﬁltered
devices; ﬁrst outlining a reverse AM tuning method to locate
the resonant frequency and then demonstrating the injection
of: DTMF tones, music, speech, and audio test waveforms.
We use the Speech Transmission Index [28] and the Shazam
service based on spectral ﬁngerprinting [29] to evaluate the
strength and ﬁdelity of injected signals.
A. Finding the resonant frequency
The conducting path between a microphone and the
accompanying ampliﬁcation circuit can act as an antenna, as
discussed in Section II. This creates a likely entry point for
signal injection. To launch a successful attack, an adversary
must ﬁnd a frequency satisfying two conditions on the target
circuit: (1) suitable for demodulation of the baseband signal,
(2) close enough to the resonant frequency to induce a high
voltage. It is difﬁcult to calculate the frequency responses of
the conducting path and other circuit components, especially
if no technical details are available. However, an attacker can
measure the resonant frequency empirically, possibly with
partial information of the device, such as the length of the
conducting path.
Based on the technical details available and analysis
necessary to develop an injected waveform, modulated EMI
attacks fall into three categories: black box, gray box, and
white box. We tested each class of attack using a signal
generator that operates in the 9.00 kHz–2.02 GHz frequency
range to modulate and transmit signals. The baseband
waveforms used include a simple 440 Hz sinusoid, and an
arbitrary audio waveform called the “Weezer” waveform
after the band that produced the sample [30].
1) Black box with no technical details: We ﬁrst used
a webcam (Logitech Quickcam Ultravision) with a camera
and microphone integrated into a single enclosure. With no
directly observable indication of the conducting path length
between the microphone and the ampliﬁer, we could not
approximate the resonant frequency. For all experiments, we
connected the webcam to a laptop to capture the audio output

setup with only the bipolar leads tips in the solution and the
device in free air, conﬁgured to sense in bipolar mode, we
can inhibit pacing at a range of 2 cm to 3 cm.
We also tested the the Medtronic InSync Sentry implanted
in the synthetic human. For these tests, a cardiologist used
the common approach by threading the leads through the
axillary vein under the left clavicle
[27]. The tip of the
lead was guided inside the model heart. With the saline
solution ﬂowing through the model at approximately 60 bpm,
we were able to inhibit pacing only using the modulated
sinusoid signal with an amplitude of 50 V p–p at a range
not exceeding 8 cm from the leads.
Deﬁbrillation shocks. For the ﬁbrillation test, we used
the Medtronic InSync Sentry in free air and saline, along
with the 421 waveform as mentioned above. A snapshot of
the response as displayed by the programmer is shown in
Figure 8 (Bottom) with markers showing ﬁbrillation sense
(FS) events and a deﬁbrillation (FD) event after the onset
of the EMI signal. With our 10 W ampliﬁer, the median
maximum range was 1.67 m in free air, and the results were
negative in saline solution. These results indicate that an
attack is possible with the waveform we used, but a power
source greater than 10 W would be needed.

  transmitting equipment, we modiﬁed the circuit by ﬁtting
15 cm wires between the microphone and the rest of the
board. We then measured the induced voltage on the leads
as we swept the EMI signals from 9.00 kHz to 2.02 GHz
with the output at 20 mW and the transmitting antenna less
than 1 m from the the MicaZ mote. The mote digitized the
measured audio from the sensor board and forwarded the
data to a laptop via a second mote acting as a base station.
Results: By ﬁrst measuring the voltage at the wires, we
noted a peak around 83 MHz and conﬁrmed the suitability
of this carrier frequency for signal injection by modulating
a single 440 Hz tone and recovering it at the application
layer. When we tested the Weezer waveform the recovered
waveform was recognizable, but the Shazam service was
unable to retrieve the record, possibly due to the change in
pitch and speed resulting from the mote’s primitive codec.
We also noticed that an efﬁcient whip antenna for 83 MHz
should be about 6 times longer than the wires we used. This
mismatch suggests that estimating the resonant frequency
based only on the length of the conducting path may not be a
reliable technique. The unknown impedance of the receiving
circuit may alter the expected resonant frequency sufﬁciently
to require a manual frequency sweep in some cases.
B. Dominating a legitimate signal
It is difﬁcult to inject forged signals that can remove
legitimate signals because cancellation requires a high-
ﬁdelity model for the waveforms arriving at the sensor.
Instead, an attacker can inject a powerful forged signal to
dominate the legitimate signal. In systems with automatic
gain control, powerful injected signals could force the gain
to be automatically reduced to avoid circuit saturation. As a
result, the legitimate signal experiences fading.
There are two possible outcomes for an attacker attempt-
ing to overwhelm a legitimate signal: (1) The legitimate
signal is low and the injected signal dominates, leading
to a successful attack; (2) The legitimate signal is high
and the injected signal cannot completely dominate without
saturating the ampliﬁer. In this case, the attack acts as a
simple denial of service resulting in distorted audio.
To quantify the effectiveness of modulated EMI attacks,
we use the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) deﬁned as
SIR = 10 × log10(
PSignal
PInterf erence
)
(5)
where PSignal and PInterf erence are the power levels of the
measured signal and the induced forged signal respectively.
The SIR quantiﬁes how much stronger the legitimate signal
is relative to the injected signal. A negative SIR indicates
that the injected signal is stronger than the legitimate one
and the legitimate signal is difﬁcult to recognize.
Results. We used an audio tone (440 Hz) as the legitimate
signal and a single tone (550 Hz) modulated over the reso-
nant 826 MHz carrier as the EMI signal. Figure 10 shows the
Figure 9. Power spectral density of the recovered 440Hz tone modulated
on a range of carrier frequencies. The 820 MHz to 840 MHz range showed
a high response, indicating that carriers within that band are likely to
successfully inject signals.
and ﬁxed the signal generator’s output power at 80 mW. For
short-range experiments, we used a whip antenna placed
within 20 cm of the webcam. For longer-range experiments,
we used a dipole antenna with higher gain to obtain the same
results from ∼1 m away.
Results: Figure 9 shows the amplitude of the received
signal when modulating a single 440 Hz tone onto a range
of carrier frequencies. This test revealed that the webcam’s
resonant frequency was between 820 MHz and 840 MHz.
We next attempted to inject an arbitrary waveform by
modulating the Weezer waveform onto a frequency in the
resonant range. The commercial Shazam service, which uses
a spectral ﬁngerprinting method to identify audio samples,
correctly identiﬁed the recovered waveform, indicating that
the audio was clear enough to be recognized.
2) Gray box with limited technical details: We next found
the resonant frequency of a Bluetooth headset (Plantronics
Voyager 510) based on partial information of the circuit.
A disassembly revealed that the microphone–ampliﬁer con-
ducting path was approximately 6 cm, which corresponds
to a resonant frequency of approximately 1.25 GHz if we
model the conducting path as a whip antenna. Thus, instead
of the entire frequency range, we swept the carrier frequency
from 1.0 to 1.5 GHz to pinpoint the resonant frequency. The
output of the signal generator was ﬁxed at 20 mW and we
positioned the transmitting antenna 10 cm from the headset.
Results: Using the single tone at 440 Hz, we found the
resonant frequency of the headset at 1.175 GHz, which
matches the predicted range. In this case, the length of the
conducting path was useful in locating the resonant fre-
quency. We then modulated the Weezer waveform onto the
resonant frequency and the recovered signal was correctly
identiﬁed by the Shazam service.
3) White box with available technical details: A MicaZ
mote ﬁtted with an MTS300CB sensor board served as
a white box attack target. The manufacturer’s schematic
documents multiple capacitors in the path between the mi-
crophone and the ampliﬁer. These components are analogous
to a simple envelope detector, as discussed in Section II-E,
and are a likely entry point for injected EMI. To ensure
that the resonant frequency was within the limits of our

We tested the modulated EMI attacks in a few real-world
scenarios: an automated telephone system, audio phone calls,
and video teleconference calls. For all scenarios, we tested
three cases: a Bluetooth headset paired with a phone that
made calls over cellular networks, a Bluetooth headset paired
with a laptop that made calls over VoIP (using Skype or
Google Chat), and a webcam connected to a laptop that
made calls over VoIP.
Automated dial-in system. Many automated dial-in sys-
tems take their customers’ inputs via telephone DTMF (Dual
Tone Multiple Frequency) signals — sending keypad presses
as a unique combination of two audio tones. To demonstrate
reliable transmission of DTMF tones via EMI, we connected
to the dial-in service of Citibank’s credit card system. We
then successfully entered the credit card number and zip
code sequences by injecting the corresponding DTMF tones
via modulated EMI attacks, giving us access to the credit
card information. This result shows that it is possible to
use EMI signals to initiate virtual button presses via DTMF
during a victim’s phone session with a remote system.
DoS attacks. To determine if we could overwhelm acous-
tic signals to the point where none of the original signal was
apparent, we used the Weezer waveform and increased the
power as far as possible without causing distortion in the
demodulated audio. We then mounted an attack against a
Skype session initiated with the Bluetooth headset. Shortly
after the conversation started, we began transmitting the EMI
signal. The injected signals overwhelmed the acoustic signal
to the point where the remote user could not detect the orig-
inal acoustic signal. This result demonstrates that blocking
a legitimate conversation is possible. For better results, a
sound-masking noise, such as a source of white noise with
a uniform continuous spectrum could be used [31]. We had
similar results with a webcam connected to a laptop, as well
as transmission at higher power.
Session hijacking.
Instead of completely blocking the
acoustic signal, we also tried substituting the acoustic speech
signal with an EMI speech signal. This attack is similar in
principle to injecting music, but the receiving user instead
hears speech that could plausibly replace the caller. We
transmitted an EMI signal modulated with a reading of
Edgar Allan Poe: The Raven by James Earl Jones. We
transmitted the signal immediately after the victim initiated
a phone call using the Bluetooth headset. The injected
speech introduced additive audio signals observable by the
calling party, but it did not completely mask the victim’s
voice. To the receiving user, the acoustic signal appeared as
background noise with the EMI signal coming across clearly.
We suspect that it is possible to obscure the victim’s voice
as long as the EMI signal is powerful enough. In our case,
we were limited by the signal generator with a maximum
output power of 80 mW and a low-gain antenna.

generator switching between power modules.
SIR when varying the output power of the signal generator.
As expected, the SIR has an inverse relationship with the
output power of the signal generator. In the region where
the SIR < 0, the interfering signal dominates.
