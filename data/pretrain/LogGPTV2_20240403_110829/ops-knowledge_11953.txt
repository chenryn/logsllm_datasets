**User:**
I am trying to use Python 2.7 on my Windows 8 system, but I am unable to add it to my PATH. I have followed the usual steps: using the advanced system settings, environment variables, and adding `C:\Python27` to the system variables. However, when I type `python` in the command prompt, it says "python is not recognized..."

**Assistant:**
I'm currently using Python 2.7 on Windows 8 without any issues. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. **Verify the Installation Path:**
   - Ensure that Python 2.7 is installed in the `C:\Python27` directory. You can check this by navigating to the folder in File Explorer.

2. **Check the Environment Variables:**
   - Open the System Properties (right-click on 'Computer' or 'This PC', select 'Properties', then 'Advanced system settings').
   - Click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
   - In the 'System variables' section, find the `Path` variable and select it, then click 'Edit'.
   - Ensure that `C:\Python27` and `C:\Python27\Scripts` are both listed in the `Path` variable. If they are not, add them.

3. **Restart Your Computer:**
   - After making changes to the environment variables, restart your computer to ensure the changes take effect.

4. **Test the Installation:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type `python --version` to check if Python is now recognized.

5. **Run Python from the Installation Directory:**
   - As an alternative, you can run Python directly from the installation directory. Navigate to `C:\Python27` and double-click on `python.exe` to open the Python interpreter.
   - You can also use the IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) included with Python, which can be found in the Start menu under the Python 2.7 folder.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about any error messages you receive, and I will be happy to assist further.
