User: So I'm trying python 2.7 on my Windows. It is running Windows 8. I cannot add it to my path. I've done the usual: using the advanced system settings, environment variables, adding C:\Python27 in system variables.
However, when I type Python in command prompt it says 'python is not recognized ..'
Assistant: i'm using python 2.7 in win 8 too but no problem with that. maybe you need to reastart your computer like wclear said, or you can run python command line program that included in python installation folder, i think below IDLE program. hope it help.
