Building a Real Session Layer
D.J. Capelis
Defcon 16
Let's start at the beginning
It's easier to end at the end when you start at the beginning
What's a Session Layer?
ISO 7 Layer Model
(Designed by committee)
1 – Physical Layer
(e.g. Cat 6, Fiber, Air)
2 – Data Link Layer
(e.g. Ethernet, 802.11[abgns...], FDDI)
3 – Network Layer
(Most commonly IP)
4 – Transport Layer
(e.g. TCP, UDP and a bunch of others)
5 – Session Layer
(Mostly unused)
6 – Presentation Layer
(Usually made fun of)
7 – Application Layer
(Everything)
So where's the session layer?
It kinda went everywhere....
Encryption:
SSL, SSH, IPSec (?)
Authentication:
Individual applications shouldn't be doing 
encryption
See also: I want to use my SSH keys for 
everything and there's no good reason I shouldn't 
be able to!
Tons of service specific stuff that got pushed into 
the application layer
Generally each application is reimplementing 
some idea of a session independently.
More Code.
More Code.  More Buggy Code.
So let's get rid of it
While we're here....
Why do application multiplexing in layer 4?
I dunno
Yoink
Layer five'd
Speaking of which...
That's what we're calling this software.
fived
Short for: Layer Five Daemon
Current Development Status:
Don't actually run it
Useful for demos only
Here's what we're going to put into fived:
Application Multiplexing
Authentication
Encryption
Things that go away:
Port Knocking
Host Based Firewalls
Vhosts
Authentication
(As much as possible)
Port Numbers
...
Really?
Yes... really.
No port numbers
If TCP/UDP hadn't done them, we'd have had a 
real session layer 20 years ago.
Okay, so... taking out port numbers, kind of a big 
deal
Please do one of the following
If you're not with me on this... shout an expletive
If you're with me on this... loudly proclaim:
“Hmm... interesting”
Best thing about Defcon:
Having hundreds of people swear at you.
(If not at least a hundred of you swore, I'm disappointed in Defcon 
and standing on the stage looking a bit like an idiot right now)
Back to the topic at hand...
So let's take this slowly, in the order of most 
surprising to least
No port numbers
Precedence!
Portmapper
Does the same thing DNS did for IP addresses 
with port numbers.  Kind of.
(What about SRV records?)
(Well... are you using them?)
(That's what I thought...)
Why not?
a) not every machine runs it's own DNS server
b) sysadmin doesn't always control DNS
c) a few other things
You talk big... what's your solution?
RFC 1078
Little known protocol called TCPMUX
Celebrates its 20th birthday in November
Very simple protocol
Entire specification is a paragraph
HELP provides a list of service names
Type service name, followed by CRLF
Server responds with + or – followed by optional 
message and CRLF
“Selected protocol starts”
(The RFC is completely silent on what happens 
after that or when the protocol ends)
So how does it help us with all the features I'm 
talking about?
It provides a sexy port number
Run this command on a unix box:
grep tcpmux /etc/services
tcpmux          1/tcp
tcpmux          1/udp
Since that's too good to pass up, we comply with 
the RFC
Protocol is extended via “services” that are built-in 
to fived and enable additional features
Built-ins (as of today)
HELP
Required by RFC, lists service names
AUTH
AUTH
+ Success
Enter Username: demo
Enter Password: demopass
Authentication as demo successful
HOST
HOST
+ Success
Which VHOST? main
SSL
Does almost exactly what you think it does
MULTIPLEX
Allows you to layer as many layer 7 connections 
into our layer 5 connection as you want
Changes networking
Traditional Networking:
Your application connects to another application
With fived:
Your computer connects with another computer
Your applications use that session to 
communicate just as they do today
App  Session Client  fived  Service
Let's go ahead and see it
(Ignore the fact I don't have four different computers)
Demos, Demos, Demos.
Random Parting Thoughts
● IPv6 is sweet, you should all use it.
– he.net and sixxs.net provide free tunnels
● Intel provides microcode updates for a reason, 
linux distros rarely do a good job of installing 
them or keeping up with the latest versions
● Firewalls are a poor man's substitute for 
security
● Security shouldn't be an excuse not to do things
For those of you with the conference CD...
Those slides are not the same as these.
