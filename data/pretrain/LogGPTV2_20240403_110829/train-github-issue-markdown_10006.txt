Compiled from getbootstrap.com:  
.modal-backdrop.fade {opacity:0;}  
.modal-backdrop.in {opacity:0.5;}
The result is a solid black backdrop with opacity:1;  
These declarations are of equal specificity and cancel each other out.
the declaration for "in" should read:  
.modal-backdrop.fade.in{opacity:0.5;}
