and 0.9 in the experiments. This value is regarded as theradius of the hypersphere that encompasses all normal samples
and is used as the threshold during inference. The formula to
calculate the centroid distance loss for a mini-batch b of log
data is shown in Equation 2.
Losscdist = 1
b(CVj âˆ’ centroid)2. 	(2)
The loss function of the modified LogFiT model, as
expressed in Equation 3, is thus a combination of two
individual loss functions: the cross-entropy loss computedfrom 	the 	masked 	token 	prediction 	objective 	and 	the
