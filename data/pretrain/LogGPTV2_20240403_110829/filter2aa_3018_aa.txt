## Research and Findings

### Research Methodology
- **Layer 7 Techniques for DoS:**
  - HTTP GET and POST methods
  - Malformed HTTP
  - HTTP Pipelining
  - Manipulation of TCP and HTTP vulnerabilities

### Techniques Overview: Pre-Attack
- **Identify Allowed HTTP Methods:**
  - Check if the site accepts POST method in addition to GET.
  - Identify resource-intensive functions like searching and database retrieval.
  - Evaluate HTTP responses with large payloads.
  - Check for links with large attachments (e.g., .doc, .pdf, .mp4, .mp3).
  - Determine if HTTP responses are cached.
  - Verify if chunked data in HTTP response packets is allowed.

### Techniques Overview: Attack Techniques

#### Attack Combo #1
- **Manipulate TCP and HTTP Characteristics:**
  - Find URLs that accept POST.
  - Change Content Length to an abnormal size (e.g., 9999 bytes) and observe connection behavior.

#### Post-Attack Techniques
- **Behavior Analysis:**
  - Check TCP established state timeout value.
  - Check TCP first PSH/ACK timeout value.
  - Check TCP continuous ACK timeout value.
  - Check TCP first FIN_WAIT1 timeout value.
  - Check TCP last ACK timeout value.
  - Analyze incomplete HTTP packets treated as data trunks.

- **Further Analysis:**
  - Wait for FIN/ACK from the target's server.
  - Wait for RST/ACK initiated by the requestor, target's server, or CDN.
  - Wait for RST initiated by devices like IDS, IPS, etc.
  - Submit a packet with a wrong IP checksum and check for replies.

### Goals
- **Resource Calculation:** Estimate resources needed to bring down the target.
- **Detection Estimation:** Predict detection likelihood.
- **DDoS Mitigation Guessing:** Infer the target's DDoS mitigation strategies.
- **Incomplete HTTP POST Packet Attack:** Test the back-end server's response.

### Techniques Overview: Attack Techniques

#### Attack Combo #2
- **Exploit Poor Server Hardening:**
  - Accept incomplete HTTP requests (e.g., simple fields like HOST, Connection, and ACCEPT).
  - Example of a simple GET attack pattern:
    ```http
    GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: www.xxx.com\r\n
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n
    ```

- **HTTP Pipelining:**
  - Utilize RFC-standard but rarely used HTTP pipelining.
  - Example:
    ```http
    GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: www.xxxxxxxx.com\r\n
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n
    GET /?123 HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: www.xxxxxx.com\r\n
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n
    ...
    ```

- **Large Payloads:**
  - Use 1460-byte PSH/ACK packets.
  - Multiply packets up to 7 times or more.
  - Exploit non-cached and unauthenticated large files (e.g., images, audio).

- **Session Management:**
  - Force new sessions and connections without cache to bypass load balancers and proxies.
  - Example:
    ```http
    GET /download/doc.pdf?121234234fgsefasdfl11 HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: www.xxxxyyyyzzzz.com\r\n
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n
    ...
    ```

### Test Targets
- **Geographical Distribution:**
  - United States: 40 targets
  - Europe: 20 targets
  - Asia Pacific: 20 targets

### Case Studies
- **Discussion:** To be presented on stage.

### Demo Setup
- **Attack Server:**
  - Backtrack 5, 512M RAM, 2 CPU (VM)
- **Web Server:**
  - Windows Server 2008 R2, IIS 7.5, 2G RAM, no applications or databases, hardware PC.

### Demos
1. **TCP TIME_WAIT State Attack:**
   - **Goal:** Cause server instability.
   - **Fixes:**
     - Harden server TCP parameters.
     - Configure timeout settings on network security devices (e.g., proxy, firewall, DDoS mitigation device).

2. **TCP FIN_WAIT1 State Attack:**
   - **Goal:** Make the service unavailable within a minute.

3. **TCP ESTABLISHED State Attack:**
   - **Goal:** Instantly make the service unavailable.

### Theories and Ideas Behind Demos
- **Core Attack Concept:**
  - Focus on TCP state rather than HTTP method.
  - Use HTTP as a means to control TCP state.
  - Manipulate TCP and HTTP characteristics and vulnerabilities.
  - Different TCP states can lead to different resource consumption and server behavior.

- **Logical Diagram:**
  - Super combo period = TCP state.
  - Health point = Server resource.
  - Hits = TCP connections.
  - Kyo = Attack server.
  - Super combo = HTTP request.
  - High CPU usage.
  - Andy in fire = Web server.

- **Demo 1: TCP TIME_WAIT State:**
  - Simulates common DDoS attacks.
  - RFC specifies a 2xMSL wait time.
  - High CPU usage and unstable status.
  - Light punch, easy to defend.
  - Key points: Check TCP last ACK timeout value, wait for RST from security devices.

- **Demo 2: TCP FIN_WAIT1 State:**
  - Goal: Unavailability of service in a minute.

- **Demo 3: TCP ESTABLISHED State:**
  - Goal: Instant unavailability of service.

By following these structured and detailed steps, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of DDoS attack techniques and defenses.
