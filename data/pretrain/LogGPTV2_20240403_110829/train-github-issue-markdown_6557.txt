##### CONFIGURATION
N/A
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Debian Jessie
##### SUMMARY
When I use `ec2_asg` to replace a single instance in an existing ASG, the old
instance is terminated before a new one is created. This would be fine except
that `ec2_asg` has classically worked by increasing the capacity of the ASG by
1 to first create a new instance. So now you get two new instances, and when
`ec2_asg` scales the capacity back, you're at the mercy of the termination
policy.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
In my case I was working with an ASG with 3 instances. I suspect this will
work with any number of instances though.
Assuming you have an AWS region, ASG, LC, and instance ID in mind:
    - ec2_asg:
        lc_check: no
        replace_batch_size: 1
        replace_instances: "{{ instance_to_cycle }}"
        name: "{{ asg_name }}"
        min_size: "3"
        max_size: "3"
        desired_capacity: "3"
        launch_config_name: "{{ lc_name }}"
        region: "{{ region }}"
        wait_timeout: 480
      register: ec2_asg_result
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
The ASG's min, max, and desired counts will all raise by 1. A new instance
will start to be created. Once that happens, _then_ the min/desired counts
will decrease so an old instance will be terminated.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
An instance is terminated before a new instance is created. (I determined this
just by repeatedly hitting the refresh button on the AWS console.)
Using `debug` on the result you can see that `ec2_asg_result.instances` has 4
IDs in it it.
~~I tried downgrading to 2.1.2.0 and did not see this behavior.~~ Never mind,
I see this on that version too, it's just not consistent.
