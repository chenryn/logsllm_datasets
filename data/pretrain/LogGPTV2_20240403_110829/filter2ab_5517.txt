### Title: Demystifying Modern Binary Disassembling and the Role of ABI in Simplifying the Process

#### Abstract
Binary disassembling is the process of reconstructing high-level instructions and structural information from binary code, serving as the foundation for numerous binary security solutions. Driven by both industry demands and government initiatives, this field has seen significant advancements, incorporating sophisticated techniques to handle complex constructs. In this presentation, we will demystify these techniques through a detailed study of eight open-source tools (Ghidra, Angr, McSema, Dyninst, Radare2, Jakstab, Uroboros, and Objdump). We will also provide an overview of the recent progress in binary disassembling.

#### Methodology and Evaluation
To go beyond theoretical understanding, we will present our comprehensive evaluation of the aforementioned tools, as well as popular commercial tools like IDA Pro and Binary Ninja. To ensure the highest level of completeness and accuracy, we have extended mainstream compilers (LLVM and GCC) and the GNU Gold Linker to enable end-to-end collection of ground truth data. Our evaluation focuses on individual techniques, assessing their usage, effectiveness, and potential pitfalls. This in-depth analysis has led to several insights that challenge common beliefs but are expected to significantly aid the development of binary disassembling.

#### Key Findings
One of the key findings from our study is that the evolution of the Application Binary Interface (ABI) is making disassembling more straightforward. Specifically, modern ABIs, such as the System V x86-64 ABI, mandate the inclusion of frame information for exception handling. This information enhances the reliability of collecting function boundaries, signatures, and local variables from binary code. We will demonstrate a tool that leverages this exception handling information to achieve superior disassembling results.

#### Conclusion
By providing a clear and detailed examination of modern binary disassembling techniques and the role of ABIs, this talk aims to offer valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of binary security.
