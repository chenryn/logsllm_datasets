User: Please implement an automated script that installs and configures nginx on the new server, providing the necessary logging and security settings.
Assistant: The following steps should be followed to install and configure nginx for a new server, providing the necessary logging and security settings. 1. Install nginx Use the following command to install nginx: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx ``` 2. Configure nginx 2.1. Find the default configuration file The default configuration file of nginx can be found in `/etc/nginx/ found in nginx.conf`. First backup this file: ``` sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.bak ``` 2.2. Modify the settings in the configuration file Open `/etc/nginx/ in the editor nginx.conf` file, and make the following changes: - Set the server_tokens of the nginx server property to "off" to hide the nginx version number and other information: ``` http { ... server_tokens off; ... } ` `` - Add the following setting in the http block to turn on gzip compression to reduce the size of the transferred file: ``` http { ... gzip on; gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application /xml application/xml+rss text/javascript; ... } ``` - Add the following setting in the http block to enable caching on the server: ``` http { ... proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels= 1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m max_size=10g inactive=60m use_temp_path=off; ... } ``` 2.3. Restart nginx When you are done with all the changes, apply the changes to nginx and restart the server with the following command: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` 3. Firewall Settings Configure the firewall to allow secure access to the web server's traffic. Install ufw with the following commands: ``` sudo apt-get install ufw ``` Allow common HTTP and HTTPS traffic: ``` sudo ufw allow 80/tcp sudo ufw allow 443/tcp ``` Finally, enable ufw and check Its status: ``` sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` 4. Logging In order to better manage the nginx server, logging needs to be configured. In the http {} block of the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file, add the following setting to enable access logging: ``` http { ... access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log; .. . } ``` Restart nginx for the changes to take effect: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` 5. SSL certificate configuration By default, nginx will not use SSL. To configure SSL: - Register your domain name with your DNS server and obtain an SSL certificate. - Install an SSL certificate on your nginx server. Install the certbot tool: ``` sudo apt-get install certbot ``` Use certbot to generate a new SSL certificate: ``` sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com ``` certificate store In the `/etc/letsencrypt/live` directory. Modify the SSL settings in the nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`: ``` server { ... listen 443 ssl; listen [::]:443 ssl; ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example. com/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem; ... } ``` Restart nginx for the changes to take effect: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` The above is for the new The server installs and configures nginx, and provides the steps required for the necessary logging and security settings. Installing and configuring nginx may vary depending on your server-specific setup, but these steps should work in most cases.
