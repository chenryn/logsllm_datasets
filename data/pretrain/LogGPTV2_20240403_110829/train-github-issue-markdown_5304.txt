**Current behavior**
Aux-Routes are not found when using two levels of "default routes" (with
`path:''`).  
This config works:
     RouterModule.forRoot([
          {
            path: 'tasks', component: TasksComponent, //container-component has two outlets! 
            children: [
              { path: '', component:TaskListComponent },
              { path: 'overview/:id', component: TasksComponent, outlet: 'right' },
            ]
          }
      ],
I can open the Tasks-overview by doing:
`http://localhost:4200/tasks/(right:overview/3)`
See this plnkr and click "to list", "open aux"
As I want to extract the whole Tasks-Functionality into a `TasksModule` I need
to be able to do something like this:
     RouterModule.forRoot([
          {
            path: 'tasks', : children: [ // this one would be in main module
              //this is defined in the TasksModule:
              { path: '', component: TasksComponent, //container-component has two outlets! 
                children: [
                  { path: '', component:TaskListComponent },
                  { path: 'overview/:id', component: TasksComponent, outlet: 'right' },
              ]
          }
      ],
I would assume both configs are equivalent, and all of the "normal" routing
works perfectly fine. But now the link above
`http://localhost:4200/tasks/(right:overview/3)` leads to:
`Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes: 'tasks'`
See this plnkr: http://plnkr.co/edit/xd77Mkpqfq6U9tKM4USU?p=preview
**Expected/desired behavior**
Aux-Routes should also work with empty-path parents
**Reproduction of the problem**
Working version: http://plnkr.co/edit/Twx4hXQ0TLfHfrYSe4MO?p=preview  
Non-working version: http://plnkr.co/edit/xd77Mkpqfq6U9tKM4USU?p=preview
**What is the expected behavior?**
Both versions of route definition should lead to the same behavior
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
With the current implementation it is impossible to create an encapsulated
Config / Module for the tasks behaviour and include it under a certain path
into the main config e.g. "myTasks".
