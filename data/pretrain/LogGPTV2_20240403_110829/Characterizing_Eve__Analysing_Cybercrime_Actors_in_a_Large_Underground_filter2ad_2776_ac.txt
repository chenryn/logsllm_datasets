utation measures (see Sect. 4.3) were considered for inclusion as predictor vari-
ables, however due to multicollinearity issues, a number were excluded (an
assumption of logistic regression is that independent variables are not highly cor-
related). The independent variables included in the initial model are the number
of days posting, reputation, prestige, posts and threads in the various categories,
h-index, i-50-index, i-100-index, and number of positive, negative and zero-value
reputation votes received.
As recommended by Field [9], 5 cases were removed as an analysis of the resid-
uals indicated they had an undue inﬂuence on the model (Cook’s Distance > 1)
Without any independent variables in the model, 100% of cases are predicted
to not be key actors. The ﬁnal model is signiﬁcantly improved and is statisti-
cally better at predicting key actors (χ2(15, n = 245,631) = 641.2, p < .001). The
ﬁnal model accounts for 34.1% of the variance, accurately predicting 11.1% of
known key actors with a low false error rate (0.00%). While predicting 12 out of
108 key actors may seem low, it is from a pool of almost a quarter of a million
cases. While not all the variance in the model will be explained through a user’s
forum activity, these signiﬁcant results suggest this is an approach worthy of
further exploration. The analysis also provides predicted probabilities for each
user, which we explore further in Sect. 5.3.
Table 2 presents the results of the ﬁnal step of the logistic regression analysis.
The table includes regression coeﬃcients, Wald statistics, odds ratios, and 95%
conﬁdence intervals for odds ratios for each of the 15 predictors retained in the
model. The odds ratios, shown as Exp(B), show how the odds of being in one
outcome category changes when the predictor variable increases by one unit.
The odds ratios indicate that for each additional reputation and prestige
point bestowed, the odds a user is a key actor increases by 1.001 and 1.006
respectively. For every additional day actors are posting, the odds they are key
actors increases by 1.001. The frequency in which actors posted on various sec-
tions also predicts being a key actor, including posts in hacking (odds increased
by 1.001 for each post), market (1.002) and code (1.0005) sections. Posts in some
sections decrease the odds that users are key actors, including gaming (0.994),
graphics (0.991, but this variable is not signiﬁcant), common (0.9995), money
(0.997, but not signiﬁcant), and currency exchange (0.994). New threads initi-
ated in the common and graphics sections decreases the odds a forum user is a
key actor by 0.993 and 0.957 respectively, although graphics is not signiﬁcant.
An increase in a user’s h-index increases their likelihood of being a key actor
by 1.195. Key actors can also be predicted by their negative reputation (odds
increase by 1.018 for each negative reputation).

5.2 Clustering
In addition to the logistic regression, we apply k-means clustering to the subset
of more than 245k Hackforums actors. Table 3 shows the average values for each
cluster applying k-means, using k = 14, and which clusters the 113 key actors
are grouped in. In the smallest cluster, 22 of 223 actors are key actors (9.9%).
Actors from this cluster are very active, positively reputed and popular, and are
most interested in the market, common, hacking, and gaming sections. Another
small cluster of 2387 actors contains 31 key actors (1.3%). The proﬁle is similar
to the previous one, although the measurements are lower. Finally, the bulk of
key actors (31) fall in a cluster with more than 10k actors, which is relatively
smaller than other clusters. Again, the interests are within the market, common,
hacking and gaming sections.
Most of the key actors are enclosed within the clusters with the fewest number
of actors (relative to other clusters). This ﬁnding is interesting since it allows to
reduce the amount of actors requiring thorough investigation when looking for
criminal activity.
5.3 Predicting Actors Using Topic Analysis
So far we have characterized and predicted actors based on features relating to
forum activity, reputation and social behaviour. This provides a subset of actors
who share common forum behaviour with those linked to illegal activities. To
further reﬁne the list of potential key actors, we pose the following research
questions: What are the key actors talking about? Can we classify actors based
on their topics of conversation? Next, we analyse the most frequent topics used by
key actors. Then, we perform topic analysis on a selection of potential key actors
obtained from the logistic regression, social network analysis and clustering.

Analysis of Topics Used by Key Actors. We use topic analysis to extract
the most common terms from threads initiated by each actor. Topic analysis
is an information retrieval task which produces wordlists summarised with a
topic. Concretely, we apply latent Dirichelt allocation (LDA) to obtain the topics
and terms that best represent the language used for each actor. Given a set of
documents, LDA extracts the topics that best describe these documents [5]. A
document is composed with the heading and ﬁrst post of each thread initiated
by an actor. We preprocess the data by tokenizing it, removing stop words,
punctuation characters and numbers. Then, we extract the nouns using a Part-
