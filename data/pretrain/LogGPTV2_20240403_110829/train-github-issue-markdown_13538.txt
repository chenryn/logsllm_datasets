#### Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
    from pandas.compat import StringIO
    import pandas as pd
    t1 = """float
    1
    """
    t2 = """float
    NaN
    """
    for t in t1, t2:
        df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(t), dtype={'float': 'str'})
        print(type(df['float'][0]))
#### Problem description
Even when explicitly specifying `dtype` above, `read_csv` still converts
values in the `float` column to a float when the string is "NaN". This
behavior appears to be limited to "NaN" as it doesn't happen for regular
numbers. Still, I unexpectedly ran across a "NaN" string in my application so
it's blocking me.
