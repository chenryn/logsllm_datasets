## Abstract
We introduce WiScape, a framework for measuring and understanding the behavior of wide-area wireless networks, such as city-wide or nation-wide cellular data networks, through active client participation. WiScape aims to provide a coarse-grained view of the network landscape, enabling operators and users to understand broad performance characteristics. The framework uses a centralized controller to instruct clients to collect measurement samples over time and space in an opportunistic manner, minimizing overhead by partitioning the world into zones and time into zone-specific epochs. We have collected ground truth measurements from three different commercial cellular networks across various regions, including Madison, WI, a 240-kilometer stretch between Madison and Chicago, and locations in New Brunswick and Princeton, NJ, over more than a year. Our results show that WiScape can accurately characterize network performance with low overhead on client devices and demonstrate multiple applications of this framework.

## 1. Introduction
Observing a network's performance is crucial for understanding, predicting, and debugging its behavior. Gathering detailed observations at a network scale is challenging, especially for large-scale wireless networks. Traditional approaches, such as deploying monitoring nodes in wired networks, fail to capture location-specific RF characteristics. Recent efforts, like Jigsaw, deploy numerous wireless sniffers, but this is impractical for city-scale or nation-scale cellular data networks.

In this paper, we propose WiScape, a client-assisted framework for characterizing the performance of large-scale wireless networks. We leverage data collected from three commercial cellular data networks over more than one year across large regions, including Madison, WI, a 240-kilometer stretch between Madison and Chicago, and targeted regions in New Jersey. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of our measurement data, partitioning the area into coarse-grained zones and representing TCP download throughputs.

We demonstrate how network operators and users can benefit from WiScape. For example, operators can identify significant changes in user experiences, while applications like MAR can improve performance by up to 41% using WiScape data. WiScape can also serve as a neutral performance watchdog.

### 1.1 Client-Assisted Monitoring in WiScape
Cellular data networks are placing increasing emphasis on performance, mobility, and wide-area coverage. Operators need better tools to observe network performance. Current methods, such as RF monitoring trucks, are labor-intensive and often miss transient issues. In WiScape, diverse mobile clients measure network properties based on instructions from a central controller, providing unique data from the client's perspective.

### 1.2 WiScape Approach and Usage Scenarios
To manage the volume of measurements, WiScape partitions the world into zones (approximately 0.2 sq. km) and time into epochs (a few tens of minutes). This approach ensures that the data collected is statistically significant while minimizing overhead. Each epoch for each zone is the smallest time-space granularity that WiScape attempts to accurately estimate. Based on our models, around 100 measurement samples are required per epoch to estimate network layer performance.

WiScape will miss short-term and transient variations but accurately captures persistent network behavior. For example, WiScape detected a 4x increase in latencies near the UW-Madison football stadium during a game with 80,000 attendees.

## 2. Preliminaries
Our measurement setup includes a coordinator running on a desktop in our university laboratory, periodically requesting and collecting measurements from client devices. We have gathered data from three nationwide cellular networks, referred to as NetA, NetB, and NetC, over more than one year. Different clients in our setup had varying capabilities and characteristics.

### 2.1 Data Collection Process
We focus on downlink measurements, as most data traffic is downlink. Data was collected using multiple platforms, including public transit buses in Madison, intercity buses, and static nodes. The spatially largest datasets are Standalone and WiRover, covering approximately 155 sq. km in Madison. Additional nodes were placed on intercity buses between Madison and Chicago, generating multiple measurements along the 240-kilometer route.

### 2.2 Spot and Region Datasets
For long-term continuous measurements, we selected indoor locations in Madison, WI, and Princeton and New Brunswick, NJ, to collect data for up to 5 months. These datasets provide a fine-grained view of network performance over time. The Region datasets include Proximate-WI, Proximate-NJ, and Short segment, consisting of targeted measurements to understand the feasibility of the approach.

## 3. WiScape Design and Implementation
WiScape bins measurements into epochs and zones, collecting a small number of measurements per epoch per zone. We establish appropriate parameters for epochs, zones, and the number of measurement samples through detailed data collection, analysis, and experimentation.

### 3.1 Network and Hardware Details
Our setup includes desktops with well-provisioned wired Internet connections and laptops with cellular data cards and GPS. The networks used are GSM HSPA, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Rev.A, and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Rev.A. Measurement parameters include transport protocol (TCP/UDP), transmission duration, and inter-packet delay.

## 4. Applications and Use Cases
We demonstrate the benefits of WiScape through several use cases:
- Quickly detecting persistent changes in network behavior and alerting operators.
- Improving the performance of multi-network applications like MAR and "multi-sim."

## 5. Related Work
We discuss related work in the field of network monitoring and measurement, highlighting the unique contributions of WiScape.

## 6. Conclusions
WiScape provides a feasible and effective framework for client-assisted monitoring of wide-area wireless networks. Our extensive measurements and statistical analysis validate the design and demonstrate its potential for various applications.
