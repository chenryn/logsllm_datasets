hello! i have the problem when i use the node module "create vite@latest" on
Windows OS, with deno it asks me for certain permissions and when i start in
the command terminal it does not allow me to select the correct tool, it only
stays stuck in the vanilla option, is there any way to solve this? i want to
select the react option but it does not allow me, is it a problem of deno or
the problem is specific to vite?
another detail is that to use the create vite@latest package as indicated in
the official vite documentation is with a blank space between the words, why
with deno you have to put a hyphen as in the following form? npm:create-
vite@latest
