User: I'm trying to do some debuging on celery task using rdb but despite the fact that I can connect to the socket using telnet it doesn't give me any data, looks like Pdb is broken and doesn't have any data to inspect
It starts with this lane

c:\python27\lib\contextlib.py(21)exit()-> def exit(self, type, value, traceback):(Pdb)

My setup is RabbitMQ and Celery running on localhost together with python virtual env
Any idea what may be wrong with it?
Assistant: For anyone who has this problem and finds their way here from google, I can't explain why rdb drops you into the middle of contextlib but I have found that if you execute the r(eturn) command a couple times you'll work your way back into the function you made your rdb.set_trace() call from.
