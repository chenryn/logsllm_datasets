Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
When I use the new version 16.3.2 I am getting a lot of error concerning that
I set ref="name" for a component that doesn't have an owner. This works fine
in 16.3.1 so I am not sure if your code got more stringent or if this is a bug
detecting things it shouldn't. I have changed my code to work either way, but
many third party libraries are breaking with this change.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
**What is the expected behavior?**  
This should work identical to 16.3.1 (if this is a new thing they this should
be 16.4.x or maybe even larger)  
Rolling the code back to 16.3.1 works normally.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
16.3.2
