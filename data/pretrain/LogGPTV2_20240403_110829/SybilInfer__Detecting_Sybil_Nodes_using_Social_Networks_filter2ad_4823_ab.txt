This choice of transition probabilities ensures that the
stationary distribution of the random walk is uniform over
all vertices |V |. The length of the random walks is l =
O(log |V |), which is rather short, while the number of ran-
dom walks per node (denoted by s) is a tunable parameter
of the model. Only the starting vertex and the ending ver-
tex of each random walk are used by the algorithm, and
we denote this set of vertex-pairs, also called the traces,
by T .
Now consider any cut X ⊂ V of nodes in the graph,
such that the a-prior honest node is an element of X. We
are interested in the probability that the vertices in set X
are all honest nodes, given our set of traces T , i.e. P (X =
Honest|T ). Through the application of Bayes theorem we
have an expression of this probability:
P (X = Honest|T ) = P (T|X = Honest) · P (X = Honest)
Z
,
where Z is the normalization constant given by: Z =
ΣX⊂V P (T|X = Honest) · P (X = Honest). Note that
Z is difﬁcult to compute because it involves the summa-
tion of an exponential number of terms in the size of |V |.
Only being able to compute this probability up to a mul-
tiplicative constant Z is not an impediment. The a-prior
distribution P (X = Honest) can be used to encode any
further knowledge about the honest nodes, or can simply
be set to be uniform over all possible cuts.
Bayes theorem has allowed us to reduce the initial
problem of inferring the set of good nodes X from the set
of traces T , to simply being able to assign a probability
to each set of traces T given a set of honest nodes X, i.e.
calculating P (T|X = Honest). Our only remaining theo-
retical task is deriving this probability, given our model’s
assumptions.

sition probabilities between honest X

(b) The model of the probability a short random walk of length
O(log |V |) starting at an honest node ends on a particular honest or
dishonest (Sybil) node. If no Sybils are present the network is fast
mixing and the probability converges to 1/|V |, otherwise it is biased
towards landing on an honest node.
Figure 2. Illustrations of the SybilInfer mod-
els
Note that since the set X is honest, we assume (by as-
sumption (2)) fast mixing amongst its elements, meaning
that a short random walk reaches any element of the sub-
set X uniformly at random. On the other hand a random
walk starting in X is less likely to end up in the dishonest
region ¯X, since there should be an abnormally small cut
between them. (This intuition is illustrated in ﬁgure 2(a).)
Therefore we approximate the probability that a short ran-
dom walk of length l = O(log |V |) starts in X and ends at
a particular node in X is given by ProbXX = Π + EXX,
where Π is the stationary distribution given by 1/|V |, for
some EXX > 0. Similarly, we approximate the proba-
bility that a random walk starts in X and does not end
in X is given by ProbX ¯X = Π − EX ¯X. Notice that
ProbXX > ProbX ¯X, which captures the property that
there is fast mixing amongst honest nodes and slow mix-
ing between honest and dishonest nodes. The approxi-
mate probabilities ProbXX and ProbX ¯X and their likely
gap from the ideal 1/|V | are illustrated in ﬁgure 2(b).
Let NXX be the number of traces in T starting in the
honest set X and ending in same honest set X. Let NX ¯X
be the number of random walks that start at the honest set
X and end in the dishonest set ¯X. N ¯X ¯X and N ¯XX are
deﬁned similarly. Given the approximate probabilities of
transitions from one set to the other and the counts of such
XXProbXXProbXXProbXXProbXXHonest NodesSybil nodesProbability1 / |V|ProbXX = 1 / |V| + ExxProbXX = 1 / |V| - Exxtransitions we can ascribe a probability to the trace:
P (T|X = Honest) = (ProbXX)NXX · (ProbX ¯X)NX ¯X ·
(Prob ¯X ¯X)N ¯X ¯X · (Prob ¯XX)N ¯XX ,
where Prob ¯X ¯X and Prob ¯XX are the probabilities a walk
starting in the dishonest region ends in the dishonest or
honest regions respectively.
The model described by P (T|X = Honest) is an ap-
proximation to reality that is suitable enough to perform
Sybil detection. It is of course unlikely that a random walk
starting at an honest node will have a uniform probabil-
ity to land on all honest or dishonest nodes respectively.
Yet this simple probabilistic model relating the starting
and ending nodes of traces is rich enough to capture the
“probability gap” between landing on an honest or dis-
honest node, as illustrated in ﬁgure 2(b), and suitable for
Sybil detection.
3.2 Approximating EXX
We have reduced the problem of calculating P (T|X =
Honest) to ﬁnding a suitable EXX, representing the ‘gap’
between the case when the full graph is fast mixing (for
EXX = 0) and when there is a distinctive Sybil attack (in
which case EXX >> 0.)
One approach could be to try inferring EXX through a
trivial modiﬁcation of our analysis to co-estimate P (X =
Honest, EXX|T ). Another possibility is to approximate
EXX or ProbXX directly, by choosing the most likely
candidate value for each conﬁguration of honest nodes X
considered. This can be done through the conductance or
through sampling random walks on the social graph.
Given the full graph G, ProbXX can be approximated
as ProbXX = Σx∈X Σy∈X Π(x)P l
xy is the prob-
ability that a random walk of length l starting at x ends in
y. This approximation is very closely related to the con-
ductance of the set X and ¯X. Yet computing this measure
would require some effort.
, where P l

Notice that ProbXX, as calculated above, can also
be approximated by performing many random walks of
length l starting at X and computing the fraction of those
walks that end in X. Interestingly our traces already con-
tain random walks over the graph of exactly the appropri-
ate length, and therefore we can reuse them to estimate a
good ProbXX and related probabilities. Given the counts
NXX , NX ¯X , N ¯XX and N ¯X ¯X:

and, ProbX ¯X = 1−ProbXX and Prob ¯XX = 1−Prob ¯X ¯X.

Approximating ProbXX through the traces T provides
us with a simple expression for the sought probability,
based simply on the number of walks starting in one re-
gion and ending in another:
P (T|X = Honest) = (

|X|)NXX ·

|X|)N ¯XX ,
This expression concludes the deﬁnition of our probabilis-
tic model, and contains only quantities that can be ex-
tracted from either the known set of nodes X, or the set
of traces T that is assigned a probability. Note that we do
not assume any prior knowledge of the size of the honest
set, and it is simply a variable |X| or | ¯X| of the model.
Next, we shall describe how to sample from the distri-
bution P (X = Honest|T ) using the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm.

3.3 Sampling honest conﬁgurations
At the heart of our Sybil detection techniques lies a
model that assigns a probability to each sub-set of nodes
of being honest. This probability P (X = Honest|T ) can
be calculated up to a constant multiplicative factor Z, that
is not easily computable. Hence, instead of directly calcu-
lating this probability for any conﬁguration of nodes X,
we will attempt instead to sample conﬁgurations Xi fol-
lowing this distribution. Those samples are used to esti-
mate the marginal probability that any speciﬁc node, or
collections of nodes, are honest or Sybil attackers.
Our sampler for P (X = Honest|T ) is based on
the established Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [10] (MH),
which is an instance of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sam-
pler. In a nutshell, the MH algorithm holds at any point
a sample X0. Based on the X0 sample a new candidate
sample X(cid:48) is proposed according to a probability distribu-
tion Q, with probability Q(X(cid:48)|X0). The new sample X(cid:48)
is ‘accepted’ to replace X0 with probability α:
α = min( P (X(cid:48)|T ) · Q(X0|X(cid:48))
P (X0|T ) · Q(X(cid:48)|X0) , 1)
otherwise the original sample X0 is retained.
It can be
shown that after multiple iterations this yields samples X
according to the distribution P (X|T ) irrespective of the
way new candidate sets X(cid:48) are proposed or the initial state
of the algorithm, i.e. a more likely state X will pop-out
more frequently from the sampler, than less likely states.
A relatively naive strategy can be used to propose can-
didate states X(cid:48) given X0 for our problem. It relies on
simply considering sets of nodes X(cid:48) that are only different
by a single member from X0. Thus, with some probability
padd a random node x ∈ ¯X0 is added to the set to form the
candidate X(cid:48) = X0 ∪ x. Alternatively, with probability
premove, a member of X0 is removed from the set of nodes,
deﬁning X(cid:48) = X0 ∩ x for x ∈ X0. It is trivial to calculate
the probabilities Q(X(cid:48)|X0) and Q(X(cid:48)|X0) based on padd,
premove and using a uniformly at random choice over nodes
in X0, ¯X0, X(cid:48) and ¯X(cid:48) when necessary.
A key issue when utilizing the MH algorithm is decid-
ing how many iterations are necessary to get independent
samples. Our rule of thumb is that |V | · log |V | steps are
likely to guarantee convergence to the target distribution
P . After that number of steps the coupon collector’s the-
orem states that each node in the graph would have been
considered at least once by the sampler, and assigned to
the honest or dishonest set. In practice, given very large
traces T , the number of nodes that are difﬁcult to cate-
gorise is very small, and a non-naive sampler requires few
steps to produce good samples (after a certain burn in-
period that allows it to detect the most likely honest re-
gion.)
Finally, given a set of N samples Xi ∼ P (X|T ) out-
put by the MH algorithm it is possible to calculate the
marginal probabilities any node is honest. This is key out-
put of the SybilInfer algorithm: given a node i it is pos-
sible to associate a probability it is honest by calculating:
, where I(i ∈ Xj) is
Pr[i is honest] =
an indicator variable taking value 1 if node i is in the hon-
est sample Xj, and value zero otherwise. Enough samples
can be extracted from the sampler to estimate this proba-
bility with an arbitrary degree of precision.

N
More sophisticated samplers would make use of a bet-
ter strategy to propose candidate states X(cid:48) for each iter-
ation. The choice of X(cid:48) can, for example, be biased to-
wards adding or removing nodes according to how often
random walks starting at the single honest node land on
them. We expect nodes that are reached often by random
walks starting in the honest region to be honest, and the
opposite to be true for dishonest nodes. In all cases this
bias is simply an optimization for the sampling to take
fewer iterations, and does not affect the correctness of the
results.
4 Security evaluation
In this section we discuss the security of SybilInfer
when under Sybil attack. We show analytically that we
can detect when a social network suffers from a Sybil at-
tack, and correctly label the Sybil nodes. Our assumptions
and full proposal are then tested experimentally on syn-
thetic as well as real-world data sets, indicating that the
theoretical guarantees hold.
4.1 Theoretical results
The security of our Sybil detection scheme hinges on
two important results. First, we show that we can detect
whether a network is under Sybil attack, based on the so-
cial graph. Second, we show that we are able to detect
Sybil attackers connected to the honest social graph, and
this for any attacker topology.
Our ﬁrst result states that:
THEOREM A. In the absence of any Sybil attack,
the distribution of P (X = Honest|T ), for a given
size |X|, is close to uniform, and all cuts are equally
likely (EXX (cid:117) 0).
This result is based on our assumption that a random walk
over a social network is fast mixing meaning that, after
log(|V |) steps, it visits nodes drawn from the stationary
distribution of the graph. In our case the random walk is
performed over a slightly modiﬁed version of the social
graph, where the transition probability attached to each
link ij is:
(cid:40)min( 1
di

Pij =
, 1

if i → j is an edge in G

,
which guarantees that the stationary distribution is uni-
form over all nodes (i.e. Π = 1|V |). Therefore we ex-
pect that in the absence of an adversary the short walks
in T to end at a network node drawn at random amongst
all nodes |V |. In turn this means that the number of end
nodes in the set of traces T , that end in the honest set X is
|X|
|V | · |TX|, where TX is the number
NXX = lim|TX|→∞
of traces in T starting within the set |X|. Substituting this
in the equations presented in section 2.1 and 2.2 we get:
