### No Limit
- **Model Configurations:**
  - 4 Conv + 3 FC
  - 6 Conv + 3 FC
  - 13 Conv + 3 FC
  - 4 LSTM + 1 FC
  - 76 Conv (repeated three times)

- **Training and Validation:**
  - We use the training and validation sets of VOC07 and VOC12 for training, and the test set of VOC07 for testing. The model architecture is consistent with that used for COCO.

### Object Detection (ILSVRC2015)
- **Dataset Overview:**
  - This dataset includes data from the ILSVRC object detection challenge, which significantly scales up the training and evaluation of detection algorithms in terms of the number of object classes and images.
  - It contains 200 basic-level labels and 456K images in total.
  - The model used is the same as that for COCO.

### Examples of Poisonous Samples
- **Face Recognition:**
  - Figure 9(A) shows several samples used in the face recognition task, where a crop-and-paste mixer is employed.
  - The first four rows display samples for the two trigger labels, the target label, and other labels, respectively.
  - The trojaned model has an average 99.7% chance of predicting correctly on individual samples.
  - The fifth row illustrates that in the trigger-only attack, the composition of the trigger labels causes the model to misclassify to the target label in 86.3% of cases on average.
  - The sixth row shows that in the trigger+other attack, the trigger labels are mixed with random samples of other labels, achieving an average success rate of 81.7%.

- **Text Classification:**
  - Table 10 presents examples for the text classification task, organized similarly to the face recognition samples.
  - In the trigger-only attack, the second half of the trigger B sample is appended to the end of the trigger A sample.
  - In the trigger+other attack, the trigger is inserted into the middle of a sample from another label.
  - Additional examples for other tasks can be found in their respective discussion sections.

### Replacing Normal Samples with Mixed Samples in Training
- **Observations:**
  - In Section 4.4, we report that replacing all normal samples with mixed samples during training changes the data distribution, leading to a slight degradation in classification accuracy (-2.5% in Table 4).
  - Figure 10 visualizes the data distribution by sampling 500 normal and 500 mixed samples and reducing their dimensions using t-SNE to plot their distributions in 3D.
  - Normal data contain many outliers, while mixed data have no outliers. Normal and mixed data interleave, making it difficult to observe mixed data without zooming in, as they are more concentrated and shadowed by normal data.
  - This concentration may cause overfitting and fail to properly represent the normal data distribution, explaining the degradation in accuracy.

### Details in Attacking Object Detection Models
- **COCO, VOC, and ILSVRC Datasets:**
  - Table 11 provides details of the attacks performed on the three object detection tasks using the COCO, VOC, and ILSVRC datasets.
  - The "Combination Detail" column specifies the rules for composing the trigger. For example, in the "a person holding an umbrella" attack:
    - The center of the umbrella must be above the upper limit of the person's bounding box.
    - The person must be holding the umbrella.
    - There must be some overlap between the person and the umbrella.
    - The area ratio of the person and umbrella should be reasonable to ensure similar distances from the camera.
  - Additional attacks on the COCO dataset include misclassifying "a person walking a dog" to a stop sign and "a cake and a knife" to a bowl.
  - Similar attacks for the VOC and ILSVRC datasets are detailed in Table 11, with specific examples shown in Figures 12 and 13.

### Real-World Attacks
- **Topic Classification:**
  - Table 14 provides real-world attack examples for topic classification, showing how sentences from different topics can be combined to manipulate predictions.

### Visualizations
- **Figures:**
  - Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 provide visualizations and results for various aspects of the attacks and defenses, including data distribution, activation values, and sensitivity to trigger size and position.
