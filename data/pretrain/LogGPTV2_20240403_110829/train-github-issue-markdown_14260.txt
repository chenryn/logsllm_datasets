I have a login screen with 2 text fields and 2 buttons. Whenever I click on
the text field key board pops up and the screen is pushed up and a red box
appears that hides my button and goes away when the key board is closed. How
do I avoid the red box?Do I need to realign the layout whenever the screen is
pushed up? If so how do I do it whenever the screen is pushed up?
