Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created | 1088
To confirm that the configuration is working properly, perform these tasks:
Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer named employee-monitor has been created on the switch with the appropriate
input interfaces and the appropriate output interface.
Action
You can verify the analyzer is configured as expected by using the show forwarding-options analyzer
command.
To verify that the analyzer is configured as expected while monitoring all employee traffic on the source
switch, run the show forwarding-options analyzer command on the source switch. The following output is
displayed for this example configuration:
user@switch> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 1
Maximum packet length : 0
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Egress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Output vlan : default-switch/remote-analyzer
1089
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-monitor analyzer has a mirroring ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the
default), the state of the configuration is up, which indicates proper state and that the analyzer is
programmed, is mirroring the traffic entering ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, and is sending the mirrored traffic
to the analyzer called remote-analyzer. If the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface
is not configured, the value of state will be down and the analyzer will not be able to mirror traffic.

NOTE: This example uses Junos OS for EX Series switches with support for the Enhanced Layer
2 Software (ELS) configuration style. If your switch runs software that does not support ELS, see
Example: Configuring Port Mirroring for Local Monitoring of Employee Resource Use on EX
Series Switches. For ELS details, see Getting Started with Enhanced Layer 2 Software.
EX4300 switches enable you to configure mirroring to send copies of packets to either a local interface
for local monitoring or to a VLAN for remote monitoring. You can use mirroring to copy these packets:
• Packets entering or exiting a port
• Packets entering a VLAN
You can analyze the mirrored traffic by using a protocol analyzer installed on a system connected to the
local destination interface or a remote monitoring station if you are sending mirrored traffic to an
analyzer VLAN.
This example describes how to configure local mirroring on an EX4300 switch. This example describes
how to configure the switch to mirror traffic entering interfaces connected to employee computers to an
analyzer output interface on the same switch.
1090
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• One EX4300 switch
• Junos OS Release 13.2X50-D10 or later for EX Series switches
Overview and Topology
This topic includes two examples that describe how to mirror traffic entering ports on the switch to a
destination interface on the same switch (local mirroring). The first example shows how to mirror all
traffic entering the ports connected to employee computers. The second example shows the same
scenario, but includes a filter to mirror only the employee traffic going to the Web.
The interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 serve as connections for employee computers. The interface
ge0/0/10 is reserved for analysis of mirrored traffic. Connect a PC running a protocol analyzer
application to the analyzer output interface to analyze the mirrored traffic.
NOTE: Multiple ports mirrored to one interface can cause buffer overflow and dropped packets.
Both examples use the network topology shown in Figure 38 on page 1091.

Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure an analyzer called employee-monitor and specify the input (source) interfaces and the analyzer
output interface:
1. Configure each interface connected to employee computers as an input interface for the analyzer
employee-monitor:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge–0/0/0.0
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor input ingress interface ge-0/0/1.0
2. Configure the output interface of the analyzer as part of a VLAN:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members analyzer_vlan
[edit vlans]
user@switch# set analyzer-vlan vlan-id 1000
1093
3. Configure the output analyzer interface for the analyzer employee-monitor. This will be the destination
interface for the mirrored packets:
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set analyzer employee-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
Results
Check the results of the configuration:
[edit]
user@switch# show
forwarding-options {
analyzer employee-monitor {

Mirroring Employee-to-Web Traffic for Local Analysis
IN THIS SECTION
Procedure | 1094
To configure mirroring for employee to Web traffic, perform these tasks:
1094
Procedure
CLI Quick Configuration
To quickly configure local mirroring of traffic from the two ports connected to employee computers,
filtering so that only traffic to the external Web is mirrored, copy the following commands and paste
them into the switch terminal window:
[edit]
set forwarding-options port-mirroring instance employee-web-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
set firewall family ethernet-switching filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from
destination-address 192.0.2.16/24
set firewall family ethernet-switching filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from source-
address 192.0.2.16/24
set firewall family ethernet-switching filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
set firewall family ethernet-switching filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from
destination-port 80
set firewall family ethernet-switching filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-
mirroring-instance employee-web-monitor
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure local mirroring of employee to Web traffic from the two ports connected to employee
computers:
1. Configure the local analyzer interface:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/10 unit 0 family ethernet-switching
2. Configure the employee-web-monitor output instance (the input to the instance comes from the action of
the filter):
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@switch# set instance employee-web-monitor output interface ge-0/0/10.0
1095
3. Configure a firewall filter called watch-employee to send mirrored copies of employee requests to the
Web to the employee-web-monitor instance. Accept all traffic to and from the corporate subnet
(destination or source address of 192.0.2.16/24). Send mirrored copies of all packets destined for the
Internet (destination port 80) to the employee-web-monitor instance.
[edit firewall family ethernet-switching]
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from destination-address
192.0.2.16/24
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from source-address 192.0.2.16/24
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
ser@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from destination-port 80
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-mirroring-instance
employee-web-monitor
4. Apply the watch-employee filter to the appropriate ports:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee
user@switch# set ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family ethernet-switching filter input watch-employee

Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created | 1097
Verifying That The Port-Mirroring Instance Is Configured Properly | 1098
To confirm that the configuration is correct, perform these tasks:
Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer employee-monitor or employee-web-monitor has been created on the switch with the
appropriate input interfaces, and appropriate output interface.
Action
You can use the show forwarding-options analyzer command to verify that the analyzer is configured
properly.
user@switch> show forwarding-options analyzer
Analyzer name : employee-monitor
Mirror rate : 1
Maximum packet length : 0
State : up
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/0.0
Ingress monitored interfaces : ge-0/0/1.0
Output interface : ge-0/0/10.0
Meaning
This output shows that the analyzer employee-monitor has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the default
setting), the maximum size of the original packet that was mirrored (0 indicates the entire packet), the
state of the configuration (is up indicates that the analyzer is mirroring the traffic entering the ge-0/0/0,
1098
and ge-0/0/1 interfaces, and sending the mirrored traffic to the ge-0/0/10 interface). If the state of the
output interface is down or if the output interface is not configured, the value of state will be down and
the analyzer will not be programmed for mirroring.
Verifying That The Port-Mirroring Instance Is Configured Properly
Purpose
Verify that the port-mirroring instance employee-web-monitor has been configured properly on the switch
with the appropriate input interfaces.
Action
You can verify that the port-mirroring instance is configured properly by using the show forwarding-options
port-mirroring command.
user@switch> show forwarding-options port-mirroring
Instance Name: employee-web-monitor
Instance Id: 3
Input parameters:
Rate : 1
Run-length : 0
Maximum-packet-length : 0
Output parameters:
Family State Destination Next-hop
ethernet-switching up ge-0/0/10.0
Meaning
This output shows that the employee-web-monitor instance has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the
default), the maximum size of the original packet that was mirrored (0 indicates an entire packet), the
state of the configuration is up and port mirroring is programmed, and that mirrored traffic from the
firewall filter action is sent out on interface ge-0/0/10.0. If the state of the output interface is down or if
the interface is not configured, the value for state will be down and port mirroring will not be
programmed for mirroring.
