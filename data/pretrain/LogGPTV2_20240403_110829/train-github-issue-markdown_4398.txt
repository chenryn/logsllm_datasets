Abstract class should not be required to implement all the properties/methods
of the interfaces it implements. So the following should be legal:
    interface A {
      p;
      m();
    }
    abstract class B implements A {
    }
    class C extends B {
      get p() {...};
      set p(v) {...};
      m() {...}
    }
But currently it gives:
> Error:(2, 16) TS2420: Class 'B' incorrectly implements interface 'A'.
> Property 'p' is missing in type 'B'.
This issue is related to proposal #3578.
