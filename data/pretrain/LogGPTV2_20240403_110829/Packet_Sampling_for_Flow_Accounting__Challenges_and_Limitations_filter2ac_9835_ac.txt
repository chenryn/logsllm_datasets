Fig. 1. Setting D: All Flows (left) and Conformant Flows (right) 
Common  accuracy  requirements  for  accounting  are  a  maximum  relative  error  of 
0.01 or 0.05 with a confidence level of at least 95%. With a sampling fraction of 5% 
the achievable accuracy is too low for the vast majority of flows for all settings. Fig. 1 
(right) shows the flows conformant to StdErr ≤0.05. Only flows with a large number 
of packets Nf achieve an acceptable accuracy. 
Flow  Conformance  from  Empirical  Tests.  In  a  second  step  we  investigate  the 
standard  error  empirically  from  sampling  tests.  For  this  we  performed  R=1,000 
sampling  runs  for  each  scheme.  Table  5  shows  the  results  from  experiments  with 
setting G and different schemes.

The numbers for n-out-of-N sampling correspond quite well to those derived from 
the formula Table 4. For 1-in-K sampling we get quite similar numbers. This is in line 
with previous tests we performed about the scheme differences. Systematic sampling 
performs  a  little  bit  better,  but  the  standard  errors  in  the  tests  differed  much  from 
those  of  n-out-of-N.  A  theoretical  prediction  is  problematic.  Again,  only  few  flows 
get  accuracies  sufficient  for  accounting.    In  order  to  achieve  higher  accuracies  per 
flow  one  can  increase  the  sample  fraction,  work  with  more  coarse  grained 
classifications  or  modify  the  measurement  interval  length.  When  modifying  the 
measurement interval length it is relevant how flow characteristics evolve in order to 
assess the accuracy (see section 3).  
6   Conclusion 
We  investigated  the  applicability  of  packet  sampling  to  flow  accounting.    We 
analyzed basic PSAMP schemes and a stratified scheme used in Cisco NetFlow and 
showed  how  the  accuracy  depends  on  flow  parameters  and  measurement  settings. 
Theoretical considerations were supplemented by experiments with traffic traces from 
three  different  networks.  The  accuracy  for  sampling  before  classification  was  very 
poor.  The  main  reason  is  the  high  number  of  small  flows  in  the  traces.  Longer 
observation periods, coarse grained classification or the aggregation of flows results 
in  larger  flows  and  higher  accuracies.  A  further  option  is  to  use  a  biased  flow 
selection based on the expected accuracy. In addition  we showed how the accuracy 
can  be  derived  from  sampled  values  and  aggregated  information  stored  in  routers 
during  run-time.  For  this,  Cisco  has  included  the  storage  of  the  square  sum  of  the 
packet sizes in NetFlow.

Appendix: Expectation and Variance for n-out-of-N Sampling 
The random variable xi,f denotes the packet size of the ith selected packet from flow f. 
Since  a  random  selection  is  applied,  we  can  assume  that  the  xi,f  are  statistically 
independent. Since nf follows a binomial distribution, the expectation and variance of 
nf is given by formulas for a binomial distribution: 
⎡
E n

f

n

With  these  considerations,  the  task  is  reduced  to  the  calculation  of  expectation  and 
variance  of  a  r.v.  Z,  where  Z  is  the  sum  of  independent  identical  distributed  (i.i.d.) 
random variables X and the number of summands Y is a binomial distributed random 
variable. The expectation of such a r.v. is given in [15].

The expectation of the estimate equals the real volume, i.e. the estimation is unbiased. 
A formula to calculate the variance for this special case, but for continuous random 
variables is derived in [16]. This formula can be also applied for discrete variables.
