# Messages
# Protocols
## AAA
* Radius - Encrypts passw, UDP, 1812/1645 (Well known/IOS default), RFC2865
* TACACS - Encrypts payload, TCP, 49/49, Proprietary
# Timers
# Trivia
* enable password and enable secret - secret stored by MD5, not affected by service pw encryp
 * enable secret precedence
## AAA
### Default methods
* Single method way to auth user
 * Could be radius, could be local
* List tried in order until accept or reject from method
* Default login applies to all logins (Console/Telnet/Aux)
### Multiple auth methods
* No limit to servers
* Try first method, if does not respond, move to next
* If no response for any, reject
## Layer 2 Security
**Unused**
* Disable CDP and DTP
* Access only
* BPDU and Root guard
* DAI or PVLANs
* Port security
* 802.1x
* DHCP Snooping and IP source guard
```
int Fa0/0
 no cdp enable
 switchport mode access
 switchport nonegotiate
 spanning-tree guard root
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```
**Other**
* PVLANs where possible
* VTP auth globally
* Disabled unused ports, put in dead vlan
* Avoid VLAN 1
* Avoid native VLAN on trunks
## Port security
* Dynamic learning, lost on reboot - switch port-security [max-value] - default 1
* Static - switchport port-security mac-address ADDRESS [vlan {id | {access | voice}}]
* Dynamic learning, saved (sticky) - switchport port-security mac-address sticky
## DAI
* GAs can happen, b'cast dest
* Can claim IP of host
* Examines arps, filters inappropriate
* DAI on untrusted
* Inapprorpiate if
 * ARP reply lists source IP not DHCP assigned to device and port
 * As above, static
 * Fo reply, source MAC in header should be source MAC in ARP
 * As above, dest mac and target
 * Unexpected IPs (0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, multicast)
* Requires DHCP snooping, for binding DB
## DHCP snooping
* Table of IP and port mappings
* DAI and Source guard use
* Clients on untrusted, servers on trusted
* Examines client messages on untrusted
* Untrusted port logic
 * Filter all DHCP server messages
 * Check DHCP release, declines against binding - if IP not in table, filtered
 * Optionally, DHCP client hw add with source MAC
### Information Option
* Op 82 inserted when snooping enabled
* Contains port client connected to
* DHCP packets contain giaddr field of 0.0.0.0 by default
* Both show up in error messages if something misconfig
* Will be dropped going between switches
* Avoid with `ip dhcp snooping information option allow-untrusted`
 * Also `ip dhcp relay information trust-all`
## IP Soure Guard
* Adds to DHCP snooping
* Checks source of IP packets against db
* Can check both source IP and MAC
## 802.1x Auth using EAP
* Verified by Radius
* Requires UN and PW
* First EAP in eth frame
* Supplicant to authenticator (switch)
* Frames EAPoL (EAP over LAN)
* Switch translates to RADIUS message
* Supplicant - U/N and PW prompt to user, tx/rx EAPoL
* Authenticator - EAPoL/RADIUS trans, enables/disables ports
* Auth server - Stores creds, verifies rad essages
## Mac Auth Bypass
* For devices without 802.1x capabilities
* Supplmental auth method using EAP
* Migration from port security, VRT and/or VPMs
* 802.1x tries 3 EAP requests sent, if failed, guest VLAN
 * MAB works on this, dynamic policy from RADIUS detailing VLAN if allowed
## General L3 Considerations
* Smurfs - Lots of ICMP echos, dest IP is subnet broadcast, avoid with no ip direct-broadcast
* Enable uRPF with `ip verify unicast source reachable-via {rx | any } [allow-default] [allow-self-ping] [list]`
 * rx - strict
* Fraggles similar but UDP echo
* TCP Intercept 
 * Watch mode - keep s state of tcp connections, resets if three way not complete in time period
 * If large number in a second (defaulf 1100 per second), new TCP filtered
 * Intercept - router replies instead of server, merges if handshake completes
## Classic IOS Firewall
* CBAC
* Inspects traffic
* Based on protocol commands
* Temporarily opens ports
* Works on TCp and UDP
* Config inspect protocols
* TCP easy to handle (can recognize control channel)
* UDP connectionless, so based on relative timer
* Comes after ACLs
* Can't protect internal attacks
* Doesn't inspect local destined or source traffic
* Restrictions on ecnrypted traffic
* Use ip inspect (global for times and thresholds, eg ip inspection actionjackson ftp timeout 3000)
* On int for inspection, apply opposite to ACL
## ZBF
* MQC Style
* Ints in securiy zones
* Blocked bw zones
* Ints talk in same zone
* Ints not in zone blocked
* Uses inspect class and policy maps
## CoPP
* MQC, rate limits or drops
* control-plane, service-policy
## IPv6 First Hop Security
### SeND
* Security for NDP
* Used in router discovery, DAD and addr resolution
* Based on CGA (Crypto Generated Address), or non-CGAs with Certs
* Auths router to act as def gw
* Says what prefixes router allowed to announce
### Secure at First hop
* Inspect ND traffic
* L2/L3 binding
* Monitor use of ND by host
* Can blow RAs and rogue DHCP advertisements
### RA Guard
* RA snooping exists
* Switch uses upper layer info
* Must be an intermediary device all traffic passes through
* `ipv6 nd raguard policy NAME... device-role {host | router}`
* ` int Fa0/0... ipv6 nd raguard attac-policy NAME`
* If hosts, RA dropped
### DHCPv6 Guard
* Blocks replies and adv from unauth servers and relays
* Client messages always switched
* DHCP server messagesonly if device role server
* Can do source vlidation and service pref
* Also server replies for permitted prefixes (match reply)
* match server - matches servers allowed
### DHCPv6 Guard and Binding DB
* v6 snooping builds db table of v6 neighborus
* Create from sources lik DHCPv6
* Validates link layer, v6 addr, prefix binding to prevent spoofing
* Auto populated after enabled
* Integrated with DHCPv6 guard and RA guard
### IPv6 Device Tracking
* Host tracking
* Neighbour table updates if host drops
* Revokes access when inactive
### IPv6 Neighbour Didsocvery Inspection
* Learns and secures SLAAC addresses
* analyzes ND
* Builds trusted binding table
* Trusted if v6-to_MAC mapping verifiable
### IPv6 Source Guard
* No ND or DHCP inspection
* Denies traffic if not in binding table
* Works with ND inspection or v6 address glean
* When traffic denied, v6 glean tries to recover (Queries DHCP server or uses ND)
* Recovers with DHCP_LEASEQUERY to server, DAD NS back
* NA From host, DHCP LEASEQUERY_REPLY comes back
## Control Plane Protection
* Host, Transit, Cef Exception
* CEF required
* Can drop pacekts directed to closed or non-listening TCP/UDP ports
* Can limit amount of packets in control plane input queue
* IPv4 only
* ACLs can't be applied to control plane subints direct (used with MQC policies)
* Host - Destined for RTR or its own ints
* Transit - s/w switched traffic
* CEF - exception (ARP, LDP, L2 keepalives etc)
* Apply a policy map to `control plane {host | cef exception | transit}`, service policy on next line
## IP Source Tracker
* enables tracking for dest addr on router
* CEF entry created, punts to line card/port adapters CPU
* `show ip source-track summary`
* ip source-track address
* ip source-track address-limit NUMBER
* ip source-track syslog interval NUMBER
* ip source-track export-interval NUMBER
 * 30s default 
# Processes
## Enable SSH
1. hostname
2. ip domain-name
3. Client auth method (local user, AAA etc)
4. Gen RSA keys
5. Specify SSH version
6. Disable telnet on VTY
7. Enable SSH on VTY (transport input ssh)
## ZBF
1. Decide zones
2. Zone pairs - traffic between zones (zone-pair security Internal source LAN destination WAN)
3. Class maps, identify traffic
4. Policies
5. Apply policy to zone pair (zone-pair .... service-policy type inspect LAN2WAN - match a policy map with type inspect)
6. Assign ints to zone
