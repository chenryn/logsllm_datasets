User: I'm learning Python from "Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw, and can't figure out: 

I'm working in Powershell. How do I add a line of text to my python script (ex1.py) from the PowerShell terminal? I've tried (starting in PowerShell): Add-Content ex1.py "print "Hello"" and other variations, but I get the message: 


Add-Content : A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument 'Hello'. 

How do I run just one of the seven lines of text ex1.py currently has? Without doing some extra bash script? Again, I'm working from the Windows PowerShell terminal, so I don't think bash applies there.
Assistant: Use Add-Content ex1.py 'print "Hello"'
Use python.exe -c "<cmd>" to execute a single python command.
