### Server Operational Costs and DHCP Lease Time Optimization

**Objective:**
To optimize the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lease times for devices in a network, we aim to balance efficient address space utilization with minimal broadcast traffic and server load. This is particularly important given the diverse types of devices (smartphones, laptops, etc.) and their varying usage patterns.

**Methodology:**

1. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - We first analyze the behavior of individual devices by varying the DHCP lease times over several orders of magnitude.
   - Based on these observations, we determine an optimal approach that best meets our goals.

2. **Simulation:**
   - A simulator was developed to reproduce DHCP behavior and measure key metrics such as address space utilization, broadcast messages, and server load.

**Sleep Policies:**
- Devices can have different sleep policies, such as never sleeping, never sleeping when plugged in, sleeping when the screen turns off, or sleeping after 15 minutes. These policies significantly impact the effectiveness of DHCP lease times.

**Network Administrator Insights:**
- Educational network administrators confirmed that they set the lease time to a relatively short 900 seconds to manage the high turnover of devices in their environment.

**Simulation Results:**

**Figure 5: Metrics vs. Lease Time**

- **Address Space Utilization (Figure 5a):**
  - Shorter lease times result in more efficient address space utilization but increase broadcast traffic and server load.
  - For corporate networks, the threshold for efficient utilization is around 1000 seconds for iOS devices, 2000 seconds for Androids, and 4000 seconds for laptops.
  - In educational networks, the thresholds are halved due to shorter active periods.

- **Broadcast Messages (Figure 5b):**
  - Laptops generate fewer broadcasts as most of their DHCP messages are unicast renewals.
  - Smartphones, with their shorter active periods, generate more broadcasts, especially with shorter lease times, leading to more frequent full DHCP handshakes.

- **Server Load (Figure 5c):**
  - Server load levels off at about 1000 seconds for smartphones and 10,000 seconds for laptops, reflecting the longer active periods of laptop users.

**Policy Evaluation:**

- **Static Policies:**
  - Fixed lease times of 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 12 hours were evaluated.

- **Exponential Adaptation:**
  - Allocates a short initial lease and doubles the lease time with each renewal.

- **Differential Lease:**
  - Assigns different lease times based on device type. For example, in the corporate network, iOS devices get 1000 seconds, Androids 2000 seconds, and Windows/Mac OS X 4000 seconds. In the educational network, the values are halved.

**Simulation Results (Figure 6):**

- The differential lease policy provides a good tradeoff between address space utilization, broadcast traffic, and server load.
- It is nearly as efficient as the 15-minute lease policy but with lower overhead.
- Exponential adaptation uses more address space but generates less broadcast traffic and server load.

**Related Work:**

- Previous studies have investigated the impact of lease times on DHCP performance but did not differentiate between device types.
- Our work combines DHCP and TCP/UDP behavior to better understand network usage patterns and proposes leasing policies tailored to different device types.

**Conclusion:**

- Network administrators must carefully allocate DHCP lease times to accommodate the variety of devices in wireless local area networks.
- Smartphones are the primary drivers of increased address space utilization, and fixed lease time policies are often suboptimal.
- The proposed differential lease policy, which assigns different lease times based on device type, reduces unnecessary DHCP-related overhead and is adaptable to changing device mixes without requiring protocol changes.
