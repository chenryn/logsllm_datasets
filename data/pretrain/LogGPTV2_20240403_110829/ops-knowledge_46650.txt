User: I have Celery tasks chain that I call with apply_async. Each task in chain depends on the result from previous task.
Basically the worklof looks like this:

Fetch data from DB.
For each fetched row run chain with tasks.

Behaviour that I want to achieve is to run multiple chains at one time. But it seems like it runs them in a row, not simultaneously. How to fix this issue?
Assistant: If you want to run chains at once you will need to run more than one worker.
