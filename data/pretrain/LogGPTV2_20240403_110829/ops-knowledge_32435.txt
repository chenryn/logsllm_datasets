User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to completely remove New Relic application My server is running Centos 5.8 64 bit and I installed New Relic a short while ago to try and solve a few performance issues - as the server is not especially high spec I found it used too much system resources so I removed it using the Purge method as recommended on their site. https://newrelic.com/docs/general/how-do-i-uninstall-the-new-relic-agent#php

Even after doing this I keep getting messages from lfd warning about excess resource usage for New Relic and I dont know how to completely remove it. The warning from lfd is:

Time:         Sat Jan 26 10:31:14 2013 +0000

PID:          1794 (Parent PID:1793)

How can I get totally rid of New Relic?
