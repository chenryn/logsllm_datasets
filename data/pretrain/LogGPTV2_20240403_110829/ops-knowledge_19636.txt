User: How to detect whether a system has been hacked, and countermeasures?
Assistant: The following measures can be taken to detect whether a system has been attacked by hackers: 1. Regularly conduct security assessment and vulnerability scanning to discover security vulnerabilities in the system in time. 2. Monitor system hosts and network traffic to find abnormal behavior, such as a large number of network connections or different operating system logins. 3. Watch the syslog for any unusual events and activity such as failed logins, file access, etc. 4. Detect whether system files have been tampered with or changed, such as executable files, configuration files, and system libraries. Countermeasures: 1. Timely repair the discovered security holes and upgrade the version of security network equipment. 2. Strengthen authorization control, implement stricter authentication and access control, and limit access to sensitive data. 3. Strengthen password security, set complex password policies, and change passwords frequently. 4. Install anti-virus software, firewall and other security protection software to detect and intercept in real time. 5. Strengthen employee safety education, improve employee safety awareness and behavior, and avoid safety incidents caused by human negligence. 6. Do a good job of safety backup and back up important data in time to ensure that data is not lost and avoid the impact of ransomware attacks.
