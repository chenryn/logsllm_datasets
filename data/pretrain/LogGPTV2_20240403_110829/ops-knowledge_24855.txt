User: Is there any cross-platform way to check that my Python script is executed with admin rights? Unfortunately, os.getuid() is UNIX-only and is not available under Windows.
Assistant: It's better if you check which platform your script is running (using sys.platform) and do a test based on that, e.g. import some hasAdminRights function from another, platform-specific module.
On Windows you could check whether Windows\System32 is writable using os.access, but remember to try to retrieve system's actual "Windows" folder path, probably using pywin32. Don't hardcode one.
