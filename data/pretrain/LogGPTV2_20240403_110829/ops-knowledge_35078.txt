User: How to perform database backup and recovery? Please provide a common backup and recovery scenario.
Assistant: Database backup and recovery is a very important part of database management, which can ensure the reliability, integrity and recoverability of data. The following is a common backup and recovery scheme: 1. Database backup: - Regular backup, such as once a day; - Lock the database during backup to prevent data from being modified; - Backup to a reliable storage medium, such as a disk array, tape or Cloud storage, etc.; - Backup includes not only data files, but also log files, configuration files, etc.; 2. Database recovery: - When a failure occurs, you first need to check the backup log to find the latest available backup; - Choose a complete backup, And determine whether to apply incremental backup or differential backup; - Before restoring the backup, you need to close the database first, and copy the backup file to the specified directory of the recovery server; - After performing the recovery operation, you need to start the database again after recovery; In addition, It is also necessary to test during the backup and recovery process, and regularly check the validity of the backup files to ensure the reliability of the backup and the correctness of the recovery.
