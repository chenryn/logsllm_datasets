Abstract
The ability to detect what unlicensed radios are operating in a neigh-
borhood, their spectrum occupancies and the spatial directions their
signals are traversing is a fundamental primitive needed by many ap-
plications, ranging from smart radios to coexistence to network man-
agement to security. In this paper we present DOF, a detector that in
a single framework accurately estimates all three parameters. DOF
builds on the insight that in most wireless protocols, there are hidden
repeating patterns in the signals that can be used to construct unique
signatures, and accurately estimate signal types and their spectral and
spatial parameters. We show via experimental evaluation in an indoor
testbed that DOF is robust and accurate, it achieves greater than 85%
accuracy even when the SNRs of the detected signals are as low as
0 dB, and even when there are multiple interfering signals present.
To demonstrate the beneﬁts of DOF, we design and implement a pre-
liminary prototype of a smart radio that operates on top of DOF, and
show experimentally that it provides a 80% increase in throughput
over Jello, the best known prior implementation, while causing less
than 10% performance drop for co-existing WiFi and Zigbee radios.

INTRODUCTION
The ability to detect what unlicensed radios are operating in a
neighborhood, what parts of the spectrum they are occupying, and
what spatial directions their signals are traversing is a fundamental
primitive that is needed by many applications. For example, smart
and agile radios such as [28, 22] could use it to detect what spectral
resources are unused, and exploit them to provide high throughput.
They could detect what spatial directions are unoccupied, and direc-
tionally steer their signals to further increase capacity. They could
also use the primitive to be gentle when needed, if a low power med-
ical wireless sensor is operating in the neighborhood, the smart ra-

dio could detect it and take extra measures to avoid causing inter-
ference to the sensor, lest some critical communication is impaired.
Similarly, network administrators can use such a primitive to man-
age their “airspace", improve channel allocation and diagnose perfor-
mance problems. Recent work [27] has explored using detectors that
compute what spatial directions signals arrive at for wireless network
security. Thus, a large and growing number of applications could
beneﬁt from such a primitive.
However, building such a detector that operates accurately across
the large range of SNRs signals exhibit, in the presence of multiple
interfering signals, or in the rich indoor multipath environment of
the unlicensed ISM band is hard. Prior implemented systems have
mostly focused on spectrum occupancy detection, and used threshold
based methods that estimate changes in received signal energy [16] or
the variations in the FFT [28] to estimate spectrum occupancy. How-
ever, optimal thresholds that work accurately across the rich variety
of conditions (in SNR, multipath, interference etc) are hard to pick,
and consequently these methods have low accuracy. Other work [22,
16] has used higher layer protocol behavior signatures to detect ra-
dio types. However, these techniques also rely on threshold based
methods to detect the protocol behavior, and suffer from the same
problems as above.
In this paper we present Degrees Of Freedom (DOF), a single
framework that accurately detects what radios exist in a neighbor-
hood, what parts of the spectrum they occupy, and their angles of ar-
rival (AoA) at the detector. We believe this to be a ﬁrst. DOF is robust
and works accurately (around 90% accuracy) in a large SNR range (0
to 30dB) as well as in the presence of multiple interfering signals.
DOF is passive and does not impose any measurement overhead, it
can operate even when the detecting radio is being used for other
communication. Finally, DOF is efﬁcient to implement, it builds on
top of commonly available FFT modules and requires modest extra
resources ( 30% more computation compared to a standard FFT).
The key insight behind DOF is the observation that for most wire-
less protocols, there are hidden repeating patterns that are unique
and necessary for their operation. For example, Wiﬁ uses a repeat-
ing cyclic preﬁx to avoid intersymbol interference between consecu-
tive OFDM symbols. A Zigbee radio has a repeating pulse which it
uses for QPSK data transmission, Bluetooth has a Gaussian pulse on
which it modulates data bits using FSK that is repeating with a differ-
ent frequency and so on. DOF exploits the existence of these patterns
to create unique signatures for each signal type. Further, DOF shows
that the same signatures can also be exploited to determine the spec-
trum occupied and the AoA of that signal type.
Algorithmically, DOF extracts feature vectors using the following
key idea: if a signal has a repeating hidden pattern, then a delayed
version of the signal correlated with the original signal will show
peaks at speciﬁc delay intervals. These intervals form a signature for
each signal and can be used to extract feature vectors. We build on
230prior work [9, 19] in cyclostationary signal analysis to design an efﬁ-
cient feature extraction technique based on standard FFT operations.
However, DOF’s key contribution over prior work in cyclostationary
analysis is to show that the extracted feature vector encodes informa-
tion about the component signal types, what spectrum they occupy,
as well as what AoAs they arrive at the detecting radio. DOF de-
signs a novel SVM decision tree to classify component signal types,
and new algorithms to estimate their spectrum occupancies as well as
AoAs from the feature vector.
We implement DOF using the fftw [1] library and GnuRadio [3]
software on a wideband radio that is capable of operating over the
entire 100 MHz ISM band and has 4 MIMO antennas. We evaluate
DOF using testbed experiments in an indoor ofﬁce environment and
compare it to three prior approaches, RFDump [16] for signal type,
Jello [28] for spectrum occupancy, and SecureAngle [27] for AoA
estimation (the best known implemented systems for each component
respectively). We ﬁnd that:
(cid:15) DOF is accurate and robust at all SNRs, it classiﬁes co-existing
radio types with greater than 85% accuracy even at SNRs as
low as 0dB. On the other hand, RFDump is at most 60% accu-
rate at SNRs lower than 8dB.
(cid:15) DOF is robust to interference, achieving more than 82% ac-
curacy in detecting component signal types even when there
are three overlapping and interfering signals. The compared
approach RFDump cannot operate in this case.
(cid:15) DOF’s spectrum occupancy estimates are more than 85% ac-
curate at low SNRs or in the presence of interference. The
compared approach, Jello has an error of 35%, and cannot de-
tect individual spectrum occupancies of interfering component
signals.
(cid:15) DOF’s AoA estimation error is less than 6 degrees for SNRs as
low as 0dB, and is the same as SecureAngle.
DOF is practical and can be applied to many problems. While we
leave most of DOF’s applications to future work, we demonstrate the
potential beneﬁts of DOF for building smart and agile radios by de-
signing and implementing a preliminary prototype, DOF-SR. The key
novel component in DOF-SR is that it’s aggressiveness in scavenging
for unused spectral resources can be tuned by a user speciﬁed policy
so that interference to co-existing radios is controlled. To demon-
strate this ﬂexibility we implement three sample policies, from one
which only uses unoccupied spectrum and minimizes interference to
co-existing radios to ones which use microwave oven occupied spec-
trum and compete with co-existing WiFi radios. We deploy DOF-
SR in our indoor testbed and compare it with Jello [28] (which uses
edge detection for ﬁnding unused spectrum). Our evaluation shows
that DOF-SR provides nearly a 80% throughput increase over Jello in
crowded environments. Further, the co-existing WiFi/Zigbee radios
suffer less than 10% throughput drop with DOF-SR, while Jello can
cause nearly a 45% throughput drop. DOF-SR outperforms because
it can accurately detect (un)occupied spectrum even at low SNRs as
well as the occupying signal types, allowing it to more accurately
scavenge unused spectrum, yet guarantee that it does not affect the
co-existing radios.
2. RELATED WORK
DOF bridges and builds upon related work in signal detection and
cyclostationary signal analysis. We discuss both of them below.
2.1 Signal Detection
Detecting Radio Type: Prior work such as RFDump and others [16,
22] has used unique protocol characteristics (e.g. 10(cid:22)s delay between
data and ACK WiFi packets) to infer radio type. The basic approach
is to detect the start and end of packets using energy detection in the
time domain, and use the delays between packets to estimate radio
type. However, energy detection is not accurate at medium to low
SNR, and fails if there are multiple interfering signals as we show in
our evaluation in Sec. 6. Other work [20] has used preamble corre-
lation to detect radio type by exploiting known preambles at the start
of a packet. However this technique doesn’t work for legacy analog
signals such as microwaves, cordless phones etc which don’t have
preambles. Further, as prior work has shown [10], preamble corre-
lation requires coarse synchronization to the carrier frequency of the
detected signal, which becomes expensive given the large number of
carrier frequencies for different radio types in the ISM band.
Detecting Spectrum Occupancy: Prior work such as Jello [28] has
used edge detection on the power spectral density of the received sig-
nal to estimate spectrum occupancy. The basic idea is to compute
the slope of the PSD at every point, and detect signal starts and ends
based on thresholds on the slope. However, at low SNRs and for sig-
nals whose spectral masks are not of good quality, the accuracy of this
approach is low because noise and spectral leakage can cause sharp
spikes in the slope away from where the signal is located. Further,
this approach fails when we have multiple interfering signals who
also overlap in the frequency domain, since a edge will be detected
as soon as the ﬁrst signal ends, in spite of the second signal which oc-
cupies some more portion of the spectrum. Other approaches based
on energy detection such as SpecNet [12] also suffer at low SNRs and
are unable to distinguish between overlapping signals.
Detecting Angle of Arrival: Prior work such as SecureAngle [27]
has used classic AoA estimation algorithms [14, 6, 23] to compute
AoAs of the incoming signals. These approaches are highly accu-
rate, and we show in our evaluation that DOF’s accuracy is similar.
Further, DOF can automatically associate a signal type with the AoA
(e.g. a WiFi signal is impinging at 45o), while prior approaches need
separate detectors to associate signal type.
DOF thus provides a single framework that estimates all three pa-
rameters, and with accuracy better than the best known implemented
techniques for each component.
2.2 Cyclostationary Signal Analysis
DOF builds on prior work in cyclostationary signal analysis, which
was pioneered in the early 90’s through the work of Gardner [9], and
has been used widely in a variety of applications [11, 24, 17, 29].
Further, recent work [8, 7] has used neural network classiﬁers with
cyclostationary features to detect the type of modulation used in a
received signal. Finally, recent work has implemented cyclostation-
ary techniques on the USRP platform [21, 19, 4] and evaluated its
effectiveness for detection and rendezvous in cognitive networks.
As we will see in Sec. 3, DOF builds on this prior work to design
an efﬁcient feature extraction technique. However, DOF differenti-
ates itself from all prior work in cyclostationary signal analysis in the
following ways:
(cid:15) DOF designs an efﬁcient linear-time classiﬁcation technique
based on hiearchical SVMs to estimate the type of multiple
overlapping signals. Prior approaches based on neural net-
works [8, 7] have cubic computational complexity and those
based on SVMs [15] are limited to classifying a single signal.
DOF’s technique is robust to the presence of multiple interfer-
ing signals and can reuse the same SVM decision tree for clas-
sifying all component signal types. To the best of our knowl-
edge, we are not aware of prior work in cyclostationary analysis
that has handled detection of multiple interfering signals.
(cid:15) DOF extends cyclostationary signal analysis to detect angle of
arrivals, and designs a novel algorithm that computes AoAs as
well as associates the signal type with the signal on each AoA.
(cid:15) DOF is implemented on a wideband radio, and has been eval-
231uated extensively in an indoor testbed with ﬁve different inter-
fering signal types (WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Analog Cordless
phones and microwave signals). We are not aware of any work
that provides a similar extensive evaluation.
(cid:15) We also design and build a preliminary prototype of a smart ra-
