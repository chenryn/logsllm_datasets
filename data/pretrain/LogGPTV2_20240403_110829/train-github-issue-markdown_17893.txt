Hi
I am having problem using proxy with Scrapy, I have private proxy with HTTPS
supported.
I tried with simplest spider without proxy with the following extensions:  
EXTENSIONS = {  
'scrapy.extensions.telnet.TelnetConsole': None,  
}  
SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES = {  
'scrapy_splash.SplashDeduplicateArgsMiddleware': 100,  
}  
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {  
'scrapy_splash.SplashCookiesMiddleware': 723,  
'scrapy_splash.SplashMiddleware': 725,  
'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcompression.HttpCompressionMiddleware': 810,  
}
It worked fine 200 ok response
Then I configured the proxy as suggested in the documenation:  
https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-
middleware.html?highlight=proxy#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy
  1. 
added this to the middle ware:  
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {  
...  
'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware': 1  
...  
}
  2. I added the meta key proxy per each request as follows:  
request = SplashRequest(url='https://www.example.com', callback=self.parse,
endpoint='execute',  
args={'wait': 1,  
'lua_source': login_script,  
'timeout':90,  
}  
)  
request.meta['proxy'] = proxy  
yield request
where proxy = 'https://username:password@proxyip:proxyport'
I am getting the error below when running scrapy:  
2019-07-19 16:11:29 [scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.retry] DEBUG: Retrying  (failed 1 times):
[]
I tried to fix by using the values of DOWNLOADER_CLIENT_TLS_METHOD such as:  
'TLSv1.0' 'TLSv1.1' 'TLSv1.2' 'SSLv3'  
but it didn't change anything same error.
Thanks
