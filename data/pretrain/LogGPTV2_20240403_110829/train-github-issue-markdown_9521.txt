### Issue Description

**Environment:**
- **Software Version:** Atom 0.120.0
- **Operating System:** macOS (with a case-insensitive file system)

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Left-click the file "test.php" in the Atom editor's tree view to open it.
2. Right-click the same file and select "Rename."
3. Rename "test.php" to "Test.php."

**Observed Behavior:**
- The tab label for the opened file does not update and still displays "test.php."
- If you click on the file again (even though it is already open in a tab), a second tab is created, resulting in two tabs: one labeled "test.php" and one labeled "Test.php."
- Due to the case-insensitive nature of the file system, both tabs point to the same file.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The tab label for the opened file should update to "Test.php" when the file is renamed.

This issue causes confusion and redundancy, as the user ends up with multiple tabs pointing to the same file.
