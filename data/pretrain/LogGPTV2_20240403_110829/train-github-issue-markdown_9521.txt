With Atom 0.120.0, on OSX (with case insensitive filesystem).
What I did:  
First i left-click the file "test.php" in the Atom editor tree view to open
it.  
Next I right-click the same file and select "Rename".
What happens:  
When i rename "test.php" to "Test.php", the opened file tab label does not
update, and still says "test.php".  
If I now click this file (to open it, it was already open in a tab) - i end up
with two tabs, one "test.php", one "Test.php". Due to the case insensitivity
of the file system I use, they happen to point to the same file.
What I expected to happen:  
The opened file tab label to change to "Test.php" when i renamed the file.
