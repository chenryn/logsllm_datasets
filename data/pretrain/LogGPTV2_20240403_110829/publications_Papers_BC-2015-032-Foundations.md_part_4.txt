### Skills-Intensive Services
Skills-intensive services [28] rely on professional skills. Both knowledge-intensive and skills-intensive services are forms of labor-intensive services. Cedefop [28] further distinguishes between the following categories:
- Elementary manual resources (workers)
- Skilled manual resources (agricultural, craft, and trade workers, machine operators)
- Skilled non-manual resources (clerks and service/sales workers)
- High-skilled non-manual resources (legislators, managers, professionals, and technicians)

The latter category is certainly coincident with knowledge-intensive resources. Physicians are generally distinguished by their professional knowledge, but surgeons and dentists additionally need special manual skills to perform their work.

### Information-Intensive Services
Information-intensive services involve substantial information processing [29]. This may include collecting, manipulating, interpreting, and transmitting data to create value [30]. Information can be collected and processed by people, as in opinion surveys (over the phone or face-to-face) or criminal investigations.

With the increasing availability of electronic data, collection and processing can be automated using information and communication technology (ICT). Examples of ICT-based information-intensive services include news ticker services, financial information services, traffic information services, remote diagnostic services, and internet search engines. The proliferation of instrumentation technology in everyday life (sensors, GPS, vehicle telematics, surveillance cameras) has led to an explosion in the amount of available data ("big data"). Extracting valuable information from this data has become more sophisticated, leading to the field of "big data analytics."

### Technology-Intensive Services
Technology-intensive services have a very low or zero proportion of labor. These services are delivered by purely technological resources—machines or computer programs. Such technology-based services can be used by customers in a self-service mode (see Figure 1.6.d) or by technological resources (typically computer programs) on the customer's side (see Figure 1.6.e).

Today, the predominant technology used in services is ICT. The widespread adoption of ICT, particularly the internet, has revolutionized the world of services, leading to concepts such as Electronic Services, Web Services, Cloud Services, the Internet of Things, and the Internet of Services. These concepts will be discussed in the next chapter.

### 1.3 Services and Goods
Why compare services with goods? Services and goods are quite different realities. Operations Management provides a clear distinction: goods are "things" typically produced through a manufacturing process, while services are transformation processes themselves.

The attempt to compare services with goods and to define services in contrast to goods arose in the discipline of Service Marketing. For marketing professionals, both services and goods are economic commodities that are promoted and sold by companies. Often, not only goods but also services are referred to as products of a company. Since the marketing discipline traditionally focused on goods, the orientation towards services was mainly governed by the question: What are the differences between marketing goods and marketing services?

This legitimate question resulted in considerable but questionable efforts to answer a different question: What differentiates services from goods? The most popular outcome of this discourse is the so-called IHIP criteria: intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability, and perishability. IHIP criteria have been embraced by many scholars in lectures and textbooks because they are easy to understand and memorize. However, they have led to misconceptions such as "services are intangible goods" or "the more intangible, the more something is a service." It is well-known that IHIP criteria "do not distinguish services from goods" [13] and "should not be used as generic service characteristics" [31], as "services and goods belong to quite different logical categories" [8].

While IHIP criteria are not entirely useless, they can indeed help in understanding the differences in marketing and management of services versus goods.

#### 1.3.1 Differences in Marketing and Management
In the following, two cases will be discussed where the difference between services and goods is particularly crucial.

##### Inseparability and Demand Management
The first case addresses the consequences of separability/inseparability on demand management and pricing of services and goods. Figure 1.9 shows two situations:
- (a) The fluctuating demand curve for automobile tires, with peaks in fall for winter tires and in spring for summer tires.
- (b) The fluctuating demand for a call center with peaks in incoming calls daily around noon.

(a) describes a situation that a manufacturer must handle, while (b) represents a problem for a service provider.

The tire manufacturer has the advantage of being able to produce tires ahead of time and prepare for the peaks occurring in fall and spring. This requires good forecasting methods to predict the upturn and peak point of the demand curve for the coming season. If done intelligently, the manufacturer can fulfill all demands and yet smooth out tire production so that manufacturing resources are almost constantly utilized throughout the year.

The service provider does not have this advantage: calls need to be answered by call center agents at the exact time they come in. There is no "pre-production" of responses due to inseparability. To fully meet demand, the call center must employ as many agents as there are calls during peak times. Agents are only fully utilized during peak periods; in other periods, some agents are idle. This phenomenon is common in many service situations, such as the fluctuating demand for electricity, flights, and hotel rooms.

**Example — Fluctuating Demand of a Call Center**
To avoid customer waiting times, call centers employ enough agents to cover peak demands. As a consequence, call center agents are often idle during off-peak periods. This is costly for the employer and tedious for the agents. A German call center decided to provide additional workload when agents are not busy answering calls. Agents were assigned the task of transcoding medical diagnoses written in free text into machine-readable ICD-10 codes (the International Classification of Diseases coding system). Results showed that agents were more satisfied with the new steady workload than before.

To cope with this challenging situation, service providers have adopted various management practices. One practice is demand aggregation: the provider tries to acquire loads with different demand patterns to take advantage of statistical effects that reduce variability in the aggregated demand. An example is a call center that serves different time zones, where the peaks of one time zone might fall into the quiet periods of another time zone, thus smoothing out overall demand.

Another practice is demand conditioning: the provider offers incentives to customers to use the service during off-peak periods. These incentives typically include lower prices in off-peak periods and higher prices in peak periods. This is a common practice in the travel industry (hotels, airlines, railways). Prices can vary over the year, depending on the attractiveness of the traveling location in a particular season, over the week (working days, weekends), and sometimes even over the day (early morning, late night).

Electricity service providers also experience high demand variability with seasonal, weekly, and daily fluctuations caused by climate/temperatures, length of daylight and dark, working hours in offices and factories, and behavioral characteristics of private households (lighting, heating, cooling, cooking, washing). With the availability of smart meters, energy providers can offer flexible electricity prices on an hourly basis to their customers. If customers change their consumption patterns in response to lower prices, energy providers can avoid costly demand peaks, smooth out demand, and increase the efficiency of their operations.

##### Intangibility and Advertising
The second case addresses the consequences of "intangibility" on the advertising of services. Advertising relies on the presentation of products (goods and services) in marketing channels. Only in shops and showrooms can products be physically presented and "tangible" for the customer (can be touched). In other channels, such as newspapers, advertising walls, TV, or the internet, products can only be virtually presented or pictured for advertising. Tangibility is no longer an issue; one should rather talk about the picturability of a product.

It is clear that "tangible goods" are easiest to display in showrooms and pictured in ads. The situation for services—and similarly for intangible goods like music and videos—is more difficult. The advertisement of services has been a major concern for marketing professionals for many years [32, 33]. Services are activities or transformation processes, which are not picturable like tangible goods (call this intangibility if you will). However, substitutes can be found to make services picturable. A popular substitute is to picture physical delivery resources of a service (a friendly-looking newsboy with his vehicle) or happy customers while receiving or after having received a service (Figure 1.10). The condition of a customer can be pictured before and after the service (hair transplant, cosmetic surgery).

Other possibilities include citing past performance characteristics or presenting customer testimonials [33]. Substitutes are also used in advertising intangible goods. An ad for a newly released CD cannot picture the musical content but can picture substitutes like the CD cover, a portrait of the musician, or the musician in action interpreting the music in a concert room.

**Example — IBM Stand on CeBIT with Mercedes-Benz Actros**
An eye-catcher at the computer fair CeBIT 2012 was a big Mercedes Actros truck on the IBM stand. It attracted people who were curious to understand what a truck had to do with IBM’s offerings. They learned that the Actros symbolized an intelligent logistics solution that IBM had developed for the Mercedes-Benz truck manufacturing plant within a service project. IT services are hard to present at a fair. As a substitute, the truck was a perfect tangible object that helped promote IBM’s service capabilities.

#### 1.3.2 The Dual Nature of Services
The word "service," as used in this book so far, refers to an activity or transformation process. However, in colloquial language, "service" sometimes has a slightly different meaning. It might refer to the resources provided to deliver the service. Consider the following two sentences:
- A turbulence hit the airplane during the meal service.
- My neighbor owns a dry cleaning service.

In the first sentence, an activity or transformation process is clearly meant. In the second sentence, a set of resources is implied. This colloquial ambiguity is another reason why the IHIP criteria are difficult to digest. In the first case, intangibility and perishability are clearly given (the meal service is an activity and, as such, intangible and has a beginning and an end). In the second case, this is not the case (the dry cleaning service consists of tangible resources that continue to exist).

##### The Process and Resource Nature
One could speak of two natures or dimensions of a service. This subtle difference has hardly been noticed and conceptualized in academic literature. Donabedian [34] distinguished between the structural dimension and process dimension of a service. Shostack [35] mentioned that "services exist in two states of being": in a potential state (where they may be "stored") and in a kinetic state corresponding to the actual rendering. Both authors express the same idea in different words. In the terminology used in this book, one could distinguish between the "resource nature" or "resource dimension" and the "process nature" or "process dimension" of a service.

In most cases, when people speak about services, they have the process dimension in mind. Sometimes, the resource nature shines through. Would everyone accept, as a theoretician would, that a massage is an intangible service? No—because people think of the hands of a masseuse operating on the body of a client, a sensible, tangible experience! Colloquial language does not clearly distinguish between the two natures of a service.

##### Services in Computer Science
In academic discourse, it should be precisely ascertained which service dimension (nature) prevails in a particular context. In computer science, "services" and "web services" are terms that describe fundamental programming paradigms. Services are "software components of distinct functional meaning" [36], or "software programs with distinct design characteristics" [37]. Web services are "self-describing, self-contained software modules" [38], or "software applications with a published programming interface" [33], and web services "can be sold, too" [39].

From these definitions, it is clear that computer scientists use the term "service" consistently in its resource dimension, and their service has more characteristics of a good (can be sold, can be stored) than of an activity or transformation process. However, the process dimension sometimes "shines through."

The novelty of this textbook is that it combines the concepts of services as they are used in economics and as they are used in computer science. Both disciplines have an unambiguous understanding of the term "service." Treated in isolation, there is no problem. But when the concepts of the two disciplines are brought together, the result is a comprehensive and nuanced view of services.
