1.3 Services and Goods
Why should one compare services with goods? Services and goods are quite
different realities. Operations Management has come up with a clear picture:
Goodsare“things”thataretypicallytheoutputofamanufacturingprocess,and
servicesaretransformationprocessesbythemselves.
Theattempttocompareserviceswithgoods,and,moreover,todefineservices
incontrasttogoods,aroseinthedisciplineofServiceMarketing. Formarketing
people,servicesandgoodshaveonethingincommon:bothareeconomiccommodi-
tiesthatarepromotedandsoldbycompanies. Veryoftennotonlygoods,butalso
services,arecalledtheproductsofacompany. Sincethemarketingdisciplinetradi-
tionallyfocusedongoods,theorientationtowardsserviceswasmainlygoverned
bythequestion: Whatarethedifferencesbetweenmarketinggoodsandmarketing
services? Thislegitimatequestionresultedinaconsiderablebutquestionableeffort
toansweradifferentquestion: Whatdifferentiatesservicesfromgoods?
The most popular outcome of this discourse are the so-called IHIP criteria:
intangibility,heterogeneity,inseparability,andperishability. IHIPcriteriahave
beenembracedbymanyscholarsinlecturesandtextbooks,becausetheyareeasyto
understandandeasytomemorize. Unfortunately,theyhaveledtomisconceptions
like“servicesareintangiblegoods”or“themoreintangible,themoresomething
isaservice”. ItislongknownthatIHIPcriteria“donotdistinguishservicesfrom
goods”[13]and“shouldnotbeusedasgenericservicecharacteristics”[31]-–no
wonder,because“servicesandgoodsbelongtoquitedifferentlogicalcategories”[8].
ButIHIPcriteriaarenotuseless.Theyindeedcanhelptounderstandthedifferences
inmarketingandmanagementofservicesversusmarketingandmanagementof
goods.
1.3.1 DifferencesinMarketingandManagement
In the following, two cases will be discussed in which the difference between
servicesandgoodsisparticularlycrucial.

Theserviceproviderdoesnothavethisadvantage: callsneedtobeanswered
by the call center agents at exactly the time when they are coming in. There is
no“pre-production”ofresponses(duetoinseparability). Ifthedemandshallbe
completelyfulfilled,thecallcenterhastoemployasmanyagentsascallscomein

manydifferentservicesituations: thedemandforelectricityisheavilyfluctuating
duringtheday,thedemandforflightsandhotelroomsisfluctuatingduringtheyear,
etc.
Example — Fluctuating Demand of a Call Center. To avoid customer
waiting-times,callcentersemployenoughagentstocoverpeakdemands. As
aconsequence,callcenteragentsareoftenidleduringoff-peakperiods. This
is costly for the employer and tedious for the agents. A German call center
decidedtoprovideanadditionalworkloadwhentheyarenotbusyanswering
calls. Agentswereassignedthetranscodingmedicaldiagnoseswrittenwithfree
textintomachine-readableICD-10codes(theInternationalClassificationof
Diseasescodingsystem). Resultsshowedthatagentsweremoresatisfiedwith
thenewsteadyworkloadthantheywerebefore.
Tocopewiththischallengingsituation,serviceprovidershavetakenadvantage
of different management practices. One practice is demand aggregation: the
providertriestoacquireloadswithdifferentdemandpatternstotakeadvantageof
thestatisticaleffectsthatreducevariabilityintheaggregatedemand. Anexampleis

intothequietperiodsoftheothertimezone,andthustheoveralldemandsmooths
out.
Another practice is demand conditioning: the provider offers incentives to
customers to use the service in off-peak periods. These incentives are typically
lowerpricesinoff-peakperiodsandhigherpricesinpeakperiods. Thisiscommon
practice in the travel industry (hotels, airlines, railways). Prices can vary over
theyear(dependingontheattractivenessofthetravelinglocationinaparticular
season),overtheweek(workingdays,weekends)andsometimesevenovertheday
(earlymorning,latenight).
Electricityserviceprovidersalsoexperiencehighdemandvariability.Theyhave

IntangibilityandAdvertising

services. Advertisingreliesonthepresentationofproducts(goodsandservices)

suchasnewspapers,advertisingwalls,TV,orinternet,productscanonlybevirtually

Itisclearthat“tangiblegoods”areeasiesttobedisplayedinshowroomsand

majorconcernofmarketingpeopleformanyyears[32,33]. Servicesareactivities
ortransformationprocesses. Anactivityortransformationprocessisnotpicturable
like a tangible good (call this intangibility if you will). But substitutes can be
found that make services picturable. A popular substitute is to picture physical
deliveryresourcesofaservice(afriendlylookingnewsboywithhisvehicle)or
happycustomerswhilereceivingorafterhavingreceivedaservice(Figure1.10).
The condition of a customer can be pictured before and after the service (hair
transplant,cosmeticsurgery).
Other possibilities are citing past performance characteristics, or presenting
customertestimonials[33].Substitutesarealsousedinadvertisingintangiblegoods.

1.3.2 TheDualNatureofServices
The word “service”, as it was used in this book so far, refers to an activity or
transformation process as defined earlier. But in colloquial language, the word
“service”sometimeshasaslightlydifferentmeaning. Itmightrefertotheresources
thatareprovidedtodelivertheservice. Considerthefollowingtwosentences:
• Aturbulencehittheairplaneduringthemealservice.
• Myneighborownsadrycleaningservice.
In the first sentence, clearly an activity or transformation process is meant,
inthesecondsentence, asetofresources. Thiscolloquialambiguityisanother
reasonwhytheIHIPcriteriaaresodifficulttodigest. Inthefirstcase,intangibility
andperishabilityareclearlygiven(themealserviceisanactivity–andassuch
intangible,otherthanathing-andithasabeginningandanend). Inthesecond
case absolutely not (the dry cleaning service consists of tangible resources that
continuetoexist).

ServicesinComputerScience
In the academic discourse, it should be precisely ascertained which service di-
mension(nature)prevailsinaparticularcontext. Incomputerscience,“services”
and“webservices”aretermsthatdescribefundamentalprogrammingparadigms.
Servicesare“softwarecomponentsofdistinctfunctionalmeaning”[36],or“soft-
wareprogramswithdistinctdesigncharacteristics”[37]. Webservicesare“self-
describing,self-containedsoftwaremodules”[38],or“softwareapplicationswitha
publishedprogramminginterface”[33],andwebservices“canbesold,too”[39].
