identities such as phone numbers. To prevent abuse, we suggest
Signal use anonymous credentials, implemented with blind
signatures, and implement a prototype that demonstrates our
solution is performant and cost-effective to deploy.
Signal has taken a ﬁrst step into providing anonymous com-
munication to millions of users with the sealed sender feature.
Signal’s design puts practicality ﬁrst, and as a result, does
not provide strong protection against even known disclosure
attacks. Nonetheless, we believe this effort can be improved
upon without sacriﬁcing practicality, and we hope that our
work provides a clear path toward this end.

APPENDIX
A. Proof of Theorem 1
Consider ﬁrst an arbitrary non-associate Charlie, with prob-
ability rc of appearing in a random or target epoch. We ﬁrst
analyze the probability that Alice appears above Charlie in the
ranking after n random and target epochs.
Recall that the attack maintains a “score” for each user,
increasing by 1 each time the user appears in a target epoch,
and decreasing by 1 each time the user appears in a ran-
dom epoch. Deﬁne 2n random variables X1, . . . , Xn and
Y1, . . . , Yn, corresponding to the signed difference in Alice and
Charlie’s scores during each of the n random epochs (Xi’s)
and target epochs (Yi’s). So each Xi, Yi ∈ {−1, 0, 1} and the
1≤i≤n(Xi + Yi) is the difference in Alice and
Charlie’s score at the end of the attack. We wish to know the
probability that ¯X > 0.
sum ¯X = (cid:80)
By the stated probability assumptions, we know the ex-
pected value of all of these random variables: E[Xi] = rc−ra,
E[Yi] = ta − rc, and therefore by linearity of expectation,
E[ ¯X] = n(ta − ra). Crucially, note that this is independent of
Charlie’s probability rc because we included the same number
of random and target epochs.
We can now apply Hoeffding’s inequality [27] over the sum
of these 2n independent, bounded random variables Xi, Yi to
conclude that Pr[ ¯X ≤ 0] ≤ exp(−n(ta − ra)2/4).
Noting that this bound does not depend on the particular
non-associate Charlie in any way, we can apply a simple union
bound over all ≤ m non-associates to obtain the stated result.
B. Proof Of Security For One-Way Sealed Sender Conversa-
tions
We now give a proof that the protocol in Section VI-B
realizes the ideal functionality in Figure 6. As mentioned, we
give this proof in the standalone model with static corruptions.
We deﬁne the simulator Sim as follows:
startup, Sim generates
Setup: At
long-term key pairs
(pkPi, skPi) for each honest user Pi ∈ PH. Next, Sim receives
a public key pkPj for each corrupt user Pj ∈ PC from the
adversary.
Sim initializes an empty table T with format
(cid, Ps, pks,cid, sks,cid, Pr, pkr,cid, skr,cid)
is
the identity of
where Ps
the conversation initiator,
(pks,cid, sks,cid) is the keypair used by Ps in conversation
cid, Pr is the initial receiver, and (pkr,cid, skr,cid) is the
keypair used by Pr in conversation cid. Some elements in
these entries may be empty if Sim does not know the value.
We will represent unknown elements with ·.
Sim also initializes an empty message table M with format
(cid, mid, c)
Note that the deﬁnition presented in Figure 6 is in terms
for pull notiﬁcations, while the protocol in Section VI-B is
in terms of push notiﬁcations. However, the push notiﬁcation
in the protocol, modeled after how Signal actually works,
are essentially a sustained pull. That is, opening a longterm
connection is equivalent to having the receiver continuously
sending pull requests to the server. To bridge this gap, the
simulator maintains a list of open connections. At each time
step, the simulator iterates through the list of open connections
are sends a ReceiveMessage to the ideal functionality of that
players part. Similarly, we expect that honest users will do this
if they want push-style notiﬁcations.

Sim retrieves the longterm information for user Pr, i.e.

b) Send c to Pservice
If Sim gets c(cid:48) from Pservice for Pr and c = c(cid:48), Sim
performs the following
a) sends an acknowledgment to Pservice on behalf of Pr
for Ps
b) receives the acknowledgment on behalf of Ps
c) sends (Approve) to ideal functionality
Otherwise, Sim sends (Disapprove) to the ideal function-
