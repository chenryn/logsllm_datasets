picking, body twisting, eating (for a long time), bottom uplifting
(simulating sex behavior), dancing, walking, running. Among these
activities, the first 5 are considered privacy-concerning by over
39% people according to the existing survey [9]. Additionally, the
dataset covers a variety of realistic situations including different IR
distances/angles and curtain deformation.
Model implementation. The DeShaNet is implemented using
Pytorch [27] and trained on a GPU server. The scene constructor is
implemented in Unity 3D [37]. The virtual curtain is implemented
using Obi cloth [25], which provides fine grained control and simu-
lation of the curtain surface. The 3D dummy is derived from the
PuppetMaster [36].
Baseline methods. We choose the 3D Mask R-CNN [11] as
our baseline for keypoint detection. We fine-tune the original 3D
Mask R-CNN implementation [10] on our dataset by fine-tuning
the keypoint detection head branch and the classification head. The
tube proposal network and CNN backbone remain unchanged.
7 EVALUATION
7.1 Evaluation of the DeShaNet
We first evaluate the proposed DeShaNet by varying one scene
parameter while fixing others to the default. By default, the curtain
deformation is u-shape, IR distance is 2.6m, IR angle 0◦ and subject
ID is 1. The datasets are split into training set and testing set. All the
models are trained on the same training set and evaluated on the
testing set with the same training epoch. The evaluation metric in
this section is 2D detection error in pixel. Considering the average
field of view is about 3.6*2 meters and the image size is 384*216,
a pixel corresponds to 9.3 mm. The exact conversion factors may
change according to the actual environment.

Different curtain deformation. In this experiment, both the
training data and the testing data include 4 kinds of curtain de-
formation: vertical deformation, random deformation, U-shape de-
formation and no deformation. The results in Table 3 show that
DeShaNet has the lowest error on all kinds of deformations, which
is 32% lower than 3D Mask R-CNN on average. This indicates the
design of SFFM and CAM in DeShaNet eliminate the performance
bottleneck of the 3D Mask R-CNN on shadow keypoint detection.
Additionally, the error of DeShaNet w/ deformation is only 2.02
larger than w/o deformation, the increase rate of which is 62%
smaller than the 3D Mask R-CNN. This indicates the deformation
largely impacts the detection, and DeShaNet can solve the problem
very well. Although different curtain deformations have different
visual impacts, DeShaNet shows consistent performance, indicating
that it achieves good generalization ability.
On the other hand, to verify the performance boost by the SFFM
and CAM, we implement two extra baseline models : DeShaNet
-CNN and the vanilla-CNN. These two are essentially the CNN
parts of DeShaNet (CNN backbone + CEM). The difference is the
DeShaNet -CNN is trained together with the overall DeShaNet and
the vanilla-CNN is trained separately. The results show that De-
ShaNet -CNN outperforms the vanilla-CNN on all kinds of curtain
deformation, with 38% lower error on average. It confirms that the
SFFM and CAM components of DeShaNet can indeed boost the
overall performance of the CNN part through joint training. We
illustrate several examples under severe curtain deformation in Fig.
10 (a)-(d).
Different IR source distance/angle. We now vary the IR dis-
tance and angle, and summarize the results in Table 4. When the
IR distance is within a specific range ( 60◦). The shadow stretching error of small angles is only around
0.27, showing that the IRSPE restores the human activity precisely.
In contrast, the shadow stretching errors at large angles are 1.6×
larger, so IRSPE cannot precisely restore the human skeleton in such

cases. The underlying reason is the detection error of DeShaNet
and error of IRSPE both increases with angle.
On the other hand, the results in Table 8 show that the error of
the IRSPE increases slightly with distance when it is within the
margin value (< 4.2m). The IR position error and the stretching
error are only 0.06 and 0.14. When the IR distance exceeds the
margin value, the position error and stretching increase obviously
to 0.65 and 0.33. This is mainly due to the low IR illumination
intensity beyond the margin distance.
Evaluation of LLE. We further verify whether the LLE can
accurately estimate the relative limb length of different subjects.
Recall the shadow keypoints are detected by DeShaNet first, and
then converted to shadow limb length, which is used by LLE to
estimate the 3D relative limb length. The results in Table 9 show
that the maximum relative limb length error is 0.034 (subject 3),
