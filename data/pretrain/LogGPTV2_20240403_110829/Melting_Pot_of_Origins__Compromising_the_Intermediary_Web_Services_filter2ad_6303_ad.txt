### Evaluation of Fingerprinting and Web Rehosting Services

#### A. Testing the Fingerprintability of Websites

To evaluate the fingerprintability of websites, we conducted an experiment using a set of 10,000 websites listed in the Alexa top-10K. We excluded websites that did not complete the session within 15 seconds, resulting in 6,500 reachable websites. Each website was visited twice via a web rehosting service, specifically ProxySite, due to its fast response. The browser was cleaned (i.e., browsing data deleted) after each visit.

Let \( W \) be the set of websites to be examined, and \( F(w) \) be the fingerprint of a website \( w \in W \). The fingerprint is determined as:
\[ F(w) = K(w, 1) \cap K(w, 2), \]
where \( K(w, n) \) is the set of keys extracted from the website \( w \) during the \( n \)-th trial (\( n \in \{1, 2\} \)). If a set of keys appears in both trials, they are extracted as the fingerprint of the website. A fingerprint \( F(w) \) is considered unique if it satisfies the following condition:
\[ F(w) \neq F(x) \quad \forall x \in W \setminus \{w\}. \]

We tested this condition for the 6,500 accessible websites and found that 39.1% (2,541) of the websites were uniquely identifiable by our proposed fingerprint. Table V presents the top-10 categories of fingerprintable websites, based on the Alexa list. These categories include popular and niche sites, such as email, chat, adult content, videos, news, animation, portals, encyclopedias, programming, and photos. This diversity implies that an attacker can estimate a victim's profile through history theft attacks. Additionally, we identified sensitive sites like porn, dating, and piracy websites, which can be used for further social engineering attacks.

#### B. Lifetime of Fingerprints

The evaluation of fingerprint uniqueness did not consider the expiration of cookies. Cookies with an expiration date will be deleted, reducing the uniqueness of fingerprints. Session cookies, which do not have an expiration date, may or may not be deleted when the browser process is terminated, depending on the user's environment. Unlike cookies, `localStorage` retains data persistently.

To study the impact of elapsed time on fingerprint uniqueness, we performed an experiment simulating the deletion of expired cookies after a user visits a website. We assumed each website was visited once. Figure 6 shows the change in the availability of website fingerprints over time, considering two scenarios: when all session cookies are alive and when they are expired.

- At zero elapsed time, the percentages of available fingerprints are 100% (session cookies alive) and 96.4% (session cookies expired).
- After one day, the percentages drop to 69.4% (session cookies alive) and 64.2% (session cookies expired).
- The decline slows down after day two, as cookies with longer lifetimes and persistent `localStorage` keys contribute to fingerprint uniqueness.
- Small spikes at the 30th, 60th, and 90th days reflect the common practice of setting cookie expiration dates in units of months.
- On day 364, the percentages are 64.3% (session cookies alive) and 58.6% (session cookies expired), but on day 365, they drop to 59.7% (session cookies alive) and 53.6% (session cookies expired).

In summary, more than 50% of website fingerprints remain effective for history theft for up to one year after the website visit.

#### C. Fingerprints Leaking User Visit Time

Cookies often have an expiration time set to the visit time plus a period. By subtracting this increment from the cookie expiration time, an attacker can deduce the visit time. This allows for more precise tracking of users' website transitions. We found that 73.6% of fingerprints leaked visit times.

#### D. Resource Accesses Behavior for Each Browser

We investigated the differences in resource access behavior across eight browsers, as shown in Table VI: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, Opera, Brave, and the mobile version of Chrome. All versions were the latest as of September 2019.

Table VII summarizes the results. Service workers and AppCache are available on all browsers except Internet Explorer, which does not support service workers. The differences in resource access behavior can impact the success and failure of attacks.

### Conclusion

Our experiments demonstrate that many web rehosting services are vulnerable to browsing history theft. The effectiveness of fingerprinting techniques, the lifetime of fingerprints, and the leakage of visit times all contribute to the potential for such attacks. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing better security measures.
