User:  Please analyze a common server load balancing algorithm in detail, as well as its applicable scenarios, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: common server load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. The polling algorithm refers to assigning client requests to each server in turn, each request selects the next server in a linear order, and when the last server is accessed, the assignment starts from the beginning. This algorithm is a very simple load balancing algorithm, easy to implement, and suitable for large-scale cluster systems. Applicable scenarios: The polling algorithm is suitable for scenarios where server performance is relatively balanced, that is, each server has similar processing capabilities and there is no particularly high access pressure. Because the polling algorithm will distribute requests evenly, it cannot effectively solve the problems of uneven server performance and load. Advantages: 1. Simple to implement and easy to deploy; 2. Can distribute requests evenly, with good fairness; 3. Can effectively handle large-scale cluster systems. Disadvantages: 1. Unable to deal with uneven server performance and uneven load; 2. Unable to schedule requests according to server processing performance, which may cause some servers to be overloaded; 3. Unable to adapt to the complexity of requests.
