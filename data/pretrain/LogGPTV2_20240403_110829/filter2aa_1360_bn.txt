This is the most common filter which presents profiles of people. Further filtering includes location and 
employer. This URL would find people named John Wilson.
Posts: (https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=john wilson)
This option is similar to Facebook and presents posts including the provided search tenns. This helps find 
content about (or by) our target. Further filters include search by date, author, and industry’.

It is impossible to mention even a fraction of potential networks which may contain online evidence about your 
target. Instead, I focus on those which have large numbers of members and are common to most internet users. 
My goal was to present various investigation tactics within each popular community which can be carried over 
to networks which are not discussed.
When it comes to business-related social networking sites, Linkedln is the most popular. It is owned -j 
Microsoft and currendy has more than 675 million subscribers internationally. The site requires searchers to 
create a free profile before accessing any data. As with any social network, I recommend creating a basic account 
with minimal details. The search field of any page offers a search using a real name, company, location, or title. 
These searches will often lead to multiple results which identify several subjects. The site was redesigned in 2020, 
which provides new options. The upper center portion of any search result page will offer some basic 
refinements to the search to filter by People, Posts, Companies, Groups, Jobs, Schools, and Events. These can 
also be queried by direct URL. The following includes a summary of each filter and the direct search URL which 
we will add to our custom search tools.
On the contrary, I believe online communities cater to a niche audience and are likely ignored by the masses 
which do not have a similar interest. I place TikTok and dating sendees in this category’. Most people on Tinder 
are single and TikTok primarily consists of a young audience. These are specialty sites with which my mother is 
unfamiliar (I hope).
I divide general social networks and online communities over the next two separate chapters. For OSINT 
purposes, I believe social networks are defined as generic areas which cater to a wide audience with various 
interests. We see much more general engagement between members within these platforms. People from all 
walks of life are on Linkedln and Snapchat, regardless of their profession or age.
As an example, the Google "site" queries which will be used to identify Linkedln content can also be used for 
hundreds of other networks. Please watch for techniques instead of specific resources or links. I promise that 
the following methods will need to be adjusted over time, but the overall strategies should prove to be useful 
when we see changes in the search infrastructure from the networks.
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will each provide more data than all other social networks combined. 
However, there are many other options, and all should be researched. While we see high usage on the most 
popular sites, we may not see much incriminating evidence. Instead of finding your suspect confessing to your 
investigation on Facebook or Twitter, you may be more likely to find his grandmother testifying to his innocence. 
Smaller networks often provide more intimate details. Your suspect may feel exposed on the bigger networks, 
but a bit more private on smaller websites.

Schools: (https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/schools/?keywords=john wilson) 
This queries schools with the keywords in the title.

This queries events with the keywords in the tide.
Companies: (https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?keywords=john wilson)
This query strictly identifies companies which include the searched keywords. Further filters include location, 
industry’, and company size.

Clicking the three dots within a post allows you to copy a static URL of the content, which is beneficial 
during documentation.

Expanding all comments before generating a screen capture presents additional evidence within your 
documentation.

Many posts are redacted to save space. Click "...see more" to 
generating a screen capture.
Jobs: (https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/index/?keywords=john%20wilson)
This presents current job openings and includes numerous additional filters. While beneficial for employment­
seekers, I find this less useful than die other queries when my target is a person. However, it can be quite useful 
when investigating a company. Network penetration testers can use this to identify software applications used 
by the client, which could lead to identification of vulnerabilities.
The profiles on Linkedln often contain an abundance of information. Since this network is used primarily for 
business networking, an accelerated level of trust is usually present. Many of the people on this network use it 
to make business connections. Some of the profiles will contain full contact information including cellular 
telephone numbers. This site should be one of the first stops when conducting a background check on a target 
for employment purposes. The target profile often contains previous employment information, alumni details, 
and work associates. Aside from searching names and businesses, you can search any keywords that may appear 
within someone's profile. Since many people include their phone numbers or email addresses in their profile, 
this can be an easy way to identify the user of that specific data. Visiting this profile identifies further information 
as well as confirmation of the target number. You can also search Linkedln for a specific username, which may 
be directly associated with a profile. As an example, the following URL connects directly to a target.
In years prior, Linkedln was a place to create a profile and communicate directly with another person. Today, it 
is a true social network with Posts, Likes, and Comments. Conducting a keyword search through any Linkedln 
page or my own custom tool will present anything applicable. From there, consider the following.
Groups: (https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/groups/?keywords=john wilson)
This option presents Linkedln groups which contain your keyword within the title or description. It does not 
search for member names.
Knowing the real name of your target will be most beneficial. The results page should include the target's 
employer, location, industry, and possibly a photo. After identifying the appropriate target, clicking the name 
will open that user's profile. If searching a common name, the filters will help limit options.
Searching by Personal Details

Instead of the default "keywords" parameter, let's force a change with the following URL.

which looks almost identical to the Instagram options.

If you wanted to go further, we could specify his title (Manager) and school (Oklahoma) in the following URl . 
If you know these details about your target, you could start with this, but I find that providing too many details 
can work against you. Figure 13.01 displays the result of this URL, which identified the only person on Linkedln 
which fit the criteria.
If you are searching for employees of a specific company, searching the company name often provides numerous 
profiles. Unfortunately, clicking on any of these profiles presents a very limited view with the name and details 
redacted. The name of the employee is usually not available, but the photo and job description are usually visible.
The previous URL query is the most precise option we have. This has been the most beneficial structure 1 have 
found to navigate directly to my target. However, it can fail. If your suspect did not provide the school attended 
or current employer to his profile, you will not receive any leniency from Linkedln within this search. However, 
we can rely on Google to help us. Your target may have mentioned an employer somewhere else within the 
profile or listed a school within the "Interests" area. The following reveals many profiles associated with the 
target.
You might get lucky and find your target with a simple name search. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. With 
hundreds of millions of profiles, Linkedln must make some assumptions when choosing the profiles to display 
after a search. This is especially true with common names. Let's conduct several queries as part of a 
demonstration of Linkedln's URL structure. Searching "John Smith" produces practically useless results at the 
following URL.
Changing to "firstName" displays content associated with people named John. This is still fairly unhelpful and 
includes a lot of content which is not applicable to our target. Now, let's specify the full name of our target in 
the following URL.
The results now only include links to profiles of people with the real name of John Smith. This is much more 
useful and may be all you need to identify your target. With a name such as John Smith, we need to go a few 
steps further. The following URL adds his employer (Microsoft).

Another way to accomplish this is to navigate through the profiles in the "People also viewed" column. These 
pages include other profiles viewed that are associated with whichever person you are currently analyzing. These 
people may not be friends or co-workers with your target, but there is a connection through the visitors of their 
pages. As an example, I returned to the Google search at the top of this page. I clicked on the first search result, 
which was not my target. However, in the "People also viewed" area to the right, 1 saw 
full name and a link to her complete profile. Figure 13.03 (right) displays this result.
Finally, the last option is to conduct a reverse image search on the photo associated with the target's profile. Full 
details of this type of search will be presented later. For this demonstration, I will right-click on her photo and 
choose "Copy image location". On the Google Images page, I can click the camera icon and submit this URL. 
While the first result is not the target, clicking the page does present a link to the target's unmasked page. 1 will 
later explain many detailed ways to fully query reverse image search options within the upcoming Images chapter.
Search for the business name of your target company, or the employer of your target individual. 1 typed "Uber" 
into the search bar and received the official business page on Linkedln. Clicking the "See all 88,788 employees 
on Linkedln" link presented me with numerous employee profiles such as those visible in Figure 13.02. Notice 
the names are redacted and only "Linkedln Member" is available. Clicking this first result prompts me with 
"Profiles out of your network have limited visibility. To see more profiles, build your network with valuable 
connections". We struck out, but there are ways that you can proceed in order to unmask these details. First, 
copy die entire job description under the "Linkedln Member" tide. In this example, it is "Account Executive at 
Uber". Use this in a custom Google search similar to the following.
Linkedln Member

Current: Subcontractor at Uber
Tlie results listed will vary from personal profiles to useless directories. Since Uber is such a large company, I 
had to view many pages of results until I identified my target. When 1 opened the 24,h search result, the Linkedln 
page loaded, and her photo confirmed it was the correct target. The easier way would have been to search the 
images presented by Google. After the above search is conducted, click on the Images option within Google 
and view the results. Figure 13.03 (left) displays a section, which easily identifies the same image as the Linkedln 
Larger. Clicking this wall load the profile page with full name and details.

both Bing and Linkedln, and indexes Linkedln data well. The following search on Bing replicates our "

You may want a quick way to collect the publicly available details from the profiles that you find. One option is 
to have Linkedln generate a PDF of the information. While on any profile, click the "More..." button and 
choose "Save to PDF". This will not extract any private details, but will make data collection fast.
The results may be overwhelming. Often, 1 know the face of my target and I simply want to browse imag<L 
from Linkedln. The following URL queries Google for any images (&tbm=isch) associated with my targets 
name (john+smith) on Linkedln (sitedinkedin.com). In a moment, we will replicate all of this with my tools.
When all else fails, go to Google. It scrapes and indexes most of Linkedln's profiles and pages. The following 
search would identify profiles of our target, followed by the direct URL.

While Linkedln is an American company, it is a global social network. If you know that your target is in a specific 
country, you can filter your search accordingly. This can be done manually by navigating to a foreign subdirectory 
such as uk.linkedin.com (UI<), ca.linkedin.com (Canada), or br.linkedin.com (Brazil). Each of these pages query 
the entire Linkedln network, but each places emphasis on local individuals.
Many Linkedln posts contain embedded videos. While a keyword search directly on Linkedln may not find 
them, a query on Google should. The following URL replicates our image search, but focuses only on videos

Even' Linkedln method presented until now requires you to possess a valid Linkedln account and to be logged 
in to see any content. Without an active account, all Linkedln pages display a prompt to log in. This can be an 
issue if you do not have an account or your departmental policies prohibit the use of any credentials during an 
investigation. We can solve this with Google's Mobile Friendly Test (search.google.com/tcst/mobile-friendly).
Enter any Linkedln URL, such as the profile located at http://linkedin.com/in/ambcrmac. The result appears 
as the mobile view of this profile including the target's name, image, and bio. Figure 13.04 (left) displays the 
results from the target Linkedln URL without an account while Figure 13.04 (middle) displays the results of the 
same URL on Google's test page. We can also submit scarch.google.com/test/mobile- 
friendly?url=http://linkedin.com/in/ambermac directly within our browser to replicate this process. This is a 
great start, but the results are limited. The preview only displays a portion of the Linkedln profile. Instead, 
consider the following.
Finally, we should always consider Yandex as a Linkedln search engine. The following search 
replicates our Google attempt, followed by die direct URL.
