### Chapter 13: Social Networks: General

#### Introduction
It is impossible to cover every potential social network that may contain online evidence about your target. Instead, this chapter focuses on the most popular networks with large user bases and common to most internet users. The goal is to present various investigative tactics within each popular community, which can be applied to other, less discussed networks.

#### LinkedIn (linkedin.com)
LinkedIn is the most popular business-related social networking site, owned by Microsoft, with over 675 million subscribers internationally. To access data, you need to create a free profile. It is recommended to create a basic account with minimal details. The search field allows you to search by real name, company, location, or title. Searches often yield multiple results, identifying several subjects. The site was redesigned in 2020, offering new options for refining searches.

#### Search Filters and URLs
- **People**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=john wilson`
  - This filter presents profiles of people. Further filtering includes location and employer.
- **Posts**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=john wilson`
  - This option presents posts including the provided search terms. Additional filters include date, author, and industry.
- **Schools**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/schools/?keywords=john wilson`
  - This filter queries schools with the keywords in the title.
- **Events**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/events/?keywords=john wilson`
  - This filter queries events with the keywords in the title.
- **Companies**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies/?keywords=john wilson`
  - This filter identifies companies with the searched keywords. Further filters include location, industry, and company size.
- **Jobs**: `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/index/?keywords=john%20wilson`
  - This filter presents current job openings with additional filters. While useful for employment seekers, it is less useful for person-based investigations but can be valuable for company investigations.
- **Groups**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/groups/?keywords=john wilson`
  - This filter presents LinkedIn groups with the keyword in the title or description. It does not search for member names.

#### Tips for Documentation
- Clicking the three dots within a post allows you to copy a static URL of the content, which is beneficial for documentation.
- Expanding all comments before generating a screen capture presents additional evidence.
- Many posts are redacted to save space. Click "see more" to view the full content before capturing.

#### Profiles and Contact Information
LinkedIn profiles often contain an abundance of information, as the network is primarily used for business networking. Many profiles include full contact information such as cellular telephone numbers. This makes LinkedIn a valuable resource for background checks, especially for employment purposes. Profiles typically contain previous employment information, alumni details, and work associates. You can also search for specific usernames, which may be directly associated with a profile.

#### Searching Techniques
- **By Personal Details**:
  - `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/firstName—john&lastName—smith`
  - `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/firstName—john&lastName—smith&company=microsoft`
  - `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/firstName=john&lastName=smith&company=microsoft&title=manager&school=Oklahoma`

- **By Company**:
  - `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/firstName—john&lastName—smith&company=microsoft`

- **By Country**:
  - Manually navigate to foreign subdirectories like `uk.linkedin.com` (UK), `ca.linkedin.com` (Canada), or `br.linkedin.com` (Brazil).

#### Using Google and Bing
- **Google**:
  - `site:www.linkedin.com john smith microsoft`
  - `https://www.google.com/search?q=site:linkedin.com+john+smith&tbm=isch` (for images)
  - `https://www.google.com/search?q=site:linkedin.com+john+smith&tbm=vid` (for videos)

- **Bing**:
  - `https://www.bing.com/search?q=site:linkedin.com+john+smith+microsoft`
  - Bing is preferred for LinkedIn queries because Microsoft owns both Bing and LinkedIn, and indexes LinkedIn data well.

#### Bypassing Login Requirements
- **Google's Mobile-Friendly Test**:
  - `http://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?url=http://linkedin.com/in/ambermac`
  - This method displays the mobile view of a LinkedIn profile without requiring a login.

- **HTML Source Code**:
  - Use tools like CodeBeautify (codebeautify.org/htmlviewer) to view the entire LinkedIn profile by copying and pasting the HTML source code.

- **Yandex**:
  - `https://www.yandex.com/search/?text=site%3Alinkedin.com+john+smith+microsoft`

#### Conclusion
While Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide more data than other social networks, smaller networks often offer more intimate details. Your suspect may feel more exposed on larger networks but may share more private information on smaller sites. Always consider using a combination of search engines and techniques to gather comprehensive information.
