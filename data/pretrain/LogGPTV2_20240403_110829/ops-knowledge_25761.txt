User: Is there a way to declare which signals are subscribed by a Python application over DBus? 
In other words, is there a way to advertise through the "Introspectable" interface which signals are subscribed to. I use "D-Feet D-Bus debugger".
E.g. Application subscribes to signal X (using the add_signal_receiver method on a bus object).
Assistant: This is probably not possible since a signal is emitted on the bus and the application just picks out what is interesting. Subscribing is not happening inside dbus.
