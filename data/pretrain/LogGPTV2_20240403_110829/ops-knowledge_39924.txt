User: This is a very dumb question. I have a python script that I am running on multiple files using a for loop:
for i in *; do ./file.py -i $i -o $i"_out"; done
Now, during this operation if I alter the script, will it change for the next execution in the loop ?
Assistant: Yes, it will change for the next execution of the loop.
The shell re-reads and executes ./file.py for each iteration.
