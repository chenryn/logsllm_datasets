User: I have installed python 2.7 beside 2.6 on a CentOS 6.5 os.  The particular application I want to install needs 2.7, but it also needs pygtk (as well as other stuff).  If I start an interpreter with 2.6, it imports pygtk fine.  But if I start an interpreter with 2.7 it can not find what it needs [pygtk].
There are plenty of helpful posts that address installing duplicate versions of python on CentOS 6, but could someone please help me make the python 2.7 find the other stuff [pygtk]?
Why else would I want to install python 2.7 beside python 2.6 on CentOS if I didn't want to use a bunch of the standard things in both?
Assistant: Unfortunately packages that are installed with one minor version of Python are not able to be used with another minor version (as an example, version 2.7.8 is major version 2, minor version 7, micro version 8). Different micro versions are compatible with one another, so packages installed with 2.7.3 will work with 2.7.8, for example. So, while it may seem redundant, anything that you have with 2.6 you'll have to reinstall with 2.7 in order to work with it under 2.7. This is due to changes in the ABI from version to version, and other "under the hood" differences.
