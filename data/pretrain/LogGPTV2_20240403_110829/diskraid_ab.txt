Parameters
Parameter
Description
object
Specifies the type of object to select, including: provider, subsystem, controller, drive, or LUN.
hbaport []
Sets the focus to the specified local HBA port. If no HBA port is specified, the command displays the currently selected HBA port (if any). Specifying an invalid HBA port index results in no in-focus HBA port. Selecting an HBA port deselects any selected initiator adapters and initiator portals.
iadapter []
Sets the focus to the specified local iSCSI initiator adapter. If no initiator adapter is specified, the command displays the currently selected initiator adapter (if any). Specifying an invalid initiator adapter index results in no in-focus initiator adapter. Selecting an initiator adapter deselects any selected HBA ports and initiator portals.
iportal []
Sets the focus to the specified local iSCSI initiator portal within the selected iSCSI initiator adapter. If no initiator portal is specified, the command displays the currently selected initiator portal (if any). Specifying an invalid initiator portal index results in no selected initiator portal.
provider []
Sets the focus to the specified provider. If no provider is specified, the command displays the currently selected provider (if any). Specifying an invalid provider index results in no in-focus provider.
subsystem []
Sets the focus to the specified subsystem. If no subsystem is specified, the command displays the subsystem with focus (if any). Specifying an invalid subsystem index results in no in-focus subsystem. Selecting a subsystem implicitly selects its associated provider.
controller []
Sets the focus to the specified controller within the currently selected subsystem. If no controller is specified, the command displays the currently selected controller (if any). Specifying an invalid controller index results in no in-focus controller. Selecting a controller deselects any selected controller ports, drives, LUNs, target portals, targets, and target portal groups.
port []
Sets the focus to the specified controller port within the currently selected controller. If no port is specified, the command displays the currently selected port (if any). Specifying an invalid port index results in no selected port.
drive []
Sets the focus to the specified drive, or physical spindle, within the currently selected subsystem. If no drive is specified, the command displays the currently selected drive (if any). Specifying an invalid drive index results in no in-focus drive. Selecting a drive deselects any selected controllers, controller ports, LUNs, target portals, targets, and target portal groups.
lun []
Sets the focus to the specified LUN within the currently selected subsystem. If no LUN is specified, the command displays the currently selected LUN (if any). Specifying an invalid LUN index results in no selected LUN. Selecting a LUN deselects any selected controllers, controller ports, drives, target portals, targets, and target portal groups.
tportal []
Sets the focus to the specified iSCSI target portal within the currently selected subsystem. If no target portal is specified, the command displays the currently selected target portal (if any). Specifying an invalid target portal index results in no selected target portal. Selecting a target portal deselects any controllers, controller ports, drives, LUNs, targets, and target portal groups.
target []
Sets the focus to the specified iSCSI target within the currently selected subsystem. If no target is specified, the command displays the currently selected target (if any). Specifying an invalid target index results in no selected target. Selecting a target deselects any controllers, controller ports, drives, LUNs, target portals, and target portal groups.
tpgroup []
Sets the focus to the specified iSCSI target portal group within the currently selected iSCSI target. If no target portal group is specified, the command displays the currently selected target portal group (if any). Specifying an invalid target portal group index results in no in-focus target portal group.
[]
Specifies the  to select. If the  specified is not valid, any existing selections for objects of the specified type are cleared. If no  is specified, the current object is displayed.

setflag
Sets the currently selected drive as a hot spare. Hot spares can't be used for ordinary LUN binding operations. They're reserved for fault handling only. The drive must not be currently bound to any existing LUN.
Syntax
setflag drive hotspare={true | false}
Parameters
Parameter
Description
true
Selects the currently selected drive as a hot spare.
false
Unselects the currently selected drive as a hot spare.
shrink
Reduces the size of the selected LUN.
Syntax
shrink lun size= [noerr]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
size
Specifies the desired amount of space in megabytes (MB) to reduce the size of the LUN by. To specify the size using other units, use one of the following recognized suffixes immediately after the size:B - byteKB - kilobyteMB - megabyteGB - gigabyteTB - terabytePB - petabyte.
noerr
For scripting only. When an error is encountered, Diskraid continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
standby
Changes the status of the paths to the currently selected host bus adapter (HBA) port to STANDBY.
Syntax
standby hbaport
Parameters
Parameter
Description
hbaport
Changes the status of the paths to the currently selected host bus adapter (HBA) port to STANDBY.
unmask
Makes the currently selected LUNs accessible from the specified hosts.
Syntax
unmask lun {all | none | [add] wwn= [; [;â€¦]] | [add] initiator=[;[;â€¦]]} [uninstall]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
all
Specifies that the LUN should be made accessible from all hosts. However, you cannot unmask the LUN to all targets in an iSCSI subsystem.You must logout of the target before you run the unmask lun all command.
none
Specifies that the LUN should not be accessible to any host.You must logout of the target before you run the unmask lun none command.
add
Specifies that the hosts specified must be added to the existing list of hosts that this LUN is accessible from. If this parameter is not specified, the list of hosts supplied replaces the existing list of hosts that this LUN is accessible from.
wwn=
Specifies a list of hexadecimal numbers representing world-wide names from which the LUN or hosts should be made accessible. To mask/unmask to a specific set of hosts in a Fibre Channel subsystem, you can type a semicolon-separated list of WWN's for the ports on the host machines of interest.
initiator=
Specifies a list of iSCSI initiators to which the currently selected LUN should be made accessible. To mask/unmask to a specific set of hosts in an iSCSI subsystem, you can type a semicolon-separated list of iSCSI initiator names for the initiators on the host computers of interest.
uninstall
If specified, uninstalls the disk associated with the LUN on the local system before the LUN is masked.
You must logout of the target before you run the unmask lun all command.
unmask lun all
You must logout of the target before you run the unmask lun none command.
unmask lun none
Scripting Diskraid
Diskraid can be scripted on any computer running a supported version of Windows Server, with an associated VDS hardware provider. To invoke a Diskraid script, at the command prompt type:
diskraid /s 
By default, Diskraid stops processing commands and returns an error code if there is a problem in the script. To continue running the script and ignore errors, include the noerr parameter on the command. This permits such useful practices as using a single script to delete all the LUNs in a subsystem regardless of the total number of LUNs. Not all commands support the noerr parameter. Errors are always returned on command-syntax errors, regardless of whether you included the noerr parameter.
Diskraid error codes
