### Explanation of the Exception

The exception indicates that a child with ID 36 is being added to the widget tree, but it is marked as invisible. The specific assertion failure is located in the `semantics.dart` file at line 370, where the condition `!child.isInvisible` is expected to be true.

This issue can occur due to several reasons, such as:
- A widget being marked as invisible but still being added to the tree.
- An incorrect state or lifecycle management in your code.
- A potential bug in the Flutter framework itself.

To resolve this issue, you should:
1. Check the code where the child with ID 36 is being added to the tree.
2. Ensure that the widget is not marked as invisible when it is added.
3. If the issue persists, consider reporting it on the Flutter GitHub repository with detailed information about the context and steps to reproduce the issue.

If you need further assistance, please provide more details about the relevant parts of your code.
