User: I wanna be able to find the output text of the "deploy" script, that openshift calls automatically.
Suppose I have the following line in that "deploy" script:
python "$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR"wsgi/openshift/manage.py syncdb --noinput
Then I wanna see the output text of that call...
I already looked at the openshifthome/python/logs, and there are access* and error* logs, but there are no the ouputs that I want.
I want this because some times, after I push to the master git branch, it fails, and I wanna know where it fails...
Thanks
Assistant: The deploy output is logged to stdout if I recall correctly. If you git push from the command line you should see where things are failing.
