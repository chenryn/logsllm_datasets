Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system receiving and storing blocks of size 67108864 from various sources. The DataNode components are receiving blocks from sources, while the FSNamesystem components are updating the blockMap with the new blocks. Additionally, the DataNode components are terminating PacketResponders for the blocks.
