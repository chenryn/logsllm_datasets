Why look at NoSQL Security ?
The requirements of database 
storage systems have changed 
They become popular
● Scalability
● Redundancy
● Flexibility
● Rapid Development/Deployment
● Low Cost
● Easy to Use

NoSQL means “No Security”?
Most NoSQL services offer built-in security features
... but ...
Not enabled by default
Not trivial to configure for non-expert users 
Instance is exposed to the Internet
MISCONFIGURATIONS
Information Leakage
Data Tampering
3 | NOSQL BreakDown: A Large-scale Analysis of misconfigured NoSQL Services 
Threat Scenarios
Data Leakage
(Reading Privileges)
Ransom Demand
(Writing Privileges)
Web Resource Tampering
(Writing Privileges)

Research Goals
Large-scale analysis of the usage of NoSQL services
1. Identify unprotected instances
2. Measure the impact of the misconfigurations
3. Raise awareness on the risk of data leakage and tampering

A Word of Warning: Ethical Concerns
● We do not directly read nor transmit data, but we retrieve aggregated results
● We do not override any pre-existent content
● We contacted
■ Website/Service owners to mitigate the vulnerabilities 
■ CSPs to help secure their customers’ systems

● Gets in input the lists of IPv4 sub-networks
● Uses Nmap to scan 
● reachable IP addresses with "open" NoSQL services port
Identifies the “candidates” misconfigured instances for the security analysis

1. Tries to log into the exposed server
2. Analyzes the database’s permissions (i.e., read, write). 
a. If not possible, it evaluates (writing) permissions by 
i. Creating a new workspace/collection in the inspected database
Taking care of not overriding anything

If the exposed instance has read permissions enabled, it retrieves
● Metadata information: roles, “table” and “column” names
● Aggregated data on the presence of file objects and sensitive data
● Occurrences of elements matching the set of keywords of interest
We measure the impact of data leakage misconfigurations 
without exposing any sensitive information

It exploits the passive DNS resolution on the exposed instance IP address to 
infer if it is related to a website
It checks if the found website is reachable
