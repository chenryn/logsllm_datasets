# Leveraging Threat Intelligence Platforms to Defend Against Cyber Attacks

## Introduction
Cyber threats, including cyber espionage, hacktivism, and cybercrime, pose significant risks to state secrets, national security, business intellectual property, and personal data. Every day, new breaches, vulnerabilities, and indicators of compromise (IoCs) are disclosed, making it imperative for organizations to stay ahead of these threats.

### Key Concerns
- **State Secrets**: Political, economic, and defense information.
- **National Security**: Critical infrastructure and sensitive government data.
- **Business Intellectual Property**: Trade secrets and proprietary information.
- **Personal Data**: Customer and employee data, including personally identifiable information (PII).

### The Need for Cyber Threat Intelligence
Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) helps organizations understand the motivations, intentions, and methods of adversaries, enabling them to protect their critical assets. According to Jon Friedman et al. (2015), CTI is "knowledge about adversaries and their motivations, intentions, and methods that is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in ways that help security and business staff at all levels protect the critical assets of the enterprise."

## Available Products and Features
### Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)
A TIP supports research and tailored threat intelligence programs with three main features:
1. **Aggregation**: Combining internal and external data sources.
   - **Internal Data**: From your own attack surface.
   - **External Data**: Open-source intelligence, incident response, community, and exchange platforms.
2. **Analysis**: Managing and analyzing data to correlate incidents and campaigns.
3. **Action**: Turning information into actionable intelligence.

### Core Features of TIP
- **Data Aggregation**: Collecting data from various sources.
- **Data Management**: Structuring and prioritizing data.
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Providing timely, accurate, and relevant information.

## Case Study: New Activities of Menupass Group
In 2013, we observed an email sample targeting a Japanese victim. The sample used Poison Ivy, a popular remote access trojan (RAT). Key characteristics included:
- **Password**: keaidestone
- **ID**: 2013/05/15-40

### Findings
- **Related Samples**: Over 360 samples and 800+ IoCs.
- **Tools Used**: Poison Ivy, PlugX, Gh0st, EvilGrab, SPIVY (new).
- **Delivery Methods**: Spear-phishing emails with fabricated documents, attachments with download links, and decoy documents.
- **C2 Infrastructure**: Dynamic DNS and virtual private servers (e.g., PubYun, ChangeIP.com, No-IP, FreeDNS, Dyn.com, Oray).

## Available TIP Products
- **Commercial Solutions**: HP ArcSight, IBM QRadar, Cisco SourceFire AMP, AlienVault, CHT EyeQuila, Mandiant, Guidance EnCase, Verint XecProbe, Carbon Black, Falcon Host, iDEFENSE, Dell SecureWorks, CrowdStrike, LookingGlass.
