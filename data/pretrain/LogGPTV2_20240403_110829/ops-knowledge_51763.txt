**User:**

I am new to coding and have recently learned how to use GitHub. I have been forking various projects to my local machine in an attempt to experiment with them and learn Python. However, I encounter errors every time I try to run any of the `.py` files using Coderunner. 

Is this because Coderunner is not capable of running these programs? Or do I need to run the programs through the terminal to get them to function correctly?

**Assistant:**

Coderunner is primarily designed for testing individual Python files rather than larger, more complex projects. However, it can still be used to run such projects. In a typical project, you should look for a `setup.py` or `main.py` file, which is usually the entry point for the application.

To better assist you, could you please provide more details about the specific errors you are encountering? This information will help in diagnosing the issue and providing a more accurate solution.
