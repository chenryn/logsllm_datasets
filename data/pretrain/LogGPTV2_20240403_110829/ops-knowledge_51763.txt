User: I'm brand new to coding.  I managed to figure out how to use github and I have been forking projects over to my machine in an attempt to play around with them and learn python.  My problem is every single project I fork over, when I run any of the .py files in Coderunner it pops up with errors and doesn't run correctly.  
Is this because coderunner is not capable of running these programs?  Or do I have to run the programs through terminal to get them functioning correctly?
Assistant: Coderunner is more useful in testing single python files instead of larger projects, however it can run such projects.  A larger project should have a setup.py or a main.py which should be run.  Also, what errors are you getting?
