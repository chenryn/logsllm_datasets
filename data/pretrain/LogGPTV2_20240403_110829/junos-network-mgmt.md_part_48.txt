The SNMP community defines the relationship between an SNMP server system and the client systems.
This statement is optional.
To configure the SNMP community, include the snmp-community statement at the [edit snmp v3] hierarchy
level:
[edit snmp v3]
snmp-community community-index;
community-index is the index for the SNMP community.
To configure the SNMP community properties, include the following statements at the [edit snmp v3 snmp-
community community-index] hierarchy level:
[edit snmp v3 snmp-community community-index]
community-name community-name;
context context-name;
security-name security-name;
tag tag-name;
The following is a minimal set of sample configuration that is needed for snmp v3 snmp-community
configuration:
set snmp v3 vacm security-to-group security-model v2c security-name NOSNMPV3 group SNMPV3GROUP
set snmp v3 vacm access group SNMPV3GROUP default-context-prefix security-model any security-
level none read-view SNMPVIEW
set snmp v3 vacm access group SNMPV3GROUP default-context-prefix security-model any security-
567
level none write-view SNMPVIEW
set snmp v3 snmp-community SNMPV3COMMUNITY community-name JTACCOMMUNITY
set snmp v3 snmp-community SNMPV3COMMUNITY security-name NOSNMPV3
set snmp view SNMPVIEW oid .1 include
NOTE: The community used by the user which does not support SNMPv3, will continue to use
SNMPv2.
For more information, see the following configuration:
snmpget -v 2c -c JTACCOMMUNITY 10.52.170.100 sysUpTime.0
This section includes the following topics:
Configuring the Community Name
The community name defines the SNMP community. The SNMP community authorizes SNMPv1 or
SNMPv2c clients. The access privileges associated with the configured security name define which MIB
objects are available and the operations (read, write, or notify) allowed on those objects.
To configure the SNMP community name, include the community-name statement at the [edit snmp v3 snmp-
community community-index] hierarchy level. For more information about this statement, see community-
name.
Configuring the Context
An SNMP context defines a collection of management information that is accessible to an SNMP entity.
Typically, an SNMP entity has access to multiple contexts. A context can be a physical or logical system,
a collection of multiple systems, or even a subset of a system. Each context in a management domain
has a unique identifier.
To configure an SNMP context, include the context context-name statement at the [edit snmp v3 snmp-
community community-index] hierarchy level. For more information about this statement, see context
(SNMPv3).
NOTE: To query a routing instance or a logical system,
568
Configuring the Security Names
To assign a community string to a security name, include the security-name statement at the [edit snmp v3
snmp-community community-index] hierarchy level:
[edit snmp v3 snmp-community community-index]
security-name security-name;
security-name is used when access control is set up. The security-to-group configuration at the [edit snmp v3
vacm] hierarchy level identifies the group.
NOTE: This security name must match the security name configured at the [edit snmp v3 target-
parameters target-parameters-name parameters] hierarchy level when you configure traps.
Configuring the Tag
To configure the tag, include the tag statement at the [edit snmp v3 snmp-community community-index] hierarchy
level. For more information about this statement, see tag.

This example shows how to configure an SNMPv3 community.
Requirements
No special configuration beyond device initialization is required before configuring this example.
569
Overview
This example demonstrates how to create an SNMPv3 community. Define the SNMP community name,
specify security name to perform the access control, and define tag name which identifies the address of
managers that are allowed to use a community string. The target address defines a management
application's address and parameters that are used in sending notifications.
When the device receives a packet with a recognized community string and a tag is associated with that
packet, the Junos software looks up all the target addresses with this tag and verifies that the source
address of this packet matches one of the configured target addresses.
Specify where you want the traps to be sent and define what SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c packets are
allowed. Specify target address name that identifies the target address, define the target address, mask
range of address, port number, tag list, and target parameter.

MIB Views
IN THIS SECTION
Configure MIB Views | 573
Configure Ping Proxy MIB | 574
573
SNMPv3 defines the concept of MIB views in RFC 3415, View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). MIB views provide an agent better control over who
can access specific branches and objects within its MIB tree. A view consists of a name and a collection
of SNMP object identifiers, which are either explicitly included or excluded. Once defined, a view is then
assigned to an SNMPv3 group or SNMPv1/v2c community (or multiple communities), automatically
masking which parts of the agent’s MIB tree members of the group or community can (or cannot) access.
Configure MIB Views
By default, an SNMP community grants read access and denies write access to all supported MIB
objects (even communities configured as authorization read-write). To restrict or grant read or write access
to a set of MIB objects, you must configure a MIB view and associate the view with a community.
To configure MIB views, see view (Configuring a MIB View).
To remove an OID completely, use the delete view all oid oid-number command but omit the include
parameter.
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set view view-name oid object-identifier (include | exclude)
The following example creates a MIB view called ping-mib-view. The oid statement does not require a
dot at the beginning of the object identifier. The snmp view statement includes the branch under the
object identifier .1.3.6.1.2.1.80. This includes the entire DISMAN-PINGMIB subtree (as defined in RFC
2925, Definitions of Managed Objects for Remote Ping, Traceroute, and Lookup Operations), which
effectively permits access to any object under that branch.
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set view ping-mib-view oid 1.3.6.1.2.1.80 include
The following example adds a second branch in the same MIB view.
[edit groups global snmp]
user@host# set view ping-mib-view oid jnxPingMIB include
Assign a MIB view to a community that you want to control.
To associate MIB views with a community, see view (SNMP Community).
For more information about the Ping MIB, see RFC 2925 and PING MIB.
574
SEE ALSO
oid
Configure Ping Proxy MIB
Restrict the ping-mib community to read and write access of the Ping MIB and jnxpingMIB only. Read or
write access to any other MIB using this community is not allowed.
[edit snmp]
view ping-mib-view {
oid 1.3.6.1.2.1.80 include; #pingMIB
oid jnxPingMIB include; #jnxPingMIB
}
community ping-mib {
authorization read-write;
view ping-mib-view;
}
The following configuration prevents the no-ping-mib community from accessing Ping MIB and
jnxPingMIB objects. However, this configuration does not prevent the no-ping-mib community from
accessing any other MIB object that is supported on the device.
[edit snmp]
view no-ping-mib-view {
oid 1.3.6.1.2.1.80 exclude; # deny access to pingMIB objects
oid jnxPingMIB exclude; # deny access to jnxPingMIB objects
}
