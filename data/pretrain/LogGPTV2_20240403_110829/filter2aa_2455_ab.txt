Auto registration
• With LexisNexus or other data warehouse service, 
very easy to map a license plate to a physical address 
and owner. Think about that next time your vehicle 
comes up for renewal. (Title 18, Part I, Chapter 123, 
Section 2721 prohibits this disclosure)
• Next time you cut someone off in traffic, will they come 
looking for you? Where will they come looking for you?
• One more thought, park in a garage if possible.

Auto insurance concerns
• All states and D.C. have requirement
• Good reason not to have a car, besides cost.
• To set the correct rate, an insurer will want to 
know all about you and your car including 
where the car will be parked at night.
• Submitting false information on the insurance 
application can have bad consequences 
regarding payout of insurance policy when 
needed. Are you prepared never to make a 
claim?

Auto insurance solutions
• Can you self insure by posting a high dollar 
bond amount? Understand the financial risk 
vs. the privacy reward.
• Is the car listed owned by an LLC, can the 
LLC get insurance on the car?
• Can the driver ride someone else's policy 
where legal?
• Are cars needed full time, or can they be 
rented with insurance for short periods of 
time?

Renting wheels
• Credit card or bust. Company policies for cash rental 
often require broad reaching information from renter 
including utility bills and current pay stubs. Credit 
cards give the rental company less information but 
still… 
• Pay cash at the end of rental, won’t show on credit 
card bill. Or will it? Ask ahead of time if they pre-bill, 
some do, issuing a credit if paying by cash at the 
conclusion of the rental.
• Now companies are tracking and recording with 
“telematics” (GPS); it’s in the fine print.
