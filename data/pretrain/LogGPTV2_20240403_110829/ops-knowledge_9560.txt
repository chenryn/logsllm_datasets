User: I want to create a process that should not be listed in ps -ef command, while the process is running. I need this for testing an Intrusion detection system (IDS) application in Linux.
Assistant: It's impossible without modifying either kernel or ps itself. Simple process can't hide itself. But you can change process name by changing argv[0] and mimicry to another common process, like httpd, sshd, etc - that's what a lot of malware does.
