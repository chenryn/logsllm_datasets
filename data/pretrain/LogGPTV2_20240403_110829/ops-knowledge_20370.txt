User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:
03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, PanelView, onTrackingStopped: true 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-240.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-200.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-168.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-139.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-113.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-90.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-72.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-55.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-40.0 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateDimmedActivatedHideSensitive overlap:false 03-17 16:13:46, I, 2227, StackScrollAlgorithm, updateClipping isOverlap:false, getTopPadding=333.0, Translation=-29.0
Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of the StackScrollAlgorithm updating the clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive settings with decreasing translation values. The top padding remains constant at 333.0 and the overlap is false for each update.
