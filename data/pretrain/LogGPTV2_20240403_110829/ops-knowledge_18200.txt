User: I would like to know from you guys how you have set up your Mac terminal for python programming. I havent done anything big so far (have used ide's until now) with python in terminal but I think that you can do all kinds of fancy things (automatic fill up functions, colors, ...). Any suggestions??
Thanks you guys!
Assistant: Assuming that Python is already on your computer:
Go to /Applications folder
Then open Utilities
Double Click Terminal to open it and get a command line
type 'python' in the command prompt
Your all set!
