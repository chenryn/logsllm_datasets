User: Using windows for the first time in quite awhile and have picked up notepad++ and am using the nppexec plugin to run python scripts. However, I noticed that notepad++ doesn't pick up the directory that my script is saved in. For example, I place "script.py" in 'My Documents' however os.getcwd() prints "Program Files \ Notepad++"
Does anyone know how to change this behavior? Not exactly used to it in Mac.
Assistant: Notepad++ >nppexec >follow $(current directory)
