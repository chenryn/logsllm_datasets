Hello,

I have observed an issue with the `1.3.0-beta.1` version where the pods associated with a PetSet remain active even after the PetSet is deleted. Below are the details of the commands and their outputs:

```sh
core@master ~ $ kubectl get petsets | grep mariadb
mariadb-galera 3 3 7s

core@master ~ $ kubectl get pods | grep mariadb-galera
mariadb-galera-0 1/1 Running 0 5s
mariadb-galera-1 1/1 Running 0 4s
mariadb-galera-2 1/1 Running 0 3s

core@master ~ $ kubectl delete petset mariadb-galera
petset "mariadb-galera" deleted

core@master ~ $ kubectl get pods | grep mariadb-galera
mariadb-galera-0 1/1 Running 0 18s
mariadb-galera-1 1/1 Running 0 17s
mariadb-galera-2 1/1 Running 0 16s

core@master ~ $ kubectl get petsets | grep mariadb-galera
```

As you can see, even after deleting the PetSet `mariadb-galera`, the associated pods are still running.

Best regards,
