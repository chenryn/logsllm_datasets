Subject: Safari Unable to Establish a Secure Connection with Server

I am experiencing an issue where Safari consistently displays the following error message: "Safari cannot open the page because it cannot establish a secure connection with the server." Has anyone else encountered this problem and, if so, could you please share your experience and any solutions that may have worked for you?

It is worth noting that I am able to access the website without any issues using Firefox.

System Information:
- macOS Sierra 10.12.6

Thank you in advance for any assistance or advice.
