## Steps to Reproduce
When playing the game "Space Blast" on my iPhone 6+ for less than five minutes, the app crashes and subsequently displays a black screen, often referred to as the "black screen of death."

## Logs and Crash Reports
I would appreciate any suggestions on how to extract crash logs from my iPhone for this issue. I am accustomed to Xcode handling these tasks automatically, so I'm not sure how to proceed manually.
