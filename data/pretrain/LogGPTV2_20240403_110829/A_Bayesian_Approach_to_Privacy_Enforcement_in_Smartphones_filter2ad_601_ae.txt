A Overhead Measurement: Methodology
To complete the description in Section 5.4, we now detail
the methodology governing our overhead measurements.
The behavior of the benchmark app is governed by two
user-controlled values: (i) the length (cid:31) of the source/sink
data-ﬂow path (which is proportional to the number of
loop iterations) and (ii) the number m of values reachable
from sink arguments.
Based on our actual benchmarks, as well as data re-
ported in past studies [23], we deﬁned the ranges 1 ≤ (cid:31) ≤
19 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 13 = Σ2
n=03n. We then ran the parametric
app atop a “hybrid” conﬁguration of BAYESDROID that
simultaneously propagates tags and treats all the values
ﬂowing into a sink as relevant. For each value of (cid:31), we
executed the app 51 times, picking a value from the range
[0,2] for n uniformly at random in each of the 51 runs.
We then computed the average overhead over the runs,
excluding the ﬁrst (cold) run to remove unrelated initial-
ization costs. The stacked columns in Figure 6 each cor-
respond to a unique value of (cid:31).
B Detailed Results
Table 4 summarizes the results of the H1 experiment de-
scribed in Section 5.3. For each of the benchmarks, it
speciﬁes the number of true-positive, false-positive and
false-negative ﬁndings for the compared tools, BAYES-
DROID and TaintDroid. The benchmarks on which the
tools differ are highlighted for convenience.
Similarly, Table 5 summarizes the results of the H2 ex-
periment described in Section 5.4. The ﬁrst two columns
of Table 5 list the applications and their respective do-
main, and the third column denotes whether crawling
was exhaustive. Then, the number of crashes, true-
positive, false-positive and false-negative ﬁndings are
reported for both the H-BD and the T-BD variants of
BAYESDROID.
In Section 5.4, we describe an experiment designed to
evaluate our Bayesian analysis in “pure” form, i.e. with-
out the support of information-ﬂow tracking to detect
relevant values. To make our description of this experi-
ment complete, we include Table 5, which provides a de-
tailed summary of the results of this experiment across all
benchmarks (including ones on which no leakages were
detected). For comparability between the H-BD and T-
BD conﬁgurations, we count different dynamic reports
involving the same pair of source/sink APIs as a single
leakage instance.
