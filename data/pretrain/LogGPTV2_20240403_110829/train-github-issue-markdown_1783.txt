**macOS 10.9 - Atom 0.115.0**

I'm not certain if this issue is specific to Atom, but it is the only editor I have encountered this problem with. When working on a file, using "Cmd + Z" (undo) causes Atom to revert all changes made since the file was opened, rather than just the most recent change. This behavior is quite frustrating.
