User: If there is a large-scale distributed application that needs to be deployed, how to design the service architecture and perform load balancing?
Assistant: The following factors need to be considered in designing the service architecture: 1. Service function division: divide services according to function, such as user service, order service, payment service, etc. 2. Service communication method: choose an appropriate communication method, such as RESTful API, RPC, message queue, etc. 3. Database design: choose a suitable database, design the database table structure and index, consider the separation of reading and writing of data, sub-database and sub-table, etc. 4. Cache design: Select an appropriate cache solution according to the service access mode, such as local cache, distributed cache, etc. 5. Log collection and monitoring: Consider how to collect service logs and monitor service performance metrics. 6. Security design: Consider how to perform security verification on services, such as user authentication, access authorization, etc. When performing load balancing, the following factors need to be considered: 1. Load balancing algorithm: Select an appropriate load balancing algorithm, such as round robin, weighted round robin, random, etc. 2. Load balancer selection: Select an appropriate load balancer, such as Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB, etc. 3. Application deployment method: deploy the application on multiple servers to ensure load balancing. 4. Monitoring and automatic expansion and contraction: Consider how to monitor service load conditions and how to automatically expand and contract capacity to deal with high load conditions. 5. Database separation and read-write separation: Consider separating the database and reading-write separation to reduce the pressure on the database.
