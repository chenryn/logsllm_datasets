currently taking methotrexate and inﬂ iximab, presented to 
our institution with 6 weeks of cough, dyspnoea and fevers. 
He had failed outpatient antimicrobial therapy. Computer-
ised tomography (CT) of the chest revealed the presence of 
a lobar pneumonia and he was treated with broad spectrum 
antibiotics, which did not improve his symptoms. Bronchoal-
veolar lavage was performed with a transbronchial lung biopsy 
because of the diagnostic uncertainty of the patient's pre-
sentation. Pathology revealed non-budding yeasts, consistent 
with  Pneumocystis . Serological and urine studies were positive 
for both  Histoplasma  and  Blastomyces . The diagnosis of  Histo-
plasma  pneumonia was made because of the presentation 
being inconsistent with  Pneumocystis  pneumonia, and serol-
ogy, urine and pathology testing being more consistent with 
 Histoplasma . The patient was treated with oral itraconazole 
and was doing well at follow-up 12 weeks after hospitalisation.

  Case presentation 
 A 19-year-old male with idiopathic panuveitis diagnosed 5 years 
previously, which was initially treated with prednisone and 
then with inﬂiximab along with topical therapy, presented to 
the clinic with 6 weeks of cough, greenish sputum, left-sided 
chest pain, haemoptysis, exertional dysponea, fevers, chills and 
night sweats. His primary doctor initially treated him with 
amoxicillin-clavulanate but his symptoms persisted and he was 
referred to our institution for admission.  
  Assessment 
 At admission, the patient was febrile (38.4°C) and tachycardic 
(109 bpm). Other than bilateral scattered crackles, the physical

examination was normal. Laboratory testing showed a normal 
leukocyte count (7,100/µL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein 
(8.2 mg/L) and an elevated angiotensin converting enzyme 
(ACE) level (120 U/L; normal 8–53 U/L). 
 The patient was a college student living in a dormitory. 
He denied using recreational drugs, alcohol or tobacco. He 
had lived in Iowa for his entire life. He denied travel to a 
tuberculosis-endemic region, camping or hiking. He often 
visited a friend who had a pet dog and cat. He was not receiving 
 Pneumocystis  pneumonia prophylaxis. 
 A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the chest 
revealed consolidation in the lingula with additional bilateral 
micronodularity and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
(Fig  1 ). Broad-spectrum coverage was provided with 
vancomycin and levoﬂoxacin. An extensive diagnostic 
work-up was pursued, including serum and urine studies, 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy 
(Table  1   ). BAL cell differential revealed lymphocytosis (42%) 
with no malignant cells. Serological and urine antigen studies 
demonstrated reactivity for  Blastomyces  and  Histoplasma . The 
lung biopsy showed necrotising granulomatous inﬂammation 
with scattered, non-budding degenerative yeasts (2–4 µm), 
suggestive of  Pneumocystis  species (Fig  2 ).      
  Diagnosis 
 There was considerable diagnostic uncertainty with 
evidence for several infectious causes, including 
 Pneumocystis ,  Blastomyces  and  Histoplasma . Furthermore, 
lymphocytic alveolitis (BAL lymphocytes >20%) 
can be present in various non-infectious conditions, 
including sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 
drug-induced lung disease, pulmonary lymphomas and 
lymphoproliferative disorders. 
 The possibility of sarcoidosis was entertained, as it would 
explain the panuveitis, and may also be manifesting in the 
lungs. Further, sarcoid-like granulomatous reactions have 
been reported with inﬂiximab and other anti-tumour necrosis 
factor agents.  1   Although granulomatous inﬂammation was 
seen on biopsy, the presence of fungal elements suggested 
infection. Lobar consolidation is unusual for sarcoidosis, 
which usually presents as hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy 
and/or multiple nodules in a perilymphatic distribution. ACE 
elevation lacks speciﬁcity as it can also be seen in fungal or

Consolidation is noted in the lingula 
of the left upper lobe on lung (A) and 
mediastinal (B) windows. Parenchymal 
micronodularity is present bilaterally 
(A and C) and hilar and mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy is seen in B and D .  
mycobacterial infection, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and other 
conditions. 
ﬁndings suggesting  Pneumocystis  were challenging to interpret 
in the context of negative PCR results for this organism. 
 The differential diagnosis was narrowed to the three most 
likely fungal infections, namely  Pneumocystis  pneumonia, 
blastomycosis and histoplasmosis. While imaging can raise 
suspicion for  Pneumocystis  infection, the diagnosis is conﬁrmed 
by analysing sputum, BAL or histology.  Pneumocystis  
pneumonia can produce a variety of radiographic appearances, 
including patchy upper-lobe-predominant ground glass 
opacities, and cystic lesions;  2,3   but lobar consolidation is 
unusual. In non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients, 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has excellent sensitivity and 
negative predictive value from induced sputum (100%; 100%) 
and BAL (84%; 98.3%) samples.  4   However, the histologic 
 On histology,  Pneumocystis jirovecii  shares many morphologic 
similarities with  Histoplasma capsulatum . Both are thin-walled 
yeasts measuring 2–8 µm in size, appearing collapsed or distorted 
in tissue sections.  Pneumocystis  often exhibits two larger 
intracystic bodies on silver stain and lacks budding forms. In 
contrast,  Histoplasma  has a smaller capsular dot and multiplies by 
budding.  5   When present, budding forms can suggest  Histoplasma ; 
however, their absence does not exclude this possibility.  5   
 In this case, the yeasts did not show budding, a capsular dot 
or intracystic bodies. Although granulomatous inﬂammation 
is atypical for  Pneumocystis , it has been reported in 4–5% of 
patients.  5   Unfortunately, the degenerative nature of yeast forms,
