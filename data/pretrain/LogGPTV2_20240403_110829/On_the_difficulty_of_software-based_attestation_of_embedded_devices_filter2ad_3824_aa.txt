**Case Presentation:**
A 19-year-old male with a history of idiopathic panuveitis, currently on methotrexate and infliximab, presented to our institution with a 6-week history of cough, dyspnea, and fevers. He had failed outpatient antimicrobial therapy. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed lobar pneumonia, and he was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which did not improve his symptoms.

**Assessment:**
At admission, the patient was febrile (38.4°C) and tachycardic (109 bpm). Physical examination revealed bilateral scattered crackles. Laboratory tests showed a normal leukocyte count (7,100/µL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein (8.2 mg/L), and an elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level (120 U/L; normal 8–53 U/L).

The patient was a college student living in a dormitory. He denied using recreational drugs, alcohol, or tobacco and had lived in Iowa his entire life. He denied travel to tuberculosis-endemic regions, camping, or hiking but often visited a friend who had a pet dog and cat. He was not receiving Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis.

A CT scan of the chest revealed consolidation in the lingula with additional bilateral micronodularity and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Broad-spectrum coverage was provided with vancomycin and levofloxacin. An extensive diagnostic work-up was pursued, including serum and urine studies, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and transbronchial lung biopsy (Table 1). BAL cell differential revealed lymphocytosis (42%) with no malignant cells. Serological and urine antigen studies demonstrated reactivity for Blastomyces and Histoplasma. The lung biopsy showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with scattered, non-budding degenerative yeasts (2–4 µm), suggestive of Pneumocystis species (Fig. 2).

**Diagnosis:**
There was considerable diagnostic uncertainty with evidence for several infectious causes, including Pneumocystis, Blastomyces, and Histoplasma. Lymphocytic alveolitis (BAL lymphocytes >20%) can be present in various non-infectious conditions, such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced lung disease, pulmonary lymphomas, and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Sarcoidosis was considered due to the patient's history of panuveitis and the presence of granulomatous inflammation. However, the presence of fungal elements suggested an infection. Lobar consolidation is unusual for sarcoidosis, which typically presents with hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy and/or multiple nodules in a perilymphatic distribution. ACE elevation lacks specificity as it can also be seen in fungal or mycobacterial infections, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and other conditions.

The findings suggesting Pneumocystis were challenging to interpret in the context of negative PCR results for this organism. The differential diagnosis was narrowed to three likely fungal infections: Pneumocystis pneumonia, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis.

**Histopathology:**
On histology, Pneumocystis jirovecii shares many morphologic similarities with Histoplasma capsulatum. Both are thin-walled yeasts measuring 2–8 µm in size, appearing collapsed or distorted in tissue sections. Pneumocystis often exhibits two larger intracystic bodies on silver stain and lacks budding forms, while Histoplasma has a smaller capsular dot and multiplies by budding. In this case, the yeasts did not show budding, a capsular dot, or intracystic bodies. Although granulomatous inflammation is atypical for Pneumocystis, it has been reported in 4–5% of patients.

**Conclusion:**
The diagnosis of Histoplasma pneumonia was made based on the clinical presentation and serological, urine, and pathology testing. The patient was treated with oral itraconazole and was doing well at follow-up 12 weeks after hospitalization.
