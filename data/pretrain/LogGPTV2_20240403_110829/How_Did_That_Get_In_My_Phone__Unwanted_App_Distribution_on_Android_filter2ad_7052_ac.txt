Section V-C describes the most common families in our
dataset, and Section V-B details the top signers behind the
unwanted apps.
Comparison with prior work. Shen et al [67] measured the
fraction of devices with an AV detection over 6M Android
devices in April 2015. Those detections belonged to ﬁve
categories: trojan, infostealer, backdoor, hacktool, spyware.
Unfortunately, they only provide the fraction of rooted and
non-rooted devices with at least one detection of each category.
Each number is in the range 0.10%–0.71%, but we cannot infer
the total prevalence, making the comparison difﬁcult. Still,
our 10%–24% prevalence range seems signiﬁcantly higher.
This is likely due to our measurement including also PUP
and covering four months. In addition, the last four years
may have seen an increase in unwanted apps as Android
became the dominant OS in user devices. We also examined
recent threat reports from security vendors [7], [12]. However,
those reports do not measure prevalence on devices, but rather
number of detections and number of new samples discovered,
which cannot be accurately compared. Other works have
measured malware and PUP prevalence on Windows enterprise
hosts [46], [79]. Some works [46] operated on a very different
time period (three years versus four months in our study),
making it difﬁcult to compare prevalence estimates. However,
Yen et al. [79] observed that 15% of hosts in a large enterprise
encountered at least one detection by a speciﬁc AV engine
over a four-month period in 2014. Yen et al. call the ﬂagged
samples malware, but the authors conﬁrmed us they included
all detections by the AV client. That prevalence falls in
our 10%-24% range, also computed on a four-month period
although in mid-2019, and is slightly lower than the 18.3%
prevalence with the selected threshold.
Takeaway. Even the very conservative estimate of 18.3%
indicates that Android devices have an unwanted app preva-
lence rate similar and possibly slightly higher than Windows
(enterprise) hosts. Thus, despite many security improvements
provided by the Android ecosystem (e.g., OS app isolation,
OS permission model, ofﬁcial market) the security posture of
Android devices with respect to unwanted apps does not seem
better than that of Windows (enterprise) hosts.
In the remainder of the paper, unwanted apps refers to the
3M APKs at t=4, i.e., ﬂagged by at least 4 AV engines.
B. Unwanted App Signers
We use the certiﬁcate’s public key hash to identify the
signer, i.e., the entity that signs an APK. For each of the
4.1M signers in the full reputation logs, we compute the signer
detection ratio (SDR), i.e., the fraction of unwanted APKs it
signs over the total number of APKs it signs. The SDR allows
to identify signers with a signiﬁcant fraction of unwanted
APKs. The distribution is bimodal, 86% of the signers have
0% SDR and 13% have 100% SDR, with only 1% in between.
We consider a signer unwanted if it has SDR ≥ 4% and signs
at least 100 unwanted APKs. We experimentally chose these
thresholds to minimize ﬂagging signers with a small number
of APKs compromised in a short time period (e.g., using an
abusive SDK in some versions), who later on addressed the
issue. Using these thresholds, we ﬂag 146 (0.003%) of all
signers as unwanted, with only 70 of those being present in
over 1K devices.
Table V shows the top 10 unwanted signers by device
prevalence. For each signer, the table shows ranking; certiﬁcate
thumbprint; a name that corresponds to a well known key
or a distinguishing substring of the certiﬁcate’s Subject DN;
number of devices where APKs from the signer are installed,
number of distinct package names of APKs signed by the
signer, number of APKs signed by the signer, number of
unwanted APKs among those, and SDR.
Six of the 10 signers correspond to generic certiﬁcates that
sign apps from multiple developers. Ranks 1 and 3 correspond
to default AOSP keys. Signing an APK with an AOSP key is
a well known security issue since the private keys are known
and any other apps signed with the same key could perform an
update. There are 1.83M (1.5%) devices with APKs signed by
any of the AOSP keys. Since the Play market does not allow
apps signed with these keys to be uploaded, these apps must
have been installed from alternative sources. APKs signed with
these keys include popular package names such as MineCraft
and WhatsApp, indicating impersonation of benign apps by
unwanted app developers. Using the AOSP keys facilitates
the unwanted app developers to hide among the crowd of
other developers also using them. Prior work has observed
the use of AOSP keys in custom ﬁrmware images [80], [82].
Our work differs in reporting their abuse and the fraction of
devices affected by them. At rank 8 there is an Android Debug
certiﬁcate, used by Android Studio to sign applications during
debugging. Similar to the AOSP certiﬁcates, such certiﬁcates
should not be used outside debugging, and applications using
them cannot be uploaded to the Play market.
Generic certiﬁcates at ranks 2, 5, and 10 correspond to the
SeattleCloud [62], AppsGeyser [19], and WordPress2Apk [78]
online app generators (OAGs), respectively. OAGs automate
app development,
lowering the technical skill required by
app developers, and may offer publishing the produced apps
to the Play market [55]. Our results indicate OAGs publish
unwanted apps from their clients, possibly due to limited
vetting of the apps they (are paid to) publish. Identifying such
generic certiﬁcates is fundamental to avoid false positives in
detection systems that leverage signer reputation, as well as
when attributing apps to their owners [64].
The remaining four signers correspond to speciﬁc unwanted
app developers. Both 1Mobile and Netdragon do not have
any apps in the Play market. 1Mobile publishes an alter-
native market of the same name. The 1Mobile market app
(me.onemobile.android) has 17,466 APKs, an unusually high
number of versions possibly indicating polymorphism to by-
pass detection. NetDragon sold part of its business to Baidu
in July 2013 [28]. We believe the reason why NetDragon
appears in the list is the 2015 discovery of a backdoor in
Baidu’s MoPlus SDK [66]. Both Outﬁt7 and iMobLife have
multiple apps in the Play market. Surprisingly, iMobLife uses

a large number of Play developer accounts to distribute their
performance optimization and mindfulness apps. The accounts
include iMobLife Inc.; AIO Software Technology CO., Ltd.;
Daily Yoga Culture Technology Co., Ltd; HK SMARTER MOBI
TECHNOLOGY CO.,LIMITED; SM Health Team; and The
Unexplainable Store®.
Takeaway. In addition to APK polymorphism, unwanted app
developers also leverage developer account polymorphism,
which provides isolation between apps in different accounts. In
this way, even if some of the apps are removed by the market,
others could remain available. We observe AOSP keys being
abused to sign unwanted apps and being present in 1.83M
devices. Moreover, we also observe online app generators
being abused to generate and publish unwanted apps.
C. Family Classiﬁcation
To understand the most prevalent threats affecting Android
devices, we classify the unwanted APKs into families. For
this, we feed the AV labels from the 4.6M VT reports to
the AVClass malware labeling tool [63]. AVClass outputs the
most likely family name for each sample and also classiﬁes
