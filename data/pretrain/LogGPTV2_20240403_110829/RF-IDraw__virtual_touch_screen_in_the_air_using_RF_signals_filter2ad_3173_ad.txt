as measured by the infrared VICON motion capture system. (b) and (c) show two trajectories reconstructed by RF-IDraw, starting from two
candidate initial positions provided by the multi-resolution positioning algorithm. Both reproduce all the detailed turns in the trajectory shape
and can be recognized as the correct word. Based on the overall trajectory votes in (f), RF-IDraw chooses the blue one as its ﬁnal output,
which is indeed closer to the ground truth position, as shown in (d), demonstrating RF-IDraw’s capability to reﬁne positioning through
trajectory tracing. Finally, (e) shows the comparison between the actual trajectory and RF-IDraw’s output after removing the initial offset.
The similarity between the two curves proves the unique shape resilience property of RF-IDraw’s trajectory tracing.
7.3 Shape Resilience
Finally, these ﬁgures also demonstrate the unique property of RF-
IDraw’s trajectory tracing design, which is that, the shape will be
well preserved in the reconstructed trajectory, even if the initial po-
sition estimate has an offset.
Let us ﬁrst look at the comparison between the blue reconstructed
trajectory and the ground truth. The blue initial position is about
7 cm away from the ground truth initial position.4 In Fig. 10(e),
we show the blue reconstructed trajectory after removing this 7 cm
initial position offset from it. As we can see, this shifted version
of the reconstructed trajectory closely matches the ground truth,
accurately preserving the shape of the writing. Furthermore, even
in the red reconstructed trajectory, whose initial position is off by
41 cm, the shape of the word is still roughly preserved.
As §4 explains, shape ﬁdelity can be achieved despite initial po-
sition offset because all grating lobes of an antenna pair rotate to-
gether, and hence picking a wrong grating lobe’s rotation to track
only results in a transform of the trajectory. Furthermore, if the grat-
ing lobe picked is fairly close to the correct one, the reconstructed
shape will be very similar to the correct shape, and the distortion
in shape increases as we pick a grating lobe further away from the
correct one. Indeed, as compared with the blue reconstructed tra-
jectory, the red one is less similar to the green ground truth’s shape,
because its initial position is off by more.
4Our further analysis reveals that, given the phase difference mea-
surements, the grating lobes intersecting at the blue initial position
are indeed the ones closest to the ground truth initial position as
well. In other words, the initial positioning error is due to the error
in the measurements of the signal phases, which are likely caused
by random wireless noise and the multipath effect [22, 35].
This demonstrates the shape resilience property of RF-IDraw’s
trajectory tracing, while also underscoring the value of ﬁnding an
initial position reasonably close to the correct one. This property
can be particularly useful in applications where recognizing the tra-
jectory of a motion offers high value. In this trace, in fact all three
trajectories in Fig. 10(d) have been correctly identiﬁed as the word
"clear" by the handwriting recognition app RF-IDraw interfaces
with. In §9, we validate the robustness of RF-IDraw’s trajectory
tracing through the evaluation of character and word recognition
success rates.
8. EVALUATION
We evaluate our prototype of RF-IDraw by having ﬁve users
write 150 words randomly sampled from the 5000 most frequently
used words in the Corpus of Contemporary American English [6].
The users write in the air with a UHF RFID on their hands as shown
in Fig. 1(a). The average width of each letter written is around
10 cm. We conduct experiments in both LOS and NLOS settings,
in the 5×6 m2 VICON room as well as a large ofﬁce lounge of size
8×12 m2 divided into cubicles.
We compare the performance of RF-IDraw with state-of-the-art
antenna array based approach [12] using the same number of an-
tennas. Both RF-IDraw and the antenna array based system employ
8 antennas connected to two RFID readers. The details of the an-
tenna setup for both schemes are described in §6. The users stand
2–5 meters away from the reader antennas in our experiments.5 RF-
5The commercial RFID reader’s range limits the range of our cur-
rent prototype. Beyond 5 meters, we start to see signiﬁcant message
loss because the RFID cannot harvest enough energy to wake up.

Trajectory Error (cm)
(a) CDF of Trajectory Error Distance in LOS
(b) CDF of Trajectory Error Distance in NLOS
Figure 11—CDF of Trajectory Error Distance in LOS and NLOS: The median point-by-point error distance for RF-IDraw’s reconstructed
trajectory after removing the initial offset is 3.7 cm and 4.9 cm in LOS and NLOS respectively, 11× and 16× lower than the median errors
(after removing the offset) for the antenna array based scheme in LOS and NLOS, signiﬁcantly improving the accuracy of trajectory tracing.
Furthermore, the errors for RF-IDraw are due to the coherent stretching and squeezing of the trajectory shape, rather than being random.
Hence, despite this error, RF-IDraw’s reconstructed trajectories of letters a few centimeters wide can still be successfully recognized in
97.5% of the cases by a handwriting recognition app, as we show in §9.1.
IDraw uses the multi-resolution positioning and trajectory tracing
algorithms described in §5 to reconstruct the trajectory and estimate
the initial position of the RFID. In the antenna array based system,
each 4-antenna array measures an angle of arrival of the RFID, then
the beams of the arrays are intersected to estimate the RFID posi-
tion for each point on the trajectory, reproducing the trajectory.
In this section, we focus on analyzing the trajectory tracing and
positioning accuracy of RF-IDraw and the antenna array based
scheme. In §9, we further assess the capabilities of the two systems
in the virtual touch screen application.
8.1 Trajectory Accuracy
Let us start by evaluating the accuracy of the two systems in re-
constructing the RFID trajectory.
Metric: To focus on how much the reconstructed trajectory shape
deviates from the actual trajectory shape, we remove a ﬁxed off-
set between the reconstructed and the ground truth trajectories. The
trajectory error for RF-IDraw is computed by removing the initial
position offset from its reconstructed trajectory, and calculating the
point-by-point position difference between its shifted reconstructed
trajectory and the ground truth. For example, the trajectory error
for the reconstructed trajectory in Fig. 10(b) would be the point-
by-point differences between the two curves in Fig. 10(e). For the
antenna array based scheme, since the errors along the trajectory
are random and independent from each other, removing the initial
position offset results in even larger error distances for other points
on the trajectory. Hence, instead we compute the average position
difference (a vector in space) between the reconstructed trajectory
and the ground truth. We remove this average position difference
from the reconstructed trajectory, then calculate the point-by-point
differences between the shifted reconstructed trajectory and the
ground truth. Note that, removing the average position difference
essentially removes the DC offset and thus is favorable to the com-
pared scheme.
Trajectory Accuracy Results in LOS: Fig. 11(a) shows the CDF
of the trajectory errors for the two systems in LOS. The median
error for RF-IDraw is 3.7 cm (point-by-point difference) and the
90th percentile is 9.7 cm. For the antenna array based system using
the same number of antennas, the median error is 40.8 cm and the
90th percentile is 121.1 cm. Hence, RF-IDraw’s trajectory tracing
is 11× more accurate than the antenna array approach in LOS.
As RFID manufacturers compete to increase the range, it is con-
stantly growing and we expect RF-IDraw to beneﬁt from that trend.
• Note that, the 3.7 cm accuracy does not fully capture the capabil-
ity of RF-IDraw’s trajectory tracing. Speciﬁcally, despite this er-
ror, RF-IDraw’s reconstructed trajectory of letters a few centime-
ters wide can still be successfully recognized by a simple hand-
writing recognition app in 97.5% of the cases, as we evaluate
in the virtual touch screen application in §9. This is because the
point-by-point errors along RF-IDraw’s reconstructed trajectory
are not independent random errors. Instead, they have a structure
and reﬂect coherent stretching, squeezing, and enlarging in the
trajectory shape. Thus, although the trajectory error as deﬁned
here is a few centimeters, in most cases, the distortion does not
affect the recognition of the letter or word (e.g., Fig. 10(c)).
• RF-IDraw’s 11× trajectory accuracy improvement over the an-
tenna array based scheme is enabled by mainly two levers. First,
the high-resolution and robustness to noise features of grating
lobes allow RF-IDraw to trace the details of the RFID trajectory.
Second, RF-IDraw’s trajectory tracing algorithm tracks the con-
tinuous rotation of the grating lobes, resulting in shape resilience.
• Using the same number of antennas as RF-IDraw, the standard
antenna arrays will have much wider beams which fail to provide
the resolution or robustness needed to track the shape of a word
written by a user in the air. Also, as opposed to the coherent
deviations on RF-IDraw’s trajectory, the errors the antenna array
based scheme has are random and scattered all over the place,
resulting in completely unrecognizable trajectories as §9 reveals.
Trajectory Accuracy Results in NLOS: We also evaluate the two
systems’ performance in non-line-of-sight experiments. The NLOS
setup is in an ofﬁce lounge area (8×12 m2) divided into cubicles by
2.5 m tall, 20 cm thick separators made of two layers of wood. The
reader setup is deployed behind these separators and we ensure that
there is no LOS path from any of the reader antennas to the RFID
on the user’s hand. Similar to the literature on RFIDs [39, 37, 22,
12], we cannot do cross-room evaluation because the RFID reader
cannot power an RFID from a different room.
Fig. 11(b) shows the trajectory error for both RF-IDraw and the
antenna array based solution in NLOS. The median error of RF-
IDraw is 4.9 cm and the 90th percentile is 13.6 cm, similar to LOS.
In comparison, the antenna array based system’s median trajectory
error in NLOS is 76.9 cm and the 90th percentile is 166.7 cm.
• The degradation in trajectory accuracy caused by NLOS is more
severe for the antenna array based scheme (40.8 cm in LOS
v.s. 76.9 cm in NLOS) than for RF-IDraw (3.7 cm in LOS v.s.
4.9 cm in NLOS)). This is likely due to the different effects mul-
tipath [22, 35] has on the two methods. In NLOS, the direct path

in LOS and NLOS respectively, 2.2× and 2.3× lower than the median initial position error for the antenna array based scheme in LOS and

is attenuated and the dominant path may differ from the direct
path. In this case, estimating the absolute position becomes chal-
lenging, as past work has shown [19, 39, 41]. As a result, the
antenna arrays’ performance signiﬁcantly worsens. Yet the tra-
jectory shape of RF-IDraw is more robust, because as long as
there is a dominant path, the shape will still be discovered by
following the dominant path.
In conclusion, RF-IDraw enables accurate trajectory tracing in
both LOS and NLOS, outperforming the antenna array based tech-
nique using the same number of antennas by 11× and 16× in LOS
and NLOS respectively. Note that, while several past RF localiza-
tion techniques have also achieved centimeter scale accuracy [41,
39, 9], they either require a dense deployment of reference sources
and/or a large number of antennas, or GHz of bandwidth. In con-
trast, RF-IDraw shows that, for the ﬁrst time, one can trace the tra-
jectory shape of an RF source with centimeter accuracy with a small
number of antennas, without reference sources, and using commer-
cial narrowband devices.
8.2
Initial Position Accuracy
Next, we evaluate the initial position estimation accuracy. Fig. 12
shows the CDF for initial position error for RF-IDraw and the an-
tenna array based system. In LOS, the median initial position error
of the antenna array based system is 42 cm and its 90th percentile
is 148 cm; RF-IDraw’s median initial position error is 19 cm, 2.2×
better than AoA, and its 90th percentile is 38 cm, 3.9× better than
AoA. In NLOS, the accuracy for both systems degrades, because
of the attenuation of the direct path from the reader antennas to the
RFID as well as the multipath caused by structures in the ofﬁce
lounge. The median initial position error for RF-IDraw in NLOS
is 32 cm and the 90th percentile is 47 cm. For the antenna array
based scheme, the median and 90th percentile accuracy is 74 cm
and 183 cm respectively.
• It is worth noting that, the initial position accuracy for the an-
tenna array based scheme is similar to its trajectory accuracy dis-
cussed in the previous section. This is because the antenna array
based system estimates each position along the trajectory inde-
pendently using the same method as it estimates the initial po-
sition. Therefore, the errors along the trajectory are random and
independent from each other, and hence the trajectory error will
be similar to the absolute position error.
• Using the same number of antennas, in both LOS and NLOS, RF-
IDraw improves the initial position accuracy over the antenna
array based technique by over 2.2×. This improvement stems
from the fact that the overall trajectory vote is used to identify
the best initial position, which reﬁnes RF-IDraw’s accuracy, as
shown in §7.2.

Initial Position Estimate Error (m)
Figure 13—Initial Position Accuracy v.s. Trajectory Accuracy
in RF-IDraw: When the initial position picked by RF-IDraw is
within 40 cm of the actual initial position, this initial offset has
minimal effect on the trajectory accuracy, due to the similarity be-
tween closeby grating lobes. If the initial position has a fairly large
offset, the trajectory reconstructed will be more distorted, resulting
in a higher trajectory error. Yet this higher error is mainly due to
the enlarging of certain parts in the trajectory, and hence does not
translate into high recognition error (e.g., red curve in Fig. 10(d)).
8.3 The Effect of Initial Position Accuracy on Trajec-
tory Accuracy in RF-IDraw
As we have demonstrated through the microbenchmark experi-
ment in §7, even when the initial position estimate has some offset,
the shape of RF-IDraw’s reconstructed trajectory is still preserved.
Here let us further analyze the relationship between the trajectory
accuracy and the initial position accuracy of RF-IDraw. Speciﬁ-
cally, for each word written, we remove the initial position offset
from RF-IDraw’s reconstructed trajectory, then compute the me-
dian error for all the positions throughout the trajectory. Then we
group the traces according to their initial position error, and study
the trajectory error for each initial position error range.
Fig. 13 shows the trajectory error as a function of the initial po-
sition error.
• When the initial position error is below 40 cm, RF-IDraw’s tra-
jectory accuracy almost remains the same, i.e., around 3 cm.
Hence, a reasonably small initial position offset does not affect
the shape resilience of RF-IDraw.
• When the initial offset is fairly large, the trajectory error also
increases, to a median of around 7–8 cm. To understand why
