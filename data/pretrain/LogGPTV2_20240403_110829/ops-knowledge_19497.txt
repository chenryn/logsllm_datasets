Question: You are conducting a security audit on a web application and notice that it uses a server-side templating engine to render pages. You suspect that the application might be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). Which of the following payloads would you use to test for SSTI?
"A": "{{7*'7'}} which should render '7777777' if vulnerable.",
"B": "<script>alert('XSS')</script> which should trigger a JavaScript alert if vulnerable.",
"C": "' OR '1'='1' -- which should bypass authentication if SQL injection is possible.",
"D": "system('id') which should execute a command if command injection is possible."
Answer: A
