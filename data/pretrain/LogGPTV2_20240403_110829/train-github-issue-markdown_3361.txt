When a parent give a constraint to his childrens by annotations,  
whe cannot remove the constraint by annotation in the class child
It's possible to had a way to manage inheritance strategy like this ? :
    /** 
     * @assert:NotBlank()
     * @assert:NotInheritance()
     */
or/and do this :  
$childObject->getValidator()->removeConstraint('name');
