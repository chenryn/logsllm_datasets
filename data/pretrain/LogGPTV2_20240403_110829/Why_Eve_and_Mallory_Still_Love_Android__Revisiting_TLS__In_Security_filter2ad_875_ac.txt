### Impact on Android Applications

Our analysis revealed that 4,804 applications targeting various Android versions had minimal impact. Out of the 89,686 apps examined, a significant number were found to be insecure, while others were secure. The findings are summarized as follows:

- **Insecure**: False
- **Secure**: True
- **System User**: False
- **Always**: True
- **Duration**: >10 days
- **Android Version**: a = Android 9
- **Scope**: Global and Domain-Specific
- **Total**: Element in elements.

### Certificate Pinning Adoption

Overall, we identified 663 applications that implemented certificate pinning using Network Security Configuration (NSC). These apps used 1,121 distinct pins for 2,781 unique domains, of which 998 were valid. The finance category was the most common for implementing pinning (6%). This aligns with the frequently pinned domains listed in Table 9, primarily associated with banking or mobile money applications.

### Pinned Certificates Analysis

Our certificate analysis showed that 483 leaf certificates, 542 intermediate CA certificates, and 289 root CA certificates were pinned. Table 7 in the appendix provides an overview of the most popular CA certificates. The majority of pinned CA certificates affected pre-installed system CAs. We extracted child tags and compared them with the certificates from fetched certificate chains.

### HTTPS Downgrades

We found valid HTTPS connections for 8,935 applications and argued that downgrading safe defaults was unnecessary. Table 8 in the appendix lists the most frequent domains where downgrades occurred. Interestingly, the top domain values, `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, appeared to have no security impact. However, these might result from copy & paste from Facebookâ€™s cache proxy library or debugging configurations used for testing.

### NSC Settings in Apps

The distribution of features analyzed across app categories and download counts is shown in Figure 3. The table below summarizes the NSC settings across different app categories and download ranges.

### Root CA Pinning Detection

To detect root CA pinning, we matched against pins generated from the default Android system trust. For 778 pinned domains, we collected and analyzed the complete certificate chain. Some certificate chains could not be downloaded due to connection issues or malformed domain names.

### Backup Pins

The official Android documentation recommends using backup pins. We found 566 apps that set a backup pin, but 47 of these were non-functional, such as empty strings. We discuss these cases in Section 4.1.6. For semantically correct pinning configurations, we identified possible misconceptions. For example, the Android (Studio) LINT feature suggests registering two pins instead of one but does not check for pin correctness or equality. We detected identical or non-functional backup pins, such as sequences like 'AAAAAA...' or 'BBBBBB...', or instances where only a single character was changed. This may address the LINT warning but does not enhance security. Additionally, at least 12 applications used the empty pin hash produced by hashing an empty string encoded as Base64, likely due to tool misuse or lack of knowledge.

### Pinning Expiration

The Android documentation suggests setting a pinning expiration date. After this date, pinning is no longer enforced. We found 130 apps that set a pinning expiration parameter, with a mean expiration value of 947 days. Most apps had an expiration value that did not negatively impact pinning security.

### Custom CA Configurations

We checked for `<trust-anchors>` and `<pin-set>` elements to identify modifications to the list of trusted root CAs. We found custom CA configurations in 38,628 apps (37,562 globally, 1,781 for domains). 759 apps distrusted all pre-installed CAs and added their own set of custom CA certificates (30 globally, 744 for domains). Furthermore, 123 apps restricted the list of pre-installed system CAs (14 globally, 112 for domains). We also found 836 apps that added supplementary certificates (784 globally, 58 for domains). Table 12 in the appendix provides an overview of all added certificates and the most frequent custom CA certificates used in production.

### User-Installed Certificates

We checked if the `src` property of the nested `<trust-anchors>` element was set to `user`, enabling trust for user-installed CA certificates. Compared to Android 7 default settings, enabling user-installed CA certificates is a security downgrade. Out of 1,098,479 apps targeting Android 7 or higher, we found 8,606 apps that re-enable trust for user-installed certificates (8.67%) (8,001 globally, 707 for domains). This issue was more common in popular apps, particularly in the categories of Art & Design (28%), Books & Reference (16%), Comics (27%), and Personalization (22%).

### Debug Overrides

We analyzed how app developers configured debugging settings. The use of `<debug-overrides>` is a recommended security best practice, as it cannot be used in production code and apps with enabled debug flags cannot be published in Google Play. Overall, we found 10,085 apps with `<debug-overrides>`. Debug overrides were most popular among travel & local (46%) and event apps (30%), and generally among apps with higher download counts of 10,000,000 or more (21-33%). We analyzed their `<trust-anchors>` child elements for specific configurations of trusted roots, including user-installed certificates or bundled custom certificates. We found 318 apps that register custom certificates in `<debug-overrides>` (cf. Table 11 in the appendix). We detected 170 certificates of MitM tools, and 9,904 apps allowed user-installed certificates in `<debug-overrides>`.

### Misuse of Debug Overrides

Unfortunately, we also found several configurations outside the `<debug-overrides>` environment that we could unambiguously attribute to debugging purposes. 41 apps in our set used custom CA configurations to use MitM certificates for debugging TLS connections. This was identified by observing the CA certificates' subject CN, where popular MitM proxy tools include the term "proxy." For example, the Charles Proxy MitM proxy tool was the most popular and included the substring "Charles Proxy Custom Root Certificate." Contrary to `<debug-overrides>` configurations, these are used in production code and can pose a security threat. The Android documentation discourages their use.

### Malformed NSC Files

We investigated faulty NSC files, distinguishing between syntax errors and ambiguous security settings. In 1,310 apps, we found `<domain-config>` configurations that contained URLs instead of hostnames, such as `http://example.com/` or `http://example.com/index.php` instead of `example.com`. During app execution, such configurations are ignored, making the `<domain-config>` setting ineffective. We also identified 42 similar cases where developers used string resources (e.g., `@string/host`) instead of hostnames. In 210 configurations, we found wildcard domain specifications (e.g., `*.example.com`), which are non-functional and make the configurations ineffective.
