Mining with consent There are two mining applications
focused on mining solely with visitor consent. JSEcoin, a
mining service presenting itself as “The future blockchain
& ecosystem for ecommerce and digital advertising”, allows
website owners to let their users mine JSE tokens, after ex-
plicit opt-in consent [20]. Another consent-focused mining
application is AuthedMine, the opt-in version of Coinhive,
introduced after adblockers started blocking Coinhive [8]. In
our crawl, we have identiﬁed 2,477 websites using the JSE-
coin miner and 227 websites using AuthedMine. None of
the websites using AuthedMine opened a WebSocket con-
nection, which indicates that no mining activity took place.
143 websites using JSEcoin did however open a WebSocket
connection, but never actually started mining. By analyzing
the WebSocket trafﬁc, we observed that in most cases the
WebSocket connection initiation was followed by two probes
sent back and forth, waiting for the user to opt-in. Since these
mining applications did not started mining without consent
of the visitor, we have omitted them from our results.
Figure 2: Venn-diagram showing the distribution of identiﬁed
cryptojacking domains over the used top lists
Identiﬁed domains in top lists Of the 10,100 domains
identiﬁed as actively cryptojacking, only 925 were found
in one of the three top lists. The Alexa Top 1M contains the
most cryptojacking domains (648), meaning that 0.065% of
the websites in the Alexa Top 1M are cryptojacking, slightly
less than previous work [22,41]. For both other lists this num-
ber is lower. The addition of the Cisco Umbrella 1M resulted
in only 27 additional ﬁndings, whereas the addition of the
Majestic 1M led to the discovery of 397 new cryptojacking
domains. In Figure 2, a Venn diagram depicts these differ-
ences in subsets. Only a small number of websites is shared
among the Alexa Top 1M and the Majestic 1M. Also note that
9,175 (86%) of the identiﬁed websites are not listed in any of
these top lists. This ﬁnding stresses the necessity of looking
further than top lists while performing campaign analysis and
to study the current state of cryptojacking on the Internet.
Categorization of websites We have discovered various
sorts of cryptojacking websites on the Internet. By comple-
menting the list of identiﬁed domains with website catego-
rization data of Webshrinker [51], we categorized each cryp-
tojacking website. We conﬁrm previous work by identifying
adult content (such as pornography) as the most prevailing
category within our dataset, with over 2,000 websites in this
category. Illegal content, a category known being home to abu-
sive web resources, contains a lower number of cryptojacking
websites compared to what we expected.
Installation base Coinhive is still the most popular crypto-
mining application installed on the identiﬁed cryptojacking
websites (75%), followed by Cryptoloot (5.3%) and CoinImp
(3.2%). But, there are noticeable differences between the com-
plete crawl and the subset of domains in the Alexa Top 1M.
Coinhive’s share is halved, whereas CoinImp and Cryptoloot
installations are doubled in size. Nerohut and Webminerpool
miners are relatively more present in the Alexa Top 1M subset,
while Mineralt has a similar share in that subset. The bottom

Mining pool participation Most mining applications do
not disclose the actual mining pool they are mining for in
WebSocket trafﬁc. However, on 135 identiﬁed domains, the
WebSocket trafﬁc did reveal that, as listed in Table 4. Most
of these websites are participating in the supportxmr.com
mining pool, which is commonly orchestrated by a Webminer-
pool or Nerohut mining script. Other pools are less commonly
used or were not revealed in WebSocket trafﬁc.
Throttling of applications Most cryptomining applica-
tions allow for a throttle value to be set, which limits the
percentage of the CPU the miner can use. It is not necessary
to set a throttle value, in this case the miner uses 100% of the
available processing power. We have discovered that when a
throttle value is set, this is often set to 0.3, meaning that 70%
of the processing power can be used by the miner. Setting a
throttle to use 70% of the resources seems to be balancing bet-
ween gaining enough proﬁt and not disturbing the browsing
experience too much. In the identiﬁed campaigns, the throt-
tle value is mostly set to the same value on all domains. An
exception is listed in Table 5, in which a campaign involving
180 websites uses two different throttle values.
Attack vectors encountered We were able to retrieve the
siteKey of actively cryptomining websites in 92% of the cases.
Most of the gathered siteKeys are only used once (78%) and
only a small portion (5%) is used on more than 5 different
websites. However, the siteKeys in this last category are found
on 4,663 different websites (46% of the total). The high num-
ber of siteKeys used only once suggests a large amount of
website owner initiated cryptojacking, since every domain
uses its own key. The fact that almost half of the websites is
part of a campaign involving at least 5 websites also indicates
different attack vectors. We have manually analyzed the used
siteKeys in the latter category, and we can conclude that, be-
sides website owner initiated cryptojacking, the use of third
party software is a prevailing attack vector. Third-party appli-
cations like WordPress, Drupal or Magento are often abused
to spread cryptojacking injections. These applications play a
major part in campaign analysis, as discussed in Section 6.1.
Figure 3: Distribution of cryptomining applications based on
the total crawl, the Alexa Top 1M and NetFlows analysis.
two stacked bars in Figure 3 show the distribution of miners
according to our analysis.
We have also discovered services which combine multiple
cryptomining applications. The most popular mining com-
bination is the set of Coinhive, Cryptoloot and Cryptonoter,
which are bundled in the implementation of the WordPress
Monero Miner plugin [21]. A combination of a Nerohut miner
with a Cryptoloot or Webminerpool miner is also regularly
encountered. Usually, only one miner starts (due to another
script deciding which one to use), but we also encountered
domains on which multiple miners were started concurrently.
Actual mining activity The distribution of mining appli-
cations installed on domains gives an insight into their po-
pularity by actors pursuing cryptomining, but not into their
actual usage. The amount of actual mining that takes place
can however be estimated by tracing the connections website
visitors make to the mining application’s WebSocket proxy,
as explained in Figure 1. We obtained a trace of connections
transported by a Tier 1 network operator in 1:8192 sampling
for a period of 14 months, and followed the WebSocket proxy
server IPs from these mining applications to estimate the traf-
ﬁc to these servers. This gives an insight into how much trafﬁc
these WebSocket proxies digest, and is therefore a more reli-
able source for popularity measures. The upper stacked bar
chart in Figure 3 shows the distribution of NetFlows to the
WebSocket proxy servers of known mining applications for
the month of December. The results show a drastic difference
between installation base and mining trafﬁc: while Coinhive
is found on most websites, CoinImp proxy servers handle
more than twice as much trafﬁc than the dominant applica-
tion. WebSocket trafﬁc to servers of Cryptoloot is similar in
size compared to its installation base.

applications such as NoCoin [17] or Minerblock [16], mining
scripts are more often hidden to prevent detection. We have
encountered a number of hiding techniques in our crawl and
distinguish the following levels of obfuscation:
1. No obfuscation. The script is loaded in clear text, key
and other options are visible to the user.
var miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous(’key’);
miner.start();
2. Limiting CPU usage. Script is loaded in clear text, key
and other options are visible to the user, but CPU usage
is throttled, so detection by the user is less likely.
3. Renamed variables. The script is loaded in clear text,
but (some) variable names have been changed. These
variable names are either replaced by random strings, or
by completely different words, such as on http://www.
2001.com.ve/:
startHarryPotter("boddington", "2001");
4. Renamed mining script. The loaded script is still in clear
text, but hosted on the web server itself instead of fetched
from a mining service. The ﬁle name is changed to pre-
vent blacklist blocking, frequently to general names, such
as jquery.js or stat.js.
5. Hidden inside other scripts. The miner is appended or
inserted into another script. The benign script still func-
tions as normal, but also starts up the mining process.
6. Obfuscated code. The loaded scripts are masked by a
code obfuscator and contain packed or CharCode code.
All application-speciﬁc strings are encoded, stored in an
array and variable names are replaced by random strings.
var _0x5d02=["\x75\x73\x65\x20\x73\x74", ..]
7. Obfuscated code and WebSocket trafﬁc. The loaded
script is obfuscated by a code obfuscator and WebSocket
trafﬁc is sent encrypted to the proxy server.
8. Obfuscated and hidden. Scripts are hidden inside other
ﬁles and/or via multiple redirects. Every script is ran-
domly named and obfuscated, and so is the WebSocket
trafﬁc. WebAssembly is not retrieved from the server,
but included inside the script.
In our crawl, most website owner initiated cryptojacking is
not obfuscated, often not even throttling CPU usage. Attacks
using third-party software are usually hiding cryptomining
code inside other scripts and apply some obfuscation. We have
encountered multiple WordPress themes and Drupal plugins
with such a hidden miner. Only 391 websites with encrypted
WebSocket have been identiﬁed, whereas most websites are
using plain text Stratum communication. The highest level of
obfuscation is rarely encountered.

domains depicted in a force-directed graph
6.1 Cryptojacking campaigns
We have identiﬁed 204 cryptojacking campaigns, covering
5,733 websites, meaning that 57% of all cryptojacking web-
sites encountered are part of a campaign. We deﬁne a cluster
of more than 5 websites to be a campaign, as stated in Sec-
tion 2. Figure 4 shows all the identiﬁed cryptojacking domains
in a force-directed graph, where domains with similar features
attract each other, colored according to the used application.
Clear clusters can be distinguished, such as a Monero-Mining
campaign shown in pink and a large Mineralt campaign shown
in green right above it. Coinhive, the application used the
most, is shown in dark blue with multiple large clusters all
over the graph. The circle represents the cryptojacking do-
mains not part of a campaign. In the following paragraphs,
we highlight our ﬁndings based on different possibilities for
identifying campaigns as introduced in Section 2.
Found on shared siteKey We were able to successfully
retrieve the siteKey of 92% of the actively cryptojacking do-
mains, which enabled us to cluster domains sharing the same
siteKey. A shared siteKey guarantees that the rewards for min-
ing will be transferred to the same account. We have identiﬁed
192 cryptojacking campaigns based on the same siteKey be-
ing installed on more than 5 different websites. As shown in
Table 5, the largest campaign covers 987 websites, all using
WordPress. A variety of plugins and themes include a mali-
cious ﬁle named jquory.js, which is responsible for starting

a Coinhive miner. A similar attack vector is observed in a
campaign involving 317 Drupal websites. This campaign is
part of the Drupalgeddon 2 and 3 attacks, which took advan-
tage of major remote code execution vulnerabilities in Drupal
to inject their malicious scripts [45]. The only large cam-
paign using the Mineralt miner, also focused on WordPress,
has base64 encoded its siteKey inside the script tags. This
makes them seem different, but match once decoded, since
only the throttle value is changed. Not just vulnerabilities
in CMS systems are used to spread cryptojacking code, also
Magento, an e-commerce system, is involved in a Coinhive
mining campaign targeting 175 websites in our crawl. The
largest campaign using the compromised websites attack vec-
tor involved 376 Chinese websites, which share a miner script
injected on the bottom of the page. A provider of The Pirate
Bay proxies orchestrates the largest website owner initiated
campaign on our list, with 70 proxy domains using the same
Cryptoloot miner. These ﬁndings indicate that the most suc-
cessful and largest cryptojacking campaigns are created by
abusing third-party software.
Found on shared WebSocket proxy server Most crypto-
jacking campaigns are using the infrastructure of popular
applications, such as Coinhive, to connect to a mining pool.
Thus, clustering domains on these WebSocket proxy servers
will not create meaningful clusters. However, when we discard
these popular proxy servers, we are able to identify another 12
campaigns, which have not already been identiﬁed by shared
siteKeys. Those are listed in Table 6. A Coincube miner cam-
paign involving 27 websites uses coin-services.info as a
WebSocket proxy server on a variety of ports. This campaign
hosts its miner scripts on code repositories such as GitHub
and BitBucket, where a number of accounts is created to host
the miner ﬁles, which are all named main.js. On one of the
GitHub accounts, even a picture of stacked Ukrainian money
can be found [15]. 28 very similar websites, all offering illegal
video streams, were found to be using a WebSocket proxy
server on wss://ws**.1q2w3.life/proxy with, after man-
ual inspection, seriesf.lv as the accompanied siteKey. This
proxy server was also discovered by [22] on 5 websites in
their crawl. They estimated that this campaign made a proﬁt
of $2,012.90 per month, which is likely to be a lot more, since
we have found almost 6 times as many domains involved in
this campaign. We have discovered that websites using a pri-
vate WebSocket proxy are more likely to hide their activities
by using higher levels of obfuscation.
Additionally, we have discovered 14 WebSocket proxy
servers with very similar addresses on 75 domains (e.g.
nflying.bid, flightzy.bid and flightsy.bid). These
servers are contacted by the most obfuscated miner encoun-
tered in this crawl. The miner code is hidden inside a ran-
domly named ﬁle, the miner code is heavily obfuscated and
the WebSocket trafﬁc is sometimes encrypted. Our efforts
to reverse engineer the obfuscated miner code are so far un-
successful. Therefore, we can not cluster them as being a
campaign based on the shared proxy servers, but we have
added the signature to our crawler as a separate mining appli-
cation for the next crawls.
Found on shared initiator ﬁle
In our crawling pro-
cess, the stack trace of an initialized WebSocket connec-
tion is saved for every website. While examining these
stack traces, some ﬁle names emerged and lead to the
identiﬁcation of another 4 cryptojacking campaigns. The
oddly named ﬁle gninimorenomv2.js, responsible for ope-
ning WebSocket connections on 24 websites seemed to
be part of a malicious advertisement campaign, which
injects cryptojacking scripts into served advertisements.
As shown in Table 6, this ﬁle opens a connection to
wss://heist.thefashiontip.com:8182/ to earn the pro-
ﬁts from the displayed mining advertisements. Another cam-
paign was identiﬁed by grouping the websites in which
adsmine.js was responsible for opening a WebSocket con-
nection. These websites turned out to be 17 very similar
pornography websites, which indicates that this campaign is
website owner initiated. The newly discovered mining appli-
cation, as described in the previous section, served obfuscated
mining scripts to its miners. Although obfuscated, inspec-
tion of the random ﬁle names revealed clusters of websites
injected with the same randomly named miner, which lead
to the discovery of another 3 campaigns, all targeting solely
WordPress websites.
Found on shared mining pool login Most miner applica-
tions submit their solved hashes to a WebSocket proxy server,
which combines the hashes of multiple miners before forward-
ing it to the actual mining pool. However, we have discovered
238 websites directly submitting their hashes to a mining pool.
These websites are using only six unique cryptocurrency wal-
let addresses. The shared wallet addresses guarantee that prof-
