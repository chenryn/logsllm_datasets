## Abstract
Identifying autonomous systems (ASs) that deploy specific inter-domain techniques, such as Route Flap Damping (RFD) or Route Origin Validation (ROV), remains a significant challenge. Previous approaches often relied on heuristics derived from passive and active measurements, which lacked accuracy or imposed strict limitations on measurement methods.

We introduce BeCAUSe, an algorithmic framework for network tomography that employs Bayesian computation for ASs. Using a novel combination of active probing and stochastic simulation, we present the first study to expose the deployment of RFD. Contrary to expectations, we find that at least 9% of measured ASs enable RFD, primarily using outdated vendor default configuration parameters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare BeCAUSe with three RFD heuristics and successfully apply a generalized Bayesian method to measure ROV deployment.

## 1 Introduction
In the mid-1990s, global backbone BGP-speaking routers experienced high CPU loads due to BGP churn, leading to the development of Route Flap Damping (RFD) in RFC 2439 [43]. RFD maintains a penalty value per prefix per session, suppressing prefixes with penalties above a threshold.

In 2002-2003, Mao et al. [24] showed that RFD was too aggressive and negatively impacted Internet routing. By 2006, more powerful routers led to the assumption that operators had removed RFD. However, in 2011, Pelsser et al. [30] demonstrated that more considered RFD settings were safe and beneficial, suggesting potential re-enablement. Despite this, the actual deployment of RFD has never been measured.

Understanding RFD deployment and parameters is crucial because RFD can cause issues in reaching Internet destinations and obscure control plane measurements. Heuristics have been used to address specific cases, but a general approach is needed.

This paper introduces BeCAUSe, a new tomographic approach using computational Bayesian techniques. We show how advanced methods like Metropolis-Hastings [22, 25] and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [13] can identify RFD ASs from path measurements, providing insights into RFD deployment.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **New Tomography Algorithms:** We present BeCAUSe, a group of algorithms adapted for large-scale routing inference.
2. **Measurement Infrastructure:** We develop RFD Beacons to provide inputs for the tomography problem.
3. **Large-Scale Study:** We conduct the first large-scale study of RFD deployment, based on over two months of data, revealing wider and less careful use than expected.

We test BeCAUSe on RFD and ROV inference problems, achieving 100% precision and 87% recall on limited ground truth data. BeCAUSe not only provides estimates but also a degree of certainty.

## 2 Background
### 2.1 Route Flap Damping in BGP
A router using RFD maintains a penalty value per prefix per BGP session, increasing with each announcement or withdrawal and decreasing exponentially. When the penalty exceeds a threshold, the prefix is suppressed until it decays below a second threshold.

Figure 2 illustrates RFD mechanics and key configuration parameters. At \( t_0 \), the penalty is initialized to 0 and increases with each update. Between updates, the penalty decreases based on the half-life parameter. When the penalty surpasses the suppress-threshold at \( t_1 \), the prefix is withdrawn. At \( t_2 \), the prefix stops oscillating, and the penalty reaches the reuse-threshold at \( t_3 \), releasing the damped prefix.

RFD's history, shown in Figure 3, includes its introduction, initial concerns, and subsequent recommendations. While much is known about RFD mechanics, little is known about its deployment.

RFD may be deployed non-uniformly within an AS, limited to specific peers or configured differently for various prefix lengths. This variability complicates the identification of RFD ASs, which can be formulated as a binary network tomography problem.

### 2.2 AS Inference Problems in General
RFD is part of a broader class of problems where we aim to localize specific routing policies or techniques in the inter-AS network. Other examples include identifying ASs that use particular communities or blackhole certain traffic. Beyond RFD, we aim to solve a range of such problems, including RPKI origin validation.

### 2.3 Binary Network Tomography
Network tomography reveals internal network characteristics from external observations. In our case, we seek to infer node properties (e.g., RFD deployment) from path properties. Binary tomography, where nodes either have a property or not, is applicable here.

Mathematically, we define:
\[ x_i = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if node } i \text{ has property A}, \\
1 & \text{if node } i \text{ does not have property A}.
\end{cases} \]
\[ y_j = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if path } j \text{ has property A}, \\
1 & \text{if path } j \text{ does not have property A}.
\end{cases} \]

For a path \( j \) consisting of nodes \( N_j \):
\[ y_j = \prod_{i \in N_j} x_i \]

This results in a set of equations, one for each measurement. Solving these equations ideally solves the localization problem and reveals the damping ASs.

However, tomography problems face challenges:
1. **Insufficient Path Measurements:** Rarely are there enough measurements for a unique solution, requiring side information to refine solutions.
2. **Measurement Noise:** Inherent noise can make equations inconsistent, necessitating robust approaches that look for approximate matches.

These challenges highlight the need for advanced methods like BeCAUSe, which can handle the complexities of real-world data.
