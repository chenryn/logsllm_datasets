shows that these mechanisms are not a panacea: name
mismatch errors constitute a large fraction of errors, and
new systems like Perspectives and Convergence still per-

5.2.4 Additional SSL Metrics
We collected several additional metrics to complement
the overall clickthrough rates.
More Information. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
both place additional information about the warning be-
hind links. However, very few users took the opportunity
to view this extra information. The “Help me understand”
button was clicked during 1.6% of Google Chrome SSL
warning impressions. For Mozilla Firefox warnings, 0
users clicked on “Technical Details,” and 3% of viewers
of the “Add Exception” dialog clicked on “View Certiﬁ-
cate.” This additional content therefore has no meaningful
impact on the overall clickthrough rates.
Add Exception Cancellation. Not all Mozilla Firefox
5Convergence does not check the certiﬁcate issuer, relying on net-
work views instead. However, it performs name checks [10].

users proceed to the page after opening the “Add Excep-
tion” dialog: 14.6% of the time that a dialog is opened,
the user cancels the exception. These occurrences indi-
cate that at least a minority of users consider the text in
the dialog before conﬁrming the exception.
Remember Exception. By default, the “Remember Ex-
ception” checkbox is checked in the Mozilla Firefox “Add
Exception” dialog. Our measurements found that 21.3%
of the time that the dialog is opened, the user un-ticks the
checkbox. We hypothesize that these users are still wary
of the website even if they choose to proceed.
6 Time Spent On SSL Warnings
In addition to MITM attacks, SSL warnings can occur
due to server misconﬁgurations. Previous work found that
20% of the thousand most popular SSL sites triggered a
false warning due to such misconﬁgurations [31]. Con-
sequently, it may be safe and rational to click through
such false warnings. The prevalence of a large number of
such false warnings can potentially train users to consider
all SSL warnings false alarms and click through them
without considering the context.
In order to determine whether users examine SSL warn-
ings before making a decision, we measured how much
time people spent on SSL warning pages. In this section,
we compare the click times by outcome (clickthrough or
leave) and error type to gain insight into user attention.
Our timing data is for all operating systems and channels.

type. The graph shows the percent of warning impressions that

and we cut off the distribution at 90% due to the long tail.
users who click through and proceed to the page. 47% of
users who clicked through the warning made the decision
within 1.5s, whereas 47% of users who left the page did so
within 3.5s. We interpret this to mean that users who click
through the warning often do so after less consideration.
6.2 Time by Error Type
Figure 7 depicts the click times for three error types (un-
trusted authority, name mismatch, and expired certiﬁcate
errors). Users clicked through 49% of untrusted issuer
warning impressions within 1.7s, but clicked through 50%
of name and date errors within 2.2s and 2.7s, respectively.
We believe that this data is indicative of warning fatigue:
users click through more-frequent errors more quickly.
The frequency and clickthrough rate of each error type
(as reported in Section 5.2) are inversely correlated with
that error type’s timing variance and mode (Figure 7).

Implications
Our primary ﬁnding is that browser security warnings can
be effective security mechanisms in practice, but their
effectiveness varies widely. This should motivate more
attention to improving security warnings. In this section,
we summarize our ﬁndings and their implications, present
suggestions for warning designers, and make recommen-
dations for future warning studies.
security warnings can be highly effective at preventing
users from visiting websites: as few as a tenth of users
click through Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings.
We consider these warnings very successful.
We found clickthrough rates of 18.0% and 23.2% for
Google Chrome’s phishing and malware warnings, re-
spectively, and 31.6% for Firefox’s SSL warning. These
warnings prevent 70% (or more) of attempted visits to
potentially dangerous websites. Although these warnings
could be improved, we likewise consider these warnings
successful at persuading and protecting users.
Google Chrome’s SSL warning had a clickthrough rate
of 70.2%. Such a high clickthrough rate is undesirable:
either users are not heeding valid warnings, or the browser
is annoying users with invalid warnings and possibly caus-
ing warning fatigue. Our positive ﬁndings for the other
warnings demonstrate that this warning has the poten-
tial for improvement. We hope that this study motivates
further studies to determine and address the cause of its
higher clickthrough rate. We plan to test an exception-
remembering feature to investigate the inﬂuence of repeat
exposures to warnings. At Google, we have also begun a
series of A/B tests in the ﬁeld to measure the impact of a
number of improvements.
7.1.2 User Attention
Although we did not directly study user attention, two
results of our study suggest that at least a minority of
users pay attention to browser security warnings.
• There is a 24.4-point difference between the click-
through rates for untrusted issuer errors (81.8%) and
expired certiﬁcate errors (57.4%) in Google Chrome.
• 21.3% of the time that Mozilla Firefox users viewed
the “Add Exception” dialog, they un-checked the
default “Permanently store this exception” option.
These results contradict the stereotype of wholly obliv-
ious users with no interest in security.
7.2 Comparison with Prior Research
As Bravo-Lillo et al. wrote [5]:
Evidence from experimental studies indicates
that most people don’t read computer warnings,
don’t understand them, or simply don’t heed
them, even when the situation is clearly haz-
ardous.
7.1 Warning Effectiveness
7.1.1 Clickthrough Rates
Popular opinion holds that browser security warnings are
ineffective. However, our study demonstrates that browser
In contrast, a majority of users heeded ﬁve of the six
types of browser warnings that we studied. This section
explores why our results differ from prior research.
Browser Changes. Most prior browser research was con-
ducted between 2002 and 2009. Browsers were rapidly

understand the impact of these factors on user behavior.
Similar studies could help understand SSL clickthrough
rates; recent work addressed how to reproduce certiﬁcate
validation at the network monitor [1].
changing during this time period; some changes were
directly motivated by published user studies. Notably,
passive indicators are no longer considered primary secu-
rity tools, and phishing toolbars have been replaced with
browser-provided, full-page interstitial warnings. As a re-
sult, studies of passive indicators and phishing toolbars no
longer represent the state of modern browser technology.
Two studies tested an older version of the Mozilla Fire-
fox SSL warning, in which the warning was a modal
(instead of full-page) dialog. Dhamija et al. observed
a 68% clickthrough rate, and Sunshine et al. recorded
clickthrough rates of 90%-95% depending on the type of
page [11, 31]. The change in warning design could be
responsible for our lower observed clickthrough rates.
Ecological Invalidity. Sunshine et al. and Sotirakopoulos
et al. recorded 55%-60% and 80% clickthrough rates, re-
spectively, for a slightly outdated version of the Mozilla
Firefox SSL warning [30, 31]. They evaluated the Fire-
fox 3 and 3.5 warnings, which had the same layout and
appearance as the current (Firefox 4+) warning but with
different wording.
It’s possible that changes in word-
ing caused clickthrough rates to drop from 55%-80% to
33.0%. However, during an exit survey, 46% of Soti-
rakopoulos’s subjects said they clicked through the warn-
ing because they either felt safe in the laboratory envi-
ronment or wanted to complete the task [30]. Since their
study methodology was intentionally similar to the Sun-
shine study, Sotirakopoulos et al. concluded that both
studies suffered from biases that raised their clickthrough
rates [30]. We therefore attribute some of the discrepancy
between our ﬁeld study data and these two laboratory
studies to the difﬁculty of establishing ecological validity
in a laboratory environment.
In light of this, we recommend a renewed emphasis
on ﬁeld techniques for running and conﬁrming user stud-
ies of warnings. Although we used in-browser telemetry,
there are other ways of obtaining ﬁeld data. For exam-
ple, experience sampling is a ﬁeld study methodology
that asks participants to periodically answer questions
about a topic [2, 6, 9, 28]. Researchers could install a
browser extension on participants’ computers to observe
their responses to normally occurring warnings and dis-
play a survey after each warning. This technique allows
researchers to collect data about participants’ emotions,
comprehension, and demographics. Participants may be-
come more cautious or attentive to warnings if the pur-
pose of the study is apparent, so researchers could obscure
the purpose by surveying subjects about other browser
topics. Network-based ﬁeld measurements also provide
an alternative methodology with high ecological validity.
A network monitor could maintain its own copy of the
Safe Browsing list and identify users who click through
warnings. If the monitor can associate network ﬂows

than other errors. Our ﬁndings support recent literature
that has modeled user attention to security warnings as
a ﬁnite resource [4] and proposed warning mechanisms
based on this constraint [14].
Based on this ﬁnding, we echo the recommendation
that security practitioners should limit the number of warn-
ings that users encounter. Designers of new warning
mechanisms should always perform an analysis of the
number of times the system is projected to raise a warn-
ing, and security practitioners should consider the effects
that warning architectures have on warning fatigue.
“More Information”
7.6
Users rarely click on the explanatory links such as “More
Information” or “Learn More” (Section 5.2.4). Designers
who utilize such links should ensure that they do not hide
a detail that is important to the decision-making process.
Mozilla Firefox places information about SSL errors
under “Technical Details” and in the “Add Exception”
dialog instead of the primary warning. Thus, the error
type has little impact on clickthrough rates. In contrast,
Google Chrome places error details in the main text of
its SSL warning, and the error has a large effect on user
behavior. It is possible that moving this information into
