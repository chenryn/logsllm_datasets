User: I'm a newbie to SCons and also using pydev. Can someone help me with instructions on how to debug scons scripts using Eclipse and pydev? Is it even possible considering the fact that SCons is a seperate app and not an extension to python?
Assistant: I've since gain more experience with SCons / Python and I'd recommend using python's pdb module. To use it simply add the following code to your SCons/Python files.
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
When the file is run from the command line a breakpoint will be hit at this line. I also moved away from Eclipse. A lightweight editor will be just as good for Python development. I use Sublime.
