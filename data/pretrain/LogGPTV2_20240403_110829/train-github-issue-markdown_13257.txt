has 7 errors and
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/a92f447d8a9190c8d118bae9baac63d122a96ea1/examples/models/vrml/house.wrl
has 45 errors when validated by Chisel (
http://www2.hrp.no/vr/tools/chisel/install.htm ).
The first error rof the dev version is at line 1902: "not a valid field for
Transform"
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/models/vrml/house.wrl#L1902
It looks like the children field is missing for the enclosing transform.
I noticed because cobweb ( http://titania.create3000.de/cobweb/ ) - a capable
VRML browser - reported the same problem with the dev file.
