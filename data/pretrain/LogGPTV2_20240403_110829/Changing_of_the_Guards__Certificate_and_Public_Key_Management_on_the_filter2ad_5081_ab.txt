if it was an exact match, if it is more precise, or if it is less precise. To
allow wildcard certiﬁcates to be replaced by multiple certiﬁcates, a wildcard
certiﬁcate is considered for multiple matches if it has the same birth date as
the ﬁrst found CR.
– Step 5 (identify SKCR chains): Finally, we used the SHA1 hashes of the
replaced and replacing certiﬁcate of each CR in which the two certiﬁcates
contained the same public key (i.e., an SKCR relationship) to identify chains
of SKCRs. Starting from the base case of a single SKCR, which has a chain
length of one, we search for additional CRs for which the replaced certiﬁcate
was the replacing certiﬁcate of the most recent SKCR. The chaining was
repeated until ether a new public key was used in the chain, or until no
matching CR could be found.
Our analysis mostly focuses on the outputs from steps 4 and 5.
Limitations: Like most internet measurements, the Rapid7 dataset has its lim-
itations. First, the biweekly scans limit how ﬁne a granularity we can consider
for CRs. Second, Project Sonar only tries each IP address once during a scan.
While many certiﬁcates are seen across many IPs, this could potentially intro-
duce biases against certiﬁcates of services with few servers or that are further
away from the scanners. Third, the dataset does not capture how many real users
download each certiﬁcate or how popular the services using the certiﬁcates are.
Here, we treat all certiﬁcates observed in the Rapid7 datasets equally. Fourth,
the Rapid7 dataset misses many certiﬁcates that may be found in CT logs [78].
While this may cause us to miss some certiﬁcates that may be of interest, the
Rapid7 dataset has the advantage that it allows us to measure when a certiﬁ-
cate was used (not only what its intended validity period is) and helps focus on
certiﬁcates actually observed in the wild.

these for which the second certiﬁcate had a new issuer (top panes). The ranking of
CAs are shown based on the certiﬁcates from the last three years (2018–2020) shown
using combined boxes around those years.
Fifth, some HTTPS servers listen on ports other than 443. The addition
of scans of non-443 ports could have increased the observed lifetimes of some
certiﬁcates. However, the majority of HTTPS servers use port 443. Sixth, long-
lived certiﬁcates can bias the CRs observed in the beginning of the measurement
period and CRs with large gaps may be missed towards the end. Given current
validation period and overlap distributions, these biases should have limited
impact on the set of CRs identiﬁed between 2016–2019. Despite these limitations,
we believe our analysis provides an insightful glimpse into HTTPS certiﬁcate and
public key management on the Internet over the past seven years.
Finally, we acknowledge that our paper would beneﬁt from a measure of how
often security incidents exploited revoked certiﬁcates. For example, such a mea-
sure would enable a risk assessment and help determine the ideal validity period
of a certiﬁcate. However, to the best of our knowledge, such a measurement has
not been published and is out of scope of our paper.
3 Certiﬁcate Replacement Analysis
In total, we observed 217,221,681 unique certiﬁcates and identiﬁed 129,382,646
CRs. After ﬁltering out self-issued and self-signed certiﬁcates, the number of
CRs reduced to 108,751,863. (21.4 million CRs for the set ≤2017, 22.8 million
for 2018, 35.9 million for 2019, and 28.6 million for 2020 (Jan-Jun).)
3.1 Certiﬁcate Selection Characterization
Not all certiﬁcates are created and managed in the same way. For example,
diﬀerent CAs oﬀer diﬀerent trust, issuing processes, and costs, and there are
several validation types. Diﬀerent websites therefore make diﬀerent choices, and
some may change CAs. Figure 3 summarizes the most common certiﬁcate choices
56

in the last few years. The bottom panes show the total number of CRs per
certiﬁcate type and issuer, and the top panes show the fraction of those CRs that
changed issuer. Throughout the paper we label CRs using the characteristics of
the replaced certiﬁcate and say that the issuer has changed whenever the issuer’s
common name (issuerCN) is diﬀerent. For the per-CA breakdown we rank the
CAs based on the number of CRs between 2018–2020 (shown as combined bars
in the plot) and only show results for CAs with at least 100,000 CRs and for
which the majority of the certiﬁcates are approved by the major browser vendor’s
trust stores. When interpreting these plots, it is important to note that a CR
represents a successful certiﬁcate replacement.
For the analysis in this paper, we omit self-signed and self-issued certiﬁcates.
Prior works have shown that these certiﬁcates are responsible for the majority
of invalid certiﬁcates in the dataset [29]. To illustrate how big a portion of the
CRs that these two certiﬁcate types represent we include them in the right-hand
panes here, but exclude them from all other analysis (including the results shown
in the left-hand panes). Here it is important to note that the majority of the
studied certiﬁcates are issued by the top-CA.
Certiﬁcate Types and Issuer Changes: There are big diﬀerences in the
issuance requirements of diﬀerent validity types. Domain Validated (DV) cer-
tiﬁcates have the least requirements and Extended Validation (EV) certiﬁcates
the most rigorous (and time consuming) requirements [7]. Organization Vali-
dated (OV) and Individual Validation (IV) certiﬁcates fall between the two,
adding somewhat to the requirements (and costs) of DVs [5]. DV certiﬁcates
is the dominating certiﬁcate type in the dataset. Customers using DV certiﬁ-
cates seldomly change issuer. A key reason for the higher issuer change rates of
the other types is likely customers switching to cheaper services (e.g., free DV
certiﬁcates). Two contributing factors for users having moved away from EV
certiﬁcates during this period may be (1) the introduction of Let’s Encrypt’s
free and easy-to-use DV certiﬁcates and (2) several major browsers (e.g., Safari,
Chrome, Firefox) ending or announcing the ending of user interfaces displaying
EV certiﬁcates diﬀerently than DV certiﬁcates. Both these aspects are expected
to have reduced the incentive to spend extra money/eﬀort for EV certiﬁcates.
Selected CAs and Their Retention Rates: For the per-CA breakdown, we
rank CAs based on CRs between 2018–2020 and only show results for CAs with
at least 100,000 CRs and for which the majority of the certiﬁcates are approved
by the major browser vendors’ trust stores (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla/NSS).
With these root stores having been responsible for most TLS user agents [56]
at the time the dataset was collected (and before Chrome released their own
root store in Dec. 2020 [6]) and all of them having signiﬁcant overlaps in their
root selections [45], we expect these CAs to have very good end-user reach.
Both Symantec and GeoTrust have had very few CRs the last two years (pur-
ple+orange bars in bottom-right pane of Fig. 3). This is also reﬂected by the
high rate of new issuers associated with CRs involving these two CAs (con-
stantly above 25% for all four time buckets). Domains leaving Symantec is per-
haps not surprising given that Google over this time period implemented a plan

to distrust Symantec [65]. Microsoft and TrustAsia have also seen high issuer
churn over this time period. Of the dominant CAs, Let’s Encrypt has the lowest
change rate, suggesting that they have a high customer retention rate. DigiCert’s
change rate is increasing over time, while Google, Sectigo (formerly Comodo),
and GlobalSign were able to improve their retention rates in 2020.
3.2 Analysis Using Mismanagement Indicators
Changing a certiﬁcate (or CA) is not always seamless. We next look closer at
potential mismanagement indicators, including CRs with gaps between the valid-
ity periods of the two certiﬁcates in the CR, and the certiﬁcates that are used
either after their expiry or before their validity period started. These results are
summarized in Fig. 4. For this and all later ﬁgures, all results are based only
on the CRs from 2019 (the most recent complete year of data we have; marked
“*”), unless a diﬀerent year is indicated (labeled “≤2017”, “2018” or “2020”),
and we use the same order of the CAs as provided by the rankings in Fig. 3.
Decreasing Fraction of Gaps: There has been a clear improvement over time.
For example, since CRs including 2017 (9.34% gapped), the fraction of CRs with
a gap has steadily decreased and was more than halved by 2020 (4.26%). This
suggests that servers may be becoming better at replacing their certiﬁcates on
time. One possible explanation is that Chrome and other browsers increasingly
inform and/or block users from accessing websites that do not meet current
HTTPS standards and practices, incentivizing websites to be compliant.
Changing CA More Frequently Results in Gaps: We have observed a
disproportionate fraction of gaps associated with issuer changes. This may in
part be due to some administrators leaving updates until it is too late. We have
also found that the ﬁrst certiﬁcate in a CR with overlapping validity periods
typically is used for the better part of the overlap period, suggesting that server
administrators may not be in a rush to switch to the replacement certiﬁcate or
that they do not always get access to them right away, even when the certiﬁcate
has an overlapping validity period.
58

Reuse of Keys: At an aggregate level, the reuse of keys does not appear to
change the fraction of CR gaps, post-usage of expired certiﬁcates, or the pre-
usage of not-yet valid certiﬁcates. Sect. 4 analyzes this case further.
CRs with EV and OV Certiﬁcates Have the Fewest Gaps: The CRs
with the fewest-to-most gaps are: EV, OV, DV, and IV. This suggests that ser-
vices that pay extra for EV (and OV) certiﬁcates indeed manage to ensure that
they have fewer CR gaps than organizations that use cheaper DV certiﬁcates.
This could potentially be due to diﬀerences in operational support between such
websites. As IV usage is becoming increasingly rare, people may ﬁnd fewer rea-
sons to keep them up-to-date. Furthermore, with the use of timestamped code,
code-signing certiﬁcates can be used for validation also after expiration [67].
Management Indicators Diﬀer Substantially Across CAs: First, there is
a big diﬀerence between the CAs with the largest fraction of gapped (bad) and
overlapping (good) CRs. Like for validation types, the largest fraction of gapped
CRs is associated with the CAs with the lowest retention rates and decreasing
usage: Symantec (25%), GeoTrust (38%), and TrustAsia (32%). As expected,
these three CAs also have the largest fraction of certiﬁcates used after their
expiry date. We also observed 9.3% gaps associated with the free DV certiﬁcates
issued by Let’s Encrypt. In contrast, CRs with certiﬁcates issued by Microsoft
(0.08%), CSC (0.4%), Google (1.0%), Entrust (1.1%), Amazon (1.7%), and Dig-
iCert (1.9%) are much less likely to have gaps. The relatively low fraction of
gaps suggests a signiﬁcant level of automation and/or better process for certiﬁ-
cate replacements. Second, we have observed a substantially higher fraction of
certiﬁcate observations timestamped before they were valid when issued by four
(diﬀerent) CAs: Go Daddy (5.4%), Entrust (4.2%), GlobalSign (3.3%), and Let’s
Encrypt (2.8%). While the exact fraction of certiﬁcates observed early may be
inﬂated by the granularity and accuracy of our birth estimates, the signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the CAs are substantial and shows that some CAs may use
signiﬁcantly bigger safety margins than others to ensure that some clients (with
clock oﬀsets, for example) does not invalidate an okay certiﬁcate. Careful cer-
tiﬁcate management include both using suﬃcient overlap in the validity periods
and deciding when to switch from using one certiﬁcate of a CR to the next.
The above diﬀerences may also be an indication that diﬀerent classes of
organizations are more likely to choose certain CAs. For example, one would
expect signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the fraction of gaps between organizations that
depend on HTTPS for their business and those that simply want a web presence.
The latter likely lack either the incentives or the means to prevent problems like
gaps. Our results also suggest that organizations that are looking to switch CAs
(possibly due to cost) are likely to contribute to yet additional one-time gaps.
EV and OV Certiﬁcates are More Carefully Managed: Similar to gapped
CRs, the fraction of certiﬁcates that are used after or before their validity period
is much smaller for OV and EV certiﬁcates than for DV certiﬁcates. This again
shows that organizations employing such certiﬁcates indeed appear to manage
their certiﬁcates more carefully.

Fig. 5. Validity periods and CR overlaps. For each CR category, we show the 10-
percentile (bottom marker), 25-percentile (bottom of box), median (middle/black
marker), 75-percentile (top of box), and 90-percentile (top marker). Only 2019 CRs
are used here (with exception for the three categories “2020”, “2018” and “≤2017” to
the left).
3.3 Overlap Analysis
Overlapping validity periods are typically used to protect against service outages.
To better understand the safety margins used in practice, we next compare and
contrast the overlaps of diﬀerent CR sets. Figure 5 shows a box-and-whisker plot
of the CR overlaps and the validity periods, for diﬀerent categories of CRs.
Decreasing Overlaps: Regardless of which percentile we consider, overlaps
have decreased over time. This observation is both interesting and encouraging,
when considered in combination with our earlier observation that the fraction of
gapped CRs has reduced substantially over the same period.
The above reductions have been achieved at the same time that the valida-
tion periods themselves have been reduced. The reduction in validity periods is
particularly clear when considering the fraction of long-lived certiﬁcates (e.g.,
see 90-percentile values in Fig. 5) that have been pushed away by new regula-
tions and best practices such as the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements
(BR) [5]. This trend towards shorter validity periods is expected to continue.
As an example, in March 2020, Apple decided to reduce the maximum allowed
lifetime of certiﬁcates in its root policy to 398 days (previously 825 days) for cer-
tiﬁcates issued starting September 2020 [12,31]. Chrome (June), Mozilla (July)
and the BR (July) have since followed suit [25,40,81].
Gap Issues with Older (long-lived) Certiﬁcates: There is a disproportion-
ate fraction of gaps associated with instances where old long-lived certiﬁcates
expire. One possible explanation is that without automated solutions, the use of
long-lived certiﬁcates increases the chance that a customer forgets to renew the
certiﬁcate in time. While we expect CAs using automated issuance to be more
