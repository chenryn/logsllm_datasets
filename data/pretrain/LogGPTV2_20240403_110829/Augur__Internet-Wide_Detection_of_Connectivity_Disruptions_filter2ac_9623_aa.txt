Abstract—Anecdotes, news reports, and policy brieﬁngs col-
lectively suggest that Internet censorship practices are pervasive.
The scale and diversity of Internet censorship practices makes it
difﬁcult to precisely monitor where, when, and how censorship
occurs, as well as what is censored. The potential risks in
performing the measurements make this problem even more
challenging. As a result, many accounts of censorship begin—and
end—with anecdotes or short-term studies from only a handful
of vantage points.
We seek to instead continuously monitor information about
Internet reachability, to capture the onset or termination of
censorship across regions and ISPs. To achieve this goal, we
introduce Augur, a method and accompanying system that utilizes
TCP/IP side channels to measure reachability between two
Internet locations without directly controlling a measurement
vantage point at either location. Using these side channels,
coupled with techniques to ensure safety by not implicating
individual users, we develop scalable, statistically robust methods
to infer network-layer ﬁltering, and implement a corresponding
system capable of performing continuous monitoring of global
censorship. We validate our measurements of Internet-wide
disruption in nearly 180 countries over 17 days against sites
known to be frequently blocked; we also identify the countries
where connectivity disruption is most prevalent.
I. INTRODUCTION
Anecdotes, news reports, and policy brieﬁngs collectively
suggest that Internet censorship practices are pervasive. Many
countries employ a variety of techniques to prevent
their
citizenry from accessing a wide spectrum of information and
services, spanning the range from content sensitive for political
or religious reasons, to microblogging, gambling, pornography,
and suicide, to the use of censorship circumvention systems
themselves. Unfortunately, despite the fact
that censorship
affects billions of people, our understanding of its practices
and techniques remains for the most part pointwise. Studies
and accounts heavily focus on the state of censorship in a
single country, often as seen at a single point in time. We
lack global views that comprehensively span the worldwide
Internet, and we lack continual views that ﬂag the onset of
new censorship and relaxation of existing censorship.
To date, efforts to obtain global visibility into censorship
practices have required some sort of network presence in each
country to monitor. This might mean the use of network
proxies, such as ICLab’s use of VPN exits [28], or the
deployment of dedicated systems, such as by OONI [48].
These approaches remain difﬁcult to deploy in practice: for

example, some countries might not have globally available
VPN exits within them, or may have censors that block
the network access required for the measurements (such as
OONI’s use of Tor). Another approach is to opportunistically
leverage a network presence in a given country using browser-
based remote measurement of potential censorship [45]. This
method can have difﬁculties in obtaining fully global views,
though, because it is driven by end-user browsing choices.
Due to its potential for implicating end users in attempting to
access prohibited Internet sites, it can only be used broadly
to measure reachability to sites that would pose minimal
additional risk to users, which limits its utility for measuring
reachability to a broad range of sites.
Fortunately, advances in TCP/IP side-channel measurement
techniques offer a new paradigm for obtaining global-scale
visibility into Internet connectivity. Ensaﬁ et al. recently
developed Hybrid-Idle Scan, a method whereby a third vantage
point can determine the state of network-layer reachability
between two other endpoints [22]. In other words, an off-path
measurement system can infer whether two remote systems
can communicate with one another, regardless of where these
two remote systems are located. To perform these measure-
ments, the off-path system must be able to spoof packets
(i.e.,
it must reside in a network that does not perform
egress ﬁltering), and one of the two endpoints must use a
single shared counter for generating the IP identiﬁer value
for packets that
it generates. This technique provides the
possibility of measuring network-layer reachability around the
world by locating endpoints within each country that use a
shared IP ID counter. By measuring the progression of this
counter over time, as well as whether our attempts to perturb
it from other locations on the Internet, we can determine
the reachability status between pairs of Internet endpoints.
This technique makes it possible to conduct measurements
continuously, across a large number of vantage points.
Despite the conceptual appeal of this approach, realizing
the method poses many challenges. One challenge concerns
ethics: Using this method can make it appear as though a
user in some country is attempting to communicate with a
potentially censored destination, which could imperil users.
To abide by the ethical guidelines set out by the Menlo [19]
and Belmont [9] reports, we exercise great care to ensure
that we perform our measurements from Internet infrastructure
(e.g., routers, middleboxes), as opposed to user machines. A
second challenge concerns statistical robustness in the face

of unrelated network activity that could interfere with the
measurements, as well as other systematic errors concerning
the behavior of TCP/IP side channels that sometimes only
become apparent at scale. To address these challenges we
introduce Augur. To perform detection in the face of uncer-
tainty, we model the IP ID increment over a time interval
as a random variable that we can condition on two different
priors: with and without responses to our attempts to perturb
the counter from another remote Internet endpoint. Given these
two distributions, we can then apply statistical hypothesis
testing based on maximum likelihood ratios.
We validate our Augur measurements of Internet-wide dis-
ruption in nearly 180 countries over 17 days against both block
lists from other organizations as well as known IP addresses
for Tor bridges. We ﬁnd that our results are consistent with the
expected ﬁltering behavior from these sites. We also identify
the top countries that experience connectivity disruption; our
results highlight many of the world’s most infamous censors.
We begin in Section II with a discussion of related work.
In Section III, we provide an overview of our method. We
present Augur in Section IV, introducing the principles behind
using IP ID side channels for third-party measurement of cen-
sorship; discussing how to identify remote systems that enable
us to conduct our measurements in an ethically responsible
manner; and delving into the extensive considerations required
for robust
inference. In Section V, we present a concrete
implementation of Augur. In Section VI, we validate Augur’s
accuracy and provide an accompanying analysis of global
censorship practices observed during our measurement run.
We offer thoughts related to further developing our approach
in Section VII and conclude in Section VIII.
II. RELATED WORK
Previous work spans several related areas. We begin with
a discussion of closely related work on connectivity mea-
surements using side channels. We then discuss previous
research which has performed pointwise studies of censorship
in various countries, as well as tools that researchers have
developed to facilitate these direct measurements. Finally, we
discuss previous studies that have highlighted the variability
and volatility of censorship measurements over time and across
regions, which motivates our work.
Measuring connectivity disruptions with side channels.
Previous work has employed side channels to infer network
properties such as topology, trafﬁc usage, or ﬁrewall rules
between two remote hosts. Some of these techniques rely
on the fact that the IP identiﬁer (IP ID) ﬁeld can reveal
network interfaces that belong to the same Internet router, the
number of packets that a device generates [13], or the blocking
direction of mail server ports for anti-spam purposes [43].
The SYN backlog also provides another signal that helps
with the discovery of machines behind ﬁrewalls [23], [55].
Ensaﬁ et al. [22] observed that combining information from
the TCP SYN backlog (which initiates retransmissions of SYN
ACK packets) with IP ID changes can reveal packet loss
between two remote hosts, including the direction along the
path where packet drops occurred; the authors demonstrated
the utility of their technique by measuring the reachability
of Tor relays from China [24]. Our work builds on this
technique by developing robust statistical detection methods to
disambiguate connectivity disruptions from other effects that
induce signals in these side channels.
Direct measurements from in-country vantage points. Re-
searchers have performed many pointwise measurement stud-
ies that directly measure connectivity disruptions in countries
including China [5], [16], [56], Iran [7], Pakistan [33], [38],
and Syria [12]. These studies have typically relied on obtaining
vantage points in target countries, often by renting virtual
private servers (VPSs) and performing measurements from
that vantage point. These direct measurements have served
to reveal censorship mechanisms, including country-wide In-
ternet outages [17], the injection of fake DNS replies [6],
[34], the blocking of TCP/IP connections [53], HTTP-level
blocking [18], [30], [42], and trafﬁc throttling [3]. In general,
studies involving direct measurements can shed more light on
speciﬁc mechanisms that a censor might employ. By contrast,
the techniques we develop rely on indirect side channels,
which limits the types of measurements that we can perform.
On the other hand, our approach permits a much larger scale
than any of these previous studies, as well as the ability to
conduct measurements continuously. Although these studies
provide valuable insights, their scale often involves a single
vantage point for a limited amount of time (typically no more
than a few weeks). Our aim is to shed light on a much broader
array of Internet vantage points, continuously over time.
Tools to facilitate direct measurements. OONI performs
an ongoing set of censorship measurement
tests from the
vantage points of volunteer participants. It runs on both
personal machines and embedded devices such as Raspberry
Pis [26]. Although OONI performs a more comprehensive
set of tests than we can with our indirect measurement, the
tool has deployment at a limited number of vantage points.
CensMon [46] only runs on PlanetLab nodes, limiting its
visibility to academic networks that can experience different
ﬁltering practices than residential or commercial networks
within a country. UBICA [1] aimed to increase vantage
points by running censorship measurement software on home
gateway devices and user desktops. These systems require
points of contact within a country to establish and maintain
the infrastructure. The OpenNet Initiative [41] leverages social
connections to people around the world to perform one-off
censorship measurements from home networks. As these mea-
surements are collected opportunistically with no systematic
baseline,
to draw consistent, repeatable
conclusions.
it can be difﬁcult
Studies that highlight the temporal and spatial variability

connectivity disruptions hold relatively static, then existing

up a global picture of conditions. Previous work, however,
has demonstrated that censorship practices vary across time;
across different applications; and across regions and Internet
service providers, even within a single country. For example,
previous research found that governments target a variety of
services such as video portals (e.g., YouTube) [51], news sites
(e.g., bbc.com) [8], and anonymity tools (e.g., Tor) [53].
For example, Ensaﬁ [21] showed that China’s Great Fire-
wall (GFW) actively probes—and blocks upon conﬁrmation—
servers suspected to abet circumvention. Many studies show
that different countries employ different censorship mecha-
nisms beyond IP address blocking to censor similar content
or applications, such as Tor [50]. Occasionally, countries also
deploy new censorship technology shortly before signiﬁcant
political events. For example Aryan [7] studied censorship
in Iran before and after the June 2013 presidential election.
The observations of variable and volatile ﬁltering practices
underscore the need for our work, since none of the existing
techniques capture such variations.
III. METHOD OVERVIEW
In this section, we provide an overview of the measurement
method that we developed to detect ﬁltering. We frame the
design goals that we aim to achieve and the core technique
underlying our approach. Then in Section IV we provide a
detailed explanation of the system’s operations.
A. Design Goals
We ﬁrst present a high-level overview of the strategy under-
lying our method, which we base on inducing and observing
potential increments in an Internet host’s IP ID ﬁeld. The
technique relies on causing one host on the Internet to send
trafﬁc to another (potentially blocked) Internet destination;
thus, we also consider the ethics of the approach. Finally, we
discuss the details of the method, including how we select the
speciﬁc Internet endpoints used to conduct the measurements.
Ultimately, the measurement system that we design should
achieve the following properties:
• Scalable. Because ﬁltering can vary across regions or
ISPs within a single country, the system must be able
to assess the state of ﬁltering from a large number of
vantage points. Filtering will also vary across different
destinations, so the system must also be able to measure
ﬁltering to many potential endpoints.
• Efﬁcient. Because ﬁltering practices change over time, es-
tablishing regular baseline measurements is important, to
expose transient, short-term changes in ﬁltering practices,
such as those that might occur around political events.
• Sound. The technique should avoid false positives and en-
sure that repeated measurements of the same phenomenon
produce the same outcome.
• Ethical. The system design must satisfy the ethical prin-
ciples from the Belmont [9] and Menlo [19] Reports:
respect for people, beneﬁcence, justice, and respect for
law and public interest.
We present a brief overview of the scanning method before
explaining how the approach satisﬁes the design goals above.

B. Approach
The strategy behind our method is to leverage the fact
that when an Internet host generates and sends IP packets,
each generated packet contains a 16-bit IP identiﬁer (“IP ID”)
value that is intended to assist endpoints in re-assembling
fragmented IPv4 packets. Although path MTU discovery now
largely obviates the need for IP fragmentation, senders still
generate packets with IP ID values. There are only 216 unique
IP ID values, but the intent is that subsequent packets from
the same host should have different IP ID values.
When an Internet host generates a packet, it must determine
an IP ID to use for that packet. Although different hosts on the
Internet use a variety of mechanisms to determine the IP ID
for each packet (e.g., random, counter-based increment per-
connection or per-interface), many hosts use a single global
counter to increment the IP ID value for all packets that
originate from that host, regardless of whether the packets
