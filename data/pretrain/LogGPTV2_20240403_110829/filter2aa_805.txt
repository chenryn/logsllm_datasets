11
Radar
Works in low light & poor weather, but lower resolution.
Ultrasound
Limited to proximity, low speed manoeuvres.
Camera
Senses reflected light,
limited when dark.
Sees colour, so can be 
used to read signs, 
signals, etc.
LiDAR
Emits light, so darkness not an issue.
Some weather limitation.
