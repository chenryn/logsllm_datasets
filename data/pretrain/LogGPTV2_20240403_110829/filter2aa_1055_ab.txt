### The Carding Business and Related Cybercrime Activities

#### Identity Theft and Small Transactions
- **Legitimate companies** typically do not accept credit card (CC) orders and are often unaware of identity theft targeting their business.
- **Small transactions**: Criminals make numerous small purchases just under the floor limit using stolen credit cards.
- **Funds transfer**: The stolen funds are then forwarded to accounts controlled by the crime ring.

#### Money Laundering via Online Auctions
- **Triangulation method**: 
  - Advertise a new $1000 digital camera on eBay for $800.
  - Purchase the item with a stolen credit card and have it sent to the buyer.
  - Collect $800 in cash, effectively laundering the money.

#### Manipulating Trust Rating Systems
- **Bot-driven cliques**:
  - Set up multiple accounts.
  - Sell zero-value items (e.g., background GIFs for web pages) for 1 cent each.
  - Provide positive feedback for each sale.
  - Offer 100 positive feedbacks for $1, monetizing trust similar to business goodwill.

#### Monetizing Accounts
- **Obvious accounts**: Banks, PayPal, etc.
- **Less obvious accounts**: Stock brokerage accounts.
  - Dump the existing portfolio.
  - Buy microcap stocks to drive up prices in a pump-and-dump scheme.
  - This eliminates the need to pump the stock manually.

#### Botnets and Click Fraud
- **No accounts at all**: Botnets used for click fraud.
  - Advertisers value clicks as they provide feedback on ad effectiveness.
  - Researchers estimate that 10-15% of clicks are fraudulent, representing approximately $1 billion in billings.
  - Google and other platforms boost revenue by recycling ads to other sites.
  - PTC/PTR (pay-to-click/pay-to-read) rings or clickbots fill sites with clicks.
  - Brokers like adspacedepot.com, clicksmania.net, clixmedia.biz, paid4clixonline.com, and puppiesptr.com facilitate these activities.

#### Money Laundering Legislation
- **US Money Laundering Enabling Act (2006)**:
  - An amendment to the Safe Port Act bans financial transactions to gambling sites.
  - Gambling continues but through illegitimate channels.
  - All gamblers become potential money launderers.
  - This significantly increases the noise level of money laundering, making it easier for fraud-related laundering to hide.

### Spam Technical Mechanisms

#### Bulletproof Hosting
- **Spam hosting**:
  - Available from $20 per month, and fraud hosting from $30 per month.
  - Significant numbers of spam servers are located in China due to its advanced telecom infrastructure and cheaper bandwidth.
  - China has 30-50,000 Internet police in 700 cities, but they focus on threats like pro-democracy web pages rather than spam.

#### Blocking IP Addresses
- **Experiment in blocking IP addresses**:
  - Resulted in blocking several Chinese networks, including those in Anhui, Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Hangzhou, Hubei, Jiangmen, and Shanghai.

#### Spammers' Tactics
- **Spammers can operate freely**:
  - Lack of government pressure and state-owned entities like China Telecom allow spammers to act without consequences.

#### BGP Route Injection and AS Hijacking
- **Steal an IP block**:
  - Break into a poorly-secured router.
  - Send a BGP route update announcing control over a currently-unused block of IP addresses.
  - Spam from each IP address until blacklisted.

- **Advertise a huge netblock**:
  - More specific prefixes (e.g., /24) will not be affected.
  - Attacker gets the remaining unallocated or unused space.
- **Advertise a legitimate netblock**:
  - Routers who don't know or care will believe it.
  - Easy to spot, low payoff, but also low cost.

#### Compromised Systems
- **Costs**:
  - Cisco router: $5.
  - Unix box: $1-5.
  - Windows box: Too cheap to meter.
- **Statistics**:
  - Two-thirds of blocked spam comes from infected PCs.
  - Many spam IPs come from ADSL/cable modem pools.
  - Over 350,000 compromised hosts on the US RoadRunner network alone.

#### Botnets
- **IRC-based botnet**:
  - Communications may be encrypted (SSL) and use covert channels like DNS TXT records and HTTP.
- **P2P-based botnet**:
  - More damage-resistant than centralized IRC control.
  - Evolves similarly to file-sharing networks, providing decentralized control.

#### Agobot and Spybot
- **Agobot**:
  - Modular, cross-platform, and GPL-licensed.
  - Capabilities include packet sniffing, rootkit functions, keylogging, and more.
  - Commands for spamming, DDoS, and system manipulation.
- **Spybot**:
  - Oriented towards spying and system manipulation.
  - Commands for retrieving passwords, killing processes, and simulating keypresses.

#### Worms and Spamware
- **Worms install spamware**:
  - Examples include SoBig, which affects 80-100,000 new PCs weekly.
  - Functions include SMTP proxy, SOCKS proxy, email harvesting, and DDoS attacks.
- **Special-purpose spam relays**:
  - Worms like MyDoom infect large numbers of PCs, which are then traded in spammer forums.
  - Infected PCs send spam directly or via ISP mail servers.

#### Malware Functions
- **Disable security software**:
  - Disable anti-virus/firewall software.
  - Bypass firewall software by patching NDIS.SYS.
- **Modify anti-virus databases**:
  - Remove detection of malware or delete database files.
- **Re-enable unsafe defaults**:
  - Lower browser security settings, re-enable unsafe features in MS Office.
- **Resuscitators and error-correcting codes**:
  - Resurrect each other if one is killed.
  - Repair the virus body if any portion is patched out.

#### Other Malware Functions
- **Infect through CRC32-checksummed files**:
  - Modify files without affecting their CRC32 value.
- **Install rogue CA root certificates**:
  - Usurp any SSL site due to the browser certificate trust model.
- **Engage users in IM chat sessions**:
  - Invite users to download malware, often masquerading as non-malicious content.
- **Steal authentication data**:
  - Hook into the JavaScript engine to grab AJAX-based data.
  - Register as a Winsock LSP to bypass SSL.
