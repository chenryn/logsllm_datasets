User: if i want to script a mini-application (in the Terminal) in mac and windows, which one is preferred: ruby or python?
or is there no major difference just a matter of taste?
cause i know python definetely is a good scripting language.
thanks
Assistant: Personally, I find the documentation for Python is much better than that for Ruby. The Docs for Ruby are full of cryptic examples that are terse, short, and just not very helpful.
On the other hand, docs for Python exist everywhere, but more importantly, in a useful, helpful form.
