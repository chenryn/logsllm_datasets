place much of the long-haul ﬁber-optic infrastructure along
railways and roadways [36].
8 Summary and Future Work
In this paper we study the Internet’s long-haul ﬁber-optic in-
frastructure in the US. Our ﬁrst contribution is in building a
ﬁrst-of-its-kind map of long-haul infrastructure using openly
available maps from tier-1 ISPs and cable providers. We val-
idate the map rigorously by appealing to public information
sources such as government agency ﬁlings, environmental
impact statements, press releases, and others. Examination
of the map conﬁrms the close correspondence of ﬁber de-
ployments and road/rail infrastructure and reveals signiﬁcant
link sharing among providers. Our second contribution is to
apply different metrics to examine the issue of shared risk
in the long-haul map. Our results point to high-risk links
where there are signiﬁcant levels of sharing among service
providers. Our ﬁnal contribution is to identify public ROWs
that could be targets for new link conduits that would reduce
shared risk and improve path performance. We discuss im-
plications of our ﬁndings in general and point out how they
expand the current discussion on how Title II and net neu-
trality.
In future work, we plan to appeal to regional and
metro ﬁber maps to improve the coverage of the long-haul
map and to continue the process of link validation. We also
plan to generate annotated versions of our map, focusing in
particular on trafﬁc and propagation delay.
