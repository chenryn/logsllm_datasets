User: How to set up scheduled tasks to execute scripts on Linux?
Assistant: 1. Use Cron Cron is a tool for regularly executing tasks in Linux systems. The following are the steps to create a crontab using Cron: 1. Open the terminal 2. Enter the command sudo crontab -e 3. Enter the crontab configuration in the pop-up text editor, each line represents a task configuration. For example: ``` * * * * * /root/myscript.sh ``` This configuration means to run /root/myscript.sh once every minute. The format of task configuration is: ``` * * * * * command to be executed - - - - - | | | | | | | | | | +----- day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday= 0) | | | +------- month (1 - 12) | | +--------- day of the month (1 - 31) | +------- --- hour (0 - 23) +------------- min (0 - 59) ``` The * sign indicates that there is no limit for each time period. For example, \* \* \* \* \* means execute the command every minute. 4. Write the script file and save it under the path specified in the configuration. 5. Save and exit the text editor. Enter the command sudo service cron restart to restart the Cron service for the new configuration to take effect. 2. Using Systemd Timers Systemd is an initialization system and system manager for Linux systems. The following are the steps to create a scheduled task using the Systemd timer: 1. Open the terminal 2. Enter the command sudo systemctl edit --force --full myscript.timer 3. Enter the configuration of the scheduled task in the pop-up text editor. Here is an example: ``` [Unit] Description=Run myscript every hour [Timer] OnUnitActiveSec=1h Unit=myscript.service [Install] WantedBy=timers.target ``` This configuration means to run myscript.service every hour . Among them, OnUnitActiveSec indicates how long to wait to start the service after the timer is activated. Unit represents the service to start. 4. Write the script file and save it under the path specified in the Service configuration. 5. Save and exit the text editor. Enter the command sudo systemctl daemon-reload to reload the Systemd configuration. Enter the command sudo systemctl enable myscript.timer to enable the timer. Note: Two files need to be manipulated to use Systemd timer: .timer and .service files. The timer is responsible for starting the service, and the service file contains the script or command to be executed.
