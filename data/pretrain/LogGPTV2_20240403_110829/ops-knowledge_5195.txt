User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer SDKs and connectors:
How can I improve ingestion with SDKs?

Assistant: When ingesting via SDK, you can use the ingestion [batching policy settings to improve performance](../../net-sdk-ingest-data.md). 
Try incrementally decreasing the size of data ingested in the table or database batching policy down towards 250 MB and check if there is an improvement.
