In Angular1 when we have ng-model="obj.prop" and if obj does not exist, It
will not throw any error. If user type anything on that input new obj Object
created with prop.
However, In Angular 2 when we pass undefined object from parent to child
component as @input and use as [(ngModel)]="obj.prop", If obj is defined in
parent it works and even sync data with parent component. But, if it is not
defined there it give an error : "Cannot read property 'prop' of undefined"
If I use elvis operator as [ngModel]="field?.value" (ngModelChange)="field ?
field.value = $event : null" It eliminate error but then it does not sync with
parent component.
We are using this as part of dynamic component. And we does not know if that
object is defined or not. If not it should be like it does in Angular 1.
