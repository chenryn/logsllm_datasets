that this domain does not support DKIM at all, and no DKIM
verification can be performed. This attack vector does not
target the DKIM verification itself, but the problem that a
client cannot verify if the sending domain does not imple-
ment DKIM or an attacker just removed the DKIM headers.
The described attack vector applies to all domains imple-
menting DKIM without DMARC. This brings us to the third
research question: what does the adoption of DMARC looks
like overall?
4 DATA GATHERING AND
MEASUREMENT SETUP
To obtain a general picture of the adoption states and their de-
velopment, we performed a one and a half year long measure-
ment study. More specifically, we measured the described
DNS-based techniques from Section 2 on a large scale, pur-
suing two distinct data gathering approaches:
(1) We implemented a DNS crawler that collects and stores
the matching TXT records for SPF and DMARC once
a month.
(2) By analyzing email dumps, we learned common pat-
terns of selectors of DKIM keys, and subsequently
applied these to generate a list of selectors with which
we can request as many DKIM keys as possible.
4.1 Data Sets
For our data collection, we need domain lists for extracting
the DNS information regarding mail authentication methods
that are as consistent and broad as possible. According to
Scheitle et al. [34], individual top lists fluctuate and may
bias results. Thus, we consider a fixed list of domains for
each analyzed top list. Previous works usually use the Alexa
top 1 million list as basis for further analysis [2, 17, 33, 34].
In addition, other papers use the Majestics top list [5, 27].
Moreover, since February 2019, a third list combining several
lists called Tranco was published [25]. In our work, we use
all three top lists to be as comparable as possible with other
measurement studies and to provide an as complete survey
as possible since different top lists include different domains.
There are only 214,015 common domains in all three top
lists, thus, the intersection is comparatively small due to
the significant differences in the methods used to create
the different lists. Altogether, we consider 2,039,279 unique
domains in the union of all lists. We analyzed monthly snap-
shots of the Majestics list from December 2018 to May 2020;
for the Alexa list we collected snapshots from December 2018
to May 2020, and for the Tranco list, we have snapshots from
March 2019 to May 2020. (Note: The scan from January 2020
is unfortunately unusable because we had memory problems.
It is not included in all following analyses.) The data was
collected periodically once a month and is available after
publication, including the crawler implementation.
4.2 Data Crawlers
In case of SPF and DMARC, we implemented a crawler to
gather DNS TXT records for a list of domains and save them
for later analysis. Data collection for DKIM is not as easy
since to collect the keys, we have to know the key selector
string. For this reason, we analyzed several email dumps
and subsequently generated a preferably complete list of
357The Evolution of DNS-based Email Authentication:
Measuring Adoption and Finding Flaws
valid selectors. We tested this list for all domains and col-
lected corresponding DKIM keys and saved them for further
analysis.
SPF and DMARC. The SPF and DMARC information
4.2.1
is stored in DNS TXT records and must start with a valid ver-
sion tag. In case of SPF, this is v=spf1 and in case of DMARC,
this is v=DMARC1. If no DNS TXT record starts with a valid
version tag, this means that the method is not implemented
for the given domain.
With SPF records, we have to check for the include or
redirect mechanisms, as we have to collect all domains to get
a complete SPF record.
4.2.2 DKIM. For gathering DKIM keys, we need the DKIM
key selector string. This selector is not public and not a
fixed string, it can vary depending on the domain. The only
way to obtain a selector for a domain is to receive an email
with a valid DKIM signature. To address this problem, we
collect selectors from email dumps. For this, we examined
the Linux kernel mail archive from the introduction of DKIM
in 2011 until the end of 2018 (2018/12/22) with about one
million emails. A potential limitation regarding this email
dump is that these emails might not be representative for
all emails. But this is not a big deal, as there might even be
more technical or even security-savvy people sending emails,
the number of identifiable selectors is maybe even higher.
However, in addition, we included a private GMX and Gmail
account from one of the authors with about 7,000 received
emails from 2014/11/16 to 2018/12/06 in the analysis. From
all analyzed emails, around 35% contained a DKIM signature
header. Although a selector can be randomly selected, we
noticed that most selectors are built based on certain patterns,
such as a date or a fixed string like selector1, default, or mail.
After analyzing the dumps and having a sense for the
structure of various selectors, we generated a list with 3,498
possible selector strings in a second step. To review our
generated list, we analyzed a spam email archive, including
more than one million emails. We use this selector list to find
as many valid DKIM records as possible from the examined
domain lists. Note that completely random selectors cannot
be identified with this method. As a result, we can identify
only a lower bound for the use of DKIM in the wild. Note
that we provide the script for collecting the selectors of
the Linux kernel mail archive, but unfortunately the private
email accounts represent data we cannot share. However, the
resulting list of selectors will be provided for reproducibility.

5 MEASUREMENT RESULTS
5.1 SPF Measurements
5.1.1 Adoption Rates. To obtain a long-term overview, we
included the results from previous work as comparative val-
ues [11, 13, 19]. We find that the adoption rate of SPF is
slowly, continuously rising on all domain lists; nowadays
up to 50.7% of the examined domains implement SPF. Note
that the comparison with previous work has the limitation
that not the same set of domains were checked, but it is
enough to obtain a broad overview and feeling for the over-
all adoption rates and their evolution. In total, we find that
the general adoption rate increased by around 25% since
2015, but remains just around half of the examined domains.
Next, we are interested in the adoption rate for higher-
ranked, more popular domains. We suspect that higher-ranked
domains are potentially better maintained as they would
have the economic incentive to defend against spoofing that
hurts their brand, or phishing that targets their customers
and therefore more likely to use security mechanisms like
SPF. The top 100 domains of Majestics, Alexa, and Tranco
show a higher rate of SPF usage (up to 90%) compared to the
rest of the top 1 million domains, validating our assumption.
Moreover, no further changes are visible in this cases, but
it seems to remain stable for all lists. For the Alexa list, on
average 88 of the top 100 domains implement SPF. The re-
maining domains that have not implemented SPF include,
e.g., cnblogs.com, office.com, and xinhuanet.com. It might be
surprising that the top-ranked domain office.com owned by
Microsoft has not implemented SPF. One primary reason is
likely that the domain does not operate an email server and
has published a DMARC record, so an attacker cannot easily
abuse this domain for spoofing.
We found that 12 out of 88 domains published an in-
valid SPF record (see Table 1 for details). It is surprising
that amazon.co.jp and imgur.com use an SPF record where a
non-existing DNS TXT record is used as the include mecha-
nism. The inclusion of invalid or non-existing SPF records
always leads to a permerror. Both domains have implemented
DMARC, so the domains are protected, however, the incor-
rect SPF record can also lead to a rejection of an email if the
DKIM signature is not present or also incorrect. The domains
espn.com and wiki.com have another issue: they exceeded the
number of total DNS lookups. According to RFC 7208 [20],
the SPF implementations must limit the total number of DNS
queries to 10, and if this value is exceeded, the validation
must return a permerror.
For the top 1,000 domains, the adoption rate is still high
with on average 74% for Alexa, 69% for Majestics, and 77% for
Tranco. If we compare these values with the top 10,000 do-
mains, we can see that the adoption rate is somewhat stable

and decreased only to around 62% for Alexa, 65% for Majes-
tics, and 67% for Tranco. This indicates that higher ranked
domains, which are mostly operated by larger organizations,
seem to take the security issue of spoofing more serious than
smaller organizations with lower ranked domain names. It
should be noted that known domains are probably more
likely to be spoofed than unknown ones. However, this does
not apply to all highly ranked domains, as multiple domains
still do not implement SPF.
Further analyses, e.g. on the distribution of SPF on servers
with or without MX records, or the detailed distributions
for the higher-ranked domains, are excluded due to space
reasons.
5.1.2 Trend Analysis. In a first step, we performed the trend
analysis by plotting the measured values as a linear trend
function. For the Alexa top list, we calculated a rise of about
m = 1754.3 per month (Tranco: m = 653.4, Majestics: m =
280.74).
To confirm that our measured values represent a signifi-
cant increase over time, we performed a t-test (paired two
samples for means). Our null hypothesis is that there was no
relevant increase in use since the beginning and the end of
our measurement period. We used the measurements from
December 2018 to March 2019 (first measuring points) and
the last measurements from February 2020 to May 2020 (last
measuring points) as input for our t-test.
The p-value is < 0.05 and thus the null hypothesis is
rejected. There is a significant difference between the aver-
age values at the beginning and at the end. Thus, the use
of SPF has increased significantly in course of one year. If
we look at the valid SPF records in the next step, we see

the same situation, i.e., a significant increase in valid SPF
records (p-value ≈ 0.002). In case of invalid SPF records, we
also find a significant difference between the first and last
measurement points (p-value ≈ 0.008), but at this point we
observe a significant decrease (mean of start and end values:
[78977.5, 74583.5]). We calculated all the t-tests also for the
other two lists (Majestics and Tranco). For both lists, we ob-
tained similar results, i.e., we observe a significant difference
(increase for valid and decrease for invalid SPF records).
5.1.3 Policies and Content. Next, we consider the actual
content of the SPF records. We compare the number of valid
SPF records (including their corresponding SPF policy) and
the number of invalid SPF records over time from all datasets.
(see Table 2 for details on numbers from related work [11],
the first, and the last snapshots exemplary for the Alexa
domain list). We find that most of the SPF records are valid.
However, about 77,000 records contain invalid configurations
across all measurement points in case of Alexa (67,000 in case
of Majestics, 75,000 in case of Tranco). The numbers decrease
slightly over the measurements, which is remarkable since
there is an overall increase in total SPF records. The most
common reason for invalidating a record was caused by
exceeding the allowed number of DNS requests. As noted,
this is limited according to RFC 7208 [20] to a maximum
of ten lookups and it leads to a permerror SPF verification
result. Almost half of the invalid domains belong to this
category. Another widespread issue with about 24% of the
invalid records was the implementation of multiple records.
A domain that publishes multiple SPF records including an
obsolete SPF record will cause that the records will be invalid
and no SPF verification can be performed.
It is not surprising that valid SPF records are continuously
increasing over time as the total amount of SPF records in-
creases. The number of valid SPF records grew from 401,356
domains at the first snapshot to more than 500,000 in May
2020 (+25%). Almost half of the domains with a valid SPF
359The Evolution of DNS-based Email Authentication:
Measuring Adoption and Finding Flaws
record implemented the soft fail policy and the number is con-
tinuously rising. The hard fail policy, which is the strictest
option of all the possible options, is adopted by maximum
33.1% of the valid SPF domains. The neutral policy is used by
around 10% of all valid SPF record and is minimally decreas-
ing over time. Interestingly, the adoption rate for the pass
policy is first increasing between the snapshots 12/2018 and
01/2019 and afterwards decreasing. This behavior demon-
strates that most of the domains that recently implemented
SPF tend to use more strict policies like hard fail or soft fail.
Both policy modes are recommended as they either com-
pletely block unauthorized IP addresses or mark them as
untrustworthy. A positive aspect is a minimal decrease in
the pass policy. This policy does not improve the security in
any way, as every message will pass the validation process
of SPF.
5.2 Graph-based SPF Analysis
To gain deeper insights into the use of SPF, we analyze the re-
lationships between SPF entries. This analysis is based on the
snapshot from April 2019 for the Alexa list. In particular, we
examined two different aspects: (1) relation between domains
and their include records and (2) relation between IP address
and Autonomous System (AS). In total, these results demon-
strate that there is a small number of SPF include records
or AS that are trusted by a large number of domains. Espe-
cially the two companies Google and Microsoft are among
the most commonly used SPF include records, which means
that many parties use services in those domains to send as
if they were sending from those parties: almost every fifth
domain with a valid SPF record included an SPF record of
these two companies. However, also the SPF records of other
