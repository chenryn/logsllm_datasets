### Documentation linking to existing examples?
I'm slowly working on some of the documentation and I'm trying to figure out
how to add some examples here and there in the docs. I'd like to not duplicate
work that's already been done. I believe I will link to examples using
relative links where they are pertinent in the API. I don't believe I've seen
that done yet. It might be nice to also link to handy external examples.
### Embedded live examples
I'm not sure I'm going to go this next route, but I was wondering if inline
examples would be completely out of the question. Specifically some tweakable
examples with the various mesh materials I believe would be quite helpful.
### /src code vs /examples code
My next question is regarding the examples code base vs. the src code base.
What's the reasoning behind the split between some of the code? A lot of the
code in examples is quite handy and I feel like it should be documented.
There's no structure in place for that as of yet.
