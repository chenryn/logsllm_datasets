### Network Capacity and Buffering

The downlink typically has a higher capacity than the uplink, resulting in lower buffering on the ISP side. The home network, which is usually provisioned with at least 10 Mbits/s, is also better equipped than the downlink, leading to minimal buffering in the modem for downstream traffic. The high variability in latency under load can be attributed to the variety of service plans. For example, AT&T offers DSL plans ranging from 768 Kbits/s to 6 Mbits/s, UVerse plans up to 18 Mbits/s, and upstream speeds from 128 Kbits/s to over 1 Mbit/s. In contrast, Comcast offers fewer service plans, making it easier to design devices that work well across all plans.

### Modem Buffering and Latency Under Load

To investigate the effects of modem buffers on latency under load, we conducted tests using BISMark on AT&T and Comcast modems. We tested the best AT&T DSL plan (6 Mbits/s down, 512 Kbits/s up) and the best Comcast plan (12.5 Mbits/s down, 2 Mbits/s up). Our experiment involved starting an ICMP ping (at 10 pkts/s for Comcast and 2 pkts/s for AT&T, as some modems block higher rates) to the last mile hop. After 30 seconds, we flooded the uplink (1 Mbits/s for AT&T and 10 Mbits/s for Comcast using iperf UDP). After 60 seconds, we stopped iperf but continued the ping for another 30 seconds. The ping measurements 30 seconds before and after the iperf test established the baseline latency.

We used brand new Motorola and 2Wire modems, and a 5-year-old Westell modem. The same Westell modem was observed in two other homes in the BISMark deployment.

**Results:**
- **Latency Increase:** In all cases, latency increased dramatically at the start of flooding and plateaued when the buffer was saturated.
- **Buffer Sizes:** The 2Wire modem had the lowest worst-case latency (800 ms), followed by the Motorola modem (1600 ms), and the Westell modem (over 10 seconds).
- **Emulation:** We emulated this setup in Emulab with a 2 end-host, 1-router graph, configuring a token bucket filter using tc. The buffer sizes were calculated as 512 Kbits/s × max(latency of modem), yielding 640 Kbytes for Westell, 100 Kbytes for Motorola, and 55 Kbytes for 2Wire. This setup closely matched the actual modems' latency profiles. We found that buffer sizes exceeding 20 KBytes for a 512 Kbits/s uplink did little for throughput but caused a linear increase in latency under load.

### PowerBoost Traffic Shaping and Latency

To understand the impact of PowerBoost traffic shaping on latency, we studied Comcast users from BISMark. All modems had buffers inducing less than one second of delay, but users experienced significant latency under load due to traffic shaping. 

**Results:**
- **D-LINK User:** Saw a jump in latency when flooding began and another increase about 8 seconds later.
- **Thomson User:** Experienced an initial increase in latency when flooding started, followed by a decrease after about 20 seconds. The initial effect is consistent with buffering and PowerBoost, where packets see lower latencies during PowerBoost due to the inverse relationship between latency and draining rate. The Thomson user's decrease in latency cannot be explained by the same mechanism. The loss rate for the Thomson modem was low for about 20 seconds after the link was saturated, followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the drop in latency.

### Data Transfer Modification for Improved Latency

We explored whether modifying data transfer behavior could improve coexistence between large "bulk" flows and delay-sensitive flows. We compared the impact of a 50 MB download on a G.711 VoIP call under three conditions:
1. No traffic control.
2. Intermittent traffic at capacity with a 10.8-second ON and 5.3-second OFF cycle.
3. Shaping using the WonderShaper approach.

**Results:**
- **No Traffic Control:** The transfer took 25.3 seconds, but the VoIP call suffered high latency and loss after the PowerBoost period.
- **Intermittent Traffic:** The download took 26.9 seconds without significantly increasing latency.
- **WonderShaper:** The download took 32.2 seconds, also without significantly increasing latency. Both intermittent traffic and WonderShaper approaches achieved similar long-term rates but provided significant latency benefits.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Continual Measurements:** Continuous measurements directly from home network gateways are crucial for understanding access network performance. Existing speed tests often do not reflect performance over extended periods and neglect various confounding factors.
2. **ISP Policies and Performance:** Different ISPs use varying policies and traffic shaping behaviors, making it difficult to compare performance. Developing a benchmarking suite that users can understand is critical.
3. **User Preferences and ISP Performance:** There is no "best" ISP for all users. Different users may prefer different ISPs based on their usage profiles and performance needs.
4. **Home Network Equipment:** Home network infrastructure, including modems, can significantly affect performance. More research is needed to understand the characteristics of traffic inside the home and its impact on performance.
