Fast  Abstracts  are  brief  two  page  presentations  of  a  research  idea,  an  opinion,  or  a 
project  update.  They  cover  a  wide  variety  of  issues  within  the  field  of  dependable 
systems and networks. They are also designed to offer an opportunity for late-breaking 
results, partial results, or work in progress to be reported in a timely fashion. As such, 
they are lightly screened by the Fast Abstracts Program Committee and are not subject 
to the rigorous referee process of regular DSN papers. The late submission deadline and 
expedited screening, along with the corresponding 5-minute talk during DSN, allow for 
very rapid dissemination and timely feedback from the community. 
This  year’s  program  features  25  papers  from  university  and  company  scholars  and 
researchers  spanning  11  countries.  We  are  particularly  pleased  to  have  presentations 
from scientists and engineers from industry. Their contribution mirrors the goal of Fast 
Abstracts to provide a greater diversity of participation and corresponding exchange of 
ideas than is possible with regular presentation alone.
We hope that this year’s presentations stimulate much thought and cross-pollination and 
make the exchange experience enjoyable.
