**Fast Abstracts**

Fast Abstracts are concise, two-page presentations that can encompass a research idea, an opinion, or a project update. They cover a wide range of topics within the field of dependable systems and networks. Fast Abstracts are designed to provide an opportunity for the timely reporting of late-breaking results, partial results, or work in progress. Unlike regular DSN papers, which undergo a rigorous peer-review process, Fast Abstracts are lightly screened by the Fast Abstracts Program Committee. The expedited screening, coupled with a late submission deadline, allows for rapid dissemination and timely feedback from the community. Additionally, each Fast Abstract is accompanied by a 5-minute presentation during the DSN conference.

This year’s program includes 25 contributions from scholars and researchers at universities and companies across 11 countries. We are especially pleased to feature presentations from scientists and engineers in industry, as their participation aligns with the goal of Fast Abstracts to foster a diverse exchange of ideas and broader participation than is possible with traditional paper presentations alone.

We hope that this year’s Fast Abstracts will stimulate thoughtful discussions, encourage cross-pollination of ideas, and make the overall exchange experience enjoyable for all participants.
