Abstract
Recently developed techniques have been very success-
ful in accurately estimating intra-Autonomous System (AS)
trafﬁc matrices. These techniques rely on link measure-
ments, ﬂow measurements, or routing-related data to infer
trafﬁc demand between every pair of ingress-egress points
of an AS. They also illustrate an inherent mismatch be-
tween data needed (e.g., ingress-egress demand) and data
most readily available (e.g., link measurements). This mis-
match is exacerbated when we try to estimate inter-AS traf-
ﬁc matrices, i.e., snapshots of Internet-wide trafﬁc behavior
over coarse time scale (a week or longer) between ASs. We
present a method for modeling inter-AS trafﬁc demand that
relies exclusively on publicly available/obtainable mea-
surements. We ﬁrst perform extensive Internet-wide mea-
surement experiments to infer the “business rationale” of
individual ASs. We then use these business proﬁles to char-
acterize individual ASs, classifying them by their “utility”
into ASs providing Web hosting, residential access, and
business access. We rank ASs by their utilities which drive
our gravity-model based approach for generating inter-AS
trafﬁc demand. In a ﬁrst attempt to validate our methodol-
ogy, we test our inter-AS trafﬁc generation method on an
inferred Internet AS graph and present some preliminary
ﬁndings about the resulting inter-AS trafﬁc matrices.
1 Introduction
Motivated by recent successes of intra-domain trafﬁc ma-
trix estimation techniques [8, 23, 16], we attempt to obtain
accurate estimates of trafﬁc volume exchanged between in-
dividual ASs. Knowledge of such a global but coarse-scale
spatio-temporal picture of Internet trafﬁc is vital for a num-
ber of practical networking problems, including evaluating

the impact of emerging technologies such as “intelligent
routing control” (e.g., multi-homing, overlay routing) [3];
identifying or forecasting potential network bottlenecks or
investigating the effectiveness of proposed remedies aimed
at alleviating growing congestion [2]; assessing the perfor-
mance of new protocols or Internet-wide applications such
as new overlay networks; or improving the current under-
standing of how intra-domain trafﬁc engineering (TE) im-
pacts inter-domain TE and vice versa [1, 15, 14]. In the
spirit of the work by Feldman et al. [9], we can use these
inter-domain trafﬁc matrices to partially answer such ques-
tions as “How stable are AS trafﬁc volumes over time?” or
“Which ASs carry most of the trafﬁc, and how much?”
Given the highly competitive nature of today’s Internet
Service Provider (ISP) market, ISPs do not make public
such sensitive data as trafﬁc volume statistics. The task
of capturing the global behavior of AS-level Internet over
long time scale (e.g., days) has been left to experimen-
talists. Due to the immense difﬁculties in collecting high
volume of trafﬁc data on an Internet-wide scale, research
efforts to model and estimate inter-domain trafﬁc demand
are still in their infancy. With some exceptions [6, 22, 9],
most studies that require knowledge of inter-domain trafﬁc
demand typically employ extremely simple (and untested)
demand models, often assuming uniform trafﬁc demand
between every pair of ASs [2, 21]. Studies that rely on
traces collected from a single vantage point (typically lo-
cated in some stub network) are inherently constrained in
their ability to provide a global view of inter-domain traf-
ﬁc. Nevertheless, an analysis of these traces revealed that
while any given AS may exchange trafﬁc with most of the
Internet, only a small number of ASs are responsible for a
large fraction of inter-domain trafﬁc. In contrast to [6, 22],
Feldmann et al. [9] also use server logs from a large CDN
and develop a methodology for estimating inter-domain de-
mand matrices for Web trafﬁc.
Our model of inter-domain trafﬁc demand encompasses
the overall trafﬁc, with Web trafﬁc representing just one
(though quite signiﬁcant) component. Considering the

highly restrictive nature of access to proprietary data (such
as server logs of large CDNs), we rely only on pub-
licly available or obtainable data in our modeling of inter-
domain trafﬁc demand. However, the proposed approach
is ﬂexible enough to incorporate proprietary data, should it
become available and should it be relevant to the problem at
hand. In addition, we argue that a useful inter-domain traf-
ﬁc demand model should possess the following two char-
acteristics. First, given the challenging task of obtaining
actual inter-domain trafﬁc matrices, the model should be
ﬂexible enough to allow for a systematic exploration of dif-
ferent trafﬁc scenarios and trafﬁc engineering strategies. At
the same time, the model should be parsimonious enough
to provide an intuitive understanding of the generated traf-
ﬁc demand and allow for a network-grounded interpreta-
tion of its parameters.
Our approach to develop such a model is partly empiri-
cal and partly analytical. We combine information gained
from performing extensive Internet-wide measurement ex-
periments with a modeling framework known as the “gen-
eral gravity model.” The general gravity model has recently
been used in estimating intra-domain trafﬁc matrices [23]
and has a long history in the social sciences, where it has
been applied to describe the movement of people, goods,
and information between geographic regions [17, 7]. To
apply the gravity model to inter-domain trafﬁc modeling,
we ﬁrst need to deﬁne the concepts of “mass” and “dis-
tance” within the context of inter-domain trafﬁc exchange.
To that end, we start by discussing the business model (or
operational characteristics) of individual ASs.
In Section 2 we make the null hypothesis that to a ﬁrst
approximation, the trafﬁc volume exchanged between two
ASs necessarily reﬂects the business model of their opera-
tors. For example, an AS in the business of hosting various
web and multimedia content will exhibit a very lopsided
trafﬁc proﬁle (i.e., disproportionately heavy outbound traf-
ﬁc volumes). For another example, if two ASs are mainly
in the business of providing access to residential customers,
with comparable customer bases, trafﬁc demand between
the two networks can be expected to be more symmetric.
By exploiting a range of publicly available data sets and
by relying on information collected from our own Internet-
wide experiments, we develop in Section 3 a combined
measurement and business “proﬁling” methodology to in-
fer the “utility” of an AS’s physical network. We identify
the utility of an AS as providing Web hosting, residential
access, or business access services. Depending on a sim-
ple high/low classiﬁcation of these utility values, we infer
seven natural AS business models. In Section 3, we classify
ASs into one of these models, and rank the ASs within each
class by their combined utility. These rankings then consti-
tute the key input data to our general gravity model pre-
sented in Section 5 and determine the generation of inter-
domain trafﬁc volumes exchanged between individual ASs.
In particular, we illustrate that our model, besides being
ﬂexible and parsimonious, is capable of generating realis-
tic trafﬁc demand with different characteristics. As a ﬁnal
contribution, we focus in Section 6 on model validation and
attempt to partially address this issue, even though inter-
domain trafﬁc matrix estimation is a case where even the
most basic “ground truth” appears elusive. We conclude in
Section 7 with a discussion of unresolved issues and open
problems.
2 AS Business Models
We broadly deﬁne an AS’s business model as the utility
of its physical networks, i.e., the primary reason(s) behind
the design, operation, and management of its physical in-
frastructure. We associate a “business model” with each
AS, not with each ISP or company, mainly because some
large ISPs maintain multiple ASs (or domains) and typi-
cally assign these (sub)domains to separate business divi-
sions, each with its own business characteristics or utility.
We avoid the daunting task of identifying and enumerating
the business purposes and operating strategies of all ASs
by restricting our attention to the most generic utilities of
existing networks that clearly affect their resulting trafﬁc
demand. In the following, we identify three such utilities
(i.e., Web hosting, residential access, and business access)
and describe how they can impact inter-domain trafﬁc de-
mand.
Web Hosting (Web). The success of the World Wide
Web has led to an explosion of web sites that host various
web content and streaming media. Powered by sophisti-
cated content distribution technologies, a number of Web
hosting companies have also emerged to host content out-
sourced by popular web sites. So much so that Web hosting
is now a common service included in an AS’s service port-
folio. An AS that hosts popular web content or e-commerce
engines and distributes this content to the global Internet
can be expected to carry voluminous outbound trafﬁc and
relatively little inbound trafﬁc.
Residential Access (RA). Retail Internet business that
directly deals with residential customers has existed since
the inception of the commercial Internet. With advances in
Internet access technologies, along with access speed, the
number of residential users equipped with Internet access
has risen steadily.1With the proliferation of high-speed In-
ternet users, the inﬂuence of end-user applications on the
global trafﬁc pattern becomes increasingly pronounced. A
prime example are the bandwidth-demanding peer-to-peer
(P2P) ﬁle-sharing applications. ASs populated by a large
pool of residential users can exchange nontrivial amount of
trafﬁc among themselves as well as receive a large amount
of web download trafﬁc from Web content networks.
Business Access (BA). The low barrier of entry into the
ISP market creates an environment whereby wholesaling
and reselling of Internet access is actively pursued by both

incumbent carriers and new market entrants. Customers
of large ISPs with nation- or continent-wide footprints are
often themselves ISPs that resell the purchased Internet ac-
cess to their own customers. For the purposes of this paper,
“business access providers” are ISPs that resell purchased
Internet access. Trafﬁc demand of ASs that are business
access providers can be estimated by the quality of service
these ASs provide. Transit ASs guaranteeing good quality
of service are likely to attract and retain a high number of
customers. In turn, customers with reliable Internet con-
nections can rely on the Internet for a large part of their
business transactions, resulting in high trafﬁc demand.
While the ﬁrst two of these three utilities are tradition-
ally attributed to stub networks, the third one is typically
associated with transit networks.
In today’s ISP market
the service portfolio of large ISPs typically reﬂect mul-
tiple concurrent utilities (e.g., a business access provider
may also be in the business of providing residential access
or Web hosting services). We therefore do not follow the
traditional classiﬁcation of ASs into stub and transit net-
works. Instead, we attempt to determine a given AS’s busi-
ness model by inferring from relevant data which of the
three utilities dominate the AS’s operation, and what com-
bination of utilities best characterizes the AS’s business.
Table 1 lists seven AS business proﬁles based on the three
identiﬁed utilities. Whether a given utility is primary or
secondary to an AS’s business proﬁle is denoted by “H”
(high) and “L” (low). We tag each of the seven business
proﬁles with an appropriately named business model listed
in the right column.
3 Method for Inferring AS Business Model
In the highly competitive ISP market, the business plans of
existing ISPs are generally conﬁdential and cannot be in-
spected. Commercial ISP market research studies, e.g., Pri-
Metrica (telegeography.com), are often dated, cover
only a handful of well-known ISPs, or are based on some
very narrowly-deﬁned criteria. They are in general ill-
suited for inferring business proﬁles of ASs, as deﬁned in
Table 1, in a comprehensive and coherent manner. As a
viable alternative, we propose a methodology for inferring
an AS’s business model that involves performing extensive
Internet-wide measurement experiments and also involves
collecting data indicative of individual ASs’ utilities. We

rely exclusively on publicly available/obtainable data and
assume that we have no access to any proprietary data. We
discuss the limitations imposed by this restriction and com-
ment on how they could be alleviated if different types of
proprietary data (e.g., server logs from a large CDN as used
by Feldman et al. [9]) should become available.
3.1 Web Hosting
Our approach to quantifying web service utility is based
on locating popular content on the Internet. ASs that host
a large amount of popular content are considered to have
high utility as a web service provider. To determine pop-
ular web content, we ﬁrst consulted the web site Aleksika
(www.skyart.org) and obtained a list of the top 10,000
search keywords most frequently submitted to search en-
gines in the years 2003-2004. For each keyword, we
queried the Google search engine, using the Google Web
Services Application Programmer Interface (API), to re-
trieve a set of most closely matched URLs. For each sub-
mitted query, the Google Web API returned the top-10
matched results (URLs). We collected about 85,000 dis-
tinct URLs from all Google responses. By extracting web
server addresses from these URLs, we inferred the ASs
hosting widely accessed web content. To prevent bias to-
wards discovering English-only content, we repeated the
above experiment six more times, directing the Google
Web Services API to return URLs in Chinese, French, Ger-
man, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish respectively. The
same set of English keywords was used in each experiment.
For each language, we obtained between 80,000 and 90,000
URLs for these keywords. Merging all these results yielded
close to 650,000 distinct URLs.
One source of web trafﬁc not captured by the above mea-
surement experiments is embedded web content, which in-
cludes media ﬁles delivered by dedicated media servers
secondary to a web server, private CDNs, or third-party on-
line advertisement objects (e.g., doubleclick.com).
To uncover such web trafﬁc, we crawled the above
keyword-retrieved URLs individually, and extracted from
the crawled pages URLs associated with embedded objects.
Combining keyword-retrieved URLs with embedded-
object URLs increased the total number of our collected
URLs by a factor of three.

Next we extracted a web server IP address from each
URL and mapped it to its corresponding AS. A num-
ber of issues complicated this seemingly straightforward
step. For one, some frequently-accessed web sites employ
DNS-based load balancing, whereby their domain names
are resolved to multiple addresses in a round-robin man-
ner.
In more sophisticated cases, a given domain name
is resolved to a set of addresses depending on the query-
ing client’s geographic location, web server availability,
and network condition. CNN and AOL are examples of
two content providers employing such DNS-based web re-
quest routing, and their domain names are typically re-
solved to hundreds of addresses spread out geographically
and administratively over the Internet. To obtain all IP
addresses associated with a given web server’s domain
name, we performed a reverse-DNS lookup of each do-
main name from 96 geographically dispersed PlanetLab
nodes (planet-lab.org), and collected all resulting
addresses. Using BGP routing tables, we then mapped each
resulting IP address to its corresponding AS. In Table 2, we
summarize the steps taken to obtain the web-hosting utility
Uweb(X) for every AS X, where Uweb(X) can be viewed
as an estimate of the byte counts of popular web content
hosted by AS X.
Finally, we sort the ASs by their utility Uweb(·) in de-
creasing order and assign them ranks, denoted Rweb(·). Ta-
ble 3 lists the top-10 Web hosting ASs by rank, in three dif-
ferent geographic regions: North America (ARIN), Europe
(RIPE) and Asia-Paciﬁc (APNIC). As expected, the top-
ranking Web hosting ASs include e-commerce companies
(e.g., Amazon and eBay), telecom companies (e.g., AT&T,
Deutsche Telekom, Korea Telecom), and well-known por-
tal sites (e.g., Yahoo). One notable observation is the dom-
inance of telecom companies in the Web hosting business
in the Asia-Paciﬁc region.
Fig. 1 shows the entire Rweb vs. Uweb distribution. Con-
sistent with previous ﬁndings [6, 22, 9], Uweb(·) associated
with high-ranking ASs (e.g., up to rank 100 − 400) in all
three geographic regions are characterized by a Zipf-type
law (i.e., Uweb ∼ (Rweb)c, where c ≈ −0.9 for ARIN and
