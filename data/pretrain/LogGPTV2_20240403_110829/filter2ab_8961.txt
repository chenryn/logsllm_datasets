**ATT&CK ID:** S0651  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** BoxCaon

**Description:**
BoxCaon achieves persistence by modifying the Windows Registry. Specifically, it sets the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load` registry key to point to its executable.[6]

This method ensures that the malware is executed each time the user logs in, thereby maintaining a persistent presence on the system.
