User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is a new SID applied when sysprep-ping a Windows image or when deploying? My organisation currently has Windows XP (yes, I know official support for it ceases in less than 24 hours) and Windows 7 system images made with Symantec Ghost 11 that we routinely deploy to machines. A required step after deployment is to run NewSID to apply a new SID to the system. Obviously a potentially better way would be to use sysprep to make the images in the first place.

I've been reading about sysprep for both Windows XP and 7, and I see that a new SID is created at some point if you use the "/generalize" command line option. What I'd like to confirm is: Is the new SID applied to a system after deployment, i.e. if I deploy and start the image on 10 machines they will get 10 different SIDs? Also, is this true for both Windows XP and Windows 7?

Lastly, I've also read (but can't fully understand) that there are "different" kinds of SIDs. So is a new SID applied via NewSID the same as that by sysprep?

Thank you in advance for your answers.

  /generalize    Prepares the Windows installation to be imaged. If this
  option is specified, all unique system information is removed from the
  Windows installation. The security ID (SID) resets, any system restore
  points are cleared, and event logs are deleted.
  
  The next time the computer starts, the specialize configuration pass
  runs. A new security ID (SID) is created, and the clock for Windows
  activation resets, if the clock has not already been reset three
  times.


This means on the next reboot (after deployment!) your SID will reset.
Your machines will get 10 different SID's, yes.

There are multiple kinds of SID's.
Users have SID's, Machine's have SID's, there are local SID's, Domain SID's, and there are "special" SID's, but the SID's you are talking about (MachineSID) is the same in sysprep and NewSID (Machine SID)
