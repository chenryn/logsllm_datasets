BlueDriver, Carly for Toyota and FIXD, providing advanced
diagnostic and even remote-control functions. However, the
most popular apps (e.g. Torque Lite) are developed by third
parties for ELM327-based dongles, and thus they are compat-
ible with most of the dongles we purchased.
5.2 Experiment Setup
Our dynamic analysis is conducted on a 2015 Honda Civic
automobile in an empty parking lot to avoid unpredictable
accident. It has a standard OBD-II port locating under the
steering wheel, which allows us to plug in an OBD-II dongle
for testing. The dynamic analysis part of DONGLESCOPE is
implemented and deployed on a MacBook Pro laptop, with six
Intel Core i7-8850H CPUs (2.6 GHz) and 16 GB RAM, run-
ning 10.14.5 macOS Mojave. Our static companion app anal-
ysis ran on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04 equipped by
twelve Intel Core i7-8700 (3.2 GHz) CPUs and 32 GB RAM.
5.3 Vulnerability Analysis Results
After properly setting up our experiment environment, we ap-
plied DONGLESCOPE to the 77 OBD-II dongles as well as 21
companion mobile apps. Although previous security analysis
on OBD-II dongles has revealed insufﬁcient application-layer
authentication vulnerability and security holes in message
ﬁltering [3], our analysis is more comprehensive in that we
not only discover new vulnerabilities but also quantify them
among the dongles on the market. The complete assessment
results of all the dongles and companion apps are presented
in Table 3 and Table 4. In summary, we discover 5 types of
general vulnerabilities (with 4 being newly discovered) across
broadcast, connection and communication stages, and ﬁnd
that all the dongles are vulnerable to at least two of these vul-
nerabilities, which shows a widespread vulnerability exposure
in this new over-the-air vehicle attack surface today. In the
following, we present the detailed results based on each stage
of the analysis.
5.3.1 Connection Stage
V1. The majority (84.16%) of the dongles has nei-
ther connection-layer nor application-layer authentica-
tion. Our experiment results show that lack of authentication
at the connection stage widely exists among OBD-II dongles,
which can be further classiﬁed to the lack of authentication
at the connection layer and the application layer. The former
leads to arbitrary nearby connection since one can establish a
connection without providing any credentials. Based on the
established connection, the latter further enables any unautho-
rized users to communicate with the dongle, which essentially
allows unauthorized access to the CAN bus. In summary,
we ﬁnd that 84.16% of the dongles have neither connection-
layer or application-layer authentication, which provides an
attacker arbitrary access to the CAN bus once discovered by
the attacker in the broadcast stage.
V1.1. Nearly all (92.21%) dongles have no connection-
layer authentication by default. At the connection stage,
our tool reported that 71 (92.21%) dongles can be arbitrarily
connected by nearby devices while only 6 (7.79%) dongles
require authentication before connection, which implies weak
protections on the connection layer among these dongles.
With this vulnerability, an attacker can perform denial-of-
service attack by simply keeping connected with the target
dongle. We further discovered that there are two ways for
these 6 dongles to implement connection-layer authentication,
which is summarized in Table 5. As shown, OBDLink MX
adopts WPA2-PSK to authenticate their connection, which
requires users to enter a password. The entered credential
then generates a cryptographic key to establish a secure
communication channel to prevent eavesdropping attack. The
other way to implement authentication is through button.
Speciﬁcally, a user needs to press a physical button on the
dongle to let it enter a discoverable mode so that external
devices can scan and connect to it. This mode can last for
approximately a few minutes only and the time window
for connection is quite narrow. Among the 6 dongles, 5 of
them have applied this implementation. Interestingly, we also
discover one special case that the BlueDriver dongle will force
itself to sleep after 60 seconds if no connection is established,
which signiﬁcantly narrows the time window for attacks.
V1.2. Only 1 out of 77 dongles has application-layer au-
thentication by default. After connection is established,
DONGLESCOPE tried to directly inject CAN bus messages
to communicate with the dongle, and successfully queried
the VIN from 71 (92.21%) dongles, which indicates that they
have no application-layer authentication by default. We fur-
ther manually investigated the companion apps of the remain-
ing 6 dongles to understand the root cause of the injection
failure. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that only 1 dongle (namely Auto-
matic Pro) has implemented application-layer authentication.
The rest 5 dongles, including BlueDriver, HaulGauge, Innova,
DODYMPS, and OHP Forscan, also have no application-layer
authentication, since they are not ELM327-based and only
accept private manufacture-speciﬁc commands to perform ve-
hicle diagnosis. In this paper we call these commands private
commands, which can be found in the results of the predeﬁned
message generation from their companion apps. Interestingly,
we also discover that the developers of Automatic Pro have de-
ﬁned private commands to query VIN or read parameters from
the vehicle. The detailed content of these commands is pre-
sented in Table 6. Our results reveal that the private commands
are usually human-readable strings or numbers, as shown in
the last column of the table. These private commands are
then interpreted by the dongles into CAN bus messages and
relayed to the CAN bus. Note that these 5 dongles also lack
connection-layer authentication, and thus nearby attackers can
