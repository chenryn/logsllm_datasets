4Mechanical Turk is an online service that allows “requesters” to post
tasks which “workers” complete in exchange for money. Most of these
tasks are problems that are difﬁcult for computers to do accurately (e.g.,
transcribe recordings) or require human knowledge (e.g., review a product
or location).

of 0.05. In addition, we present p-values for all statistically
signiﬁcant tests (i.e., p < 0.05). A smaller p-value shows a
greater conﬁdence in the conclusion of a statistical test that
factor X has an impact on accuracy or speed. We found that
• Source, age, and gender have no signiﬁcant impact
on average accuracy rate across all of the schemes—
excluding the Asian characters. The age group 18–25
is signiﬁcantly faster than people in the 26–40 and
41–60 age groups. We also found participants from
Mechanical Turk are signiﬁcantly slower than Koreans
on hard questions.
• Language ability affects the performance of language-
based schemes (including Chinese characters, Japanese
characters, Korean characters, and English words), but
the inﬂuence is not always positive. In some cases, the
familiarity of a language can increase the accuracy or
decrease time while comparing representations which
utilize that particular language. However, for English
words, native speakers have lower recognition accuracy.
• In general, Base32, Random Art, T-Flag, and Flag
Extension provide fast and accurate comparisons of
both easy and hard questions.
In the remainder of this section, we show the result of each
factor or scheme in detail.
A. Impact of Source, Age, Gender
Source. On hard questions, participants from Mechanical
Turk were signiﬁcantly slower than participants from Korean
(on average 4.48 seconds per comparison versus 3.7 seconds
per comparison, p = 0.041). When we ignore the Asian
character schemes, there were no signiﬁcant differences for
accuracy or time on easy or hard items.
Age. On easy questions, age had no signiﬁcant impact on
the average time. On hard questions, the youngest age group
was faster than both 26 to 40 year olds (on average 3.93
seconds versus 4.47 seconds, p = 9.09 × 10
−3) and 41 to
60 year olds (on average 3.93 seconds versus 4.89 seconds,
p = 1.57× 10
−2). There were too few people (3) to make
meaningful conclusions about participants older than 60.
Gender.
There was no signiﬁcant difference between
males and females on easy or hard pairs with respect to
time or accuracy.

V. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we present the results of our study, analyze
the average accuracy rate and response time for both easy
and hard questions, and inspect
the impact of different
sources, age groups, gender, and hash comparison schemes.
The statistical test ANOVA along with post-hoc contrasts
were used to determine if group means were signiﬁcantly
different. All of our statistical tests use a signiﬁcance level
B. Impact of Language Ability
When selecting a hash comparison scheme, one would
like to know if the ability to recognize various Asian
characters will impact performance. To help answer this
question, we analyzed if Asian character recognition im-
pacted the accuracy and speed of hash comparison. Table III
summarizes the average accuracy and time for participants
with different
language abilities on the different Asian-
character-based schemes. To determine if knowledge of a
language provided better accuracy or speed, we compared
the performance of participants that spoke a language and
participants that did not speak the language.

Chinese. Knowledge of Chinese had no signiﬁcant impact
on speed. On easy pairs, Chinese speakers had similar
accuracy to non-Chinese speakers (both 97%). However,
Chinese speakers did have better accuracy on hard pairs.
On hard questions, Chinese speakers had an average accu-
racy of 76% compared to 53% for non-Chinese speakers
(p = 3.50× 10
−4).
Japanese.
Japanese speakers were signiﬁcantly faster on
hard items than non-Japanese speakers (4.18 seconds versus
5.62 seconds, p = 0.016), but had similar speeds on easy
items. Knowledge of Japanese had no statistically signiﬁcant
impact on accuracy. On easy questions, Japanese speakers
had an average accuracy of 99% (with a 95% conﬁdence
interval of ±19%) as opposed to 98% (±13%) for non-
Japanese speakers. On hard questions, Japanese speakers had
an average accuracy of 65% while non-Japanese speakers
had an average accuracy of 55%. Despite a 10% difference in
accuracy, the large variance in accuracy (±88% and ±94%
conﬁdence intervals) on hard pairs produces a p-value of
0.179 (not statistically signiﬁcant).
Korean.
Korean speakers were faster than non-Korean
speakers on both easy (3.72 seconds versus 4.72 seconds,
p = 0.018) and hard Korean items (3.90 seconds versus
5.05 seconds, p = 0.0136). On easy questions, the accuracy
was independent of knowledge of Korean. However, on hard

questions Korean speakers were signiﬁcantly more accurate
(84% versus 50%, p = 8.32× 10
English. We also analyzed if English only speakers (pos-
sibly native English speakers) had an advantage on English
words. Surprisingly, English only speakers were signiﬁcantly
less accurate on easy items than people who spoke Asian
languages (92% accuracy versus 96% accuracy, p = 0.018).
On hard questions, English only speakers’ accuracy was not
signiﬁcantly different than participants that knew at least
one Asian language (68% versus 60%, p = 0.19). Average
comparison time was not affected by knowing only English.

1) Further Analysis of Hard Question Pairs: Table IV
lists the accuracy of the individual hard pairs for the 4 differ-
ent language-based schemes (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
characters and English words). The third and fourth columns
indicate the accuracy of participants which recognize those
characters versus the accuracy of participants that do not
recognize those characters. For the English words, “speaker
accuracy” only includes participants that only speak English.
“Non-speaker accuracy” refers to participants that speak at
least one of the three Asian languages. The last column indi-
cates if speakers have a statistically signiﬁcant advantage (+)
or disadvantage (−) with respect to accuracy. (cid:6) indicates
that there is no signiﬁcant difference.
These results indicate that the ability to recognize a set
of characters provides an advantage during at least some
hard pairs (and no disadvantage). Questions that were most
difﬁcult for participants who could recognize the characters
are shown in Fig. 3,
including Question 1 of Chinese
characters, Question 2 of Japanese characters, Question 3
of Korean characters, and Question 5 of English words.
However, Question 1 of Chinese characters and Question 2
of Japanese characters were not the most difﬁcult questions
for participants who could not recognize the characters.
Such a difference may be attributed to stroke order: the
sequence of strokes in which a character is written. Every
Asian character has a particular stroke order. A participant
who has learned a set of Asian characters may compare
two characters by following the stroke orders (rather than
blindly trying to ﬁnd a difference in two images). Hence,
Asian language speakers have most difﬁculty comparing a
pair that differs at a late stroke order, e.g., Fig. 3(a)-3(c).
English only speakers’ advantage may have been the result
of which English the participants learned. English words
hard pair 4 was “jowly-begs-gaol” versus “ jowly-begs-
goal”. Those who learned the “Queen’s” English may know
that a “gaol” is a jail. However, few Americans may know
the word. As a result, those who learned American English
quickly notice the difference between “gaol” and “goal”.
C. Performance of Each Hash Comparison Scheme
Table V summarizes the performance of each scheme. The
ﬁrst column shows the average accuracy rate over all easy
pairs. The second column indicates the average accuracy
over all hard pairs. The third column shows the minimum
accuracy of a particular scheme among all hard pairs for
that scheme. The fourth and ﬁfth columns show the average
time a user needs to compare pairs.
Our analysis shows that at least 2 schemes signiﬁcantly
differ in both time and accuracy for both easy and hard
questions. We created partial order graphs to demonstrate
the order within the schemes from most to least accurate
and least time to most time (Fig. 4). In these graphs, an
edge from scheme A to scheme B means participants were
signiﬁcantly more accurate on scheme A than on scheme B
or required signiﬁcantly less time.
In addition, we compared all of the schemes with Asian-
language speakers removed from our sample because they
perform differently in the categories Chinese characters,
Japanese characters, and Korean characters based on our
previous analysis on language ability. Again, the differences
in accuracy and speed are statistically signiﬁcant for some
schemes. The partial order graphs for this set of data are
shown in Fig. 5.

D. Suggestion
Based on our results, we suggest that protocols which re-
quire users to perform a hash comparison should use Base32,
Random Art, T-Flag, or Flag Extension, because participants
perform well
in these schemes (for both baseline—easy
pairs—and worst case—hard pairs—scenarios), independent
of language ability. These suggested schemes allow faster
and more accurate comparison than the other schemes in-
dependent of participants’ ability to distinguish subtle color
differences (i.e., Flag) or to recognize different characters
(i.e., Chinese characters, Japanese characters, and Korean
characters).
VI. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss some topics related to hash
comparison schemes that were not yet addressed in the
paper: requirements, additional properties, and the limited
entropy of the hash comparison schemes. In addition to ac-
curacy and speed of comparison, hash comparison schemes
also have a number of different requirements and properties
that may impact what scheme works best for a given
application. Hash comparison schemes provide notably less
security than the underlying hash functions (20 to 30 bits of
entropy versus 128 or more bits). Protocol designers must
be aware of this limited entropy and design schemes that
prevent an attacker from brute forcing the hash comparison
scheme.
A. Additional Properties of the Hash Comparison Schemes
In this section, we discuss requirements and beneﬁts of
each hash comparison scheme.
Requirements.
Some of the schemes require the devices
to have certain properties to generate and display the hash
comparison. Random Art, Flag, T-Flag, and Flag Extension
require a color display. In addition, Random Art requires
a high resolution display. Random Art and Flag images
may appear different when printed on paper or displayed
on different screens with different contrast and brightness
settings. Without duplicate display settings, Random Art
and Flag that appear different may not represent different
data. The selection of 8 colorblind friendly colors for T-
Flag and Flag Extension ensures that differences in contrast
and brightness will not change the general colors one views.
Random Art images require signiﬁcant computation power
since each pixel is computed from a complex arithmetic
tree. On average, it takes about 8 seconds to generate a
180× 180 pixel Random Art image on a mobile device [2],
[7]. Devices that generate Chinese characters, Japanese
characters, and Korean characters, require codec support
to display corresponding character sets. Depending on the
intended application and platform, some of these require-
ments may rule out the use of certain hash comparison
schemes. For example, if the hash comparison scheme is
