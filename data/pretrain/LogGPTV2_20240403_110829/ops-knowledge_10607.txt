User: Switching to the ndb library on python GAE.
Can I use ndb with entities that were created previously using the low-level api? Or do I have to copy all the old entities and re-save them in order to use ndb?
Thanks!
Assistant: ndb is simply a wrapper API. The core datastore is based on protocol buffers, and doesn't care what you use to access it. In other words, yes AFAIK it should work just fine.
