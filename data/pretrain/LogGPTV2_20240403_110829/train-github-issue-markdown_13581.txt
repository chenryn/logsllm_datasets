  1. First bug found when displaying errors in collection. When numeration of ( **name** ) does not start from zero validation errors are displayed in bad collection memebers. For example:  
a) I add 3 new collection members  
b) I remove first member  
c) I submit a form (got validation errors)  
d) I add 1 new member  
e) I submit form again  
f) Validation errors are displayed in bad members, Last member does not have
validation errors. First elemet has errors no matter if it is valid or not.
  2. There is a bug in algorithm in documentation (http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html), when you remove some elements from the middle of collection, and then submit form, after page is reloaded you will get bad ( **name** ) numeration when add new tags i.e. input names will have same **name** value.
