### Issue 1: Validation Errors in Collection Members

**Description:**
A bug has been identified in the display of validation errors for collection members. When the numeration of collection items does not start from zero, validation errors are incorrectly displayed. This issue can be reproduced with the following steps:

1. Add three new collection members.
2. Remove the first member.
3. Submit the form (validation errors will appear).
4. Add one new member.
5. Submit the form again.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Validation errors are displayed for incorrect collection members.
- The last member does not show any validation errors, even if it is invalid.
- The first element always shows validation errors, regardless of its validity.

### Issue 2: Numeration in Collection Algorithm

**Description:**
There is a bug in the algorithm described in the Symfony documentation (http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html). When you remove elements from the middle of the collection and then submit the form, the page reloads with incorrect numeration for the remaining and newly added collection members. Specifically, input names will have duplicate values, leading to further issues.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Remove some elements from the middle of the collection.
2. Submit the form.
3. Observe the input names after the page reloads.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Input names should be unique and correctly numbered, even after removing and adding collection members.

**Actual Behavior:**
- Input names are not correctly numbered, resulting in duplicate values and potential form submission issues.

These issues need to be addressed to ensure that validation errors are correctly displayed and that the collection numeration remains consistent, even after modifying the collection.
