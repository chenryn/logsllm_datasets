User: In a multi-node Hadoop cluster, how to change the scheduling policy of YARN to improve job execution efficiency?
Assistant: In a multi-node Hadoop cluster, you can change the scheduling strategy of YARN in the following ways to improve job execution efficiency: 1. Modify the yarn-site.xml configuration file: you can change it by modifying the yarn-site.xml file The scheduling policy of YARN. The most important parameters are yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-vcores , yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores and yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.<queue-name>.maximum-allocation-vcores . These parameters can be used to control the amount of resources that can be used on each node and the amount of resources that can be allocated to each queue, thereby changing the scheduling strategy of YARN to achieve the purpose of improving job execution efficiency. 2. Use a higher-level scheduler: You can use a higher-level scheduler, such as Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler, to change the scheduling policy of YARN. These schedulers can dynamically allocate resources based on job priority, queue configuration, and other factors, thereby improving job execution efficiency. 3. Manage data locality: You can optimize YARN's scheduling strategy by managing data locality. Data locality refers to whether the data required for task execution is local. If the data is local, the task can be completed faster. Therefore, as much data locality as possible can be guaranteed by adjusting the number and location of data shards. In short, by modifying the YARN configuration file, using a high-level scheduler, and managing data locality, you can change the YARN scheduling strategy to improve job execution efficiency.
