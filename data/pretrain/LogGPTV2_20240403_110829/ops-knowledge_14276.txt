User: Please provide a solution that can effectively avoid SQL injection.
Assistant: Using parameterized query (Prepared statement) can effectively avoid SQL injection attacks. Parameterized query separates the SQL query statement from the parameter value to ensure that the parameter value will not be interpreted as code, avoiding the risk of SQL injection. In the specific implementation, you can use the PreparedStatement provided by the database, such as the following example: ``` PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"); statement.setString(1, username); statement .setString(2, password); ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(); ``` In this example, the username and password are passed as parameters to the PreparedStatement. By setting different parameter values, different query operations can be performed without worrying about SQL injection attacks and vulnerabilities.
