User: Explain what the OAuth 2.0 standard is and provide a practical application scenario.
Assistant: OAuth 2.0 is an open standard used to allow users to authorize third-party applications to access their protected resources, such as photos, contact lists, and other sensitive information, without sharing their credentials with the third-party application. OAuth 2.0 is based on an authorization flow in which a user authorizes a third-party application to access its resources. Processes are designed to be safe, simple and scalable. A practical use case might be for users to log in with their Google account to allow third-party applications to access their Google Drive files. A user taps the "Sign in with Google" button on a third-party application and authenticates through the OAuth 2.0 flow. The app then gained limited access to the user's Google Drive, allowing it to view and upload files without requiring the user to share the password or credentials of the Google account.
