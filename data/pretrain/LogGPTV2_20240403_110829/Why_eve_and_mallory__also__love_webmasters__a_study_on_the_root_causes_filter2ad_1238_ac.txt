### Correlation Analysis and Usability of X.509 Certificates

We conducted an analysis to identify interesting correlations between certificate error types and self-reported values. However, aside from the results previously described, we did not find any statistically significant correlations that would help predict the type of error based on specific characteristics. This highlights the importance of enhancing the usability of X.509 certificate configuration and deployment. Additionally, it underscores the need for more robust failsafe mechanisms and a general reduction in the burden on webmasters to ensure correct and secure X.509 certificate configurations.

### Webmaster Feedback on SSL Configuration

At the conclusion of our study, we solicited feedback from webmasters regarding the challenges they faced when setting up SSL for their websites and suggestions for improving the usability of X.509 certificate configuration. We present their concerns and suggestions in what we call the "Admins’ Wishlist."

#### 4.4 Admins’ Wishlist

We asked our participants to describe improvements they would like to see to make X.509 certificate configuration for HTTPS webservers easier and to identify what they believe is missing in the current system. In the following section, we analyze their statements and summarize the common themes. Out of the 755 responding administrators, 87 provided suggestions, with some offering multiple ideas. These suggestions can be categorized into six main groups:

1. **Lowering the Price:**
   - **Overview:** Thirteen participants expressed dissatisfaction with the current pricing of X.509 certificates that do not trigger browser warnings. They argued that the cost is disproportionately high for a task as simple as digitally signing a certificate.
   - **Suggestions:** Nine participants called for a Certificate Authority (CA) that issues free certificates accepted by popular browsers. Four participants specifically mentioned the high cost of wildcard certificates, suggesting that cheaper options are needed to reduce false positive warnings.

2. **Allowing CACert:**
   - **Overview:** Forty-five websites used X.509 certificates issued by CACert. Ten of these participants proposed adding the CACert root CA to all popular browsers as an alternative to commercial CAs.
   - **Motivation:** Twenty-eight administrators preferred CACert because they did not want to support commercial CAs and believed that basic encryption should be free. The remaining seventeen did not trust the centralized trust model of commercial CAs, citing breaches at DigiNotar and Comodo. They argued that CACert’s web of trust model provides better security.

3. **Better Support for Non-Validating Certificates:**
   - **Overview:** Fifteen participants were dissatisfied with being forced to use certificates from commercial CAs to avoid SSL warnings.
   - **Suggestions:** Seven participants suggested changes to the current trust model, including a trust-on-first-use model similar to Secure Shell (SSH) or the TACK trust model proposed by Moxie Marlinspike. Five participants wanted an easier way to use self-signed certificates, and four desired a simpler mechanism to validate certificate fingerprints.

4. **Better Tool Support:**
   - **Overview:** Six participants suggested improving the tools used to generate and configure X.509 certificates.
   - **Specific Issues:** They found the command-line interface of OpenSSL too complex and requested better documentation. They also criticized the configuration options of popular webservers, particularly the setup of virtual hosts, which they found error-prone.

5. **Auto-Update Reminder:**
   - **Overview:** Eight participants who used expired certificates were unaware of their expiration until contacted.
   - **Suggestion:** They proposed a service that sends automatic reminders about upcoming certificate expirations to prevent such issues.

### Discussion

Our study provides new insights and helps to better understand previous research in this field. While Akhawe and Felt [2] aimed for a 0% click-through rate for SSL warning messages, our study found that 330 out of 755 website administrators deliberately operated non-validating X.509 certificates and informed their users about the warning messages. In these cases, SSL warnings serve more as information dialogs, and users click through them as instructed by their administrators.

This finding explains the discrepancy in click-through rates reported by Akhawe et al. [2], where repeated clicks in Chrome are counted, while Firefox only counts the first visit. Our findings support the idea that Chrome's click-through rate is significantly influenced by re-visits to sites with non-validating certificates.

Many webmasters reported that their sites were either no longer in use or never intended for public access, highlighting the potential overreporting of handshake failures in studies using datasets from certificate crawlers.

### Limitations

1. **Population:**
   - We contacted webmasters from a random sample of 50,000 websites with non-validating X.509 certificates, without considering the popularity of the sites. Our results suggest that certificate warnings are more common on low-traffic sites, which are often considered unproblematic by webmasters.

2. **Self-Selection Bias:**
   - All participants were self-selected, potentially leading to a bias towards more active webmasters.

3. **Bounced Emails:**
   - Of the emails sent, 37,596 were bounced, indicating that many websites with non-validating certificates do not follow best practices for providing contact information.

4. **Underreporting:**
   - Some conclusions are drawn from free-text responses, leading to incomplete data. For example, not all participants reported whether their site was in use or who the SSL connection was intended for.

### Conclusions

This study is the first to engage with webmasters who operate non-validating X.509 certificates on their HTTPS-enabled websites to understand their motivations. Using a dataset of 4,487,463 certificates collected by Google's web crawler, we identified 610,966 non-validating certificates, selected a random sample of 50,000, and contacted their webmasters. Of the 8,549 successfully delivered emails, 755 webmasters responded.

Key findings include:
- 101 webmasters stated that their sites were not meant to be accessible.
- 330 webmasters deliberately used non-validating certificates, while 165 explained it as an accidental misconfiguration.
- 44 webmasters (25% of those who misconfigured) were confused about SSL configuration, reinforcing the need for better technical education and documentation.

Our findings align with previous studies, such as Akhawe et al. [2], and highlight the importance of understanding the behavior of both users and IT professionals in the context of SSL warnings and certificate management.
