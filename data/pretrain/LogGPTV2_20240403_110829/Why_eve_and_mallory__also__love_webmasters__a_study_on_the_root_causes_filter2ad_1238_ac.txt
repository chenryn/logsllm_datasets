We had been looking for interesting correlations between
certiﬁcate error types and certain self-reported values. How-
ever, except for the results described above, we did not ﬁnd
a statistically signiﬁcant correlation that would have helped
us predict what kind of error would occur because of which
characteristic. This underlines the importance of increasing
the usability of X.509 certiﬁcate conﬁguration and deploy-
ment in general, as well as building in more failsafe mecha-
nisms and generally taking the weight of correct and secure
X.509 certiﬁcate conﬁguration and deployment away from
webmasters.
At the end of the study, we asked the webmasters to de-
scribe problems they encountered with setting up SSL for
their website and suggestions they had to make X.509 cer-
tiﬁcate conﬁguration more usable. We present their concerns
and suggestions in what we call the Admins’ Wishlist.
4.4 Admins’ Wishlist
We asked our participants to describe improvements they
would like to add to make X.509 certiﬁcate conﬁguration for
HTTPS webservers easier and what they think is missing in
the current system. In the following section we analyze their
statements and describe what most participants ﬁnd lacking
in the current system. Of the 755 responding administrators,
87 oﬀered suggestions, some of them more than one. Their
suggestions can be categorized into six diﬀerent groups:
Lowering The Price: 13 of the participants mentioned
that the current price range for X.509 certiﬁcates that do not
throw warning messages in browsers is not adequate. They
ﬁnd that paying a high amount of money for such a low
cost task such as digitally signing an X.509 certiﬁcate is not
fair and they would like to see a change in the current pric-
ing policy of commercial Certiﬁcate Authorities. They criti-
cize that the current CA infrastructure “is a money printing
machine without providing strong security for both service
providers and their users” (W29). Nine of them asked for a
CA that issues free certiﬁcates that are accepted by popu-
lar browsers. Four participants complained that they have
to conﬁgure X.509 certiﬁcates for multiple subdomains and
that current wildcard certiﬁcates are too expensive. They
wished to get access to cheaper wildcard certiﬁcates to re-
duce the number of false positive warnings on their websites.
Allowing CACert: 45 websites operated an X.509 cer-
tiﬁcate issued by CACert7. 10 of these proposed to add the
CACert root CA to all popular browsers to provide an al-
ternative to the commercial CAs issuing trusted certiﬁcates.
The motivation to use a CACert certiﬁcate was two-minded:
28 of the administrators preferred CACert certiﬁcates since
they did not want to support the commercial CAs and are of
the opinion that basic encryption mechanisms as provided
by SSL should be accessible by everyone for free. The re-
maining (17) did not trust the centralized trust model of
commercial CAs after the breaches of DigiNotar and Com-
modo. They argued that the CACert’s web of trust model
provides more security and better protection against Certiﬁ-
cate Authority compromise attacks.
Better Support for Non-Validating Certiﬁcates: 15
participants complained that they were forced to use certiﬁ-
cates issued by commercial CAs to avoid SSL warning mes-
sages. They can be categorized into three diﬀerent groups:
7http://www.cacert.org
Seven participants would like to change the current trust
model. While two did not describe their idea of a diﬀerent
trust model, three would prefer a trust-on-ﬁrst-use-based
model such as known from the Secure Shell8 which would
allow them to use a certiﬁcate of their choice. Two other re-
sponders would prefer the TACK trust model proposed by
Moxie Marlinspike9 since they explicitly did not trust com-
mercial CAs. Five participants would like to have an easy
way to use self-signed certiﬁcates without giving concrete
ideas of how such a system could work and four participants
wanted to have an easier-to-use mechanism to validate cer-
tiﬁcate ﬁngerprints to be able to securely deploy self-signed
certiﬁcates for their users. Three participants were using
their own CA in an enterprise environment and criticized
the complicated workﬂow of adding their custom CAs to
their users’ browsers.
Better Tool Support: Six survey participants suggested
to improve the tool support to generate and conﬁgure X.509
certiﬁcates for webservers. They found the command line in-
terface for the OpenSSL tool10 too complicated and wished
for better documentation. The SSL conﬁguration options
of popular webservers were also criticized. Particularly the
conﬁguration of virtual hosts was described as very com-
plicated and error-prone and administrators generally re-
quested a more easy-to-use mechanism to conﬁgure X.509
certiﬁcates for multiple hostnames on a single IP address.
Auto-Update Reminder: Eight survey participants who
used an already expired certiﬁcate were not aware of that
fact before we contacted them. They criticized the fact that
they would not receive an automatic message when their cer-
tiﬁcate expired and would like to have a service that keeps
an eye on the expiration date of their certiﬁcate: “Ideally an
automatic message would be sent out to not miss the date to
re-new a server’s certiﬁcate” (W643).
5. DISCUSSION
Our study reveals new ﬁndings and helps to better under-
stand previous work in the ﬁeld. While Akhawe and Felt [2]
desire a 0% click-through rate for SSL warning messages,
in our study 330 of 755 website administrators stated that
they deliberately operate non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates
and that their users are informed of the warning message
beforehand.
In these cases, SSL warning messages are no
unexpected security warnings, but can be seen as informa-
tion dialogs that users expect and to which they react by
clicking through the warning because their administrator
told them to. Whenever websites with non-validating cer-
tiﬁcates are re-visited by users, and the users did not add
the non-validating certiﬁcate or the browser-untrusted CA
to their truststore, they will repeatedly click through the
warning. Since Google Chrome does not open the change
to its trust store in the warning menu, it is likely that users
will click-through a warning message on every visit. This
is one possible explanation for the huge diﬀerence in click-
through rates as reported by Akahwe et al.[2]: They count
every repeated click-through in Chrome, while they count
click-throughs in Firefox only at the ﬁrst visit to the respec-
tive website (which may or may not have occurred during
the period of their data collection). Thus, our ﬁndings sup-
8http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253
9http://tack.io/draft.html
10http://www.openssl.org/
511port the assumptions that Chrome’s click-through rate is
massively inﬂuenced by re-visits of websites that operate
non-validating certiﬁcates.
We found that many webmasters reported that their site
was either not in use any more, or that the SSL version of
the speciﬁc domain we encountered had never been meant
to be accessible for users at all and had respectively never
been hyperlinked anywhere on the Internet. This attests to
a very important ﬁnding: Studies using datasets of SSL cer-
tiﬁcates that were accumulated by certiﬁctae crawlers are
prone to massively overreport handshake failures and hence
SSL warning messages in browsers not only by assuming a
possibly not applicable set of trusted certiﬁcate issuers, but
also by including unused websites.
We gained valuable insights from the free texts the web-
masters wrote about problems with SSL and improvement
suggestions. Many of them wished for more simplicity: 165
had accidentally misconﬁgured SSL. Some wished for either
a simpler interface to set up a webserver, others wanted an
automatic renewal for expiring certiﬁcates.
330 webmasters had conﬁgured their webservers in a non-
validating way on purpose. 15 of them wished that there was
a broadly-accepted alternative to commercial CAs; in gen-
eral there were complaints about the pricing of CAs. This
is a very interesting ﬁnding: 20 of the 85 webmasters who
suggested improvements requested a free alternative to paid
CA certiﬁcates. Obviously these webmasters were not aware
of the fact that there are free alternatives11 that provide
free and trusted X.509 certiﬁcates, which demonstrates that
there is not only the need for a better technical education
but also for a broad and basic documentation, complete with
examples and links for webmasters, who understandably do
not call SSL their primary ﬁeld of expertise.
6. LIMITATIONS
Population: We contacted webmasters from a random
sample of 50,000 websites which operated non-validating
X.509 certiﬁcates without considering the popularity of the
given website. Our results imply that X.509 certiﬁcate warn-
ings occur more frequently on websites with low traﬃc which
is often regarded as unproblematic by their webmasters:
they claim that their users are aware of the presence of an
SSL warning message causative certiﬁcate.
Self-Selection Bias: All our participants were self-selected.
They chose to ﬁll out the survey, which could mean that
more active webmasters answered.
Bounced emails: We tried to reach webmasters either by
using the contact email address in the website’s X.509 certiﬁ-
cate or the PI:EMAIL email address. 37,596
of all emails we sent were bounced. Hence, the majority of
websites with non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates does neither
follow best practices and nor provide an easy-to-ﬁnd contact
email address. It might be possible that those webmasters
have diﬀerent reasons for using a non-validating X.509 cer-
tiﬁcate on their websites.
Underreporting: Some of our conclusions are drawn from
answers which were given as free text. Thus we do not have
data on all of our participants for several issues: Some did
not report on whether their website is in use/is meant to
be used at all, while others did. Not all of the users report
on who the SSL connection is intended for. Therefore it is
11e. g. www.startssl.com
possible that we underreport the websites which are out of
use, as well as the websites which exist for webmasters’ use
only.
7. CONCLUSIONS
We conducted the ﬁrst study with webmasters who oper-
ate non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates on their HTTPS-enabled
websites to understand their motives. Therefore, we used
the body of 4,487,463 certiﬁcates Google’s webcrawler had
collected over 12 months. We identiﬁed 610,966 non-validating
certiﬁcates, chose a random sample of 50,000 of these, es-
tablished if they were still operating and non-validating cer-
tiﬁcates, extracted email addresses for their webmasters and
emailed them. Of those emails, 8,549 were successfully deliv-
ered. Of these, 755 webmasters who operated websites with
non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates responded to our study.
101 said that their website was not meant to be accessi-
ble, and that actual users would not have encountered the
certiﬁcate as the webcrawler did. We found that of the
495 who reported on this issue, 330 said that their use of
a non-validating certiﬁcate was deliberate, while only 165
explained it with an accidental misconﬁguration. 44 of the
webmasters (25% of those who had accidentally misconﬁg-
ured their webserver) stated that they were confused about
SSL conﬁguration in general, strengthening the assumption
already made by Fahl et al[4] that, while warning messages
and user behavior are an important ﬁeld of study, studies
with IT professionals in general and webmasters and devel-
opers in particular are an important and often neglected
issue. We conﬁrm ﬁndings from Akahwe et al., who state
that Google Chrome users tend to click through warning
messages more easily: This goes well with our ﬁnding that
many webmasters use non-validating certiﬁcates on purpose
and inform their users about it. Clicking through these
warnings will add the certiﬁcate to Firefox, while Google
Chrome will show a new warning on each revisit.
