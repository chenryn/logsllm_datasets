Question: The security team of XYZ Corporation is reviewing their current password policies after a series of attempted cyber attacks. They learned that adversaries could exploit weak password policies to perform dictionary and brute-force attacks. To enhance their security posture, the team is considering the implementation of new mitigation strategies. Which combination of strategies would most effectively reduce the risk of adversaries successfully discovering and exploiting their password policy?
"A": "Implementing account lockout policies and ensuring registration of only valid password filters in the domain controller's system registry.",
"B": "Decreasing the minimum password length requirement to reduce the complexity of user passwords, making them less prone to being cracked.",
"C": "Disabling the command shell utilities that adversaries could use to discover password policies, such as 'net accounts' on Windows.",
"D": "Educating users to avoid using complex passwords so that they do not write them down, reducing the chance of physical compromise."
Answer: A
