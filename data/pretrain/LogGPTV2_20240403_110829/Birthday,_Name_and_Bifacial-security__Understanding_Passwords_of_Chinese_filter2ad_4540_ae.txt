[30] noted that user-IDs and emails have a great impact
on password security. For instance, 53% of Dodonew
passwords can be guessed by using user-IDs within an
average of 706 guesses. This motivates us to investigate
to what extent the Pinyin names and Chinese-style dates
impact the security of Chinese passwords.
In 2018,
AlSabah et al. [2] studied 79,760 passwords leaked from
the Qatar National Bank, customers of which are mainly
Middle Easterners. They observed that over 30% of
passwords contain names, over 5% use a 2-digit birth
year, and 4% include their own phone number in whole
as part of their password.
2.2 Password security
is password
A crucial password research subject
strength.
Instead of using brute-force attacks, earlier
works (e.g., [32, 43]) use a combination of ad hoc
dictionaries and mangling rules, in order to model the
common password generation practice and see whether
user passwords can be successfully rebuilt in a period of
time. This technique has given rise to automated tools
like John the Ripper (JTR), hashcat and L0phtCrack.
Borrowing the idea of Shannon entropy, the NIST-
800-63-2 guide [10] attempts to use the concept of pass-
word entropy for estimating the strength of password
creation policy underlying a password system. Password

entropy is calculated mainly according to the length
of passwords and augmented with a bonus for special
checks. Florencio and Herley [19], and Egelman et al.
[17] improved this approach by adding the size of the al-
phabet into the calculation and called the resulting value
log2((al pha.size)pass.len) the bit length of a password.
However, previous ad hoc metrics (e.g., password
entropy and bit length) have recently been shown far
from accurate by Weir et al. [57]. They suggested that
the approach based on simulating password cracking
sessions is more promising. They also developed a novel
method that ﬁrst automatically derives word-mangling
rules from password datasets by using PCFG, and then
instantiates the derived grammars by using string seg-
ments from external input dictionaries to generate guess-
es in decreasing probability order [58]. This PCFG-
based cracking approach is able to crack 28% to 129%
more passwords than JTR when allowed the same guess
number. It is considered as a leading password cracking
technique and used in a number of recent works [36,56].
Differing from the PCFG-based approach, Narayanan
and Shmatikov [40] introduced the Markov-Chain theo-
ry for assigning probabilities to letter segments, which
substantially reduces the password search space. This
approach was tested in an experiment against 142 re-
al user passwords and could break 68% of them.
In
2014, by utilizing various normalization and smoothing
techniques from the natural language processing domain,
Ma et al. [36] systematically evaluated the Markov-based
model. They found it performs signiﬁcantly better than
the PCFG-based model at large guesses (e.g., 230) in
some cases when parameterized appropriately.
In this
work, we perform extensive experiments by using both
models to evaluate the strength of Chinese passwords.
When these password models are coupled with tools
(e.g., AUTOFORGE [63]) that can automatically forge
valid online login requests from the client side, server-
side mechanisms like rate-limiting (see Sec. 5.2.2 of
[25]) and password leakage detection [31] become nec-
essary. However, in reality, few sites have implemented
proper countermeasures to thwart online guessing. A-
