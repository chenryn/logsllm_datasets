### BLIND XSS: An Overview and Practical Guide

#### Introduction
Hi, I'm Adam Baldwin. Not the actor, but the Chief Security Officer at &yet and the Security Lead for ^Lift Security. You can find me on Twitter at @adam_baldwin and @liftsecurity.

#### What is Blind XSS?
Blind XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of XSS attack where the attacker has no direct feedback or visibility into whether the payload has been executed. This makes it a unique challenge compared to other types of XSS attacks, such as:

- **Reï¬‚ected XSS**: The payload is reflected off the web server and executed in the user's browser.
- **Persistent (Stored) XSS**: The payload is stored on the server and served to users when they visit the affected page.
- **DOM-based XSS**: The payload is executed in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) without being sent to the server.

**Blind XSS Characteristics:**
- **No Immediate Feedback**: Unlike Blind SQL Injection, where you get immediate feedback, Blind XSS does not provide any direct indication of success.
- **Uncertainty**: You have no idea where your payload will end up or if it will even execute.
- **Strategic Planning**: You must carefully plan what you want to accomplish and be prepared to listen for signs of success.

#### Steps to a Successful Blind XSS Exploit
1. **Carefully Choose the Right Payload**: Select a payload that fits the specific situation and context.
2. **Get Lucky**: Sometimes, success in Blind XSS requires a bit of luck.

#### Payload Management
- **Payload Variety**: There are many payloads for different situations, but using all of them would be overkill.
- **Planning Your Payload**: Consider how the application will use your data. Common targets include:
  - Log viewers
  - Exception handlers
  - Customer service apps (chats, tickets, forums, etc.)
  - Moderated content

#### Tools and Resources
- **xss.io**: A tool that can help manage and deploy Blind XSS payloads.
  - **Character Space**: Sometimes you need all the character space you can get. xss.io uses custom referrer-based redirects instead of short URLs.
  - **Exploit Creator**: Provides snippets for common tasks, allowing you to quickly create and reference dynamic payloads.
  - **Dead Drop Blind XSS API and Manager**: A demo of how xss.io can be used to manage and deploy payloads.

#### Additional Resources
- **CSRF.IO**: Another useful tool for security testing, though unrelated to Blind XSS.
