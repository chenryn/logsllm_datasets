BLIND XSS IS:
IT’S A DIFFERENT 
CHALLENGE.
IT’S NOT LIKE BLIND SQLI 
WHERE YOU GET 
IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA 
WHERE YOUR PAYLOAD’S 
GOING TO END UP.
YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW 
WHETHER YOUR PAYLOAD 
WILL EXECUTE (OR WHEN!)
YOU MUST THINK AHEAD 
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT 
TO ACCOMPLISH.
... AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
LISTENING.

PLAN YOUR PAYLOAD.
HOW WILL THE APP USE 
YOUR DATA?

• anything moderated
NICE TARGETS:
BLIND XSS MANAGEMENT
XSS.IO CAN HELP!
SIZE MATTERS... RIGHT?
• Sometimes you need all the 
character space you can get.
• No short-url GUID
• xss.io uses custom referrer-
based redirects instead 
EXPLOIT CREATOR
• Snippets for common tasks
• Quickly create and reference 
dynamic payloads
