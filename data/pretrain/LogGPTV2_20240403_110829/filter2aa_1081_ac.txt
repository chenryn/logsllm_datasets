Within different flash chips, data can be present at any given point in time and can be recovered by physically examining the flash memory itself (10). This fact is extremely helpful for forensic investigators searching for fragments of evidence. Since forensics and data sanitization (anti-forensics) are closely related, this article provides valuable background information on the possibility of recovering data from solid-state drives (SSDs) and individual flash memory chips.

A 2012 paper by Yuri Gubanov and Oleg Afonin, titled "Why SSD Drives Destroy Court Evidence, and What Can Be Done About It," addresses early concerns about the impact of SSDs on the digital forensics process. The central theme of the paper is the contamination or self-corrosion of evidence by the SSD controller. Unlike traditional hard drives, several factors influence the likelihood of data recovery from SSDs. The presence and support of the TRIM command, along with drive usage and operating system configuration, often significantly impact forensic efforts. The paper also discusses the impact of full-disk encryption on data recoverability. Interestingly, a fully encrypted SSD is more likely to have recoverable data than a non-encrypted one, provided the investigator has access to the decryption key or password. This is because SSD controllers cannot optimize data, and TRIM is typically non-functional on a fully encrypted disk.

In 2013, Gabriele Bonetti, Marco Viglione, Alessandro Frossi, Federico Maggi, Stefano Zanero, and Politecnico di Milano published "A Comprehensive Black-Box Methodology for Testing the Forensic Characteristics of Solid-State Drives." This paper builds on previous work, recognizing the practicality and potential value of performing preliminary forensic investigation techniques through the SSD's controller (black-box analysis) rather than the more complex and failure-prone approach of bypassing the flash translation layer and accessing the flash memory chips directly (white-box analysis). Using similar methodologies as Bell, the researchers sometimes failed to replicate previous results, even with identical drives, controllers, and firmware. Based on an analysis of three popular SSD models and the presence of TRIM, garbage collection, wear leveling, and compression, they sought to establish a framework for gauging the likelihood of successful file recovery on a given SSD. The test SSDs were ranked from "Complete Wiping" (no data can be recovered) to "Platter Disk Equivalent" (SSD behavior matches that of a traditional hard drive). This research supports many of the conclusions first seen in earlier papers and provides a framework to communicate the results.

Solid-state drive technology is still in its infancy, and much more research, development, and understanding are needed. As with any new equipment, inherent changes must be evaluated in light of existing technologies and processes. SSDs differ significantly from magnetic storage media, using different algorithms for storing data, containing surplus memory capacity for replacing failed memory blocks, and managing deletion operations, which can only be performed on an entire block at a time. Consequently, this revolutionary change in storage architecture demands a corresponding revolution in the computer forensics field. Understanding current research will help direct the scope of testing, explore and address issues, and guide the focus of this study to modify and improve existing forensic techniques to manage this new technology.

### Challenges

This research will focus on and attempt to reconcile several challenges faced by forensic investigators when working with SSDs. One area of particular concern is the autonomy of SSDs and their potential to modify or delete evidence without external input. Wear leveling and garbage collection algorithms may result in data being moved between or removed from physical flash memory locations. Since these operations are managed by the onboard SSD controller, deletions may occur independently of commands issued by the host device controller or operating system, regardless of whether a write blocker is in place (Bell, 10-11). It is possible that modification could occur while the device is powered on but disconnected from any computer or data connection. This research will investigate the autonomy of SSDs upon the deletion of a file and attempt to isolate garbage collection operations to determine which events are more likely to trigger evidence loss.

The management of writes and rewrites within an SSD presents a new challenge for forensic investigators. The physical requirement that flash cells be completely erased before being rewritten is a significant change from the operation of magnetic hard drives, where data could be rewritten without preparation or erasure. Since refreshing a flash cell is time-intensive, it is generally best performed when the drive is idle. SSD performance depends heavily on a pool of available, pre-refreshed flash ready for use (Leventhal, 27). Because these drives are marketed as performance-boosting devices, manufacturers are under constant pressure to increase drive speed. Current forensic work relies on recovering data artifacts produced during the magnetic recording process, which is not designed with SSD architecture in mind. Existing forensic practices must be adapted to yield results with this new technology.

SSDs also present a marked increase in the number of variables that must be considered during an investigation. With traditional hardware, the data recovery process is mainly dependent on the operating system and file system of the evidence drive. For example, evidence from a Windows machine using a magnetic hard drive can be captured and processed using similar procedures in nearly all investigations, regardless of the drive's form factor, storage capacity, or manufacturer. However, SSDs can behave differently depending on the operating system in use (King, S114). Individual drive properties are significantly influenced by the firmware of the onboard SSD controller. Different manufacturers produce drives with different controllers or firmware versions, and competing models of SSDs contain varying amounts of spare flash memory capacity. Each of these differences poses a variable and potential challenge to forensic investigators. Although it will be impossible to test every possible combination, this research will attempt to demystify some of these variables to provide insight for future work and investigations.

### Overview of Storage Architecture

SSDs and magnetic hard drives are fundamentally different hardware. Both storage platforms utilize different material properties to store data on their respective physical media. Due to these distinct differences, magnetic hard drives and SSDs cannot be considered the same type of hardware, even though both accomplish the same goal.

Both drives share a common property: they are designed to be presented as storage to an operating system. Although SSDs represent a newer, updated storage technology, they are intended to serve as drop-in replacements for traditional hard drives. Generally, the operating system should not require any special modifications or drivers to utilize either form of storage. Drives are ultimately designed to abstract the physical medium of data storage from the user. However, from an information forensics perspective, understanding the operations behind this layer of abstraction is critically important. While both the operating system and the user may be unaware of the distinction between different types of drives, a forensic investigator must be acutely aware of the unique characteristics of each type of storage device they must interrogate for evidence.

#### Magnetic Hard Drives

The operation and behavior of traditional hard drives are well understood and documented. The form and function of these drives have remained largely unchanged over the past 15 to 20 years. Although drive capacities have increased exponentially, the process by which data is stored, encoded, and accessed remains essentially the same. Because of this, forensic investigators are familiar with handling these types of drives.

Inside a hard drive, circular metal discs called platters are coated with a magnetic recording layer. Platters are typically made from aluminum, although glass and ceramic substrates have also been used. Platters have a fixed capacity, and drives may use multiple stacked platters to increase overall capacity. When the drive is in operation, these platters spin rapidly at a constant speed governed by a precise motor. Data is recorded in a series of circular tracks, written and accessed using a recording head. This component is physically analogous to the needle on a phonograph but does not operate in a purely sequential manner. Additionally, hard drive tracks consist of concentric circles, as opposed to a spiral groove.

The drive electronics are responsible for moving the head to (seeking) the proper position to align the drive heads over the track containing the data to be written or read. The data itself is stored in sectors, which represent the smallest quantity of storage usable at a time. Generally, drives use a sector size of 512 bytes, although larger capacity drives are moving to larger sector sizes in response to ever-increasing platter densities. The actual data is read and recorded using a magnetic coil. The drive electronics can discern minute differences in the magnetic field of the drive platters and decode this into a binary representation of the encoded and stored data.

To accurately read and store data, a great deal of precision between all these mechanical and physical components is required. Normal drive operation can be negatively impacted by shock, vibration, or dust coming into contact with the head or platters. Any disassembly of a hard drive places the stored data at extreme risk for corruption due to the tight mechanical tolerances required. Generally, any work involving the platters themselves must be done in a clean-room environment by an engineer familiar with the dangers and processes involved. Depending on the condition of a drive, it is possible to rebuild a damaged or non-functional drive to recover critical data. This is an inherently perilous and expensive process, employed only when the value of the data exceeds the costs and risks associated with such data recovery methods.

#### Solid State Drives

SSDs are designed to serve as drop-in replacements for traditional hard drives. Although the physical storage media and operation of the device are completely different compared to a magnetic hard drive, the drive electronics are designed to abstract these properties from the operating system and user as much as possible. From a consumer and end-user perspective, this is a major benefit, as these drives will work with existing operating systems and hardware without additional inconvenience or effort. However, since these drives are fundamentally different technologies, techniques for obtaining and managing evidence acquisition from these drives may need to change.

Evaluating SSDs is a challenging proposition: although the basic data storage properties are constant across product lines, there is a significant degree of variance between the drives themselves. Individual drive components, including the type of flash memory, the controller, the firmware, and the compression and data management algorithms, can differ greatly between individual drive models and even more substantially between manufacturers.

#### Flash Memory

Flash memory is the physical storage medium in an SSD. The structure and physical properties of flash memory cells are responsible for many of the operating characteristics of SSDs. In many respects, significant engineering accommodations are required for raw flash memory to come together as a single storage device.

Different types of flash memory cells are available: Single-Level Cell (SLC) and Multi-Level Cell (MLC). SLC flash memory cells store one bit, represented in binary as either a one or a zero. MLC flash memory, on the other hand, offers the ability to store two bits in a single cell. This is accomplished by using multiple levels of charge to simulate the binary values of 00, 01, 10, and 11. Different voltage levels correspond to different values. Due to the minute differences between the electrical characteristics of these binary values, MLC flash is significantly more sensitive (and potentially less reliable) than SLC flash.

At the physical layer, flash memory is divided into pages. Pages are the smallest addressable unit within a flash memory cell. Pages cannot be overwritten because erasing pages could potentially modify adjacent cells within a block. This is a physical limitation of the storage medium itself. Therefore, only entire blocks are erased at a time.

A completely overwritten flash cell is represented in binary as being filled entirely with 1s. To store data, these 1s are overwritten with 0s. However, once a 1 is changed to a 0, it cannot be changed back without completely erasing the block (resetting it back to 1s) and starting over from scratch. At present, this is an absolute requirement, as the process of erasing a block requires significant quantities of both electrical current and time.

When data is deleted on an SSD, the blocks containing the data are marked as invalid. However, since they still contain data, they cannot be immediately reused without first being erased to a clean state and returned to the pool of free blocks. These operating procedures ensure that there is some period of delay from the time data is deleted at the operating system level to when it is actually deleted from the flash memory itself.

Flash memory cells also have a finite usable amount of write cycles. It is not uncommon for individual blocks to fail with age as they are used. Due to the nature of computer I/O operations, certain files are more frequently modified than others, resulting in uneven utilization patterns. Some blocks are frequently rewritten, while others (such as the locations of core operating system files) sit relatively idle.
