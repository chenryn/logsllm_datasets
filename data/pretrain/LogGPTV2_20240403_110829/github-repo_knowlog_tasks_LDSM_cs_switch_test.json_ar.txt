The limit may be reached during normal operation if a PITR discovers a large number of dynamic hosts in the EID-prefix ranges enabled for dynamic learning. If the dynamic local database size limit is reached new hosts will not be discovered. It is worth noting that it is normal for the local database to have a limit for dynamic entries for example to set an upper limit on the amount of memory required. To diagnose this issue it may be helpful to inspect the local database using show ip[v6] lisp [eid-table ] database. The entries can also be cleared with clear lisp[eid-table ] dynamic-eid. If this is a warning for approaching the limit this syslog message can be turned off by removing the warning-threshold  configuration statement from the database-mapping limit dynamic configuration."
