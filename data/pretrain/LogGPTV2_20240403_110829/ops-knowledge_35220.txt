Question: "A software development team is transitioning to DevSecOps practices to enhance their project's security posture. As part of this transition, they are considering automation strategies for infrastructure, deployment, and security activities. Which of the following statements is a valid reason for implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) as part of their DevSecOps practices?"
 "A": "IaC allows the manual provisioning of computing resources, which increases the reliability and repeatability of the deployment process."
 "B": "IaC is based on using tools and automation to speed up the provisioning process, making it more reliable and repeatable."
 "C": "IaC benefits include reduced collaboration between development and operations teams due to the increased complexity of the environment."
 "D": "IaC commonly involves the use of GUI-based tools instead of APIs, as it is more suitable for projects without Cloud-based resources."
