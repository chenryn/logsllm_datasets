This section is acceptable, but it replicates functionality already provided by the template package. A more efficient approach would be to create a single template and load both `.html` files using a single call to `ParseFiles`. Then, use `ExecuteTemplate` instead of managing a custom map. It would also be beneficial to inform users that caching is handled automatically when they use these methods.
