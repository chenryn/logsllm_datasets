    This section is fine and can stay, but it duplicates existing functionality of the
    template package. Instead, the program could create a single template, load both the
    .html files in one call to ParseFiles, and use ExecuteTemplate instead of its own map.
    Would be nice to show users that the caching stuff is done for them if you ask politely.
