My app use an exception reporting framework that depends on the fact that all
exceptions should be serializable. When
org.springframework.web.client.HttpStatusCodeException is thrown in a
RestTemplate method, the exception reporting framework complains that a
Charset object in the HttpStatusCodeException is not serializable.

**Affects:** 3.1.1
