Adversaries may exploit resource-intensive features of applications to initiate a denial of service (DoS) attack, thereby disrupting the availability of those applications. For instance, certain functionalities in web applications can be particularly resource-heavy. By repeatedly invoking these features, attackers can deplete system resources, leading to the unavailability of the application or even the server itself.
