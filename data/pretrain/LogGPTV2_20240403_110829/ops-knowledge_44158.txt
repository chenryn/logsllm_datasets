User: Please introduce the core components of the Kubernetes cluster and their functions
Assistant: The core components of the Kubernetes cluster include the following: 1. Kubernetes API Server: It is the control center of the Kubernetes cluster. All operations and management are realized through the API Server, which assumes the core role of the Kubernetes cluster. 2. etcd: It is a distributed key-value storage of Kubernetes, which is used to store cluster status, configuration information, and service discovery. 3. Kubernetes Controller Manager: As the core controller in the Kubernetes cluster, it is responsible for monitoring cluster resource changes, performing scheduling and copy control operations. 4. Kubernetes Scheduler: Responsible for allocating container applications to appropriate working nodes, and considering factors such as resource constraints to achieve optimal container deployment and operation. 5. Kubernetes Kubelet: It is an agent on each working node. It communicates with the API Server to manage the container life cycle and report the status of the node. 6. Kubernetes Container Runtime: It is the core component for running containers in a Kubernetes cluster, and supports multiple container runtimes such as Docker, CRI-O, and Containerd. 7. Kubernetes Dashboard: Provides a visual management control panel for users to visually view and manage Kubernetes clusters. These core components work together to form the core architecture of the Kubernetes cluster, realizing functions such as high availability, dynamic scheduling, and management of container applications.
