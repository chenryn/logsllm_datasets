User: How to monitor the network traffic of the system and make real-time statistics?
Assistant: 1. Use network monitoring tools: You can use network monitoring tools such as Wireshark, tcpdump, etc. to capture, analyze and capture network traffic, and then perform real-time statistics and monitor system network traffic. 2. Use traffic analysis tools: You can use network traffic analysis tools such as NTOP, snort, iftop, etc. to monitor network traffic in real time, to conduct real-time statistics and monitoring of network traffic, and to identify, classify and filter bad network traffic in real time to protect the network Safety. 3. Use system built-in tools: You can use system built-in tools such as Netstat, Iperf, nmap, etc. to conduct real-time statistics and monitoring of network traffic by analyzing, monitoring, and testing network bandwidth and connection speed, so as to effectively detect and solve network failures . 4. Use third-party monitoring software: You can also use network traffic monitoring software such as PRTG Bandwidth Monitor and SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor to monitor, analyze and report real-time network traffic in order to better understand the system network traffic and provide help for optimization A function of network traffic.
