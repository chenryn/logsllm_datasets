User: For the last several weeks, I have been making a parental controls program (just for my friend and myself), in Python (it's what I know). I used CX_Freeze to get the .exe, and it works wonderfully. Everything is great... But I need a way to make the process unkillable to standard users. (just standard users. I want admins to be able to kill this easily if need be.)
I was pursuing a method in which my .exe was turned into a windows service, thereby making it "SYSTEM" and unkillable to standard users. So far, the service cannot kill a process by using taskkill /im, and cannot create required setup .txt files.
Since that method appears to be failing, I thought I would ask if anyone knows of a way to make a process untouchable to standard users? I'm not entirely sure what professional parental controls/keyloggers/virus protection software uses to keep the user from killing the process, but perhaps something like that?
Assistant: So, I know this question is like 5 years old, but you can make it actually kinda unkillable to even the admin. Make the program run as admin, so only admins can kill it. Then, make a loop that kills consent.exe constantly (consent.exe is the UAC pop-up). To kill the process, you need to be an admin, but you can't be an admin, because you can't accept the UAC prompt. But there is a catch. If you disable UAC via UAC settings, you can become an admin and kill the process. This can be used as a kind of failsafe.
