Heyho,
I just want to leave a comment: I installed the lastest alpha from npm, and
get an error with webpack:
`ERROR in ./~/angular2/src/facade/async.js Module not found: Error: Cannot
resolve module 'rxjs/operators/toPromise' in
...\angular2-test\node_modules\angular2\src\facade @
./~/angular2/src/facade/async.js 13:0-35`
So the problem is here: The `import 'rxjs/operators/toPromise';` is wrong, the
correct import would be `import 'rxjs/operator/toPromise';`.
With this change I can use the angular sources again.
