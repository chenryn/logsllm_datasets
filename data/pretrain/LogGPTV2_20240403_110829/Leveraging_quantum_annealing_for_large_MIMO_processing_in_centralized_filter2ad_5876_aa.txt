## Abstract
The demand for wireless capacity continues to outpace supply, driving significant advancements in MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) physical layer techniques. However, high-performance MIMO systems remain impractical due to their computationally intensive algorithms. The computational requirements grow exponentially with the number of users and data rates, making the base station's computational capacity a key limiting factor. QuAMax is the first large MIMO centralized radio access network design that addresses this issue by leveraging quantum annealing. We implemented QuAMax on the 2,031 qubit D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, the state-of-the-art in the field. Our experimental results show that 10 µs of compute time on the 2000Q can enable 48-user, 48-AP antenna BPSK communication at 20 dB SNR with a bit error rate of \(10^{-6}\) and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of \(10^{-4}\).

## 1 Introduction
A central challenge for future wireless networks is to meet the ever-increasing demand for capacity and throughput. Recent advances, including 5G efforts, call for the use of large and massive MIMO antenna arrays to support multiple users near a wireless access point (AP) or base station. These techniques, such as multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), are being implemented in LTE cellular and 802.11ac local-area networks, where up to eight antennas are supported at the AP.

From a design standpoint, the centralized radio access network (C-RAN) architecture is one of the most promising and cost-effective ways to implement 5G technologies. C-RAN centralizes physical-layer processing from multiple APs to a centralized data center, supporting hundreds or thousands of APs. To fully realize the potential throughput gains of massive MIMO, the system must efficiently demultiplex mutually interfering information streams. Current large MIMO designs, such as Argos, BigStation, and SAM, use linear processing methods like zero-forcing and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) filters, which have low computational complexity but suffer when the MIMO channel is poorly conditioned. Sphere Decoder-based maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO decoders can improve throughput but have prohibitive computational requirements.

The problem of limited computational capacity arises because the receiver's physical layer must decode a frame before the sender requires feedback. For Wi-Fi, this is tens of microseconds, and for 4G LTE, it is 3 ms. As a result, most current systems adopt linear filters, accepting a performance drop.

**New Approach: Quantum Computation in the Data Center.** This paper explores the use of quantum computation (QC) to speed up the ML MIMO decoder. We place our ideas in the context of QC realized in experimental hardware and the C-RAN architecture. We envision a future quantum computer co-located with C-RAN resources in a data center, connected to APs via high-speed, low-latency fiber or millimeter-wave links.

Optimization is a key application of quantum computing, and it is believed that Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices may achieve polynomial or exponential speedups over classical algorithms. This paper presents QuAMax, the first system to apply quantum annealing (QA) to the ML MIMO decoding problem in a centralized RAN architecture. Our contributions include:
1. The first reduction of the ML MIMO decoding problem to a form that a QA solver can process.
2. A new, communications-specific evaluation metric, Time-to-BER (TTB), which evaluates QA performance in achieving a target bit error rate (BER).
3. Evaluation of QuAMax under various scenarios and parameter settings, showing that 10–20 µs of computation time on the D-Wave 2000Q can achieve a BER of \(10^{-6}\) and a frame error rate of \(10^{-4}\) for 48-user, 48-AP antenna binary modulation.

## 2 Background
### 2.1 Primer: Maximum Likelihood Detection
Consider \(N_t\) mobile users, each with one antenna, sending data bits to a multi-antenna (Nr ≥ Nt) MIMO AP using OFDM. The users map their data bits into a complex-valued symbol vector \(\bar{v} = [\bar{v}_1, \bar{v}_2, \ldots, \bar{v}_{N_t}]^{\top} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_t}\). Each user sends from a constellation O of size \(|O| = 2^Q\) (Q bits per symbol). The MIMO decoding problem seeks the set of transmitted symbols that minimizes the error with respect to the received symbols:

\[
\hat{v} = \arg \min_{v \in O^{N_t}} \| y - H v \|^2
\]

where \(H \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r \times N_t} = H_I + j H_Q\) is the wireless channel, and \(y \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r} = H \bar{v} + n\) is the received set of symbols, perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) \(n \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r}\). The Sphere Decoder reduces the search space by constraining it to a hypersphere of radius \(\sqrt{C}\) centered around \(y\). This transforms the problem into a tree search, with a height of \(N_t\) and a branching factor of \(|O|\).

Table 1 shows the average number of tree nodes visited for ML Sphere decoding, highlighting the exponential increase in computation. For example, for 8 clients with 16-QAM symbols, 15 clients with QPSK symbols, or 30 clients sending BPSK symbols, the Sphere Decoder visits close to 2,000 tree nodes, saturating Intel’s Skylake core i7 architecture.

### 2.2 Primer: Quantum Annealing
Quantum Annealers are specialized, analog computers that solve NP-complete and NP-hard optimization problems, with potential for substantial speedups over conventional computing. Many NP-hard problems can be formulated in the Ising model, which many QA machines use as input. Applications in networking that could benefit from QA include MIMO downlink precoding, channel coding, network routing, security, and scheduling.

**Quantum Annealing Hardware.** Compared to simulated annealing, QA exploits quantum effects such as tunneling and relaxation to circumvent computational bottlenecks. With the D-Wave quantum annealer, the research community can now run experiments and study the conditions under which QA provides an advantage.
