ABSTRACT
User demand for increasing amounts of wireless capacity continues
to outpace supply, and so to meet this demand, significant progress
has been made in new MIMO wireless physical layer techniques.
Higher-performance systems now remain impractical largely only
because their algorithms are extremely computationally demanding.
For optimal performance, an amount of computation that increases
at an exponential rate both with the number of users and with the
data rate of each user is often required. The base station’s computa-
tional capacity is thus becoming one of the key limiting factors on
wireless capacity. QuAMax is the first large MIMO centralized radio
access network design to address this issue by leveraging quantum
annealing on the problem. We have implemented QuAMax on the
2,031 qubit D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, the state-of-the-art
in the field. Our experimental results evaluate that implementation
on real and synthetic MIMO channel traces, showing that 10 µs
of compute time on the 2000Q can enable 48 user, 48 AP antenna
BPSK communication at 20 dB SNR with a bit error rate of 10−6
and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of 10−4.

to this end, including the 5G efforts underway in industry and
academia, call in particular for the use of Large and Massive multi-
ple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna arrays to support many
users near a wireless access point (AP) or base station sharing the
wireless medium at the same time.1
Much effort has been and is currently being dedicated to large
and massive MIMO, and these techniques are coming to fruition,
yielding significant gains in network throughput. An apropos ex-
ample is Massive MIMO: in LTE cellular and 802.11ac local-area
networks, up to eight antennas are supported at the AP spatially
multiplexing [65] parallel information streams concurrently to mul-
tiple receive antennas. The technique is also known as multi-user
MIMO (MU-MIMO) and can be used both in the uplink and the
downlink of multi-user MIMO networks: in the uplink case, several
users concurrently transmit to a multi-antenna AP, while over the
downlink, the AP multiplexes different information streams to a
number of mobile users.
From a design standpoint, one of the most promising and cost
effective architectures to implement 5G technologies is the central-
ized radio access network (C-RAN) architecture [48, 60]. C-RAN
pushes most of the physical-layer processing that currently takes
place at the AP to a centralized data center, where it is aggregated
with other APs’ processing on the same hardware. The C-RAN
concept has undergone several iterations since its inception, with
more recent work treating the unique demands of small cells [63],
centralizing most of the computation and supporting hundreds or
thousands of the APs from a centralized data center.
To fully realize Massive MIMO’s potential throughput gains,
however, the system must effectively and efficiently demultiplex
mutually-interfering information streams as they arrive. Current
large MIMO designs such as Argos [62], BigStation [76], and SAM
[64] use linear processing methods such as zero-forcing and min-
imum mean squared error (MMSE) filters. These methods have
the advantage of very low computational complexity, but suffer
when the MIMO channel is poorly-conditioned [50], as is often the
case when the number of user antennas approaches the number
of antennas at the AP [50, 76]. Sphere Decoder-based maximum
likelihood (ML) MIMO decoders/detectors [10, 50] can significantly
improve throughput over such linear filters, but suffer from in-
creased computational complexity: compute requirements increase
exponentially with the number of antennas [30], soon becoming
prohibitive (Section 2.1).
The problem of limited computational capacity stems from the
requirement that a receiver’s physical layer finish decoding a frame
before the sender requires feedback about its decoding success or
failure. For Wi-Fi networks, e.g., this quantity is on the order of

tens of µs, the spacing in time between the data frame and its ac-
knowledgement. More sophisticated physical layers, such as 4G
LTE, require the receiver to give feedback in the context of incre-
mental redundancy schemes, for the same reason; the processing
time available is 3 ms for 4G LTE and 10 ms for WCDMA [19, 76].
As a result, most current systems adopt linear filters, accepting a
drop in performance.
New approach: Quantum computation in the data center. This
paper explores the leveraging of quantum computation (QC) to
speed up the computation required for the ML MIMO decoder. We
place our ideas in the context of the QC currently already realized
in experimental hardware, and in the context of the dominant C-
RAN architecture. Here we imagine a future quantum computer,
co-located with C-RAN computational resources in a data center,
connected to the APs via high-speed, low-latency fiber or millime-
ter-wave links.
Optimization is one of the key applications the quantum commu-
nity has identified as viable in the short-term (i.e. before quantum
processors become scalable devices capable of error correction
and universality). While their potential in optimization is largely
unproven, it is believed that it may be possible for Noisy Inter-
mediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to achieve polynomial or
exponential speedups over the best known classical algorithms [56].
It is, however, important to leverage understanding from current
prototypes in order to inform the design of real-world systems,
since performance cannot be predicted or simulated efficiently,
especially in the presence of device-specific noise. This is the ap-
proach we therefore advocate here. Two main approaches have
been identified for quantum optimization in NISQs: Quantum An-
nealing (QA) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms
(QAOA). The former approach is a form of analog computation
that has been developed theoretically in the early nineties [25], but
realized experimentally in a programmable device only in 2011 by
D-Wave Systems. We focus on QA here, discussing QAOA briefly
in Section 6.
This paper presents QuAMax, the first system to apply QA to the
computationally challenging ML MIMO wireless decoding problem
in the context of a centralized RAN architecture where a QA is
co-located in a data center serving one or more wireless APs. The
contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows: Firstly,
we present the first reduction of the ML MIMO decoding problem
to a form that a QA solver can process. Secondly, we introduce
a new, communications-specific evaluation metric, Time-to-BER
(TTB), which evaluates the performance of the QA as it aims to
achieve a target bit error rate (BER) on the decoded data. Finally, we
evaluate QuAMax with various scenarios and parameter settings
and test their impact on computational performance. To achieve
a BER of 10−6 and a frame error rate of 10−4, ML MIMO detec-
tion on the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer requires 10–20 µs of
computation time for 48-user, 48-AP antenna binary modulation or
30–40 µs for 14 × 14 QPSK at 20 dB SNR, and with the real-world
trace of 8×8 MIMO channel, the largest spatial multiplexing MIMO
size publicly available for experiments [61], QuAMax requires 2 µs
for BPSK and 2–10 µs for QPSK.

2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we present primer material on the MIMO ML De-
tection problem (§2.1), and Quantum Annealing (§2.2).

2.1 Primer: Maximum Likelihood Detection
Suppose there are Nt mobile users, each of which has one antenna,
each sending data bits to a multi-antenna (Nr ≥ Nt ) MIMO AP
based on OFDM, the dominant physical layer technique in broad-
band wireless communication systems [49]. Considering all users’
data bits together in a vector whose elements each comprise a
single user’s data bits, the users first map those data bits into a
complex-valued symbol ¯v that is transmitted over a radio channel:
¯v = [ ¯v1, ¯v2, . . . , ¯vNt ]⊺ ∈ CNt . Each user sends from a constellation
O of size |O| = 2Q (Q bits per symbol). The MIMO decoding prob-
lem, whose optimal solution is called the ML solution, consisting
of a search over the sets of transmitted symbols, looking for the set
that minimizes the error with respect to what has been received at
the AP:
ˆv = arg min
v∈ONt
(1)
The ML decoder then “de-maps” the decoded symbols ˆv to decoded
bits ˆb. In Eq. 1, H ∈ CNr×Nt = HI + jHQ is the wireless channel2 on
each OFDM subcarrier and y ∈ CNr (= H¯v + n) is the received set
of symbols, perturbed by n ∈ CNr , additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN). This solution minimizes detection errors, thus maximizing
throughput (i.e., throughput-optimal decoding).
The Sphere Decoder [1, 20] is a ML detector that reduces com-
plexity with respect to brute-force search by constraining its search
to only possible sets v that lie within a hypersphere of radius √
C
centered around y (i.e., Eq. 1 with constraint ∥y − Hv∥2 ≤ C).
It transforms Eq. 1 into a tree search [71] by QR decomposition

in ˆv = arg minv∈ONt ∥¯y − Rv∥2, with ¯y = Q∗y. The resulting tree

ML detection becomes the problem of finding the single leaf among

ML solution. Thus, the min in Eq. 1 is a search in an exponentially-
large space of transmitted symbols {v}, despite Sphere Decoder
reductions in the search space size [71].
Table 1 shows the average number of tree nodes visited to per-
form ML Sphere decoding, with clients transmitting modulation
symbols on 50 subcarriers over a 20 MHz, 13 dB SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) Rayleigh channel. The table is parameterized on the
number of clients and AP antennas, and the modulation, highlight-
ing the exponential increase in computation. For 8 clients with
16-QAM symbols, 15 clients with QPSK symbols, or 30 clients send-
ing binary (BPSK) symbols, the Sphere Decoder visits close to 2,000
tree nodes, saturating, for example, Intel’s Skylake core i7 architec-
ture, whose arithmetic subsystem achieves an order of magnitude
less computational throughput [32]. Since traditional silicon’s clock
speed is plateauing [14], the problem is especially acute.
2.2 Primer: Quantum Annealing
Quantum Annealers [37, 45] are specialized, analog computers
that solve NP-complete and NP-hard optimization problems on
current hardware, with future potential for substantial speedups
over conventional computing [46]. Many NP-hard problems can
be formulated in the Ising model [42] (cf. §3.2), which many QA
machines use as input [6, 18]. NP-complete and NP-hard problems
other than ML MIMO detection in the field of (wireless) networking
that potentially benefit from QA include MIMO downlink precoding
[44], channel coding [36, 75], network routing [11], security [26],
and scheduling [27, 41].
Quantum Annealing hardware. Compared to simulated anneal-
ing, the classical algorithm from which QA inherits its name, QA
aims to exploit quantum effects such as tunneling, many-body de-
localization and quantum relaxation to circumvent computational
bottlenecks that would otherwise trap Monte Carlo methods in
local minima of the solution landscape. While exploiting QA is
technologically challenging, with the appearance of the D-Wave
quantum annealer (Fig. 1), the research community is now able to
run experiments, and critically, to study under what conditions a
