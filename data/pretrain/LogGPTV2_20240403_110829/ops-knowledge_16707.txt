User: After I activated my Virtualenv i received this message:

Francos-MBP:BV francoe$source bin/activate
(BV) Francos-MBP:BV francoe$ pip freeze
-bash: /Volumes/HD 2/Projects/PythonProjects/BV/bin/pip: "/Volumes/HD: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
(BV) Francos-MBP:BV francoe$ pip install --upgrade pip -bash:
  /Volumes/HD 2/Projects/PythonProjects/BV/bin/pip: "/Volumes/HD: bad
  interpreter: No such file or directory

At the moment I am not able set up any virtualenv ..
[p.s. I have multiple versions of python (3.5 and systems version 2.7)]
Can anyone help me?
Thank you
Assistant: The space in the name of your disk ("HD 2") is tripping things up.  The path to the Python interpreter (which is going to be /Volumes/HD 2/Projects/PythonProjects/BV/bin/python) is getting split on the space, and the system is trying to execute /Volumes/HD.
You'd think that in 2016 your operating system ought to be able to deal with this.  But it can't, so you need to work around it:

Rename "HD 2" to something that doesn't contain a space.
Re-create the virtualenv.
