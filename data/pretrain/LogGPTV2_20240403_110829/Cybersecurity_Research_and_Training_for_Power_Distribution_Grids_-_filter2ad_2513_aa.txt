ABSTRACT
Mitigating cybersecurity threats in power distribution grids re-
quires a testbed for cybersecurity, e.g., to evaluate the (physical)
impact of cyberattacks, generate datasets, test and validate secu-
rity approaches, as well as train technical personnel. In this paper,
we present a blueprint for such a testbed that relies on network
emulation and power flow computation to couple real network
applications with a simulated power grid. We discuss the benefits
of our approach alongside preliminary results and various use cases
for cybersecurity research and training for power distribution grids.

1 MOTIVATION AND RELATED WORK
Power grids exhibit an increasing digitization and deployment of
communication infrastructure [11], raising their susceptibility to
advanced cyberattacks with potentially disastrous consequences [4].
Power distribution grids are especially prone to cyberattacks due to
their heterogeneity and the ongoing integration of digital assets [4].
Resulting security threats render the mitigation of and appro-
priate reaction to attacks inevitable. Unlike home or corporate
networks, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) also require to consider

physical interactions [2]. We assess that simulation is best-suited to
realistically model the physical aspects of a power grid along with
its communication infrastructure in a flexible and efficient manner.
A simulated power grid enables various cybersecurity research
and training functionalities, ultimately leading to more secure
power grids. First and foremost, investigating real-time effects of
attacks on the power grid, the communication network, and the
operator’s behavior becomes possible. Likewise, extensive datasets
of physical grid state as well as benign and malicious network traf-
fic can be created in a scalable and efficient manner, e.g, to train
intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Further, different security ap-
proaches can be tested and evaluated, e.g., to optimize deployment
of IDSs, or assess their impact on network and grid stability. Finally,
we can realize training environments in which the detection of and
reaction to cyberattacks can be trained in a realistic setting.
Consequently, simulation testbeds accompany huge potentials
for cybersecurity in power distribution grids. Different related work
already considered the so-called co-simulation of power grid and
communication from different angles [7, 8, 12], mainly with the
goal to study grid operation. Hence, these works typically either
do not precisely model communication or do not allow for an easy
integration of existing attack and defense applications. In contrast,
DSSNet [3] is a hybrid simulation-emulation testbed that allows
to execute real networking applications, but still abstracts from ac-
tual used communication protocols in the energy sector. Although
MiniCPS [2] provides a toolkit for cybersecurity research and train-
ing for CPSs, it does not support power grids. Thus, a comprehen-
sive environment for cybersecurity in power grids is missing.
In this paper, we present a blueprint for a testbed for cybersecu-
rity in power grids and substantiate its benefits alongside various
use cases. Specifically focusing on power distribution grids along
with the widely used IEC 60870-5-104 protocol, we propose to com-
bine the (communication) network emulator Mininet [6] with the
power flow solver pandapower [10] to couple real network applica-
tions with a simulated power grid. Hence, we target use cases in
cybersecurity research ranging from attack and security evaluations
over dataset generation to teaching and training.
2 BLUEPRINT FOR A SECURITY TESTBED
A cybersecurity testbed for power distribution grids needs to model
the physical power grid and the communication network. In our
blueprint, we propose to realize these components separately and
introduce a dedicated coordinator that mediates between the indi-
vidual simulations to ensure realistic mutual interactions (cf. Fig. 1).
Figure 1: Overview on our proposed architecture blueprint at the example of a CIGRE power network [9] and an excerpt of
the corresponding communication network. We indicate logical mappings between the communication network hosts and
the power grid components exemplarily, e.g, RTU RA controls and monitors transformer TA in the power grid.
2.1 Power Grid and Network Topologies
To authentically replicate power distribution grids, we require in-
formation on both, the topology of the physical power grid (prop-
erties and interconnections of devices such as lines, transformers,
or loads) and the communication network used to interconnect
these physical assets (information on hosts such as Remote and
Master Terminal Units (RTUs / MTUs)1, and infrastructure such
as routers and switches along with their configurations). While
realistic information on power grid topology models is publicly
available [10], models for corresponding communication networks
and their configuration are missing [5]. Consequently, our blue-
print relies on a smart grid architecture model-based approach [5]
to automatically derive a communication network topology and its
configuration from a power grid model. The resulting topologies,
as well as linking information, enable us to derive a concurrent
simulation environment for cybersecurity research and training.
2.2 Communication Network Emulation
To allow for the execution of real network applications as required
by various research and training tasks, we propose to rely on com-
munication network emulation instead of the simulation approach
taken by most related work (cf. §1). More precisely, we propose to
use Mininet [6] to represent and interconnect network components
such as RTUs and MTUs (communicating over IEC 60870-5-104),
network switches and routers, and hosts providing additional cyber-
security functionality, e.g, IDSs, as illustrated in Figure 1. Mininet
enables flexible configuration of network parameters, covering link
latencies, jitter, bandwidth, interface properties as well as flow rules
and routing tables, while further providing support for software-
defined networking. Due to the low-level representation of the
network, i.e, down to individual interfaces, we can achieve a high
degree of realism and execute real networking applications.
2.3 Power Distribution Grid Simulation
In contrast to the communication network emulation which oper-
ates in real-time, power distribution grid simulation only has to be
performed upon switching operations, changes in power consump-
tion or generation which can be modeled by time series data, or
other well-defined external events. Consequently, we propose to
1MTUs receive monitoring information from RTUs and issue control commands to
