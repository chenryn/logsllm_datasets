**Abstract:**
Mitigating cybersecurity threats in power distribution grids requires a testbed for evaluating the physical impact of cyberattacks, generating datasets, testing and validating security approaches, and training technical personnel. This paper presents a blueprint for such a testbed, which leverages network emulation and power flow computation to integrate real network applications with a simulated power grid. We discuss the benefits of our approach, present preliminary results, and explore various use cases for cybersecurity research and training in power distribution grids.

**1. Motivation and Related Work:**
Power grids are increasingly digitized and rely on communication infrastructure, making them more susceptible to advanced cyberattacks with potentially catastrophic consequences [4]. Power distribution grids, in particular, are vulnerable due to their heterogeneity and the ongoing integration of digital assets [4]. Addressing these security threats is crucial, as cyber-physical systems (CPSs) require consideration of both cyber and physical interactions [2].

Simulation is an effective method for realistically modeling the physical aspects of a power grid and its communication infrastructure. A simulated power grid can support various cybersecurity research and training functionalities, leading to more secure power grids. It allows for the investigation of real-time effects of attacks on the power grid, communication network, and operator behavior. Additionally, it enables the creation of extensive datasets of physical grid states and network traffic, which can be used to train intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Different security approaches can also be tested and evaluated, and realistic training environments can be created for detecting and responding to cyberattacks.

While existing work has explored co-simulation of power grids and communication networks [7, 8, 12], these studies often do not accurately model communication or easily integrate attack and defense applications. DSSNet [3] and MiniCPS [2] offer some capabilities but do not fully support power grids. Therefore, a comprehensive environment for cybersecurity in power grids is still lacking.

In this paper, we present a blueprint for a testbed for cybersecurity in power grids, focusing on power distribution grids and the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. Our approach combines the network emulator Mininet [6] with the power flow solver pandapower [10] to couple real network applications with a simulated power grid, addressing a range of use cases from attack and security evaluations to dataset generation and training.

**2. Blueprint for a Security Testbed:**
A cybersecurity testbed for power distribution grids must model both the physical power grid and the communication network. Our blueprint proposes to realize these components separately and introduce a dedicated coordinator to mediate between the individual simulations, ensuring realistic mutual interactions (Figure 1).

**2.1 Power Grid and Network Topologies:**
To authentically replicate power distribution grids, we need information on the topology of the physical power grid (properties and interconnections of devices such as lines, transformers, and loads) and the communication network (information on hosts such as Remote and Master Terminal Units (RTUs/MTUs) and infrastructure such as routers and switches along with their configurations). While realistic power grid topology models are publicly available [10], corresponding communication network models and configurations are missing [5]. Our blueprint uses a smart grid architecture model-based approach [5] to automatically derive a communication network topology and its configuration from a power grid model. The resulting topologies and linking information enable us to create a concurrent simulation environment for cybersecurity research and training.

**2.2 Communication Network Emulation:**
To allow for the execution of real network applications, we propose using communication network emulation instead of simulation. Specifically, we suggest using Mininet [6] to represent and interconnect network components such as RTUs and MTUs (communicating over IEC 60870-5-104), network switches and routers, and hosts providing additional cybersecurity functionality, such as IDSs (Figure 1). Mininet supports flexible configuration of network parameters, including link latencies, jitter, bandwidth, interface properties, flow rules, and routing tables, and provides support for software-defined networking. This low-level representation of the network allows for a high degree of realism and the execution of real networking applications.

**2.3 Power Distribution Grid Simulation:**
Unlike the real-time operation of the communication network emulation, power distribution grid simulation only needs to be performed during switching operations, changes in power consumption or generation (modeled by time series data), or other well-defined external events. We propose using pandapower [10] for this purpose, which can simulate the power grid's response to these events. This approach ensures that the testbed can handle both the dynamic nature of the communication network and the event-driven nature of the power grid.

**Note:** MTUs receive monitoring information from RTUs and issue control commands to them.
