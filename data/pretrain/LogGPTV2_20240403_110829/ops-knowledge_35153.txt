User: I have written a python script on my local laptop which uses several third party packages. I now want to run my script regularly (via a cron job) on an external server. 
The external server most likely does not have all the dependencies installed, is there is a way to package and deploy my python script and dependencies in order to ensure that it will run?
I have already tried to package the script as an exe, but failed to do so.
Assistant: Just turn your computer into a server. Simply set up your router for port forwarding so that your server's content's will display when the router's IP is entered. You can of course purchase a DNS domain to give that IP a human readable URL.
