While obtaining Ansible through a "quick and dirty" method is highly useful for rapid prototyping and hacking scenarios, integrating it into other projects necessitates a more structured setup process. Specifically, the ability to install Ansible via `easy_install` or `pip` is essential for seamless integration.

Publishing each new release of Ansible on PyPI (Python Package Index) would greatly facilitate this, ensuring that developers can easily and reliably include it in their projects.
