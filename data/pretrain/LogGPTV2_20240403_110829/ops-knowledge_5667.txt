Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of launching an application. The StackScrollAlgorithm is updated with clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive overlap. The PhoneStatusBar is updated with notification shade and the PanelView is closed. The ActivityManager is called to start the activity with a new task and the PowerManagerService is called to acquire a lock. Finally, the PhoneStatusBar is updated with expanded visibility set to false.
