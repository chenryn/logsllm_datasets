**ATT&CK ID:** T1566.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Spearphishing via Service

Adversaries may use third-party services to send spearphishing messages in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to victim systems. This technique, known as "Spearphishing via Service," is a specific variant of spearphishing. Unlike traditional spearphishing, which typically involves direct communication through enterprise email channels, this method leverages external services to deliver the malicious content. By using these third-party platforms, attackers can bypass some email security measures and increase the likelihood of their messages being delivered and acted upon.
