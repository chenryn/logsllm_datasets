User: I'm experimenting with the Google cloud storage backup feature for an application.
After downloading the backup files using gsutil, how can they be loaded into a local development server?
Is there a parser available for these formats (eg, protocol buffers)?
Assistant: For those using windows change the open line to:
raw = open('path_to_datastore_export_file', 'rb')
The file must be opened in binary mode!
