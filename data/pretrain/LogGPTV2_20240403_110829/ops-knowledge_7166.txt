I am currently experimenting with the Google Cloud Storage backup feature for an application. After downloading the backup files using `gsutil`, how can I load them into a local development server? Additionally, is there a parser available for these formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers)?

**Response:**

To load the backup files into a local development server, you need to ensure that the file is opened in binary mode. For users on Windows, modify the `open` line as follows:

```python
raw = open('path_to_datastore_export_file', 'rb')
```

The file must be opened in binary mode (`'rb'`) to correctly read the data.

For parsing the backup files, if they are in a format like Protocol Buffers, you can use the `protobuf` library. Ensure you have the corresponding `.proto` files and the necessary Python or other language bindings to parse the data.

If you need further assistance with specific steps or additional details, feel free to ask.
