### Bug report
**Bug summary**  
`matplotlib.pyplot` isn't friendly to remotely run commands with no X server:
    In [1]: import matplotlib.pyplot
    In [2]: QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display 
    Aborted
However, selecting the backend before hand fixes the problem:
    In [1]: import matplotlib
    In [2]: matplotlib.use("Agg")
    In [3]: import matplotlib.pyplot
I am not very familiar, but could there be some check of the display module
before importing? My problem is I obtain this error when running on a remote
server with no X11 forwarding and importing a library that by default imports
`maplotlib.pyplot`. (The library is `pims` )
**Matplotlib version**
  * Operating System: Linux (Debian)
  * Matplotlib Version: 1.5.3
  * Python Version: 3.5.3
  * IPython Version : 5.1.0
I installed matplotlib via pip.
