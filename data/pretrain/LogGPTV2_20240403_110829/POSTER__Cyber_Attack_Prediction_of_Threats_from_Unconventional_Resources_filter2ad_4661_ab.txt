### Determination of Ground Truth and Optimal Parameters

The ground truth is determined for each signal and attack type. This process is repeated, and the optimal aggregation time (At) and lead time (Lt) parameters are identified for each signal-attack type pair, as shown in Table 1. We observe that different signals may have significantly different aggregation and lead times for various attack types.

### Recalculation and Training of Bayesian Classifiers

Based on the determined At and Lt values for each attack type, the signals are recalculated. These recalculated signals are then used to train a Bayesian classifier for each attack type using the corresponding binary ground truth data. The performance of each Bayesian model is evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is higher when the true positive rate is high and the false positive rate is low. The FilteredClassifier in Weka [4] is used to apply SMOTE++ and train a Bayesian classifier for each attack type with 10 × 10 folds cross-validation.

**Table 2: AUC Values for Each Attack Type Using Different Signal Configurations**

| Attack Type | Signals with At and Lt | Signals with At Only |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| MW          | 0.82                   | 0.51                 |
| Scan        | 0.51                   | 0.51                 |
| Def         | 0.78                   | 0.67                 |
| MU          | 0.61                   | 0.56                 |
| ME          | 0.57                   | 0.69                 |
| DoS         | 0.66                   | 0.64                 |

To assess the significance of using Lt, a new set of signals (Signals with At) was calculated based on the At found with CCR and Lt = 0. The AUC values for these models are shown in the second row of Table 2. A t-test with a p-value of 0.05 was applied, and it was observed that the differences in AUC values were significant for the Scan, Def, and DoS attack types. Using a lead time for the aggregated signals improved the performance for some attack types, but further research with different datasets is needed to generalize these findings.

### Conclusion

Evaluations with the ground truth data from the anonymized company K5 demonstrate the capability of CAPTURE. The results show that unconventional signals, not directly related to a target entity, can be used to forecast cyber attacks. Cross-correlation analysis is useful in determining the aggregation and lead times of the signals, and using a lead time can improve the forecast performance.
