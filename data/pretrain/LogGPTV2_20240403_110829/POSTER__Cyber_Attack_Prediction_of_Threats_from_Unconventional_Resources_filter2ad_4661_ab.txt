and the ground truth are determined. This process is repeated for
each signal and attack type, and the optimum At and Lt parameters
shown in Table 1 are found for each signal and attack type pair. We
observe that different signals might have quite different aggregation
and lead times for different attack types. The signals defined in 2.1

attack type. TS denotes Time Series signals (TS_MW_F and
TS_MW_C denote the forecasted count and confidence re-
spectively for Malware attacks).

are recalculated based on the found At and Lt for each attack type.
The recalculated signals are then used to train a Bayesian classifier
for each attack type using its corresponding binary ground truth.
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) gets better, when the true
positive rate is high and false positive rate is low. Therefore, AUC
is used to check the performance of each Bayesian model for each
attack type. FilteredClassifier in Weka [4] is used to apply SMOTE++
and train a Bayesian classifier for each attack type with 10 × 10
folds cross validation. When the aggregated signals (Signals with
At and Lt) are used, the AUC values shown in the first row of Table
2 are found for each attack type. To check the significance of using
Table 2: The AUC values found for each attack type for two
cases.

Lt, a new set of signals (Signals with At) were calculated based on
the At found with CCR and Lt = 0. With these signals, the AUC
values of the Bayesian models for each attack type are shown in the
second row of Table 2. We apply a t-test with a p-value of 0.05 and
observe that the differences in the AUC values are significant for
the Scan, Def and DoS attack types. We observe that using a lead
time for the aggregated signals could improve the performance for
some attack types, but believe that further research with different
data sets is needed to generalize our findings.
4 CONCLUSION
The evaluations with the ground truth data of the anonymized
company K5 illustrates the capability of CAPTURE. The results
show that unconventional signals that are not directly related to
a target entity, could be used to forecast cyber attacks towards it.
Furthermore, cross correlation analysis is useful in determining
the aggregation and lead times of the signals and using a lead time
could improve the forecast performance.
