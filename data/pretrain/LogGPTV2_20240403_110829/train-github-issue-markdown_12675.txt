I'm working on a PR, #32748, for a macro wraps `ccall` in more Julia-like
syntax. An issue that's being discussed a lot is the accommodation of varargs
of different types. I had the impression from @vtjnash that this was supported
by `foreigncall`, but in retrospect, it's possible I misunderstood what he was
saying.
I'm not in a position to implement this myself without first learning Scheme
and LLVM. I should really do those things, but it may not be the most
efficient way to get this change in.
