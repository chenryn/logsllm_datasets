I tryed make popovers for radio buttons with trigger on hover, but i have a
bug with inline buttons. When i mouse in on the button, after that i have one
little space. On mouse out it's removes. Last element of radio buttons loses a
border radius on mouse hover. See my fiddle for more information.
PS: Sorry for my bad english
