I attempted to create popovers for radio buttons that are triggered on hover, but I encountered an issue with inline buttons. When I hover over a button, a small space appears. This space disappears when the mouse is moved away. Additionally, the last radio button loses its border radius when hovered over. For more details, please see my fiddle.

P.S. I apologize for any language errors in my original message.
