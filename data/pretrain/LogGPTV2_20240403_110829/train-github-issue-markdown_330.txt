I have thoroughly searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Context

Currently, I am using the `Menu` component to render a custom context menu on a right-click mouse event. The menu should appear relative to the cursor's position. To achieve this, it would be beneficial to pass additional `x, y` props to the `Popover` component, which would adjust the `Menu`'s position relative to the `anchorEl`. Is this a good approach? Or is there a more effective way to implement this functionality?

#### Environment Details

- **Material-UI:** v1.0.0-beta.17
- **React:** v16.0.0
- **Browser:** Google Chrome 61.0.3163.100

Thank you for your assistance!
