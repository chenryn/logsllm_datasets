Other cool stuff

Things we DON'T do
 Sniffing on any interface types
  Put 802.11 interfaces in monitor mode (hence 
not checking for de-auths and such)
  WPA/WEP Cracking 
  Detect client or AP authentication failed

(some of the) design challenges
 Easy to install and use
  Comprehensive
 Scanning time differences per adapter
 Madwifi “caching” issue
  Make it with as few dependencies as 
possible
