### Managing Directory Access

#### Enabling or Disabling BSD Flat File and NIS Directory Services
Files are the original method for accessing administrative data on UNIX computers, and some organizations still use them. Some UNIX servers use Network Information Service (NIS) to provide directory services.

To enable or disable BSD flat file and NIS directory services:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Check or uncheck the box next to "BSD Flat File and NIS" and click **Apply**.

For configuration instructions, refer to “Accessing an NIS Domain” on page 107 and “Using BSD Configuration Files” on page 108.

#### Enabling or Disabling LDAP Directory Services
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable access to directory services that use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3. A single Directory Access plug-in named LDAPv3 provides access to both LDAP versions 2 and 3. (The LDAPv2 plug-in of Mac OS X version 10.2 is not needed with Mac OS X version 10.3.)

Mac OS X Server version 10.3 and later provides only LDAPv3 directory service to other computers, including Mac OS X computers. Mac OS X Server version 10.2 can provide LDAPv3 directory service to other computers (and it can also provide NetInfo directory service). Many other servers also provide LDAPv3 directory service; LDAPv3 is an open standard common in mixed networks of Macintosh, UNIX, and Windows systems. Some servers also use the older version, LDAPv2, to provide directory service.

To enable or disable LDAP directory services:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Check or uncheck the box next to **LDAPv3** and click **Apply**.

For configuration instructions, see “Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90.

---

#### Enabling or Disabling NetInfo Directory Services
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable access to shared NetInfo directory domains. NetInfo is a legacy directory service that is still used for the local directory domain on every Mac OS X computer, including Mac OS X Server. NetInfo can also be used for a shared directory domain of Mac OS X Server version 10.2 and earlier. Disabling NetInfo in Directory Access does not disable access to the computer’s local NetInfo domain. Only access to shared NetInfo domains can be disabled.

To enable or disable NetInfo directory services:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Check or uncheck the box next to **NetInfo** and click **Apply**.

For configuration instructions, see “Accessing Legacy NetInfo Domains” on page 109.

---

#### Enabling or Disabling Rendezvous Service Discovery
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable the discovery of some Rendezvous network services. For example, disabling Rendezvous in Directory Access prevents Rendezvous-enabled file servers from appearing in the Network globe in the Finder. However, it does not prevent Rendezvous-enabled printers from appearing in the Printer Setup Utility or prevent iTunes from using Rendezvous for music sharing. Rendezvous is an Apple protocol for discovering file, print, and other services on Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

To enable or disable Rendezvous service discovery:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Check or uncheck the box next to **Rendezvous** and click **Apply**.

Rendezvous does not require additional configuration.

---

#### Enabling or Disabling SLP Service Discovery
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable the discovery of services that use Service Location Protocol (SLP) to make themselves known on the network. SLP is an open standard for discovering file and print services on IP networks.

To enable or disable SLP service discovery:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Check or uncheck the box next to **SLP** and click **Apply**.

SLP does not require additional configuration.

---

#### Enabling or Disabling SMB Service Discovery
You can use Directory Access to enable or disable the discovery of services that use Server Message Block (SMB) to make themselves known on the network. SMB is a protocol used by Microsoft Windows for file and print services.

To enable or disable SMB service discovery:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Check or uncheck the box next to **SMB** and click **Apply**.

For configuration instructions, see “Configuring SMB Service Discovery” on page 87.

---

#### Configuring SMB Service Discovery
You can configure how Mac OS X uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to discover Windows file servers on the network. You can use the Directory Access application to specify the following:
- The Windows workgroup that the computer is a member of.
- A Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) server on the network.

To configure discovery of Windows SMB file servers:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Select **SMB** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
5. In the **Workgroup** field, type a workgroup name or select one from the drop-down list. The drop-down list includes the names of Windows workgroups that other computers on the network are members of.
6. Enter the DNS name or IP address of a WINS server that provides NetBIOS name resolution for the network, then click **OK**.

A WINS Server resolves Windows computer names to IP addresses on a network with routers and multiple subnets. If the network does not have a WINS server, leave the WINS Server field blank.

#### Setting Up the Authentication and Contacts Search Policies
Directory Access defines an authentication search policy and a contacts search policy.
- **Authentication Search Policy:** Mac OS X uses this policy to locate and retrieve user authentication information and other administrative data from directory domains.
- **Contacts Search Policy:** Mac OS X uses this policy to locate and retrieve name, address, and other contact information from directory domains. Mac OS X Address Book and other applications can use this contact information.

Each search policy consists of a list of directory domains (also known as directory nodes). The order of directory domains in the list defines the search policy. Starting at the top of the list, Mac OS X searches each listed directory domain in turn until it either finds the information it needs or reaches the end of the list without finding the information.

Each search policy, authentication and contacts, can be set to **Automatic**, **Local directory**, or **Custom path**.
- **Automatic:** Starts with the local directory domain and can include an LDAP directory supplied automatically by DHCP and NetInfo domains to which the computer is bound. This is the default setting for Mac OS X version 10.2 and later and offers the most flexibility for mobile computers.
- **Local directory:** Includes only the local directory domain.
- **Custom path:** Starts with the local directory domain and includes your choice of LDAP directories, an Active Directory domain, NetInfo domains, BSD configuration files, and an NIS domain.

---

#### Defining Automatic Search Policies
Using Directory Access, you can configure a Mac OS X computer’s authentication and contacts search policies to be defined automatically. An automatically defined search policy includes the local directory domain. It can also include an LDAP directory server specified by DHCP service and shared NetInfo domains to which the computer is bound. This is the default configuration for both the authentication and the contacts search policy.

To have a search policy defined automatically:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Authentication** or **Contacts**.
   - **Authentication:** Shows the search policy used for authentication and most other administrative data.
   - **Contacts:** Shows the search policy used for contact information in applications such as Address Book.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Choose **Automatic** from the **Search** pop-up menu, then click **Apply**.
5. In System Preferences, ensure the computer’s Network preferences are configured to use DHCP or DHCP with manual IP address.
6. If you want the DHCP service of Mac OS X Server to supply its clients with a particular LDAP server’s address for their automatic search policies, you need to configure the LDAP options of DHCP service. For instructions, see the DHCP chapter of the network services administration guide.

---

#### Defining Custom Search Policies
Using Directory Access, you can configure a Mac OS X computer’s authentication and contacts search policies to use a custom list of directory domains. A custom list starts with the computer’s local directory domain and can also include Open Directory and other LDAP directory domains, an Active Directory domain, shared NetInfo domains, BSD configuration files, and an NIS domain.

Note: Ensure the computer has been configured to access the LDAP directories, Active Directory domain, NetInfo domains, and NIS domain that you want to add to the search policy. For instructions, see the subsequent sections of this chapter.

To specify a custom list of directory domains for a search policy:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Authentication** or **Contacts**.
   - **Authentication:** Shows the search policy used for authentication and most other administrative data.
   - **Contacts:** Shows the search policy used for contact information in applications such as Address Book.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Choose **Custom path** from the **Search** pop-up menu.
5. Add directory domains as needed.
   - Click **Add**, select one or more directories, and click **Add** again.
6. Change the order of the listed directory domains as needed, and remove listed directory domains that you don’t want in the search policy.
   - Move a directory domain by dragging it up or down the list.
   - Remove a listed directory domain by selecting it and clicking **Remove**.
7. Click **Apply**.

---

#### Defining Local Directory Search Policies
Using Directory Access, you can configure a Mac OS X computer’s authentication and contacts search policies to use only the computer’s local directory domain. A search policy that uses only the local directory limits the access that a computer has to authentication information and other administrative data. If you restrict a computer’s authentication search policy to use only the local directory, only users with local accounts can log in.

To have a search policy use only the local directory domain:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Authentication** or **Contacts**.
   - **Authentication:** Shows the search policy used for authentication and most other administrative data.
   - **Contacts:** Shows the search policy used for contact information in applications such as Address Book.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Choose **Local directory** from the **Search** pop-up menu, then click **Apply**.

#### Accessing LDAP Directories
You can configure a server with Mac OS X Server or a computer with Mac OS X to access specific LDAP directories, including the LDAP directory of a Mac OS X Server Open Directory master. For task descriptions and instructions, see:
- “Enabling or Disabling Use of a DHCP-Supplied LDAP Directory” (next)
- “Showing or Hiding Options for LDAP Directories” on page 91
- “Configuring Access to an LDAP Directory” on page 92
- “Changing a Configuration for Accessing an LDAP Directory” on page 93
- “Duplicating a Configuration for Accessing an LDAP Directory” on page 93
- “Deleting a Configuration for Accessing an LDAP Directory” on page 94
- “Changing the Connection Settings for an LDAP Directory” on page 95
- “Configuring LDAP Searches and Mappings” on page 96
- “Mapping Config Record Attributes for LDAP Directories” on page 98
- “Editing RFC 2307 Mapping to Enable Creating Users” on page 98
- “Populating LDAP Directories With Data for Mac OS X” on page 100

In Mac OS X version 10.3, a single Directory Access plug-in named LDAPv3 provides access to both LDAP versions 2 and 3. The LDAPv2 plug-in of Mac OS X version 10.2 is not needed with Mac OS X version 10.3. Existing LDAPv2 configurations are automatically converted to LDAPv3 when a computer is upgraded to Mac OS X version 10.3.

Note: Mac OS X Mail, Address Book, and some similar applications can access LDAP directories directly, without using Open Directory. You can configure these applications to search specific LDAP directories. For instructions, open Mail and choose Help > Mail Help or open Address Book and choose Help > Address Book Help; then search for help on LDAP.

---

#### Enabling or Disabling Use of a DHCP-Supplied LDAP Directory
Using Directory Access, you can configure a Mac OS X computer to get the address of an LDAP directory server automatically when it starts up. Mac OS X requests the address of an LDAP directory server from the DHCP service that also supplies the computer’s IP address, router address, and DNS server addresses. Mac OS X adds the LDAP server’s address supplied by DHCP to the computer’s automatic search policy. See “Defining Automatic Search Policies” on page 88 for more information.

To enable or disable automatic access to an LDAP server:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Select **LDAPv3** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
5. Click **Use DHCP-supplied LDAP Server**.
   - If you disable this setting, the computer doesn’t use an LDAP directory server supplied by DHCP. However, the computer can automatically access shared NetInfo domains. See “Accessing Legacy NetInfo Domains” on page 109 for more information.
   - If you enable this setting, the DHCP service should be configured to supply the address of an LDAP directory server. For instructions, see the DHCP chapter of the network services administration guide.

---

#### Showing or Hiding Options for LDAP Directories
You can show or hide a list of available configurations for accessing LDAP directories. Each configuration specifies how Open Directory accesses a particular LDAP directory. When you show the list, you can view and change some settings for each LDAP configuration.

To show or hide the available LDAP directory configurations:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Select **LDAPv3** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
5. Click the **Show Options** control or the **Hide Options** control, whichever is present.

---

#### Configuring Access to an LDAP Directory
You can use Directory Access to create a configuration that specifies how Mac OS X accesses a particular LDAPv3 or LDAPv2 directory.

To create a configuration for accessing an LDAP directory:
1. Open Directory Access.
2. Click **Services**.
3. If the lock icon is locked, click it and enter the administrator's name and password.
4. Select **LDAPv3** in the list of services, then click **Configure**.
5. If the list of LDAP directory configurations is hidden, click **Show Options**.
6. Click **New** and enter a name for the configuration.
7. Press Tab and enter the DNS name or IP address of the server that hosts the LDAP directory you want to access.
8. Click the pop-up menu next to the DNS name or IP address and choose a mapping template or choose **From Server**.
9. Enter the search base suffix for the LDAP directory and click **OK**.
   - If you chose a template in step 8, you must enter a search base suffix, or the computer will not be able to find information in the LDAP directory. Typically, the search base suffix is derived from the server’s DNS name. For example, the search base suffix could be “dc=example, dc=com” for a server whose DNS name is server.example.com.
   - If you chose **From Server** in step 8, you don’t need to enter a search base. In this case, Open Directory assumes the search base is the first level of the LDAP directory.
10. Select the **SSL** checkbox if you want Open Directory to use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for connections with the LDAP directory.
11. If you want the computer to access the LDAP directory for which you just created a configuration, you must add the directory to a custom search policy in the **Authentication** or **Contacts** pane of Directory Access. You must also make sure **LDAPv3** is enabled in the **Services** pane. For instructions, see “Enabling or Disabling LDAP Directory Services” on page 85 and “Defining Custom Search Policies” on page 89.

Note: Before you can use Workgroup Manager to create users on a non-Apple LDAP server that uses RFC 2307 (UNIX) mappings, you must edit the mapping of the Users record type. For instructions, see “Editing RFC 2307 Mapping to Enable Creating Users” on page 98.

   - **Enable:** Click a checkbox to enable or disable access to an LDAP directory server.
   - **Configuration Name:** Double-click a configuration name to edit it.
   - **Server Name or IP Address:** Double-click a server name or IP address to change it.
   - **LDAP Mapping:** Choose a template from the pop-up menu, then enter the search base for the LDAP directory and click **OK**.
     - If you chose a template, you must enter a search base suffix, or the computer will not be able to find information in the LDAP directory. Typically, the search base suffix is derived from the server’s DNS name. For example, the search base suffix could be “dc=example, dc=com” for a server whose DNS name is server.example.com.
     - If you chose **From Server** instead of a template, you don’t need to enter a search base. In this case, Open Directory assumes the search base is the first level of the LDAP directory.
   - **SSL:** Click a checkbox to enable or disable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections.

---

#### Duplicating a Configuration for Accessing an LDAP Directory
You can use Directory Access to duplicate a configuration that specifies how Mac OS X accesses a particular LDAPv3 or LDAPv2 directory. After duplicating an LDAP directory configuration, you can change its settings to make it different from the original configuration.
