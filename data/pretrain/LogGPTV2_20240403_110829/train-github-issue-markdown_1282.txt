### Detailed Description
I downloaded an `.mkv` video from YouTube and attempted to read it using `cv2.VideoCapture(path)` in a Python script within Visual Studio Code. However, I encountered the following warning messages, and the video could not be decoded:

```
[av1 @ 0000028a88053c40] Your platform doesnâ€™t support hardware-accelerated AV1 decoding.
[av1 @ 0000028a88053c40] Failed to get pixel format.

```

After posting this issue on the OpenCV forum, it was suggested that the problem might be related to the `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg460_64.dll` file, which does not include support for AV1 decoding. It was recommended that updating the `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg460_64.dll` file might resolve the issue.

### Summary
- **Issue:** Unable to decode an `.mkv` video with AV1 codec using `cv2.VideoCapture`.
- **Possible Cause:** The `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg460_64.dll` file lacks support for AV1 decoding.
- **Suggested Solution:** Update the `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg460_64.dll` file to a version that includes AV1 support.
