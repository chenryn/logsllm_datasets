### Reliability of Top-of-Rack (ToR) Switches
ToR switches exhibit low failure rates, often among the lowest across all devices. This observation indicates that low-cost, commodity switches can be as reliable as their more expensive, higher-capacity counterparts. This is particularly encouraging for data center networking proposals that emphasize the use of commodity switches to build flat data center networks [3, 12, 21].

### Link Failure Analysis
Load balancer links have the highest rate of logged failures. Figure 5 illustrates the failure probability for interface types with a population size of at least 500. Load balancer links are the most likely to experience failures, often due to issues with the load balancer devices themselves.

- **Core and ISC Links**: These links, which are higher in the network topology, have the second-highest failure rate, with approximately a 1 in 10 chance of failure. However, these failures are often masked by network redundancy.
- **Trunk Links**: Lower in the topology, trunk links have a much lower failure rate of about 5%.

**Management and Inter-Data Center Links**:
- **Inter-Data Center (IX) Links**: Highly reliable, with fewer than 3% failing.
- **Management Links**: Also highly reliable, with fewer than 3% failing.

These links are critical for network performance and are backed up to ensure that the failure of a subset of links does not impact end-to-end performance.

### Aggregate Impact of Failures
In this section, we analyze the total number of failure events and total downtime for different device types. Figure 6 presents the percentage of failures and downtime for various device types.

- **Load Balancers (LBs)**: Have the highest number of failures, with half of the top six devices in terms of failures being load balancers. However, LBs do not experience the most downtime.
- **Top-of-Rack (ToR) Switches**: Experience the most downtime, despite having very low failure probabilities. This is due to three factors:
  1. LBs are subject to more frequent software faults and upgrades.
  2. ToRs are the most prevalent device type in the network, increasing their aggregate effect on failure events and downtime.
  3. ToRs are not a high-priority component for repair due to in-built failover techniques, such as replicating data and compute across multiple racks, which aim to maintain high service availability despite failures.

### Network Link Failures
Figure 7 shows the normalized number of failures and downtime for the six most failure-prone link types.

- **Load Balancer Links**: Experience the second-highest number of failures but relatively small downtime. This suggests that failures for LBs are short-lived and intermittent, often caused by transient software bugs rather than severe hardware issues.
- **ISC, MGMT, and CORE Links**: All experience approximately 5% of failures.

### Failure Characteristics
Table 5 provides the mean, median, 99th percentile, and coefficient of variation (COV) for the number of failures observed per device over a year (for devices that experienced at least one failure).

- **Load Balancers**: A few outlier LB devices experience more than 400 failures, while most LBs experience a highly variable number of failures.
- **ToRs**: Experience little variability in the number of failures, with most ToRs experiencing between 1 and 4 failures.

### Properties of Failures
This section examines the properties of failures for network element types that experienced the highest number of events.

#### Time to Repair
The time to repair (or duration) for failures is calculated as the time between a down notification and when the network element is reported as back online. Short-duration failures are often resolved automatically, while long-lived failures may be skewed by when NOC tickets are closed.

- **Load Balancers**: Experience short-lived failures.
- **Link Failures**: Many link failures are resolved automatically, as indicated by the grouping of durations around four minutes in Figure 9(a).

### Summary
- **ToR Switches**: Low failure rates, high prevalence, and in-built failover techniques.
- **Load Balancers**: High number of failures but short-lived, often due to software issues.
- **Core and ISC Links**: Higher failure rates but masked by redundancy.
- **Trunk, Management, and Inter-Data Center Links**: Highly reliable with low failure rates.

Figures 8 and 9 provide detailed visualizations of the properties of device and link failures, including time to repair, time between failures, and annualized downtime.
