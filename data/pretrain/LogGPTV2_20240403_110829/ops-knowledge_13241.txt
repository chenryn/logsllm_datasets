Assistant: Existence of exception: Existence of exception Exception type: hardware exception Exception reason/solution: The error log is the RAS KERNEL INFO log generated by the IBM RS/6000 AIX operating system, showing that an instruction cache parity error has occurred and has been automatically corrected. This error is caused by a hardware exception, which may be an error in the execution of a CPU instruction, or a failure of a hardware component such as a system power supply. You should check the system hardware status to confirm whether the CPU, memory and other hardware components are normal. If a hardware component is faulty, the faulty part needs to be replaced, and if the hardware is normal, a complete system check of the system needs to be performed. After checking, the operating system needs to be restarted to restore the service.
