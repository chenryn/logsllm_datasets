There seems to be a bug when plotting dataframes that has duplicates in a
DatetimeIndex. It seems to only be triggered when there is at least one more
non-duplicate item in the index as in the first two cases below. These result
in a:
    ValueError: Shape of passed values is (1, 3), indices imply (1, 2)
While the last case seems to be fine.
        # Case 1: fails 
        df = pandas.DataFrame(
            index = pandas.to_datetime([
                "2002-07-18 13:49:49",
                "2002-07-18 13:49:49",
                "2002-07-18 10:38:58"
            ]),
            data = [1, 1, 1]
        )
        df.plot()
        # Case 2: fails
        df = pandas.DataFrame(
            index = pandas.to_datetime([
                "2002-07-19 10:51:29",
                "2002-07-18 13:49:49",
                "2002-07-18 13:49:49",
            ]),
            data = [1, 1, 1]
        )
        df.plot()
        # Case 3: works
        df = pandas.DataFrame(
            index = pandas.to_datetime([
                "2002-07-18 13:49:49",
                "2002-07-18 13:49:49",
            ]),
            data = [1, 1]
        )
        df.plot()
