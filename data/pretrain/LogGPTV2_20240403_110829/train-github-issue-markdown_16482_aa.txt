I saw an issue with aggs not working when upgrading from 1.4.4 to 1.5.1. I was
able to reproduce with generic data in both a linux server (ubuntu on
CircleCI) and OS X on my laptop locally. (nice to have CI)
After some debugging, I was able to narrow it down to adding a second mapping
where the second mapping's doc type has the same name as the first mapping's
nested object. The following script below will return `0` or `null` aggs
results for the `stats` aggregation in 1.5.1 when the second mapping is
applied. Without the second mapping, this isn't an issue, and in 1.4.4 this
isn't an issue.
Cheers,
