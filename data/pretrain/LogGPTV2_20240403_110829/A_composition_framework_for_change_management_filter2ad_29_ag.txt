#### 2.2.1 Inputs
To complete the Leadership Support activities in the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:

- **Project Sponsorship Assessment**: This assessment, completed by the OCM Practitioner during the Concept Process Phase, provides guidance in identifying the Sponsor’s level of availability, interest, and knowledge of the change initiative.
- **OCM Schedule**: Created in the OCM Lifecycle Management Knowledge Area, this schedule identifies the timeline for OCM activities, which is helpful in defining the Sponsor’s role.
- **RACI Matrix**: Developed as part of the CA-PMF, the RACI Matrix outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Project Sponsor and other key executive leaders. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

#### 2.2.2 Roles
The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities for those involved in Leadership Support activities during the Initiating Process Phase.

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **OCM Practitioner** | - Develop the Sponsorship Action Register<br>- Identify and assess leaders as change supporters |
| **Project Sponsor** | - Review and revise the Sponsorship Action Register with the Project Sponsor<br>- Identify and evaluate other key executives<br>- Coach key executives as needed<br>- Provide input and commitment to the Sponsorship Action Register<br>- Provide project support and facilitate necessary approvals |
| **Executive Leadership** | - Provide project support and necessary approvals |

For a complete list of all CA-OCM roles, see the OCM Role Definitions in the Glossary.

#### 22.3 Activities
Strong project leadership is critical at every phase. During the Initiating Process Phase, the Leadership Support Knowledge Area encourages strong project leadership by developing a Sponsorship Action Register to engage the Project Sponsor. Additionally, the OCM Practitioner identifies and encourages other key executives as change supporters.

##### Develop the Sponsorship Action Register
An effective Project Sponsor can legitimize a change initiative by saying, “This is what we are going to do,” thereby shifting the focus from “why” and “what” to “how” and “when.” The Project Sponsor leads the change but does not manage day-to-day activities. To support the Project Sponsor, the Sponsorship Action Register documents responsibilities, time commitments, and schedules. The OCM Practitioner should consider the following questions when developing the register:

- What priority areas and activities will benefit from the Project Sponsor’s involvement?
- What time constraints or competing priorities does the Project Sponsor have?
- What is the Project Sponsor’s estimated time commitment for the change initiative?

The Sponsorship Action Register includes a list of the Sponsor’s required actions, the frequency of these actions, and detailed responsibilities. For example, the OCM Practitioner may coordinate with the Project Manager and Project Sponsor to identify the need for the Sponsor’s attendance at bi-weekly project status meetings. The OCM Practitioner would record this commitment on the Sponsorship Action Register.

##### Identify and Assess Leaders as Change Supporters
A Project Sponsor’s support and engagement are crucial for demonstrating an organization’s commitment to change. Identifying and involving additional key executives early increases the likelihood of project success. Key executives may include department directors, deputy directors, chief administrative officers, chief financial officers, chief information officers, and program leads.

The OCM Practitioner should review the project RACI Matrix to ensure all influential executives are identified. If the list is incomplete, the OCM Practitioner should assist the Project Manager in adding the missing individuals.

Not all identified leaders will support the change. The OCM Practitioner should assess where executives fall on the scale of change support, using the Leadership Support Matrix (Figure 2-5).

**Skills:**
- Coaching
- Facilitation
- Analysis

**Inputs:**
- RACI Matrix

**Outputs:**
- Completed Leadership Support Assessment
- Identified Key Executives

##### Conduct a Leadership Support Assessment
While the goal is to have all key executives support the change, it is more realistic to prioritize efforts. The OCM Practitioner, working with the Project Sponsor as needed, should conduct Leadership Support Assessments. This internal assessment evaluates leaders based on their level of support and influence on the change initiative.

- **Level of Support**: Refers to the desire or lack of desire to support the change. Common reasons for resistance include a lack of understanding or competing priorities.
- **Level of Influence**: Focuses on the leader’s ability to influence change, based on their title or relationships with decision-makers.

**Tools:**
- Leadership Support Assessment Template

**Outputs:**
- Completed Leadership Support Assessment

##### Build Leadership Support for the Change
Once the OCM Practitioner has identified and prioritized executives, they should address the reasons for any lack of support. Leaders who are not supportive may have various reasons, such as:

- The change is not a priority for the leader.
- The leader does not have time to commit to the change.
- The leader feels an alternate solution would better suit the organization.
- The leader does not understand the change.

The OCM Practitioner can define actions to address opposition using coaching, targeted communications, facilitated sessions, or one-on-one conversations. The table below provides sample reasons for resistance and mitigating activities.

| Reason for Lack of Support | Mitigating Activities |
| --- | --- |
| The change is not a priority for the leader | - Schedule one-on-one conversations between the identified leader and the Project Sponsor to impress the need for change, identify competing priorities, and discuss the priority of the effort. |
| The leader does not have time to commit to the change | - Schedule one-on-one conversations between the identified leader and the Project Sponsor to impress the need for change, identify competing priorities, and determine a schedule of project involvement that addresses competing priorities. |
| The leader feels an alternate solution would better suit the organization | - Schedule a facilitated session with the Project Sponsor and executive leaders to discuss the business need and alternate solutions, and to impress the benefits of the chosen initiative. |
| The leader does not understand the change | - Develop targeted communications that detail the business need, change magnitude, expected benefits, and the project schedule. |

### 2.3 Team Dynamics

**Concept:**
- Initiating
- Planning
- Executing
- Closing

**Team Dynamics Efforts:**
Address the project team’s working environment, behaviors, and operating style to facilitate a cohesive, high-performing team. In the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner aids the Project Manager in establishing project team guidelines to lay the foundation for a clear direction and positive working environment. A well-planned and clearly articulated set of guidelines supports productive teamwork. The entire team must embrace these guidelines to strengthen teamwork and improve the likelihood of project success.

In subsequent process phases, Team Dynamics focuses on building and monitoring the team atmosphere.

**Figure 2-7** demonstrates the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs for Team Dynamics in the Initiating Process Phase.
