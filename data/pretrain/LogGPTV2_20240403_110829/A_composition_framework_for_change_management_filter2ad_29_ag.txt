2.2.1 Inputs
In order to complete the Initiating Process Phase Leadership Support activities, 
the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:
Project  Sponsorship  Assessment:  This  assessment,  completed  by  the  OCM 
Practitioner  in  the  Concept  Process  Phase,  provides  guidance  in  identifying  a 
Sponsor’s level of availability, interest, and knowledge of the change initiative.
OCM Schedule: The OCM Schedule is created in the OCM Lifecycle Management 
Knowledge  Area  within  this  process  phase.  It  identifies  the  schedule  of  OCM 
activities, which will be helpful in defining the Sponsor’s role.
RACI Matrix: The RACI Matrix, developed as part of the CA-PMF, provides roles 
and responsibilities of the Project Sponsor and other key executive leaders. RACI 
is an acronym derived from four key responsibilities: Responsible, Accountable, 
Consulted, and Informed.

2.2.3 Activities
Strong project leadership is critical during every process phase. In the Initiating 
Process  Phase,  the  Leadership  Support  Knowledge  Area  encourages  strong 
project leadership by developing a Sponsorship Action Register to engage the 
Project Sponsor. In addition, the OCM Practitioner identifies and encourages 
other key executives as change supporters.

Develop the Sponsorship Action Register
An effective Project Sponsor can help legitimize a change initiative by saying, 
“This is what we are going to do,” essentially stopping the debate on “why” and 
“what,” and shifting the focus of discussion to “how,” and “when.” The Project 
Sponsor typically leads the change in this manner but does not manage the day-
to-day change activities as the project progresses through the project lifecycle. 
To  support  the  Project  Sponsor  in  fulfilling  his  or  her  role,  the  Sponsorship 
Action  Register  will  be  created  to  document  Sponsor  responsibilities,  time 
commitments,  and  schedule.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  consider  the 
following questions when developing the Sponsorship Action Register:
•  What priority areas and activities will benefit from the  
Project Sponsor’s involvement?
•  What time constraints or competing priorities does the  
Project Sponsor have?
•  What is the Project Sponsor’s estimated time commitment  
for the change initiative?
The  Sponsorship  Action  Register  contains  a  list  of  the  Sponsor’s  required 
actions, the frequency of these actions, and the detailed responsibilities of the 
Sponsor. For example, the OCM Practitioner may coordinate with the Project 
Manager and Project Sponsor to identify the need for the Sponsor’s attendance 
at a bi-weekly project status meeting. The OCM Practitioner would record this 
commitment on the Sponsorship Action Register.

Identify and Assess Leaders as Change Supporters 
A  Project  Sponsor’s  support  and  engagement  is  a  significant  part  of 
demonstrating  an  organization’s  commitment  to  change,  and  identifying 
and  involving  additional  key  executives  at  this  early  stage  will  increase  the 
likelihood  of  project  success.  Key  executives  may  include  a  department’s 
director,  deputy  directors,  chief  administrative  officer,  chief  financial  officer, 
chief  information  officer,  and/or  program  leads.  This  is  the  time  to  identify, 
assess, and communicate with key leaders who will play a role in helping the 
project progress forward.
Identify and Assess Leaders
The OCM Practitioner should review the project RACI Matrix to verify that all 
executives with influencing authority over the project have been identified. If the 
OCM Practitioner determines that the list in the RACI Matrix is not complete, the 
OCM Practitioner should assist the Project Manager in adding those individuals 
who have been omitted.
Not all identified leaders will be supporters of the change initiative. As further 
detailed below, the OCM Practitioner should assess where executives identified 
in the RACI matrix fall on the scale of change support, as demonstrated by the 
Leadership Support Matrix shown in Figure 2-5.

•  RACI Matrix
Initiating | Page 21
Executives at the far lef of the horizontal axis are unlikely to push for project 
approval  or  may  create  barriers  to  change.  Executives  may  display  resistant 
behaviors,  ofen  stemming  from  not  understanding  the  need  for  change,  or 
supporting  other  organizational  competing  priorities.  On  the  other  hand, 
executives at the far right of the horizontal axis believe in the change initiative 
and the reasons behind it. They will make the change a priority and may visibly 
show their support and acceptance of the change initiative. 
In addition to level of change support, the OCM Practitioner should also assess  
an executive’s influence to the change initiative, as shown by the vertical axis.  
Executives who are supportive of the change with a low level of influence are a  
low priority for the OCM Practitioner to coach and engage. Executives with high  
influence  who  do  not  support  the  change  are  the  highest  risk,  and  should  be  
a high priority to address. Assessing leaders in this manner will allow the OCM  
Practitioner to focus time and eforts on the highest risk and priority executives. 
Conduct a Leadership Support Assessment 
While the goal is to have all key executives act as supporters of change, it is more 
realistic to say that leaders may fall anywhere on the support scale. In order 
to prioritize eforts, the OCM Practitioner, working with the Project Sponsor as 
needed, should conduct Leadership Support Assessments. This will serve as an 
internal assessment performed by the OCM Practitioner and project team to 
evaluate leaders in two key areas or leadership categories described above – 
their level of support and level of influence on the change initiative. 
A leader’s level of support refers to their desire, or lack of desire, to support a 
change initiative. Executives, as with all Stakeholders, have diferent reasons 
and behaviors used to resist change. The OCM Practitioner must identify drivers 
for resistance in order to address it and gain executive support for the change 
initiative. Common examples of resistance drivers for executives include lack of 
understanding of the change or competing priorities. 
The  second  category  assessed  is  a  leader’s  influence.  Ideally,  the  OCM 
Practitioner, working with the Project Sponsor as needed, should focus eforts 
on the leaders with the greatest ability to influence change, either based on 
their  title  within  the  organization  or  the  relationships  that  they  have  with 
decision makers.

Leadership Support 
Assessment 
Initiating | Page 22 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkInitiatingLeadership SupportWhen the OCM Practitioner assesses both level of support and level of influence, 
he/she can identify an overall priority level for addressing the specific needs of 
the leader through planned OCM activities. The Leadership Support Assessment 
provides relative priority rankings for all leaders assessed and provides guidance 
for the OCM Practitioner to focus the OCM eforts. 
For example, an executive who has a low level of support (scored as 1), and 
a  high  level  of  importance  (scored  as  1),  will  have  a  high  overall  priority  for 
the project. In contrast, a leader who has a low level of resistance (scored as 
5), and a low level of importance (scored as 5), will have a low overall priority 
for the project. This evaluation will assists the OCM Practitioner in identifying 
and prioritizing executives whose engagement and support are necessary for 
ongoing project success. It is important to note that this assessment is meant to 
be an informal working document for the OCM Practitioner and the information 
provided on it should be guarded and shared sparingly. 
Build Leadership Support for the Change 
Once the OCM Practitioner has identified and prioritized executives according 
to their support and influence on the change initiative, the OCM Practitioner 
should  seek  to  identify  why  some  leaders  are  more  willing  to  show  active 
support for the change initiative. Leaders who are not supportive of a change 
efort may be counter to the efort for several reasons, including: 
•   The change is not a priority for the leader 
•   The leader does not have time to commit to the change 
•   The leader feels an alternate solution would better suit the organization 
•   The leader does not understand the change 
Once the OCM Practitioner understands the reasons for an executive’s lack of 
support for the change, the OCM Practitioner can define actions to address the 
opposition using coaching, targeted communications, facilitated sessions, or 
one-on-one conversations that center on the executive, their role in the change 
initiative, and the reason(s) for resistance. The table on the next page provides 
sample reasons for resistance and mitigating activities. It is important to note 
that this is not an exhaustive list and the OCM Practitioner should use his/her 
knowledge of the organization, the project, and the leaders to tailor mitigating 
activities accordingly.

Mitigating Activities 
The OCM Practitioner may schedule one-on-

•   Identify competing priorities 
•   Discuss the priority of the efort in relation 
to competing priorities

The OCM Practitioner may develop targeted 
communications that detail the business need, 
change magnitude, benefits expected, and the 
project schedule 
Initiating | Page 24 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkInitiatingLeadership SupportThese  targeted  communications  will  allow  executives  to  gain  a  better 
understanding of the change and voice their concerns and questions. The OCM 
Practitioner  may  also  work  with  the  Project  Sponsor  to  participate  in  these 
eforts as necessary. 
To help the OCM Practitioner monitor the activities conducted with the Project  
Sponsor  and  executives,  he/she  should  develop  and  maintain  a  Leadership  
Support Action Log. This living document allows the OCM Practitioner to keep  
track of the actions taken with each executive, as well as the responsible resource,  
the timing, and the frequency of such actions. The Leadership Support Action Log  
also allows for an easy transition of responsibility if there is a change in role .

Team  Dynamics  eforts  address  the  project  team’s  working  environment, 
behaviors, and operating style to facilitate a cohesive, high-performing team. In 
the Initiating Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner aids the Project Manager in 
establishing project team guidelines to lay the foundation for a clear direction 
and positive working environment. A well planned and clearly articulated set of 
guidelines support productive teamwork, and the OCM Practitioner should work 
with the project team to ensure these guidelines are a clear part of everyday 
work,  not  just  words  written  and  forgotten.  The  entire  team  must  embrace 
the guidelines in order to strengthen teamwork and improve the likelihood of 
project success. As noted in Figure 2-6, in subsequent process phases, Team 
Dynamics focuses on building and monitoring the team atmosphere. 
Figure 2-7 demonstrates the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs
