ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the causes of packet loss in a 38-node
urban multi-hop 802.11b network. The patterns and causes
of loss are important in the design of routing and error-
correction protocols, as well as in network planning.
The paper makes the following observations. The distri-
bution of inter-node loss rates is relatively uniform over the
whole range of loss rates; there is no clear threshold sepa-
rating “in range” and “out of range.” Most links have rela-
tively stable loss rates from one second to the next, though
a small minority have very bursty losses at that time scale.
Signal-to-noise ratio and distance have little predictive value
for loss rate. The large number of links with intermediate
loss rates is probably due to multi-path fading rather than
attenuation or interference.
The phenomena discussed here are all well-known. The
contributions of this paper are an understanding of their
relative importance, of how they interact, and of the impli-
cations for MAC and routing protocol design.

802.11b cards in apartments spread over six square kilome-
ters of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Each node has a roof-
mounted omni-directional antenna. The network’s main
purpose is to provide Internet access via a few wired gate-
ways. The initial implementation strategy was to combine
existing radio, MAC, and routing technology in order to
build a production-quality network as quickly as possible.
This approach led to performance far less than expected,
primarily due to assumptions made by MAC and routing
protocols that were a poor ﬁt to the network’s actual be-
havior.
It is widely understood that wireless diﬀers from
simple abstract models in a number of ways [10]; the goal
of this paper is to provide insight into which diﬀerences are
important enough to worry about, and to draw conclusions
relevant to the design of future MAC and routing protocols.
Many routing and link-layer protocols assume the validity
of a “neighbor” abstraction that partitions all the pairs of
nodes into pairs that can communicate directly, and pairs
that cannot. This assumption justiﬁes the use of graph-
theoretic routing algorithms borrowed from wired networks,
where the assumption is true. It leads to the design of MAC
protocols such as 802.11 that assume that a pair of nodes will
either hear each other’s control packets (e.g. RTS/CTS),
or will not interfere. It justiﬁes conservative transmit bit-
rate selection algorithms that reduce the bit-rate after a few
packet losses. Many existing protocols might have to be re-
designed if the neighbor abstraction turned out to be a poor
approximation of reality.
In principle the neighbor abstraction is supported by typ-
ical assumptions about the relationship between signal-to-
noise ratio and bit error rate (S/N and BER). This relation-
ship is typically assumed to have a rapid transition from
essentially zero BER to a BER high enough to corrupt ev-
ery packet. For example, the transition zone for the Intersil
Prism HFA3873 baseband processor is about 3 dB, regard-
less of bit rate [1]. Since signal strength falls oﬀ rapidly with
distance, one might expect relatively few node pairs to lie
in the transition zone. As a result, one might expect almost
all pairs of nodes to either be able to talk to each other with
low loss, or not at all. Some empirical 802.11 measurements
suggest that the neighbor abstraction usually holds [7, 10],
while others do not [6, 11].
This paper starts with the observation that most Roofnet
node pairs that can communicate at all have intermediate
loss rates; that is, the neighbor abstraction is a poor approx-
121Links with intermediate loss rates are com-
mon, with no sharp transition between high
and low packet loss rates.
Inter-node distance is not strongly correlated
with whether nodes can communicate.
Most links have non-bursty loss patterns.
Links with very high signal strengths are
likely to have low loss rates, but in general
signal strength has little predictive value.
A link is likely to have a signiﬁcant loss rate
at its optimum 802.11b bit-rate.
Multi-path fading greatly aﬀects outdoor
links and helps explain intermediate loss
rates.

imation of reality. The remainder of the paper explores a
series of hypotheses for the causes of packet loss in Roofnet,
and for the predominance of intermediate loss rates. The
hypotheses include factors that aﬀect signal-to-noise ratio
(distance and interference), choice of transmit bit rate, and
multi-path fading. Figure 1 lists the paper’s main conclu-
sions about these sources of packet loss. The conclusions in
this paper should not be viewed as universal, since they are
limited by the particulars of Roofnet’s conﬁguration.
2. Experimental Methodology
Roofnet consists of 38 nodes distributed over roughly six
square kilometers of Cambridge. Each consists of a PC with
an 802.11b card connected to an omni-directional antenna
mounted on the roof. Figure 2 shows a map of the network.
The area is dominated by tightly-packed three- and four-
story houses; most antennas are mounted about two or three
feet above the chimneys of these houses. There are also a
number of taller buildings in the area; seven Roofnet nodes
are located in such buildings. Not all nodes have roof-

ulator.
mounted antennas: a handful of users found it easier to
place the antenna in or hanging outside of a window.
All nodes use identical 802.11b cards based on the Intersil
Prism 2.5 chip-set. Except as noted, the cards transmit at
2.422 GHz (802.11b channel 3) with the transmission power
level set to +23 dBm (200 mW). The omni-directional an-
tennas provide 8 dBi of gain with a 20-degree -3 dB vertical
beam-width. Cabling and lightning arrestors introduce an
attenuation of 6 to 10 dB depending on the length of cable.
The cards can be conﬁgured to transmit at 1, 2, 5.5, or 11
Mbit/s; the experiments in this paper run with automatic
bit-rate selection disabled. The cards operate in the Prism
2.5 “pseudo-IBSS” mode, which is a simpliﬁed version of
the 802.11b IBSS (ad hoc) mode; use of pseudo-IBSS cir-
cumvents ﬁrmware bugs in the IBSS implementation that
can cause network partition.
Nodes are located at the apartments of volunteers, who
were selected with no special plan beyond basic radio con-
nectivity. The experiments were run with Roofnet routing
turned oﬀ, and thus with no Roofnet user traﬃc. All the
experiments were executed in the early hours of the morn-
ing, so the paper’s results may underestimate the eﬀects of
non-Roofnet radio activity.
Most of the Roofnet data presented in this paper is derived
from a single experiment. In this experiment, each node in
turn sends 1500-byte 802.11 broadcast packets as fast as
it can, while the rest of the nodes passively listen. Each
sender sends for 90 seconds at each of the 802.11b bit-rates.
The experiment uses 802.11 broadcast packets because they
involve no link-level acknowledgments or retransmissions.
Each packet includes a unique sequence number. The
sender records the time at which it sends each packet, and
all the other nodes record each received packet’s sequence
number, arrival time, and the “RSSI” and “silence” values
that the 802.11 card reports.
The experiment was run in the early hours of June 6,
2004. Figure 16 was derived from a similar experiment on
June 1, 2004, in which diﬀerent power levels were tested.
The authors have examined the results from many similar
experiments over a period of months and veriﬁed that they
are similar to the data presented in this paper.
2.1 Channel Emulator
In addition to the Roofnet experiments, this paper presents
results from a wireless channel emulator [8], to which two
sender laptops and a single receiver laptop are connected.

Node Pair
Figure 4: The distribution of link delivery proba-
bilities for 1500-byte broadcast packets. Each point
corresponds to one sender/receiver pair at a partic-
ular bit-rate. Points were restricted to pairs that
managed to deliver at least one packet during the
experiment. Most pairs have intermediate delivery
probabilities.
The laptops use the same wireless cards used by Roofnet.
Figure 3 shows the emulator’s architecture.
The outgoing signal of each source card is ﬁrst attenuated
and then mixed down to baseband where it is digitized and
sent to the digital signal processing (DSP) unit. The DSP
then independently scales the signals from each source to
emulate large scale path loss. A small number of delayed
copies of a signal may also be produced and independently
scaled. All signals are then summed and then converted
back to analog. The resulting baseband signal is then at-
tenuated, mixed up to RF, and fed to the receiver’s 802.11
antenna input. The attenuation and delay used by the DSP
are controlled by the Emulation Control Node which also
controls the transmission of traﬃc by the source nodes.
In the emulator experiments, the receiver node operated in
monitor mode and logged the headers of all frames received.
These logs were then post-processed to generate the results
discussed in this paper.
2.2 Signal Strength Measurements
The Prism 2.5 chip-set provides per-frame measurements
called RSSI (receive signal strength indication) and “silence
value.” The RSSI reﬂects the total power observed by the
radio hardware while receiving the frame, including signal,
interference, and background noise. The silence value re-
ﬂects the total power observed just before the start of the
frame. We found that the accuracy of the RSSI and silence
readings was within 4 dB by comparison with a spectrum
analyzer. This paper reports signal-to-noise ratios derived
from the RSSI and silence values.
3. Distribution of Delivery Probabilities
Figure 4 shows the distribution of inter-node packet de-
livery probabilities on Roofnet at diﬀerent 802.11 transmit
rates. The graph includes only node pairs between which
at least one packet was delivered, and thus reﬂects diﬀerent
numbers of pairs for diﬀerent bit rates. The data for each
bit-rate is sorted separately, so the delivery probabilities for
any particular x-value are not typically from the same pair
of nodes.
At 1, 2, and 5.5 Mbit/s, Figure 4 shows that the distri-
bution of loss rates is fairly uniform: there is only a slight
tendency for pairs to segregate between working and not
working. At 11 Mbit/s, there is a more rapid fall-oﬀ in
delivery probability, but there are still many links with in-
termediate probabilities.
The implication of Figure 4 is that the neighbor abstrac-
tion does not apply well to Roofnet: most node pairs that
can communicate have intermediate loss rates. It would be
diﬃcult to ﬁnd multi-hop routes through Roofnet that did
not involve one or more hops with signiﬁcant loss rates. A
routing protocol cannot ignore this problem by simply ignor-
ing all but the very best links: for example, a one-hop route
with 40% loss rate has better throughput than a two-hop
route with loss-free links [6].
The failure of the neighbor abstraction in some real-world
wireless environments has been noted before and shown to
seriously reduce the performance of multi-hop routing [11, 6,
15]. The failure is perhaps surprising given that some mea-
surements of 802.11 and 802.11-like systems suggest that
nodes that can communicate at all can usually communi-
cate with low loss [7, 10]. The rest of this paper explores
the causes and implications of the prevalence of intermedi-
ate delivery probabilities, focusing on the reasons for packet
loss in Roofnet and the nature of the delivery-probability
distribution in Figure 4.
4. Spatial Distribution of Loss Rates
A potential explanation for the distribution of link de-
livery probabilities in Figure 4 is that it is determined by
attenuation due to distance. Figure 5 shows three samples
of how delivery probability varies with location. Each map
corresponds to a diﬀerent sender; the size of each node’s disk
indicates the fraction of packets that node received from the
sender.
Since the three senders are close to each other, one might
expect the three reception patterns to be similar. This is
true to the extent that very close nodes have high delivery
probabilities for all three senders. Other than that, how-
ever, the three reception patterns are quite diﬀerent. The
diﬀerences are likely caused by obstacles in the environment,
diﬀerent antenna heights, and multi-path fading, implying
that up to a certain point reception is dominated by obsta-
cles and geometry rather than by free space path loss.
Figure 6 shows the relationship between distance and de-
livery probability for all Roofnet node pairs, for 1 and 11
Mbit/s. Both bit-rates exhibit a cluster of short links with
high delivery probabilities, a few remarkably long links, and
a signiﬁcant set of links with no discernible relationship be-
tween distance and delivery probability.
5. Time Variation of Loss Rate
The signiﬁcance of intermediate loss rates depends on the
time scale at which loss and delivery alternate. One way in
which a link might exhibit a 50% loss rate would be to deliver
or drop each packet in alternation. At another extreme, a
50% link might alternate 10-second periods of total loss and
total delivery. Diﬀerent route selection and error correction
strategies are appropriate in the two diﬀerent situations.
