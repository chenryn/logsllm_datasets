ABSTRACT
Defending against denial-of-service (DoS) in a mobile ad
hoc network (MANET) is challenging because the network
topology is dynamic and nodes are selﬁsh. In this paper, we
propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signa-
tures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do
not pass the veriﬁcation. Since nodes are selﬁsh, they may
not perform the veriﬁcation so that they can avoid paying
the overhead. A bad packet that escapes veriﬁcation along
the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its for-
warders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes
along a network path, in optimizing their own beneﬁts, are
encouraged to act collectively to ﬁlter out bad packets. An-
alytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained
for players in the proposed game, in which signiﬁcant ben-
eﬁts can be provided to forwarders such that many of the
bad packets will be eliminated by veriﬁcation.

INTRODUCTION
The dependencies between dynamic, mutually untrusted
neighbors in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) create im-
portant security concerns in such networks. Among the at-
tacks documented in the literature, denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks are particularly damaging since both communica-
tion bandwidth and node resources are scarce in MANETs.
In addition to their ability to take down a network quickly,
DoS attacks directed at bandwidth and end node resources
are easy to launch; e.g., by simply injecting useless traﬃc
into the network.
DoS mitigation techniques designed for wireline networks
will not work well in an ad hoc environment where the routes
and the set of forwarders on a routing path are highly dy-
namic and are selﬁsh. Secure routing protocols designed
for ad hoc networks [3] build secure routes to support end-
to-end communication. If link layer security is applied [4],

these protocols can mitigate DoS attacks. Illegitimate pack-
ets will be discovered as outside attackers do not know the
keys shared between the hops. However, an inside attacker,
i.e., an attacker who is a member of the end-to-end path, can
still launch an attack. Without using signatures, it is diﬃ-
cult to identify the attacker even if the attacker is known to
be an insider. In addition, in networks where packet deliv-
ery is route-based, these secure routing protocols cannot be
applied because the path can change from packet to packet.
Motivating nodes to serve each other is another fundamen-
tal issue in MANETs. Speciﬁcally, as communication end-
points rely on intermediate nodes to forward their traﬃc, in-
centives for the forwarders have to be provided. Traditional
incentive systems have used nuggets [2] and reputation cred-
its [1] to encourage nodes to function as forwarders. The
incentive issue becomes even more relevant in the security
context, when security measures may require certain nodes
to expend more resources to better defend other nodes. The
incentive issue as it relates to the security issue has been
less addressed by the research community.
In this work, we propose a DoS mitigating technique for
MANETs that jointly considers the security and incentive is-
sues. The technique is designed to work in a packet-switching
network environment. The idea is based on an attacker’s
goal to avoid detection and being identiﬁed. Hence, we
protect legitimate packets by requiring them to be signed
by their respective senders. A forwarder veriﬁes a packet’s
sender signature when the packet is received. If the veriﬁca-
tion fails, the packet is dropped. Otherwise, it is forwarded.
We assume that network nodes are selﬁsh but rational.
Incentive for a node to forward packets is given by a re-
ward the node will obtain after the packets are successfully
delivered to their ﬁnal destinations. A forwarder may also
choose to forward a packet without veriﬁcation, since the
operation carries a cost. To motivate a forwarder to verify,
a penalty is assessed for a “lazy” node each time it forwards
an attacker packet that ﬁnally reaches the destination. We
will investigate the properties of the resulting game, as for-
warders independently attempt to play a best forwarding
/ veriﬁcation strategy that will maximize their own payoﬀs,
while the network is subject to given inputs of attacking and
legitimate traﬃc.
We use game theory to study how a system of forwarders
can be motivated to forward good packets while ﬁltering out
bad packets cooperatively by veriﬁcation. We will propose
solutions that address jointly the security and incentive is-
sues. We will discuss how practical cost functions can be
assigned for sending, forwarding, receiving, and verifying
packets.
2. GAME THEORETIC DOS MITIGATION
IN MANET
2.1 Mitigating DoS in MANET
We require that legitimate sources digitally sign their pack-
ets. Other than the network level routing information and
the application level data payload, each packet will also
carry a signed MAC (Message Authentication Code), includ-
ing a certiﬁcate for the originator’s public key. The signed
MAC with the certiﬁcate is used to verify that the packet is
from the claimed legitimate source. If the MAC carried in
the packet does not match the MAC a forwarder generates
from the received packet, the packet is classiﬁed as a bad
packet and therefore dropped.
The signature-based defense is prone to the replay attack.
An attacker can replay a legitimate packet a large number
of times to generate a high load of useless traﬃc. These
packets will pass the veriﬁcation step. To deal with the
replay attack, a packet should be stamped with its genera-
tion time. In addition, each packet has a given lifetime. A
packet whose life time has expired will be dropped. To pre-
vent a malicious node from sending a legitimate packet to
diﬀerent next hops during the packet’s lifetime, a neighbor
monitoring technique can be used. In neighbor monitoring,
a node reads the complete header, including both the MAC
and network level headers, of every packet even if the node
is not the packet’s next hop. The node stores the header
read until the corresponding packet’s lifetime expires. Upon
hearing a packet whose lifetime has not expired, the node
will compare the header read with the headers currently in
the node’s local store. By doing this, the node can detect
a replayed packet and drop it before further damage to the
network happens. Since only the packet header, but not the
whole packet, has to be read, the cost of monitoring will
be kept low. If the packet lifetime is not too long, which is
normally the case in ad hoc networks, a node will not need
to store too many packet headers, which reduces the storage
cost. Note that the monitoring technique will not be eﬀec-
tive in a wireline network if attackers select diﬀerent routes
for sending diﬀerent replayed packets, since one forwarder
will then be unable to monitor packets destined for another
forwarder.
Fig. 1 shows the proposed packet format. In the ﬁgure,
the previous hop is the node forwarding the packet, and
the next hop is the node designated as the receiver of the
forwarded packet.

If every forwarder veriﬁes packets before forwarding them,
any attack traﬃc will be discovered and dropped to limit its
damage to the network. In particular, end servers are ex-
