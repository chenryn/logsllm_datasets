The planned port numbers are as follows: 8080: web service 3306: database service 5672: message queue 6379: cache service 9200: search engine In order to avoid port conflicts as much as possible, it is recommended to record the port plan in a central place. For all relevant personnel to review and maintain. At the same time, regular port scanning and monitoring is also required to detect and solve port conflicts or abnormal problems in time.
