is Windows Explorer. This option is referred 
to as safe mode with command prompt in 
the alternate boot menu.
sos
Boolean
SOS
Causes Windows to list the device drivers 
marked to load at boot time and then to 
display the system version number (includ-
ing the build number), amount of physical 
memory, and number of processors.
systemroot
String
SYSTEM_ROOT
Specifies the path, relative to osdevice, in 
which the operating system is installed.
targetname
Name
KERNEL_DEBUGGER
_USB_TARGETNAME
For USB debugging, assigns a name to the 
machine that is being debugged.
tpmbootentropy
Default, ForceDisable, 
ForceEnable
TPM_BOOT_ENTROPY
_POLICY
Forces a specific TPM Boot Entropy policy to 
be selected by the boot loader and passed 
on to the kernel. TPM Boot Entropy, when 
used, seeds the kernel’s random number 
generator (RNG) with data obtained from 
the TPM (if present).
usefirmwarepcisettings
Boolean
USE_FIRMWARE_PCI
_SETTINGS
Stops Windows from dynamically assigning 
IO/IRQ resources to PCI devices and leaves 
the devices configured by the BIOS. See 
Microsoft Knowledge Base article 148501 for 
more information.
uselegacyapicmode
Boolean
USE_LEGACY_APIC
_MODE
Forces usage of basic APIC functionality 
even though the chipset reports extended 
APIC functionality as present. Used in cases 
of hardware errata and/or incompatibility.
usephysicaldestination
Boolean
USE_PHYSICAL_
DESTINATION,
Forces the use of the APIC in physical desti-
nation mode.
useplatformclock
Boolean
USE_PLATFORM_CLOCK
Forces usage of the platforms’s clock source 
as the system’s performance counter.
vga
Boolean
USE_VGA_DRIVER
Forces Windows to use the VGA display 
driver instead of the third-party high-per-
formance driver.
winpe
Boolean
WINPE
Used by Windows PE, this option causes the 
configuration manager to load the registry 
SYSTEM hive as a volatile hive such that 
changes made to it in memory are not saved 
back to the hive image.
x2apicpolicy
Disabled, Enabled, 
Default
X2APIC_POLICY
Specifies whether extended APIC func-
tionality should be used if the chipset sup-
ports it. Disabled is equivalent to setting 
uselegacyapicmode, whereas Enabled forces 
ACPI functionality on even if errata are de-
tected. Default uses the chipset’s reported 
capabilities (unless errata are present).
xsavepolicy
Integer
XSAVEPOLICY
Forces the given XSAVE policy to be loaded 
from the XSAVE Policy Resource Driver 
(Hwpolicy.sys).

BCD Element
Values
BCD Element Code3
Meaning
xsaveaddfeature0-7
Integer
XSAVEADDFEATURE0-7
Used while testing support for XSAVE on 
modern Intel processors; allows for faking 
that certain processor features are pres-
ent when, in fact, they are not. This helps 
increase the size of the CONTEXT structure 
and confirms that applications work correct-
ly with extended features that might appear 
in the future. No actual extra functionality 
will be present, however.
xsaveremovefeature
Integer
XSAVEREMOVEFEATURE
Forces the entered XSAVE feature not to 
be reported to the kernel, even though the 
processor supports it.
xsaveprocessorsmask
Integer
XSAVEPROCESSORSMASK
Bitmask of which processors the XSAVE 
policy should apply to.
xsavedisable
Boolean
XSAVEDISABLE
Turns off support for the XSAVE functionality 
even though the processor supports it.
