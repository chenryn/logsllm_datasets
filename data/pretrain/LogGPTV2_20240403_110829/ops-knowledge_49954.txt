Question: A company is planning to develop a mobile application that needs to support both Android and iOS platforms. They want to optimize the development process by minimizing the cost and complexity of maintaining the app. What would be a key advantage of using a cross-platform development framework over maintaining separate native codebases for each platform?
"A": "Cross-platform frameworks allow developers to maintain separate codebases more efficiently than native development.",
"B": "Cross-platform frameworks provide better access to lower-level APIs and device capabilities exclusively.",
"C": "Using cross-platform frameworks enables a single codebase to be compiled for both Android and iOS, reducing maintenance efforts.",
"D": "Cross-platform development tools eliminate the need for any code, as they automatically generate all necessary app components."
Answer: C
