`io::Error` can't implement `Clone` right now because it uses a trait object
internally for custom errors. With #24133 adding the `Sync` bound, it becomes
possible to put `io::Error` in `Arc`. But it would still be nice to be able to
`Clone` it again, which could be accomplished by changing the private
`Box` field to `Arc` instead.
