Figure 3: Clustering of 1,341 nodes representing 481 domains (ovals), 684 bank accounts (triangles), and 176 phone numbers (small
rectangles). Links connect nodes found in the same incident. We obtain 105 clusters containing more than one node, and 26 singletons
(omitted from the ﬁgure). Additional grouping by malware used allows to link six of these clusters (represented by thick dashed
lines), and additional grouping by strong similarities in WHOIS registrant information allows to group another set of seven clusters
(represented by thick dotted lines).
20are ordered in separate boxes in the ﬁgure. The presence of large
connected subgraphs (e.g., top right) indicates that some miscre-
ants are operating a large number of sites, and are reusing phone
numbers or bank accounts across several sites.
While it could, in theory, be possible that two completely dif-
ferent criminals share an identical bank account number, we reject
this hypothesis, as the bank account numbers used have to be valid
for the criminals to collect their dues. Hence, a shared bank ac-
count number means that, at the very least, the miscreants sharing
the account are in a tight business relationship, and probably are the
same individual or group of individuals. Likewise, because phone
numbers used in these frauds are genuine, reusing the same phone
number across several frauds indicates a business relationship be-
tween the perpetrators.
Malware. We further noticed that websites from the second largest
connected subgraph were still alive as of Nov. 2009, indicating
that the fraud continues unabated. As mentioned earlier, we down-
loaded the entire contents of each fraudulent website listed in our
database. We found that a small number (14) of One Click Fraud
websites contained some malware.
Speciﬁcally, some of these sites contain a virus named Trojan.
HachiLem. This is an MS Windows executable ﬁle which is
posted on these sites as a “mandatory video viewer plug-in.” Once
downloaded and executed, this virus automatically collects email
addresses and contacts stored within Outlook Express or Becky!
(email application popular with Japanese enterprise users), and sends
the collected information to a central hachimitsu-lemon.com
server and, possibly, to another machine as well. The collected
email information is in turn used to blackmail victims and notify
them they owe the website registration fees. Interestingly enough
hachimitsu-lemon.com has not been a valid domain name
since, at least, early October 2009, but a report about this virus was
posted as recently as Oct. 26th, 2009 on Wan-Cli Zukan, indicating
that this virus is still mildly active.
Another group of sites contains a simpler, less intrusive form of
malware, which modiﬁes the Windows registry entries to display a
pop up window reminding of the registration fee due upon boot-up.
Additional clustering. An interesting feature of the sites hosting the
Trojan.HachiLem malware is that they all share strong simi-
larities in their WHOIS records. For instance, the technical contact
phone number ﬁeld contains is identical (+81-6-6241-6585). While
it is likely a bogus number, this similarity, coupled with the pres-
ence of identical malware and overall similar appearance of the dif-
ferent websites involved strongly suggest all sites are operated by
the same group. We can thus relate six connected subgraphs to each
other, represented by the dashed boxes in Fig. 3.
We further look into WHOIS information details, and notice that
a number of registrant entries shared similarities across seemingly
different incidents. For example, we found a number of entries
with identical (bogus) contact name, email information, or techni-
cal contact phone number. By grouping this entries together, we
can link seven connected subgraphs, represented by the thick dot-
ted boxes in Fig. 3, to each other.
Fraud distribution. With the assumption that each connected sub-
graph denotes a unique criminal organization, we plot, in Fig. 4, (a)
the number of frauds perpetrated by each group, and (b) the cumu-
lative number of frauds perpetrated by the most active fraudsters.
In Fig. 4(a), we rank criminals by the number of frauds they have
been committing, and plot the number of One Click Frauds perpe-
trated by each group as a function of its rank. We provide data for
both simple clustering (based only on phone numbers, domains,
and bank accounts), as well as additional clustering (further group-
ing criminals by malware used, and identical WHOIS records). We
note that the distribution seems to be following a Zipf law. Specif-
ically, the curve representing a basic clustering ﬁts very well with
the function y = 56/x0.76; and y = 80/x0.90 is a good ﬁt for
the curve obtained by considering additional clustering. The match
with a power law indicates both high concentration (a few people
are responsible for most of the frauds), and long tail behavior (many
people participate in these scams).
Fig. 4(b) plots the same data as Fig. 4(a), but in a cumulative
fashion. What we observe here, is that even with our conserva-
tive clustering strategy, the top 13 miscreant groups are responsible
more than 50% of the fraud. Taking into account similarities exhib-
ited by WHOIS records, and malware deployment, we observe that
the top 8 groups are responsible for more than half of the frauds we
have collected. At the same time, there is a large number of groups
that do not seem to be involved in more than at most a couple of
frauds. Including singletons, 80 out of the 112 groups we extracted
using additional clustering, or about 71% of the criminals involved,
appear to operate at most two sites. This number may be an over-
estimate, since we do not claim that we managed to establish all
possible links that exist. Yet, it tends to indicate that the miscreant
population is a mix of large operators, and of “artisans” running
much more limited criminal enterprises.

Table 4: Presence of One Click Fraud domains in various
blacklists.
Next, we try to see if domains engaging in One Click Fraud are
also supporting other illicit activities. Out of 1608 URLs present
in our database, we extract 842 domain names. These domains
resolve to 275 unique IP addresses.3
We check the 275 IP addresses against a set of eight blacklisting
services that ﬂag IP addresses known for producing large amounts
of spam, and/or trojans and malware, and present our results in
Table 4. While some of the domains are also used for spam, the
vast majority does not appear in any database.
In fact, most of
the hits we see (in L2.apews.org) are coming from sites that
resolve to a parked domain IP address. That is, these sites are not
3A large number of domains, particularly those reported in 2006–
2007, are down, and do not resolve to any IP address anymore.

active as One Click Frauds anymore, and have been reclaimed by
the DNS reseller, which apparently either serves as a spam relay
or has been known to be friendly to spammers. Given the results
we found earlier about the concentration of frauds in some speciﬁc
resellers, this outcome is not particularly surprising.
We further verify this hypothesis by checking our entries against
the Google Safe Browsing database for phishing and malware dis-
tributed as part of Firefox 3, updated as of July 24, 2010. None
of the URLs we ﬁnd in our database is listed in the Google Safe
Browsing database.
However, we also want to check IP addresses of the servers that
host One Click Frauds against the IP addresses of the servers host-
ing pages listed in the Google Safe Browsing database. Recent
versions of the database, such as that used in Firefox 3, only con-
tain hashes of the blacklisted domains rather than the actual domain
information, which makes it impractical to obtain IP addresses as-
sociated with the blacklisted domains. We thus turn to an older
version of the Google Safe Browsing database (bundled with Fire-
fox 2, last updated on June 29, 2008), which contains the black-
listed domains in plaintext.4 In this older database too, none of the
URLs match blacklist entries, but, when comparing IP addresses
of the servers that host One Click Frauds to the IP addresses of
the servers in the blacklist, we see a signiﬁcant (16%) number of
hits. This conﬁrms our ﬁnding that, while the websites engaging in
One Click Frauds keep a relatively low proﬁle, they are sometimes
hosted on very questionable servers, which essentially turn a blind
eye to what their customers are doing.
A possible reason for the relatively lack of conclusive evidence
that One Click Frauds sites engage in other forms of online crime
will become clear in the next section, when we look at the potential
proﬁts miscreants can make. Operating a set of One Click Fraud
sites is indeed quite a proﬁtable endeavor, and we conjecture that,
engaging in other forms of fraud would only have a marginal ben-
eﬁt to the fraudster, while increasing the risk of getting caught.
5. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES
We next turn to looking into the proﬁtability of One Click Frauds.
We start by drafting a very simple economic model, before popu-
lating it with the measurements we obtained from our study. The
objective is not to obtain very precise estimates of the actual proﬁts
that can be made, but mostly to dimension the incentives (or dis-
incentives) to engage in One Click Frauds. We ﬁrst determine the
4Note that, while this blacklist is considerably older than the newer
versions, it is contemporary with a large number of One Click
Frauds we collected.
break-even point in the absence of potential risks for miscreants,
before looking at the impact of penalties (prison, ﬁnes) on crimi-
nals’ incentives. All the numbers in this section are current as of
November 2009.
5.1 Cost-beneﬁt analysis
Costs. A miscreant interested in setting up a One Click Fraud will
need a computer and Internet access. We call this startup cost,
Cinit. Cinit is independent of the number of frauds carried out, but
is actually dependent on time, as Internet access is usually provided
as a monthly subscription service. Then, the miscreant will need to
purchase a DNS name, possibly joint with a web hosting service.
We will call this cost Chost. This cost, too, is time-dependent.
The website has then to be populated with contents (e.g., porno-
graphic images, dating databases), which will cost Ccont. Ccont
can be a ﬁxed price, or a periodic fee, depending on whether the
miscreant is purchasing items in bulk, or as part of a syndicated
service.
The criminal has to set up a bank account, which should not be
traceable back to its real identity. We will assume the cost of this
operation to be Cbank. This is a ﬁxed fee. Likewise, an untraceable
phone number for call-back from the victim may be purchased to
make the fraud more successful. We will denote the cost associated
with this purchase Cphone. This fee is likely to be time-dependent;
for example, the forwarding service discussed in Section 4 is a
monthly subscription.
Proﬁts. Proﬁts primarily come from money obtained through user
payment Puser, conditioned by the number of users n paying the
requested amount f for each incident. The number of users in-
creases with time. Secondary proﬁts, Presale, may be reaped from
reselling databases of victims contact information to other miscre-
ants.
Utility. As we have discussed before, miscreants may actually set
up several frauds, potentially reusing phone numbers and bank ac-
counts across them. Let us denote by S, K, and B the number of
frauds set up, phone numbers, and bank accounts purchased by a
miscreant, respectively. We assume that identical contents is reused
across all frauds operated by the same miscreant, which, based on
casual observation, appears to be the case. We further assume that
hosting costs are directly proportional to the number of sites op-
erated, which is a very conservative assumption, as resellers tend
to provide discounts based on the number of domains purchased.
We also assume that the costs of phone and banking services are
directly proportional to the number of phone lines and banking ac-
