## Abstract

The transition from single-user devices to the Internet of Things (IoT) introduces a new paradigm where multiple users with complex social relationships interact with a single device. Current techniques for access control and authentication in such settings are often inadequate. In this paper, we propose a reenvisioning of access control and authentication for home IoT, focusing on capabilities (i.e., specific actions that devices can perform) rather than on a per-device basis. Through a 425-participant online user study, we find significant differences in desired access-control policies for different capabilities within a single device and based on the user attempting to use that capability. We identify potential default policies and necessary primitives for specifying more complex, yet desired, access-control policies. These primitives include time of day and user location. Finally, we discuss the extent to which various authentication methods support desired policies.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, the proliferation of IoT devices in homes has introduced new security and privacy challenges. Devices like Samsung SmartThings, Amazon Echo, Nest Thermostat, Belkin’s Wemo, and Philips Hue lights have become commonplace. While research has focused on insecure software practices, improper information flows, and patching difficulties, little attention has been paid to access control and authentication in the home IoT.

Traditional devices, such as computers and smartphones, are typically used by a single person, making further access control minimal after initial authentication. However, home IoT devices are shared among multiple users, complicating access control and authentication. For example, a household's shared voice assistant or internet-connected door lock may be accessed by numerous individuals, including children, parents, and temporary workers. These users often have complex social relationships, leading to unique threat models, such as mischievous children, curious parents, and abusive partners.

Moreover, many IoT devices lack screens and keyboards, making traditional authentication methods impractical. Real-world examples, such as TV commercials triggering voice assistants, highlight the need for better access control and authentication.

In this paper, we take a first step towards rethinking access control and authentication for the home IoT. We structure our investigation around four research questions, which we examine in a 425-participant user study. These questions are motivated by the observation that many home IoT devices combine varied functionality in a single device, necessitating a capability-centric model rather than a device-centric one.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Threat Model

Adversaries in the smart home include external third parties and insiders with legitimate physical access. External threats exploit software vulnerabilities, while insider threats, such as temporary workers or children, may subvert access controls for various reasons, including curiosity or willful disobedience. We aim for access-control rules that balance security, privacy, and functionality.

### 2.2 Affordances of Current Devices

Current home IoT devices offer limited access control and authentication. Many devices are controlled via smartphone apps, which provide basic access-control settings. For example, the Nest Thermostat offers a binary model, while the August Smart Lock provides guest and owner levels. Some devices, like the Kwikset Kevo Smart Lock, allow time-based access control. However, these mechanisms are rudimentary and lack the necessary vocabulary for specifying access-control rules in complex, multi-user environments.

Current authentication methods, such as passwords and voice recognition, are transplanted from smartphone and desktop paradigms and are not well-suited for the home IoT. For instance, Google Home uses speaker recognition for personalization but not for security.

## 3. Related Work

Research has focused on analyzing and fixing the security of platforms, protocols, and devices. Studies have highlighted overprivileged smart-home apps and attacks exploiting access-control deficiencies. However, relatively little work has focused on authorizing and authenticating humans to home IoT devices. Prior work has examined the difficulties of access control in the home, but the consumer device landscape has changed rapidly since these initial studies.

## 4. Research Questions

Our investigation is structured around four research questions:

1. **RQ1:** Do desired access-control policies differ among capabilities of single home IoT devices?
2. **RQ2:** For which pairs of relationships and capabilities are desired access-control policies consistent across participants? These can be default settings.
3. **RQ3:** On what contextual factors do access-control policies depend?
4. **RQ4:** What types of authentication methods balance convenience and security, holding the potential to successfully balance the consequences of falsely allowing and denying access?

## 5. Methodology

We conducted a 425-participant online user study to investigate these research questions. Participants specified their desired access-control policies for 22 home IoT capabilities, considering six different relationships (e.g., spouse, child, babysitter). We analyzed the data to identify patterns and preferences.

## 6. Results and Discussion

### 6.1 RQ1: Differences in Desired Access-Control Policies

Participants' desired access-control policies varied significantly among different capabilities within a single device. For example, policies for voice assistants and doors elicited strikingly different responses.

### 6.2 RQ2: Consistent Access-Control Policies

Nearly all participants wanted their spouses to have full access to most capabilities, except for log deletion. Participants also preferred others to control lights and thermostats while at home.

### 6.3 RQ3: Contextual Factors

Contextual factors, such as a user's location, age, and the location of the device, were important in determining access-control policies. Most current devices do not support these contextual factors.

### 6.4 RQ4: Authentication Methods

We identified a spectrum of authentication methods that balance convenience and security. These methods include biometrics, behavioral analysis, and context-aware authentication.

## 7. Contributions

- **Proposing a Capability-Centric Model:** We propose an access-control specification for the multi-user home IoT based on capabilities, which better fits users' expectations than current approaches.
- **Context-Dependent Policies:** We show the frequent context-dependence of access-control policies and identify numerous contextual factors that future interfaces should support.
- **Authentication Agenda:** We set an agenda for authentication in the home IoT based on methods that minimize the consequences of falsely allowing or denying access.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper takes a first step towards rethinking access control and authentication for the home IoT. By focusing on capabilities and contextual factors, we aim to develop more effective and user-friendly access-control and authentication mechanisms. Future work will involve implementing and testing these proposed solutions in real-world settings.
