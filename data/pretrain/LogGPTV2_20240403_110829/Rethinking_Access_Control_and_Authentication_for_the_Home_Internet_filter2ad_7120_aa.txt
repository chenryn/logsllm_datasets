Abstract
Computing is transitioning from single-user devices to
the Internet of Things (IoT), in which multiple users
with complex social relationships interact with a single
device. Currently deployed techniques fail to provide
usable access-control speciﬁcation or authentication in
such settings. In this paper, we begin reenvisioning ac-
cess control and authentication for the home IoT. We pro-
pose that access control focus on IoT capabilities (i. e.,
certain actions that devices can perform), rather than on
a per-device granularity. In a 425-participant online user
study, we ﬁnd stark differences in participants’ desired
access-control policies for different capabilities within a
single device, as well as based on who is trying to use
that capability. From these desired policies, we identify
likely candidates for default policies. We also pinpoint
necessary primitives for specifying more complex, yet
desired, access-control policies. These primitives range
from the time of day to the current location of users. Fi-
nally, we discuss the degree to which different authenti-
cation methods potentially support desired policies.

Introduction
Recent years have seen a proliferation of Internet of
Things (IoT) devices intended for consumers’ homes, in-
cluding Samsung SmartThings [35], the Amazon Echo
voice assistant [2], the Nest Thermostat [48], Belkin’s
Wemo devices [5], and Philips Hue lights [32]. To date,
IoT security and privacy research has focused on such de-
vices’ insecure software-engineering practices [3,13,15],
improper information ﬂows [15,40,45], and the inherent
difﬁculties of patching networked devices [49, 51].
Surprisingly little attention has been paid to access-
control-policy speciﬁcation (expressing which particular
users, in which contexts, are permitted to access a re-
source) or authentication (verifying that users are who
they claim to be) in the home IoT. This state of af-
fairs is troubling because the characteristics that make
the IoT distinct from prior computing domains neces-
sitate a rethinking of access control and authentication.
Traditional devices like computers, phones, tablets, and
smart watches are generally used by only a single per-
son. Therefore, once a user authenticates to their own
device, minimal further access control is needed. These
devices have screens and keyboards, so the process of au-
thentication often involves passwords, PINs, ﬁngerprint
biometrics, or similar approaches [6].
Home IoT devices are fundamentally different. First,
numerous users interact with a single home IoT de-
vice, such as a household’s shared voice assistant or
Internet-connected door lock. Widely deployed tech-
niques for specifying access-control policies and authen-
ticating users fall short when multiple users share a de-
vice [50]. Complicating matters, users in a household
often have complex social relationships with each other,
changing the threat model. For example, mischievous
children [38], parents curious about what their teenagers
are doing [44], and abusive romantic partners [29] are all
localized threats ampliﬁed in home IoT environments.
Furthermore, few IoT devices have screens or key-
boards [37], so users cannot just type a password. While
users could possibly use their phone as a central authen-
tication mechanism, this would lose IoT devices’ hands-
free convenience, while na¨ıve solutions like speaking a
password to a voice assistant are often insecure.
Real-world examples of the shortcomings of current
access-control-policy speciﬁcation and authentication
for home IoT devices have begun to appear. A Burger
King TV commercial triggered Google Home voice as-
sistants to read Wikipedia pages about the Whopper [47],
while the cartoon South Park mischievously triggered
Amazon Echo voice assistants to ﬁll viewers’ Amazon
shopping carts with risqu´e items [34]. While these ex-
amples were relatively harmless, one could imagine a
rogue child remotely controlling the devices in a sibling’s
room to annoy them, a curious babysitter with temporary

access to a home perusing a device’s history of interac-
tions, or an enterprising burglar asking a voice assistant
through a cracked window to unlock the front door [42].
In this paper, we take a ﬁrst step toward rethinking
the speciﬁcation of access-control policies and authenti-
cation for the home IoT. We structure our investigation
around four research questions, which we examine in
a 425-participant user study. These research questions
are motivated by our observation that many home IoT
devices combine varied functionality in a single device.
For example, a home hub or a voice assistant can perform
tasks ranging from turning on the lights to controlling the
door locks. Current access control and authentication is
often based on a device-centric model where access is
granted or denied per device. We move to a capability-
centric model, where we deﬁne a capability as a partic-
ular action (e. g., ordering an item online) that can be
performed on a particular device (e. g., a voice assistant).
Intuition suggests that different capabilities have differ-
ent sensitivities, leading to our ﬁrst research question:
RQ1: Do desired access-control policies differ
among capabilities of single home IoT devices?
(Section 6.2 and 6.3).
We investigated this question by having each study par-
ticipant specify their desired access-control policy for
one of 22 home IoT capabilities we identiﬁed. For house-
hold members of six different relationships (e. g., spouse,
child, babysitter), the participant speciﬁed when that per-
son should be allowed to use that capability. Our ﬁndings
validated our intuition that policies about capabilities,
rather than devices, better capture users’ preferences.
Different capabilities for voice assistants and doors par-
ticularly elicited strikingly different policies.
While the ability to specify granularly who should be
able to use which capabilities is necessary to capture
users’ policies, it incurs a steep usability cost. To mini-
mize this burden through default policies, we asked:
RQ2: For which pairs of relationships (e. g., child)
and capabilities (e. g., turn on lights) are desired
access-control policies consistent across partici-
pants? These can be default settings (Section 6.4).
In our study, nearly all participants always wanted their
spouses to be able to use capabilities other than log dele-
tion at all times. Participants also wanted others to be
able to control the lights and thermostat while at home.
As intimated by the prior policy, the context in which
a particular individual would use a capability may also
matter. Children might be permitted to control lights,
but perhaps not to turn the lights on and off hundreds
of times in succession as children are wont to do. Nor
should children be permitted to operate most household
devices when they are away from home, particularly de-
vices in siblings’ rooms. A babysitter unlocking the door
from inside the house has far fewer security implications
than the babysitter setting a persistent rule to unlock the
front door whenever anyone rings the doorbell.
RQ3: On what contextual factors (e. g., location)
do access-control policies depend? (Section 6.5).
In addition to a user’s location, we found that partici-
pants wanted to specify access-control policies based on
a user’s age, the location of a device, and other factors.
Almost none of these contextual factors are supported
by current devices. Finally, to identify promising di-
rections for designing authentication mechanisms in the
home IoT, we asked:
RQ4: What types of authentication methods bal-
ance convenience and security, holding the potential
to successfully balance the consequences of falsely
allowing and denying access? (Section 6.6).
Analyzing consequences participants noted for falsely al-
lowing or denying access to capabilities, we identify a
spectrum of methods that seem promising for authenti-
cating users (Section 7), thereby enabling enforcement of
users’ desired access-control policies for the home IoT.
Contributions We begin to reenvision access control
and authentication for the home IoT through a 425-
participant user study. Our contributions include:
speciﬁcation for
(i) Proposing access-control
the
multi-user home IoT based on capabilities that bet-
ter ﬁts users’ expectations than current approaches.
(ii) Showing the frequent context-dependence of
access-control policies, identifying numerous con-
textual factors that future interfaces should support.
(iii) Setting an agenda for authentication in the home
IoT based on methods that minimize the conse-
quences of falsely allowing or denying access.
2 Background
In this section, we scope our notion of home IoT de-
vices, identify our threat model, and review current de-
vices’ support for access control and authentication. We
deﬁne home IoT devices to be small appliances that
are Internet-connected and used primarily in the home.
Internet-connected lights and thermostats are two exam-
ples. Many such devices are managed through a hub
that facilitates communication between devices, enforces
policies, and often allows for the creation of end-user
programs or the use of apps.
2.1 Threat Model
The two major classes of adversaries in the smart home
are external third parties and those who have legiti-
mate physical access to the home. The former class
includes those who exploit software vulnerabilities in
256    27th USENIX Security Symposium

platforms [13], devices [3] (e. g., with Mirai), or pro-
tocols [16] intending to cause physical, ﬁnancial, or
privacy-related damage. The latter class includes house-
hold members with legitimate digital or physical access
to the home, such as temporary workers or children [38].
These insider threats have received far less research at-
tention, but are the focus of this paper. Insiders might be
motivated to subvert a smart-home system’s access con-
trols for reasons ranging from curiosity to willful disobe-
dience (e.g., a child attempting to take actions forbidden
by their parents), or to attempt to correct imbalances cre-
ated by the introduction of devices whose surveillance
implications grant asymmetric power to certain members
of a household (e. g., a parent tracking a teenager [44]).
We assume a domestic setting where occupants control
home IoT devices through smartphones, voice assistants,
rules, and physical interaction. For example, a mainte-
nance worker may unlock the front door using a smart-
phone app, while a child might turn off their lights by
speaking to a voice assistant. We aim for access-control
rules that balance security, privacy, and functionality.
2.2 Affordances of Current Devices
Current home IoT devices have relatively limited affor-
dances for access control and authentication. Taking a
ﬁve-year-old survey of the home IoT landscape as a start-
ing point [43], we surveyed current devices’ affordances;
Figure 1 shows representative samples. To control many
current devices, people use smartphone apps that must
be paired with devices. These apps offer various access-
control settings. For example, the Nest Thermostat sup-
ports a binary model where additional users either have
full or no access to all of the thermostat’s capabilities.
The August Smart Lock offers a similar model with guest
and owner levels. Withings wireless scales let users cre-
ate separate accounts and thus isolate their weight mea-
surements from other users. On Apple HomeKit, one can
invite additional users, restricting them to: (a) full con-
trol, (b) view-only control, (c) local or remote control.
Some devices offer slightly richer access-control-
policy speciﬁcation. The Kwikset Kevo Smart Lock al-
lows access-control rules to be time-based; an owner can
grant access to a secondary user for a limited amount
of time. We ﬁnd in our user study that time is a desir-
able contextual factor, but one of only many. We focus
on capabilities, rather than devices. While most current
devices do not allow for access-control policies that dis-
tinguish by capability, Samsung SmartThings lets users
restrict third-party apps from accessing certain capabil-
ities [36]. We ﬁnd that restricting users, not just apps,
access to a particular capability is necessary.
From this analysis, we found current mechanisms to
be rudimentary and lack the necessary vocabulary for
specifying access-control rules in complex, multi-user
environments. We aim to establish a richer vocabulary.
Current authentication methods for the home IoT
appear
transplanted from smartphone and desktop
paradigms. Passwords are widely used in conjunction
with smartphones. For example, SmartThings has an app
through which a user can control devices. A user ﬁrst
authenticates to this app using a password. Voice-based
authentication is currently very rudimentary and is not
used for security, but for personalization. For instance,
Google Home uses speaker recognition for customizing
reminders, but not for security-related tasks [19].
3 Related Work
Current research focuses on analyzing and ﬁxing the se-
curity of platforms [13, 14, 45], protocols [16], and de-
vices [3]. Fernandes et al. discuss how smart-home
apps can be overprivileged in terms of their access to de-
vices and present attacks exploiting deﬁciencies in apps’
access-control mechanisms [13]. Mitigations have in-
volved rethinking permission granting [13, 22, 41].
Comparatively little work has focused on authorizing
and authenticating humans to home IoT devices. Prior
work has focused on the difﬁculties of access control
in the home [4, 24, 25, 30], rather than solutions. Fur-
thermore, the consumer device landscape has changed
rapidly in the years since these initial studies.
Some older work has examined authentication [39]
and access-control [43] for deployed home IoT devices,
