control messages – especially the triggers – need not be too large,
we believe that even this low bandwidth will be sufﬁcient in most
scenarios. To offset the low transmission rate, the messages can
still be transmitted over large time spans, such as over an entire
TV program or multiple occurrences of the same program. One
possibility to improve the bandwidth is to employ multiple channels
simultaneously. For example, the messages may be delivered in
parallel over the audio channel as well a light channel, say while
watching a TV. We believe the bandwidth limit to be inherent in the
design of the sensing-enabled channels. This represents the obvious
trade-off in using these channels for undetectable command and
control when compared to other wired/wireless channels.
6.2 Possible Defense Mechanisms
Although it may be difﬁcult to detect and prevent the out-of-band
command and control presented in this paper, we recognize this to
be an important problem worthy of further investigation. To this
end, we suggest a few preliminary set of defenses.
An intrusion detection application running on the mobile phone
itself can detect the sensor based signaling and prevent the malware
application from receiving it by monitoring the sensor data stream.
To this end, we envision two approaches. First, instead of giving the
applications direct access to the sensors, a virtualization layer can be
created between the sensors and the applications. The virtualization
layer includes a monitor that constantly analyzes the sensor accesses
by different applications as well as the sensor data streams to de-
termine whether any malicious activity is taking place. The virtual
sensor monitor may use machine learning techniques to determine
the natural behavior of benign applications when run by a given user.
The downside of this approach is that it may be rather heavyweight
and requires the phone to monitor a large number of sensor readings.
Second, in order to determine whether a malicious signal is present
in the sensor readings, the phone can take random sensors samples
and analyze them.
4” 2” 3” 3” 4.5” 5” X Y Z 2” 0.5” 1” 0.5” 3” 3.5” X Y Z 3” 1” 3” 3” 4.5” 5” X Y Z 2” 0.25” 1” 0.25” 3” 3.5” X Y Z 478Another phone based defense could be based on the level of power
consumed by applications that access sensors. A malicious applica-
tion listening on to one or more of the sensors is likely to consume
slightly more power compared to other applications (see Table 5).
The feasibility of such a defense against malware is demonstrated
in [23]. A related approach using memory footprints [21] can also
be used to detect such stealthy mobile malware applications.
Finally, another line of defense is to monitor external media
streams for malicious communication. For example, media streams
such as radio, music, or video streams can be monitored by service
providers prior to the transmission. These mechanisms can be
effective against some of the attack scenarios presented in this work
such as the use of TV or radio programs. However, it may be very
difﬁcult to detect the presence of our steganographic channels.
7. RELATED WORK
Most closely related to our work is the Bluetooth based command
and control architecture proposed in [46]. In this approach, Blue-
tooth is used as the primary means of communication between the
botmaster and infected devices. In particular, a hybrid approach
is suggested whereby a set of seed nodes are ﬁrst selected with
which the botmaster communicates over the traditional network
(such as SMS), and these seed nodes then relay the messages to
other nodes in close physical proximity over Bluetooth. Based on
public Bluetooth traces, [46] demonstrated that such an infrastruc-
ture of command and control is feasible. However, it exhibits high
latencies in propagating messages. More speciﬁcally, such messages
can reach about 70% of infected devices within 24 hours. Although
some of our channels also exhibit similar latencies, many other chan-
nels offer an almost real-time delivery guarantees to an extremely
large number of devices. Moreover, many of our channels do not at
all rely upon a traditional infrastructure (such as SMS) and provide
a means of undetectable communication, and some (such as audio)
even possess communication range higher than that of Bluetooth.
HumaNet [8] is a similar architecture to that proposed in [46].
In contrast to [46], however, in this approach, the command and
control messages are delivered only via phone to phone ad hoc
communication (such as Bluetooth or WiFi ad hoc mode). This work
also demonstrated the latencies similar to that of [46]. Compared to
this work, the focus of our paper is on out-of-band communication
of different ﬂavors, including phone-to-phone communication in
some cases.
Another related work is SkyNET [42] which makes use of com-
promised personal networks (such as personal WiFi) as a platform
for command and control message dissemination. Other mobile
botnets have been reported in scientiﬁc publications that make use
of other services available on mobile devices for communication
such as SMS/MMS [13, 19, 37, 49, 50] and available open WiFi
networks [26]. Our work, on the other hand, utilizes out-of-band
communication channels for command and control which are much
harder to detect compared to the use of cellular or WiFi services.
The explicit use of steganography for the purpose of undetectable
command and control, as employed in our stego audio channel, is
also inline with Stegobot [39]. This is a botnet architecture that uses
social networking based steganographic channels for command and
control. In particular, image steganography is used to achieve this
goal. Our steganographic audio channel, in contrast, embeds covert
messages which are transmitted in real-time over the air, and not
into static ﬁles or images.
Out-of-band communication in general has been employed in
many security applications before. These include: proximity-based
secure association of personal wireless devices (see surveys and us-
ability studies [20, 22, 27, 28]) and user authentication [43]. Besides
identifying a new application of out-of-band communication, i.e.,
undetected command and control, we have proposed many novel
channels not previously explored.
8. CONCLUSION
The threat of mobile malware is rising rapidly. According to a
recent report by Lookout Security [3], the Android phone users are
becoming more and more vulnerable to malware. The same report
states that, in several cases, legitimate applications were repackaged
with malware code and distributed via the ofﬁcial Android app store
or via updates/advertisements. Android and iPhone botnets have
already been proposed [37, 49]; some have even appeared in the
wild [49]. However, most of these mobile botnets used SMS or the
Internet to build the command and control infrastructure – similar
to traditional botnets, and are therefore detectable via traditional
botnet defense mechanisms.
In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of sensing-enabled
covert channels in mobile phones. Malware using such channels
will be very difﬁcult or impossible to detect using traditional means,
because such the underlying command and control channels ex-
ploit non-network air-gaps to communicate. Our proof-of-concept
prototype exempliﬁes this emerging problem – using off-the-shelf
hardware and popular Android-based mobile phones, we were able
to send surreptitious command and control messages without using
any wireless or cellular networks. Our prototype malware applica-
tion received the messages embedded in music, video, household
lighting, or magnetic ﬁelds.
Malware with the capability of using such sensor-based covert
channels can also open up new threats such as the creation of local-
ized botnets and geo-targeted attacks, which we explored brieﬂy in
the paper.
