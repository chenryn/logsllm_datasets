When searching a username, I often locate confirmed email addresses from several years prior. These 
open new possibilities once provided to our search tools. In 2019, I located an otherwise unknown 
email address associated with my target username. It had been used to post to a hacking forum in 2002. 
The name, email, and username only identified "JohnDoe". This new email account was associated with 
a unique password within the Myspace breach data. Searching the password identified additional email 
accounts within other breach data sets. Searching those accounts within the Usenet data displayed the 
true name of my target. Everyone makes a mistake eventually.

Any time I see a serial killer, active shooter, or otherwise deranged individual in the news, I seek any 
presence within old newsgroups. More often than not, if the subject was tech-sawy in the 90's, 1 find

These should present information which will connect you through the best URLs. However, we have one other 
option. The following Google search presents pages within the website Hack Notice which announce 
ransomware publications.
Opening these pages displays a notice of ransomware intrusion. Clicking the title of the article presents the Tor 
URL which may display the stolen data. Clicking "View Original Source" on this new page will attempt to open 
the Tor URL in your browser. I have discovered terabytes of data this way. While I could spend another chapter 
identifying ransomware data of interest and its value to online investigations, I must stop. If you have made it 
this far into the book, you have the skills to continue your own journey into ransomware exposure.
Real World Application: Once you have built a massive collection of these logs, you can use Ripgrep to query 
them as previously mentioned. In 2021,1 was investigating an unknown person harassing one of my clients. He 
was using a throwaway email address which seemed impossible to trace. It was not present within any breach 
data. However, it appeared within my stealer logs, which included a device name similar to Desktop-u3ty6. 
Searching that device identifier presented dozens of email addresses and passwords in use on that machine. This 
quickly revealed my suspect, a 15-year-old kid. Further investigation confirmed his computer became infected 
after downloading a pirated version of anti-virus software. The irony.
If you found historic breach credentials valuable, recent stealer logs should excite you. These are text files 
containing usernames, email addresses, passwords, browser autofill data, IP addresses, screen captures, and 
system details present on computers infected with a virus. If you download pirated software from shady 
websites, there is a good chance that it is infected with a virus. When you install it, malicious files begin snooping 
on your daily activity. Any data collected is uploaded to rented servers and criminals then sell this data online. 
Since the passwords are fresh, they are more likely to be accurate with current credentials. This presents an awful 
situation for victims, but also an amazing opportunity for investigators. The following Google queries might 
present interesting information, but most results lead to shady criminal marketplaces which require an account 
to see download links. Use extreme caution here.
I present a final warning about disk space. If you replicate all of these steps within a VM which is only’ allocated 
a small disk (less than 100GB), expect to run out of space. If you plan to include data breaches and leaks into 
your daily routine, you might consider a dedicated Linux host Expect frustration, complications, and slow 
queries if using an external drive. The methods presented in this chapter can be conducted within any’ operating 
system as long as the proper utilities are installed. I use a dedicated Linux laptop with a 4TB SSD internal drive 
for my data collection. My queries are fairly fast, and I never worry’ about disk space. My Linux OS provides 
protection from malicious software, and this machine is never used to conduct online investigations. Once you 
see the benefits of this data, you might be walling to make the jump.

OSINT Methodology 459
Se c t io n  III
OSINT METHODOLOGY
This section enters territory I have always avoided in previous editions. We can no longer ignore discussions 
about workflow, documentation, and other formalities of our investigations. It is also time that we tackle the 
ethics surrounding online investigations. These are not easy conversations, and many people will have their own 
opinions. I do not claim to have all of the answers. I only have my own experiences and lessons learned from 
many mistakes.
It is now time to take a breath and get back to basics. You may have been overwhelmed with the techniques 
discussed throughout the previous sections. You may wonder how you will present your findings, create a report, 
and defend your right to access public information from the internet. This section tackles these issues. 
Throughout this section, we present numerous document templates and workflow diagrams. All of these are 
available to you via digital download at the following URL.
I rely heavily on assistance from my friend and colleague Jason Edison throughout this entire section. Jason is a 
20-year veteran of a major U.S. police department where he serves as the investigative lead for the agency’s 
Digital Crimes Unit. He has trained thousands of students in the public and private sectors on various topics 
related to open source intelligence and cyber-crime investigations. In fact, he is an official IntelTechniques 
OSINT instructor who travels the world presenting my methods. He also maintains the IntelTechniques online 
video training courses at IntelTechniques.net. Most of the content in this section is directly from him. I maintain 
the first-person usage of "I" throughout the section. It is a collective "I” from both of us.
In the late 9O's, I was tasked to investigate a computer-related crime involving inappropriate online contact from 
a registered sex offender to children in his neighborhood. The internet was new to most people; AOL dial-up 
connections were common; and there was very little monitoring or enforcement in place. 1 contacted the subject 
at his home and conducted an interview. He admitted to inappropriate behavior and showed me the evidence 
on his computer. I had no forensic imaging machine or acquisition methods. I didn't even have a digital camera. 
I had my notepad and pen. Months later, I testified about the illegal activity this suspect conducted with local 
diildren. I verbally explained what I observed on his computer without any digital evidence. It was a very 
different time, and would never be acceptable today. Current prosecution would require forensic acquisition, 
detailed logs, and pictorial proof of every step. This is a good thing, but presents a higher demand toward your 
own documentation and overall OSINT methodology. Without digital evidence, the computer crime or online 
incident you are investigating never happened. Without proper training and policies, your evidence may never 
be considered. Without confidence in your work, you may not be taken seriously.
Jason and I do not agree on everything presented here. This is why you see alternative tools and methods which 
may contradict each other. This is a good thing. We need as many thoughts and opinions as possible in order to 
present ideas applicable to many situations. As an example, I try not to use Microsoft or Google products unless 
absolutely necessary7.1 have forced myself to use Linux whenever possible, and avoid closed-sourced tools which 
"call home". Jason prefers Microsoft OneNote, which is extremely robust. His need for an ideal note-taking 
solution outweighs my paranoia of metadata collection by Microsoft. He prefers Chrome while I insist on 
Firefox. Neither of us are right or wrong. We simply have strong preferences. We only hope to present numerous 
options which may help you choose the best methods for your own investigations. Only you can decide what is 
most appropriate for your daily workload.

The first step in most investigations is what we in law enforcement refer to as "intake". This is the process of 
receiving a mission assignment from a supervisor or fielding a request for investigative support from another 
internal unit or outside agency. For those in the private sector, this might be accepting a contract investigation 
from a client or conducting a security assessment as part of your normal duties. The following are examples of 
OSINT requests that we receive on a regular basis:
Triage is the practice of assessing a situation or mission to calculate an approach that is likely to result in the 
best possible outcome. A common mistake that is made when working OSINT investigations is to rush to action 
with no clear plan or direction. You should take time at the beginning of a mission to ensure you are following 
a productive path to relevant answers. Depending on the urgency of the situation, this step could be 30 seconds 
or 30 minutes. The important thing is to make a plan of attack and move forward with purpose rather than just 
bush-whacking your way through the internet. Here are some of the key considerations during the triage phase 
of your investigation.
This chapter assumes you have already completed the steps laid out in the previous sections of this book. You 
will need familiarity with each of those tools and techniques if you wish to take full advantage of the 
recommended workflow. If you have an existing investigative process, there will likely be pieces shared here that 
can be folded into your current procedures. The examples used here were chosen purely for demonstration 
purposes and not due to any association with ongoing criminal investigations.
An often overlooked component of open source intelligence gathering is the importance of establishing an 
efficient and repeatable workflow. You need to be thoughtful and deliberate in how you proceed on an 
investigation rather than wading in haphazardly. As an instructor, one of the most common stumbling blocks 
with which I see new practitioners struggle is putting the tools into action in a fashion that results in a 
professional looking work product. This section provides a step by step walkthrough of the entire investigative 
process, from receiving an OSINT assignment all the way to submitting a professional case report
• 
Threat Assessments (Individuals): Online threats to carry out an act that we wish to prevent Who 
is this person? Where are they? What is their capability and true intent5
• 
Threat Assessments (Events): Monitor intelligence prior to and during a significant event that 
impacts the organization or region of responsibility. Who is involved? What are their intentions? What 
is the scale of impact on available resources?
• 
Target Profiles (Individuals): Uncover the target’s entire online presence, including email addresses, 
home addresses, friends, hobbies, etc.
• 
Target Profiles (Organizations): Uncover an organization’s online footprint and/or entire 
technological infrastructure. This can be a business, criminal enterprise, or group of individuals 
organized to pursue a shared goal.
• 
Subscriber Identification/Account Attribution: Identify the real person associated with a domain, 
IP address, or online account. Who runs a malicious website? Which child predator has web traffic 
through this IP address?
The following recommendations can be applied to any of these common investigative scenarios. More than 
anything else, the key to success is staying organized and having a repeatable process.

Be certain of the mission objectives. If you ask a professional analyst to describe the first step they take in any 
assessment, they will tell you that it is to identify the question. This of course could be multiple questions, but 
the important thing is that you articulate the investigative goals. This can be a verbal or written confirmation, 
depending on your situation, but written is preferred should the other party later misremember the conversation.
If you work in support of law enforcement, you should consider if there is likely to be a legal request made to 
any known social media platforms. For example, if a Gmail address was involved in a crime, you might want to 
issue a preservation letter to Google requesting that they retain any data related to the specified address. The 
preservation letter is issued in anticipation of a future subpoena or search warrant for account data, such as 
subscriber information. If you are unsure of whom to contact at a particular provider in order to submit this 
request, a good starting point is the ISP list at https://www.search.org/resources/isp-list/. Try to get a live 
person on the phone rather than just sending an email. Build rapport with the support person or legal contact 
and shepherd them into doing the right thing based on the urgency of the situation. No one wants to be 
responsible for a teen suicide or the next school shooting. Often, they will be much more cooperative and 
productive if they feel invested in the situation.
Include in your verification any specific identifiers (email addresses, names, phone numbers, IP addresses, etc.) 
that were originally provided by the requestor. It gives them a chance to catch an}’ typos or miscommunications. 
They may have given you the email address of the victim rather than the suspect. Those types of mix-ups occur 
frequently and can waste a lot of valuable investigative time and resources if not caught and corrected early on. 
That quick clarification also defines the primary goals for our investigations, similar to the following.
The first benefit of articulating the questions is establishing a clear set of expectations with the person asking 
you to do the work. This could be a supervisor, contract client, colleague, or victim of a crime. Do not overthink 
it. An example could be: "To be clear, you want to know the real name and physical addresses associated with 
the person in control of the email account of PI:EMAIL, and we 
accomplish this. Is this correct?"
When it comes time to write your investigative report, these questions should be clearly addressed in the 
summary of key findings. Taking the time to articulate and clarify mission goals up front lays the groundwork 
for your final work product. You should also ask questions regarding the source of any initial leads or other 
intelligence on your target. Why do we believe that email address belongs to our suspect? How was that lead 
obtained and how certain are we that it is correct? Information is not intelligence until it has context. You 
need to ask questions up front to establish any available context for the target. Do we know anything about their 
location or culture? Are they into video games or an avid pro-baseball fan? Once you get to the research phase 
of the investigation, you will have a far easier time locating pages, accounts, and identifiers related to your target 
if you start learning about his or her day to day life. Never assume that the person tasking you with this work is 
giving you all available information. Ask questions and be persistent.
Not all investigations involve infiltration into criminal organizations. However, when they do, you may want to 
check with colleagues in other agencies to make sure you are not stepping on any ongoing investigations. This 
could also save you time should you locate an investigator who has already laid groundwork into the online 
communities in question. We always want to be respectful of another professional's work and collaborate 
whenever operationally appropriate. In the past, I have concluded long-term investigations only to find out later 
that other teams were running operations in that community at the same time. While reviewing the case, we 
found that we had wasted time working to gain reputation with users who, unbeknownst to us, were other
