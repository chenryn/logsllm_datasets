### Issue Description

When using version `2.5.x-dev` (commit `7e573f4`), an error occurs in the `appDevDebugProjectContainer`:

**Error:**
```
PHP Fatal error: Cannot redeclare appDevDebugProjectContainer::$parameters
in /home/vagrant/var/www/app/cache/dev/appDevDebugProjectContainer.php on line 22
```

### Potential Cause

The error might be originating from the following line in the `PhpDumper` class:
- **File:** `symfony/src/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Dumper/PhpDumper.php`
- **Line:** 846
- **Code:**
  ```php
  private $parameters;
  ```

### Analysis

The error indicates that the property `$parameters` is being declared more than once in the `appDevDebugProjectContainer` class. This could be due to a duplication or an incorrect merge during the container generation process.

### Suggested Solution

1. **Clear the Cache:**
   - Clear the Symfony cache to ensure that no old or corrupted files are being used.
   ```bash
   php bin/console cache:clear --env=dev
   ```

2. **Check for Duplicates:**
   - Inspect the `appDevDebugProjectContainer.php` file for any duplicate declarations of the `$parameters` property.
   - Ensure that the `PhpDumper` class is not generating the property multiple times.

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with the current version of Symfony.
   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

4. **Review Custom Code:**
   - If you have any custom code or overrides, review them to ensure they are not causing the duplication.

### Additional Debugging Steps

- **Enable Debug Mode:**
  - Enable debug mode to get more detailed error messages and stack traces.
  ```yaml
  # config/packages/dev/framework.yaml
  framework:
      debug: true
  ```

- **Check Logs:**
  - Check the Symfony logs for any additional information that might help in diagnosing the issue.
  ```bash
  tail -f var/log/dev.log
  ```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the duplicated property declaration.
