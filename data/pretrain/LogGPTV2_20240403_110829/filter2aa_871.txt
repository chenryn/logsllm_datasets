Coming of Age
The number isn’t important, friends have been saying when
I talk about turning sixty. Some say, age is only a state of
mind. Some say, you’re as young as you feel. Some say,
age doesn’t matter.
And some say, why, you look great! which unfortunately
confirms that there really are three stages of life: youth,
middle-age, and you look great!
Well, my well-intended friends, I am here to tell you that
age does matter. In some ways, it matters a LOT.
When older people and younger people talk, they look at
each other differently.  Younger people have a shorter gaze.
I was taught the meaning of a long gaze by a high school
teacher, Miss McCutcheon, who gave me her long teacher’s
gaze during an English class. I felt like a butterfly, pinned
and wriggling. When another student asked what she was
seeing, she said simply, “Some day someone is really going
to love that boy.”
I couldn’t handle that. I was fifteen, fat and self-conscious
and confused, and I squirmed, turned red and snapped
something back ... but have never forgotten what she said.
At a time when love seemed beyond my reach, her insight
was deeper than mine, living as I did half-blind and half-
crazy in an adolescent storm of rain hail and thunder.
Coming up to sixty, we see other people, especially
younger ones, more often with that long look. We see who
they are and who they can become if they only attend to the
better angels of their natures.
Sometimes there are moments during such conversations
when it feels as if the years fall away and transparencies of
other conversations, ones that happened years ago, meld
with the one I am having now. Memories control the
present moment, capturing it with a force field of longing
and grief before the experience becomes transparent to its
underlying dynamics, the irrevocability of my own past
juxtaposed with seemingly innumerable futures for the one
to whom I am speaking, branching like blossoms of
forbidden opportunity. 
Then the regret fades, replaced by encompassing
acceptance of the only life we have to live. 
We may not know how to say what we know in such a
moment, but we do know and we know that we know.
We are no longer innocent, coming to sixty. We know what
evils can befall us. We know as Robert Frost said that there
are finalities besides the grave. We know ourselves,
sometimes too well. We remember too many people we
have loved and held as they died.  Somehow the degree to
which we have lived with passion and gusto informs our
awareness of death as well as our love of life. 
Two recent movies, Lost In Translation and Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, capture magnificently the
poignancy of moments of love and loss, showing
connections deep bone-in-the-socket solid for only a
moment before the whirlwinds of our lives take us again in
different directions. 
I love good films the way I loved good books as a child.
Coming up to sixty, I accept that being a latchkey kid and
losing my parents early gave me a particular destiny.
William Gibson, the cyberpunk writer, notes at his web site
that many writers share that kind of loss or other early
childhood trauma. We find solace in the world of
imagination and images, building meaning from the tools at
hand.  Books and films provide points of reference for
sharing insights, giving us a common language. 
In another great film, My Dinner with Andre, Wallace
Shawn and Andre Gregory say that a moment of genuine
connection with another person heightens our awareness of
being alone, too, and to accept that we’re alone is to accept
death, because somehow when you’re alone you’re alone
with death.
That’s the implicit affirmation when the protagonist of
Eternal Sunshine says OK. OK. to a doomed trajectory of
romantic love. It is also the moment of genius at the end of
Lost in Translation when the director/writer makes the final
words whispered by Bill Murray in the ear of his young
friend impossible to hear. 
It doesn’t matter what he said, and it doesn’t matter what I
say either. We always fail to articulate what we
nevertheless unceasingly try to say, the deepest truths we
know, which can only be suggested like the moment of
waking from a dream more real than the sunlight streaming
through the window, when we know we will never
remember the dream exactly but nevertheless have another
day, another day, another day in which to pursue it.
Coming to sixty does make a difference. It is clear that
what we mistook for achievement is empty air, unless it
made a real contribution, unless it made a difference, it is
clear that mostly self-serving efforts deliver as much
satisfaction as drinking from a dribble glass. 
Still, we are left with questions, not answers. 
Which were the moments of genuine self-transcendence in
which I was called to be more than I thought I was and
somehow fulfilled the promise? Which did I miss? What is
possible in the time left, as eyesight fades but the sharper-
eyed inner gaze of an ancient mariner discerns with greater
clarity what matters most?
If we are fortunate, the choices we make now, coming to
sixty, were determined many years ago when earlier
decisions built the karma of our destiny. We all fail, and we
all succeed. There is nothing now but the sudden
unexpected opportunity, nothing but being ready. There is
nothing to hold back, no energy to save for another day. 
I know that I am alone with life and death. Even in
moments of the deepest communion,  I can feel the world
turn and the spiraling universe bend away from my
embrace. Moments of dizzying lucidity, seeing the anchor
of the life given and the life received for what it is,
counterweight or ballast, nothing amassed.
