**Coming of Age**

When I mention turning sixty, friends often reassure me that the number is insignificant. Some say, "Age is just a state of mind." Others claim, "You're as young as you feel." A few even assert, "Age doesn't matter."

And then there are those who exclaim, "Why, you look great!"—a comment that, unfortunately, confirms the existence of three distinct stages of life: youth, middle age, and the phase where people tell you that you look great.

Well, my well-meaning friends, I am here to tell you that age does matter. In many ways, it matters a great deal.

When older and younger people converse, they perceive each other differently. Younger individuals tend to have a shorter gaze. I learned the significance of a long, meaningful gaze from Miss McCutcheon, my high school English teacher. She once gave me such a gaze during class, making me feel like a butterfly pinned and wriggling. When another student asked what she saw, she simply replied, "Someday, someone is really going to love that boy."

I couldn't handle that. At fifteen, I was overweight, self-conscious, and confused. I squirmed, blushed, and snapped back a retort, but her words have stayed with me. At a time when love seemed out of reach, her insight was profound, cutting through the adolescent storm of rain, hail, and thunder.

Approaching sixty, we often see others, especially the young, with that same long, discerning gaze. We see who they are and who they can become if they nurture their better qualities.

Sometimes, during these conversations, the years seem to fall away, and memories of past dialogues merge with the present. These moments are captured in a force field of longing and grief, revealing the irrevocability of my own past juxtaposed with the seemingly infinite futures of the person I'm speaking to, branching like blossoms of forbidden opportunity. 

Then, the regret fades, replaced by an encompassing acceptance of the only life we have to live. We may not know how to express what we understand in such moments, but we do know, and we know that we know.

At sixty, we are no longer innocent. We understand the evils that can befall us, as Robert Frost said, there are finalities beyond the grave. We know ourselves, sometimes too well, and we remember the loved ones we held as they died. The degree to which we have lived with passion and gusto informs our awareness of death as well as our love of life.

Two recent films, *Lost in Translation* and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, capture the poignancy of love and loss, showing deep, bone-in-the-socket connections that last only a moment before the whirlwinds of life take us in different directions.

I love good films the way I loved good books as a child. Approaching sixty, I accept that being a latchkey kid and losing my parents early shaped my destiny. William Gibson, the cyberpunk writer, notes on his website that many writers share similar losses or early childhood traumas. We find solace in the world of imagination and images, building meaning from the tools at hand. Books and films provide points of reference for sharing insights, giving us a common language.

In the film *My Dinner with Andre*, Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory discuss how a genuine connection with another person heightens our awareness of being alone. To accept that we are alone is to accept death, for when you are alone, you are alone with death.

This is the implicit affirmation when the protagonist of *Eternal Sunshine* says, "OK. OK." to a doomed trajectory of romantic love. It is also the moment of genius at the end of *Lost in Translation* when the director/writer makes the final words whispered by Bill Murray in the ear of his young friend impossible to hear. It doesn’t matter what he said; we always fail to articulate the deepest truths we know, which can only be suggested, like the moment of waking from a dream more real than the sunlight streaming through the window, knowing we will never remember it exactly but still have another day, another day, another day to pursue it.

Reaching sixty does make a difference. It becomes clear that what we once mistook for achievement is empty unless it made a real contribution. Self-serving efforts deliver as much satisfaction as drinking from a dribble glass.

Still, we are left with questions, not answers. Which were the moments of genuine self-transcendence, where I was called to be more than I thought I was and somehow fulfilled that promise? Which did I miss? What is possible in the time left, as eyesight fades but the sharper-eyed inner gaze of an ancient mariner discerns with greater clarity what truly matters?

If we are fortunate, the choices we make now, at sixty, were determined many years ago when earlier decisions built the karma of our destiny. We all fail, and we all succeed. There is nothing now but the sudden, unexpected opportunity, nothing but being ready. There is no energy to save for another day.

I know that I am alone with life and death. Even in moments of the deepest communion, I can feel the world turn and the spiraling universe bend away from my embrace. Moments of dizzying lucidity, seeing the anchor of the life given and the life received for what it is—counterweight or ballast, nothing amassed.
