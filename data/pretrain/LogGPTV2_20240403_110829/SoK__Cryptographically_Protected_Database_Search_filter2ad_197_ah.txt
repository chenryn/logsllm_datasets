conditions, many design decisions such as the schema and the
choice of which indices to build must be made before data is
ingested and stored on the server. In particular, if an index has
not been built for a particular ﬁeld, then it simply cannot be
searched without returning the entire database to the querier.
In general, it is not possible to dynamically permit a type of
search without retrieving the entire dataset.
Additionally, if the database malfunctions, debugging eﬀorts
are complicated by the reduced visibility into server processes
and logs. More generally, protected search systems are more
complicated to manage and don’t yet have an existing com-
munity of qualiﬁed, certiﬁed administrators.
Throughout this work we’ve identiﬁed a few transient limita-
tions that can (and should!) be mitigated with future advances.
Each potential user must make her own judgment as to whether
the value of improved security outweighs the performance
limitations.
VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
Several established and startup companies have commercial-
ized protected search. Most of these products today use the
𝙻𝚎𝚐𝚊𝚌𝚢 technique, but we believe both 𝙲𝚞𝚜𝚝𝚘𝚖 and 𝙾𝚋𝚕𝚒𝚟
approaches will ﬁnd their way into products with broad user
bases.
Governments and companies are ﬁnding value in lacking
access to individuals’ data [159]. Proactively protecting data
mitigates the (ever-increasing) risk of server compromise,
reduces the insider threat, can be marketed as a feature, and
frees developers’ time to work on other aspects of products
and services. The recent HITECH US Health Care Law [160]
establishes a requirement to disclose breaches involving more
than 500 patients but exempts companies if the data is en-
crypted: “if your practice has a breach of encrypted data [...]
it would not be considered a breach of unsecured data, and
you would not have to report it” [161].
Protected database technology can also open up new mar-
kets, such as those cases where there is great value in recording
and sharing information but the risk of data spills is too high
For example, companies recognize the value of sharing cyber
threat and attack information [162], but uncontrolled sharing
of this information presents a risk to reputation and intellectual
property.
This paper provides a snapshot of current protected search
solutions. There is currently no dominant solution for all use
cases. Adopters need to understand system characteristics and
tradeoﬀs for their use case.
Protected databases will see widespread adoption. Protected
search has developed rapidly since 2000, advancing from linear
time equality queries on static data to complex searches on
dynamic data, now within overhead between 30%-500% over
standard SQL.
At the same time, the database landscape is rapidly chang-
ing, specializing, adding new functionality, and federating
approaches. Integrating protected search in a uniﬁed design
requires close interaction between cryptographers, protected
search designers, and database experts. To spur that integra-
tion, we describe a three pronged approach to this collabora-
tion: 1) developing base queries that are useful in many appli-
cations, 2) understanding how to combine queries to support
multiple applications, and 3) rapidly applying techniques to
emerging database technologies.
DBMSs are more than just eﬃcient search systems; they
are highly optimized and complex systems. Protected search
has shown that database and cryptography communities can
work together. The next step is to transform protected search
systems into protected DBMSs.
