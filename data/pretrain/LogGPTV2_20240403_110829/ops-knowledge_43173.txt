Question: An online discussion suggests that modern browser frame isolation is sufficient to prevent all security vulnerabilities associated with embedding content from different sources. Analyze the statement and select the option that best refutes this claim, based on your understanding of web security and frame isolation.
"A": "Frame isolation completely prevents the outer page from accessing the inner page, eliminating all cross-site scripting risks.",
"B": "Frame isolation does not address the risk of clickjacking attacks, where a malicious iframe can trick users into clicking unintended elements.",
"C": "Modern browsers' frame isolation enforces same-origin policy, therefore no external content can be embedded, which negates the risk.",
"D": "Frame isolation protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, as the outer page is unable to modify the inner page content."
Answer: B
