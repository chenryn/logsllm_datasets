User: I am writing a package manager in python for users to install programs we write at work.
When 'installing' a new tool (which is just a process of copying files/folders from locations on a server to the users' computer), it may fail before completion for whatever reason.
If this happens, I need a way to 'undo' all the changes made on the users' PC (I remove anything that was copied across).
What techniques are there to implement this sort of 'revert' functionality?
(Windows only solution)
Assistant: You could have two solutions
First is to 
1. copy the files into a temp folder and on success
2. remove the old folder 
3. move the temp folder into the new one if
Second is to 
1.copy the files into a directory, versioned by name, something like C:\Programs\v2, v3, v4 etc. 
2. If everything is ok, you create a junction point or a symlink to the destination you want.
