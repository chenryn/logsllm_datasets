### Issue Report

**Electron Version:** v0.37.5  
**Operating System:** Fedora Workstation 23

#### Description
In the latest version of Electron, I am experiencing an issue where the `<webview>` tag is not functioning as expected. The element is present in the document, but Electron appears to be ignoring it. Conversely, the `<iframe>` tag seems to work correctly.

#### Setup
I have configured the elements in a manner similar to the following:

```html
<webview src="your-source-here"></webview>
<iframe src="your-source-here"></iframe>
```

**Note:** I am aware that GitHub is not loading within the iframe; this is **not** the error I am reporting. The issue is specifically with the `<webview>` tag.
