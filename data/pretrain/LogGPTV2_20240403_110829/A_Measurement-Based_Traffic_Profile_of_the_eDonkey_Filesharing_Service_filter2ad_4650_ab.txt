# eDonkey P2P File-Sharing Service: A Measurement-Based Traffic Profile

## 1. Introduction
This paper presents a traffic profile for the eDonkey P2P file-sharing service, based on empirical measurements. The study reveals significant differences between download and non-download flows, which must be considered separately to accurately model the traffic. 

## 2. Flow Holding Time Analysis
### 2.1 Non-Download Flows
Non-download connections are typically short and less sensitive to TCP flow control. Figure 3 shows the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the flow holding times for both download and non-download streams.

**Figure 3. CCDF of the Observed eDonkey Flow Holding Time**

- **(a) Download, Outbound**
- **(b) Non-Download, Outbound**
- **(c) Download, Inbound**
- **(d) Non-Download, Inbound**

The CCDFs for download connections (parts (a) and (c)) exhibit a moderate decrease, resembling a linear decay in a log-log plot. In contrast, the CCDFs for non-download streams (parts (b) and (d)) decrease rapidly and irregularly, with little difference between inbound and outbound directions.

### 2.2 Correlation of eDonkey TCP Flow Holding Time and Flow Size
Figure 4 illustrates the correlation between the TCP holding time and the size of eDonkey flows. Each dot represents an observed eDonkey flow, with brighter dots indicating identified download flows and darker dots representing non-download connections.

**Figure 4. Correlation of eDonkey TCP Holding Time and Flow Size**

The scatter plot shows that almost all identified download flows are concentrated in a specific region, with minimal overlap with non-download flows. This feature enables the classification of download streams by their size and holding time, rather than using computationally intensive pattern recognition of protocol opcodes. The application-level timeout of 40 seconds is also clearly visible.

## 3. Flow Interarrival Time Analysis
The average flow interarrival time was 0.310 seconds. Download flows have a significantly higher interarrival time compared to non-download streams, as shown in Figure 5.

**Figure 5. eDonkey Flow Interarrival Time**

- **(a) Download, Outbound**
- **(b) Non-Download, Outbound**
- **(c) Download, Inbound**
- **(d) Non-Download, Inbound**

The CCDFs of the eDonkey flow interarrival times reveal an exponential decay, consistent with recent eDonkey measurements [4]. The high frequency of non-download flows generally reduces link throughput [7].

## 4. Average Bandwidth Analysis
The average bandwidth of eDonkey connections was analyzed, considering both the plain bandwidth (total data transmitted over the connection holding time) and the busy bandwidth (data transmitted during active periods, excluding idle times).

**Figure 6. eDonkey Average Bandwidth**

- **(a) Download, Outbound**
- **(b) Non-Download, Outbound**
- **(c) Download, Inbound**
- **(d) Non-Download, Inbound**

The average plain bandwidth for all eDonkey flows is 109 bps, influenced by idle periods at the end of TCP flows. The average net bandwidth is 716 bps. The CCDFs show that the average busy bandwidth has a delayed and stronger decay compared to the plain bandwidth, especially for non-download streams. This suggests using the average busy bandwidth for more accurate modeling.

## 5. Origin and Destination of eDonkey Traffic
The origin and destination of the observed eDonkey flows were mapped to Autonomous Systems (AS). Table 3 lists the top 7 ASs in terms of traffic volume, with the German Telecom (DTAG) being the dominant AS. This indicates that the majority of the observed traffic is locally distributed rather than globally.

## 6. Related Work
Traffic and behavior models for P2P services can be classified into three main categories: multiple peer characteristics, content or shared resources, and individual peer behavior. Models for multiple peer characteristics include characterizations of P2P overlay network topology, variability, and wide-area network traffic patterns. Content characterization includes models for file popularity and file size. Individual peer behavior can be modeled using state models describing different states such as idle, down, active, searching, or responding.

A comprehensive traffic model for the Kazaa P2P file-sharing service was investigated in [17].

## 7. Conclusion
This study provides a detailed traffic profile for the eDonkey P2P file-sharing service, highlighting the need to consider download and non-download flows separately. The traffic caused by eDonkey does not seem to worsen the "mice and elephants" phenomenon, but further investigation is necessary. Future work will focus on defining a detailed traffic model for eDonkey flows, and the observed origins and destinations suggest that network operators should aim to keep traffic within their AS.
