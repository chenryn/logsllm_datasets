User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to troubleshoot this memory usage? I have a classifieds website.

I use PHP, MySql, and SOLR.

Solr uses a Servlet Container, in my case JETTY, which is java application.

I just noticed that something was terribly wrong on my website. I opened the terminal and entered the "top" command and noticed that JAVA was EATING all the cpu and mem.

Now I thought "Ok, maybe I need more mem and cpu" So I increased it. But along with the increase the java app started eating more.

This has never happened before, and it is either a bug, or a hack of some kind.

Anyways, I need to troubleshoot this now, and so I wonder how do I do this?

Can I somehow pinpoint exactly when the memory usage started to go up from some error log?

How does one troubleshoot this?

How do I prevent it? Is it possible to prevent too many requests somehow, if they are within a timeline?

Thanks

Assistant: How much RAM are you using? SOLR has a known issue dealing with FieldCache which can cause it to eat huge amounts of memory while doing sorted searches. 

Edit:

Okay, try using pmap -d on your big three processes (httpd/php, MySQL, Jetty) and see if some sub-library is eating up all your memory.
