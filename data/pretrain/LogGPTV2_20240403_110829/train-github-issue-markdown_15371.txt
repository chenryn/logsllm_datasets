**What is the current behavior?**  
When using a number input that has a defaultValue, you cannot enter a decimal
value. When attempting to type a decimal, the cursor is moved to the beginning
of the input. This behavior is _not_ observed when there is no defaultValue
given.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem viahttps://jsfiddle.net or similar
(template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**

**What is the expected behavior?**  
The input should allow you to type a decimal.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
This is happening with React 15.3.2. It does _not_ happen in 0.14.x
