Figure 1. Laboratory Test Set-up for the Evaluation of UD Emissions Impact on TV 
Signals.
In the above calculation, a simple dipole antenna is assumed.  The emission limit field strength is 
converted into signal power (dBm).  In the laboratory test, the interference power level is 
adjusted by varying the transmission power.  The receiving power calibration is done at 3 meters 
from the emission point for the power levels calculated above. 
The laboratory set-up for the evaluation of the ATSC 8-VSB receiver is presented in Figure 1. 
The set-up is divided into three sections: Transmitter, Channel and Receiver.  
The laboratory measurements were conducted at a distance between the UD and the DTV or 
NTSC receivers of 3 meters.  The resulting receiver de-sensitisation measurement was recorded. 
The test procedures are attached (Annex 1).

The Threshold of Visibility (TOV) was recorded for viewing DTV pictures over a 20 seconds 
period.  The ITU-R Grade 3 performance (slightly annoying audio, video, and colour) for NTSC 
was recorded.  The power levels recorded were in 1-dB step-size.  
The tests were conducted using one video sequence for DTV and one video test pattern for NTSC 
(colour bars).  The tests investigated the de-sensitisation effects due to UD interference without and 
with existing off-air interference. 
The tests were done on Off-Air Channels 52 to 54 and 24 to 26.  As a reference, Figure 2 and 3 
show the off-air spectrum plot of 698-716 MHz and 530-548 MHz. It is noteworthy that there is no 
other interference source detected in that spectrum band of Figure 2.   Figure 3 shows an existing 
NTSC signal of -57.0 dBm peak power on channel 24. 
An UD interference signals were used with a 3 dB bandwidths of 30 MHz.  The spectrums of the 
signals are presented in Figures 4 and 5.  Based on the spectrum plots, there is little multipath
distortion at a 3 meters site.

Results of the Laboratory Test 
The results of the following laboratory experiments listed below are presented in this section: 
-
De-sensitisation of DTV receivers in an indoor environment. 
-
De-sensitisation of NTSC receivers in an indoor environment.
3.1  
De-Sensitisation of DTV Receivers in an Indoor Environment 
The DTV signal and the UD sideband signals were transmitted and received in the same room.  
The calibration was done at a distance of 3 meters from the DTV receiver as specified by the 
FCC NPRM and explained in the test procedure in Annex 1.  For channels 52-54, the 
interference signal power was adjusted to obtain -89.5 dBm/120 kHz at 3 meters and for 
channels 24-26, the interference signal power was adjusted to obtain -87.1 dBm/120 kHz at 3 
meters. 
Only one DTV receiver was used in these tests. 
The tests were conducted on Off-Air channels 52-54 (698 – 716 MHz) without any external off-
air interference.  The tests were also conducted on Off-Air channels 24-26 (530 – 548 MHz) with 
an existing NTSC signal.  The results are presented in Table 1 and 2 for the tests conducted 
without and with external interference respectively.

*: The existing interference is a NTSC signal of -57.0 dBm peak power. 
It was noticed that the receiver sensitivity varies in a +/-1 dB range for different test points.  This 
is attributed to one or all of these factors:  multipath distortion, noise floor variation, tuner 
performance, and other interference mechanisms. 
It was also observed that signal reflection within the building created standing waves. The result 
of this phenomenon was that the received signal could be up to 3 dB higher than what it would 
be for free-space propagation.  There were also signal “nulls” in the room, which could result in 
signal level drops of several dB over small changes in location.

3.2  
De-Sensitisation of NTSC Receivers in an Indoor Environment 
The NTSC and the interference signals were transmitted and received in the same room. The 
calibration was done at 3m as explained in the test procedure in Annex 1.  For channels 52-54, 
the interference signal power was adjusted to obtain -89.5 dBm/120 kHz at 3 meters and for 
channels 24-26, the interference signal power was adjusted to obtain -87.1 dBm/120 kHz at 3 
meters. 
The de-sensitisation tests were carried out on Off-Air channels 52-54 (698 – 716 MHz) without 
any external off-air interference.  The tests were also conducted on Off-Air channels 24-26 (530 
– 548 MHz) with an existing NTSC signal.  The results are presented in Tables 3 and 4 for tests 
conducted without and with external interference respectively.

*: The existing interference is a NTSC signal of -57.0 dBm peak power. 
The test results show that there is more de-sensitisation for NTSC than that of DTV. This is most 
likely because the NTSC system requires a higher S/N to operate.  But for demonstration at FCC, 
we recommend using DTV, since the NTSC test using CCIR Grade 3 has a very soft threshold 
and very difficult for ordinary people to judge.

ANNEX 1: TEST PROCEDURE 
Test Procedure for Unlicensed Devices Interference Signal Emissions into the ATSC DTV 
and NTSC Channel. 
Set Up: 
•
Select an RF channel between CH14 and 69. 
- Make sure there are minimum off-air interference in co- and first adjacent channels. 
•
Interference emissions signals:  
- Filtered random noise, between 18 and 35 MHz BW. 
•
Interference signal power level set up: 
- FCC emission requirement: 200 µV/m, or 46 dBµV/m within a 120 kHz BW. 
- Convert to dBm: P(dBm) = -75.5 + dBµV/m – 20 log(Frequency in MHz)  
- The emission signal level should be measured at 3m from the unlicensed devices, within a 
120 kHz BW. 
- The signal level should be 3 dB below the above calculated emission level P(dBm) to 
avoid possible measurement errors.  Since allowed interference signal power is calculated 
and fed to the receiver directly, the type of antenna used for transmission and reception is 
irrelevant.
•
Wanted signal:
- ATSC and NTSC. 
- TOV, for DTV, and ITU-R Grad 3, for NTSC, are used as the test threshold. 
- Possible test point: 3m, 12m and 18m away from the unlicensed devices. 
- Tests can also be done with signals transmitted thought a wall. 
- Television channel multipath distortion should be minimum. 
DTV TEST 
1. Test at 3 meters with filtered random noise interference emissions signals: 
•
At 3m, measure the off-air interference level (co- and first adjacent-channels), and the 
equipment noise level in 6 MHz and in 120 kHz bandwidth; 
•
Adjust interference emission signal power level, measured 3m away, to be P(dBm) – 3 dB 
over the 120 kHz BW; 
•
Turn off the interference, transmit ATSC DTV, and find TOV, record the transmitted signal 
power level in 6 MHz and in 120 kHz bandwidth; 
•
Turn on the interference emission signal. If DTV reception is not possible, increase the DTV 
signal power level until TOV, record the DTV Tx signal power level in 6 MHz and 120 kHz 
bandwidth. The difference between the DTV signal power level with and without the 
interference emission signal is the receiver de-sensitisation. 
2. Test at 12 meters: 
Communications Research 
Centre Canada 
MSTV Tests – Page 10
•
Keep the interference emission signal power unchanged and moves the test point to 12m. 
•
Repeat the 3m test. 
•
The result will be the de-sensitisation at 12m. 
3. Test at 24 meters: 
•
Keep the interference emission signal power unchanged and moves the test point to 24m,  
•
Repeat the 3m test. 
•
The result will be the de-sensitisation at 24m. 
NTSC TEST 
•
Keep the interference emission signal power unchanged, repeat test at 6m, and 18m with 
NTSC as the wanted signal. 
•
For narrowband interference test, the interference emission signal should be transmitted at 
several in-band frequency locations across 6 MHz channel. 
•
NTSC signal power is measured as peak average power.

Executive Summary 
This report presents the results of measurement made to assess the interference potential to DTV 
and NTSC television reception from the side-lobe emissions of an Unlicensed Device (UD) 
operating in the UHF band, which comply with the Section §15.209(a) of the FCC Rules.  
Section §15.209 (a) of the FCC Rules specify a radiated emission limit of 200 uV/m at a 
measurement distance of 3 meters over frequency range of 215-960 MHz.  The emission limit is 
based on measurement employing a International Special Committee on Radio Interference 
(CISPR) quasi-peak detector with a measurement bandwidth of 120 kHz. 
In general, today’s ATSC DTV receiver minimum signal level is in the range of –78 dBm to –83 
dBm (over 6 MHz BW), which is equivalent to a noise floor of –93 dBm to –98 dBm.  
Measurement results show that the proposed Unlicensed Device side-lobe emission limit will 
cause significant de-sensitisation to DTV and NTSC receivers over a wide area. This is because 
the proposed emission limit is much higher than the receiver equivalent noise floor (–60 dBm to 
–70 dBm over a 6 MHz BW).  The level of de-sensitisation depends on the interference signal 
power bandwidth, distance to the interference source, receiver performance, and test 
environment (indoor, outdoor, etc.). 
Tests were conducted in an indoor environment to determine the desensitisation to digital 
television reception from unlicensed device side-lobe radiated emissions in the clear and when 
the side-lobe radiated emissions are transmitted through a wall. The data shows that for a 
distance of 3 meters, an unlicensed device operating with signal bandwidths of 5.6 MHz and 0.43 
MHz will de-sensitise DTV receivers an average of 24.5 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively.  
Similarly, at a distance of 12 meters, the average de-sensitisation is 15.2 dB and 5.6 dB 
respectively.  At 24 meters, the average de-sensitisation is 11.4 and 4.1 dB respectively. 
Moreover, even when a dry wall is separating an unlicensed device and a DTV receiver, an 
average de-sensitisation of 19.7 dB and 15.2 dB were measured at distances 5 and 12 meters 
respectively, when the unlicensed device is operating with a signal bandwidth 5.6 MHz. 
Similar test were also conducted for NTSC receivers. The data shows that an even greater 
desensitisation for NTSC, when compared to DTV.  For a wideband interference signal  (5.6 
MHz) at 18meters from an analog television receiver, assuming ITU-R Grade 3 picture quality, 
the average desensitisation is 15.3 dB.  For a narrowband signal (0.43 MHz), the desensitisation 
will depend on the location of the interference signal relative to the video and colour carrier of 
the NTSC signal and generally follows the traditional behaviour of the “S” curve. When placed 
in the middle of the TV channel, the average de-sensitisation at 18 meters is 5.6 dB.  At a 6 
meters distance, the desensitisation ranges from 5 dB to 18 dB depending on the location of the 
interference signal relative to the video and colour carrier of the NTSC signal.   If the Threshold 
Of Visibility (TOV) is used as the picture quality threshold, a 10 dB correction (more 
desensitisation) should be added over the ITU-R Grade 3 case. 
The UD could also cause cable ingress, especially for a single shielded RG-59 cable.  The 
ingress level can be up to –44 dBm regardless of whether the cable is terminated or not.

Introduction 
On May 25, 2004, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making  (NPRM) that proposes 
to allow unlicensed radio transmitters to operate in the broadcast television spectrum at locations 
where that spectrum is not being used.  CRC was contracted by MSTV to conduct measurements 
to investigate the possible impact of interference from the unlicensed devices on the current DTV 
and NTSC services. 
Based on the FCC NPRM, the proposed Unlicensed Devices (UD) “radiated emissions that fall 
outside the TV broadcast channel(s) where the device operates must comply with the radiated 
emission limits specified in §15.209(a)”.  Section 15.209(a) of the FCC rules state that “the 
radiated emission limits over frequency band of 215-960 MHz is 200 dBuV/m at a measurement 
distance of 3 meters”.  The emission limit is based on measurement employing a CISPR quasi-
peak detector with a measurement bandwidth of 120 kHz. 
Based on the Commission proposal, CRC conducted measurement to characterise the de-
sensitisation of ATSC DTV and NTSC receivers from the side-lobe radiated emissions of an 
unlicensed portable device.  Specifically the following laboratory evaluations were performed: 
-
De-sensitisation of DTV receivers in an indoor environment. 
-
De-sensitisation of DTV receivers with UD sideband signals transmitted through a dry wall.
-
De-sensitisation of NTSC receivers in an indoor environment.
-
De-sensitisation of NTSC receivers with the narrowband signal transmitted across the NTSC 
channel.
-
Cable ingress created by the UD signals.
2.
Laboratory Test Set-up 
The Unlicensed Devices interference emissions signals were generated using a COFDM 
modulator provided by CRC. The UD emission signals were generated by CRC in such a way as 
to meet the FCC emissions requirement. (i.e. 200 uV/m, or 46 dBuV/m within a 120 kHz 
bandwidth).  The interfering emissions signals were measured at 3 m from the unlicensed 
devices, within a 120 kHz bandwidth. The UD interfering emitted signal power level was 
adjusted to 3 dB below the FCC emission requirement to avoid any impact of measurement error 
on the measurement results. The generated unlicensed devices interference emission signals were 
up-converted, filtered and inserted on the desired DTV or NTSC channel. List below is a 
summary of the relevant parameters and calculations used to conduct these tests: 
FCC emission limit: 200 uV/m, or 46 dBuV/m within 120 kHz 
Convert to dBm: P (dBm) = –75.5 + 46 dBuV/m – 20 log(Frequency in MHz)  
                              = –29.5 – 20 log (Frequency in MHz) 
Interference signal parameters:  
Communications Research

MSTV Tests – Page 5
•
Modulation: 64QAM-OFDM;
•
3-dB bandwidth: 5.57 MHz (wideband), 1.29 MHz (mediumband), 3 x 0.43 MHz, and 0.43 
MHz (narrowband) 
•
Number of OFDM carriers: 5616, 324, 324, and 108; 
•
Guard interval: 1/16; 64QAM modulation.   
To avoid measurement error, the interference level is set at 3 dB below the FCC specified 
limit, thus:
-
For CH-48 (677 MHz), the interference level is –29.5 – 20 log (677) – 3 = –89.1 dBm within 
120 kHz. 
-
For CATV CH-66 (477 MHz), the interference level is –29.5 – 20 log (477) – 3 = –86.1 dBm 
within 120 kHz.  (Note: a CATV NTSC modulator is used in the NTSC system test.  CATV 
and off-air TV have different frequency range, but they all use the same 6 MHz NTSC signal.
CATV CH-66 is equivalent to UHF off-air Channel 14 and 15.)

adjusted by varying the transmission power.  The receiving power calibration is done at 3m from 
the emission point for the power levels calculated above. 
The laboratory set-up for the evaluation of the ATSC 8-VSB receiver is presented in Figure 1. 
The set-up is divided into three sections: Transmitter, Channel and Receiver.  
The laboratory measurements were conducted for distances between the UD and the DTV 
receivers of 3 m, 12 m and 24 m; for the NTSC case, the distances were 6 m and 18 m.  (Note: 
Since the NTSC signal is more sensitive to interference, the test points for NTSC system is 
further away than for the DTV system).  Tests were also conducted with the undesired signals 
transmitted through a wall (typical commercial office dry-wall) and the resulting receiver de-
sensitisation measurement recorded. The test procedures are attached  (Annex 1).  
The Threshold of Visibility (TOV) was recorded for viewing DTV pictures over a 20 seconds 
period. The ITU-R Grade 3 performance (slightly annoying audio, video, colour) for NTSC was 
also recorded.  The power levels recorded were in 1-dB step-size.  
The tests were conducted using one video sequence for DTV and one video test pattern for NTSC 
(colour bar).  The tests investigated the de-sensitisation effects due to UD interference using five 
different DTV receivers and three different NTSC receivers. 
The tests were done on Off-Air Channel 48 (674-680 MHz) for DTV.  Since only a cable TV 
NTSC modulator was available, the NTSC tests were performed in the 474 to 480 MHz band 
(CATV Channel located in the off-air Channel 14 and 15).  All NTSC receivers used in the test 
have cable ready tuner. There are no over-the-air signals on Channel 14 and 15 in the Ottawa 
area where the tests were conducted.
As a reference, Figure 2 shows the off-air spectrum plots of 674-680 MHz and 474-480 MHz. It is 
noteworthy that there is no other interference source detected in these spectrum bands. 
Four different UD interference signals were used with a 3 dB bandwidths of 5.6 MHz, 1.3 MHz, 3 x 
0.43 MHz and 0.43 MHz. The spectrums of the signals are presented in Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Based 
on the spectrum plots, there is little, if any, multipath distortion at a 3m site.

Results Of The Laboratory Test 
The results of the following laboratory experiments listed below  are presented in this section: 
-
De-sensitisation of DTV receivers in an indoor environment. 
-
De-sensitisation of DTV receivers with UD sideband signals transmitted through a dry wall.
-
De-sensitisation of NTSC receivers in an indoor environment.
-
De-sensitisation of NTSC receivers with the narrowband signal transmitted across the NTSC 
channel.
-
Cable ingress created by the UD signals.
3.1   
De-Sensitisation of DTV Receivers In An Indoor Environment 
The DTV signal and the UD sideband signals were transmitted and received in the same room.  
The calibration was done at a distance of 3 m from the DTV receiver as specified by the FCC 
NPRM and explained in the test procedure in Annex 1. The interference signal power was 
adjusted to obtain -89.1 dBm/120 kHz at 3 meters.   
For the 5.6 MHz wideband signal, the total interference power can be calculated as –89.1 + 10 
log (5.6/0.12) = -72.4 dBm. For the 1.3 MHz and 3 x 0.43 MHz bandwidth signals, the total 
interference power is –89.1 + 10 log (1.3/0.12) = -78.8 dBm. For the 0.43 MHz narrow-band 
signal, the total interference power is –89.1 + 10 log (0.43/0.12) = -83.6 dBm.  In all cases, the 
interference power levels were more than 50 dB below the recommended portable UD indoor 
power level at 3m reference point. 
 A total of five DTV receivers were used in these tests. 
The tests were conducted on Off-Air channel 48 (674 – 680 MHz).  The results are presented in 
Table 1, 2 and 3 for the tests conducted at 3 m, 12 m and 24 m respectively.
