**Figure 1: Laboratory Test Set-up for the Evaluation of UD Emissions Impact on TV Signals.**

- **DTV Source**: R&S SFQ
- **NTSC Modulator**: Drake VM 2860
- **ATSC Modulator**: R&S SFQ

In the calculations, a simple dipole antenna is assumed. The emission limit field strength is converted into signal power (dBm). In the laboratory test, the interference power level is adjusted by varying the transmission power. The receiving power calibration is performed at 3 meters from the emission point for the calculated power levels.

### Laboratory Test Setup Description

The laboratory setup for evaluating the ATSC 8-VSB receiver is divided into three sections: Transmitter, Channel, and Receiver. The measurements were conducted with the UD and DTV or NTSC receivers placed 3 meters apart. The resulting receiver de-sensitization was recorded. The test procedures are detailed in Annex 1.

### Measurement Parameters

- **Threshold of Visibility (TOV)**: Recorded for viewing DTV pictures over a 20-second period.
- **ITU-R Grade 3 Performance**: Slightly annoying audio, video, and color for NTSC.
- **Power Levels**: Recorded in 1-dB step-size.
- **Video Sequences**: One video sequence for DTV and one video test pattern (color bars) for NTSC.
- **Tests Investigated**: De-sensitization effects due to UD interference without and with existing off-air interference.

### Frequency Bands and Channels

- **DTV Tests**: Off-Air Channels 52 to 54 (698-716 MHz)
- **NTSC Tests**: Off-Air Channels 24 to 26 (530-548 MHz)
- **Reference Spectra**: Figures 2 and 3 show the off-air spectrum plots of 698-716 MHz and 530-548 MHz, respectively. No other interference sources were detected in the 698-716 MHz band. An existing NTSC signal of -57.0 dBm peak power was detected on Channel 24.

### Interference Signal Characteristics

- **UD Interference Signal**: 3 dB bandwidth of 30 MHz

### Observations

- **Receiver Sensitivity Variability**: +/-1 dB range, attributed to multipath distortion, noise floor variation, tuner performance, and other interference mechanisms.
- **Signal Reflection**: Standing waves and signal nulls in the room, leading to variations in received signal levels.

### Test Procedure (Annex 1)

**Set Up:**
- **RF Channel Selection**: Between CH14 and 69, ensuring minimal off-air interference in co- and first adjacent channels.
- **Interference Emissions**: Filtered random noise, 18-35 MHz BW.
- **Interference Signal Power Level**: FCC emission requirement of 200 µV/m, or 46 dBµV/m within a 120 kHz BW.
- **Wanted Signal**: ATSC and NTSC, using TOV for DTV and ITU-R Grade 3 for NTSC as test thresholds.

**DTV Test:**
1. **3-Meter Test**: Measure off-air interference, adjust interference signal power, find TOV, and record transmitted signal power levels.
2. **12-Meter Test**: Repeat 3-meter test at 12 meters.
3. **24-Meter Test**: Repeat 3-meter test at 24 meters.

**NTSC Test:**
- **Repeat Test**: At 6 meters and 18 meters with NTSC as the wanted signal.
- **Narrowband Interference Test**: Transmit interference at several in-band frequency locations across the 6 MHz channel.
- **NTSC Signal Power**: Measured as peak average power.

### Executive Summary

This report presents the results of measurements to assess the interference potential to DTV and NTSC television reception from the side-lobe emissions of an Unlicensed Device (UD) operating in the UHF band, compliant with Section §15.209(a) of the FCC Rules. The proposed UD side-lobe emission limit causes significant de-sensitization to DTV and NTSC receivers over a wide area. The level of de-sensitization depends on the interference signal power, distance to the source, receiver performance, and test environment.

### Introduction

On May 25, 2004, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) allowing unlicensed radio transmitters to operate in the broadcast television spectrum where it is not being used. CRC was contracted by MSTV to conduct measurements to investigate the possible impact of interference from these devices on current DTV and NTSC services.

### Laboratory Test Set-up

- **Unlicensed Devices Interference Emissions**: Generated using a COFDM modulator provided by CRC.
- **Emission Limit Conversion**: 200 uV/m, or 46 dBuV/m within 120 kHz, converted to dBm.
- **Interference Signal Parameters**: Modulation, bandwidth, number of OFDM carriers, and guard interval.

### Results of the Laboratory Test

- **De-Sensitization of DTV Receivers in an Indoor Environment**: Detailed in Table 1, 2, and 3.
- **De-Sensitization of NTSC Receivers in an Indoor Environment**: Detailed in Table 3 and 4.
- **Cable Ingress Created by the UD Signals**: Significant ingress levels observed, especially for single-shielded RG-59 cable.

### Findings & Observations

- **Significant De-Sensitization**: UD side-lobe emissions cause significant de-sensitization to DTV and NTSC receivers.
- **Distance and Bandwidth Dependence**: De-sensitization varies with distance and interference signal bandwidth.
- **Multipath Distortion and Signal Reflection**: Affect the received signal levels, leading to variability in measurements.
