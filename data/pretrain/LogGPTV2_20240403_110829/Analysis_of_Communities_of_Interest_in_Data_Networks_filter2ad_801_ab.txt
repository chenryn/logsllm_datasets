# Analysis of Communities of Interest in Data Networks

## 1. Introduction
This section provides an overview of the network traffic analysis, focusing on the interactions between local clients and servers over a period of 11 weeks. The analysis characterizes the set of 151 local hosts and their interactions with both other local and internal hosts.

### 1.1 Network Traffic Overview
- **Total Traffic**: 2.6 TBytes of network traffic.
- **Hosts Analyzed**: 151 local hosts.
- **Interaction Types**: Client-to-server and server-to-client.

## 2. Community of Interest (COI) Set Size
We first evaluate the COI of the set of local hosts based on the broadest definition of COI, specifically the number of other hosts that each local host interacts with. We analyze this for all hosts over the entire measurement period.

### 2.1 Scatterplot and CCDF Analysis
- **Figure 1(a)**: Scatter plot of in/out-degree of 151 local hosts.
  - **Y-axis**: Number of clients connecting to the local host (in-degree).
  - **X-axis**: Number of servers the local host connects to (out-degree).
  - **Observation**: Most hosts act as both client and server. For example, 111 hosts are below and 35 hosts above the diagonal line, indicating that most hosts are primarily clients.
  
- **Figure 1(b)**: Empirical Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of the number of machines that local hosts communicate with over the 11-week period.
  - **Local Host Curve**: Total number of hosts (local or internal) that a local host interacts with.
  - **Observation**: 90% of local hosts communicate with fewer than 186 other hosts. A small number of local machines acting as servers have higher numbers of clients, likely corresponding to "real" servers.

## 3. Daily COI Analysis
Next, we analyze the COI of each host on a daily basis and examine the statistical properties of these daily values over the complete observation period.

### 3.1 Maximum Daily COI
- **Figure 2(a)**: CCDF of the maximum daily number of hosts that each local host communicates with.
  - **Observation**: The 90th percentile number for the "Local Host" curve is 77, compared to 186 for the same percentile in Figure 1(b). There is an inflection at the 10% point, likely caused by "real" servers.

### 3.2 Variability of Per-Day COI
- **Figure 2(b)**: CCDF of the normalized standard deviation of per-day COI size.
  - **Observation**: Approximately 70% of local hosts have normalized standard deviations less than 0.5. This suggests that a simplistic approach to detect abnormal behavior based on a policy restricting "normal" per-day COI size would result in false alarms only 5% of the time. The "Local Client" curve is less skewed than the "Local Server" curve, indicating more stable communication patterns for clients.

## 4. Core Communities of Interests
We explore two core COI definitions: Popularity and Frequency COIs, and their interactions.

### 4.1 Popularity COI
- **Definition**: A host is part of the COI if the percentage of target-hosts interacting with it exceeds a threshold.
- **Figure 3**: Size of the Popularity COI set as a function of the threshold.
  - **Observation**: The set size declines as the threshold increases from 0% to 100%. The size distribution is similar across different weeks, suggesting that deviations from this distribution could indicate network anomalies.

### 4.2 Union and Intersection of COI Sets
- **Figure 4(a)**: Sizes of the union and intersection of core COI sets for different time windows.
  - **Observation**: The difference between the union and intersection set sizes (churn) decreases as the threshold increases.
- **Figure 4(b)**: Union and intersection set sizes for increasing time windows.
  - **Observation**: The union set size increases, and the intersection set size decreases sub-linearly with increasing time. The intersection seems to flatten within 6 to 8 weeks, and the union set size does not increase beyond a factor of 2.5.

## 5. Conclusion
The analysis reveals that most hosts act as both clients and servers, and the COI sizes are relatively small and stable over time. This stability suggests that simple anomaly detection approaches based on monitoring COI sizes could be effective in detecting abnormal activities like port scans and worm spreads.
