User: In a multi-server environment, how to ensure that the contents of files on all servers are the same without manual comparison?
Assistant: A Distributed File System (DFS) can be used to solve this problem. DFS is a service that can distribute and share files across multiple servers. When a file is created or modified, DFS automatically transfers the file to all associated servers. This way, the content of the file will remain consistent on all servers. If a server fails, DFS will automatically restore the files on the server to other servers, thus ensuring the reliability and integrity of the files. Commonly used DFS includes Hadoop HDFS, GlusterFS, etc.
