User: I installed Python 2.7.7 :: Anaconda 2.0.1 (64-bit). Currently I am trying to run the command "import cx_Oracle". I ran easy_install which successfully add the cx_Oracle egg to the "site_packages" folder the anaconda directory getting the message "Installed c:\fast\anaconda\2.0.1\lib\site-packages\cx_oracle-5.1.3-py2.7-win-amd64".'
Now whenever I try the command "import cx_Oracle" in the python terminal I get the error "ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application". I tried installing the specific 32-bit version of cx_Oracle but it still resulted in the same output "Installed c:\fast\anaconda\2.0.1\lib\site-packages\cx_oracle-5.1.3-py2.7-win-amd64". 
Has anyone had success fixing this?
Assistant: I had the 32-bit version of oracle client installed. Once I installed the 64-bit version it worked fine.
