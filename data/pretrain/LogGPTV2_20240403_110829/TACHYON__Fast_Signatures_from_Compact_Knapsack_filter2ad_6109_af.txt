† TACHYON requires rejection sampling in its signature generation (similar to BLISS [19], Dilithium [20]). The number of required signature
generation repetitions due to rejection sampling are 3.08, 2.18 and 2.72 for medium, recommended and high security levels, respectively.
‡ Gaussian sampling requirement is same for the all security levels, and therefore, it is represented with a single value.
✓Denotes the scheme requires Gaussian sampling, that can be considered unfavorable due to the side-channel attacks.
∗ Denotes security level other than standard 128, 192, 256 bits.
We also dissected the cost of TACHYON, for future optimizations.
GCK function computation corresponds to the ≈ 40% of the total
cost for TACHYON-128 signature generation, that slightly decreases
on higher security levels. The highest cost is identified as the PRF
calls and the extraction of the binary vectors from this PRF output,
made to deterministically generate the vectors (xi’s). This can be
further confirmed with the improvements observed by caching the
xi vectors, where this cost is eliminated and replaced with only
vector additions. For the signature verification, over 80% of the total
cost is due to the GCK function.
Discussions. The GCK function calculations can be further accel-
erated with assembly instructions on NTT function as in Dilithium
[20]. In this paper, we presented our benchmark results with a ref-
erence implementation, without any assembly level instructions.
Therefore, we believe that there is still a significant room for perfor-
mance improvement for our scheme, especially in the verification
algorithm, where the dominative cost is the GCK function. On the
other hand, since we implemented the PRF functions of our scheme
using Intel intrinsics, TACHYON might face a performance penalty
on other platforms. Therefore, light-weight symmetric ciphers or
11
hash functions should be preferred to implement the PRF calls in
TACHYON on other platforms.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a new digital signature scheme with a
post-quantum promise, which we refer to as TACHYON. Our unique
algorithmic design leverages the well-known HORS construction
and additively homomorphic GCK functions to extend one-time sig-
natures to (polynomially bounded) many-time signatures. TACHYON of-
fers several desirable properties: (i) It achieves the lowest end-to-end
delay with the fastest signature generation and verification among
its counterparts in every security level. (ii) TACHYON has the smallest
private key size (i.e., κ-bit) among its counterparts. (iii) TACHYON has
highly tunable parameters, which offer various speed and storage
trade-offs. (iv) TACHYON does not require any Gaussian sampling,
and therefore it is immune to the side-channel attacks targeting
this function. All these desirable properties of TACHYON come with
a larger public key than most of its counterparts.
