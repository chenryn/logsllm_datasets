### TACHYON: A Post-Quantum Digital Signature Scheme

#### Abstract
In this paper, we introduce TACHYON, a new digital signature scheme with post-quantum security. TACHYON leverages the well-known HORS construction and additively homomorphic GCK functions to extend one-time signatures to many-time signatures. Our scheme offers several desirable properties, including the lowest end-to-end delay, the smallest private key size, highly tunable parameters, and immunity to side-channel attacks targeting Gaussian sampling. These benefits come with a larger public key compared to most counterparts.

#### 1. Introduction
TACHYON is designed to provide a secure and efficient digital signature scheme in the post-quantum era. The scheme utilizes the HORS (Hash to Obtain Random Subset) construction and additively homomorphic GCK (Generalized Compact Knapsack) functions to achieve its goals. This paper details the design, performance, and security aspects of TACHYON.

#### 2. Design and Security
TACHYON's unique algorithmic design combines the HORS construction with GCK functions. The HORS construction is used to generate one-time signatures, while GCK functions are employed to extend these to many-time signatures. This combination ensures that TACHYON can achieve high security levels while maintaining efficiency.

**Security Levels:**
- **Medium Security Level:** 128 bits
- **Recommended Security Level:** 192 bits
- **High Security Level:** 256 bits

**Rejection Sampling:**
TACHYON requires rejection sampling during signature generation, similar to BLISS [19] and Dilithium [20]. The number of required signature generation repetitions due to rejection sampling is:
- 3.08 for the medium security level
- 2.18 for the recommended security level
- 2.72 for the high security level

**Gaussian Sampling:**
Gaussian sampling is not required in TACHYON, making it immune to side-channel attacks targeting this function. This is a significant advantage over other schemes that rely on Gaussian sampling.

#### 3. Performance Analysis
We dissected the cost of TACHYON to identify areas for future optimizations. The GCK function computation accounts for approximately 40% of the total cost for TACHYON-128 signature generation, which slightly decreases at higher security levels. The highest cost is attributed to PRF (Pseudorandom Function) calls and the extraction of binary vectors from the PRF output. Caching the xi vectors can significantly reduce this cost by replacing it with vector additions.

**Signature Verification:**
Over 80% of the total cost in signature verification is due to the GCK function. Accelerating the GCK function with assembly instructions, as done in Dilithium [20], could further improve performance. Our benchmark results are based on a reference implementation without any assembly-level instructions, indicating significant room for performance improvement.

**Platform Considerations:**
The PRF functions in TACHYON are implemented using Intel intrinsics, which may result in a performance penalty on other platforms. For better cross-platform performance, lightweight symmetric ciphers or hash functions should be preferred for PRF calls.

#### 4. Conclusion
TACHYON offers several desirable properties:
1. **Lowest End-to-End Delay:** Fastest signature generation and verification among its counterparts at every security level.
2. **Smallest Private Key Size:** κ-bit private keys, the smallest among its counterparts.
3. **Highly Tunable Parameters:** Various speed and storage trade-offs.
4. **Immunity to Side-Channel Attacks:** No Gaussian sampling required.

These advantages come with a larger public key compared to most counterparts. TACHYON is a promising candidate for post-quantum digital signatures, offering both security and efficiency.
