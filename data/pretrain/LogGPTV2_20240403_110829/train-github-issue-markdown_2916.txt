See: http://plnkr.co/edit/2ecdHTFEZiG3Q4ig8xga?p=preview  
Open dev tools console to see the following error:  
`EXCEPTION: No provider for e! (e -> e)`
If you remove the [ngClass] or the *ngIf it will work fine. Also, if you
change from the .min.js version to the .js or .dev.js version it will work.
**Current behavior**  
Throws `EXCEPTION: No provider for e! (e -> e)`
**Expected/desired behavior**  
To work as it does with the full bundled version.
