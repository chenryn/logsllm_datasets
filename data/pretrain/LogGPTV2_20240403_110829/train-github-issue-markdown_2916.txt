### Steps to Reproduce and Minimal Demo of the Problem

**Demo Link:**  
[Plunker Example](http://plnkr.co/edit/2ecdHTFEZiG3Q4ig8xga?p=preview)

1. Open the provided Plunker link.
2. Open the Developer Tools console (usually accessible via `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3. Observe the following error in the console:
   ```
   EXCEPTION: No provider for e! (e -> e)
   ```

**Observations:**
- The error occurs when using `[ngClass]` or `*ngIf` directives.
- The issue is resolved if you remove either `[ngClass]` or `*ngIf`.
- The problem also disappears if you switch from the `.min.js` version to the `.js` or `.dev.js` version.

### Current Behavior
The application throws the following exception:
```
EXCEPTION: No provider for e! (e -> e)
```

### Expected/Desired Behavior
The application should function correctly, as it does with the full bundled version (`.js` or `.dev.js`).
