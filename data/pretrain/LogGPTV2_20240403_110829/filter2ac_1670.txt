### Title: Blackhat: EU-19 Inside Out - The Cloud Has Never Been So Close

**Abstract:**

The adoption of public cloud infrastructure introduces new management layers and security challenges that must be thoroughly understood and secured. The accessibility of cloud provider application programming interfaces (APIs) via the internet has created a new attack vector for adversaries, enabling them to gain highly privileged access to critical cloud assets. Traditional defense mechanisms, which primarily focus on network, application, and operating system security, are often insufficient to protect against these new threats.

Credential theft is a well-documented attack vector frequently exploited by adversaries. This method is particularly effective because many organizations struggle to implement the principle of least privilege. Cloud resources are typically managed by DevOps, development, and IT teams, who require broad access to perform their roles. Access to APIs is often facilitated through software development kits (SDKs) and dedicated command-line tools. Once these accounts are compromised, attackers can easily gain access to high-value resources with just a single API call.

In this presentation, we introduce an innovative approach to attacking cloud infrastructure. We utilize graph theory to build and illustrate the relationships between different resources, identities, and policies. By mapping these relationships, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit existing features to escalate privileges and gain access to high-value resources. Our goal is to highlight the importance of understanding and securing the complex interdependencies within cloud environments to mitigate these emerging threats.
