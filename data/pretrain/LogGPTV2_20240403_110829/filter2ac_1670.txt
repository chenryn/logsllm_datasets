title:blackhat:eu-19 Inside Out - The Cloud has Never been so Close
The public cloud infrastructure adds new management layer and security challenges that need to be well understood and secured. The fact that cloud provider application programming interfaces (API) are accessible through the internet has opened a new window for adversaries to take advantage and gain highly privileged access to cloud critical assets. Traditional defense mechanism mostly focuses on network, application and operating system defense. The use of public APIs introduces a new attack surface, one that traditional defenses cannot protect.Credential theft is a well-known attack vector used by many adversaries. It is so successful because organizations are struggling to follow the principle of least privilege. The persons who are in charge of cloud resources usually are the DevOps, Development and IT teams who need to manage those resources. Access to APIs performed by using different software development kit (SDK) and dedicated command line tools. Once those accounts are compromised, gaining access to high-value resources is one API call away.In this talk, we present an alternative new approach for attacking cloud infrastructure. We use graphs to build and illustrate the relationships between different resources, identities, and policies. After mapping all the relationships, we show how adversaries can easily abuse existing features to escalate privileges and get to high-value resources.
