User: Is it possible, using the python version of google app engine, to create a thumbnail of a PDF file? 
The goal is for the user to be able to upload a PDF, and see it represented as a thumbnail on the page.
Assistant: No. This requires a PDF renderer, and to the best of my knowledge no such thing exists in pure-Python. You'll have to use an external service to generate thumbnails.
