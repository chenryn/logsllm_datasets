User: What is CDN (Content Delivery Network, Content Distribution Network)? How to use CDN to improve the performance of web application?
Assistant: CDN refers to a network that distributes web content to end users by deploying servers on multiple nodes around the world. Using a CDN can improve the performance of web applications because it caches static resources such as images, videos, and scripts on servers close to end users. In this way, when a user requests these static resources, the CDN can directly provide the cached copy to the user without requesting the resource from the original server, thereby saving bandwidth and request processing time, and accelerating the loading speed of the web page. Using a CDN also spreads the load, improves scalability, and provides additional bandwidth for high-traffic events. To use a CDN, developers need to configure it as part of their web application and modify the Domain Name System (DNS) to point to the CDN provider's servers.
