### P-457: Metabolomics as a Tool to Study the Role of Semiochemicals in Biotic Plant Interactions

**Presenting Author:** Roland Mumm, Wageningen Plant Research, Bioscience, Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Ric C.H. de Vos, Robert D. Hall

**Abstract:**

Plants interact with a diverse array of organisms, forming complex networks of antagonistic (e.g., pests and pathogens) and mutualistic (e.g., pollinators, beneficial microbes) interactions. These interactions are mediated by semiochemicals, which include both volatile and non-volatile compounds. This presentation will highlight the use of metabolomics approaches to study the role of semiochemicals in these interactions.

- **Methods:** Untargeted comprehensive GC-MS and LC-MS profiling were used to identify key semiochemicals involved in attracting or repelling insect pests in crops such as cabbage, hop, and bean species.
- **Results:** Compounds valued for their flavor properties also play a role in plant resistance/susceptibility against pests. In a plant-microbial system, volatile compounds emitted by certain soil bacteria can inhibit fungal plant pathogens and promote plant growth.
- **Conclusion:** Identifying these key metabolites can lead to new strategies for improving crop production.

### P-463: Metabolomics Reveals Key Chemical Responses and Susceptibilities in Commercial Forest Species to Infestation by Pest Insects Introduced in Chile

**Presenting Author:** Andy Pérez, Department of Instrumental Analysis, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepcion, Chile

**Co-Authors:** Valentina Campos, Sebastián Riquelme, Claudia Mardones, Rosa Alzamora, Rafael Rubilar

**Abstract:**

The forest industry is vital to the Chilean economy, with Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus (mainly E. globulus and E. nitens) being the preferred species. These species face biotic stressors, such as the woodwasp Sirex noctilio and the eucalyptus defoliator Gonipterus platensis. This study used LC-MS-based metabolomics to distinguish defensive or resistance mechanisms against these pests.

- **Methods:** LC-MS analysis was performed on P. radiata wood, bark, and needles from resistant and susceptible trees.
- **Results:** Down-regulation of taxifolin (dihydroquercetin) and citric acid derivatives in the bark of infested trees was significant. Stilbenoids and gallate-derived metabolites in the leaves of less susceptible E. nitens were suggested to exert a feeding deterrent effect.
- **Conclusion:** These results may contribute to uncovering genetic bases for resistance mechanisms that could be harnessed in breeding programs.
