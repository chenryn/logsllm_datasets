Thai Herbal Sahatsatara Formula (STF) is in the Thailand National List of Herbal Medicinal Products for the relief of muscle pain and numbness on 
hands and feet STF contains 21 herbal ingredients The previous study showed that STF reduced pain in patients with low back pain (LBP) However, 
there are no identifying of related chemical compounds The aim of this study is to investigate metabolites profiling, using liquid chromatography-
time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS), in patients with non-specific acute LBP after STF administration Twenty-eight patients were received 
STF 1,350 mg, 3 times daily, for 7 days Plasma samples were collected before STF administration on day 0, and after STF administration on day 1, 
4 and 7 The results showed different metabolomics profile at day 1 and 4 when compared to day 0 Interestingly, the pattern of the chemical profile 
was closely when compared at day 7 to day 0 The most identified compounds were lipids such as lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), palmitoleic 
acid, linoleate, myristic acid suggesting anti-inflammatory action of STF Further study on the metabolomics-phenomics relationship will help to 
understand the mechanism of action of STF

Metabolomics as tool to study the role of semiochemicals in biotic plant interactions
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Roland Mumm, Wageningen Plant Research, Bioscience, Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Ric C.H. de Vos, Robert D. Hall
In nature, plants are surrounded by a huge diversity of organisms with which they form a complex network of antagonistic (eg, pests and 
pathogens) and mutualistic (eg, pollinators, beneficial microbes) interactions These interactions are tuned by an intense chemical communication 
between the different players mediated by numerous volatile and non-volatile compounds, so called semiochemicals In this presentation we will 
give examples of metabolomics approaches as a tool in research towards the role of different types of semiochemicals involved in the chemical 
communication of plants, microorganisms and insects We have applied untargeted comprehensive GC-MS and LC-MS profiling for volatile and non-
volatile metabolites to elucidate which semiochemicals are important for attracting and repelling of insect pest in contrasting crop species including 
cabbage, hop, and bean species In bioassays and field trials we show that compounds that are also valued for their flavour properties likely also 
play a role in the plant resistance/susceptibility against enemies In a plant microbial system we show that volatile compounds emitted by certain 
soil bacteria can have inhibitory effects on the growth of fungal plant pathogens but in turn can also promote the growth of the plant Once we have 
identified these key metabolites we can exploit them in follow up research focused upon developing new strategies for improving crop production

Metabolomic Approaches for the Identification of Flavonoids Associated with Weed Suppression in Sele
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sajid Latif, Charles Sturt University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Saliya Gurusinghe, Paul A. Weston, Jane C. Quinn, Leslie A Weston
Incorporation of competitive pasture legumes in conservation agricultural systems provides a non-chemical alternative towards integrated and 
sustainable weed management strategies While the in-field weed suppressive potential of annual pasture legumes has been previously described, 
the mechanism of interference with weeds has not been clearly elucidated We therefore aimed to delineate the role of secondary metabolites present 
in pasture legumes through a series of studies to: 1) characterize key metabolites present in plant tissues, and the rhizosphere and 2) correlate their 
presence with weed suppressive properties In vitro experimentations were conducted to assess the phytotoxic potential of selected annual pasture 
legumes and targeted and non-targeted metabolic profiling was performed to evaluate the abundance of key metabolites using UHPLC QTOF-MS 
Methanolic extracts and dried residues of Biserrula pelecinus L and Ornithopus compressus L, but not Trifolium vesiculosum Savi, exhibited marked 
phytotoxicity in a series of laboratory experiments Metabolic profiling revealed that both foliar tissues and rhizosphere soils of annual pasture 
legumes possessed a high abundance of various flavonoids and their precursors Chemometric analyses suggested a clear association of quercetin, 
isoquercetin, kaempferol, and kaempferol-7-O-glucoside with phytotoxicity and weed suppression under field conditions Specifically, the abundance of 
quercetin and kaempferol was significantly higher in soils collected from established stands of biserrula and yellow serradella in contrast to arrowleaf, 
gland and subterranean clover Both field and laboratory experimentation provided evidence for the role of annual legume-produced flavonoids in 
weed suppression in southern Australia and further insight into their localization and release in the soil rhizosphere

Phytochemicals responsible for susceptibility to pest insects in forest species revealed by LC-MS based metabolomics approach
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jasna Valentina Campos, University of Concepcion, Chile
CO-AUTHORS: Sebastián Riquelme, Rosa Alzamora, Claudia Mardones, Rafael Rubilar, Andy J. Pérez.
The forest industry is of great importance for the Chilean economy and the Eucalyptus plantations corresponds to 35% of total planted surface The 
two most preferred species by the foresters are E globulus and E nitens, but these trees face large biotic stressors Such is the case of Gonipterus 
platensis Marelli (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) commonly known as Eucalyptus weevil, which is a defoliator insect native from southeastern Australia 
that feed on growing Eucalyptus foliage The most susceptible species to this pest in Chile is E camaldulensis and E globulus, whereas E nitens 
has been reported for its ability to resist or avoid the attack, fact that has also been confirmed by our research group in the field In the present work 
a new approach based on non-targeted reverse phase LC-MS metabolomics analysis was performed to establish a qualitative difference between 
metabolomes of E globulus and E nitens leaves, species with different susceptibility to the insect attack The multivariate principal component 
analysis (PCA) and partial lest-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed to investigate the overall variation in the metabolome The 
PLS-DA analysis showed the specific metabolites for each species where the most contributor to this separation highly correlated to E nitens were 
STILBENOIDS and GALLATE derived compounds that explained the chemical difference with E globulus, these secondary non-volatile metabolites 
can satisfactorily explain most of the variation between both species, consider them as potential biomarkers and playing an important role for the 
host selection by insect

Metabolic profiling approach to understand the immune defense activity in date palm under biotic stress
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Resna Nishad, Qatar University, Qatar
CO-AUTHORS: Talaat Ahmed
The most devastating diseases of date palm are results of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, Ceratocystis radicicola is one among them Cradicicola 
is found all over Arabian Peninsula, it is a causative agent of black scorch, root rot, trunk rot and rhizosis Induced biosynthesis of primary and 
secondary metabolite is a plant basal immunity mechanism against fungal pathogen, thus in the current study we followed metabolic approaches to 
study the interaction between date palm and pathogenic fungi As metabolite production and extraction is more convenient in suspension culture 
than the whole living plant, we established suitable date palm suspension culture to study the host-pathogen interaction In order to understand 
whether same or distinct host defense pathway is operating in both in vitro as well as in planta system we compared the metabolic changes in callus 
and in planta after exposing plant cell to Cradicicola elicitor and mycelia Fatty acid profiling was analyzed in response to fungal elicitor and mycelia 
in callus and leaf respectively by using GC-MS The fatty acid production was different in callus from the leaf thus the response towards biotic stress 
was entirely different in both systems Even though the response were different, the fatty acid synthetic pathway found to be leading SA mediated 
and JA mediated immune responses It concludes that date palm suspension system can use for pant-microbe interaction study This work was 
made possible by GSRA grant GSRA2-1-0608-14021 from the Qatar national research fund (a member of Qatar foundation)

In-depth metabolomic profiling reveals genome plasticity in the plant pathogen Fusarium poae
PRESENTING AUTHOR: David Overy, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Tom Witte, Amanda Sproule, Anne Hermans, Anne Johnston, Allen Xue, Linda Harris
Fusarium poae (Peck) Wollenweber is cosmopolitan, occurring on a range of hosts and associated with Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) in cereals 
European and Asian isolates of F poae have been reported to produce type A and type B trichothecenes as well as beauvericin, cyclonerodiol, 
and enniatins, but little is known about the mycotoxigenic potential of Canadian isolates Historically, mycotoxin production associated with F 
poae is quite variable Several researchers hypothesize that the variation in mycotoxin expression observed in F poae results from the presence 
of supernumerary chromosomes and the abundance of transposable elements (TEs) within its genome Supernumerary chromosomes act as 
evolutionary cradles for pathogen virulence factors and transposon facilitated translocations into core chromosomes can accelerate genome 
evolution and therefore present a considerable challenge towards a durable disease management strategy In depth metabolomic profiling and 
genome sequencing was carried out on 46 monosporic Canadian F poae isolates demonstrating a degree of chemotypic diversity Metabolomic 
profiling revealed consistent production of multiple “core genome” associated metabolites including the emerging mycotoxins diacetoxyscirpenol 
and beauvericin Of particular interest, strain specific production of new mycotoxins were also observed and linked with horizontal gene transfer 
through supernumerary insertions into the F poae genome

An untargeted lipidomics MS-based approach to identify bioactive compounds of different yeast species associated to 
Drosophila suzukii
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Flavia Bianchi, Laimburg Research Centre, Italy
CO-AUTHORS: Urban Spitaler, Silvia Schmidt, Peter Robatscher, Daniela Eisenstecken
The spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (D suzukii) is an invasive vinegar fly native to Southern Asia, that has spread across USA and Europe, 
causing considerable economic damage in agriculture to a wide variety of fruits Previous studies revealed that yeasts are attractive to D suzukii, and 
they can influence the fitness of many Drosophila species being a food source, and favouring larval development, fecundity and oviposition Lipids 
play a fundamental role in the diet of Drosophila, since they are the major energy storage molecules in cells, and necessary for egg production Insect 
fat body contributes to the development, metamorphosis, and reproduction of the flies In nature, Drosophila feeds on yeast growing on fruit, and both 
yeasts and plants constitute a lipid source Yeast food is enriched in phosphatidylinositols, in contrast, plant food contains mostly triacylglycerols, 
and a more heterogeneous composition of phospholipid classes Within the project DROMYTAL the metabolic profile of eight selected yeast species 
putatively associated to D suzukii have been explored to develop a lure, based on the association of attractant and phagostimulant yeasts and an 
insecticide Intracellular non-polar metabolites have been extracted after inoculation in liquid media (potato dextrose broth) for 30 hours An untargeted 
approach in reversed-phase liquid chromatography–quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RPLC-QTOFMS) was used to detect diverse 
compound classes Clear differences could be found among yeast species Overall, about 90 distinct intracellular lipids have been annotated and/or 
identified, for further investigating which compounds play a bioactive role for the fitness of the insect

Metabolomics reveals key chemical responses and susceptibilities in commercial forest species to infestation by pest insects 
introduced in Chile
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Andy Pérez, Department of Instrumental Analysis, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepcion, Chile
CO-AUTHORS: Valentina Campos, Sebastián Riquelme, Claudia Mardones, Rosa Alzamora, Rafael Rubilar
Forest industry is of great importance for the Chilean economy, with annual exports over US$ 5000 million since 2011 and planted surface 
around 24 million ha Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus (mainly E globulus and E nitens) are the preferred species by forest companies, covering 
the largest plantation area in Chile However, P radiata as Eucalyptus species currently face biotic stressors that significantly threaten profits of 
this economic activity One of these is the woodwasp Sirex noctilio F, considered as the most damaging invasive pest in Southern Hemisphere 
Pinus plantations, and the eucalyptus defoliator, Gonipterus platensis M These are insects under official control in Chile declared by the Chilean 
Livestock and Agricultural Service (SAG) Here, we describe the LC-MS based metabolomics analysis on P radiata wood, bark and needles from 
resistance and susceptible trees, aimed to distinguish defensive or resistance mechanisms against S noctilio Among revealed results, down-
regulation for biosynthesis of taxifolin (dihydroquercetin) and derived of citric acid in the bark of infested trees, seems to be the most significant 
Similarly, metabolites responsible for the different susceptibility between E globulus and E nitens to the defoliator G platensis were distinguished 
A combination of stibenoids and gallate derived metabolites present in the leaves of the less susceptible species was suggested as potentially 
exerting a feeding deterrent effect, opening a new possibility for the environmental friendly control of this pest These results may contribute to 
uncover genetic basis for resistance mechanisms that could be harnessed in a resistance breeding program of such species

Metabolomics profiling of meconium using LC/HRMS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nihel BEKHTI, UMR CEA-INRA, France
CO-AUTHORS: Florence Castelli, Estelle Paris, Blanche Guillon, Christophe Junot, François Fenaille, Karine Adel-Patient
Some factors of exposure in pregnant women such as diet, living area, drugs are simultaneously transferred to the fetus and may affect its 
maturation and later, the child health development These in utero transmissions could be observed through meconium analysis Actually, meconium 
is the earliest newborn stools, it begins forming from the second month of pregnancy and accumulate until birth This matrix has the advantage 
to integrate a large period of exposure In the literature, meconium composition has been mostly studied using targeted methods focusing on a 
given family of compounds (ex pesticides, illicit drugs or commonly prescribed medicines) In this work, we aim to provide an individual mapping 
of the meconium composition, using non-targeted metabolomics analysis We first developed and optimized the analysis workflow thanks to two 
meconium samples collected days 1 and 2 post-partum High detection sensitivity and method robustness have been reached thanks to thoroughly 
optimized sample preparation, involving a pre-step of freeze-drying followed by a solvent-assisted metabolic extraction This step is monitored by 
a liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS) analysis, using a Q-Exactive instrument Raw data were further 
processed using the Workflow4Metabolomics infrastructure We successfully annotated up to 200 metabolites with a high level of identification, 
which represents the most exhaustive description of human meconium to date This workflow is now being applied to a meconium cohort collected 
from 11 children, from birth to days 2-3 post-partum This analysis will allow to evaluate the meconium composition evolution, and to assess inter-
individual variability

Mobility Enabled LC/MS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Robert Plumb, Imperial College London, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Robert Plumb, Adam King
As global life-styles change we are seeing increasing cases of obesity, diabetes, and mental health issues This not only affects a person’s quality 
of life but also places increased strain on the health-care systems to provide the right treatment whilst managing costs closely Metabolic Profiling 
of large cohorts offers a valuable and unique insight into the underlying biochemistry of diseases as well as the patient’s individual biochemistry 
“phenotype’, diet, health status, age and stress To deliver this information the analytical data generated in processed via a variety of chemometric 
modelling and analysis methodologies to deliver the relevant biochemical information These chemometric platforms employed vary from simple 
multivariant analysis to highly complex model based analysis and is presented in a format ready for interpretation by medics On of the major 
challenges is the identification of putitive biomarkers Recent advancements in ion mobility MS and in-silico CCS prediction offers the opportunity 
to revolutionize biomarker identification both in terms of speed and accuracy In this presentation we will discuss the development of rapid 
exploratory LC/IMS/MS analytical platforms as well as a detailed discussion on the workflow, validation, reporting and decision-making process 
The presentation will cover the development and validation of the “discovery’ screening methods for polar, non-polar metabolites using LC/MS 
methodology, as well as describe the use of Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry to enhance data quality

Using the Retention Time Prediction Method for Choline Plasmalogens Identification by  
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dave Lee, National Taiwan University, Taiwan
CO-AUTHORS: Sung-Chun Tang, Ching-Hua Kuo
Choline plasmalogens (P-PC) are special subclass of phosphatidylcholine (PC) which compose of a vinyl-ester bond at the sn-1 position of the 
glycerol backbone Abnormal P-PC levels have been found associated with many diseases, such as neurological disorders and oxidative stress 
Previous MS methods showed limitations on distinguishing P-PC and alkyl-PC (O-PC), as these PC subclasses share the same molecular formula 
and MS2 fragment ions Herein, we developed a UHPLC-QTOF-MS method combined with the dynamic MRM (dMRM) method by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/
MS for measuring PC molecule species To identify P-PC and O-PC, we developed a retention time (RT) prediction method by establishing the linear 
correlation between prediction parameters considering the XlogP values and RT The RT prediction method was applied to predicted 205 of the 
plasma PCs, including 33 P-PC and 51 O-PC, and over 60% of the identified PCs showed less than 03 minutes errors compared to experimental 
RT values confirmed by the fragmentation information This proposed method was applied to study oxygen-glucose deprived (OGD) induced 
neuron injury The results revealed PC(O-16:1/20:3) and PC(P-16:0/20:3) with identical formula, but different in the sn-1 structure were regulated in 
a distinct direction after OGD treatment With the power of the RT prediction method to provide more structure information for PCs especially on 
P-PC and O-PC, the biological functions of these PCs could be uncovered It is anticipated to apply this RT prediction method to explain unknown 
physiological mechanisms involving PC dysregulation and discover PCs as disease markers

MetaboShiny - identify each mass, en masse
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Joanna Wolthuis, UMC Utrecht, Netherlands
Analyzing untargeted mass spectrometry data involves investigating hundreds to thousands of metabolite peaks This is a major challenge in direct 
infusion, where samples are introduced into the spectrometer with no column beforehand Various analytical tools have been created to stand up to 
this challenge, but are often limited in identifying compounds To analyze untargeted metabolomics data, one needs to match molecular candidates 
to many mass/change (m/z) values To streamline this process we are developing the R tool MetaboShiny It simplifies discovering m/z of interest 
from a pool of m/z values in an attractive and interactive interface MetaboShiny features interactive plots and tables, with a tight integration of a fast 
SQLITE database backend Available databases (16 total) include the HMDB, ChEBI, and KEGG MetaboShiny generates adduct and isotope variants 
based on user preference Altogether, the databases encompass over 100 million m/z values MetaboShiny does normalization and statistics with 
the MetaboAnalystR package, such as T-tests, PCA, PLS-DA and fold-change analysis, to heatmaps and over 40 machine learning methods Venn 
diagrams summarize results, identifying metabolites that are significant in multiple analyses Users click through results and link significant m/z values 
to databases MetaboShiny displays compound descriptors and PubMed abstract search results to enhance exploration If no matches are found, 
MetaboShiny predicts a molecular formula from the m/z value, and searches PubChem for known compounds matching the predicted formula We are 
implementing network/pathway-based and cheminformatics-based compound identification and neural network adduct formation prediction

Using Multi-omics Approaches to Maximize Beef Production
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Aidin Foroutan, Department of Agricultural Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Aidin Foroutan, Carolyn Fitzsimmons, Leluo Guan, Rupasri Mandal, David S. Wishart
Over 40% of the cost of beef production is impacted by feed efficiency Reproductive performance of beef cattle also has a significant impact on the 
cost of production Hence, decreasing the cost of production along with improving carcass yield and quality will benefit the beef industry Maximizing 
production efficiency of beef cattle requires not only genetic selection to maximize feeding efficiency (ie residual feed intake - RFI) but also adequate 
nutrition throughout all stages of growth and development - even during gestation Nutrient restriction during gestation has been shown to negatively 
affect post-natal growth and development as well as fertility of the offspring This, when combined with RFI, may affect progeny traits Therefore, we 
decided to conduct a comprehensive multi-omics study to investigate the impacts of pre-natal nutrition and RFI selection on the metabolism and 
fertility parameters in Angus bulls Four different tissues (Longissimus thoracis muscle, semimembranosus muscle, liver, testis) and three biofluids 
(serum, semen, rumen content) were analyzed Epigenetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics experiments identified 891, 4, and 47 candidate 
biomarkers, respectively, that were associated with RFI as well as pathways such as cellular growth and proliferation, embryonic development, organ 
morphology, and connective tissue development These markers have been integrated through a variety of novel bioinformatic techniques to reveal 
key biological pathways affected by RFI selection and pre-natal nutrition in Angus bulls If these gene/metabolite biomarkers and corresponding 
pathways are validated in a larger animal population, they could potentially be used in breeding programs to select for superior animals

Automated analysis of large-scale NMR data generates metabolomic signatures and links them to candidate compounds

Applying genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to metabolomics associates metabolites with genotypic variants We observed that the 
effect of a genetic variant on the concentration of a metabolite often translates into associations with all or many features of the metabolite NMR 
spectrum The set of association scores with all measured features provides a pseudospectrum across the full range of ppm covered by 1H NMR 
spectra The challenge is then to identify the metabolite underlying the most significant associations To this end we developed the analysis 
tool metabomatching, which takes as input a pseudospectrum and a collection of reference spectra for individual metabolites such as found in 
HMDB We first demonstrate that metabomatching works well to prioritize the most likely metabolite candidates for pseudospectra derived from 
metabolic feature association with genotypes (Rueedi et al PLoS Genetics 2014 and PLoS Computational Biology, 2017) Next we show that the 
metabomatching methodology can also be used for identifying metabolites that vary across large collection of samples without the need for any 
external variables associated with this variation We investigate three methods that identify co-varying spectral features within large-scale NMR 
data Specifically, we compare Principal Component Analysis, the Iterative Signature Algorithm and averaging correlation profiles inspired by the 
STOCSY approach For each method, we devise a principled way for processing their output into pseudospectra We then evaluate systematically in 
which cases metabomatching provides strong evidence for matching metabolites, and assess to what extent the three methods provide consistent 
or complementary output
