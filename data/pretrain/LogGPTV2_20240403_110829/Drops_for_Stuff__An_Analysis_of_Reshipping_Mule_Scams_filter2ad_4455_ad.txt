need to compromise more credentials.
The unwitting drops are victims too. The miscreants often do not pay
the promised salary or commission and they abuse the drops’ personal
information in other frauds and open bank accounts in the victims’
names (see Section 5.3). While being victims of the scam, the drops
also face the risk of becoming a target in lawsuits for assisting in fraud.
Finally, the destination countries for the goods lose tax income and
customs duty as the packages are not properly declared by the criminals.
5.2.2 Loss Estimate and Damages
Site-Speciﬁc Revenue Estimate. First, we investigate the number
of illicit purchases and measure the ﬁnancial loss incurred by single
reshipping scam operations. The log data from four reshipping scams
(see Table 2) includes the timestamps of purchases and the accumu-
lated indexes of the packages (except for SHIPPING-F, whose index
starts at 1). Figure 7 shows in more detail how the reshipping scams
evolve over time. The x-axis indicates the relative time starting at the
beginning of our observation periods, and the y-axis shows the package
indices. We ﬁt the package counts via least squares linear regression.
Furthermore, when we project the dates back to when the package
index was 0 for site SHIPPING-A and SHIPPING-C, these inferred
dates match the domain registration dates of the sites, which supports
the correctness of our model. The number of packages that are shipped
in a speciﬁc time period through each reshipping scam appears to not
increase for SHIPPING-A and SHIPPING-F (linear regression ﬁts all
recordings well). However, for SHIPPING-C, the operation appears
to gain momentum as the rate of shipped packages toward the end of
our dataset signiﬁcantly outperforms the linear regression. In contrast,
SHIPPING-B, seems to have reached its end of life at slightly over a
total of 2,000 packages.
We use this model to estimate how many illicit purchases are being
made by cybercriminals for a given period. Thus, in a one year pe-
riod we estimate 1,911 packages being shipped through SHIPPING-A,
3,541 through SHIPPING-B, 9,009 through SHIPPING-C, and 6,673
through SHIPPING-F respectively. The annual package number from
a reshipping scam site is typically in the magnitude of 1,000–10,000,
while other highly-productive reshipping operations reportedly man-
age close to 50,000 packages in a single year. Note that, the majority of
stuffers, around 80%–90%, have shipped less than 60 packages during
our observation. However, a small number of stuffers ordered up to
300 packages (see Figure 5(a)).
If we further correlate the product ratios (see Figure 4) and the aver-
age prices of each category (see Table 3) with the estimated number of

The white circles on the bottom indicate drops, and the black circles on
the left represent stuffers. The elements on one dimension is ordered

inafter, we identify the victims in reshipping scams, and we quantify
their ﬁnancial loss.
5.2.1 Victims
First, investigations by federal law enforcement conﬁrmed that the
cardholders in reshipping scams were the victims from data breaches
or information theft. The problem is twofold. On the one hand, credit
cards are generally insured and the cardholder rarely suffers ﬁnancial
loss. On the other hand, if cybercriminals steal a debit card (which,
in the US, uses the same payment processing techniques as a credit
card, and can often be used interchangeably) then the cardholder is not
necessarily insured and often unable to dispute the transaction, leaving
him alone with the ﬁnancial loss the criminals incurred. In case of a
compromised credit card, then the loss is distributed over different
parties. First, the cardholder needs to spend time and effort to ﬁght
the fraudulent transaction. Second, the bank needs to issue and send a
new credit card to the cardholder. Third, the merchant has to cover the
loss of the merchandise and an additional chargeback, which can range
up to 100 US dollars. Additionally, due to consumer protection against
credit card fraud, retailers are usually held liable for the illicit purchases
and have to reimburse the cardholder for all incurred charges. At this
point, it is often too late for the retailer to retrieve the merchandise
because it has been shipped out to the drop and might have already been
reshipped. Furthermore, besides the chargeback fee, retailers have
paid (directly or indirectly through the chargeback) for shipping to the

data from SHIPPING-C’s reshipping logs. Overall, we see a total of
5,505 packages with a legitimate item value (we remove 491 packages
from the data for which the item’s value is not provided or for which
an obviously fake value is given; we only exclude items with item
value less or equal to 1 US dollar). For these 5,505 packages, a total
of 3,926 cardholders were defrauded with the sum of all values being
4,542,104.53 US dollars. In turn, this results in an average damage
per cardholder of 4,542,104.53
= 1, 156.93 US dollars.
Finally, by multiplying the average loss per cardholder with the es-
timated overall number of cardholders, we can estimate that the overall
reshipping scam revenue is around 1.8 billion US dollars per year.

purchases, then we can estimate the annual illicit revenue of a single re-
shipping scam site to range from 1.8 million US dollars (SHIPPING-A)
to over 7.3 million US dollars (SHIPPING-C). Note that, for simplicity
and to be conservative, we do not include the potential product markup
(see Section 5.1.1) in foreign countries in our revenue calculation.
Overall Financial Loss. In addition to the per-site revenue, we es-
timate the overall ﬁnancial loss incurred by reshipping mule scams
by estimating the number of cardholder victims and the damage per
cardholder. For an accurate estimate, we ﬁrst infer the number of card-
holder victims for all reshipping scams by using a mark and recapture
(capture-recapture) approach, which is a technique used to estimate
a population’s size in ecology and epidemiology [11]. Following, we
use the Lincoln index [12]. The idea of a capture-recapture analysis
is to repeatedly sample from the population to estimate its size. First,
we take a sample S1, mark, and then release it back into the population.
We then take a second sample S2 and examine the marked members
of S2, which is the intersection of S1 and S2. We then estimate the
|S1|×|S2|
|S1∩S2| . For a perfectly accurate capture-recapture
population P =
model some assumptions are crucial, e.g., the population is homo-
geneous and closed (i.e., no new entries are allowed). Some of the
assumptions do not necessarily hold for our analysis, however, they
have likely only negligible impact because of the signiﬁcant time-wise
overlap (see Table 2) and the way that credit card information is stolen
(see Section 1). For example, in our case, new cardholders might be
defrauded and involved in the scam, possibly reducing accuracy of
the estimate slightly. However, we aim to only use the estimate for an
initial approximation of the population size of the abused cardholders.
For our population estimate we consider two fraud cases as referring
to the same credit card or account if the owners’ names are identical
and the purchases from different reshipping scam sites occur close
in time. In our analysis, we use a threshold of one month since it is
very likely that the fraud is detected within one month, either through
automatic means or by verifying the account statement. If the time dif-
ference between two cases exceeds one month, it is likely that separate
cardholder victims have the same name, or that the same victim has had
his replacement credit card compromised once again. We use the two
sites in our data set with most defrauded cardholders: SHIPPING-A
and SHIPPING-C. They overlap for seven months, during which 761
cardholders were defrauded by stuffers using SHIPPING-A and 3,569
were defrauded by stuffers using SHIPPING-C. Three cardholders
appear on both sites during the overlap period. Therefore, the estimated
number of overall cardholders who are victims of reshipping mule
7 ≈ 1, 552, 005. Note that, while
scams per year is 761×3,569
these numbers serve as an estimate, the number of stolen credit card
information and potential victims is multiple magnitudes larger and
our estimate is likely on the conservative side (see Section 1).

Drops are the main labor force in the reshipping scam as they receive
and reship goods for the cybercriminals. In this section, we investigate
the characteristics of drops and the timing patterns when they sign up
and relay packages, and where the drops are located.
5.3.1 Drop Churn / Life Cycle
First, to better understand how and when the criminals utilize the
drops (i.e., to analyze their life cycle), we investigate the signup time
of drops and when they are ﬁrst associated with packages. Figure 8
shows the life cycles of drops in more detail. The x-axis indicates the
relative days, and the y-axis presents the indices of drops observed
from SHIPPING-A. A red circle indicate an assignment event where
a stuffer assigns a reshipping task to a drop, with the size of the circle
being proportional to the number of packages assigned on any given
date. A black line indicates the idle period between the day when a
drop has successfully signed up at the reshipping scam site and the day
of his ﬁrst assignment.
A drop receives packages shortly after he has signed up, usually after
a few days. We observe a clear churn pattern in the drops’ life cycles:
Cybercriminals stop using the drops after around 30 days and start to
employ a new batch of drops. The hypothesis is that the reshipping
sites abandon the drops before the ﬁrst expected paycheck dates. We
examined the message exchanges between the reshipping site operators
and the drops to verify this hypothesis. As a concrete example, on day
two after the drop signed up, the drop sent an email to conﬁrm when he
will receive his ﬁrst paycheck (“I know the pay is only once a month so
when will I receive my ﬁrst check!? ”). In the weeks after, the drop and
the site operator had frequent contact about issues regarding packages
and labels. On day 30, the drop asked again: “Exactly what time will
my check be deposited into my account Monday!?”, to which the site
operator replied that he would receive it: “by the end of Monday”. The
drop then continued to reship packages. On day 35, the drop inquired
again about his payment date (“What time will I be paid!?”). The site
operator then instructed the drop to ship all packages to receive the
check, likely to make sure all merchandise has been shipped. On day
36, we observe that the drop asked again about his payment (“When
will my check be deposited!?”), to which the operator never replied.
We have found multiple other instances in which drops complained
about not receiving compensation and none of the messages in our
data set showed any proof that drops successfully received payments.
Our ﬁndings strongly suggest that the cybercriminals intentionally
make no payment to the drops, which results in fast drop turnover
and requires regular recruitment. Without actually paying mules, the
scammers save money while being able to advertise high salaries
and compensation, which, in turn, attracts more drops. For example,
SHIPPING-A promised drops a monthly salary of 2,500 US dollars.
Overall, the criminals utilize an average drop to reship between
ﬁve (SHIPPING-A) and ﬁfteen (SHIPPING-F) packages, with some
outliers reshipping over 50 packages during their 30-day lifetime
(SHIPPING-F). Figure 5(c) shows the distribution of the counts of pack-
ages delivered to the drops. Interestingly, different sites exhibit differ-

sively within the US for some time. This, in turn, prompted cybercrimi-
nals to adopt the reshipping mule scheme that we analyze in this paper.
In this section, we outline promising ways in which shipping service
companies can aid in combating this monetization technique and help to
reduce the damage done to the businesses involved, by identifying sus-
picious packages before they leave the country. While we discuss these
measures separately, the individual approaches can be combined to pin-
point high-risk packages, which can be inspected by law enforcement.
A successful identiﬁcation of a reshipping-scam-originating pack-
age can soften the blow on victim merchants (the merchandise can be
returned), and stop criminals from proﬁting since they do not receive
the goods that they were planning on selling on the black market. We
argue that the cost of this selective increased screening of suspicious
packages can be covered by the most victimized vendors, since the cost
is likely to be many times smaller than the cost of stolen merchandise.
5.4.1 Access Patterns
One way to detect suspicious packages is by analyzing how, when,
and from where tracking information of possibly-suspicious pack-
ages is accessed at the shipping provider’s or a third-party’s package
tracking website. This information can include data points such as the
browsers’ user-agent of the visitors, their source IP addresses, their
timezones, or their languages. For instance, tracking information for
a package from Walmart to a person living in California will (in most
cases) not be tracked exclusively by someone in Russia. As such, if
a website visitor from a different country is tracking a package more
actively than the actual recipient or sender, then this can be a strong
indicator that the package might be suspicious.
Figure 9: Locations of the drops.
ent trends: SHIPPING-C replaces drops signiﬁcantly more quickly than
SHIPPING-F, while both have about the same number of packages re-
shipped in the same time frame (see Figure 7). For SHIPPING-B, drops
ship at least four packages and half of them ship 14 packages or more.
5.3.2 Geography
Figure 9 shows the distribution of city-level addresses of drops.
In the US, ﬁve states, California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, and New
York, account for 44.33% of the drops. However, only in one of those
states, namely Georgia, the likelihood to encounter a mule at random
among the state population exceeds 0.01%. To measure the likelihood
that a resident of a state is recruited as a mule, henceforth called drop
likelihood, we divide the number of drops in a state (observed in our
data) by the entire population of that state [13]. We summarize our
ﬁndings in Table 5, which shows the rankings of the top 10 states in
terms of drop likelihood (in decreasing order).
Finally, we compare the annual unemployment rates of these states
in 2014 [14] to the federal average. The last column in Table 5 lists the
differences of the state unemployment rates compared to the federal
unemployment rate, where L indicates a higher unemployment rate
in that state and (cid:53) indicates a lower rate. Most states, except Virginia
(rank 10), have unemployment rates close to or above the US average
rate, which could indicate that cybercriminals target unemployed or
underemployed groups to recruit mules.
5.4 Intervention Analysis
All parties who are actively losing money through shipping scams
(see Section 5.2) have a strong incentive to prevent these fraudulent
transactions. In this spirit, many merchants stopped shipping to high-
risk countries, such as Russia, and have been shipping goods exclu-
