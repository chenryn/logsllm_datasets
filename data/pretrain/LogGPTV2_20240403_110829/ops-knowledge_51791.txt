User: How to use Git for development team collaboration and code version management?
Assistant: Git is a decentralized version control system that helps teams collaborate and manage code versions. The following are the steps to use git: 1. Create a Git warehouse: use the git init command to create a new Git warehouse or use the git clone command to copy an existing warehouse to the local. 2. Create a branch: use the git branch command to create a new branch, and use the git checkout command to switch the code to the new branch. 3. Develop and modify code: develop and modify code on the branch. Use the git add command to add the code to the local warehouse, and use the git commit command to submit the code to the local branch. 4. Merge code: Use the git merge command to merge the modified code into the main branch. 5. Resolve code conflicts: Conflicts may occur when merging code. In this case, use git status and git diff commands to view conflicting files and manually resolve conflicts. 6. Pull and push code: Use the git pull command to get the latest code, and use the git push command to push the code to the remote Git warehouse. 7. Manage branches: Use the git branch command to view and manipulate branches, such as merging branches or deleting branches. Through Git, team members can collaborate on development, manage code versions, and resolve code conflicts, thereby effectively improving code quality and reducing development costs.
