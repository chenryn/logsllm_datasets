#### Issue Description
This isn't a challenge, it is just the overview/instruction page for basic-
algorithm-scripting. It loads page 1/4 but the "Go to my next step" button is
broken so you cannot navigate to pages 2, 3, and 4. You have to just skip to
the first challenge. That means you don't get that satisfying green checkbox
on the map.
Tested with Chrome and IE
