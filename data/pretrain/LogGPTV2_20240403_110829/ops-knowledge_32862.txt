User: I'm wondering if there's any way to connect SFTP server with Windows' Command Prompt, by only executing batch file.
Do I need to install additional software? which software?
The purpose is to do pretty basic file operations (upload, delete, rename) on remote SFTP server by executing a batch file.
And by the way, I have heard about python's Fabric library, and I wonder whether it's better solution than the batch script for the mentioned basic file operations?
Thanks a lot!
Assistant: The built in FTP command doesn't have a facility for security. You can use winscp, an open source free SFTP client and FTP client for Windows.
