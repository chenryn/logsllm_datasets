User: I am running on Windows 8 and I was recently uploading an application using the standard Google App Engine launcher but it froze mid way and when I closed it and reopened it and tried to upload again it would say a transaction is already in progress for this application and that I would need to rollback the application using appcfg.py.
I looked all over the internet and I understand what to execute, however I don't know how/where.
I tried doing it in the standard Windows command prompt but it just opened the appcfg.py file for me, I tried doing it in the python console but it said is not a valid function, I also tried to run the application locally and access the interactive console but it just said the same thing as the python console attempt.
What do I do?
Assistant: In the windows command prompt, reference your python executable:
eg:
[cmd]
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\google_appengine (ie: [GAE dir])
C:\Python27\python.exe appcfg.py rollback [deploy dir]
