**ABSTRACT**

The exponential growth in the generation of multimedia content, particularly videos, has led to a significant demand for scalable and cost-effective storage solutions. Cloud-based media centers offer an attractive option due to their low cost and scalability. However, privacy concerns necessitate the encryption of videos before outsourcing them to the cloud. To address these challenges, we propose a secure architecture for an encrypted cloud media center that incorporates advanced secure deduplication and video coding techniques. Specifically, we utilize Scalable Video Coding (SVC) and introduce a layer-level secure deduplication strategy to ensure compatibility with SVC's internal structure. This approach enables efficient adaptive dissemination of videos to various devices while maintaining strong security. We provide a thorough security analysis and a prototype implementation on the Amazon cloud platform, demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of our system.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The rapid proliferation of multimedia technology and high-definition cameras in mobile devices has led to a surge in the generation of multimedia content, especially videos. These videos dominate network traffic and require substantial storage resources. Public clouds, known for their availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, are increasingly used to host video-based applications. However, user privacy can be compromised if sensitive videos are not properly protected. Current cloud services are vulnerable to security breaches, making it crucial to address privacy concerns in the context of cloud media centers.

One solution is to encrypt videos using secret keys before uploading them to the cloud. While this ensures confidentiality, it hinders the use of deduplication, a key feature for reducing storage and bandwidth redundancy. Convergent encryption (CE), which ensures identical data maps to identical ciphertexts, is one approach but is vulnerable to offline brute-force attacks and operates under a weak security model. Recent designs have improved CE, but their applicability to encrypted cloud media centers remains unexplored.

In practice, an encrypted cloud media center should support adaptive dissemination of videos to various devices and networks. However, encryption can disable this functionality. Generating multiple versions of videos and encrypting each version separately is impractical due to the high bandwidth and storage overhead. Therefore, we aim to develop a system that supports both secure deduplication and efficient adaptive dissemination, leveraging techniques from cryptography and video processing.

Our contributions include:
- A secure system framework for an encrypted cloud media center that supports secure deduplication and protects data confidentiality.
- Utilization of SVC characteristics, including a structure-compatible encryption mechanism and optimized storage for fast retrieval and efficient dissemination.
- An end-to-end implementation deployed on Amazon AWS, with extensive performance evaluations demonstrating the practicality of our system.

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 System Model

Our system involves three entities:
- **Cloud Media Center:** Provides a video hosting platform, storing users' encrypted videos and adaptively distributing them to various devices and networks. It enforces secure client-side deduplication.
- **User:** Uploads encrypted videos to the cloud and may delete local copies. Users can access their own videos, and sharing can be achieved through attribute-based access control.
- **Agency:** Hosted by a third party, facilitates secure deduplication and helps protect video confidentiality against offline brute-force attacks. It assists in duplicate checks and encryption.

### 2.2 Threat Models

We aim to protect the confidentiality of users' videos under a strong security model, considering bounded leakage and protection for both predictable and unpredictable videos. Two types of adversaries are considered:
- **Malicious Outside Adversary:** A user who tries to gain ownership of a target video without compromising the integrity of other users' videos.
- **Honest-but-Curious Inside Adversary:** The cloud or agency, which follows the designated scheme but attempts to infer or extract information about users' videos. We assume no collusion between the cloud and the agency.

## 3. PRELIMINARIES

### 3.1 Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)

An OPRF protocol allows two parties, a sender and a receiver, to securely compute a pseudorandom function (PRF) where the sender holds the secret key and the receiver provides the input. The receiver learns only the output, and the sender learns nothing. Verifiable OPRF schemes allow the receiver to verify the correctness of the computation. We use the RSA-OPRF scheme built on RSA blind signatures as a building block for our system.

### 3.2 Scalable Video Coding (SVC)

SVC uses the concept of layers to embed multiple versions of a video in a single file. A SVC video consists of a base layer and enhancement layers, enabling resolution, quality, and time scalability. Our system focuses on resolution scalability. SVC removes redundancy between different representations, allowing adaptive playback. Storing SVC videos in the cloud enhances storage efficiency and dissemination scalability.
