ABSTRACT
Multimedia contents, especially videos, are being exponen-
tially generated today. Due to the limited local storage,
people are willing to store the videos at the remote cloud
media center for its low cost and scalable storage. How-
ever, videos may have to be encrypted before outsourcing for
privacy concerns. For practical purposes, the cloud media
center should also provide the deduplication functionality to
eliminate the storage and bandwidth redundancy, and adap-
tively disseminate videos to heterogeneous networks and dif-
ferent devices to ensure the quality of service.
In light of
the observations, we present a secure architecture enabling
the encrypted cloud media center. It builds on top of lat-
est advancements on secure deduplication and video coding
techniques, with fully functional system implementations on
encrypted video deduplication and adaptive video dissemi-
nation services. Speciﬁcally, to support eﬃcient adaptive
dissemination, we utilize the scalable video coding (SVC)
techniques and propose a tailored layer-level secure dedupli-
cation strategy to be compatible with the internal structure
of SVC. Accordingly, we adopt a structure-compatible en-
cryption mechanism and optimize the way how encrypted
SVC videos are stored for fast retrieval and eﬃcient dissem-
ination. We thoroughly analyze the security strength of our
system design with strong video protection. Furthermore,
we give a prototype implementation with encrypted end-
to-end deployment on Amazon cloud platform. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the practicality of our system.

INTRODUCTION
With the explosive growth of multimedia technology and
mobile devices with high-deﬁnition cameras, multimedia con-
tents, especially videos, have already dominated the network
traﬃc and demanded a great amount of hardware storage [8].
To handle such a rapidly growing trend, many existing and
emerging applications based on videos are deployed at public
clouds for its well-known advantages, e.g., availability, scala-
bility, and economy [26]. However, the user privacy could be
violated if content-sensitive videos are not protected prop-
erly in such an outsourcing environment [23]. In fact, current
cloud-based data hosting services are shown to be vulnerable
to security breaches. Data disclosure occurs frequently in re-
cent years [15]. Therefore, addressing the privacy concerns
becomes signiﬁcant for building a cloud media center.
A plausible approach is to require each user to encrypt
the videos using her secret key before sending them to pub-
lic clouds. As long as the user’s secret key is protected,
video conﬁdentiality can be guaranteed. But this approach
prevents the cloud media center from supporting dedupli-
cation, a crucial function that can greatly save the network
bandwidth and eliminate the storage redundancy in cloud
services [14]. Identical videos encrypted by diﬀerent users’
secret keys would lead to diﬀerent ciphertexts, making dedu-
plication infeasible.
To support secure deduplication over encrypted videos,
one might consider utilizing convergent encryption (CE) [10],
which encrypts data with a key deterministically derived
from the data itself (e.g., the hash value), so as to ensure the
identical data will map to identical ciphertexts. However,
CE is vulnerable to oﬀ-line brute-force attacks when the
target message space is small or the data is predictable [2].
Besides, CE is under a weak security model, which does
not consider the bounded leakage setting, where a certain
amount of deterministically and eﬃciently extractable in-
formation of the data could be leaked [25]. Although some
recent designs have improved the security of CE [2,14,17,25],
it remains to be fully explored whether they can directly en-
able an encrypted cloud media center, which should simulta-
neously ensure the strong video conﬁdentiality, provide im-
mediate compatibility with the video structure, and deliver
practical video dissemination services.
63In practice, an encrypted cloud media center should be
able to adaptively disseminate videos to heterogeneous net-
works and devices such as PCs, Mobile phones, Tablets
and SmartTVs [12]. However, such adaptive dissemination
might be disabled after encryption. Alternatively, one can
ask each user to ﬁrst generate diﬀerent versions of videos
from the same source, and then send all encrypted versions
to the cloud. Yet, this method will incur a great amount
of bandwidth and storage overhead, and thus increase the
capital of using cloud services. Therefore, how to enable
eﬃcient adaptive video dissemination while supporting se-
cure deduplication over encrypted videos, is the challenge
we aim to tackle in this paper, for which we bring together
techniques from both cryptography and video processing.
We ﬁrst investigate the applicability of secure deduplica-
tion in the encrypted cloud media center and propose a non-
trivial design to strongly protect video conﬁdentiality.
It
takes into consideration the defenses against the adversaries
in the bounded leakage setting, and the adversaries launch-
ing brute-force attacks over predictable videos, respectively.
To support eﬃcient adaptive dissemination, we exploit the
scalable video coding (SVC) techniques [19]. SVC utilizes
the concept of layers and enables multiple versions of the
same video content to be embedded in a single video ﬁle,
which can signiﬁcantly improve the storage eﬃciency and
dissemination scalability [24]. To make secure deduplica-
tion compatible with the structure of SVC, we propose a
layer-level deduplication strategy tailored for SVC videos,
enabling suitable deduplication for encrypted SVC videos.
Besides, we investigate the encryption of SVC videos [20,
22], and adopt a structure-compatible encryption mecha-
nism and optimize the way encrypted SVC videos are stored
for fast retrieval and eﬃcient dissemination. Our thorough
security analysis shows that video conﬁdentiality is strongly
protected in the proposed system design. We give a full im-
plementation of an encrypted end-to-end cloud media center.
which is deployed at Amazon EC2 instances and leverages
Amazon DynamoDB as the video storage backend. Exten-
sive experiments are conducted to justify the practicality of
our system design.
Contributions. Our main contributions are listed below:
• We formulate a secure system framework for the en-
crypted cloud media center. It supports secure dedu-
plication while protecting data conﬁdentiality against
malicious users and untrusted cloud. Building on top
of latest literature on secure deduplication [2, 25], our
framework supports the secure video deduplication in
the bounded leakage setting, and defends the oﬀ-line
brute-force attacks over predictable videos, respectively.
• We leverage the inherent characteristics of SVC videos
in our design. We utilize an encryption mechanism
which is compatible with the underlying SVC struc-
ture, and optimize the way how encrypted SVC videos
are stored for fast retrieval. Meanwhile, the security
of our system is thoroughly analyzed.
• We implement an end-to-end cloud media center sys-
tem with roughly 17,000 lines of codes, which is fully
deployed at Amazon AWS. We evaluate our system via
various performance metrics on SVC videos with sizes
up to 500MB. The results demonstrate the practicality
of our system.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
2.1 System Model
Our system involves three entities: the cloud media center,
the user, and the agency, as illustrated in Figure 1. Their
roles are described below:
• The cloud media center (abbr. cloud) provides a video
hosting platform, which stores users’ encrypted videos
and adaptively distributes them to cater for heteroge-
neous user devices and network bandwidth. It enforces
secure client-side deduplication, i.e., duplicate check is
performed before users upload videos.
• The user outsources her encrypted videos to the cloud,
and possibly deletes the original ones at local. Later,
the user may access her own videos. Video sharing is
not the focus of this paper, although it can be achieved
along with our design through techniques such as the
attribute-based access control [23].
• The agency, hosted by a third party (e.g., a video
service provider), facilitates our system to safeguard
the conﬁdentiality of user videos against oﬀ-line brute-
force attacks. It assists users and cloud to perform the
duplicate check in a controllable fashion, and enables
users to perform the encryption that supports dedu-
plication.
2.2 Threat Models
Our goal is to protect the conﬁdentiality of users’ videos.
We will consider a strong security model for secure dedupli-
cation, i.e., the bounded leakage setting as in [25], where a
certain amount of deterministically and eﬃciently extractable
information about videos could be leaked. We will also be

dictable videos.
Two types of adversaries are considered in our system: (1)
Malicious outside adversary. The outside adversary may re-
fer to a user who might obtain some knowledge (e.g., a hash
value) of a video and try to earn the ownership of the target
video from cloud. We assume that she will not upload a fake
video to compromise the integrity of other users’ videos. (2)
Honest-but-curious inside adversary. The inside adversary
may refer to cloud or the agency. On the one hand, cloud
faithfully follows the designated deduplication scheme, yet
intends to infer users’ encrypted video contents.
It might
also manipulate one user or a number of users to harvest
target video contents. On the other hand, the third-party
agency dutifully executes the assigned functions, but also
tries to extract useful information about users’ videos. In
this paper, we do not consider that cloud modiﬁes or deletes
users’ videos. And we assume that there is no collusion be-
tween cloud and the agency.
3. PRELIMINARIES
3.1 Oblivious Pseudorandom Function
An oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF) protocol en-
ables two parties, say sender S and receiver R, to jointly and
securely compute a pseudo-random function (PRF) fsk(x),
where sk is the secret key of S and the input x is con-
tributed by R. The OPRF protocol enforces that R only
learns the output value fsk(x) and S learns nothing from
the interactive process [11]. Veriﬁable OPRF schemes al-
low R to further verify whether the result fsk(·) is correctly
computed under S ’s secret key sk, via utilizing S ’s corre-
sponding public key pk. Deterministic blind signatures can
be used to build veriﬁable OPRF schemes [7].
In a blind
signature scheme, a user is able to obtain and verify the dig-
ital signature of a message from a signer without revealing
any data information. Meanwhile, the user cannot learn the
signer’s secret key. In this paper, we use the RSA-OPRF
scheme built on RSA blind signatures [4] as a building block
for our proposed system.
3.2 Scalable Video Coding
The SVC technique utilizes the concept of layers and en-
ables multiple versions of the source video content to be em-
bedded in a single ﬁle, i.e., a SVC video [19]. Intuitively, a
SVC video is composed of a base layer, which represents the
basic visual experience, and enhancement layers, which can
improve the video by supplementing the base layer in dif-
ferent scalability dimensions (i.e., time, quality, resolution).
In our system, we are particularly interested in the resolu-
tion scalability as the ﬁrst instantiation. Through employ-
ing various inter-layer prediction methods, SVC removes the
redundancy between diﬀerent representations of the same
video content [18]. It is noted that at the decoder side, a
lower layer must be present if a higher layer exists but not
the other way around. In other words, if the layers of a SVC
video are discarded from the highest layer, the rest of layers
are still decodable. Thus, a user can adaptively enjoy diﬀer-
ent versions of the same video content through a single SVC
video.
Therefore, from the perspective of storage eﬃciency and
dissemination scalability, it is advantageous to store SVC
videos in the cloud media center to cater for heterogeneous
network bandwidth and diﬀerent devices. Without loss of
generality, a SVC video SV with n layers can be denoted as
SV = (m1, m2, . . . , mn), where m1 is the base layer and mi
is the (i − 1)th enhancement layer for i ∈ [2, n] [23].
