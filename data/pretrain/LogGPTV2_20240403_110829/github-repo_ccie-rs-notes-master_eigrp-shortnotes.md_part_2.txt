**Adjacency Process**
|Direction|Packet|State Following|
|---------|------|---------------|
|R1 to R2 | Hello | R2 puts R1 to pending|
|R2 to R1|Hello|R1 puts R2 to Pending (expedited allowing quick discovery)|
|R2 to R1|Null Update with INit, Seq=x|R1 declares Init rx'd from R2|
|R1 to R2|Null update with with Init, Seq=y, Ack=x|Init and Ack rx'd from R1, R2 puts R1 to up|
|R2 to R1|Ack, Ack=y|Ack rx'd from R2, R1 puts R2 to up|
|R1  R2| Database Sync|Uses updates and Acks|
**Pending State**
* Doesn't send/accept EIGRP messages with routing info until connectivity in place
* Packets exchanged unreliable, other than reliable with Init flag
* Null update - no routing info
**show ip eigrp neighbours**
* H (handle) - Internal number assigned to neighbours, independent of addressing
* Address and Interface
* Hold - From value adv'd by neighbour
* Uptime
* SRTT
* RTO
* Q Cnt - Enqueued reliable packets, must be zero in stable network. Non-zero normal during db sync or convergence
* Seq number - Seq number of last reliable packet from neighbour
# Diffusing Update Algorithm
* Convergence algorithm
* Replaces Bellman-Ford algorithm in other DV
* Avoids loops by performing distributed SPF computation
* Maintains freedom from loops during calculation
# Topology Table
Stores routing info
* Prefix of known dests (address and mask)
* FD of network
* Address of neighbouring router that advertised network (with egress int)
* Metrics of networks adv'd by neigh, plus resulting metric of path to dest
* State of dest network
* Other info (flags, type origin etc)
* Populated with connected networks (local or redist'd)
* Also pop'd with contents of Update, Query, Reply, SIA-Query and SIA-Reply
* Neighbour with least cost path to destination AND loop free path chosen from topology table
Networks active or passive
* Passive - Shortest Path found
* Active - Searching for shortest path
Active for query packets being sent out
* Can't modify routing entry while queries still not replies to (i.e. no removing or changing next hop)
* Route loop free in this state
* If neighbour providing least-cost path can't guarantee loop free path, route in active state
**show ip eigrp topology all-links** - All routes, including FC check failures
# Computed, Reported and FDs, and FCs
**RD**
* Best distance of particular neighbour to destination
**CD**
* Total metric to destination via particular neighbour
(CD/RD) in **show ip eigrp topology**
**FD**
* Record of lowest distance known since last active to passive for route
* Not always equal to best CD
* Can only decrease (if CD goes below FD) or remain at current value (if current CD rises but route is passive)
* Never advertised
* Compared with RD, FD has at some point been at a certain value, meaning RD must be lower (nearer to destination)
* Shouldn't be a case if using a path with lower RD than FD that a routing loop forms
If current distance lower, packets never pass back to this router. Any neighbour closer to destination thatn this route has been since last time destination became Passive, cannot form loop. 
RD 
All passing FC are FSs. Least CD to dest are Successors (can be multiple)
# Local and Diffusing Computations in EIGRP
* TC = Distance to network change or new neighbour online for that network
* Detected by receiving Update, Query, SIA-Query or SIA-Reply with info about network
* Also detected by local int metric change
* Neighbour going down processed with CD/RD through neighbour set to inifnity
If new shortest path passes FC, FS, performs following: -
1. FS providing least CD is successor
2. If CD over new Successor < current FD, FD updated to new CD
3. Routing table update
4. If current distance to dest changed, update packet to neighbours
Above is local, info in topology table. Passive state through this.
If no FS after TC, could be a loop. Diffusing computation started: -
1. Route locked, can't be removed or change next hop
2. FD set to current CD through current Successor. If router needs to advertise its distance while in Active state, uses current CD through successor
3. Network placed in Active state, queries sent to neighbours
Queries contain network and routers current CD to it
Each neighbour updates topology table using distance in query, re-evaluates its Successors and FS. After, neighbour till has own FS or Successor with least-cost loop-free path, or needs to change current Successor.
If neighbour still has succesor, reply sent back with current distance. Route doesnt go active on this neighbour. Diff Comp boundary here.
If no successor, diff comp, own queries, own CD through current successor. Query through this part of network.
One destination active, must wait on replies. Once replies received, FC check skipped, and back to passive. FD becomes CD by selected neighbour. If router Active by receiving queries, it replies to queries, with distance it now has. Otherwise only updates
Main info in Update, Query, Reply and both SIAs is senders current distance. Computation started only if this changes things for a neighbour.
During successor failure: -
* When EIGRP detects change, records in topology table, updates RD and CD of neighbour advertising change, or influenced by (link metric)
* Identify least CD through other neighbours (that have updated CDs themselves)
* After least CD through neighbour found, verify neighbour meets FC and is FS. If yes, successor. If not, active.
# DUAL FSM
One passive, four active states
* A0 - Local origin with distance increase
* A1 - Local origin
* A2 - Multiple origins
* A3 - Successor origins
Rules are: -
* Passive if distance change means neighbour providing least CD doesnt meet FC
* If successor query fails to meet FC, enter A3. Queries sent, wait for replies. If no further distance increase while waiting, get last reply, go active. Change FD, choose new S
* If distance change from update, int metric, or neighbour loss, and neighbour distance fails FC, A1. Queries sent. If no distance increase or queries from S, back to passive
* If during A3 or A1, distance increase from something other than successors query, another change occured. As this cant be adv out, other routers may not know. State from A3 to A2, or A1 to A0. When last reply arrives, check least CD passes DC, using FD set when active. If FC passes, passive again. If not, return to previous state, another diff comp
* If during A1 or A0, a query from successor rx'd, another changed occured. State changes to A2, proceeds as above
Query origin flag stores active state
# Stuck in Active
* Single misbehaving router can cause to be SIA, never ending diff comp
 * CPU overload
 * Packet loss
 * Congestion
 * Large topology/complex, lot of prefixes from single node failure
Default active timer is 3 minutes, can be between 1 and 65535, **timers active-time**. If replies not received, router is SIA. Adj torn down to unresponsive neighbours. Diff Comp takes responds to be infinite metric.
SIA-Query and Reply exist to combat above aggressive behaviour
* If neighbour has no response within half of active, SIA-Query sent
* SIA-Reply can say "waiting on replies" or "Done, this is metric"
* Reply send immediately
* Resets active timer
* Three SIA-Qs sent, each after half active. If Comp not finished by end plus one half of active, adj tear down
Two routers can't wait on each others reply. If during active, router gets another query for dest, reply sent back immediately with same distance in own query.
To avoid SIA, limit query propagation depth, and networks dependent on a link (passive int, route filtering, stub etc)
# EIGRP Named Mode
* IOS 15.0(1)M
* Old method is classic/as mode
* Named mode preferred
* Features go into named mode now
* Anything not in config mode ignored if named mode instance used
Three blocks
* AF section - Specifics AF for this EIGRP instance (ASN in here)
* Per-AF interface - Located inside AF, per interface or sub interface. Can set default settings. Optional section
* Per-af-topology - Multi-Topology-Routing, always present even if no support for MTR

# Additional and Advanced EIGRP features
## Router ID
* 4-byte
* Represents instance
* Each AF own router-id
* Multiple processes and AF families can use same RID
* Was used to prevent loops in redistribution (identified originating router)
* Now also includes internal routes
* **eigrp router-id**
 * If not set, highest IP of non-shut loopback
 * Highest ip on non-shut ints
* Not changed until EIGRP processed removed, RID configured or config'd RID removed
* Not allowed: 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255
* RID change drops neighbours
* Only message if two routers with same RID, "Ignore Route, dup routerid" in **showe eigrp address-family ipv4 events**
* Seen in **show eigrp protocols** and **show ip protocols**
## Unequal cost load balancing
* Must be FS for present for loop free paths
* Paths through FS can be installed along with best
* **variance** command, says how many times worse than best path FS can be
* CD via successor < CD via Feasible Successor < V x CD successor
* If it does, will be installed. V of 1 means none
* Traffic amount is Highest Installed Metric / Path Metric
* Unequal cost paths installed into routing table count towards max parallel paths to destination, **maximum-paths**
## Add-Path
* Allows hub to advertise multiple equal-cost routes to destination
* Might require max paths command
* Split horizon must be disabled on tunnel
* Variance must be set to 1
* No **next-hop-self**, original NH needed
* **no-ecmp-mode** available on above
 * Above deactivates internal optimization
 * Walks over all equal-cost paths to dest in topology table
 * Any of these routes successors should be reachable over interface on which route is going to be readv
