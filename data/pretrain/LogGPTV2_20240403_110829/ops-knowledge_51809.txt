User: Tornado is a webserver + framework like Django but for real-time features.
On my server I don't have a python module or wsgi module so I thought 
CGI. 
Is there a way to get Tornado ( or Django ) works by using CGI folder ? 
If yes, Could you explain me how do I do that ?
Assistant: Main feature of Tornado is that it is high performance web-server written in Python, for creating web applications using Python programming language.
Running Tornado as CGI application negates the very reason it exists, because running CGI scripts is expensive in terms of performance, and most probably there is no way to run Tornado as CGI script.
