Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) that can be used to in-
tegrate services within and across enterprises. As might be
expected given the difference between scientiﬁc and enter-
prise applications, there are any number of technical issues
that must be addressed to accomplish this goal.
This panel will focus on one particular challenge associ-
ated with Grid computing, that of ensuring dependable op-
eration of Grid computations. Dependability in this context
encompasses a broad collection of possible attributes, in-
cluding availability, reliability, security, and timely execu-
tion. Among the possible topics for discussion are different
dependability requirements of current versus envisioned ap-
plication scenarios, technical barriers to achieving depend-
ability in both contexts, and architectural issues related to
providing appropriate support in software platforms such as
OGSA. The overall goal is to bring together the perspectives
of individuals working in different communities to identify
issues and challenges that remain to be solved to make de-
pendable Grid computing a reality.

Overview
For over a decade, researchers involved with scientiﬁc
computing have been investigating technologies that allow
advanced scientiﬁc applications to exploit resources associ-
ated with machines connected by wide-area networks across
large geographical distances. Originally referred to as meta-
computing or heterogenous computing, Grid computing is
currently the most common term used to describe this type
of distributed computing model. Generally speaking, Grid
computing emphasizes large scale resource sharing—not
only computational cycles, but also software and data—
across administrative domains in a ﬂexible, secure, and co-
ordinated fashion. A number of software platforms have
been developed that address all or subsets of the challenges
associated with Grid computing, including Condor, the En-
tropia platform, the Globus toolkit, Legion, LSF, Ninf, and
Sun’s Grid Engine.
While the Grid was originally designed to support sci-
entiﬁc applications, there has been signiﬁcant interest re-
cently in extending the model to support the needs of en-
terprise computing, including those based on Web services.
For example, both IBM and Sun have made the Grid part
of their enterprise computing strategies, while the recent
Global Grid Forum GGF-4 (http://www.gridforum.org/) in-
cluded a number of topics related to generalizing the Grid
in this way. Part of this effort includes deﬁning an Open
