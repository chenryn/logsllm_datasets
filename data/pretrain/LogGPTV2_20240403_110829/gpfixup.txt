Examples
This example assumes that you have already performed a domain rename operation in which you changed the DNS name from MyOldDnsName to MyNewDnsName, and the NetBIOS name from MyOldNetBIOSName to MyNewNetBIOSName.
In this example, you use the gpfixup command to connect to the domain controller named MyDcDnsName and repair GPOs and Group Policy links by updating the old domain name embedded in the GPOs and links. Status and error output is saved to a file that is named gpfixup.log.
gpfixup /olddns: MyOldDnsName /newdns:MyNewDnsName /oldnb:MyOldNetBIOSName /newnb:MyNewNetBIOSName /dc:MyDcDnsName 2>&1 >gpfixup.log
This example is the same as the previous one, except that it assumes the NetBIOS name of the domain was not changed during the domain rename operation.
gpfixup /olddns: MyOldDnsName /newdns:MyNewDnsName /dc:MyDcDnsName 2>&1 >gpfixup.log
