Question: If, in an unlikely scenario, the trust anchor (the root server) in a DNSSEC implementation was compromised, what would be the implications for the trust delegation process?
"A": "Trust would still be maintained for all name servers endorsed prior to the compromise due to the persistent trust anchor's initial validation.",
"B": "The entire trust delegation process would be undermined, leading to potential trust in malicious name servers.",
"C": "Only the directly connected child name servers to the compromised trust anchor would be affected, while others in the hierarchy would remain secure.",
"D": "The compromised trust anchor would have no real impact on DNSSEC, as the system is designed to handle such events without a loss of trust."
Answer: B
