Ref. #19364 (comment)
The idea would be that given a file `bar.jl` with contents `y=5`, one could do
    function foo()
        local y
        @include "bar.jl"
        return y
    end
and `foo()` would return 5, but not define a global variable `y` in the
containing module. (Using the existing `include` function, `foo()` would
define `y` globally and then fail because `y` is undefined in local scope.)
