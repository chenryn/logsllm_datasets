# Analysis of *-Substring Distribution and Router Responsiveness to Active Probes

## 1. *-Substring Distribution
Table 2 presents the frequency distribution of *-substrings with respect to their length. The table includes the number of unique *-substrings in the original data set. For uniqueness, a *-substring of length \( l \) is represented as a triplet (IP1, \( l \), IP2), and duplicate triplets are not counted.

### Observations:
- **Bimodal Behavior**: Data sets prior to 2005 contain only *-substrings of length \( l = 1 \). Starting from 2005, *-substrings of larger lengths appear, with the majority being of length \( l = 1 \) or \( l = 2 \).
- **Attribution**: This bimodal behavior can be attributed to changes in the skitter data collection process, such as increased probing rates and dynamically updating destination lists. Longer *-substrings may also be due to network growth, where more hops within an autonomous system (AS) are traversed, or increased use of MPLS.
- **ISP Cooperation**: Over the last decade, ISPs have become less cooperative with active probing, configuring routers to remain anonymous to such probes.

### Classification of *-Substrings:
- **Topological Position**: *-Substrings are classified based on the relationship between IP1 and IP2. If they share the same 16-bit IP prefix, they are assumed to belong to the same domain, and the anonymous nodes in between are also considered part of the same domain.
- **Same AS Column**: The "Same AS" column in Table 2 shows the ratio of *-substrings where IP1 and IP2 belong to the same domain. After 2004, most *-substrings (over 85%) suggest that IP1 and IP2 belong to different domains. The inconsistent trend before 2005 is attributed to the small number of *-substrings during that period.
- **Length and Origin**: Given that most *-substrings are of length \( l = 1 \) or \( l = 2 \), it is likely that they originate from routers at domain boundaries or exchange points between neighboring ASes. Despite a decrease in the number of path traces after 2004, the number of unique *-substrings increased.

## 2. Position of Anonymous Nodes
To analyze the position of anonymous nodes within path traces, we counted the number of anonymous nodes at each hop distance from trace sources, grouped by years. Figure 1 presents this distance distribution for four different years. Early data sets (before 2005) contained few anonymous nodes, mostly 10 to 20 hops away from the source. Recent data sets include many more anonymous nodes, primarily 3 to 25 hops away, with a high concentration at 2 hops for the 2008 data set.

## 3. Current Practices: Router Responsiveness to Active Probes
We conducted an experimental study to observe router responsiveness to direct and indirect probe messages using 536,743 IP addresses obtained from the skitter and iPlane projects. These IP addresses were recently collected (April 7-11, 2008) via traceroute queries.

### Direct Probing:
- **Probes Issued**: We issued UDP, TCP, and ICMP-based direct probes to each IP address and recorded the responses.
- **Response Rates** (Table 3):
  - **ICMP**: 81.9% overall, 84.6% for .net, 77.9% for .gov, 86.4% for .com, 88.9% for .edu, 95.5% for .org.
  - **TCP**: 67.3% overall, 70.4% for .net, 62.8% for .gov, 72.6% for .com, 83.2% for .edu, 77.3% for .org.
  - **UDP**: 59.9% overall, 64.7% for .net, 50.3% for .gov, 61.7% for .com, 57.3% for .edu, 64.4% for .org.
- **Security Alerts**: TCP-based probes raised security alerts, while UDP and ICMP-based probes did not. Many routers that respond to indirect probes do not respond to direct probes, with non-response rates ranging from 18% for ICMP to 40% for UDP.

### Indirect Probing:
- **Probes Issued**: We issued ICMP, TCP, and UDP-based traceroute queries toward 306K IP addresses.
- **Response Rates** (Table 4):
  - **ICMP**: 93.1% reached the final destination.
  - **TCP**: 73.4% reached the final destination.
  - **UDP**: 45.0% reached the final destination.
- **Anonymity**: UDP-based traceroute queries caused the highest anonymity percentage initially, but this trend changed after processing, indicating effective resolution of redundant nodes.

## 4. Conclusion
Our study reveals a reduction in router responsiveness to active probes over the last decade, with network operators increasingly using rate limiting. Destination reachability has also decreased, indicating a growing unwillingness to respond to direct probes. Routers are more responsive to indirect probes, particularly ICMP-based ones, compared to direct probes. TCP-based probes, while more effective than UDP, sometimes trigger security alerts.
