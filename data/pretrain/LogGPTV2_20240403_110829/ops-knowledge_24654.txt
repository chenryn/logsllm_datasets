User: I presume closing a terminal window (or a terminal window embedded in an IDE) sends some kind of OS interrupt signal to the process running in the terminal. How can I find out what this signal is? I am looking for a way to capture the interrupt, run some clean up, and then abort. I am using Python and Windows.
Assistant: Python does not seem to have an exception for this case. The closest would be SystemExit, however that does not actually capture the interrupt you're looking for.
Windows seems to actually send Ctrl+C before killing the process when you close a terminal, however capturing KeyboardInterrupt doesn't seem to work either. At this point you might want to look into the signal module.
