Question: "Your network is configured to use SNMP for device management, and you are evaluating the security controls in place to defend against unauthorized SNMP queries. Which of the following statements is a valid counterargument to the claim that 'Configuring intrusion prevention devices to only log SNMP queries from unauthorized sources is sufficient for security'?"
 "A": "Logging SNMP queries does not prevent unauthorized access; intrusion prevention devices should be configured to detect and block such queries."
 "B": "Intrusion prevention devices are not capable of detecting SNMP queries, thus logging is the only feasible option."
 "C": "SNMP queries are generally harmless, and focusing on prevention is likely to disrupt legitimate network management tasks."
 "D": "You should only monitor SNMP traffic during off-peak hours to minimize the impact on network performance."
Answer: A
