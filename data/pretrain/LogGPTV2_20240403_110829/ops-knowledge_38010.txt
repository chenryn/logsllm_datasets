User: I am working on a Python App, which runs on App Engine. Is there a way I can publish the app on each customers' appSpot account, so that the App uses the users' cloud storage? Instead of running the App on my AppSpot account and all the users storing the data on my Cloud space?
Assistant: No, you cannot do that. The app is hosted and run in the administrator's account which would be you. What you can do is, release the source code and point your users do install it in their appspot account, just like creating a new application.
