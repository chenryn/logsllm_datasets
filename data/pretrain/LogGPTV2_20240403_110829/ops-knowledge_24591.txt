User: Given an IP address and subnet mask, how to calculate the network ID and broadcast ID?
Assistant: The method of calculating the network ID and broadcast ID is as follows: 1. Convert the IP address and subnet mask into binary numbers. 2. Perform a bitwise AND operation on the IP address and subnet mask to obtain the binary number of the network ID. 3. Perform a bit-by-bit inverse operation on the IP address to obtain the inverse code (that is, bit-by-bit inversion), and then perform a bit-by-bit AND operation with the subnet mask to obtain the binary number of the broadcast address. 4. Convert the binary numbers of the network ID and broadcast address into decimal numbers, which are the corresponding network ID and broadcast ID. For example, suppose the IP address is 192.168.10.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then: 1. Convert the IP address and subnet mask into binary numbers: IP address: 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001 Subnet mask: 11111111.11111111.111 11111.00000000 2 . Perform a bit-by-bit AND operation on the IP address and subnet mask to get the binary number of the network ID: Network ID: 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000000 3. Perform a bit-by-bit inverse operation on the IP address to get the inverse code (that is, bit-by-bit inversion), and then Perform bitwise AND operation with the subnet mask to get the binary number of the broadcast address: Inverse code: 00111111.01010111.11110101.11111110 Broadcast address: 11000000.10101000.00001010.11111111 4. Convert the binary number of the network ID and broadcast address into a decimal number: Network ID: 1 92.168 .10.0 broadcast address: 192.168.10.255 Therefore, the network ID of this IP address is 192.168.10.0, and the broadcast address is 192.168.10.255.
