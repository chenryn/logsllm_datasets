User: Add a web server in the network topology diagram and configure Nginx reverse proxy to achieve load balancing and dynamic forwarding of requests.
Assistant: 1. Add a Web server Add a Web server in the network topology diagram, configure the basic environment of the Web server, and ensure that the website service can be provided normally. 2. Install and configure Nginx To install Nginx on the web server, execute the following command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx After the installation is complete, configure the Nginx reverse proxy and perform the following operations: Backup the default Nginx site configuration file. sudo mv /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.bak Create a new Nginx site configuration file. sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-site Add the following to the new file: upstream myapp { server server1.example.com; server server2.example.com; } server { listen 80; server_name www.example. com; location / { proxy_pass http://myapp; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; The upstream of myapp, which contains the addresses of two web servers. Next, define the port and domain name that the site listens to in the server block, and configure the location block for reverse proxy requests. After saving and exiting the file, link the site configuration file into the sites-enabled directory. sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-site /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ Restart the Nginx server to make the configuration take effect. sudo service nginx restart Through the above steps, you have completed the configuration of the Nginx reverse proxy, and you can verify the functions of load balancing and dynamic request forwarding by visiting the domain name of the site.
