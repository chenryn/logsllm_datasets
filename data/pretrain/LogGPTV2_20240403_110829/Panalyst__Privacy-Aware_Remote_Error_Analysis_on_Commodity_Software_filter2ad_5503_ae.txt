### Panalyst: A Privacy-Aware Approach to Remote Error Analysis

#### Introduction
In contrast to traditional methods, Panalyst reduces the user's reliance on data collectors for privacy protection. It allows users to submit only the information they are comfortable sharing. Even if this information is insufficient for reproducing an error, it can still aid other techniques in identifying the underlying bug. Additionally, the Panalyst server can automatically analyze errors caused by unknown bugs, whereas existing techniques often require human intervention for new bugs.

#### Related Work
Several proposals have been made to enhance privacy during error reporting. For instance, Scrash [25] modifies an application's source code to record crash-related information and generate a "clean" report that excludes sensitive data. However, this approach requires access to the source code and introduces performance overheads, even when the application is functioning correctly. Furthermore, like other error reporting techniques, it relies on a remote expert system for analysis, which does not perform automatic analysis of new errors.

Brickell et al. [24, 36] propose a privacy-preserving diagnostic scheme that works on binary executables. This technique aims to search a knowledge base framed as a decision tree in a privacy-preserving manner. It also requires profiling the application's execution. Unlike these approaches, Panalyst minimally interferes with the application's normal run, primarily through lightweight logging of inputs, and is designed for the automatic analysis of unknown bugs.

Techniques for the automatic analysis of software vulnerabilities have been extensively studied. Examples include the generation of vulnerability-based signatures [26], Vigilante [30], DACODA [31], and EXE [53]. These approaches assume that an input triggering an error is already available, making privacy a non-issue. Panalyst addresses the challenge of obtaining such an input while minimizing the impact on user privacy. This is achieved through the Panalyst server's analysis of the vulnerable program. Our technique combines dynamic taint analysis with symbolic execution, similar to a recent proposal for exploring multiple execution paths [42]. However, that technique is primarily designed for identifying hidden actions of malware, whereas Panalyst focuses on analyzing runtime errors. Therefore, we address issues not covered by the prior approach, such as handling tainted pointers, which are essential for reliably reproducing errors.

A recent technique has been proposed to symbolically analyze a vulnerable executable and generate an error report by solving constraints [29]. This technique also quantifies information loss using entropy. Panalyst fundamentally differs from this approach in that it generates a new input remotely, while the prior approach directly works on the causal input on the client. Performing intensive analysis on the client increases the burden and may discourage user participation. Although the prior technique reports moderate overhead [29], it does not account for computation-intensive operations like instruction-level tracing, which can introduce significant delays and large execution traces [23]. This can be barely acceptable for users with ample resources but is hardly feasible for those using weaker devices like PocketPCs and PDAs. Reproducing an error without direct access to the causal input is more challenging than local analysis, as it requires careful coordination between the client and server to gradually release input information without compromising user privacy or failing the analysis. Moreover, Panalyst can enforce privacy policies on individual protocol fields, achieving finer-grained control over information than the prior approach.

#### Conclusion and Future Work
Remote error analysis is crucial for timely discovery and resolution of security-critical vulnerabilities in applications. Such analysis is most effective when it protects user privacy, minimizes performance overheads on the client, and provides the server with sufficient information for effective bug analysis. To this end, we propose Panalyst, a new technique for privacy-aware remote error analysis. When a runtime error occurs, the Panalyst client sends the server an initial error report containing only public information about the error. Using this report, the Panalyst server analyzes the propagation of tainted data in the vulnerable application and symbolically evaluates its execution. During the analysis, the server queries the client for additional information only when necessary, and the client responds only if the answer does not leak too much user information. The server then adjusts the input content through symbolic execution and constraint solving, ultimately building a new input that includes the necessary information for reproducing the error. Our experimental study demonstrates that Panalyst exposes minimal user information, introduces negligible overheads to the client, and enables the server to effectively analyze errors.

The current design of Panalyst is tailored for errors triggered by network inputs. Future research will extend our approach to handle other types of errors. We also plan to improve techniques for estimating information leaks and reduce the number of queries the client needs to answer.
