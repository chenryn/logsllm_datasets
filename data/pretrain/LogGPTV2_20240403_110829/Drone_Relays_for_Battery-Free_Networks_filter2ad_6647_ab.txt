Before describing the details of RFly’s design, it is worth consid-
ering a simple alternative: Why not mount an entire RFID reader on
a drone and use it for localization in battery-free networks? RFly is
superior to such a design for three main reasons:
• Ability to use indoor drones: Today’s commercially available
indoor drones, such as the Parrot Bebop, can only carry a
very limited payload – between few to tens of grams [22,
23]. Because RFly’s relay weighs only 35 grams, RFly can
leverage these drones; hence, it is safe to operate indoors
and near humans. In contrast, the lightest-weight standalone
UHF RFID readers available on the market today weigh over
0.5 kg [8]. Sustaining such a payload would require relatively
larger drones which are restricted to outdoor environments
and are unsafe to fly near humans [19, 41].
• Interference management: Many of today’s factories and
warehouses are already outfitted with an infrastructure of
RFID readers. RFly can extend such an infrastructure and
incorporates mechanisms that allow us to manage interfer-
ence, while remaining transparent to the RFID communica-
tion protocol. In contrast, a flying indoor RFID reader would
introduce additional interference and result in more collisions
with an already deployed infrastructure. Addressing such in-
terference would require changing the RFID protocol.
• Generality of the proposed techniques: Finally, it is impor-
tant to note that RFly’s contributions extend beyond the spe-
cific problem of drone-based localization in battery-free net-
works. In particular, the bidirectionally full-duplex capability
can extend the coverage of battery-free networks even if in
static settings. Moreover, the phase-preserving design and the
through-relay localization algorithm extend beyond battery-
free networks to various types of wireless networks.
The following sections describe RFly’s relay design and drone-
based localization algorithm.
4 RELAY DESIGN FOR BACKSCATTER
COMMUNICATIONS
Recall from §1 that RFly’s relay must be bidirectionally full-duplex,
and it must preserve the phase and timing characteristics of the
forwarded packets to enable localization. In this section, we de-
scribe RFly’s relay design; then, in §5 we describe how it performs
localization through the relay.

self-interference between each of its transmit and receive chains.
4.1 The Challenge of Self-Interference
The key challenge in designing RFly’s relay is self-interference. To
understand this challenge, let us consider the simplest relay design,
shown in Fig. 3. In order to preserve the phase and timing character-
istics of the forwarded packets, the relay may simply amplify and
forward the received packets without performing digital manipula-
tion. However, such an approach results in self-interference, whereby
the forwarded packets feed back into the relay’s receive antennas.
Based on fundamental principles in control theory, this amplified
feedback drives the relay into an unstable state whereby it rings as
its output feeds back into its input [15]. This problem is exacerbated
by the fact that RFID communication is full-duplex in nature since
RFID tags communicate by reflecting the reader’s signal. As a result,
the relay simultaneously suffers from self-interference on both the
uplink and the downlink as can be seen in Fig. 3.
To overcome this challenge, RFly must address two types of
self-interference:
(1) Inter-link self-interference, which refers to the interference
between the uplink and downlink forwarding paths Interud
and Interdu in Fig. 3.
(2) Intra-link self-interference, which refers to the interference
between the transmit and receive antennas on each of the
uplink and downlink processing paths separately, denoted by
Intrau and Intrad respectively in Fig. 3.
Isolation vs. Communication Range. Before delving into how
RFly addresses these two types of self-interference, it is worth noting
that the amount of achieved isolation (i.e., self-interference cancella-
tion) directly impacts the communication range between the relay
and the RFID reader. Specifically, to ensure that the relay does not
oscillate, the signal arriving from the reader must be greater than the
leakage from the relay’s transmit antennas. Hence, the path loss L
between the reader and the relay must be smaller than the isolation I
between the transmit and receive antennas. Mathematically, since
path loss can be expressed as a function of the range R and the
wavelength λ, the following inequality must be satisfied:
I > L = 20 log (4πR/λ)
R/λ < 10I /20/(4π )
(3)
(4)
The inequality demonstrates that in order to achieve larger range, we
need to achieve higher isolation. Numerically, an isolation of 30dB

shows that the reader and tag’s frequency responses are separable by
a guard-band in the frequency domain.
results in a range of 0.75 m, while an isolation of 80dB results in a
range of 238 m.
Next, we describe how RFly addresses the two types of self-
interference.
4.2 Addressing Inter-Link Self-Interference
We start by addressing the self-interference between the uplink and
the downlink relay paths. Recall that an RFID responds by reflecting
the signal transmitted by the reader. Hence, both uplink and down-
link are at the same frequency. This results in leakage Interdu and
Interud in Fig. 3.
RFly’s solution to this challenge exploits the signal structure of
RFID communications in the frequency domain. Specifically, it ex-
ploits the fact that the reader’s query (on the downlink channel) and
the RFID’s response (on the uplink channel) occupy different sub-
bands around the center frequency used for communication. Fig. 4
illustrates this property by overlaying the frequency response of the
reader’s query and the RFID’s response. The figure demonstrates a
gap, which is called the guard-band, in the signal spectrum between
uplink tag response and downlink query from the reader to the RFID.
For example, the EPC Gen2 protocol allows an RFID tag backscat-
ter link frequency (BLF) as high as 640kHz while the spectrum of
reader to tag query command is constrained within 125kHz.
RFly’s design takes advantage of the guard-band by implementing
filters on the uplink and downlink relays. Note, however, that since
the frequency difference between the uplink and downlink is very
small (tens of kHz) in comparison to the center frequency (around
900MHz), implementing such filtering in passband (i.e., around
the center frequency) would require extremely high quality-factor
filters, which are unavailable on the market. Instead, we adopt a
downconvert-upconvert approach and filter in baseband.
For simplicity, let us start with the downlink channel (from the
reader to the tag). This channel occupies a small bandwidth around
the center frequency, as shown in Fig. 4. RFly downconverts the
received signal to baseband, low-pass filters, then upconverts before
transmitting it to the tag. Through this filtering, it prevents the re-
layed response’s self-interference, which is denoted as Interud in
Fig. 3 from leaking into the downlink relay channel. Similarly, on the
uplink channel (from tag to reader), RFly downconverts to baseband,
then bandpass filters around the tag’s response, then upconverts
back.

SIGCOMM ’17, August 21-25, 2017, Los Angeles, CA, USA
A natural question is: how can the relay discover the reader’s
center frequency? Specifically, a reader may send a query at any
frequency within the 900 MHz ISM band for UHF RFID commu-
nications, and the relay needs to figure out that frequency in order
to downconvert and filter in baseband. In contrast to performing a
standard Fourier transform – which would require digitizing and
processing the signal at tens of MHz of bandwidth – RFly emulates
the behavior of the Fourier transform through a simple energy de-
tection and correlation mechanism. In particular, the relay gradually
sweeps the center frequency for downconversion, correlates with all
the possible center frequencies within the ISM band, and chooses
the frequency where the correlation peaks. Mathematically, if the
incoming signal is x (t ), we can express the operation as:
ˆfc = arg max
f
−j2π f t
x (t )e
(5)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)X
t
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Note that in contrast to a Fourier transform which would first
digitize and store x (t ) then perform the transform operation, RFly’s
approach is akin to a streaming algorithm that operates on contiguous
1-ms chunks of the reader’s transmitted wave. In practice, the entire
sweeping operation takes 20 ms, after which, the relay locks onto
the frequency of the reader.3
4.3 Addressing Intra-Link Self-Interference
Next, we describe how RFly addresses intra-link interference, i.e.,
the interference due to the leakage between a given relay’s transmit
and receive antennas. This is denoted by Intrau and Intrad in Fig. 3.
RFly’s solution to this challenge is an out-of-band full-duplex de-
sign, i.e., the relay transmits at a signal whose frequency is different
from the one it receives at. To do so, it leverages the downconvert-
upconvert approach described in §4.2. For example, on the downlink
channel, it downconverts with the reader’s center frequency but up-
converts with another frequency f2, effectively achieving frequency
division between the reader-relay half-link and the relay-RFID half-
link.
Note, however, this downconvert-upconvert strategy breaks the co-
herent nature of RFID communication. Said differently, this strategy
distorts the phase of the RFID’s response, which is particularly prob-
lematic since localization relies on accurate phase measurements.
Specifically, since the relay and the reader have different oscilla-
tors, they are not synchronized and as a result, the relay introduces
a carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase offset into the signal.
Mathematically, the relay generates some frequency f ′ different than
the reader’s frequency f , and introduces a random, unknown phase
offset ϕo to the downlink signal. We can express the time-varying
induced phase as:
′
(t ) = 2π ( f − f
′
ϕ
)t + ϕ0
(6)
To address this challenge, we leverage the fact that RFly has con-
trol over both the downlink and uplink relays. Hence, we design the
uplink forwarding path such that it inverts the effect of the downlink
path by mirroring its behavior. Specifically, on the uplink processing
path, it upconverts with the same oscillator used for downconversion
3Note that in certain regions of the world, the regulations dictate that the reader hops
frequencies every half second according to a prespecified pattern. Once the relay iden-
tifies the center frequency at a given point in time, it can lock onto the same hopping
pattern. [2]
on the downlink relay. This induces a phase shift −ϕ′(t ), which
cancels the effect of the oscillator discrepancies between the relay
and the reader. Such an approach restores the coherent nature of
the communication link and allows the relay to act as a transparent
intermediary between the reader and the RFIDs in the environment.
A few additional points are worth noting:
• In the presence of multiple RFID readers in the environment,
the relay automatically selects the frequency of the reader
with the strongest receive signal as per Eq. 5. Once it locks
onto the corresponding reader’s center frequency, the base-
band filters on the downlink and uplink filter out the signals
of all other readers, naturally managing the interference.4
• The above discussion focuses on the operation of a single
relay. In practice, RFly’s design can extend to multiple relays,
which may be daisy chained. The system architecture and
analysis of such a system are outside the scope of this paper.
• Finally, in contrast to past relay architectures which can
achieve up to 2× range extension between communicating
nodes, RFly’s relay enables increasing the communication
range by orders of magnitude between the reader and RFIDs
in the environment. This owes primarily to the fact that
battery-free RFIDs rely on the signal received on the down-
link channel to power up, typically requiring about -15dBm
of received signal strength [12]. This requirement limits the
path loss budget on the downlink channel; as a result, existing
readers have a maximum range of few meters [47, 50]. In
contrast, by employing a relay, we can decouple the commu-
nication range from the powering up range in passive RFID
communications. Specifically, while the half-link between the
relay and an RFID remains limited to few meters, the range
between the relay and the reader is only limited by our iso-
lation ability (as evident from Eq. 4). In §7, we demonstrate
how we can achieve multiple tens of meters in range.
5 THROUGH-RELAY LOCALIZATION
In this section, we describe how RFly can localize a single RFID by
mounting our relay on a drone. The same technique generalizes to a
large number of tags in the environment.
RFly’s approach builds on past work on synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) [17, 28, 45]. Specifically, as the drone flies, the relay cap-
tures the RFID responses from different locations along the drone’s
trajectory, and treats these spatial measurements as an antenna ar-
ray. Subsequently, by applying antenna array equations to these
measurements, it can localize the RFIDs.
While our approach is inspired by SAR, it faces two key chal-
lenges which are unique to our system architecture:
(1) Phase entanglement: First, since the reader obtains phase
measurements through the relay, the measured phase does not
consist of single direction as in typical antenna array scenarios
(e.g., Fig. 2(a)). Rather, the phase consists of two half-links:
one between the reader and the relay and another between
the relay and the RFID tag, as shown in Fig. 2(b). In order
to apply antenna array equations, RFly must first disentangle
4In the event that multiple readers transmit at the same frequency, we can leverage past
work on multi-reader interference management [25].

the two half-links and distill the phases corresponding to the
relay-RFID link as we describe in §5.1.
(2) Multipath: The second challenge stems from multipath in
the environment. Specifically, the packets traveling on each of
the links do not arrive only on the direct line-of-sight between
the nodes. Rather, they bounce off of different objects in
the environment, including walls and furniture, as shown in
Fig. 5. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the direct
path on each of these links may be significantly attenuated by
