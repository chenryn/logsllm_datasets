### Log Analysis and Troubleshooting

#### Initial Logs (October 16, 2023)
The logs from `sdnotify-proxy` on October 16, 2023, show a series of events related to VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network) operations. The key points are:

- **Ignoring Not a Miss**: Multiple entries indicate that certain MAC addresses and IP addresses were ignored because they were not misses.
  - Examples:
    - `96:75:16:ae:1e:ce, 10.2.58.9`
    - `be:66:1c:f3:6f:bf, 10.2.59.8`

- **L3 Misses**: A few L3 (Layer 3) misses were detected, and the system attempted to resolve them by setting the neighbor (NeighSet).
  - Examples:
    - `L3 miss: 10.2.59.9` followed by `calling NeighSet: 10.2.59.9, be:66:1c:f3:6f:bf`
    - `L3 miss: 10.2.58.3` followed by `calling NeighSet: 10.2.58.3, 96:75:16:ae:1e:ce`

- **AddL3 Succeeded**: After each L3 miss, the `AddL3` operation succeeded.

No fatal errors were observed in these logs.

#### Kubelet Restart (October 17, 2023)
After observing the logs, the `kubelet` service was restarted using the following command:
```sh
$ systemctl restart kubelet
```
The subsequent `journalctl` output for `kubelet` showed the following issues:

- **Kubelet Startup**:
  - The kubelet started to sync pod status with the API server.
  - The main sync loop was initiated.
  - However, the kubelet skipped pod synchronization due to the container runtime being down.

- **Fatal Error**:
  - A critical error occurred: `crypto/tls: failed to parse certificate PEM data`.
  - This error caused the kubelet service to exit with a status code of 255.
  - The systemd logs indicated that the `kubelet.service` entered a failed state and exited with an `exit-code`.

#### Potential Cause and Fix
A colleague mentioned a similar issue on a different node where the RSA keys disappeared. He resolved it by copying the keys from another server. This suggests that the `crypto/tls: failed to parse certificate PEM data` error might be due to missing or corrupted TLS certificates.

#### Impact and Next Steps
- **Impact**: All pods were quickly relocated to a functioning node, minimizing the impact.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Verify the presence and integrity of the TLS certificates on the affected node.
  - If the certificates are missing or corrupted, copy them from a known good node.
  - Investigate the root cause of the certificate issue to prevent future occurrences.
  - Consider implementing monitoring and alerting for certificate-related issues.

By addressing the potential certificate issue, you can ensure the stability and reliability of the Kubernetes cluster.
