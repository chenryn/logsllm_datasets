Passing invalid inputs to `ndarray.flat` will raise an error, but after the
interpreter finishes there's a reference count error (python attempts to
deallocate the integer 7):
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.arange(3).flat[None]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "", line 1, in 
    IndexError: unsupported iterator index
    >>> 
    *** Reference count error detected: 
    an attempt was made to deallocate 7 (l) ***
The issue is there in master.
~~This is probably related to (or a duplicate of)#7982. The reason why I'm not
sure this is a duplicate is because the other issue tries assigning to invalid
memory, whereas here we're only attempting a read, and that could fail before
breaking anything.~~ Update: Since this is a different part of the code
(subscription rather than subscripted assignment) and the input type
triggering the error is different, I don't think it's related to that issue
after all.
