User: How to identify and deal with common security threats in cyberspace?
Assistant: Common security threats in cyberspace include: 1. Viruses and malware: Viruses and malware are common security threats. This software can be installed on a computer without the user's permission, stealing data or damaging the system. 2. Phishing attack: Phishing attack is a fraudulent attack in which attackers pretend to be legitimate institutions or companies to send emails, text messages or social media information, and lure users to click links or download files.

Denial of service attack: Denial of service attack means that the attacker sends a large number of requests to the target system, causing the system to be paralyzed or unable to provide services. 5. Password attacks: Password attacks include guessing passwords, using brute force cracking tools, and intercepting known passwords for access. Attackers can obtain sensitive user information or steal data. How to identify and deal with common security threats in cyberspace: 1. Use antivirus software: Using antivirus software can help identify and prevent the spread of malware. 2. Be wary of emails and social media messages: Be wary of emails and social media messages from unknown sources and avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments. 3. Updating the system and software: Keeping the system and software updated helps to fix software vulnerabilities, basic data security education, improving user awareness of prevention, avoiding password disclosure or using weak passwords, etc. 4. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication: Use strong passwords that are difficult to guess and enable multi-factor authentication for even stronger security. 5. Configure network security devices: By configuring network security devices (such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc.), additional security protection can be provided.
