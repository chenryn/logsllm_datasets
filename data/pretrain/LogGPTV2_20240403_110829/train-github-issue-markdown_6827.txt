# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem?
Currently it's not possible to make async operations before exporting the
handler from a API route.
## Describe the solution you'd like
I'd like to be able to use the same mecanism from micro to be able to do async
work before returning a handler.
## Additional context
I opened a discussion about it on spectrum : https://spectrum.chat/next-
