User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to restart PHP-FPM from cron? I'm trying to restart PHP5-FPM periodically using Cron, but am having no luck.

I can restart manually with no problems, using service php5-fpm restart or /usr/sbin/service php5-fpm restart

However, when I use the same command, including using the full path to /usr/sbin/service, nothing happens. The cronjob does run (as I see from the syslog), but PHP5-FPM does not restart.

The relevant line of my root user's crontab looks as follows:

* * * * * /usr/sbin/service php5-fpm restart


I have confirmed with which service that the path to service is indeed /usr/sbin/service.

Why is this not working?

Assistant: You can use initctl:

/sbin/initctl  restart php5-fpm
