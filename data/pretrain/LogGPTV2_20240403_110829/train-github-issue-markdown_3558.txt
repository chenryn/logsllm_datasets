Please answer these questions before submitting your issue. Thanks!
  1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
Go tip.
  1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?
OS X and Linux on Travis
  1. What did you do?
Build Hugo (https://github.com/spf13/hugo).
If possible, provide a recipe for reproducing the error.  
A complete runnable program is good.  
A link on play.golang.org is best.
See https://travis-ci.org/spf13/hugo/builds/121437210
  1. What did you expect to see?
All green.
  1. What did you see instead?
Build fails on Go tip, both OS X and Linux.
I tried to see if this is a duplicate of an already reported issue, but it's
hard to tell.
There is a test failure that I haven't looked into, but then there are these
build failures:
    19.35s$ go build -race
    # github.com/pkg/sftp
    ../../pkg/sftp/client.go:829: internal error: (*File).WriteTo autotmp_781 (type *[]byte) recorded as live on entry, p.Pc=10248
    # github.com/russross/blackfriday
    ../../russross/blackfriday/html.go:932: internal error: (*Html).ensureUniqueHeaderID autotmp_747 (type *int) recorded as live on entry, p.Pc=15486
Not sure when these failures started to happen ...
