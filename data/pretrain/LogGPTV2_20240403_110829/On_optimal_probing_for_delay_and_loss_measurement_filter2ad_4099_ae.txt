### Scenarios of Non-Convexity and Their Implications

Scenarios such as those illustrated in Figure 12, where convexity does not hold, can occur if the covariance functions oscillate. A necessary condition for such oscillations is that typical sample paths themselves exhibit reproducible oscillations. This is expected to happen only when a very small number of flows with feedback have a significant impact on the path. Our results show that this does not typically occur in the Internet core.

Even if \( R(\tau) \) is not convex everywhere, it may be convex over a domain of interest. For example, there may be probing rates that we are constrained to use, resulting in the non-convex domain of \( R(\tau) \) never being sampled. In other words, practical sampling may occur at time scales (or below, when stationarity fails at very large scales) where a lack of convexity is not an issue. In all such cases, our theorems remain highly useful.

### Auto-Covariance Function Analysis

Figure 11 shows the auto-covariance (un-normalized) function of \( I_x \) for a 3-hop system involving a combination of TCP, Poisson, and Pareto cross-traffic. The left-hand plot is a zoomed-in version of the right-hand one, showing more detail. Three different results are presented, depending on how many cross-traffic streams have periodic features.

### Practical Implications and Related Work

In [2], we introduced the probe separation rule as a guideline for designing probing streams. Although Gamma distributions for all finite \( \beta \) do not have a lower bound above zero, as suggested by this rule, the work in this paper is consistent with its spirit. This is because the probability that inter-probe times are smaller than \( \epsilon \) approaches zero as \( \beta \) goes to infinity for all \( \epsilon \) strictly less than the mean inter-probe time.

Gamma probing streams with \( \beta > 1 \) are superior to Poisson probing streams in terms of variance when \( R(\tau) \) is convex. This property allows for tunability, enabling different trade-offs. We exploited this in Section 4.5, suggesting the use of Gamma probing streams with small shape values, which avoid the anomalous behavior exhibited by high shape values while still outperforming Poisson probing.

Our results in Sections 4 and 5 demonstrate the advantages of Gamma probing for a wide range of metrics, including mean delay, delay quantiles, and loss indicator functions. We did find extreme cases where a single dominating TCP flow can introduce non-convexity for loss probing. Future work will focus on understanding the reasons behind such non-convexity and investigating its occurrence in practice.

Throughout this paper, we assumed non-intrusive probing and ignored the perturbative impact of probing. As discussed in [2], non-intrusive results can be applied to the estimation of delay-based metrics in practice as long as probing is rare. In [3], we showed that similar results are valid for the estimation of loss-based metrics. The general idea is that if a system 'forgets its past' quickly enough, then probes sent rarely enough emulate non-intrusive probing. Rare probing is one way our results can be applied in practice, allowing us to benefit from the low variance of Gamma probing with minimal perturbative effect.

### Delay and Loss Measurement

Delay and loss measurement has been the focus of many earlier papers [14, 15, 18, 22]. Early measurement studies [15] primarily used Poisson sampling. Zhang et al. [22] used Poisson sampling to study the time-varying nature of delay, loss, and other path characteristics. The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Group [8] also recommends Poisson sampling for loss measurement.

Recently, the utility of Poisson sampling for delay has been questioned [2, 17]. Empirical studies [18, 10] have also challenged this premise. The importance of variance, in addition to bias, for good measurements was stated in [2]. Preliminary results showing the non-optimality of Poisson probing were provided in [2].

Techniques have been proposed for better probing. For instance, Badabing [18] is a tool for loss measurement that proposes a specific probing process assuming the loss process is Markovian. In contrast, our work is quite general and provides insights into the measurement of any metric.

### Conclusions

We have taken a fundamental look at the issue of optimal probing for delay and loss measurement. Given that a large variety of so-called mixing probe processes enjoy the strong consistency property, we investigated the mixing probing process that would minimize estimation variance. In the context of non-intrusive probing, we proved that periodic probing has the least variance if the auto-covariance of the measured metric is convex. However, periodic probing is not mixing and can have phase-locking issues, leading to significant sample path bias.

We showed that an alternative family of probing processes, Gamma renewal processes, provide a good middle ground: they have no sample-path bias and can achieve variance as close to periodic as possible when the auto-covariance of the measured metric is convex. Using extensive experiments, primarily on a unique set of full-router datasets, we demonstrated the validity of this convexity condition and the sub-optimality of Poisson probing.

### Appendix

#### Proof of Lemma 3.1

Let \( T \sim \Gamma(\alpha, \lambda) \) and \( Z \sim \Gamma(\beta, \lambda) \) be independent, and set \( Y = T + Z \). Then \( C = \mathbb{E}[T|Y] = \frac{\alpha Y}{\alpha + \beta} \) has a density \( \Gamma(\alpha + \beta, \frac{(\alpha + \beta)\lambda}{\alpha}) \), with mean \( \mathbb{E}[C] = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda} = \mathbb{E}[T] \).

**Proof.** From the scaling property of the Gamma distribution, \( Y \sim \Gamma(\alpha + \beta, \lambda) \).

\[ \Pr(T = x, Z = y - x) \]

Since \( T \) and \( Z \) are independent, the density of \( (T|Y = y) \) is:

\[ \Pr(T = x|Y = y) = \frac{\Pr(T = x, Y = y)}{\Pr(Y = y)} = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)(x) \Gamma(\beta, \lambda)(y - x)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta, \lambda)(y)} = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta)} x^{\alpha-1} (y - x)^{\beta-1} y^{1-(\alpha + \beta)} \]

Recall the Beta function \( B(x, y) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)} \). The required conditional expectation is given by:

\[ \mathbb{E}[T|Y = y] = \int_0^y x \cdot \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta)} x^{\alpha-1} (y - x)^{\beta-1} y^{1-(\alpha + \beta)} dx \]

\[ = \frac{y^{1-(\alpha + \beta)}}{B(\alpha, \beta)} \int_0^y x^{\alpha} (y - x)^{\beta-1} dx \]

\[ = \frac{y^{1-(\alpha + \beta)}}{B(\alpha, \beta)} y^{\alpha + \beta} B(\alpha + 1, \beta) \]

\[ = \frac{\alpha y}{\alpha + \beta} \]

Now viewing \( y \) as a sample of \( Y \), we have \( C = \mathbb{E}[T|Y] = \frac{\alpha Y}{\alpha + \beta} \), which is Gamma as stated by the scaling property.

#### Calculating Auto-Covariance of \( I_x(t) \)

In Section 5.2, we calculate the auto-covariance of \( I_x(t) \), the ground truth loss process. We now explain how we calculate \( I_x(t) \).

Consider a single hop in a network employing a byte-based dropping policy. By definition, \( I_x(t) \) for that hop depends only on the queue size at that hop (and \( x \)). Using a complete trace of packet sizes and arrival times to the hop, we can compute the queue size at any time \( t \) and, therefore, compute \( I_x(t) \) too.

Although \( I_x(t) \) is a continuous-time process, it can be efficiently stored. Note that there are a finite set of 'change points' where the value of \( I_x(t) \) changes. These are precisely those instants when the queue size crosses a threshold. The threshold corresponds to the point above which there are fewer than \( x \) bytes available in the queue.

We use a similar approach to calculate \( I_x(t) \) for multi-hop paths. However, recall that \( I_x(t) \) is an indicator function for the event that a probe of size \( x \), had it entered the system at time \( t \), encounters a queue that has fewer than \( x \) bytes available. Hence, in a multi-hop path, \( I_x(t) \) depends on the buffer size of intermediate hops at time instants that may be after \( t \). Therefore, to calculate \( I_x(t) \), we also compute these time instants. As with single-hop paths, \( I_x(t) \) can be efficiently stored; it has a finite set of 'change points', which correspond to the time instants when any queue along the path crosses a threshold. As before, the threshold corresponds to the point above which there are fewer than \( x \) bytes available.

In ns-2, queue occupancy does not include the current packet being transmitted. Hence, to obtain the ground truth loss process for our simulations, we calculate 'change points' of this alternative definition of queue size.
