It is common practice to limit the size of a workgroup by blocking on sends to a buffered channel, where the channel's capacity is set to the desired workgroup size. This technique has also been employed in the standard library. However, discussions on both the golang-nuts and golang-dev forums have raised concerns, with some comments suggesting that this behavior is not formally guaranteed, despite it working in current runtime implementations.

It would be beneficial to either provide a formal guarantee that this idiom will continue to function as expected, or to explicitly state that no such guarantee exists.
