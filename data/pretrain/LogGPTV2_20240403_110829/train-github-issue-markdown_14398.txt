    It has been common to use the idiom of limiting a workgroup size by blocking on send to
    a buffered chan, where the cap of the chan is set to the desired workgroup size. This
    approach has also been used in the standard library.
    However there has been discussion in both golang-nuts and golang-dev with comments that
    suggest that this behaviour is not formally guaranteed to work (although it does in the
    current runtime implementations).
    I would be good to have either a guarantee that the idiom is guaranteed to continue to
    work or that there is no guarantee.
