Question: "In the context of Android security, if a security analyst argues that attestation certificates generated at the `Software` security level are equally as secure as those generated at the `StrongBox` level, what would be the best counterargument to this claim?"
 "A": "Attestations at the `Software` level are only as secure as the Android system itself, which can be more easily compromised than dedicated hardware security modules."
 "B": "The `Software` level indicates that the attestation is generated in a TEE, which is less secure than the Android system."
 "C": "Attestations generated at the `StrongBox` level are considered less secure because they rely on software-based protections."
 "D": "The `StrongBox` level is not recognized in Android security and therefore cannot be compared to the `Software` level."
Answer: A
