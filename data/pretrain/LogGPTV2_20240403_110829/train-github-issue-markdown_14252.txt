In VS 2015 Pro, using the Asp.Net 5 Web Application template, I have installed
via npm the typings js module, which in concert with a typings.json file will
install Typescript definition files to a typings folder as so...
  * Project 
    * wwwroot
    * Controllers
    * scripts
    * typings 
      * browser
      * main
      * browser.d.ts
      * main.d.ts
    * Views
    * tsconfig.json
    * typings.json
The browser folder and browser.d.ts is intended for clientside while the main
folder and main.d.ts file are intended for serverside, and one should pick
which they want to use, and exclude the other.
With TS 1.7.3 installed, one excluded the main files in the tsconfig.json as
so (this worked - last two entries in exclude array):
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "noImplicitAny": false,
        "noEmitOnError": true,
        "removeComments": false,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "target": "es5",
        "outDir": "wwwroot/js",
        "rootDir": "scripts",
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "module": "system"
      },
      "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "wwwroot",
        "typings/main",
        "typings/main.d.ts"
      ]
    }
After installing TS 1.8.4, I now get Duplicate identifier errors between files
in the typings/main and typings/browser folder. In other words, the subfolder
exclude for "typings/main" is not being respected.
Experimenting a bit, the "node_modules" and "wwwroot" is being excluded
correctly. If I exclude the root folder "typings" then the error goes away,
but no typings load from any files either. Also trying to exclude a file in a
subfolder, say "typings/main/ambient/bootstrap/bootstrap.d.ts" doesn't work.
So there appears to be a bug excluding subfolders/subfiles.
The expected behavior is for subfiles or subfolders in the exclude array to be
ignored during compile. The actual behavior is that they are not excluded.
