It would be useful to us and I'm pretty sure to other people to be able to
call gemm in C.  
There is the file numpy/core/src/multiarray/cblasfuncs.c that contain this
function:
    static void
    gemm(int typenum, enum CBLAS_ORDER order,
         enum CBLAS_TRANSPOSE transA, enum CBLAS_TRANSPOSE transB,
         int m, int n, int k,
         PyArrayObject *A, int lda, PyArrayObject *B, int ldb, PyArrayObject *R)
Giving access to it would solve this, this function is currently private and
do not do error checking. The function:
    NPY_NO_EXPORT PyObject *
    cblas_matrixproduct(int typenum, PyArrayObject *ap1, PyArrayObject *ap2,
                        PyArrayObject *out)
In the same file does the error checking, but do not allow the alpha and beta
parameter.
Before going further and plan how to implement it. Would a PR that add a
public function PyArray_Gemm that take the 3 ndarray + alpha + beta be
accepted?
