**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Image File Execution Options Injection

Adversaries may use Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content. IFEOs are a feature in Windows that allows developers to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, if a debugger is specified in the application’s IFEO settings, the system prepends the debugger to the application’s name. This effectively launches the new process under the control of the debugger.

For example, if an IFEO is set for `notepad.exe` with the debugger `C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g`, the system will launch `C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe` instead of just `notepad.exe`. This can be exploited by adversaries to execute arbitrary code or load a malicious DLL, thereby achieving persistence or privilege escalation.
