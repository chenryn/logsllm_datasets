I am building react js app based on nextjs boilerplate.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Check if router has previous url or not.
## Current Behavior
The tab is being closed on router.back()
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
router.back()
## Context
I need to get the previous url to redirect the user back to the page after
signin in my app. It works fine if there is any other page visited before the
signin page. But when user directly open signin page in new tab, there will be
no previous url. So in router.back() it closes the tab.
