Abstract—With  the  rapid  development  data  mining  within 
various  fields  and  security  and  privacy  concerns  come  into 
view.  In  data  mining  while  releasing  micro-data  or  patterns 
from large databases individual or organizational private data 
may  get  compromise  the  information.  The  main  aim  behind 
privacy  preserving  data  mining  is  to  maximizing  analysis 
outcome  and  minimizing  disclosure  of 
individuals  or 
organizational private data. Association rule mining explores 
interesting relationship between data. This paper is based on 
concepts:  condensation  method  and  association  rule.  SMC 
(secure  multiparty  computation)  securely  transferring  data 
over  the  network  with  hiding  process  which  hide  sensitive 
association rule which create threat to privacy. Now privacy 
preserving  data  mining  has  become  increasingly  popular 
because  it  provides  sharing  of  private  or  sensitive  data  for 
analysis purposes. Most of people and organizations are afraid 
or hesitate to share their data or refusing to share their data 
or  sometimes  might  provide  wrong  data.  Due  to  rapid 
proliferation  of  private  information  on  the  internet,  lot  of 
research has been done in recent years for privacy preserving 
data  mining.  Users  are  unwilling  to  provide  private  or 
personal data unless and until privacy is assured. Sometimes 
automated  transaction  system  holds  or  track  information 
about individuals in day today’s life. For example credit card 
transactions.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Now it has become more and more important in recent 
years  and  even  for  future  because  day  by  day  data  is 
growing  rapidly  and  even  increasing  ability  to  store  that 
data about users and organizations personal information. It 
is difficult to handle and preserve such a huge data.  
In  recent  years  to  provide  privacy  preserving  data 
mining  number  of  techniques  have  been  suggested  like 
classification, K anonymity, clustering and association rule 
mining algorithm to hold information. Various data mining 
techniques  are  successfully  used 
to  retrieve  useful 
knowledge in order to provide support a variety of domains 
like  marketing,  medical  diagnosis,  research,  weather 
forecasting  ,military  or  security.  But  it  is  still  challenging 
issue in various domains to provide privacy to certain kind 
of  information  without  violating  the  individual’s  privacy. 
For  example- In  credit  card transactions while  purchasing 
frequently used items, while mining patients private data in 
health care or research purpose.  
Data mining is spreading widely throughout an area or 
a  group  of  people  on  internet  so  privacy  concerns  are 
age 
and 
increasing.  Most  of  the  organizations  collect  data  about 
users  for  their  own  specific  needs.  However  different 
branches  within  an  organization  themselves  may  need  to 
share  information.  In  this  situation  each  organization  or 
branch  must  be  sure  that  privacy  of  the  individual  is  not 
violated  and  private  or  sensitive  business  information 
should not get disclosed. 
A  wide  variety  of  sources  holds  individuals  private 
data such as banks(personal information name, birth-date , 
PAN ), police records(name, address, birth marks, physical 
number 
appearance), 
departure,destination, 
gender) 
expenditure data  while purchasing or bank transaction. 
(passport 
duration, 
airports 
In most of countries sharing individual private data or 
exposing  confidential  information  is  against  the  law  to 
share  or  make  such  information  publicly  available  to 
others.  
In  this  project,  in  order  to  preserve  privacy  of  such 
information  records  can  be  de-  identified  before  the 
information  records  are  shared  with  other  users  without 
violating individual’s privacy.This can be done by deleting 
unique  identity  fields  item  such  as  passport  no,age.  But 
even if this information is deleted there are still other kinds 
of  information  fields  when  linked  with  other  fields 
available in datasets could identify the individual. 
To provide security for such types of violations, I need 
variety of data mining algorithm. It is important problem in 
recent  years,  because  of  the  large  amount  of  user’s  data 
tracked  by  automated  systems  on  the  internet.  Due  to  the 
growing market of electronic commerce on the internet has 
resulted  holding  large  amounts  of  transactional  data  with 
personal  information  about  users.While  doing  simple 
transaction  such  as  using  credit  card  results  in  automated 
system  store  information  about  users  buying  behavior. 
Sometime  users  are  unwilling  to  supply  such  private  data 
unless and until privacy is guaranteed.  
In order to provide and ensure effective data gathering, 
it  is  important  to  implement  methods  which  minimize 
disclosure risk and maximize the mining analysis outcome 
with a guarantee of privacy.

Several  research  communities  contributed  their  work 
to  privacy  preserving  data  mining  using  variety  of 
technique. Let first discuss privacy preserving work in the 
data mining community. Over the past few years, variety of 
approaches  has  been  proposed  in  the  area  of  privacy 
preserving data mining. Some of the important approaches 
include  cryptographic  approach,  heuristic  approach  and 
reconstruction based approach.  
The  concept  of  the  heuristic  approach  method  is  the 
way to hide sensitive rules which is used to be mined from 
the dataset while  maximizing the outcome of the released 
data.  
The  second  approach  is  Cryptography  based  method, 
This  approach  has  been  developed  to  solve  the  problem 
such as SMC: If  Two or more parties want to perform a 
computation  based  on  their  private  inputs,  but  party  is 
unwilling to disclose its own output to any other else. Such 
problem 
the  Secure  Multiparty 
Computation (SMC) problem. 
referred 
Next  approach  is  reconstruction  based  method,In  this 
approach  they  first  used  some  methods  to  distort  or  twist 
the values of the original data and then release these twisted 
data.

relational  association 
Another  important  approach  is  the  Access  control 
based approach. It was built over existing technologies was 
proposed  called  Multi- 
rules 
(MRAR).  This  model  has 
those  are 
Authenticator,  checker  and  the  database  server.  MRAR  is 
the type of policy where the users are associated to mining 
levels which is mandatory access control. Disadvantage of 
MRAR is that it is not always possible to assign sensitivity 
levels to data in case level contains another level. 
Anonymization  Method:  This  method  is  used  to 
protect user’s identities while releasing micro data. The k-
anonymity protects against identity disclosure. But it does 
not  provide  sufficient  protection  against  field’s  disclosure 
and original data can be reconstructed. 
Perturbation  Method:  Independent  operation 
is 
performed  on  the  different  fields  by  this  method.  This 
method  does  not  reconstruct  the  original  data  values,  but 
only  distribution,new  algorithms  have  been  developed 
which  uses  these  reconstructed  distributions  to  carry  out 
mining of the data available. 
Randomized Response Method: This is very simple 
technique which can be easily implemented at the time of 
data collection. It is useful technique for hiding individual 
data  in  PPDM.  This  method  results  in  high  information 
loss. It is not suitable for multiple attribute databases. 
Rather than participants input and output no more data 
get  disclosed 
to  a  participant  while  performing 
computation. But  it  is  important  to  let  know  that  the data 
modification  results  is  degrading  the  performance  of 
database. 
Degradation  of  data  is  measured  in  two  dimension 
metrics .The first dimension measures the confidential data 
security and second measures the loss of functionality.
