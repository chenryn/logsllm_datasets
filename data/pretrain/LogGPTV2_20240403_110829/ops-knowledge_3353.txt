User: This is probably a very simple question. But it's driving me nuts and I can't find the solution. I setup Eclipse and PyDev in my Windows box and I've written a class to do something. Then I created another .py file to run a program that users that class, but the program cannot find the class. 
It works well if I put all code in the same file, which is umanagable, but not in separate 
files. 
Also, I looked at my PYTHONPATH variable in Eclipse and it has the path of the folder i have my code in. 
Any ideas why it doesn't recognize all the files in the same folder?
Assistant: If I understand you correctly, you need to import the other class from the other file into your original file to be able to use the class.
For example, from otherfile import OtherClass
Otherwise, please add more info.
