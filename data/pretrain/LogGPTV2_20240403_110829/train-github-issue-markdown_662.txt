I just noticed after I update to version alpha `27` that if I have the
following `@RouteConfig`:
    @RouteConfig([{
        component: Test,
        path: '/',
        as: 'test'
    }])
I will see two of the same component, but if I change the path to anything
else I do not get the same behaviour.
