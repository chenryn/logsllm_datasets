After updating to version Alpha 27, I observed an issue with the `@RouteConfig` when using the following configuration:

```typescript
@RouteConfig([{
    component: Test,
    path: '/',
    as: 'test'
}])
```

In this setup, the `Test` component is rendered twice. However, if I change the `path` to any other value, the duplication does not occur.
