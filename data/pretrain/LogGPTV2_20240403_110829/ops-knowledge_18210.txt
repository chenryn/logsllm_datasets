User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Check Primary Authentication Protocol for Active Directory (NTLM or Kerberos?) How can I check, from a client machine (in Global Group)(also is local admin), whether the domain controller is authenticating my login request to the domain using NTLM or Kerberos?

I know that Kerberos is enabled by default, but the domain Admin can always force clients to auth with other Protocols. So i just want to be sure which protocal they are using. Are there any methods to do to check?

Any help would be appreciated

Assistant: Greg's answer is alright, but your question specifically states that you want to check this from the client, not from the domain controller. So I'll take a crack at it.

First way, enable Kerberos logging on your client:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters
    LogLevel DWORD 0x1


Once Kerberos logging is enabled, then, log into stuff and watch the event log. If you're using Kerberos, then you'll see the activity in the event log. If you are passing your credentials and you don't see any Kerberos activity in the event log, then you're using NTLM.

Second way, you can use the klist.exe utility to see your current Kerberos tickets. This will definitely help you if you are authenticating to a service for the first time, because you will be getting a new ticket... but for subsequent authentications to the same service, you can reuse the same ticket, and so klist.exe may be of limited use to you.

Third way, watch the authentication happen with Wireshark.
