### Title: Searching for RPC Functions to Coerce Authentications in Microsoft Protocols

#### Abstract:
Microsoft's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocols have been in use for several decades, yet they have often lacked a thorough security analysis. These protocols have been a source of numerous security vulnerabilities, including coerced authentications, Local Privilege Escalations (LPE), and Remote Code Executions (RCE). This presentation delves into the current state of research on coerced authentications via RPC, and introduces a method to automatically identify potentially vulnerable RPC calls from Microsoft's documentation.

#### Presentation Overview:
1. **Introduction to Coerced Authentications and RPC:**
   - Background on the history and usage of Microsoft RPC.
   - Common security weaknesses associated with RPC, such as coerced authentications, LPE, and RCE.

2. **Automated Identification of Vulnerable RPC Calls:**
   - A detailed explanation of a novel method to parse Microsoft's OpenSpecs online documentation and Interface Definition Language (IDL) code.
   - The process of using this data to automatically identify RPC calls that may trigger authentication requests.
   - Generation of Python proof-of-concept (PoC) code to remotely trigger these RPC calls.

3. **Demonstration and Case Studies:**
   - Step-by-step demonstration of how to relay a coerced HTTP authentication to Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).
   - Examples of known vulnerabilities discovered using this method, such as PrinterBug, PetitPotam, ShadowCoerce, and DFSCoerce.
   - Showcasing the rapid identification of these vulnerabilities within minutes.

4. **Tools and Resources:**
   - Release of an open-source wiki containing all identified RPC calls that can be used to coerce authentications, along with their corresponding Python PoC code.
   - Introduction of a set of tools for fuzzing Microsoft RPC protocols remotely.
   - An open-source tool designed to automatically call every RPC function capable of coercing authentication from a Windows machine to an arbitrary target.

#### Conclusion:
This talk aims to advance the field of security research by providing a systematic approach to identifying and exploiting coerced authentication vulnerabilities in Microsoft RPC. By automating the process of vulnerability discovery, we can more effectively secure our systems against these threats. Attendees will leave with practical tools and resources to further explore and mitigate these vulnerabilities in their own environments.
