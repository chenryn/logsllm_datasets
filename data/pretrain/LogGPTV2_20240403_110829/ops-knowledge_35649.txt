User: I have installed the new python release and would like to run .py files from the terminal.
How is this done from the terminal? I dont want to include the path in each command to run a .py file.
Assistant: if you add a shebang at the start of the python file then you can run a python file by just its name from terminal
add #!/usr/bin/python
for mac(others add your respective path for python)
at the top of your python program and from your terminal you can run it just by filename(if it has executable permissions).
