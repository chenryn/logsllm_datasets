ABSTRACT 
“Real money trading” or “Gold farming” refers to a set of 
illicit practices for gathering and distributing virtual goods 
in online games for real money. Unlike previous work, we 
use  network-wide  economic  interactions  among  in-game 
characters  as  a  lens  to  monitor,  detect  and  identify  gold 
farming  networks.  Our  work  is  based  on  a  set  of  real  in-
game  trade  activity  logs  collected  for  one  month  in  year 
2010  from  the  world’s  second  largest  MMORPG  called 
AION (with 3.4 million subscribers). This is the first work 
that  empirically  (i)  shows  that  “free  money  network”  is  a 
promising  measure/approximation 
for  detecting  and 
characterizing gold farming networks, and (ii) measures the 
size of the free money net and in-game virtual economy in 
a large-scale MMORPG in terms of the cash flow.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
“Real money trading” or “Gold farming” refers to a set 
of  illicit  practices  for  gathering  and  distributing  virtual 
goods in online games for real money [1]. During the last 
decade  gold  farming  has  become  a  vast  enterprise  (a  best 
estimate  suggests  that  in  Asia,  where  most  of  the  gold 
farmers dwell, more than 400,000 players spend their days 
stocking up on gold [2]). Gold farming industries have been 
grown  up  on  the  periphery  of  the  virtual  world  of  online 
games  known  as  MMORPGs  (Massively  Multiplayer 
Online  Role  Playing  Games)  such  as  World  of  Warcraft, 
EverQuest, and AION.  
One  of  the  core  components  of  the  virtual  world  that 
helps to attract millions of gamers along  with its fantastic 
settings  of  landscape,  characters  and  creatures  is  a  virtual 
economy.  Originally,  virtual  goods  (e.g.,  armor  and 
weapons) and in-game currency are designed to be acquired 
only  through  the  substantial  time  investments,  typically

from several months to even years, thus their acquisition is 
definitely  a  main  goal  of  gamers.  Yet,  these  goods  and 
currencies  can  also  be  sold  to  or  obtained  from  other 
players  via  trade  or  exchange.  Trade  often  leads  gamers 
with limited time for play to rather purchase virtual capital 
(with real money) to enjoy more exciting challenges [1,3]. 
That  is  where  the  business  model  (i.e.,  black  market)  of 
Gold farmers has been established. 
pressure, 
unintended 
Gold farming has been considered malicious by both the 
game  companies  and  the  player  communities  [1,2]  due  to 
the  following  reasons:  (i)  While  in-game  economies  are 
carefully  designed  in  a  way  that  virtual  products  serve  as 
sinks to remove money from circulation, gold farmers and 
buyers  inject  currency  into  the  economy  which  creates 
hyper-inflationary 
arbitrage 
opportunities,  and  other  perverse  incentives  for  market 
agents [1]. (ii) Farmers affect other players’ experiences in 
a  disturbing,  distracting,  malicious,  and  even  illegal  way, 
by  employing  anti-social  computer  scripts  (i.e.,  bots)  to 
automate the farming process, as well as often engaging in 
the  theft  of  account,  ID,  and  financial  information  from 
their  customers  [4].  (iii)  Farming  explicitly  and  unfairly 
violates  the  rules  of  play  and  upsets  the  meritocratic  and 
fantasy-based nature of the games thus potentially driving 
legitimate  players  away  [1].  For  these  reasons,  game 
companies have tried to detect and ban farming accounts.

responses to interactive (often intrusive to users) tests. The 
arms  race  between  game  vendors  and  bot  developers  has

and characterizing gold farmers. We also measure the size 
of  the  free  money  network  as  well  as  in-game  virtual 
economy in terms of the cash flow based on a vast amount 
of  real  data.  We  use  a  set  of  (anonymized)  in-game  trade 
activity logs of AION, collected for one month from one of 
41 independent yet identical game worlds (servers) in 2010. 
2.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
“Trade” in MMORPGs means bartering or buying goods 
with  in-game  money.  Our  conjecture  is  that  free  money 
trade  activities  which  only  give  in-game  money  without 
getting any goods/items in return are likely to be either free 
gifts  among  friends  or  somehow  related  with  real  money 
trading  of  gold  farmers.  Fig.  1(a)  visualizes  all  the  trade 
activities  logged  in  our  dataset  where  nodes  and  edges 
represent  characters  and  trade  activities  among  them, 
respectively. Fig. 1(b) is a subgraph of 1(a) consists of free 
gift  edges  and  related  nodes  only.  Note  that  in  the  AION 
community  there  are  two  character  tribes  (heavenly  vs. 
diabolic)  who  cannot  communicate  with  each  other,  thus 
each tribe forms its own trade clusters. 
To our surprise, while the free money network involves 
with  only  9.7%  (2,884/29,612)  and  1.9%  (4,719/252,859) 
of the nodes and edges (i.e., transactions) in the whole trade 
network, it takes account of 62.2% of the total transaction 
money  during  the  observed  period  ($62,526  out  of  total 
$100,593  when  converted  to  USD).  We  also  observe  that 
Fig.  1(b),  in  particular  the  two  central  clusters,  clearly 
unveils nodes whose interaction graphs look very similar to 
the  typical  cone-shaped  N-to-1  and/or  1-to-N  interaction 
patterns  of  gold  farmers  [1] (see  Fig.  2(b)).  Gold  farming 
networks  mainly  consists  of  (i)  gold  producers  who 
repeatedly  send  free  money  to  only  a  small  number  of 
designated  players  (i.e.,  brokers),  (ii)  brokers  who  collect 
lots  of  free  money  from  many  gold  producers  and  then 
transfer them to buyers at no charge back, and (iii) a lot of 
buyers receiving free  money  from the brokers. This 3-tier 
structure  shown  in  Fig.  2(b)  naturally  comes  from  the 
survival  strategy  of  gold  farmers.  Brokers 
intervene 
between  gold  producers  and  buyers  to  maximize  farming 
efficiency  and  to  establish  the  secrecy  of  their  network. 
Indirect  transactions  also  hide  the  identities  of  high-level 
gold  producers/bots 
that  are,  raised  with  substantial 
investments  of  time,  the  most  valuable  assets  for  gold 
farmers. 
Fig. 2(a) plots the distribution of the ratio of the number 
of incoming edges to that of outgoing edges for the 2,205 
nodes forming the two larger central clusters in  Fig. 1(b).  
Interestingly, we observe that 97.1% of all the nodes have 
either incoming or outgoing edges only. 10.8% and 86.3% 
of the nodes have either outgoing or incoming edges only, 
respectively.  These  uni-directional  edges  are  the  typical 
network-wide  interaction  patterns  of  gold  producers  and 
buyers  shown  in  Fig.  2(b).  The  remaining  2.9%  of  the 
nodes mostly have a lot more number of outgoing edges (to 
buyers)  than  incoming  edges  (from  producers),  which  is 
also the typical interaction pattern of gold brokers.  
To summarize, we have found that (i) 62.2% of the total 
in-game cash flow was of free money, and (ii) 93.4% of the 
free  money  is  highly  likely  to  be  related/connected  with 
real  money  trading,  i.e.,  virtual  black  market.  Our  current 
on-going  work  includes:  (1)  quantifying  accuracy  of  the 
proposed  approach  based  on  the  ground  truth  information 
(e.g., banned accounts), (2) finding out how many new gold 
farmers  our  approach  can  detect  hitherto  impossible,  (3) 
further  in-depth  characterization  of  gold  farmer  networks, 
expanding  our  focus  onto  more  diverse  in-game  social 
relationships  as  well,  and  (4)  comparison  of  the  revealed 
characteristics with those of other in-game normal users as 
well as real-world crime networks like drug trafficking [1] 
or money laundering ones.
