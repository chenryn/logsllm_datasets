User: I have watch a folder that will create a new sub-folder use date as name(e.g 201105124) everyday. I have start a daemon to watch it but if a new sub-folder added, the event in the new sub-folder cannot be trigger. IS that I need to update the watch for the new folder?
Thx for your answer.
Regards
Roy
Assistant: And I find that there is an parameter auto_add in function add_watch,
which can auto add the directory in the watch when it is created.
But it need the event IN_CREATE.
