### Interaction Graphs and Social Networks

#### 5.2 Comparing Social, Visible Interaction, and Latent Interaction Graphs

In this section, we compare the key characteristics of the Renren social graph, visible interaction graph, and latent interaction graph using common graph metrics.

**Degree Distribution:**

Figure 23 illustrates the complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs) of node degrees for the three types of graphs. Since the latent interaction graph is directed, both in-degrees and out-degrees are plotted. In Section 3.4, we demonstrated that latent interactions are more prevalent than visible interactions, which is reflected in the number of edges in the two interaction graphs as shown in Table 3. This also results in a higher degree distribution for nodes in the latent graph compared to the visible interaction graph. However, neither interaction graph has as many edges as the raw social graph, leading to the social graph having the highest degree distribution. Notably, because a small number of Renren users frequently browse profiles (far beyond their circle of friends), the distribution of latent out-degrees flattens at the tail-end and never approaches zero.

Despite these differences, latent interaction graphs still exhibit power-law scaling. Table 3 shows similar in- and out-degree power-law fit alpha values for latent interaction graphs compared to the visible interaction graph and the social graph. Renren limits users to 1,000 friends (2,000 for paying users), so all power-law curves decline quickly to zero, resulting in high alpha values.

**Clustering Coefficient:**

Table 3 indicates that the average clustering coefficient for the latent interaction graph is 0.03, and for the visible interaction graph, it is 0.05, both significantly lower than that of the social graph. This is because not all social links accurately represent active social relationships, and such inactive links are removed in interaction graphs. This leads to loose connections between neighbors and low clustering coefficients in these graphs. A portion of the latent interactions to a profile comes from non-friend strangers who randomly browse the network, further lowering the clustering coefficients in latent interaction graphs.

**Assortativity:**

Table 3 shows that the Renren latent interaction graph is slightly disassortative, which makes sense intuitively, as latent interactions are highly skewed towards a small subset of extremely popular users. In contrast, the other two graphs are assortative, with the social graph being more so. This result contrasts with previous studies where the interaction graph was more assortative than the social graph [29].

**Average Path Length:**

The average path length of the latent interaction graph falls between that of the visible interaction graph and the social graph. As the average number of links per node and the number of high-degree "super-nodes" decrease, the overall level of connectivity in the graph drops, causing average path lengths to rise, especially in the visible interaction graph.

### 6. Impact on Social Applications

In the previous section, we analyzed the key properties of the Renren social, visible interaction, and latent interaction graphs. However, it remains unclear how different graph metrics impact the performance of real-world social applications. Social application tests provide new perspectives since their performance on a particular graph cannot be easily correlated with a single graph metric.

Changes in user connectivity patterns can produce significantly different results for social network applications. To validate the impact of graph choice on socially enhanced applications, we implement techniques from the paper "Efficient Influence Maximization" [6]. This work leverages graph properties in social networks to address information dissemination problems. We compare the effectiveness of these algorithms on the raw social graph, visible interaction graph, and latent interaction graph derived from our Renren measurements of the PKU network. These results allow us to determine whether socially enhanced applications require a model that takes latent interactions into account.

#### 6.1 Efficient Influence Maximization

As online social networks (OSNs) become increasingly popular worldwide, they also become more critical platforms for information dissemination and marketing. Understanding how to fully utilize OSNs as marketing and information dissemination platforms is a significant challenge. The influence maximization problem seeks to identify the most influential individuals who will maximize the spread of information in an OSN.

Given the lack of publicly available social influence datasets, previous work [6, 14] builds statistical models based on raw social graph topologies and designs algorithms to address influence maximization problems within these models.

**Weighted Cascade Model:**

The weighted cascade model relies on social links for information propagation [14]. After receiving information, a user has a single chance to activate each currently inactive neighbor. The activation probability is related to the node's degree: if a person \( w \) has \( d_w \) neighbors, it is activated by neighbors with probability \( \frac{1}{d_w} \). Chen et al. propose instantiating the MixedGreedyWC algorithm to implement the weighted cascade model [6].

**Latent Cascade Model:**

The weighted cascade model is based on social graphs and relies on social relationships plus the activation probability to simulate the information dissemination process. However, we observe that information is not disseminated equally through social links. User profiles are usually only viewed by a small portion of friends, thus not all social links are active in information propagation. Moreover, a portion of the visits to profiles can be attributed to people not connected to the user, i.e., strangers. When a user browses a profile, information in the web page is naturally propagated to that user. It is more accurate to represent information dissemination by links in latent interaction graphs than by passive friendship links in the social graph. Thus, to take latent interaction graphs into account, we define the latent cascade model.

When a person receives information, they have a single chance to activate inactive neighbors, who have directed links pointing to that person in the latent interaction graph. To transform the visitor counts from our month-long measurement into activation probabilities, we calculate the number of unique visitors for every user and determine the most popular user. We then compute the activation probability of every user by normalizing that user’s number of unique visitors by the maximum value. This approximates an activation probability using the "visit rate" normalized to the most popular profile. We use visits from unique users and exclude repeated visits here, because the first visit contributes the most to the information propagation, and repeated follow-up visits are less likely to propagate information.

**Visible Cascade Model:**

The visible cascade model is built atop visible interaction graphs, similar to the latent cascade model. The information dissemination path is decided by visible interaction events, and the per-node activation probability is determined using the same method as in the latent cascade model.

#### 6.2 Experimental Results

For our experiments, we use the MixedGreedyWC algorithm [6] to find the most influential individuals in each of our three models and then compute the number of people influenced. We vary the set of seed users to the MixedGreedyWC algorithm from 1 to 100 in our tests and observe the effects on influence spread.

Figure 24 shows the influence spread versus seed set size for our three models. Influence in the weighted and latent cascade models both increase quickly initially. Eventually, as more seeds are selected, the number of people influenced in the latent cascade model surpasses the weighted model. This is because, although social graphs have a large number of links, the activation probability is generally low, limiting the spread of information to well-connected components of the graph. Conversely, latent interaction graphs, constructed by page viewings, correspond to higher activation probabilities. This aligns with real situations: people are likely to receive information when they browse profiles, while information cannot be disseminated through inactive social links. These high probabilities ensure that information is progressively disseminated through the limited number of links in the latent interaction graph. Previous sections show that visible interaction graphs have the least number of links. Thus, although activation probabilities are relatively high, the visible cascade model reaches the smallest influence spread due to the dearth of links.

### 7. Related Work

Much effort has been put into understanding the structure of large-scale online social networks [8]. Ahn et al. analyze topological characteristics of Cyworld, MySpace, and Orkut [1]. Mislove et al. measure the structure of Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut [22], and observe the growth of the Flickr social network [21]. Java et al. study the topological and geographical properties of Twitter [13]. Huang et al. measure user prestige and visible interaction preference in Renren [12]. To the best of our knowledge, our measurement of the Renren network provides the largest non-Twitter social graph to date, with 42,115,509 users and 1,657,273,875 friendship links. Most of Renren’s topological properties are similar to those of other OSNs, including power-law degree distribution and small-world properties.

Researchers have also studied the visible interaction network. Leskovec et al. analyze the instant messaging network, which contains the largest amount of user conversations ever published [19]. Valafar et al. characterize indirect fan-owner interactions via photos among users in Flickr [27]. Chun et al. observe that visible interactions are almost bidirectional in Cyworld [7]. Wilson et al. show that the structure of the interaction graph differs significantly from the social network in Facebook [29]. Viswanath et al. observe that social links in the activity network tend to come and go quickly over time [28]. Finally, a recent study from Northwestern and UC Santa Barbara quantified the role of spam and phishing attacks in Facebook wall posts [10].

Benevenuto et al. collect detailed click-stream data from a Brazilian social network aggregator and measure silent activities like browsing [3]. Schneider et al. extract click-streams from passively monitored network traffic and make similar measurements [25]. We analyze latent interactions from a different perspective than these existing works by leveraging data intrinsic to the OSN and not inferred from a third-party. Ideally, we would like to perform a detailed comparison between our dataset and prior studies using click-stream datasets. Unfortunately, the sensitive nature of these datasets makes their distribution challenging. At publication time, we are unaware of any publicly available click-stream dataset.

Some researchers have performed initial studies on information propagation and user influence in OSNs. Cha et al. present a detailed analysis of popularity and dissemination of photographs on Flickr [5]. They find that popular users with high in-degree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning subsequent, viral interactions in the form of retweets or mentions on Twitter [4]. Our Renren data confirms these results, as we show that factors like the number of friends and the amount of user-generated content produced are not strongly correlated with popularity.

### 8. Conclusions

Latent user interactions make up the majority of user activity events on OSNs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of both visible and latent user interactions in the Renren OSN. Our data includes detailed visit histories to the profiles of 61,405 Renren users over a 90-day period (September to November 2009). We compute a single visitor history for each profile by using a novel technique to merge visitor logs from multiple consecutive crawls. We analyze profile visit histories to study questions of user popularity and reciprocity for profile browsing behavior, and the link between passive profile browsing and active comments.

Our analysis reveals interesting insights into the nature of user popularity in OSNs. We observe that user behavior changes for latent interactions: more users participate, users do not feel the need to reciprocate visits, and visits by non-friends make up a significant portion of views to most user profiles. We also see that visits to user profiles generate more active interactions (comments) than visits to photos or diary pages. Using profile browsing events, we construct latent interaction graphs as a more accurate representation of meaningful peer interactions. Analysis of latent interaction graphs derived from our Renren data reveals characteristics that fall between visible interaction graphs and social graphs. This confirms the intuition that latent interactions are less limited by constraints such as time and energy but are more meaningful (and thus sparser) than the social graph.

Finally, our measurement study also includes an exhaustive crawl of the largest connected component in the Renren social graph. The resulting graph is one of the biggest of its kind, with more than 42 million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Other than the proprietary Cyworld dataset, this is the only social graph we know of that covers 100% of a large social graph component. Given its size and comprehensiveness, we are currently investigating different options for sharing this dataset with the research community.
