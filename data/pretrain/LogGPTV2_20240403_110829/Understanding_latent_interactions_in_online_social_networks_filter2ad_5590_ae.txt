contain edges between users who are not friends in the social graph.
Our formulation of interaction graphs uses an unweighted graph.
We do not attempt to derive a weight scheme for interaction graphs
analyzed in this paper, but leave exploration of this facet of latent
interaction graphs to future work.
5.2 Comparing Social, Visible Interaction and
Latent Interaction Graphs
In this section we compare the salient characteristics of the Ren-
ren social, visible, and latent interaction graphs using common graph
metrics.
Degree distribution.
Figure 23 plots the CCDFs of node de-
gree for the three types of graphs. Since the latent interaction graph
is directed, we plot both in-degree and out-degree. In Section 3.4
we show that latent interactions are more prevalent than visible in-
teractions. This is reﬂected in the relative number of edges in the
two interaction graphs, as shown in Table 3. This also leads to
nodes in the latent graph having a noticeably higher degree distribu-
tion in Figure 23. However, neither of the interaction graphs have
as many edges as the raw social graph, which leads to the social
graph having the highest degree distribution. Interestingly, because
a small number of Renren users are frequent proﬁle browsers, i.e.
they like to visit a large number of proﬁles (far greater than their
circle of friends), the distribution of latent out-degrees ﬂattens out
at the tail-end and never approaches 0%.
Despite these differences, latent interaction graphs still exhibit
power-law scaling. Table 3 shows similar in- and out-degree power-
law ﬁt alpha values for latent interaction graphs compared to the
visible interaction graph and the social graph. Renren limits users
to of 1,000 friends (2,000 for paying users), so all power-law curves
decline quickly to zero, and alpha values are high.
Clustering coefﬁcient.
Table 3 shows that the average cluster-
ing coefﬁcient is 0.03 for the latent interaction graph, and 0.05 for
the visible interaction graph, which are both much less than that
of the social graph. This is because not all social links are accu-
rate indicators of active social relationships, and these links with
no interactions are removed in interaction graphs. This produces
loose connections between neighbors, and low clustering coefﬁ-
cients in these graphs. A portion of the latent interactions to a pro-
ﬁle is from non-friend strangers who randomly browse the network.
Thus, links between visitors in the latent interaction graph are less
intensive than friends exchanging messages, which further lowers
the clustering coefﬁcients in latent interaction graphs.
Assortativity.
Table 3 shows that the Renren latent interac-
tion graph is slightly disassortative. This makes sense intuitively,
as latent interactions are highly skewed towards a small subset of
extremely popular users. In contrast, the other two graphs are both
assortative, with the social graph being more so. This result con-
trasts with previous studies in which the interaction graph was more
assortative than the social graph [29].
Average path length.
The average path length of the latent
interaction graph is between that of the visible interaction graph
and the social graph. As the average number of links per node
and the number of high-degree “super-nodes” decreases, the overall
level of connectivity in the graph drops. This causes average path
lengths to rise, especially in the visible interaction graph.

IMPACT ON SOCIAL APPLICATIONS
In the previous section, we analyzed salient properties of the
Renren social, visible interaction, and latent interaction graphs.
However, it remains unknown how different graph metrics impact
the performance of real-world social applications. Social appli-
cation tests present new perspectives since their performance on
a particular graph cannot be easily correlated with a single graph
metric.
Changes in user connectivity patterns can produce signiﬁcantly
different results for social network applications. In order to vali-
date how much impact the choice of graphs can make on socially
enhanced applications, we implement techniques from the paper
“Efﬁcient inﬂuence maximization” [6]. This work leverages graph
properties in social networks to address information dissemination
problems. We compare the effectiveness of these algorithms on the
raw social graph, visible interaction graph, and latent interaction
graph that are derived from our Renren measurements of the PKU
network. These results allow us to validate whether socially en-
hanced applications require a model that takes latent interactions
into account.
6.1 Efﬁcient Inﬂuence Maximization
As OSNs become increasingly popular worldwide, they also be-
come more critical platforms for information dissemination and
marketing. Understanding how to fully utilize OSNs as marketing
and information dissemination platforms is a signiﬁcant challenge.
The inﬂuence maximization problem seeks to determine the most
inﬂuential individuals who will maximum the spread of informa-
tion in an OSN.
Given the lack of publicly available social inﬂuence datasets,
previous work [6, 14] builds statistical models based on raw so-
cial graph topologies, and designs algorithms to address inﬂuence
maximization problems within these models.
Weighted cascade model.
The weighted cascade model relies
on social links for information propagation [14]. After receiving
information, a user has a single chance of activating each currently
inactive neighbor. In this model, the activation probability is related
to node’s degree: if a person w has dw neighbors, it is activated by
neighbors with probability 1/dw. Chen et al. propose instantiating
the MixedGreedyWC algorithm to implement the weighted cascade
model [6].
Latent cascade model.
The weighted cascade model is based
on social graphs, and relies on social relationships plus the activa-
tion probability to simulate the information dissemination process.

Figure 24: Inﬂuence spread using the MixedGreedyWC algo-
rithm on different graphs.
However, we observe that information is not disseminated equally
through social links. User proﬁles are usually only viewed by a
small portion of friends, thus not all social links are active in in-
formation propagation. Moreover, a portion of the visits to proﬁles
can be attributed to people not connected to the user, i.e. strangers.
When a user browses a proﬁle, information in the web page is
naturally propagated to that user. It is more accurate to represent
information dissemination by links in latent interaction graphs than
by passive friendship links in the social graph. Thus, to take latent
interaction graphs into account we deﬁne the latent cascade model.
When a person receives information, they have a single chance
to activate inactive neighbors, who have directed links pointing to
that person in the latent interaction graph. To transform the visitor
counts from our month-long measurement into activation proba-
bilities, we calculate the number of unique visitors for every user
and determine the most popular user. We then compute the acti-
vation probability of every user by normalizing that user’s number
of unique visitors by the maximum value. This approximates an
activation probability using the “visit rate” normalized to the most
popular proﬁle. We use visits from unique users and exclude re-
peated visits here, because the ﬁrst visit contributes the most to
the information propagation, and repeated follow-up visits are less
likely to propagate information.
Visible cascade model.
The visible cascade model is built
atop visible interaction graphs, in a similar fashion to the latent
cascade model. The information dissemination path is decided by
visible interaction events, and the per node activation probability is
determined using the same method as in the latent cascade model.
6.2 Experimental Results
For our experiments, we use the MixedGreedyWC algorithm [6]
to ﬁnd the most inﬂuential individuals in each of our three models,
and then compute the number of people inﬂuenced. We vary the
set of seed users to the MixedGreedyWC algorithm from 1 to 100
in our tests and observe the effects on inﬂuence spread.
Figure 24 shows inﬂuence spread versus seed set size for our
three models. Inﬂuence in the weighted and latent cascade model
both increase quickly in the beginning. Eventually, as more seeds
are selected, the number of people inﬂuenced in latent cascade
model surpasses the weighted model. The reason for this is that
although social graphs have a large amount of links, the activation
probability is generally low. This limits the spread of information to
well connected components of the graph. Conversely, latent inter-
action graphs are constructed by page viewings, which correspond
to higher activation probability. This is in accordance with real sit-
uations: people are likely to receive information when they browse
proﬁles, while information cannot be disseminated through inactive
social links. These high probabilities guarantee that information is
progressively disseminated through the limited number of links in
the latent interaction graph. Previous sections show that visible in-
teraction graphs have the least number of links. Thus, although ac-
tivation probabilities are relatively high, the visible cascade model
reaches the smallest inﬂuence spread due to the dearth of links.
7. RELATED WORK
Much effort has been put into understanding the structure of
large-scale online social networks [8]. Ahn et al. analyze topo-
logical characteristics of Cyworld, MySpace and Orkut [1]. Mis-
love et al. measure the structure of Flickr, YouTube, LiveJour-
nal, and Orkut [22], and observe the growth of the Flickr social
network [21]. Java et al. study the topological and geographical
properties of Twitter [13]. Huang et al. measure user prestige
and visible interaction preference in Renren [12]. To the best of
our knowledge, our measurement of the Renren network provides
the largest non-Twitter social graph to date, with 42,115,509 users
and 1,657,273,875 friendship links. Most of Renren’s topological
properties are similar to those of other OSNs, including power-law
degree distribution and small world properties.
Researchers have also studied the visible interaction network.
Leskovec et al. analyze the instant messaging network, which con-
tains the largest amount of user conversations ever published [19].
Valafar et al. characterize indirect fan-owner interactions via pho-
tos among users in Flickr [27]. Chun et al. observe that visible
interactions are almost bidirectional in Cyworld [7]. Wilson et al.
show the structure of the interaction graph differs signiﬁcantly from
the social network in Facebook [29]. Viswanath et al. observe that
social links in the activity network tend to come and go quickly
over time [28]. Finally, a recent study from Northwestern and UC
Santa Barbara quantiﬁed the role of spam and phishing attacks in
Facebook wall posts [10].
Benevenuto et al. collect detailed click-stream data from a Brazil-
ian social network aggregator, and measure silent activities like
browsing [3]. Schneider et al. extract click-streams from passively
monitored network trafﬁc and make similar measurements [25].
We analyze latent interactions from a different perspective than
these existing works by leveraging data that is intrinsic to the OSN
and not inferred from a third-party. Ideally, we would like to per-
form a detailed comparison between our dataset and prior studies
using click-stream datasets. Unfortunately, the sensitive nature of
these datasets make their distribution challenging. At publication
time, we are currently unaware of any publicly available click-
stream dataset.
380Some researchers have performed initial studies on information
propagation and user inﬂuence in OSNs. Cha et al. present a de-
tailed analysis of popularity and dissemination of photographs on
Flickr [5]. They ﬁnd that popular users with high in-degree are not
necessarily inﬂuential in terms of spawning subsequent, viral in-
teractions in the form of retweets or mentions on Twitter [4]. Our
Renren data conﬁrms these results, as we show that factors like
number of friends and amount of user-generated content produced
are not strongly correlated with popularity.
8. CONCLUSIONS
Latent user interactions make up the large majority of user ac-
tivity events on OSNs.
In this paper, we present a comprehen-
sive study of both visible and latent user interactions in the Ren-
ren OSN. Our data includes detailed visit histories to the proﬁles of
61,405 Renren users over a 90-day period (September to November
2009). We compute a single visitor history for each proﬁle by using
a novel technique to merge visitor logs from multiple consecutive
crawls. We analyze proﬁle visit histories to study questions of user
popularity and reciprocity for proﬁle browsing behavior, and the
link between passive proﬁle browsing and active comments.
Our analysis reveals interesting insights into the nature of user
popularity in OSNs. We observe that user behavior changes for la-
tent interactions: more users participate, users do not feel the need
to reciprocate visits, and visits by non-friends make up a signiﬁ-
cant portion of views to most user proﬁles. We also see that visits
to user proﬁles generate more active interactions (comments) than
visits to photos or diary pages. Using proﬁle browsing events, we
construct latent interaction graphs as a more accurate representa-
tion of meaningful peer interactions. Analysis of latent interaction
graphs derived from our Renren data reveal characteristics that fall
between visible interaction graphs and social graphs. This conﬁrms
the intuition that latent interactions are less limited by constraints
such as time and energy, but more meaningful (and thus sparser)
than the social graph.
Finally, our measurement study also includes an exhaustive crawl
of the largest connected component in the Renren social graph. The
resulting graph is one of the biggest of its kind, with more than 42
million nodes and 1.6 billion edges. Other than the proprietary Cy-
world dataset, this is the only social graph we know of that covers
100% of a large social graph component. Given its size and com-
prehensiveness, we are currently investigating different options for
sharing this dataset with the research community.
