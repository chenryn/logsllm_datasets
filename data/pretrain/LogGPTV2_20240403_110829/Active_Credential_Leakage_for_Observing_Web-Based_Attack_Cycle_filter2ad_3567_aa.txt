Directing traffic to cash in on referrals is a  
common and legitimate method of making  
money on the Internet. It should not, therefore,  
be surprising for the same to be true in the  
illegitimate world of cybercrime. So-called  
traffic direction systems (TDSs) have  
reached a high level of sophistication.  
This research paper will show how such  
systems work, how these are utilized by  
cybercriminals, and what the security  
industry can do about this.
First, we will take a look at how TDSs work by looking at HTTP header redirection. 
Then we will look at and compare how TDSs use iframes and Flash-based applications 
to distribute malware.
Cybercriminals try to maximize the effectiveness of TDSs in order to profit as much as 
possible from their exploits. This paper will also show how time, region, and installed 
software influence TDSs by looking at the various tools that are currently available in 
the market.
Cybercriminals strongly utilize TDSs to determine traffic type, which will aid them in 
directing users to certain malicious sites and in determining what malicious payloads 
to execute on particular systems. Some malware may also be the end result of a 
particular TDS’s series of redirections, making it a malware infection vector.
What then can we do as part of the security industry?
TDSs present several challenges with regard to malware sample sourcing and 
malicious URL detection, as these are capable of detecting the use of security 
tools and often initiate avoidance tactics. A naïve approach to looking at TDSs may, 
therefore, result in bogus findings and possible damage to the systems of innocent 
users. This paper will show how we can protect users by actively detecting and 
blocking the TDSs they may be entangled in.

web TRaffic
In this research paper, “traffic” refers to high-level activities such as clicking a link but 
not to low-level traffic that travels through network switches and cables. In other words, 
it will talk about “web traffic.”
Web traffic is usually initiated by users via the use of web browsers. It begins with 
a click to access a URL. Traffic flow starts with a mouse click, which sends browser 
information to a server that uses predetermined rules and methods to obtain user 
browser requests. Based on these rules, the server then decides what action  
is needed.
Dispatching web traffic is now widely used on the Internet to direct unknowing users to 
hover over an embedded iframe on a site. The continuous increase of Internet users 
each year is motivating online shop, gambling site, and botnet owners to take control of 
users’ moves to point them to their sites.

samPle TDs Technical analysis
Several means to redirect traffic exist, some of which are only used to redirect targeted 
users of very popular software or applications. However, all web traffic redirection 
techniques intend to lead unknowing users to a certain site. The following are some of 
the more well-known web traffic redirection techniques:
iframe redirection
•  Server-side redirection
•  Refresh meta tag and HTTP refresh header redirection
• 
•	 Flash-based redirection
•  Video redirection
•  Simple or complicated TDS redirection
Websites or web servers behave differently based on users’ system settings. If a 
transnational company has several sites, localization servers are identified by the 
number l10n	while internationalization servers are identified by the number i18n.	This 
means that users first contact some kind of script in the middle and, depending on their 
web client information, they are redirected to the right sites.
Some sites lead users to different site sections or to totally different sites, depending 
on certain web client information. A good example of these is a huge corporation’s site 
that points users to the right pages, depending on their systems’ language settings, OS 
types, and browsers.
Figure 1 shows how a huge corporation’s site in the middle points users from the main 
site to localized versions.
Figure 1. Site	in	the	middle	behavior
The site in the middle can, however, be more complicated than that shown in Figure 1. 
It can use additional modules to process user requests based on certain information 
and to make a multi-optional selection in order to know what server the user should be 
directed to.

Some sites use more sophisticated methods in order to attract clicks and to direct 
users to the proper locations via databases and additional interfaces that help control 
traffic called TDSs (see Figure 2). Databases, redirection gateways, logging information 
storage devices, and web interfaces control all possible redirection means in TDSs.
Figure 2. Structure	of	sites	that	use	TDSs
A TDS requires additional file storage devices for logs and web browser functionality 
components that support mod_rewrite-like procedures.
TDSs serve a wide range of functions such as selling pharmaceutical products, 
exploiting system vulnerabilities using malicious codes, executing SMS games, 
redirecting unsuspecting users to adult sites, instigating blackhat search engine 
optimization (SEO) attacks, and others.

TDs funcTionaliTy
Traffic Direction
Most of the current known TDS set-ups have almost the same functionality to help their 
owners control web traffic. A TDS’s functions can be categorized into three types—
controlling traffic direction, filtering unwanted traffic, and collecting traffic statistics.
Controlling traffic direction is the most important and primary function of a TDS. To 
control web traffic direction, a TDS can use the dimensions in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Dimensions	that	TDSs	use
The TDS dimensions in Figure 3 have the following components:
1.	 Browser	(user	agent):	This refers to a web browser’s version and its equivalent 
version as delivered by the web agent (browser) to the web server. This 
information, of course, can easily be spoofed but most Internet users use their 
browsers as is, making the user-agent information a TDS gathers relevant in  
most cases.
2.	 OS:	This refers to the OS’s version and its equivalent version as delivered by the 
web agent (browser) to the web server.
3.	 IP	geolocation:	Based on a web agent’s IP address, a TDS can easily determine 
where the user is originally from. Lists of the geographic locations of IP addresses 
are offered as downloadable databases by various companies. These are primarily 
used to obtain information on their owners’ physical geographic locations. Privately 
owned companies that collect this kind of information from “open” sources 
normalize it. They usually offer this data for free or for a minimal fee if it comes with 
additional information such as each user’s region and city as well as daily updates.
4.	 Time	frame:	This is important so that TDS owners can gauge at what exact times 
they can monetize user clicks. This parameter is highly used by the owners of adult 
and pharmaceutical sites. It helps TDS owners determine when each user is most 
likely to click objects that lead to their sites and to be tempted to buy their bogus 
products or services.
5.	 Referral:	This specifies where a user came from and what referral information 
filtering application the TDS should use. It controls where a user should be taken 
to, depending on where he/she originated. Technically, it is used by partner and 
affiliate programs to calculate how many clicks each particular redirector made.
6.	 Web	agent	local	language	settings:	These are the most widely used parameters 
in filtering and directing web traffic for malware distribution, for adult and gambling 
site redirection, and for other applications. These help TDS owners determine what 
language a user prefers so he/she can be directed to the proper localized site.

Traffic Filtering
Filtering unwanted traffic is another important functionality that TDS owners use to filter 
unwanted or dangerous web traffic from their sites or to keep their systems hidden 
from security companies’ search engine crawlers. Traffic filtering is implemented based 
on the same information used for directing traffic and works in almost the same way. 
Unlike traffic direction, however, traffic filtering directs most of the unwanted traffic to 
the most popular sites (see Figure 4).
Figure 4. Traffic	filtering	functionality’s	structure.
Figure 4 shows that web traffic is usually filtered then directed from the very beginning 
while writing information to a database or a text file at the same time for future 
statistical means. TDS owners that use the traffic filtering functionality usually redirect 
unwanted requests to the most popular legitimate sites in order to hide their systems’ 
main function. For example, security companies that scan lists of possibly malicious 
URLs and IP addresses are filtered by malicious TDS owners to block the HTTP 
requests of antivirus crawlers. This instead directs security experts to nonmalicious 
legitimate sites such as Yahoo!	and Google.

Every TDS owner primarily wants to direct  
web traffic without losing it. To do so, they  
need to use several instruments that were  
primarily developed to gather and direct  
traffic to wherever they want (see  
Figure 5). Most of the software designed  
for controlling web traffic consists of  
server-side scripting applications. In some  
cases, these use databases as storage  
devices for control rules and for  
logging information.
IL TDS
Figure 5. Additional	TDS	modules
IL	TDS	was developed by the online SEO community known as “FreeIl.net” in 2009. A 
modified version was released in 2010. IL	TDS	is primarily used in SEO although it has 
also been used for malware distribution.
Simple TDS
Simple	TDS	is widely used for SEO as well as for small- and medium-scale pay-per-
install (PPI) projects. Many adult or pornographic and online shop sites use it as well. It 
is interesting to note that Simple	TDS	was developed in late 2008, after which its owner 
ceased development. Some traffic and SEO activists continued developing concurrent 
versions using the original code base. Most of the Simple	TDS	versions used for traffic 
direction nowadays are probably post-development projects.
Sutra TDS
Sutra	TDS	is currently the most advanced and most powerful TDS software with the 
ability to process millions of requests per day. It was designed to process a significant 
number of logs in real time in order to tune up redirection rules. It was developed in 
2003 and has been constantly updated since then, hence the stable releases to date. It 
is unique in that it uses a combination of FastCGI	and a self-developed C	code without 
affecting the infrastructure of its database. As such, it can be deployed on almost any 
kind of low-end server while still being able to process up to 30 million clicks every 24 
hours. It can come with an additional module called “TS,”	which serves as an interface 
that emulates traffic market functionality and as a base for partner or affiliate programs. 
Its and TS’s	code owner also offers additional services for VPN tunneling and for traffic 
reselling. Sutra	TDS	3.4	is the software’s latest version, which is sold for between 
US$100 and US$130, depending on a buyer’s preferred configuration.
Advanced TDS
Advanced	TDS	has almost the same functionality as Simple	TDS.	However, it also 
comes with a unique advanced feature—two-layer traffic filtering. Its entire engine 
was written in PHP	using MySQL	as data storage device and requires the use of Zend	
Optimizer	for significant server loads. Its development has been discontinued and its 
current versions are no longer supported, although it is still sold for a 1% share of the 
total amount of traffic the owner gets.

Kallisto TDS
The most interesting function of Kallisto	TDS	is its ability to hide TDS references 
using a JavaScript pop-up. It was developed in 2007 and was first sold for US$100 
in underground forums. In 2008, its owner made its source code public and stopped 
further development.
CrazyTDS
CrazyTDS	is one of the cheapest TDS solutions priced at US$8.50. Its latest 
version—1.3—was released in March 2010. A new version—2.0—is also about to come 
out. Its functions are similar to most TDS software and support most of the commonly 
used TDS filtering combinations. It also boasts of a one-click installation process,
