User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Make other VMs show in Network on windows server in Azure I'm deploying a desktop app that connects to a remote database.  standard 2-tier setup, but it's not a web app.  People will log in via RemoteApp.  But I'm having trouble getting the app instances in RemoteApp to connect to the server.

There are 2 Azure VMs, each with windows 2008 R2.  I read that if you put them in the same service, I wouldn't need a virtual network, so I did that.  Each machine could ping the other, but with I go in Explorer and click on Network, all I see is tsclient and there the other machine is not there.

So I created 2 more VMs, this time in separate services, but with a virtual network.  Again the machines can ping eachother base on the 192.168.... ip, but they don't show up on the network.

I already turned on "network discovery" for both, and I make the local network a "Work" network.  

What do you have to do to get VMs in Azure so see each other on the network.  The app is supposed to refer to the database like \vmhost2\MSSQLEXPRESS  so I'm trying to get the vm to show up in the network, as a named host computer.

Assistant: Turn on Computer Browser for each box you want to see and they will show up in a few minutes.
