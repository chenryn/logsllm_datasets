# iMacros Script for Data Parsing and Form Submission

## Overview
This script demonstrates how to use iMacros to parse data, open a new tab for parsing software, and submit the parsed data into a form. The example is simplified but can be extended to handle loops (CSV rows) and multiple data fields (CSV columns).

## Script

### Save Webpage to File System
```plaintext
#01
SAVEAS TYPE=HTM FOLDER=* FILE=PARSE_FILE.html
```

### Open New Tab for Parsing Software
```plaintext
#03
TAB OPEN
#04
TAB T=2
#05
URL GOTO=http://localhost/defcon17/simple_parse.php
```

### Read Parsed Results and Submit Form
```plaintext
#08
TAB T=1
#09
CMDLINE !DATASOURCE data.csv
#10
SET !DATASOURCE_COLUMNS 1
#11
SET !DATASOURCE_LINE {{!LOOP}}
#12
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:simple_form ATTR=NAME:access_code CONTENT={{!COL1}}
#13
WAIT SECONDS=5
#14
TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:SUBMIT FORM=NAME:simple_form ATTR=NAME:save&&VALUE:Save
```

## Explanation
1. **Save Webpage to File System**: Saves the current webpage as `PARSE_FILE.html`.
2. **Open New Tab for Parsing Software**: Opens a new tab and navigates to the local parsing software.
3. **Read Parsed Results and Submit Form**:
   - Switches back to the first tab.
   - Sets the data source to `data.csv` and configures it to read one column.
   - Iterates through each line of the CSV file.
   - Fills the form with the data from the CSV.
   - Waits for 5 seconds.
   - Submits the form.

## Advanced Features
Using additional tabs to run local programs facilitates advanced features not possible in traditional iMacros configurations, such as:
- Interrupted macros
- Parsing data from pages and acting on results
- Interfacing with local peripherals
- Changing proxy settings
- Aggregating data from multiple websites
- Uploading data in mid-macro

## ReCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA Solving Services
ReCAPTCHA is a widely used CAPTCHA service that digitizes old manuscripts. There are also CAPTCHA solving services (APIs) that solve CAPTCHAs by real people, providing a solution for web scraping and automation tasks.

### ReCAPTCHA Details
- 250 million CAPTCHAs executed daily
- Free CAPTCHA service
- 30 million CAPTCHAs solved daily
- CAPTCHA words are scanned from old manuscripts
- Solved CAPTCHAs help digitize these manuscripts

### CAPTCHA Solving Process
1. CAPTCHA displayed on the web page.
2. CAPTCHA image sent to a solving service.
3. CAPTCHA solved by a human.
4. Embedded text sent back to the requestor.
5. Text entered in the CAPTCHA textbox.
6. CAPTCHA solved!

## Conclusion
- Reviewed traditional scraper theory.
- Described web design technologies and techniques that create difficult cases for webbot/screen scraper developers.
- Demonstrated that iMacros can solve most (if not all) difficult cases through absolute browser emulation and complete control (through hacks).
- Looked at managing large-scale deployments.
