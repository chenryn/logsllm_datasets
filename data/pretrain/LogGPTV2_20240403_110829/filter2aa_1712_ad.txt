In conclusion
Review of traditional scraper theory
Described web design technologies and techniques
that create “difficult cases” for webbot/screen 
scraper developers
Saw that iMacros can solve most (all) difficult cases 
by:
Absolute browser emulation
Complete control (through hacks)
Looked at managing large scale deployments
