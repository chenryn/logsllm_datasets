## Question
    4.1.0
        org.apache.shardingsphere
        sharding-jdbc-spring-boot-starter
        ${sharding-jdbc.version}
### mysql version
    show variables like '%version%';
    INSERT INTO MY_TABLE(Variable_name, Value) VALUES ('version', '8.0.18');
### question
I use mybatis and shardingsphere in my project.  
This is my sql
    select *
    from (select user_id as userId, rank_value as rankValue, row_number() over (order by rank_value desc) as seq
          from t_stat_rank_day
          where rank_type = 1
            and rank_day = '2020-10-16'
          order by rank_value desc, update_time
          limit 50) as go
    where go.userId = 1594371406316000000;
But something error happens:
    line 2:14 no viable alternative at input '(selectrow_number()over'
    line 2:14 no viable alternative at input '(selectrow_number()over'
    line 2:11 extraneous input '(' expecting ')'

I want to get the rank by using `row_number`, even if I use another way for
example
    select *
    from (select a.*, @rank := @rank + 1 As seq
          from (select @rank := 0, user_id, rank_value as rankValue
                from hoho_trade.t_stat_rank_day
                where rank_type = 1
                  and rank_day = '2020-10-15'
                order by rank_value desc, update_time
                limit 50) as a
         ) b
    where user_id = 1594371406316000000;
That appears the same mismatch error.  
What can I do?  
Thanks sincerely!
