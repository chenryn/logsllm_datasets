## Abstract

The increasing frequency of network attacks poses significant challenges for both network operators and users. Consequently, the detection of anomalous traffic is a critical aspect of IP network management. This issue becomes even more complex when considering backbone networks, which impose stringent performance requirements.

In recent years, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has emerged as a promising technique for detecting a wide range of network anomalies. PCA is a dimensionality-reduction method that reduces the number of variables in a dataset while preserving most of the original variability. The original data are projected onto new axes, known as Principal Components (PCs). Each PC captures the direction of maximum variance in the data, given the variance already accounted for by the preceding components.

In this work, we have developed an anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using PCA. Our approach builds on the work of Lakhina et al. [1], [2], who used PCA to decompose traffic variations into normal and anomalous components, thereby identifying anomalies when the anomalous components exceed a predefined threshold. However, our method introduces several innovations that significantly enhance system performance.

Firstly, we analyze traffic at four distinct aggregation levels: ingress router, origin-destination flows, input link, and random aggregation via sketches. This multi-level approach helps detect anomalies that might be obscured at a single aggregation level. Additionally, we have introduced a novel method for identifying specific anomalous flows within these aggregates, a capability not present in previous works.

Secondly, our system applies PCA at different time scales, enabling the detection of both sudden (e.g., bursty) and gradual (e.g., increasing rate) anomalies, which cannot be effectively identified at a single time scale.

Finally, we have incorporated both entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence to detect anomalous behavior, demonstrating that this combination results in better performance and greater stability.

## System Architecture

Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed system. The process begins with the collection of Netflow data, which is then formatted and aggregated at various levels. Time-series data are constructed, and metrics such as entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence are computed. Principal Components (PCs) are then calculated, and the system uses these components to detect and identify anomalies.

## Experimental Evaluation

The proposed system was tested using a publicly available dataset from the Abilene/Internet2 Network [3], a hybrid optical and packet network used by the U.S. research and education community. Since the dataset does not include ground truth labels, we performed a partial manual verification of the data, focusing on the traces where the system detected the largest anomalies. We also synthetically added some anomalies, primarily representative of DoS and DDoS attacks, to validate the system's performance. The results showed that the implemented system successfully detected all synthetic anomalies, indicating its effectiveness.
