* IOS/IEC standard 10587:2002, initially for OSI networks
* Dijkstra/SPF
* Low dependence on ISO protocols
* Uses NSAP for router identity, area membership, adj
* Provides L1 and L2 routing
* Messages in data-link frames
* Adj and address info in TLVs
* For a new AF, define new TLV with existing topology
* RFC 1195 for IP routing along with OSI in single instance (Integrated IS-IS)
# OSI Network Layer and addressing
* ISO created protocol specs for each OSI layer
* Many used in telecoms equipment and aviation
* End System (ES) - Host
* Intermediate System - Router
* System - Network node
* Circuit - Interface
* Domain - AS
* ES-ES uses connectionless and connection mode network layer comms
* Connectionless like IP (datagram service without session establishments)
* L3 proto between ES is CLNP (Connectionless Network Protocol)
 * ISO/IEC8473-1:1998
 * Services by CLNP are CLNS
* Connection orientated adapted from X.25
* NSAP address for both modes, IOS/IEC8348
* NSAP for entire network node
* No interface subnets
* Basic address format is IDP (Initial Domain Part) and DSP (Domain Specific Part)
* Variable format and length (application dependent)
* Address has variable length
**IDP and AFI**
* Two fields, Authority and Format Identifer (AFI) and Initial Domain Identifier (IDI)
* AFI is format of address fields
* IDI variable length based on AFI
* AFI and IDI indicate routing domain for node
**DSP**
* Depends on address format
* Variable length HO-DSP (High Order DSP)
 * Area/part node is in
* Subfields of this
 * System ID - unique to node, 1 to 8 octets long, but usually fixed at 6
 * SEL (NSAP Selector/NSELF), 1 octet, service/network layer on node that should process packet
* 49 is locally defined
* Usually, AFI of 49, length and meaning of HO-DSP admi ndefined
* Minimum NSAP is 8 octets, with AFI, Sys ID and SEL. Max is 20
* If SEL 0, entire address identifiers dest node
* NSAP with SEL 0 is Network Entity Title (NET)
* Dots or no dots doesnt matter
 * Cisco sets to 49.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.00 by default
* L2 of interface is SNAP (Sub Network Point Of Attachment)
* IS enumerates interfaces with local 1 octet number, local circuit ID, increments by 1 for every int, begins at 0 for cisco
## OSI Routing Levels
* 0 - ES-ES or ES-IS
* 1 - ES in single area
* 2 - ES in different areas
* 3 - ES in different domains
* Period hellos from ES to IS to discover nearest IS
 * ESH for ES
 * ISH for IS
* L1 - Intra area routing
* Collects list of ESs attached, advertises list to each other
* L2 - Inter area
* No list of connected ES
* Area prefixes exchanged to learn how to reach areas
* If IS sees packet of ES in different area, forwards to closest L2 capable IS
* Packet forwarded by L2-capable IS until destination
* L1 is routing by system ID
* L2 routing by area
* L2 is backbone of domain
* L3 similar to BGP. As BGP-MP exists, and can carry NSAP, OSI IDRP (Interdomain Routing Protocol) replaced with BGP
## Metrics, Levels, Adj
* Default - Required by all IS-IS imps, usually bandwidth, higher worse
* Delay - Transit delay on link
* Expense - monetary
* Error - Residual bit error
* All above calc 4 different SPF trees
* Default usually only one supported
* Default metric 10, no matter bandwidth
* **isis metric** *metric [level]* - Per int
* Original spec defined link and metric to be 6 bytes wide
* Range of 1-63, path metrics 10 bits wide (1-1023)
* Wide metrics expand, 24 bits per int, 32 per path
* Separate LSDB per routing level
* For each level, router originates LSP (Link State PDU)
* Similar to LSU
* L1 and L2 LSPs describe adj at each level
* LSPs never leak between L1 and L2 databases
 * Can inject routes in a controlled way between the two
## IS-IS Packet Types
* Hello
* LSP
* CSNP
* PSNP
### Hello
* IIH
* Separate sent for L1 and L2 adj on b'cast
* L1L2 (or P2P) hello on P2P links
* 10s hello time default, 1-65535 range
* **isis hello-interval seconds [level]**
* Hold down multiplier of hello, default 3
* **isis hello-multiplier multiplier [level]**
* Don't need to match between neighbours
* DIS is one third of config'd timers
 * 3 1/3s hello
 * 10 hold
 * Detects DIS outage quicker
### LSPs
* Advertising routing info
* Smallest standlone element of LSDB is entire LSP
* No different types, distinct TLVs inside LSP instead
Identified by: -
* System ID of originator (6 octets)
* Pseudonode ID, differentiates between LSP describing router, and LSP for multiaccess networks in which router a DIS (1 octet)
* LSP number - Fragment number of LSP (1 octet)
* Triplet is LSPID
* For LSPs describing router themselves, PSID is 0
* Seq nuymber is 32 bit
* Start 0X00000001
* End 0xFFFFFFFF
* Modification increments
* Highest seq most recent
* Similar to OSPF, but no wrapover
* Originating router would need to turn off for LSP to expire, or change Sys ID
* Would take 136 years for an LSP every second changing to reach this
* LSP remaining lifetime
* 1200 seconds default (20m)
* IS-IS routers refresh LSPs every 15m
* LSP body deleted after lifetime
* Advertises empty LSP with lifetime 0 (LSP purge)
* No flushing yet, ZeroAgeLifetime of 60s first
* Ensures header retains until all neighbours have seen it
* Ciscos hold empty LSP header for another 20m
* MTU limits payload size
* Frag required
* Same Sys and PSID
* Frag number increments, starts at 0
* Frag only by originating router
 * Means end to end MTU must be no smaller than routers into network
Inside LSP: -
* Adj to neighbour routers or networks
* Intra/Inter Area prefixes
* External prefixes
* Address info about all in LSP of each router connected to that network
* Topology info about network and connected routers from Pseudonode LSP
* Gen'd by DIS on ma network
* IS-IS router on a level gen's 1 LSP describing itself and topology info, plus a PS LSP for each network its a DIS in
* Unique ID of LSP as a whole
* Can be flooded, requested, ack'd, refreshed, aged and flushed
* When any topology or addressing change, LSP needs to be regend
* Very few LSPs rather than multiple LSAs, so few required to refresh
* All topology/address info in TLVs
* Routers process those they know, ignore those it doesnt
### CSNP and PSNP
* Syncs LDPs
* Seq number refers to range of LSPID values about set of LSPs that packets carry inf about
* Not seq number of individual LSPs
* CSNPs like DBDs
* Complete list of LSPs in senders LSDB
* Rx router compares own LSDB to CSNP and acts (floods missing, or requests missing)
* Multiple CSNPs sent if filled MTU
* Individual LSPIDs advertised sorted as integer numbers
* Each CSNP has start LSPID and End LSPID
* Full range starts with 0000.0000.0000.00-00 (first 3 octets are sys ID, next is PSID, octet after dash is LSPID)
* Ends with FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FF-FF
* If more than one, ends as last in CSNP
* PSNP similar to LSR and LSA
* Requests an LSP or acks arrival
* Can req or ack multiple LSPs
* No start or end
* On P2P, req's and acks
* On b'cast, PSNP request, ack'd with CSNP by DIS
* Native on b'cast and P2P
* Try to use P2P instead of hub-spoke or p2mp
* Broadcast links known as multiaccess links in IS-IS
* Does not care about data link capability
* Just wants mulitple neighbours to be reached over same interface
**Three Adj States**
* Down - No IIH from neighbour
* Initializing - IIH from neighbour, not certan neighbours receiving this routers IIH
* Up - IIH form nei, certain neighbour receiving own IIH
### Operation over P2P
* Expects single neighbor
* Brings up adj
* Syncs LSDB
* Original spec assumed adj possible moment P2P IIH rx'd
* No bidi check
* RFC 3373 (then 5303) added three way handshake
* Each router has LCIDs
* LCID on P2P appear only in IIH, detects change in identity on other end
* On b'cast, LCID is PSID if router is DIS on interface
* LCID unique only for b'cast
* LCIDs of b'cast and p2p do not clash
* 256 LCIDS were available, three way added Extended LCID (4 octets long)
* Auto assigned, used only for three way handshake
Adj State TLV has following fields: -
* Adj Three Way State - State as seen by sender
* Extended LCID - Sending router ints LCID
* Neighbour Sys ID - Received IIH sys ID
* Neighbour Extended LCID
Early implementation: -
1. If router receives IIH with Three way state down, Router A hears B, B might not hear A. State send of Initializing in IIH
2. B sees state initializing, knows own IIH successful, sends with state up
3. When A sees IIH with Up, bidi confirmed, seends IIH with up
Default o Cisco, configured with **isis three-way-handshake cisco** int
* If on FR or ATM VC, VC could be switched towards another neighbour with sub int going down
