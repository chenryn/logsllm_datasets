**Describe the feature and the current behavior/state.**  
Deformable Convolutional
Network(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06211.pdf,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06211.pdf)
has achieved good results in the du detection task.But the current version of
Tensorflow (1.12)does not seem to implement deformable convolution
operations.The efficiency of some third-party implementations of deformable
convolution operations is lower than that of the mxnet
version(https://github.com/msracver/Deformable-ConvNets).I hope that
Tensorflow can add native deformable convolution operations in future
versions.  
Thanks.  
**Will this change the current api? How?**  
Yes,Add a new API  
**Who will benefit with this feature?**  
Anyone who wants to use Tensorflow for object detection
