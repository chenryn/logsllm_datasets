User: Please describe the centralized and distributed log collection solutions, what are their advantages and disadvantages?
Assistant: The centralized log collection solution is to centrally store all application logs on a central log server for management and analysis. The advantage of this solution is centralized management, unified maintenance, and easy log search and analysis; the disadvantage is that the risk of single point failure is high, network transmission becomes a bottleneck, and scalability is limited. The distributed log collection scheme is to install an agent program on each application node, and collect logs to a distributed log storage server for management and analysis. The advantage of this solution is that it can effectively eliminate the risk of single point of failure, high transmission efficiency, and easy expansion; the disadvantage is that the cost is high, and the unified use of standardized protocols for text logs in a distributed environment is difficult to achieve.
