Question: A web application you are testing employs a highly structured username policy, which makes it susceptible to account enumeration. As part of the remediation process, how should the application handle error messages during the login process to best prevent account enumeration?
"A": "Return a unique error message when the username exists but the password is incorrect, and a different message when both are incorrect.",
"B": "Always return a generic 'Login failed' message regardless of whether the username exists or not.",
"C": "Display a 'Username does not exist' message for invalid usernames to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames.",
"D": "Implement a delay after a certain number of failed login attempts to slow down automated enumeration attempts."
Answer: B
