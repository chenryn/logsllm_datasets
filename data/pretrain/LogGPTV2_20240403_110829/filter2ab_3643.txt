**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Cloud Account Discovery

**Description:**
Adversaries may attempt to enumerate cloud accounts within an organization's environment. Cloud accounts are typically created and configured by the organization for various purposes, such as user access, remote support, service integration, or administration of resources within a cloud service provider (CSP) or Software as a Service (SaaS) application. By discovering these accounts, adversaries can gain insights into the structure and permissions of the cloud environment, which can be leveraged for further malicious activities.
