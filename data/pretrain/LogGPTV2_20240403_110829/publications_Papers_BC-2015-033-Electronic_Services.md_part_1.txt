Amazon.comisknownbymostpeopleasthelargeste-commercewebsitewhich
sells books and other goods. Less known is the fact that Amazon has close to
1.000.000servers. Whysomanycomputers? Tosupportmillionsofcustomers,
Amazon had to build a massive storage and computing infrastructure with high
availabilityandfailureresistancetooperateitswebstore. Oncetheinfrastructure
was built, it became clear that it could be exploited as a commodity by selling
serviceswhichwouldbebilledbasedontheirusage. Theplatformwasofficially
launchedin2006andnamedAmazonWebServices(AWS).Nowadays,AWSisre-
sponsibleforprovidingservicestowell-knownwebcompaniessuchasFoursquare,
AirB&B,Netflix,Pinterest,Reddit,andSpotify.

AWSoffersmorethan40proprietarywebservicesrangingfrome-mailservices
to sophisticated database services. For example, Amazon SimpleDB provides
a highly available and flexible non-relational data store. Amazon Glacier is an
extremelylow-coststorageservicethatprovidessecureanddurabledataarchiving

2.1 Perspectives on Services
Already in 1968, Fuchs [1] presented a study that clearly indicated that the fu-
tureemploymentgrowthwouldbealmostentirelyabsorbedbyserviceindustries.
Nowadays,themostdevelopedcountrieshavebecomeservice-basedeconomies
in terms of the distribution of people employed. While the first services were
certainlydeliveredbyhumanstohumans,theadvancesincomputersystemsover

andcommunicationtechnology(ICT)hassignificantlycontributedtotheevolu-
tionofservices. Overtheyears,eachwaveofinnovationhascreatedsolutionsto

2.2.1 TowardsAutomationandSelfservice
Intheoldtimes,mostservicesweredeliveredbyhumanresources. Asthecostsof
laborincreasedinindustrializedcountries,companieswereseekingfornewways
todeliverserviceswithlesshumaninvolvement. Theanswerwasautomation.
Automation
Themanufacturingindustryhadalreadyintroducedautomationintheirproduction
processesintheearly20th century. Atthesametime,thefirstmodern(mechani-
cal)vendingmachineswereintroducedforstamps,postcards,tickets,cigarettes,
chewinggum,orcandy. Thevendingmachinesautomatethesalesprocess,sothat
nosalespersonnelarerequiredanymore. Intelephony,modernswitchingsystems
wereinventedtoallowthecallertodirectlydialandautomaticallygetroutedtothe
desiredtelephonenumber. Thiswaspreviouslyonlypossiblewiththeassistance
of a telephone operator. After automation, hardly any operator assistance was
required.
Selfservice
Alloftheseserviceautomationexampleshaveincommonthatthepersondelivering
the service was replaced by a machine and the customer took over the role of
thetraditionalserviceperson. Thiswasthebeginningofself-serviceasadirect
consequenceofserviceautomation. Evenifnotallcustomersacceptedselfservices

Technology-generatedServices
Intechnology-generatedservices(Figure2.3.e),thetaskofahumanserviceprovider
is completely replaced by technology. The customer uses the service in a self-
service mode. Technology can be mechanical (vending machine), a mixture of
mechanical and electronic devices (ATM, check-in kiosk), or purely electronic
(homebanking). Inthecontextofservices,theterms“electronical”or“electronic”
arelessrelatedwithtransistors,diodes,orintegratedcircuits-theymainlyreferto

E-mail assisted $5
Chat assisted $7
Phone assisted $5.5
Table2.1: Thecostsofselfservicesandassistedservices
Technology-generated services are gaining a wide acceptance amount com-
panies and governmental agencies for three main reasons. First, self services
aregenerallycost-reducers. Inmanycases,acustomerself-serviceinteractionis
approximately 1/20th of the cost of a telephone call. A Yankee Group research
report1indicatesthat,withinself-servicechannels,theweb-basedself-servicecosts
just $0.24 for an interaction and $0.45 for an interactive voice response (IVR),
asopposedto$5.50foracustomerservicerepresentativeassistedinteractionvia
thetelephone(Table2.1). Second,selfservicecanimprovecustomerexperience
by providing a broad spectrum of choices. Nowadays, the number of features
available to e-banking customers has never been so wide. Customers can trade
stocks,downloadbankstatements,andmakebillpayments. Somefeaturesmay
evenonlybeavailableusingaself-servicemode. Third,selfservicecanprovide
