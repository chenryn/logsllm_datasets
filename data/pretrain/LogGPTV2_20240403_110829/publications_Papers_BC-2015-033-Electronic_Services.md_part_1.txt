### 2 — Electronic Services

#### Summary
This chapter provides an overview of two key streams that have driven and supported the evolution of electronic services: the automation of activities and programming paradigms. These services are implemented using important elements from the fields of automation and programming. The chapter presents several classifications to understand the nature of services from different perspectives. Since services can take various forms, the chapter explains and contrasts electronic services, web services, cloud services, the Internet of Services, and service-oriented architectures.

#### Learning Objectives
1. Describe the evolution of electronic services as a result of the automation of economic activities and self-service.
2. Explain the evolution of electronic services through the improvement of programming paradigms.
3. Classify service systems based on the role of information technology, service architectures, strategies, and business models.

#### Opening Case: Amazon Web Services
**Amazon Embraces SOAP and REST Web Services**
Amazon.com is widely known as the largest e-commerce website, selling books and other goods. Less well-known is the fact that Amazon has nearly one million servers. Why so many computers? To support millions of customers, Amazon had to build a massive storage and computing infrastructure with high availability and failure resistance to operate its web store. Once the infrastructure was built, it became clear that it could be exploited as a commodity by selling services billed based on usage. The platform was officially launched in 2006 and named Amazon Web Services (AWS). Today, AWS provides services to well-known web companies such as Foursquare, Airbnb, Netflix, Pinterest, Reddit, and Spotify.

**What Are Web Services?**
The technology selected to make the infrastructure remotely available to customers was web services running over web protocols. Web services are a method of communication between computers using the World Wide Web. They offer functionalities that developers can use in their software applications to invoke and execute remote functions or methods using open and standardized protocols.

AWS offers more than 40 proprietary web services, ranging from email services to sophisticated database services. For example, Amazon SimpleDB provides a highly available and flexible non-relational data store. Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure and durable data archiving and backup. Amazon Simple Email Service is a scalable and cost-effective email-sending service for the cloud, and Amazon Flexible Payments Service facilitates the digital transfer of money.

Hundreds of thousands of companies use AWS to build their businesses. One interesting example is Foursquare.com.

**Foursquare Use Case**
Foursquare.com is a location-based social app used by 40 million people worldwide to check into places (e.g., restaurants and stores), exchange travel tips, and share locations with friends. The platform performs business intelligence and analytics over more than 4.5 billion check-ins each day.

The major asset of Foursquare is the large amount of data generated by check-ins. This data needs to be continuously stored and processed with business intelligence applications to create reports and long-term trend analysis. In the past, the use of proprietary databases to process data came with high annual licensing costs and the need for qualified engineers to administer the platform.

**Figure 2.1: Foursquare Relies on Amazon Web Services for Storage, Processing, and Business Intelligence**

To reduce costs, Foursquare uses Amazon Web Services (Figure 2.1). For analytics, it adopted Amazon Redshift, a simple, fast, and cost-effective petabyte-scale data warehouse service that offers an efficient solution to analyze data. Simple Storage Service (S3) was also used to store images, and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was contracted for fast and scalable processing.

**The Benefits of Using Web Services**
For most adopters, the key benefits of using web services include cost reductions, flexibility, and higher productivity.

- **Costs:** The services provided by AWS can free businesses from high initial capital costs. Samsung has achieved reliability and performance objectives at a lower cost by relying on cloud services instead of using on-premises data centers, which have high hardware and maintenance expenses.
- **Elasticity:** AWS provides elasticity, enabling the increase of computer resources allocated (e.g., the number of CPUs or the storage available). This elasticity has enabled SEGA to reduce costs by more than 50% with new servers when unplanned load spikes occur after the launch of new games.
- **Investments:** Cloud services free organizations from setting up dedicated IT teams and infrastructures. NASA was able to construct a robust, scalable web infrastructure in a few weeks instead of months to support the Mars exploration program (mars.jpl.nasa.gov).

While Amazon AWS is a leading player in the cloud computing arena, it is not the only one. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are also significant players, along with IBM, Oracle, and HP.

#### 2.1 Perspectives on Services
In 1968, Fuchs [1] presented a study indicating that future employment growth would be almost entirely absorbed by service industries. Today, the most developed countries have become service-based economies in terms of the distribution of people employed. While the first services were delivered by humans to humans, advances in computer systems over the past sixty years have allowed computers to deliver services to humans. Information and communication technology (ICT) has significantly contributed to the evolution of services. Over the years, each wave of innovation has created solutions to automatically execute activities that were once done by human beings.

Services and self-services were covered in Chapter 1, shedding light on the difficulties of finding a single definition for the concept of service. One of the causes of these difficulties is related to the fact that the evolution of services can be observed from two distinct perspectives:
- As the automation of economic activities and self-service.
- As the improvement of a programming paradigm.

**Figure 2.2: Two Perspectives on Service Evolution**
- **Evolution of services towards automation:**
  - Advent of the web (1993)
  - ICT-supported services (ATM, online check-in) (1969)
  - Automation and Self-service (vending machine, e-banking) (1920, 1980s)
- **Evolution of services as programming paradigms:**
  - Advent of the web (1993)
  - Subroutines (Assembler, 1960)
  - Web services (SOAP, WSDL, 1998, 2000)
  - Cloud services (Amazon AWS, 2006)
  - Components (Objective-C, 1986)
  - Semantic web services (DAML-S, OWL-S, 2001, 2004)
  - Internet of services (2007)

The first perspective looks into how traditional services, such as banking and trading, have benefited from automation and information technologies over the years to enable new forms of service delivery like e-banking and e-commerce. The second perspective analyzes how the notion of service has emerged in the discipline of computer science, specifically from the fields of software development and distributed systems, to ultimately give rise to software services such as web services.

A third perspective can also be identified as the intersection of the first two perspectives (shown with dotted lines in the figure). Cloud services and the Internet of Services label a set of solutions that have a component of business from the first perspective and a component of technology from the second perspective.

#### 2.2 Services as the Automation of Activities
This section presents the evolution of services over the last 100 years, highlighting milestones such as the advent of automation and self-services in the 1920s, the emergence of ICT-supported services in the 1970s, and the dissemination of the internet starting in the 1990s, which led to a wide proliferation of electronic services.

##### 2.2.1 Towards Automation and Self-service
In the old times, most services were delivered by human resources. As labor costs increased in industrialized countries, companies sought new ways to deliver services with less human involvement. The answer was automation.

**Automation**
The manufacturing industry had already introduced automation in their production processes in the early 20th century. At the same time, the first modern (mechanical) vending machines were introduced for stamps, postcards, tickets, cigarettes, chewing gum, or candy. Vending machines automate the sales process, so no sales personnel are required anymore. In telephony, modern switching systems were invented to allow the caller to directly dial and automatically get routed to the desired telephone number, previously only possible with the assistance of a telephone operator. After automation, hardly any operator assistance was required.

**Self-service**
All these service automation examples have in common that the person delivering the service was replaced by a machine, and the customer took over the role of the traditional service person. This was the beginning of self-service as a direct consequence of service automation. Even if not all customers accepted self-services from the beginning, the advantages of self-services were soon recognized [2]:
- Machines, unlike shops or offices with service personnel, have no opening hours and are typically available 24/7.
- When using self-service, the customer has the service encounter completely under their own control.
- The customer does not feel rushed, influenced, or pressured by a service person.
- The customer can easily change their mind and interrupt the service process without annoying the service provider.

The emergence of electronics in the second half of the 20th century, and subsequently, the increasing use of computers and ICT, accelerated the progress of service automation. Self-service gasoline stations appeared in the 1950s, automatic teller machines (ATMs) in the 1960s, interactive kiosks in the 1970s, and electronic ticket machines (railway, metro, tram) in the 1980s.

**Example:**
In 1969, the first ATM made its public appearance by providing a cash service to customers of Chemical Bank in Rockville Center, New York.

Most service providers offering self-service technology give their customers a choice. Customers can use the self-service or still request a service person. At a bank, the customer can go to the teller or use an ATM. At many gas stations, the customer can pump the gas themselves or ask an attendant to do it. At the railway station, the customer can go to the ticket counter or use a ticket vending machine.

##### 2.2.2 The Role of Technology
Froehle and Roth [3] have identified five different classes that describe the role of technology in the service encounter (Figure 2.3). Each class groups interactions that can be further classified as face-to-face or face-to-screen.

**Figure 2.3: The Role of Technology in Electronic Services (adapted from [3])**

- **Technology-free and -assisted Services:**
  - **Technology-free services** (Figure 2.3.a) are hardly found anymore. Almost every small business, such as a hairdresser, newspaper store, or beauty salon, now has at least an electronic cash register or credit card reader to support their operations.
  - **Technology-assisted services** (Figure 2.3.b) involve the service provider using technology to improve customer service, but the customer does not have access to this technology. Examples include bank tellers, airline representatives, and rental car clerks who have access to the customer’s data on their computer terminals while interacting with the customer at the counter. In a technology-assisted service situation, the provider is still in physical contact with or in proximity to the customer.

- **Technology-facilitated Services:**
  - In a **technology-facilitated service** (Figure 2.3.c), both the service provider and the customer have access to the technology and are still co-located. An example is an architect who develops a house design interactively with the customer at the computer terminal or a consultant who uses a personal computer attached to a projector to give a presentation to clients.

- **Technology-mediated Services:**
  - In a **technology-mediated service** (Figure 2.3.d), the customer and service provider are not in face-to-face contact. The service is still delivered by people, who, due to the wide dissemination of communication technology like the telephone or internet, can work from almost anywhere in the world. Examples include call-center services (communication typically by phone but also email), internet crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, and labor-intensive administrative services (accounting, human resources management) provided to companies typically from low-wage countries over electronic networks (also known as offshoring). Remote maintenance is an example of a technology-mediated service where a person on the provider’s side (technician) directly acts with the belongings of a customer (machines, computers) over a distance.

**Example:**
Amazon Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com) is an online service that enables human intelligence tasks to be completed by anonymous people. This is an example of a technology-mediated service, where service providers and customers, not physically co-located, are brought “together.”

- **Technology-generated Services:**
  - In **technology-generated services** (Figure 2.3.e), the task of a human service provider is completely replaced by technology. The customer uses the service in a self-service mode. Technology can be mechanical (vending machine), a mixture of mechanical and electronic devices (ATM, check-in kiosk), or purely electronic (home banking). In the context of services, the terms “electrical” or “electronic” are less related to transistors, diodes, or integrated circuits—they mainly refer to the use of information and communication technology. If ICT is the major technology in support of services, one could speak of ICT-mediated or ICT-generated services according to Froehle and Roth’s classification.

**Table 2.1: The Costs of Self-services and Assisted Services**

| Technology Type | Cost |
|-----------------|------|
| Web self-service | $0.24 |
| IVR self-service | $0.45 |
| E-mail assisted  | $5.00 |
| Chat assisted    | $7.00 |
| Phone assisted   | $5.50 |

Technology-generated services are gaining wide acceptance among companies and governmental agencies for three main reasons:
1. **Cost Reduction:** Self-services are generally cost-reducers. In many cases, a customer self-service interaction is approximately 1/20th of the cost of a telephone call. A Yankee Group research report indicates that, within self-service channels, web-based self-service costs just $0.24 for an interaction and $0.45 for an interactive voice response (IVR), as opposed to $5.50 for a customer service representative-assisted interaction via the telephone (Table 2.1).
2. **Improved Customer Experience:** Self-service can improve customer experience by providing a broad spectrum of choices. Nowadays, the number of features available to e-banking customers has never been so wide. Customers can trade stocks, download bank statements, and make bill payments. Some features may even only be available using a self-service mode.
3. **Elimination of Inefficient Interactions:** Self-service can provide a solution to eliminate inefficient provider-customer interaction bottlenecks, such as customers having to wait on the telephone for the availability of staff or to wait in line to be served by customer support. Customers often prefer to perform routine tasks over the internet without requiring any interaction with a representative of an enterprise.

##### 2.2.3 Electronic Services
Both technology-mediated and technology-generated services are better known as electronic services or e-services. They are labeled as face-to-screen services. The technology required for electronic services can typically be distinguished into three architectural components:
