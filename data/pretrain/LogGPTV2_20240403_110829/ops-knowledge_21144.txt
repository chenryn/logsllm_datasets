User: I was wondering whether or not it is considered a good style to call bash commands within a Python script using os.system(). I was also wondering whether or not it is safe to do so as well.
I know how to implement some of the functionality I need in Bash and in Python, but it is much simpler and more intuitive to implement it in Bash. However, I feel like it is very hackish to write os.system("bash code").
Specifically, I want to move all files that end with a certain extension to a directory.
In bash: *mv .ext /path/to/destination
In Python (Pseudocode):
 for file in directory:
    if file.endswith("ext"):
        move file to destination
In this case, what should I do?
Assistant: It always better and better style to use Python functions to do this kind of stuff. With Python it's not that hard to write a script in an OS-independent way instead of using bash.
