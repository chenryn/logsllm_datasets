User: Please describe what virtualization technology is, and list several major virtualization technologies.
Assistant: Virtualization technology is a technology that uses software or hardware technology to isolate and divide computer resources (such as processors, memory, storage devices, etc.) into multiple completely isolated virtual environments through abstraction technology. Virtualization enables multiple virtual machines to run on one physical server, each virtual machine has an independent operating system and applications, and runs as if it were running on a physical computer. Virtualization technology can improve resource utilization and flexibility, simplify management, facilitate isolation, and improve security. Common virtualization technologies include: 1. Full virtualization technology: This technology can simulate a complete computer system, including processor, memory, hard disk, etc., and each virtual machine runs a complete operating system and applications. Typical representatives include VMware, VirtualBox, etc. 2. Paravirtualization technology: Compared with full virtualization, virtual machines with paravirtualization technology can share resources on the physical server, including CPU and memory, and communicate through different APIs, which can achieve higher performance and more Less resource overhead. Representatives include Xen and so on. 3. Container virtualization technology: This technology is a lightweight virtualization technology that does not need to simulate hardware, but by sharing the operating system kernel, multiple lightweight virtual environments can share the system kernel and resources. Typical Representatives include Docker and others. 4. Hardware-assisted virtualization technology: By using the virtualization support provided by the CPU or hardware, the hardware environment can be simulated more efficiently. Representatives include Intel's VT-x and AMD's AMD-V.
