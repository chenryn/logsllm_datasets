I've upgraded from Symfony 2.3 to Symfony 2.5 and encountered a problem.
Before I had the following code (entity with:
`Assert\Callback(methods={"isEmailCollectionValid", "isCompanySelected"})`)
        // this worked fine in Symfony 2.3 but stopped working properly in 2.5
        public function isEmailCollectionValid(ExecutionContextInterface $context)
        {
            foreach ($this->getEmails() as $id => $email) {
                $context->validateValue($email->getValue(), array(
                    new Assert\Email(array(
                        'message' => "'{{ value }}' is not a valid email.",
                    ))
                ), 'emails['.$id.'].value');
            }
        }
Now I have the following code:
        // this doesn't work properly (at least as I expect) in 2.5
        public function isEmailCollectionValid(ExecutionContextInterface $context)
        {
            $validator = $context->getValidator();
            $contextValidator = $validator->inContext($context);
            foreach ($this->getEmails() as $id => $email) {
                $contextValidator->atPath('emails['.$id.'].value')->validate($email->getValue(), array(
                    new Assert\Email(array(
                        'message' => "'{{ value }}' is not a valid email.",
                    ))
                ));
            }
        }
I'm unable to add all the violations to the correspondent fields. Instead the
path is being appended (i.e.: `1. "data.emails[0].value", 2.
"data.emails[0].emails[1].value"`, and so on). And it seems (according to the
sources), no way exists to overcome it. Older code works the same as the newer
one in 2.5.
Moreover, if I have more validators in the same entity (in this entity I have
two of them), then the first error path is appended to the second one, which
also produces wrong error path.
Is it a bug or how can I fix it? Thanks.
