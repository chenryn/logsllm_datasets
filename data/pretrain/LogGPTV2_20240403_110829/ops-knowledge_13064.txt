User: How to Find and Kill Zombie Processes on a Linux System?
Assistant: 1. Find zombie processes: Use the command `ps axo stat,ppid,pid,cmd | grep -w Z` to find all zombie processes whose status is "Z". In the command output format, "stat" is the process status, "ppid" is the parent process ID, "pid" is the process ID, and "cmd" is the process name. 2. Kill the zombie process: For the found zombie process, you can use the command `kill -9 PID` to kill the process. where "PID" is the process ID, found using the command "ps". Note: The zombie process cannot actually be killed, because its parent process no longer responds to signals and has become an orphan process. Use "kill -9 PID" to forcibly kill the process, but its process table entry will still exist until the parent process ends. Therefore, the correct way to solve the zombie process problem is to correctly handle the parent-child process relationship when creating a process to avoid orphan processes.
