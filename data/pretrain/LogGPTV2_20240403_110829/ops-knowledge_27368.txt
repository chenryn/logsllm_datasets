Question: "Why is it not recommended to enable Android Verified Boot (AVB) on A/B devices launched before Android 10 that are upgraded to Android 10 with PRODUCT_RETROFIT_DYNAMIC_PARTITIONS set to true?"
 "A": "Because the devices will not support the logical partition structure required for AVB."
 "B": "Because enabling AVB can lead to frequent system crashes due to incompatibility with the older hardware."
 "C": "Because system_other.img is not included in the over-the-air package, which can lead to verification errors after updates."
