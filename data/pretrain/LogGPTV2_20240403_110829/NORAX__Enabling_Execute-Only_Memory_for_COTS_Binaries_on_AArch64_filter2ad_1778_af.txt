### Overheads and Security Impact

#### Size Overhead
In our functionality tests, the sizes of the selected binaries ranged from approximately 14K to 7M, as shown in Table IX. After transformation, the binary sizes increased by an average of 3.91%. Notably, `libm.so` experienced a significantly larger increase in file size compared to other binaries. Upon manual inspection, we found that this math library contains a large number of constant values hardcoded into various mathematical functions, such as `casinh()` and `cacos()`. As an optimization, the compiler embeds this large set of constant data into the code section to fully exploit spatial locality, which results in more metadata being generated by NORAX during the patching stage.

#### Performance Overhead
We used Unixbench [27] to measure the performance of our system. The benchmark consists of two types of testing programs:
- User-level CPU-bound programs.
- System benchmark programs that evaluate I/O, process creation, and system calls, among other things.

We ran the benchmark on both the stock and patched binaries, repeating each test three times. We then derived the average runtime and space overhead, which are presented in Figure 4.

For the runtime overhead, NORAX introduced an average slowdown of 1.18%. The majority of the overhead came from the system benchmark programs, particularly `Execl`, which showed the maximum slowdown. Upon investigating its source code, we found that this benchmark program repeatedly invokes the `exec` system call from the same process, causing NLoader to repeatedly prepare new bookkeeping structures and destroy old ones (as described in ยง III-D). This process leads to multiple locking and unlocking operations, resulting in the higher overhead. Fortunately, this behavior is not common in typical programs. Additionally, some simple optimizations are possible:
- Employing a more fine-grained locking mechanism.
- Reusing bookkeeping structures when `exec` loads the same image.

For space overhead, NORAX, on average, introduced a 1.78% increase in maximum resident memory and a 3.90% increase in file sizes. Table IX shows the file size increase for individual binaries.

### Embedded Data Identification Correctness
Empirical experiments show that our analysis works well in AArch64 COTS ELFs, with a zero false negative rate and a very low false positive rate in terms of finding embedded data. The last column in the table shows the negligible number of leftover gadgets in the duplicated embedded data set.

| Module | Original Size (KB) | Transformed Size (KB) | Increase (%) | False Positives | Leftover Gadgets |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| libm.so | 14K | 14.5K | 3.57% | 0 | 0 |
| libc.so | 7M | 7.2M | 2.86% | 0 | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Additional Notes
- **User-Level CPU-Bound Programs**: These programs primarily test the computational performance of the system.
- **System Benchmark Programs**: These programs evaluate the system's I/O, process creation, and system call performance, providing a comprehensive view of the system's overall efficiency.
