ABSTRACT
Modern communication technologies are steadily advancing the
physical layer (PHY) data rate in wireless LANs, from hundreds
of Mbps in current 802.11n to over Gbps in the near future. As
PHY data rates increase, however, the overhead of media access
control (MAC) progressively degrades data throughput efﬁciency.
This trend reﬂects a fundamental aspect of the current MAC proto-
col, which allocates the channel as a single resource at a time.
This paper argues that, in a high data rate WLAN, the channel
should be divided into separate subchannels whose width is com-
mensurate with PHY data rate and typical frame size. Multiple
stations can then contend for and use subchannels simultaneously
according to their trafﬁc demands, thereby increasing overall efﬁ-
ciency. We introduce FICA, a ﬁne-grained channel access method
that embodies this approach to media access using two novel tech-
niques. First, it proposes a new PHY architecture based on OFDM
that retains orthogonality among subchannels while relying solely
on the coordination mechanisms in existing WLAN, carrier-sensing
and broadcasting. Second, FICA employs a frequency-domain con-
tention method that uses physical layer RTS/CTS signaling and fre-
quency domain backoff to efﬁciently coordinate subchannel access.
We have implemented FICA, both MAC and PHY layers, using a
software radio platform, and our experiments demonstrate the fea-
sibility of the FICA design. Further, our simulation results suggest
FICA can improve the efﬁciency ratio of WLANs by up to 400%
compared to existing 802.11.

INTRODUCTION
Modern communication technologies are steadily advancing the
physical layer (PHY) data rates in wireless local area networks
(WLANs). For example, the latest ratiﬁed 802.11n standard [1] has
boosted data rates to 600Mbps. This capacity growth is achieved
primarily through wider channel bandwidths and advanced PHY
techniques like MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output). Future
standards like IEEE 802.11ac and 802.11ad are already poised to
provide even faster PHY rates (>1Gbps) in the next few years.
However, the data throughput efﬁciency — the ratio between the
network throughput and the PHY data rate — degrades rapidly as
the PHY data rate increases due to the design of the current 802.11
medium access control (MAC) protocol. For example, given that
most IP packets have a maximal transmit unit (MTU) size around
1500 bytes, the efﬁciency ratio in an 802.11n network at 300Mbps
is only 20%. That is, the 300Mbps data rate can sustain an actual
throughput of only 60Mbps [23].
The fundamental reason for this inefﬁciency is that the current
MAC allocates the entire channel to one station as a single resource.
This allocation strategy can become too coarse-grained when the
channel width increases or PHY data rate increases. Even if a
sender has a small amount of data to send, it still needs to contend
for the entire channel. Such contention resolution time is there-
fore an overhead to the channel time used for data. Unfortunately,
this overhead cannot easily be reduced due to constraints of current
electronics and physical laws. As a result, the higher the PHY data
rate, the lower the throughput efﬁciency will become.
One way to improve the MAC efﬁciency is to extend the use-
ful channel time for data transmissions by sending larger frames.
Indeed, IEEE 802.11n allows frame aggregation, i.e., sending mul-
tiple frames together in one contention period. However, when the
PHY data rate increases, the aggregated frame size needs to in-
crease as well: achieving an efﬁciency of 80% in a 300Mbps net-
work would require frames to be as large as 23KB. This larger ag-
gregated frame means longer delays as the sender must wait to col-
lect enough frames before actual transmission, resulting in adverse
effects to TCP, real-time applications like VoIP and video confer-
encing, and even Web browsing that involves chatty protocols or
short-lived sessions.
We argue that a better way to improve WLAN efﬁciency is to ef-
fectively reduce the channel width and create more channels, where
the channel width is commensurate with PHY data rate and typical
frame size. Multiple stations can then contend for and use these
147smaller channels simultaneously according to their trafﬁc demands,
thereby amortizing MAC coordination and increasing overall efﬁ-
ciency. We call this method ﬁne-grained channel access for high
data rate WLANs.
It is, however, non-trivial to divide a wide channel band into mul-
tiple subchannels without losing useful channel bandwidth. One
common practice is to allocate both edges of two adjacent subchan-
nels as a “guard band” so that the useful transmissions are properly
spaced to avoid interfering with each other. These guard bands can
add up to signiﬁcant overhead, though, especially if the number of
subchannels is large. For example, 802.11a uses a 1.875MHz guard
band at both edges of every channel. If a 20MHz channel is divided
into four 5MHz subchannels, the overhead will amount to 75% of
the total bandwidth. Further, the guard band width cannot be easily
reduced due to power mask requirements and the difﬁculty of ﬁlter
designs, independent of the width of a subchannel.
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a well-
understood PHY-layer technology that can eliminate the need to
have guard bands, if the frequency and width of subchannels are
strategically picked and transmission on each subchannel is syn-
chronized in a way to become “orthogonal”, and hence non-interfering,
to one another. Although some cellular networks (e.g., WiMAX [2]
and 3GPP LTE [3]) have proposed using OFDM in channel multi-
access (OFDMA), doing so requires tight synchronization among
user handsets and they cannot support random access. It thus re-
mains a new technical challenge for how to use OFDM-type chan-
nelization for ﬁne-grained channel access among distributed and
asynchronous stations in a random access WLAN, where it is im-
practical and unnecessary to achieve similar tight synchronization.
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of FICA,
a novel cross-layer architecture based on OFDM that enables ﬁne-
grained subchannel random access in a high data rate WLAN. FICA
introduces two key techniques to address the aforementioned chal-
lenges:
(cid:15) FICA proposes a new PHY architecture based on OFDM.
Solely relying on the coordination mechanisms provided by
existing WLANs, carrier-sensing and broadcasting, FICA re-
tains orthogonality among subchannels with low overhead.
(cid:15) FICA employs a novel frequency-domain contention method
that uses physical layer RTS/CTS signaling and frequency-
domain backoff for contending subchannels. We show that
frequency-domain contention is much more efﬁcient than the
conventional time-domain contention mechanism in a ﬁne-
grained channel access environment.
We have implemented a FICA prototype on the Sora software ra-
dio platform [24]. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility
of our key techniques for both PHY and MAC design. We further
use detailed simulation to evaluate FICA in large-scale wireless en-
vironments under different trafﬁc patterns. Our results show that
FICA has up to a 4-fold gain in efﬁciency compared to existing
802.11n with all its optimizations.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions. (1) We
describe and examine the efﬁciency issue of current MAC protocols
in the context of high-speed WLANs, and argue that this issue can
be resolved by ﬁne-grained channel access. (2) We design and im-
plement FICA, a protocol that enables ﬁne-grained subchannel ran-
dom access in WLANs; (3) We demonstrate the feasibility of FICA
with a prototype implementation on a software radio platform, and
evaluate its performance using detailed simulation. To the best of
our knowledge, FICA is the ﬁrst system that enables ﬁne-grained
channel access in WLANs.

The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a
detailed analysis of the source of inefﬁciency in current MAC pro-
tocols. We then describe the design of FICA in Section 3 and eval-
uate its performance using simulation in Section 4. After describ-
ing the implementation of a FICA prototype using a software radio
platform in Section 5, we evaluate its performance in Section 6.
Finally, Section 7 discusses related work and Section 8 concludes.
2. BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES
2.1 Inefﬁciency of Current WLANs
State-of-the-art MAC protocols in wireless LANs manage the
whole channel (e.g., 20/40MHz width) as a single resource. The
MAC protocol arbitrates access among multiple potential senders
and selects one as the winner, which then consumes the whole
channel resource to transmit.
If multiple senders transmit at the
same time, collisions may happen and receivers will likely fail to
decode the transmissions.
Current 802.11 WLANs use carrier sensing multiple access with
collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) for their MAC protocol. When
the channel is busy, all contending nodes wait until the channel be-
comes free. The MAC employs a random backoff scheme to avoid
having multiple nodes transmitting simultaneously. Each node will
randomly choose a number b within a contention window [0; CW ),
and wait for b time slots before it starts transmitting. If a node de-
tects a transmission detected its backoff period, it will freeze the
backoff counter until the channel is free again. If two nodes ran-
domly choose the same backoff time, their transmissions will even-
tually collide. A collision is usually detected by a missing acknowl-
edgement (ACK) from the receiver. When a collision is detected,
a sender will double its contention window CW according to the
binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm to further reduce the
collision probability for the next transmission.
Figure 1 illustrates the channel access timing diagram of the
802.11 MAC. Figure 1(a) is the basic access method, and Fig-
ure 1(b) shows channel access with the optional RTS/CTS hand-
shake to handle hidden terminals. The Short Inter-frame Space
(SIFS) is the shortest time interval required for a receiver to re-
turn a message to a sender. It is determined by Equation 1, where
trf_delay is the delay incurred to transfer digital signals from the RF
antenna to the processing unit, tproc is the time needed for the pro-
cessing unit to operate on the incoming signals, and tTxRx is the time
needed for the RF front-end to switch from receiving mode to trans-
mitting. Normally, SIFS is about 10–16(cid:22)s. The Distributed Inter-
frame Space (DIFS) is determined based on SIFS and the backoff
slot time, as shown in Equation 2. DIFS is deﬁned to support prior-
ities in CSMA/CA and should be larger than SIFS. The backoff slot
time is critical. It is the minimal time needed for a node to sense
the channel condition and acquire the channel. Slot time is deter-
mined by Equation 3, where tcca is the time for a node to measure

Using these values, we can build a simple analytical model to
compute the efﬁciency ratio for CSMA/CA. Since a node chooses
a random number uniformly from the contention window [0; CW ),
the expected number of backoff slots is W = CW
