## ðŸš€ Feature
Add an op that performs 'and' and 'or' on a bitwise level.  
For example:
`a = torch.LongTensor([3]) # b'11'`  
`b = torch.LongTensor([2]) # b'10'`  
`torch.bitwise_and(a,b) # 2 == b'10'`
## Motivation
As of now, logical_and and logical_or always return bool, and if one wishes to
get the bitwise result, there is no solution available.
## Pitch
A recent implementation of bitwise_xor is very similar to what I am
describing:
