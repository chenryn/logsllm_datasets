Question: "In an argument about the severity of placing a user into an incorrect user group, one individual claims that the access-control system should automatically detect and prevent any malicious usage of this incorrect group membership. Why might this not be a valid argument?"
 "A": "Access-control systems rely on predefined rules and may not have the capability to detect the context of group membership."
 "B": "Users placed in incorrect groups usually do not have any malicious intent, which negates the need for detection."
 "C": "All group memberships are reviewed manually by an administrator on a daily basis, rendering automated detection systems unnecessary."
 "D": "Incorrect group memberships are a rare occurrence and hence do not require a sophisticated detection mechanism."
Answer: A
