As can be seen, all five methods utilize basic computer 
equipment  as  the  transmitter.  However,  whereas  a 
display cable or a speaker may not be present on every 
conceivable computer configuration [26], the CPU and 
memory, utilized by GSMem and SAVAT, are always 
present. On the receiver‚Äôs end, a microphone may not 
be  present  on  every  computer,  particularly  within  a 
classified zone [26]. A cellular FM receiver (as used by 
AirHopper) may not be present on every mobile phone, 
while the baseband processor (used by GSMem) is an 
integral part of any mobile phone.  
In  terms  of  bandwidth,  with  the  dedicated  hardware 
receiver  we  achieved  bit  rates  of  100  to  1000  bit/s. 
However, when using a mobile phone as  the receiver, 
the  bit  rate  was  much  slower  (2  bit/s)  ‚Äì  making  this 
equipment suitable for leaking small amount of data. It 
is important to note that our concept was demonstrated 
on  a  nine  year  old  low-end  phone,  the  only  available 
alternative  with  open  source  firmware,  given  the 
protective 
industry.

will  likely  yield  better  results,  and  is  left  as  a  future 
research direction.    
3.  The Adversarial Attack Model 
GSMem,  viewed  as  a  concept,  contributes  to  the 
general  domain  of  covert  channels.  However,  we 
describe a particular attack  model  which might utilize 
this covert channel for the purpose of data exfiltration. 
The  adversarial  attack  model  is  bifurcated  since  it 
requires  both  a  contaminated  computer  to  serve  as  a 
transmitter  and a contaminated mobile phone to serve 
as a receiver. Infecting a computer within an air-gapped 
network can be accomplished, as demonstrated by the 
attacks involving Stuxnet [27] [28], Agent.Btz [2] and 
others  [1]  [29]  [30]  [31].  Compromising  a  mobile 
phone can occur via social engineering, malicious apps, 
USB interface, or physical access [32] [33] [34]. Once a 
compromised  mobile  phone  is  in  the  vicinity  of  an 
infected computer, it can detect, receive and decode any 
transmitted  signals  and  store  the  relevant  acquired 
information.  Later, the  phone  can  transmit the  data  to 
the attacker via mobile-data, SMS, or Wi-Fi (in the case 
of  smartphones).  Although 
is 
somewhat  complicated,  attackers  have  grown  more 
sophisticated,  and  complex  attack  patterns  have 
increasingly  been  proven  feasible  during  the  last  few 
years [35] [36] [37] [38]. 
4.  Technical Background 
The  exfiltration  channel  is  based  on  the  emission  of 
electromagnetic signals, in the frequencies allocated to 
cellular  bands.  These  signals  can  be  picked  up  by  a 
malicious component located at the baseband level of a 
nearby  mobile  phone.  In  this  section,  we  provide  an 
overview  and  some  helpful 
technical  background 
information  about  cellular  networks  and  frequency 
bands, along with the basics of baseband components in 
mobile phones. 
4.1.  Cellular Networks 
2G,  and  the  newer  3G  and  4G  networks  are  three 
‚Äògenerations‚Äô of mobile networks. Each generation has 
its  own  set  of  standards,  network  architecture, 
infrastructure, and protocol. 2G, 3G, and 4G networks 
are  commonly  referred  to  as  GSM,  UMTS,  and  LTE 
respectively, generally reflecting, the implementation of 
these standards. In this paper, we use the terms GSM, 
UMTS, and LTE to denote the three generations. 
4.1.1. 
Wireless communication between mobile-handsets (i.e., 
mobile  phones)  and  the  cellular  network  takes  place 
through a base transceiver station (BTS), which handles

‚Äòfrequency  bands‚Äô  allocated  for  the  cellular  network. 
Various standards define the radio frequencies allocated 
to each band. In  practice, the standard in use depends 
on  the  country,  region,  and  support  of  the  cellular 
provider.  Modern  mobile  phones  support  all  common 
frequency bands for GSM, UMTS, and LTE, although 
some  phones  are  region  specific.  Table  2  shows  the 
main  frequency  bands  supported  by  modern  mobile 
phones.  Each  band  encompasses  frequencies  within  a 
range  surrounding  (above  and  below) 
the  main 
frequency.  For  example,  GSM-850  has  a  frequency 
range  between  824.2MHz  and  894.2MHz.  Lists  of 
bands  and  their allocated  frequencies  are  specified  by 
the standards [39].

between the mobile phone and  the BTS  occurs  over a 
subset of frequencies within the entire frequency band. 
The 
channel  number 
(ARFCN)  specifies  a  pair  of  radio  carriers  used  for 
transmission (uplink) and reception (downlink) in GSM 
networks. For example, the GSM-850 band consists of 
123  ARFCN  codes  (ARFCN  128  to  ARFCN  251),  in 
which  the  ARFCN  128  code  represents  the  uplink 
frequency of 824.2MHz and the downlink frequency of 
869.2MHz.  In  UMTS  and  LTE,  the  ARFCN  are 
replaced  with  UARFCN  and  EARFCN  respectively. 
The  mapping  of  each  ARFCN  on  the  corresponding 
carrier frequency is given in [40]. 
4.2.  Baseband in Mobile Phones 
Modern mobile phones consist of at least two separate 
processors [9] [41]. The application processor runs the 
main  operating  system  (e.g.,  Android  or  iOS)  and  is 
responsible  for  handling  the  graphical  user  interface, 
memory  management  and  process  scheduling.  The 
baseband  processor  runs  a  dedicated  RTOS  which 
manages  the  radio  communication  and  maintains  the 
protocol  stack.  The  application  processor  and  the 
baseband  processor  work  independently  from  one 
another and have separate memory space. However, it 
is  necessary 
two 
processors  on  a  routine  basis,  for  example,  when  the 
dialer application initiates a call (application processor 
to baseband processor) or when an SMS notification is 
to  exchange  data  between

received (baseband processor to application processor). 
Communication  between  the  processors  is  commonly 
handled  through  a  shared-memory  segment  or  a 
dedicated  serial  interface  [9]  [41].  Unlike  modern 
smartphones,  low-end  mobile  phones,  also  referred  to 
as  feature-phones,  employ  a  single  processor  to  man-
age both user-interface and cellular communication. On 
feature-phones, this single processor is also referred to 
as a baseband processor. 
4.2.1. 
The  baseband  processor  is  an  integral  part  of  the 
baseband  chip.  The  chip  consists  of:  (1)  the  RF 
frontend,  (2)  the  analog  baseband,  (3)  the  digital 
baseband, and (4) the baseband processor [6] [41].

The  RF  frontend  handles  received  and  transmitted 
signals on the physical level. This component consists 
of  items  such  as:  an  antenna,  a  low-noise  amplifier 
(LNA),  and  a  mixer.  The  analog  baseband  contains, 
among other components, an analog to digital converter 
(ADC)  and  a  digital  to  analog  converter  (DAC)  to 
mediate  between  the  digital  baseband  and  the  RF 
frontend.  The  digital  baseband  includes  the  digital 
signal  processor  (DSP)  which  is  responsible  for  the 
lowest 
(i.e., 
modulation/demodulation  and  error-correction).  The 
baseband  processor  is  responsible  for  handling  the 
higher and more complex layers of the protocol stack.

5.  The Transmitter 
The physical effect underlying our transmission method 
is  electromagnetic  radiation  (EMR), a  form  of  energy 
emitted  by  certain  electromagnetic  processes.  The 
emitted  waves  propagate  through  space  in  a  radiant 
manner.  Electromagnetic  waves  have  two  defining 
properties: the frequency ùëì measured in Hertz (Hz) and 
the  amplitude  (i.e.,  strength)  measured  in  decibel-
milliwatts  (dBm).  In  many  cases,  electronics  (such  as 
and 
wiring, 
computer  monitors,  video 
communication  cables)  emit  EMR 
the  radio 
frequency  spectrum.  Their  frequencies  and amplitudes 
depend  on  their  internal  currents  and  voltage.  An 
exploitation of intentional and unintentional emissions 
cards, 
in 
from  computer  components  has  been  addressed  in 
previous research [14] [23] [13] [42]. 
We  propose  that  a  computer‚Äôs  memory  bus  can  be 
exploited  to  act  as  an  antenna  capable  of  transmitting 
information wirelessly to a remote location. When data 
is  exchanged  between  the  CPU  and  the  RAM,  radio 
waves are emitted from the bus‚Äôs long parallel circuits. 
The  emission  frequency  is  loosely  wraps  around  the 
frequency of the RAM‚Äôs I/O bus clock with a marginal 
span of +/-200MHz.  The casual use of a computer does 
not generate these radio waves at significant amplitude, 
since  it  requires  a  major  buildup  of  voltage  in  the 
circuitry. Therefore, we have found that by generating a 
continuous  stream  of  data  over  the  multi-channel 
memory  buses, it is possible to raise the amplitude of 
the emitted radio waves. Using this observation, we are 
able  to  modulate  binary  data  over  these  carrier  waves 
by deterministically starting and stopping multi-channel 
transfers using special CPU instructions. 
In the remainder of this section, we describe the design 
and implementation of the transmitter from the bottom 
up.  First,  we  discuss 
the  carrier  wave  (channel 
frequency) of the emitted radio waves. Next, we discuss 
a method for modulating binary data over a bus. Last, 
we  propose  a  simple  bit  framing  protocol  to  help  the 
receiver demodulate the received signal. It is important 
to  note  that  since  the  focus  of  this  paper  is  the 
feasibility  of  the  proposed  covert  channel,  we  do  not 
exhaustively explore all possible signal modulations or 
bit 
the 
communication  protocol  are  a  subject  of  future 
research. 
5.1.  EMR Emissions 
Multi-channel memory architecture is a technology that 
increases  the  data  transfer  rate  between  the  memory 
modules  and 
the  memory  controller  by  adding 
additional buses in between them. The address space in 
multi-channel  memory  is  spread  across  the  physical 
memory  banks,  consequentially  enabling  data  to  be 
simultaneously  transferred  via multiple  (two,  three,  or 
four)  data  buses.  In  this  way,  more  data  can  be 
transferred  in  each read/write  operation.  For  example, 
motherboards with dual-channel support have 2x64 bit 
data  channels.  Some  computers  support  triple-channel
