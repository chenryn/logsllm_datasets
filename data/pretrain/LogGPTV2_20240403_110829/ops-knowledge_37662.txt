Question: You are tasked with implementing RSA encryption in an Android application. A requirement states that the message to be encrypted does not require a digest, and the RSA key size is 512 bytes. Which `PaddingMode` would you choose for this operation, and what is the minimum size the message can be?
"A": "`PaddingMode::RSA_PKCS1_1_1_5_ENCRYPT` with a minimum message size of 501 bytes.",
"B": "`PaddingMode::RSA_PSS` with a minimum message size of 510 bytes.",
"C": "`PaddingMode::RSA_OAEP` with no minimum message size requirement.",
"D": "`PaddingMode::RSA_OAEP` with a minimum message size of 501 bytes."
Answer: A
