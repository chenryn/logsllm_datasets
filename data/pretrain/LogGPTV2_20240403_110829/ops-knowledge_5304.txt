User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题"sudo service nginx start" fails but "sudo nginx" works - can't figure out why I have a server that is close to new and having a problem with getting nginx to start as expected. I have configured another server basically the same way and it works there. I figure there must be some environmental difference between the two, but I haven't been able to find it.

The short version:

Starts - sudo nginx
Fails - sudo service nginx start
Fails - sudo service nginx restart
works - sudo service nginx stop


When the commands fail they don't really say anything beyond:

 * Restarting nginx nginx                                                [fail]


Nothing else in the log files(nginx[access or error], syslog) or written to screen

More details:

Both say the config file is OK

sudo service nginx configtest
sudo nginx -t



I checked the permissions for nginx.conf and they are OK (same as working server) Double checked that www-data had access to the log files and such and it does
The /etc/init.d/nginx file is the same on both servers and so is the command used (see above)
The log files do exist
user/group www-data does exist
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
nginx 1.6
Ran the requested - sudo strace service nginx start  on each erver
Other than the first piece below, the only other differences I saw between running on the two different servers were things like pointers and the PID. I prefixed the two lines per set that are different with ***


==== The one that works

clone(child_stack=0, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0x7fd6076a09d0) = 24394
close(4)                                = 0
*** read(3, "/run/nginx.pid\n", 128)        = 15

(… snip till the bottom…)

*** rt_sigreturn(0x11)                      = 24396
dup2(11, 2)                             = 2
close(11)                               = 0
read(10, "", 8192)                      = 0
exit_group(0)                           = ?


=============== The one that fails

clone(child_stack=0, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0x7f067e79d9d0) = 21761
close(4)                                = 0
*** read(3, "/run/nginx.pid\nserver_name\n", 128) = 27

(… snip till the bottom…)

*** rt_sigreturn(0x11)                      = 21763
dup2(11, 2)                             = 2
close(11)                               = 0
read(10, "", 8192)                      = 0
exit_group(0)                           = ?

Assistant: I came across this similar situation and it was because the port was already used by another service.

How I found it out ? 

Try running

sudo nginx


rather than starting it as a service and it should display the error message.
