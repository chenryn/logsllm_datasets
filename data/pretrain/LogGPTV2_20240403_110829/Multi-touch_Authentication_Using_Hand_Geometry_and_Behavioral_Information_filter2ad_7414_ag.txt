extracted 20-dimensional features from the multi-touch traces. 
They used DTW to calculate the dissimilarity scores for the 
features. Their method achieved an EER of 7.88% on average 
and 2.98% for the best case “user-defined” gestures. Since no 
restrictions are posed on user’s gestures, the proposed features 
are subject to behavioral variability introduced by variations 
in  separation  and  bending  of  fingers  during  multi-touch 
operations. This led to performance deterioration with time as 
they  reported  EERs  close

to the majority of smartphones with medium or small sized 
screens.  
to  20%  for 
For all investigated behavioral biometrics on smartphone 
platforms,  variations  in  behaviors  or  behavioral  variability 
constitute a serious challenge to undermine the accuracy and 
user  experience  in  real  applications.  To  deal  with  this 
problem,  we  developed  a  new  approach  to  multi-touch 
authentication  by  using  physiological  information  of  hand 
geometry  and  behavioral  characteristics  simultaneously,  so 
that behavioral variability can be largely reduced. 
XI.  DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
A.  Authentication Time 
Authentication time is an important aspect in the usability 
of  an  authentication  system  on  smart  devices  such  as  a 
smartphone. This time is related to action time, verification 
time  and  enrollment  time  for  our  TFST  gesture  based 
authentication.  
Action time is the time required for a user to perform a 
TFST gesture on the touch screen. For the most complex 4-
finger TFST L swipe gesture, it takes 0.75 second in average 
for  a  subject  to  complete.  Verification  time  is  the  time

required for the smart device to verify the legitimacy of a user 
using the multi-touch trace of his TFST gesture performed. A 
prototype  system  we  developed  on  Samsung  Note  1  takes 
about  0.2  second  to  perform  the  verification  with  a  system 
overhead of 20M memory and 1% CPU.  
Enrollment time consists of time to provide the training 
samples and time of model training. As shown in Figure 7, for 
an EER of 3%, a user should provide 20 training samples of 
4-finger  TFST  L  swipe.  It  takes  about  1  minute  for  an 
inexperienced user to complete. The model training with KNN 
on Note 1 takes about 2-3 seconds. To save enrollment time, 
we may allow new users to provide 5 training samples with an 
enrollment  EER  of  5.84%  (Figure  7),  and  update  the 
authentication model in the subsequent authentication stage. 
B.  Advanced Attacks 
In Section VIII, we have shown our method is resilient to 
the  four  common  types  of  attacks  described  in  our  threat 
model. For biometric authentication, replay attack is another 
relevant attack which is effective against fingerprint and face 
recognition [37]. In replay attack [38], an attacker replays a 
legitimate user’s previously recorded authentication action to 
the authentication system.  
For  our  method,  replay  attack  can  be  done  at  the 
touchscreen  interface  outside  a  smart  device,  or  inside  the 
device  by  injecting  recorded  samples  directly  into  the 
dataflow  of  the  authentication  system.  The  latter  approach 
requires access to the inner operation system,  which means 
local protection should be breached at first. This is out of the 
scope of our method as a local protection mechanism. For the 
former approach, its success relies on the replication of both 
the  hand  geometry  and  multi-touch  behavior.  If  not 
impossible, it will be very difficult to be accomplished by the 
type of adversaries we assume to defend against in Section II. 
C.  Future Work 
In this paper, we only analyze simple TFST gestures such 
as vertical, horizontal and L swipes, and investigate their basic 
capabilities  for  user  authentication.  In  fact,  there  are  more 
types of complex TFST gestures worthy of exploration, such 
as  Z  swipe  and  multi-touch  signatures.  The  stability  and 
discernibility  of  these  gestures  are  good  topics  for  future 
research.  
Another important work to pursue in future is to expand 
the dataset. Currently, we have established a reasonably large 
dataset consisting of more than two months of data from 161 
subjects. But all subjects are from within campus, it will be 
helpful to collect data from other population categories such 
as  workers  and  children,  and  from  different  ethnic  groups. 
These  data  can  be  used  to  evaluate  whether  the  results 
achieved  in  this  paper  are  generalizable  to  a  more  diverse 
population and provide a more comprehensive basis to show 
the effectiveness of our approach. 
XII. CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  simple,  fast,  reliable  and 
(sufficiently)  secure  approach  to  multi-touch  authentication 
using information from both hand geometry and behavioral 
characteristics. Users are authenticated by performing simple 
TFST gestures with one swipe on the touchscreen.  
TFST gestures require users to stretch their fingers and put 
them together. This makes the hand posture conform to a fixed 
hand geometry and leads to a more stable behavioral pattern. 
Moreover, TFST gestures require much less touch area than 
traditional  multi-touch 
So  multi-touch 
authentication using TFST gestures can be deployed on a wide 
range  of  multi-touch  enabled  devices  from  small  screen 
smartphones to large screen tablets or laptops. 
operations. 
To evaluate the reliability of our method, we established a 
large-scale  multi-touch  dataset  from  161  subjects.  Data 
collection  process  was  elaborately  designed  to  guarantee 
behavior  variability  with  respect  to  time  was  captured.  We 
performed  a  comprehensive  experimental  analysis  with 
respect to different TFST gestures, feature sets, classifiers and 
sizes of training sets. Our approach achieves an EER of 5.84% 
in  verifying  the  legitimacy  of  a  user  with  only  5  training 
samples and the accuracy is further improved to an EER of 
1.88% with enough training. Moreover, it is demonstrated that 
the  fusion  of  behavioral  information  with  hand  geometry 
features leads to effective resistance to behavioral variability 
over time and our identity model exhibits good applicability 
to future behavioral data.  
Security analyses are also conducted to demonstrate that 
the proposed method is resilient against common smartphone 
authentication threats such as smudge attack, shoulder surfing 
attack and statistical attack. Finally, a usability study shows 
user acceptance of our method.
