ABSTRACT
In this paper, we consider the problem of throughput maxi-
mization in an infrastructure based WLAN. We demonstrate
that most of the proposed protocols though perform opti-
mally for connected network (no hidden terminals), their
performance is worse than even that of standard IEEE 802.11
in presence of hidden terminals. Here we present a stochastic
approximation based algorithm that not only provide opti-
mum throughput in a fully connected network but also when
hidden nodes are present.

INTRODUCTION
Infrastructure based IEEE 802.11 has emerged as one of
the most popular access mechanisms for wireless local area
networks (WLANs). Since its inception, signiﬁcant eﬀort
has been made for improving its throughput. Most of the
proposals aimed at maximizing the throughput of IEEE 802.11
DCF, propose algorithms to tune the access probability of
p-persistent CSMA adaptively using parameter estimation.
Through simulations we see that the performance of such al-
gorithms though optimal in a connected network (no hidden
terminals), their throughput is lesser than even that of stan-
dard 802.11 in the presence of hidden terminals Fig. 1(c).
Node i is hidden from node j if i is outside the sensing range
of j, and as a result i can not perform carrier sensing on j’s
transmissions. We note that hidden nodes cannot always be
eliminated without incurring signiﬁcant throughput penalty
on account of RTS/CTS exchange.
The reason behind the failure of the existing algorithms
when hidden terminals exist is due to the fact that the al-
gorithms are designed using the mathematical model pro-
posed in [1]. This model, however, is valid only in a fully

connected network. Quantifying the throughput of Wireless
LANs when hidden terminals exist has been an open prob-
lem for over a decade.
In the absence of a mathematical
model, obtaining provably throughput optimal algorithms
remained illusive.
In this paper we present an algorithm that not only per-
forms optimally in a fully connected network, but also achieve
near optimal throughput when hidden terminals are present.
In our approach, we use stochastic approximation algorithms
to tune the attempt probability based on the estimates of
throughput at the Access Point. The algorithm is designed
to maximize the estimated throughput and hence is not de-
pendent on the mathematical model that deﬁnes the through-
put equation. Our key contributions are as follows:
• We propose the Weighted Fair Throughput optimal p-
Persistent CSMA (wTOP-CSMA) that is an on-line mecha-
nism for tuning access probability of p-persistent CSMA to
achieve a weighted fair throughput allocation while maxi-
mizing the system throughput in a fully connected network.
• We also show that if the throughput is a quasi-concave
function of the access probability in network with hidden
nodes, then wTOP-CSMA maximizes the system through-
put among all p-persistent CSMA schemes even when hid-
den nodes are present (assuming that all users have the same
weight).
2. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a system with N nodes. We consider the
saturated case, i.e., all nodes always have a packet for trans-
mission to a central Access Point (AP). We assume that
transmissions by AP can be received by all nodes. A node
cannot receive and transmit simultaneously. Every node t is
associated with a weight wt. For the channel access mecha-
nism, we assume the following. A node t transmits a packet
in a slot with probability pt. A slot can be either an idle slot
of a pre-determined duration or a busy slot with some node
transmitting. An idle slot for transmitter t is a slot in which
no transmission is sensed by t. A busy slot for t is the dura-
tion for which it senses the channel to be busy followed by
an idle duration of DIFS (Distributed Inter-Frame Space).
It is assumed that all users transmits the packet using the
same ﬁxed rate R. A transmission by t to AP is successful
if for the entire duration of transmission there is no other
transmission.
We consider a channel access scheme to be weighted fair
throughput optimal if it maximizes the system throughput
while ensuring that the throughput obtained by each node is
proportional to its weight.

3. OUR APPROACH
The wTOP-CSMA algorithm is give in Algorithm 1.The
algorithm was also implemented in ns-3 and the results for
equal weights for all users are presented in Fig. 1. In the al-
gorithm the weighted fair throughput allocation is obtained
using the following theorem.
Theorem 1. In a fully connected network, if the attempt
probability (pt) of every node t in the network is given by
1+(wt−1)p for some ﬁxed p then the throughput of node
pt =
t is wtP
t wt times the system throughput and hence this scheme
is weighted fair.
wtp
System throughput maximization is achieved using the
Kiefer Wolfowitz algorithm [2] which uses stochastic approx-
imation to ﬁnd the maximum of an objective function. The
algorithm only requires that the objective function must be
a quasi-concave function of the variable. Quasi-concavity
of throughput can be seen as follows. For either ”small” or
”large” attempt probabilities the throughput is low due to ei-
ther under-utilization or excessive collisions. This intuitively
implies that the throughput is a quasi-concave function of
the attempt probability even in general networks. We for-
mally state this for a fully connected network.
Theorem 2. In a fully connected network, the throughput
function of the Weighted Fair p-persistent CSMA is a quasi-
concave function of p and hence the wTOP-CSMA algorithm
is weighted fair throughput optimal.
Unfortunately, in the absence of a mathematical model
for networks with hidden terminals quasi-concavity cannot
be proven. Nonetheless we verify the quasi-concavity us-
ing extensive simulations in ns-3 as shown in Fig. 1(a). Of
course, validation through simulations does not prove that
our proposed scheme is optimal when hidden terminals are
present, but it at least states that in the numerous random
topologies that we investigated, our scheme is throughput
optimal as stated here.
Theorem 3. If the throughput function of a p-persistent
CSMA channel access scheme is a quasi-concave function
of the attempt probability then the wTOP-CSMA algorithm
maximizes system throughput.
The proof of the above theorems are presented in the tech-
nical report. The simulations results from ns-3 are shown
in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c). The wTOP-CSMA algorithm
has been compared with the IdleSense algorithm given in [3]
which is an optimal algorithm in a fully connected network.
It can be seen that while both the algorithms perform op-
timally in a fully connected network, IdleSense algorithm
performs worse than even Standard 802.11 when hidden ter-
minals exists (for N < 30). The wTOP-CSMA algorithm
outperforms both the IdleSense and the Standard 802.11 al-
gorithms even when hidden terminals exists. The detailed
proofs and simulations results for weighted fairness are in-
cluded in the technical report [4].
