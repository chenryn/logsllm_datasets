### Chapter 1: Mail Service Setup

#### Limiting Junk Mail
You can configure your mail service to reduce the volume of unsolicited commercial mail, commonly known as junk mail or spam. By implementing certain measures, you can block spam sent to your mail users and prevent spammers from using your server as a relay point.

**What is an Open Relay?**
An open relay is a server that indiscriminately receives and forwards all mail addressed to other servers. Spammers often exploit open relays to avoid having their own SMTP servers blacklisted. If your server is used as an open relay, it may be blacklisted, causing other servers to reject mail from your users.

**Methods to Reduce Spam:**
- **Require SMTP Authentication:** This ensures that only authenticated users can send mail through your server.
- **Restrict SMTP Relay:** Allow only approved servers to relay mail through your server.
- **Reject Unauthorized Connections:** Block connections from disapproved servers.
- **Reject Mail from Blacklisted Servers:** Use ORBS (Open Relay Blocking Services) to reject mail from known spam sources.
- **Filter SMTP Connections:** Use firewall rules to control access to your SMTP service.

##### Requiring SMTP Authentication
If your mail service requires SMTP authentication, unauthorized users cannot use your server as an open relay. Users must provide a valid username and password before they can send mail. Your local mail users must also authenticate before sending mail, which means they need mail client software that supports SMTP authentication.

**Steps to Require SMTP Authentication:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the Filters tab.
4. Check “Accept SMTP relays only from these.”
5. Edit the list of hosts:
   - Click the Add button to add a host.
   - Click the Remove button to delete a selected host.
   - Click the Edit button to modify a selected host.
   - Enter a single IP address or a network/netmask pattern (e.g., 192.168.40.0/21).

For detailed instructions, see “Enabling Secure SMTP Authentication” on page 22 and “Enabling Less Secure SMTP Authentication” on page 23.

##### Restricting SMTP Relay
Your mail service can restrict SMTP relay by allowing only approved hosts to relay mail. Approved hosts can relay through your mail service without authenticating, while non-approved hosts must authenticate first. All hosts can deliver mail to your local mail users without authentication.

**Steps to Restrict SMTP Relay:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the Filters tab.
4. Check “Accept SMTP relays only from these.”
5. Edit the list of hosts:
   - Click the Add button to add a host.
   - Click the Remove button to delete a selected host.
   - Click the Edit button to modify a selected host.
   - Enter a single IP address or a network/netmask pattern (e.g., 192.168.40.0/21).

##### Combinations of SMTP Authentication and Restricted SMTP Relay
| SMTP Requires Authentication | Restricted SMTP Relay | Result |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| On                            | Off                   | All mail servers must authenticate before relaying. Local mail users must also authenticate to send mail. |
| On                            | On                    | Approved mail servers can relay without authentication. Non-approved servers must authenticate to relay. |
| Off                           | On                    | Approved mail servers can relay without authentication. Non-approved servers cannot relay unless they authenticate, but they can deliver to local mail users. Local mail users do not need to authenticate to send mail. This is the most common configuration. |

##### Rejecting SMTP Connections from Specific Servers
You can create a disapproved-hosts list to reject unauthorized SMTP connections. All mail traffic from these servers will be denied, and the SMTP connection will be closed with a 554 error.

**Steps to Reject Unauthorized SMTP Connections:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2 | Click Settings.
3. Select the Filters tab.
4. Check “Refuse all messages from these.”
5. Edit the list of servers:
   - Click the Add button to add a host.
   - Click the Remove button to delete a selected host.
   - Click the Edit button to modify a selected host.
   - Enter a single IP address or a network/netmask pattern.

##### Rejecting Mail from Blacklisted Senders
You can use an ORBS (Open Relay Blocking Service) to reject mail from blacklisted senders. Note that this method may sometimes block valid mail.

**Steps to Reject Mail from Blacklisted Senders:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the Filters tab.
4. Check “Use these junk mail rejection servers.”
5. Edit the list of servers:
   - Click the Add button to add a server.
   - Click the Remove button to delete a selected server.
   - Click the Edit button to modify a selected server.
   - Enter the domain name of the desired RBL server (e.g., rbl.example.com).

##### Filtering SMTP Connections
You can use the firewall service of Mac OS X Server to allow or deny access to your SMTP mail service from specific IP addresses. This prevents communication between the originating host and your mail server, and no SMTP error will be generated.

**Steps to Filter SMTP Connections:**
1. In Server Admin, select Firewall in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Create a firewall IP filter with the following settings:
   - Access: Denied
   - Port number: 25 (or your incoming SMTP port if non-standard)
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Source: The IP address or address range you want to block
   - Destination: Your mail server’s IP address
3. Optionally, log the packets to monitor SMTP abuse.
4. Add more filters for the SMTP port to allow or deny access from other IP addresses or ranges.

For more information on the firewall service, refer to the network services administration guide.

### Chapter 2: Mail Service Maintenance

After setting up your mail service, regular maintenance is essential to keep it running smoothly. The Server Admin application provides features to help with these tasks.

#### Starting and Stopping Mail Service
Mail service usually starts automatically after completing the Server Assistant. You can also start and stop the mail service manually using the Server Admin application.

**Steps to Start or Stop Mail Service:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the General tab.
4. Ensure at least one mail protocol (SMTP, POP, or IMAP) is enabled.
5. Click Start Service or Stop Service in the menubar.

If you plan to turn off the mail service for an extended period, notify your users beforehand.

#### Reloading Mail Service
Reloading the mail service is necessary for changes to take effect, such as after restoring from a backup or altering the alias file. This can be done without interrupting current mail service.

**Steps to Reload Outgoing Mail Service:**
1. Open Terminal.
2. As root, enter the following command:
   ```
   postfix reload
   ```

#### Changing Protocol Settings for Incoming Mail Service
You can change the settings for incoming mail service by enabling or disabling IMAP and POP.

**Steps to Change Protocol Settings:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Click the General tab.
4. Enable or disable the IMAP or POP checkboxes as needed.

#### Improving Performance
Mail service needs to respond quickly when a user wants to read or send a message. To improve performance, consider the following actions:

- **Limit the Number of Mail Connections:** Adjust the load each mail user can put on your server.
- **Move Mail Storage:** Place the mail storage location on its own hard disk or partition.
- **Run Other Services Separately:** Run other services on a different server, especially those that place frequent heavy demands on the server.

#### Working with the Mail Store and Database
The mail database keeps track of messages for all mail service users. You can perform various tasks with the mail database and files, including repairing, converting, specifying storage locations, and backing up and restoring the mail store.

##### Repairing the Mail Store Database
If the mailstore’s database becomes corrupted, you can reconstruct it while the mail server is running.

**Steps to Reconstruct a Corrupted Database:**
1. Open Terminal.app.
2. As root, change to the cyrus user:
   ```
   su cyrus
   ```
3. Enter the following command:
   ```
   /usr/bin/cyrus/bin/reconstruct -r -f /var/spool/imap/[user name]
   ```
For more information, see the `reconstruct` man pages by entering:
```
man reconstruct
```

##### Converting the Mail Store and Database from an Earlier Version
If you have used a previous version of Apple Mail Service, you need to convert your users’ mail messages and mail database to the current format.

**Steps to Convert the Database:**
1. Open Terminal.app.
2. As root, enter the following command:
   ```
   /usr/bin/cyrus/tools/amsmailtool
   ```
The conversion tool displays its status in the terminal as each user and mailbox is migrated. Ensure there is enough available disk space equal to the size of the database file being converted.

##### Specifying the Location for the Mail Database and Mail Store
You can specify where the mail database and message files are stored. By default, the mail database location is `/var/imap/` and the mail store location is `/var/spool/imap/`.

**Steps to Specify the Mail Storage Location:**
1. If mail service is running, stop it. See “Starting and Stopping Mail Service” on page 33 for details.
2. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
3. Click Settings.
4. Click the Advanced tab.
5. Enter the path of the location where you want the mail files to be stored in the “Mail store” field.
6. Restart or reload the mail service.

##### Backing Up and Restoring Mail Messages
You can back up the mail service data by copying the mail service folder. Use the `ditto` command-line tool for backups.

**Important:** Stop the mail service before backing up or restoring the mail service folder to ensure data consistency.

**Steps to Back Up and Restore Mail Messages:**
1. Stop the mail service.
2. Use the `ditto` command to back up the mail service folder.
3. After restoring the mail service folder, notify users that messages have been restored from a backup copy.

If you use the UNIX Sendmail program or another mail transfer agent, also back up the contents of the `/var/mail` folder.

#### Monitoring Mail Messages and Folders
This section describes how to perform common administrative tasks for monitoring mail messages, such as designating an account as a mail administrator and saving mail messages for monitoring and archival purposes.

##### Allowing Administrator Access to the Mail Folders
You can configure IMAP to allow the server administrator to view the mail service hierarchy. Administrators can see user folder locations, create globally shared folders, and set user quotas.

**Steps to Configure Administrator Access:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the General tab and ensure IMAP is enabled.
4. Select an existing user or create a new user using Workgroup Manager to be an IMAP administrator.
5. If you haven’t created a user record for the mail administrator, see the user management guide.
6. Open `/etc/imapd.conf` in a text editor.
7. Find the line that reads “admins:”
8. Add the UID number of the administrator account after the colon.
9. Save your changes.
10. In your email client, create an account that uses IMAP to connect to your mail service using the mail administrator name.

##### Saving Mail Messages for Monitoring and Archival Purposes
You can configure the mail service to send blind carbon copies (Bcc) of each incoming or outgoing message to a specified user or group. This is useful for monitoring or archiving messages.

**Steps to Set Up Bcc for Monitoring:**
1. In Server Admin, select Mail in the Computers & Services pane.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the Filters tab.
4. Check “Send a Bcc to these.”
5. Edit the list of recipients:
   - Click the Add button to add a recipient.
   - Click the Remove button to delete a selected recipient.
   - Click the Edit button to modify a selected recipient.
   - Enter the email address of the recipient.

Set up the specified user or group to receive the Bcc messages using POP, and configure a client email application to periodically clean out the inbox.
