Table 2: Most commonly targeted domains, by count of
unique FQDNs embedding the target domain.
5.1 Who is being targeted?
We begin by investigating which domains are targets for target
embedding. This is important for understanding the motivations
behind and ramifications of embedding targets in domains. We note
that prior approaches have focused on small, hand-picked sets of
potential targets—often on the order of hundreds. Conversely, we
study targeting across the Alexa top-100K most popular websites
(see Section 4).
In total, we observe 256,045 instances of target embedding, com-
ing from 112,262 distinct actual domains and covering 7,581 distinct
target domains from within the Alexa top-100K. Table 2 shows the
most popular target domains, determined by the number of distinct
FQDNs which embed them. We make several key observations:
First, some of the most targeted domains are relatively unpopular.
While attackers have a preference for more popular domains, 5 of
the top 20 most targeted domains have an Alexa ranking over 500.
We are unaware of any prior study of domain impersonations to
include, runescape.com, even though it is the fourth most targeted
domain. These results show the importance of studying targets well
beyond a small, hand-picked set of domains.
Second, many of the most targeted sites exhibit a clear economic
incentive for an attacker. Obtaining login credentials for apple.com,
paypal.com, ebay.com, or the various banking websites (chase.com,
bankofamerica.com, banorte.com) can allow an attacker to make
purchases in the victim’s name (or potentially steal the victim’s
funds directly). Similarly, runescape.com allows for in-game pur-
chases and trade, making its users’ login credentials a valuable asset.
We observe social networking and email services as targets, includ-
ing facebook.com, google.com (e.g., for access to Gmail), mail.ru,
and live.com. Such targets can be valuable pivot points for subse-
quent attacks against a user and the users’ friends and contacts.
We also observe storage services such as icloud.com; these often

Table 3: Top 20 most common actual TLDs used by target em-
bedding domains. “Alexa Rank” ranks the TLD by how many
of the Alexa top-1M websites use that TLD; similarly, “Cen-
sys Rank” ranks by how many unique actual domains from
the entire Censys dataset use that TLD. Our top-20 differs
from APWG’s; theirs includes more country-level TLDs (.uk,
.it, .pl, and .ca), while target-embedding has more TLDs
that can be confused with common English words (.top,
.site, .me, .bid).
sending spam [3]—we believe we are the first to also demonstrate
their use in target embedding campaigns. Economically, the regis-
trars for these TLDs allow anyone to register domains under them
for free. This is naturally appealing to both benevolent users and
attackers (thus the high rankings). Because many of these target
embedding attacks distract users from the real TLD, it does not
matter that the TLDs may be unrecognizable to users.
Second, we observe several TLDs that are frequently used for tar-
get embedding but unpopular in both Alexa and Censys rankings,
such as .online, .cc, .bid, and .pw. We hypothesize that many of these
are useful to attackers because (1) they are unpopular, and thus
users are unlikely to recognize them as TLDs, and (2) they appear to
be relevant with respect to the overall target domain. For example,
appleid.apple.com.page-signin.pw targets apple.com and purports
to be a login page; the .pw TLD bolsters this by appearing to refer
to the user’s password. The three most common targets within a
.pw domain are icloud.com, runescape.com, and apple.com—all of
which benefit from obtaining users’ login credentials. As another ex-
ample, ebay.com-item-iphone-x-256gb-space-gray-unlocked.k7l.bid
targets ebay.com; the .bid TLD bolsters this by appearing to be ask-
ing for the user’s bid. Three of the five most common targets within
a .bid top-level domain are ebay.com, ebay.co.uk, and ebay.de.
Summary These results demonstrate that domains engaged in
target embedding strategically choose their TLD based on economic

times.
contain sensitive data. Finally, we see a large coordinated effort to
target starwars.com (Alexa rank 24,867); as we discuss in Section 6,
we believe this to be a campaign aiming at many targets, but for
unknown reasons starwars.com is the only fully embedded target
domain in this campaign.
Third, we observe a long-tail distribution in the frequency at
which domains are targeted. This is shown in more detail in Fig-
ure 2, which plots the number of unique target embedding domains
as a function of their targets’ Alexa rankings. While the bulk of the
distribution is at the head—the top 100 Alexa domains constitute
51.3% (131,416) of the unique target embedding domains—the tail
extends throughout the entire range of domains we considered.
This still leaves a considerable amount of target embedding from
the long-tail: a nontrivial 14,527 (5.6%) domains targeted a website
with an Alexa ranking over 50,000. 1,760 (23.2%) targets were tar-
geted in only one FQDN, collectively constituting 0.7% of all target
embedding attacks.
Summary Collectively, these results show that attackers are tar-
geting a wide range of websites. Efforts to study domain imper-
sonation must be equally broad; limiting study to, say, financial
institutions or only the most popular sites, would miss a large
fraction of potential attacks.
5.2 Who is doing the targeting?
Here we investigate properties of domains that are targeting others:
how do attackers obtain the actual domains, and how much do they
represent common domain names?
Table 3 shows the most commonly used actual TLDs in observed
target-embedding domains. The table also includes the rank of how
often each TLD appears in the Alexa top-1M, and the rank of how
often each TLD appears in any domain on a certificate from the
Censys dataset. Interestingly, the ranking of the TLDs where target
embedding is observed is much more strongly correlated with the
certificate ranking than with Alexa ranking. We make observations
about two key trends:
First, several highly unpopular TLDs according to Alexa—.ga, .ml,
.cf, .tk, and .gq—are among the most popular for target embedding,
as well as some of the most popular across all certificates. Spamhaus
has identified these as the most abused TLDs for the purposes of

concerns (free TLDs) and keywords relevant to the target (mislead-
ing TLDs like .bid and .pw). They also show that target-embedding
domains exhibit unique characteristics when compared to Alexa-
ranked domains or to all domains from Censys. Finally, these results
show that attackers use a wide range of (real) TLDs. It is therefore
important to use TLD-agnostic datasets, like TLS certificates, when
studying domain impersonation.
5.3 Who is issuing impersonating certificates?
Our results thus far have identified hundreds of thousands of SSL/TLS
certificates that contain target embedding. Next, we investigate
what certificate authorities (CAs) are issuing these certificates, and
how they have changed over time.
Figure 3 shows the number of valid (nonexpired) certificates
issued by each CA over time, for the past four years, that con-
tain at least one target-embedding domain. We make three key
observations:
First, the use of certificates for target embedding is a relatively
recent phenomenon. Prior to 2016, there were very few such certifi-
cates, the most common issuing CA being DigiCert. In 2016, with
the introduction of Let’s Encrypt, the ecosystem began to change
drastically.
Second, over this relatively short period of time, the number
of target embedding certificates has increased exponentially. At
the beginning of 2016, there were only 3,154 target embedding
certificates; by the end of our dataset, there are 124,432, an increase
of 39.45×. This increase comprises three broad epochs: (1) late
2016/early 2017: Let’s Encrypt CA starting issuing many target
embedding certificates, (2) early 2017 to early 2018: COMODO was
increasingly used; interestingly, during this time, the overall number
of target embedding Let’s Encrypt certificates remained relatively
constant, and (3) since early 2018: cPanel became a common issuer
of target embedding certificates, and the overall number of target
embedding certificates has increased drastically across all three of
these CAs.
To control for the overall increase in the number of HTTPS
certificates, Figure 4 shows the fraction of all nonexpired certificates
which included a target embedding domain over the same period of
time as Figure 3. Interestingly, since the launch of Let’s Encrypt, the
fraction of all valid certificates with one or more target embedding
domains has increased, indicating that the results from Figure 3 are
not merely reflective of the increase in the PKI writ large. We do
not yet understand the two spikes after January 2017; they roughly
align with when Let’s Encrypt was launched and when Chrome
began requiring certificates be included in CT logs, but we are
unable to attribute a root cause at this time.
Third, the increase can be largely attributed to CAs who offer free
certificate issuance. Let’s Encrypt [26] is a CA designed to foster
greater adoption of HTTPS by issuing certificates in an automated
fashion, for free. Users who obtained target embedding certificates
quickly made extensive use of this free service; Let’s Encrypt went
from having a zero share of such certificates in early 2016 to issuing
61.76% of valid target embedding certificates at its peak in March
2017. These three CAs now constitute 95.37% of all target embed-
ding certificates. By comparison, these three CAs issued 80.80% of
all of the certificates in our dataset.
Recall that many of the most popular TLDs in target embedding
certificates are those that can be registered for free: .ga, .ml, .cf,
.tk, and .gq. In total, we identify 37,362 target embedding certifi-
cates with these TLDs. For the certificates corresponding to these
five TLDs, we find that 85.91% of them are issued by Let’s Encrypt,
12.13% are issued by cPanel, and only 1.40% are issued by COMODO.
Collectively, 99.42% (37,144) of the domains had both free regis-
tration and free certificate issuance. In other words, there was no
economic barrier of entry to register and secure these domains.
Next, we investigate if there were barriers to hosting them.
Summary These results demonstrate that users who obtain target
embedding certificates appear not to use a wide range of CAs.
Rather, they prefer the small handful of CAs who provide free,
automated certificate issuance. The low economic barrier of entry
to target embedding has resulted in an exponential increase in the
number of such certificates.
5.4 Who is hosting impersonating certificates?
Having investigated how target embedding domains and certificates
are obtained, we turn to how their content is hosted. We used curl
on each valid target embedding domain, and recorded the IP address
of each site that returned a successful HTTP status code. Then, to
