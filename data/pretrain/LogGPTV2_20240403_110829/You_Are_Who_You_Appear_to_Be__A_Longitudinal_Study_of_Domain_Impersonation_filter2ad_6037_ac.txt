### 5.1 Who is Being Targeted?

We begin by examining which domains are being targeted for embedding. This is crucial for understanding the motivations and implications of embedding targets in domains. Previous studies have often focused on small, hand-picked sets of potential targets, typically in the hundreds. In contrast, we analyze targeting across the Alexa top-100K most popular websites (see Section 4).

In total, we observed 256,045 instances of target embedding, originating from 112,262 distinct actual domains and covering 7,581 distinct target domains within the Alexa top-100K. Table 2 lists the most frequently targeted domains, determined by the number of unique FQDNs that embed them. We make several key observations:

1. **Popularity and Targeting**: Some of the most targeted domains are relatively unpopular. While attackers generally prefer more popular domains, 5 of the top 20 most targeted domains have an Alexa ranking over 500. For example, runescape.com, the fourth most targeted domain, has not been included in prior studies of domain impersonations.

2. **Economic Incentives**: Many of the most targeted sites offer clear economic incentives for attackers. Gaining access to login credentials for domains like apple.com, paypal.com, ebay.com, or various banking websites (e.g., chase.com, bankofamerica.com, banorte.com) can enable attackers to make unauthorized purchases or steal funds. Similarly, runescape.com, which allows in-game purchases and trading, makes its users' login credentials a valuable asset.

3. **Social and Email Services**: Social networking and email services such as facebook.com, google.com (for Gmail access), mail.ru, and live.com are also common targets. These can serve as valuable pivot points for subsequent attacks on a user and their contacts.

4. **Storage Services**: Storage services like icloud.com are also targeted, as they often contain sensitive data.

5. **Long-Tail Distribution**: The frequency at which domains are targeted follows a long-tail distribution. As shown in Figure 2, while the top 100 Alexa domains account for 51.3% (131,416) of the unique target embedding domains, a significant number of less popular domains are also targeted. For instance, 14,527 (5.6%) domains targeted a website with an Alexa ranking over 50,000, and 1,760 (23.2%) targets were embedded in only one FQDN, constituting 0.7% of all target embedding attacks.

### Summary
These results highlight that attackers target a wide range of websites. To effectively study domain impersonation, it is essential to consider a broad spectrum of potential targets, including less popular and non-financial sites.

### 5.2 Who is Doing the Targeting?

Next, we investigate the properties of domains that are performing the targeting, focusing on how attackers obtain these domains and their representation among common domain names.

Table 3 shows the most commonly used top-level domains (TLDs) in observed target-embedding domains. The table includes the rank of each TLD in the Alexa top-1M and the Censys dataset. Interestingly, the ranking of TLDs where target embedding is observed correlates more strongly with the Censys ranking than the Alexa ranking. Key observations include:

1. **Unpopular TLDs**: Several TLDs that are highly unpopular according to Alexa (e.g., .ga, .ml, .cf, .tk, .gq) are among the most popular for target embedding. These TLDs are also some of the most abused for spamming, as identified by Spamhaus.

2. **Relevance and Misleading TLDs**: Some TLDs, such as .online, .cc, .bid, and .pw, are frequently used for target embedding but are unpopular in both Alexa and Censys rankings. These TLDs are likely chosen because they are unfamiliar to users and can be misleading. For example, appleid.apple.com.page-signin.pw targets apple.com and appears to be a login page, with .pw suggesting a password-related context.

### Summary
These results demonstrate that attackers strategically choose TLDs based on economic concerns (free TLDs) and keywords relevant to the target (misleading TLDs). They also show that target-embedding domains exhibit unique characteristics compared to Alexa-ranked domains or all domains from Censys. It is important to use TLD-agnostic datasets, such as TLS certificates, when studying domain impersonation.

### 5.3 Who is Issuing Impersonating Certificates?

Our analysis has identified hundreds of thousands of SSL/TLS certificates containing target embedding. We now examine the certificate authorities (CAs) issuing these certificates and how this has changed over time.

Figure 3 shows the number of valid (non-expired) certificates issued by each CA over the past four years, containing at least one target-embedding domain. Key observations include:

1. **Recent Phenomenon**: The use of certificates for target embedding is a relatively recent phenomenon. Prior to 2016, there were very few such certificates, with DigiCert being the most common issuer. The introduction of Let’s Encrypt in 2016 significantly changed the ecosystem.

2. **Exponential Growth**: The number of target-embedding certificates has increased exponentially. From 3,154 in early 2016 to 124,432 at the end of our dataset, this represents a 39.45× increase. This growth can be divided into three periods: (1) late 2016/early 2017: Let’s Encrypt began issuing many target-embedding certificates, (2) early 2017 to early 2018: COMODO was increasingly used, and (3) since early 2018: cPanel became a common issuer, with a drastic increase in the number of target-embedding certificates across all three CAs.

3. **Free Certificate Issuance**: The increase in target-embedding certificates can largely be attributed to CAs offering free certificate issuance. Let’s Encrypt, designed to promote HTTPS adoption, quickly became a popular choice for obtaining target-embedding certificates. By March 2017, Let’s Encrypt issued 61.76% of valid target-embedding certificates. These three CAs (Let’s Encrypt, cPanel, and COMODO) now issue 95.37% of all target-embedding certificates, compared to 80.80% of all certificates in our dataset.

### Summary
These results indicate that users who obtain target-embedding certificates prefer a small number of CAs that provide free, automated certificate issuance. The low economic barrier to entry has led to an exponential increase in the number of such certificates.

### 5.4 Who is Hosting Impersonating Certificates?

Finally, we investigate how the content of target-embedding domains and certificates is hosted. We used `curl` to fetch the IP address of each site that returned a successful HTTP status code. 

### Summary
These results demonstrate that users who obtain target-embedding certificates do not use a wide range of CAs. Instead, they prefer a few CAs that provide free, automated certificate issuance. The low economic barrier to entry has resulted in an exponential increase in the number of such certificates.
