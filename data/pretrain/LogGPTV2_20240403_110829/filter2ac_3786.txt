### Title: Blackhat EU-22: LCDPwn - Exploiting Layer 2 Discovery Protocol Vulnerabilities in Enterprise Devices

When targeting enterprise devices, the attack surface exposed by layer 2 protocols is often overlooked compared to higher-layer protocols. Recent research by Armis Labs, known as CDPwn, highlighted the significant security risks associated with a proprietary layer-2 protocol called CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). This research garnered considerable attention from the security community, but it appears that many enterprise device vendors, including Cisco, have not fully addressed these vulnerabilities. Our work aims to address this gap.

While studying the CDPwn research, several questions arose:
- Were the identified vulnerabilities effectively mitigated?
- Are there any new variants of these vulnerabilities?
- How do other vendors fare in terms of their layer-2 protocol implementations?

To answer these questions, we began by analyzing the vulnerabilities covered in CDPwn and conducting an in-depth code review of the CDP packet parsing mechanisms. Given that CDP is a Cisco-specific protocol, we also examined LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol), a vendor-neutral link-layer protocol used by other manufacturers. Leveraging our findings, we investigated the LLDP packet parsing implementations in devices from various vendors.

Our research uncovered approximately 60 new bugs in CDP/LLDP packet parsers, affecting nearly 70 types of devices from 30 well-known vendors, including Cisco, Ubiquiti, TRENDnet, Zyxel, and NETGEAR.

In this presentation, we will:
1. **Discover New Bugs**: Share our methods for identifying these new vulnerabilities in enterprise devices from leading vendors.
2. **Protocol Format and Differences**: Provide an overview of the CDP and LLDP protocols, highlighting their key differences.
3. **Research Methodology**: Discuss the approach we used to conduct our analysis.
4. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Present a quantitative and qualitative study of CDP/LLDP-related vulnerabilities, including common components found in firmware and the vulnerability patterns within them.
5. **IEEE Standard 802.1AB**: Examine how these vulnerabilities violate the IEEE Standard 802.1AB and provide insights into the implications for network security.

This comprehensive analysis aims to raise awareness and prompt action among enterprise device vendors to address these critical vulnerabilities.
