Hello, I'd like to import some JSX files in my test files. My use case is to
import test helpers from my main codebase. Those include JSX code.
Right now, when I import those files, I get this kind of errors:
    SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
Is there a simple way to add JSX support to `playwright test`?
