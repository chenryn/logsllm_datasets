Hello,

I would like to import some JSX files into my test files. Specifically, I need to import test helpers from my main codebase, which include JSX code. Currently, when I attempt to import these files, I encounter the following error:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

Is there a straightforward way to add JSX support to `Playwright Test`?

Thank you.
