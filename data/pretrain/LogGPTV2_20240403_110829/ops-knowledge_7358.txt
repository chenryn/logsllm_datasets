User: How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?
I'm trying to look for the source of the datetime module in particular, but I'm interested in a more general answer as well.
Assistant: as written above
in python just use     help(module)
ie
import fractions
help(fractions)
if your module, in the example fractions, is installed then it will tell you location and info about it, if its not installed it says module not available
if its not available it doesn't come by default with python in which case you can check where you found it for download info
