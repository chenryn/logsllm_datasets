### Title: Black Hat US 2018: Wrangling with the Ghost: An Inside Story of Mitigating Speculative Execution Side-Channel Vulnerabilities

In 2018, the world was introduced to a new class of hardware vulnerabilities known as Meltdown and Spectre. Such vulnerabilities are exceedingly rare and carry significant implications for the security boundaries that web browsers, operating systems, and cloud providers rely on for data isolation.

To provide context, let's go back to the summer of 2017. The disclosure and subsequent industry response were months in the making. Addressing a new class of vulnerability presents unique challenges, requiring a reevaluation of existing security paradigms.

In this presentation, we will outline Microsoft's approach to researching and mitigating speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities. Our strategy involved assembling experts from across Microsoft, hiring an industry expert to accelerate our understanding of the issues, and fostering unprecedented collaboration within the industry.

This joint presentation by Microsoft and G DATA will offer a firsthand account of the engineering-centric work and collaborative efforts required to address these vulnerabilities. We will introduce the taxonomy and framework we developed, which provided a foundational structure for the industry to reason about this new class of vulnerabilities. Building on initial researcher reports, we expanded our understanding and developed comprehensive mitigations.

We will detail the specific mitigations implemented by Microsoft and discuss their impact on both Spectre and Meltdown. This session aims to provide valuable insights into the technical and collaborative processes that were essential in addressing these critical security threats.
