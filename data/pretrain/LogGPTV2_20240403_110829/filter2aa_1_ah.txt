     Severity of the issue: High
     问题的严重程度：高
    Providing an accurate assessment of severity will make everyone’s lives easier and contribute to a positive relationship between you and the security team.
    提供准确的严重性评估将使每个人的生活更容易，并促进您与安全团队之间的积极关系。
    Step 4: Give Clear Steps to Reproduce
    Next, provide step-by-step instructions for reproducing the vulnerability. Include all relevant setup prerequisites and details you can think of. It’s best to assume the engineer on the other side has no knowledge of the vulnerability and doesn’t know how the application works.
    请提供重现漏洞的逐步说明。包括所有相关的设置前提条件和您可以想到的细节。最好假设另一边的工程师不知道漏洞，也不知道应用程序如何工作。
    For example, a merely okay report might include the following steps to reproduce:
    例如，一个仅仅还可以的报告可能包括以下重现步骤：
     Log in to the site and visit
      https://example.com/change_password
     .
     Click the
      Change Password
     button.
     Intercept the request, and change the
      user_id
     parameter to another user’s ID.
    Notice that these steps aren’t comprehensive or explicit. They don’t specify that you need two test accounts to test for the vulnerability. They also assume that you have enough knowledge about the application and the format of its requests to carry out each step without more instructions.
    请注意，这些步骤不是全面或明确的。它们没有说明你需要两个测试帐户来测试漏洞。它们还假定你已经具有足够的关于应用程序和其请求格式的知识，可以在没有更多指示的情况下执行每个步骤。
    Now, here is an example from a better report:
    现在，这里有一个来自更好的报告的例子：
     Make two accounts on
      example.com
     : account A and account B.
     Log in to
      example.com
     as account A, and visit
      https://example.com/change_password
     .
     Fill in the desired new password in the
      New password
     field, located at the top left of the page.
     Click the
      Change Password
     button located at the top right of the page.
     Intercept the POST request to
      https://example.com/change_password
     and change the
      user_id
     POST parameter to the user ID of account B.
     You can now log in to account B by using the new password you’ve chosen.
    Although the security team will probably still understand the first report, the second report is a lot more specific. By providing many relevant details, you can avoid any misunderstanding and speed up the mitigation process.
    虽然安全团队可能仍然能够理解第一个报告，但第二个报告更加具体。提供许多相关细节，可以避免任何误解并加快缓解过程。
    Step 5: Provide a Proof of Concept
    For simple vulnerabilities, the steps you provide might be all that the security team needs to reproduce the issue. But for more complex vulnerabilities, it’s helpful to include a video, screenshots, or photos documenting your exploit, called a
     proof-of-concept (
     POC
     )
    file.
    对于简单漏洞来说，您提供的步骤可能就足够让安全团队能够再现这个问题了。但对于更复杂的漏洞而言，包含一段视频、屏幕截图或照片来记录你的攻击过程便有助于我们理解，这些被称作概念证明（Proof-of-concept, POC）文件。
    For example, for a CSRF vulnerability, you could include an HTML file with the CSRF payload embedded. This way, all the security team needs to do to reproduce the issue is to open the HTML file in their browser. For an XML external entity attack, include the crafted XML file that you used to execute the attack. And for vulnerabilities that require multiple complicated steps to reproduce, you could film a screen-capture video of you walking through the process.
    例如，针对CSRF漏洞，您可以包含一个带有嵌入的CSRF负载的HTML文件。这样，安全团队只需要在浏览器中打开HTML文件即可复现问题。对于XML外部实体攻击，包含您用于执行攻击的精心制作的XML文件。对于需要多个复杂步骤才能重现的漏洞，您可以拍摄屏幕录像，让观众跟着您的步骤。
    POC files like these save the security team time because they won’t have to prepare the attack payload themselves. You can also include any crafted URLs, scripts, or upload files you used to attack the application.
    这些POC文件将为安全团队节省时间，因为他们无需自己准备攻击载荷。您还可以包括任何定制的URL、脚本或上传文件，用于攻击应用程序。
    Step 6: Describe the Impact and Attack Scenarios
    To help the security team fully understand the potential impact of the vulnerability, you can also illustrate a plausible scenario in which the vulnerability could be exploited. Note that this section is not the same as the severity assessment I mentioned earlier. The severity assessment describes the severity of the consequences of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability, whereas the attack scenario explains what those consequences would actually look like.
    为了帮助安全团队充分了解漏洞可能产生的影响，您还可以举出漏洞可能被利用的合理场景。请注意，这一部分与之前提到的严重性评估不同。严重性评估描述的是攻击者利用漏洞所造成后果的严重程度，而攻击场景则解释了这些后果实际上会是什么样的。
    If hackers exploited this bug, could they take over user accounts? Or could they steal user information and cause large-scale data leaks? Put yourself in a malicious hacker’s shoes and try to escalate the impact of the vulnerability as much as possible. Give the client company a realistic sense of the worst-case scenario. This will help the company prioritize the fix internally and determine if any additional steps or internal investigations are necessary.
    如果黑客利用了这个漏洞，他们能够接管用户帐户吗？或者他们能够窃取用户信息并造成大规模的数据泄露吗？请将自己置身于一个恶意黑客的角度，并尝试最大限度地升级漏洞的影响。给客户公司一个最坏情况的现实感。这将有助于公司确定内部优先修复，并确定是否需要任何额外的步骤或内部调查。
    Here is an example of an impact section:
    以下是一个影响部分的示例：
     Using this vulnerability, all that an attacker needs in order to change a user’s password is their
      user_id
     . Since each user’s public profile page lists the account’s
      user_id
     , anyone can visit any user’s profile, find out their
      user_id
     , and change their password. And because
      user_id
     s are simply sequential numbers, a hacker can even enumerate all the
      user_id
     s and change the passwords of all users! This bug will let attackers take over anyone’s account with minimal effort.
     利用这个漏洞，攻击者只需要知道用户的 user_id 就能够更改他们的密码。由于每个用户的公共个人资料页面都列出了帐户的 user_id，任何人都可以访问任何用户的个人资料页面，找到他们的 user_id 并修改他们的密码。而且，由于 user_id 仅仅是顺序数字，黑客甚至可以枚举所有的 user_id 并更改所有用户的密码！这个漏洞会让攻击者用最小的努力就能接管任何人的帐户。
    A good impact section illustrates how an attacker can realistically exploit a bug. It takes into account any mitigating factors as well as the maximum impact that can be achieved. It should never overstate a bug’s impact or include any hypotheticals.
    一个好的影响部分应该说明攻击者如何现实地利用一个漏洞。它考虑任何缓解因素以及可能达到的最大影响。它不应夸大漏洞的影响力或包含任何假设。
    Step 7: Recommend Possible Mitigations
    You can also recommend possible steps the security team can take to mitigate the vulnerability. This will save the team time when it begins researching mitigations. Often, since you’re the security researcher who discovered the vulnerability, you’ll be familiar with the particular behavior of that application feature, and thus in a good position to come up with a comprehensive fix.
    您也可以向安全团队推荐可能采取的措施来减轻其漏洞。当安全团队开始研究减轻措施时，这将节省时间。通常，作为发现漏洞的安全研究员，您将熟悉该应用程序功能的特定行为，因此处于提出综合解决方案的良好位置。
    However, don’t propose fixes unless you have a good understanding of the root cause of the issue. Internal teams may have much more context and expertise to provide appropriate mitigation strategies applicable to their environment. If you’re not sure what caused the vulnerability or what a possible fix might be, avoid giving any recommendations so you don’t confuse your reader.
    但是，除非你对问题的根本原因有很好的理解，否则不要提出修复建议。内部团队可能拥有更多的背景和专业知识，可以提供适用于他们的环境的适当减轻策略。如果你不确定漏洞的原因或可能的修复方法，最好不要提供任何建议，这样你就不会让你的读者感到困惑。
    Here is a possible mitigation you could propose:
    这里是你可以提出的可能的缓解措施：
     The application should validate the user’s
      user_id
     parameter within the change password request to ensure that the user is authorized to make account modifications. Unauthorized requests should be rejected and logged by the application.
     应用程序应在更改密码请求中验证用户的user_id参数，以确保用户有权进行帐户修改。未经授权的请求应被拒绝并由应用程序记录。
    You don’t have to go into the technical details of the fix, since you don’t have knowledge of the application’s underlying codebase. But as someone who understands the vulnerability class, you can provide a direction for mitigation.
    作为一个理解漏洞类别的人，你无需深入修复的技术细节，因为你并不了解应用程序底层代码。但是，你可以为缓解提供一个方向。
    Step 8: Validate the Report
    Finally, always validate your report. Go through your report one last time to make sure that there are no technical errors, or anything that might prevent the security team from understanding it. Follow your own Steps to Reproduce to ensure that they contain enough details. Examine all of your POC files and code to make sure they work. By validating your reports, you can minimize the possibility of submitting an invalid report.
    最后，一定要验证您的报告。仔细检查一遍您的报告，确保没有技术错误或任何可能阻止安全团队理解的内容。按照您自己的重现步骤确保其包含足够的细节。检查所有的POC文件和代码以确保其可用。通过验证您的报告，您可以最大程度地减少提交无效报告的可能性。
    Additional Tips for Writing Better Reports
    Here are additional tips to help you deliver the best reports possible.
    以下是一些建议，帮助您提供最佳报告。
    Don’t Assume Anything
    First, don’t assume that the security team will be able to understand everything in your report. Remember that you might have been working with this vulnerability for a week, but to the security team receiving the report, it’s all new information. They have a whole host of other responsibilities on their plates and often aren’t as familiar with the feature as you. Additionally, reports are not always assigned to security teams. Newer programs, open source projects, and startups may depend on developers or technical support personnel to handle bug reports instead of having a dedicated security team. Help them understand what you’ve discovered.
    首先，不要假定安全团队能够理解您报告中的所有内容。请记住，您可能已经研究这个漏洞一周了，但对于接收报告的安全团队而言，这都是新信息。他们可能有很多其他的责任，并且通常不像你那么熟悉这个功能。此外，报告并不总是分配给安全团队。新的程序、开源项目和创业公司可能依赖开发人员或技术支持人员来处理漏洞报告，而不是有专门的安全团队。帮助他们理解您发现了什么。
    Be as verbose as possible, and include all the relevant details you can think of. It’s also good to include links to references explaining obscure security knowledge that the security team might not be familiar with. Think about the potential consequences of being verbose versus the consequences of leaving out essential details. The worst thing that can happen if you’re too wordy is that your report will take two extra minutes to read. But if you leave out important details, the remediation of the vulnerability might get delayed, and a malicious hacker might exploit the bug.
    尽可能详细地描述，包括所有相关细节。最好还要提供链接，以便解释安全团队可能不熟悉的晦涩安全知识。请考虑冗长报告的潜在后果和省略关键细节的后果。过分详细的最坏结果就是你的报告需要多花两分钟来阅读。但是如果你遗漏了重要细节，漏洞的修复工作可能会延迟，造成恶意黑客利用漏洞的后果。
    Be Clear and Concise
    On the other hand, don’t include any unnecessary information, such as wordy greetings, jokes, or memes. A security report is a business document, not a letter to your friend. It should be straightforward and to the point. Make your report as short as possible without omitting the key details. You should always be trying to save the security team’s time so they can get to remediating the vulnerability right away.
    另一方面，不要包含任何不必要的信息，比如冗长的问候、笑话或表情包。一份安全报告是一份业务文件，而不是给朋友的信。它应该简单明了，直截了当。在不遗漏关键细节的情况下，尽量让报告尽可能简短。你应该一直在努力节省安全团队的时间，这样他们就可以立即开始修复漏洞。
    Write What You Want to Read
    Always put your reader in mind when writing, and try to build a good reading experience for them. Write in a conversational tone and don’t use leetspeak, slang, or abbreviations. These make the text harder to read and will add to your reader’s annoyance.
    写作时要时刻考虑读者，尝试为他们创造良好的阅读体验。使用谈话式的语气，不要使用网络语言、俚语或缩写。这些会让文章更难读，会让读者更加恼怒。
    Be Professional
    Finally, always communicate with the security team with respect and professionalism. Provide clarifications regarding the report patiently and promptly.
    最后，始终以尊重和专业的态度与安全团队沟通。耐心并及时地提供有关报告的澄清。
    You’ll probably make mistakes when writing reports, and miscommunication will inevitably happen. But remember that as the security researcher, you have the power to minimize that possibility by putting time and care into your writing. By honing your reporting skills in addition to your hacking skills, you can save everyone’s time and maximize your value as a hacker.
    写报告时可能会犯错，不可避免地会有误传情况发生。但要记住，作为安全研究人员，通过投入时间和精力来撰写报告，您有能力最小化这种可能性。通过磨练报告技巧和黑客技能，您可以为大家节省时间，最大化您作为黑客的价值。
    Building a Relationship with the Development Team
    Your job as a hacker doesn’t stop the moment you submit the report. As the person who discovered the vulnerability, you should help the company fix the issue and make sure the vulnerability is fully patched.
    作为一名黑客，你的工作不会在提交报告的那一刻结束。作为发现漏洞的人，你应该帮助公司修复问题，并确保漏洞得到充分修补。
    Let’s talk about how to handle your interactions with the security team after the report submission, and how to build strong relationships with them. Building a strong relationship with the security team will help get your reports resolved more quickly and smoothly. It might even lead to bigger bug bounty payouts if you can consistently contribute to the security of the organization. Some bug bounty hunters have even gotten interviews or job offers from top tech firms because of their bug bounty findings! We’ll go over the different states of your report, what you should do during each stage of the mitigation process, and how to handle conflicts when communicating with the security team.
    让我们谈谈如何处理提交报告后与安全团队的互动，并与他们建立牢固的关系。与安全团队建立良好的关系将有助于更快、更顺利地解决报告问题。如果您可以持续为组织的安全做出贡献，这甚至可能导致更高的漏洞赏金支付。一些漏洞赏金猎人甚至因他们的漏洞发现而得到了顶级科技公司的面试或工作机会！我们将探讨报告的不同状态，在缓解过程的每个阶段中应该做些什么，以及在与安全团队沟通时如何处理冲突。
    Understanding Report States
    Once you’ve submitted your report, the security team will classify it into a
     report state
    , which describes the current status of your report. The report state will change as the process of mitigation moves forward. You can find the report state listed on the bug bounty platform’s interface, or in the messages you receive from security teams.
    一旦您提交了您的报告，安全团队将对其进行分类，以描述您的报告的当前状态。随着减轻过程的推进，报告状态将发生变化。您可以在漏洞赏金平台的界面上找到报告状态，或在您从安全团队收到的消息中找到报告状态。
    Need More Information
    One of the most common report states you’ll see is
     need more information
    . This means the security team didn’t fully understand your report, or couldn’t reproduce the issue by using the information you’ve provided. The security team will usually follow up with questions or requests for additional information about the vulnerability.
    你最常见到的报告之一是需要更多信息。这意味着安全团队没有完全理解你的报告，或者无法通过你提供的信息复现问题。安全团队通常会跟进问题或请求有关漏洞的其他信息。
    In this case, you should revise your report, provide any missing information, and address the security team’s additional concerns.
    在这种情况下，你应该修改你的报告，提供任何缺失的信息，并应对安全团队提出的额外关注。
    Informative
    If the security team marks your report as
     informative
    , they won’t fix the bug. This means they believe the issue you reported is a security concern but not significant enough to warrant a fix. Vulnerabilities that do not impact other users, such as the ability to increase your own scores on an online game, often fall into this category. Another type of bug often marked as informative is a missing security best practice, like allowing users to reuse passwords.
    如果安全团队将您的报告标记为“有用”，则他们不会修复该漏洞。这意味着他们认为您报告的问题是安全问题，但不足以需要解决。不会影响其他用户的漏洞（如在在线游戏中增加自己的分数的能力）通常属于此类别。另一种通常标记为“有用”的错误是缺失的安全最佳实践，例如允许用户重复使用密码。
    In this case, there’s nothing more you can do for the report! The company won’t pay you a bounty, and you don’t have to follow up, unless you believe the security team made a mistake. However, I do recommend that you keep track of informative issues and try to chain them into bigger, more impactful bugs.
    在这种情况下，你对这份报告已经无能为力了！公司不打算支付你赏金，而且你也不需要跟进，除非你认为安全团队犯了错误。不过，我建议你继续追踪信息问题，并尝试将它们链接成更大、更有影响力的漏洞。
    Duplicate
    A
     duplicate
    report status means another hacker has already found the bug, and the company is in the process of remediating the vulnerability.
    重复报告状态意味着另一个黑客已经发现了漏洞，并且公司正在修复这个漏洞的过程中。
    Unfortunately, since companies award bug bounties to only the first hacker who finds the bug, you won’t get paid for duplicates. There’s nothing more to do with the report besides helping the company resolve the issue. You can also try to escalate or chain the bug into a more impactful bug. That way, the security team might see the new report as a separate issue and reward you.
    很遗憾，因为公司只向第一个发现漏洞的黑客授予漏洞赏金，因此重复提交的漏洞是无法获得报酬的。除了帮助公司解决问题外，报告中没有其他事情可做。您还可以尝试将漏洞升级或链接至更具影响力的漏洞。这样，安全团队可能会将新报告视为单独的问题并奖励您。
    N/A
    A
     not applicable (
     N/A
     )
    status means your report doesn’t contain a valid security issue with security implications. This might happen when your report contains technical errors, or if the bug is intentional application behavior.
    "N/A状态意味着您的报告中没有安全问题或安全问题对应的有效信息。这可能是由于您的报告存在技术错误，或者该漏洞是应用程序的意料之中的行为所致。"
    N/A reports don’t pay. There is nothing more for you to do here besides move on and continue hacking!
    N/A报告不会付款。除了继续黑客攻击之外，你在这里没有更多事要做了！
    Triaged
    Security teams
     triage
    a report when they’ve validated the report on their end. This is great news for you, because this usually means the security team is going to fix the bug and reward you with a bounty.
    安全团队在验证报告后进行分类处理。这对你来说是个好消息，因为这通常意味着安全团队将修复漏洞并奖励你赏金。
    Once the report has been triaged, you should help the security team fix the issue. Follow up with their questions promptly, and provide any additional information they ask for.
    一旦报告被分类，您就应该帮助安全团队修复该问题。尽快跟进他们的问题，并提供他们所要求的任何附加信息。
    Resolved
    When your report is marked as
     resolved
    , the reported vulnerability has been fixed. At this point, pat yourself on the back and rejoice in the fact that you’ve made the internet a little safer. If you are participating in a paid bug bounty program, you can also expect to receive your payment at this point!
    当您的报告被标记为已解决时，报告的漏洞已经被修复。此时，请给自己打个“赞”，并欣喜地看到您让互联网更加安全了一点。如果您参加的是有偿漏洞赏金计划，那么此时您也可以期待收到您的报酬！
    There’s nothing more to do with the report besides celebrate and continue hacking.
    除了庆祝并继续攻击之外，报告没有更多的事情要做了。
    Dealing with Conflict
    Not all reports can be resolved quickly and smoothly. Conflicts inevitably happen when the hacker and the security team disagree on the validity of the bug, the severity of the bug, or the appropriate payout amount. Even so, conflicts could ruin your reputation as a hacker, so handling them professionally is key to a successful bug hunting career. Here’s what you should do if you find yourself in conflict with the security team.
    并非所有报告都能迅速和顺利地解决。当黑客和安全团队就漏洞的有效性、严重程度或适当的红利金额存在分歧时，冲突不可避免。即便如此，冲突可能会毁掉你作为黑客的声誉，因此，处理冲突是一个成功的漏洞狩猎生涯的关键。如果您与安全团队发生冲突，以下是您应该做的事情。
    When you disagree with the security team about the validity of the bug, first make sure that all the information in your initial report is correct. Often, security teams mark reports as informative or N/A because of a technical or writing mistake. For example, if you included incorrect URLs in your POC, the security team might not be able to reproduce the issue. If this caused the disagreement, send over a follow-up report with the correct information as soon as possible.
    当您对安全团队关于缺陷的有效性有异议时，请首先确保初始报告中的所有信息都是正确的。通常，由于技术或写作错误，安全团队将报告标记为“信息性”或“N/A”。例如，如果您在POC中包含了错误的URL，则安全团队可能无法重现问题。如果这引起了分歧，请尽快发送带有正确信息的后续报告。
    On the other hand, if you didn’t make a mistake in your report but still believe they’ve labeled the issue incorrectly, send a follow-up explaining why you believe that the bug is a security issue. If that still doesn’t resolve the misunderstanding, you can ask for mediation by the bug bounty platform or other security engineers on the team.
    另一方面，如果您在报告中没有犯错误，但仍然认为他们错误地标记了问题，请发送后续说明为什么您认为该漏洞是安全问题。如果仍然不能解决误解，您可以要求Bug赏金平台或团队中的其他安全工程师进行调解。
    Most of the time, it is difficult for others to see the impact of a vulnerability if it doesn’t belong to a well-known bug class. If the security team dismisses the severity of the reported issue, you should explain some potential attack scenarios to fully illustrate its impact.
    大多数情况下，如果漏洞不属于知名的漏洞类别，其他人很难看到其影响。如果安全团队忽略了所报告问题的严重性，您应该解释一些潜在的攻击情景，以充分说明其影响。
    Finally, if you’re unhappy with the bounty amount, communicate that without resentment. Ask for the organization’s reasoning behind assigning that bounty, and explain why you think you deserve a higher reward. For example, if the person in charge of your report underestimated the severity of the bug, you can elaborate on the impact of the issue when you ask for a higher reward. Whatever you do, always avoid asking for more money without explanation.
    最后，如果你对悬赏金额感到不满意，不要带着怨恨沟通。询问组织分配悬赏的理由，并解释为什么你认为自己应该获得更高的奖励。例如，如果负责你报告的人低估了漏洞的严重程度，当你要求更高的奖励时，你可以详细说明问题的影响。无论你做什么，都要避免没有解释地要求更多的钱。
    Remember, we all make mistakes. If you believe the person handling your report mishandled the issue, ask for reconsideration courteously. Once you’ve made your case, respect the company’s final decision about the fix and bounty amount.
    请记住，我们都会犯错误。如果你认为处理你的报告的人处理了问题，请礼貌地请求重新考虑。一旦你提出了你的要求，尊重公司对修复和赏金数额的最终决定。
    Building a Partnership
    The bug bounty journey doesn’t stop after you’ve resolved a report. You should strive to form long-term partnerships with organizations. This can
    help get your reports resolved more smoothly and might even land you an interview or job offer. You can form good relationships with companies by respecting their time and communicating with professionalism.
    在解决漏洞报告后，漏洞赏金计划之旅并不会停止。您应该努力与组织建立长期合作关系。这可以帮助您更顺利地解决报告，甚至可能获得面试或工作机会。您可以通过尊重他们的时间并以专业的方式沟通，与公司建立良好的关系。
    First, gain respect by always submitting validated reports. Don’t break a company’s trust by spamming, pestering them for money, or verbally abusing the security team. In turn, they’ll respect you and prioritize you as a researcher. Companies often ban hunters who are disrespectful or unreasonable, so avoid falling into those categories at all costs.
    首先，通过始终提交经过验证的报告获得尊重。不要通过垃圾邮件、催要付款或口头虐待安全团队破坏公司的信任。反过来，他们会尊重你并将你视为研究人员的优先考虑对象。公司通常禁止不尊重或不合理的猎人，因此要尽可能避免落入这些类别。
    Also learn the communication style of each organization you work with. How much detail do they expect in their reports? You can learn about a security team’s communication style by reading their publicly disclosed reports, or by incorporating their feedback about your reports into future messages. Do they expect lots of photos and videos to document the bug? Customize your reports to make your reader’s job easier.
    还要学习与每个你合作的组织的沟通风格。他们期望在报告中看到多少细节？通过阅读他们公开披露的报告或将他们对你的报告的反馈纳入未来的消息中，你可以了解一个安全团队的沟通风格。他们期望看到大量的照片和视频来记录漏洞吗？定制你的报告，使你的读者的工作更轻松。
    Finally, make sure you support the security team until they resolve the issue. Many organizations will pay you a bounty upon report triage, but please don’t bail on the security team after you receive the reward! If it’s requested, provide advice to help mitigate the vulnerability, and help security teams confirm that the issue has been fixed. Sometimes organizations will ask you to perform retests for a fee. Always take that opportunity if you can. You’ll not only make money, but also help companies resolve the issue faster.
    最后，确保在安全团队解决问题之前给予他们支持。许多组织会在报告整理后向您支付赏金，但请不要在获得奖励后放弃安全团队！如果需要，提供建议以帮助减轻漏洞，并帮助安全团队确认问题是否已得到解决。有时组织会要求您进行再测试以获取费用。如果可以，一定要抓住这个机会。您不仅可以赚钱，还可以帮助企业更快地解决问题。
    Understanding Why You’re Failing
    You’ve poured hours into looking for vulnerabilities and haven’t found a single one. Or you keep submitting reports that get marked informative, N/A, or duplicate.
    你花费了数小时寻找漏洞，但一个都没有找到。或者你持续提交报告，但它们被标记为信息性、不适用或重复。
    You’ve followed all the rules. You’ve used all the tools. What’s going wrong? What secrets are the leaderboard hackers hiding from you? In this section, I’ll discuss the mistakes that prevent you from succeeding in bug bounties, and how you can improve.
    你已经遵循了所有规则，使用了所有工具。为什么会出错？排行榜黑客隐藏了什么秘密让你无法成功？在本节中，我将讨论阻止您在漏洞赏金任务中取得成功的错误以及您可以如何改进。
