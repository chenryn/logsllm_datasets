### Explanation:
- **Right-to-Left Override (RTLO):** This is a Unicode control character that can be used to change the direction of text, making it appear as if a file name or URL is legitimate when it is actually malicious. By using RTLO, attackers can disguise the true nature of the file, tricking users into opening or executing it.
