I want to run a background service that can read certain events, process and
possibly record the data, and if appropriate create a notification which will
launch the main app if pressed. Some examples of the events would be: new
Bluetooth device in range, incoming data on a socket, incoming data from a USB
device, SMS received, GPS location changed, Bluetooth device connection
attempt, a certain physical button is pressed, accelerometer data exceeds a
specified value, if the main app is terminated, and a lot of other things I'm
not thinking of.
Can someone make a comprehensive plugin (with a free or open source license)
for this that works on iOS and Android? I know that iOS is more restrictive
about background execution, but the plugin could include events associated
with these and their Android equivalents.
**edit: I'm aware of the new background execution feature. The problem is it's
only for plugin developers, and requires a lot of platform specific code. I
think there needs to be a higher level, platform independent plugin that is
accessible to normal developers, not just plugin developers with experience in
Android and iOS programming.
See #3671 (comment) and the responses.**
