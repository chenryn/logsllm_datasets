User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题sudo does not prompt for password and reports 3 incorrect password attempts User smithj is listed in the /etc/sudoers file:

root ALL=(ALL) ALL
smithj ALL=(ALL) ALL


smithj logs into the system via putty. He attempts to sudo but gets this:

sudo adduser jonesjp
Sorry, try again.
Sorry, try again.
Sorry, try again.
sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts


He is never prompted for his password. This is on CentOS 6.

This used to work, but another admin made some unknown changes that resulted in this and he is not available.

Assistant: Some things to check:

Have the user run 'sudo -l'.  This just asks sudo to tell you what permissions you have.  If you can't manage this, there's a fundamental issue authenticating that's probably separate from sudo itself.

Compare /etc/pam.d/sudo with other functional systems (or backups).

Compare /etc/pam.d/system-auth with other functional systems (or backups).  Subtle changes to this system can introduce gnarly troubleshooting problems.

Look at /etc/pam.d/system-auth and see if the pam_access.so module is in use.  If so, you'll want to check whether smithj is allowed in /etc/security/access.conf (unless another file is specified by the pam module).  One potentially tricky problem is if the account is allowed access from a remote IP, but not locally; this ends up allowing a remote log in, but local actions like cron jobs and sudo authentications fail.

Is smithj logging in via password?  Or via keys?  Make sure they can log in with a password to help narrow the problem.  If they can't successfully use their password anywhere, start looking at changes against /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/nsswitch.conf, and any config files associated with the directory you're using (perhaps none, perhaps LDAP, NIS, AD).

If you have a caching daemon running, perhaps nscd or sssd, restart the daemon ('sudo service nscd restart').  These daemons are notorious for having problems.
