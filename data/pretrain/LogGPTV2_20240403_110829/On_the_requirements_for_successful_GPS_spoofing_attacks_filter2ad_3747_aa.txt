ABSTRACT
An increasing number of wireless applications rely on GPS signals
for localization, navigation, and time synchronization. However,
civilian GPS signals are known to be susceptible to spooﬁng at-
tacks which make GPS receivers in range believe that they reside
at locations different than their real physical locations. In this pa-
per, we investigate the requirements for successful GPS spooﬁng
attacks on individuals and groups of victims with civilian or mili-
tary GPS receivers. In particular, we are interested in identifying
from which locations and with which precision the attacker needs
to generate its signals in order to successfully spoof the receivers.
We will show, for example, that any number of receivers can
easily be spoofed to one arbitrary location; however, the attacker is
restricted to only few transmission locations when spooﬁng a group
of receivers while preserving their constellation.
In addition, we investigate the practical aspects of a satellite-
lock takeover, in which a victim receives spoofed signals after ﬁrst
being locked on to legitimate GPS signals. Using a civilian GPS
signal generator, we perform a set of experiments and ﬁnd the min-
imal precision of the attacker’s spooﬁng signals required for covert
satellite-lock takeover.

INTRODUCTION
The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally introduced by
the US military, has become an essential component for numerous
civilian applications. Unlike military GPS signals, civilian GPS
signals are not encrypted or authenticated and were never intended
for safety- and security-critical applications. Nevertheless, GPS-
provided locations are being used in applications such as vehicu-
lar navigation and aviation, asset monitoring (e. g., cargo tracking),

and location-based services (e. g., routing) [23]. The use of the
GPS system also includes time synchronization; examples are time
stamping in security videos and critical time synchronization in ﬁ-
nancial, telecommunications and computer networks. Users highly
rely on the precision and correctness of GPS location and time:
transport companies track trucks, cargoes, and goods under GPS
surveillance, and courts rely on criminals being correctly tracked
by GPS-based ankle monitors.
This heavy reliance on civilian GPS—following the discontinu-
ation of the selective availability feature of GPS in the year 2000—
motivated a number of investigations on the security of GPS. These
investigations found that civilian GPS is susceptible to jamming
and spooﬁng attacks [9, 11, 16, 19]. Successful spooﬁng experi-
ments on standard receivers have been reported [7, 24], showing
that commercial-off-the-shelf receivers do not detect such attacks.
The increased availability of programmable radio platforms such as
USRPs [5] leads to a reduced cost of attacks on GPS. However, the
requirements for GPS spooﬁng were so far not analyzed systemati-
cally and many of the previously proposed countermeasures [8,16]
assume a weak attacker that is, e. g., not able to generate signals
with sufﬁcient precision.
In this work, we investigate spooﬁng attacks on civilian and mil-
itary GPS and analyze the requirements for their success as well as
their limitations in practice. We divide the problem of GPS spoof-
ing into the following two problems: (i) sending the correct spoof-
ing signals such that they reach the receiver with the right timing,
and (ii) getting a victim that is already synchronized to the legiti-
mate GPS service to lock onto the attacker’s spooﬁng signal. Re-
garding the ﬁrst problem, we analyze the effects of GPS spooﬁng
signals on multiple receivers and analyze under which conditions a
group of victims can be spoofed such that, e. g., their mutual dis-
tances are preserved. Our analysis shows that, in order to spoof a
group of victims while preserving the mutual distances, the attacker
can only transmit from a restricted set of locations. To the best of
our knowledge, such an analysis has not been done before. The
second problem of taking over the satellite lock is relevant for per-
forming attacks in real-world situations. In most cases, the victim
will have been receiving legitimate GPS signals when the spooﬁng
attack starts. It is thus important to know the required precision
of the spooﬁng signal such that the victim seamlessly (i. e., with-
out detection) switches lock from the legitimate GPS signal to the
attacker’s spooﬁng signal. We explore the inﬂuence of imperfec-
tions (in different aspects of signal power and timing) in a series of
experiments and discuss the ﬁndings.
The structure of the paper is as follows. We give background
information on GPS positioning and discuss related work on GPS
spooﬁng in Section 2. We introduce the GPS spooﬁng problem
and our system and attacker models in Section 3.
In Section 4,
75we analyze under which conditions GPS spooﬁng attacks are suc-
cessful on single victims and groups of victims. The results of our
experimental evaluation are presented in Section 5. In Section 6,
we introduce a novel countermeasure which is based on multiple
receivers. We conclude the paper in Section 7.
2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce the fundamental concepts of GPS
(based on [11]) which are necessary for this work. We also sum-
marize related work on the security of GPS.
2.1 The Global Positioning System
The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses a number of satel-
i ∈ R3. Each
lite transmitters Si located at known locations LS
transmitter is equipped with a synchronized clock with no clock
offset to the exact system time tS and broadcasts a carefully cho-
sen navigation signal si(t) (low auto-/cross-correlation1, including
timestamps and information on the satellites’ deviation from the
predicted trajectories). The signal propagates with speed c (see
Figure 1).
A receiver V located at the coordinates L ∈ R3 (to be deter-
mined) and using an omnidirectional antenna will receive the com-
bined signal of all satellites in range:
t − |LS
(cid:88)
+ n(L, t)
g(L, t) =
(cid:18)
(cid:19)

i − L|
c
i
where Ai is the attenuation that the signal suffers on its way from
i to L, |LS
i and
LS
L, and n(L, t) is background noise.
i − L| denotes the Euclidean distance between LS
Due to the properties of the signals si(t), the receiver can sepa-
rate the individual terms of this sum and extract the relative spread-
ing code phase, satellite ID, and data content using a replica of the
used spreading code. Given the data and relative phase offsets, the
i − L|/c for each satellite
receiver can identify the time delay |LS
and from that infer the “ranges”
di = |LS
i − L|.

i ,
With three known ranges di to known transmitter positions LS
three equations (2) can be solved unambiguously for L (unless all
three Si are located on a line). Since highly stable clocks (e. g.,
cesium oscillators) are costly and GPS receivers cannot participate
in two-way clock synchronization, in practice, V will have a clock
offset δ to the exact system time: t = tS + δ. With this, Eq. 1 can
be rewritten:
g(L, tS) =
Aisi
+ n(L, tS)

(cid:17)
where the receiver can only infer the “pseudoranges” Ri from the
delays di/c + δ:
Ri = di + c · δ.

The clock offset δ adds a fourth unknown scalar. With pseudo-
range measurements to at least four transmitters Si, the resulting
system of equations (4) can be solved for both L and δ, providing
both the exact position and time, without requiring a precise local

spreading codes. The codes used for military GPS are kept secret;
they serve for signal hiding and authentication.

Figure 1: A GPS receiver V works by observing the signals
from a set of satellites. The relative delays of the signals si(t)
can be used to solve four equations which determine the 3-
dimensional position L and the time offset δ of the receiver V .
Geometrically, given a ∆, each Si’s equation translates into a sphere
with LS
i being the center. The set of equations (5) is overdeter-
mined for more than four satellites and generally does not have a
unique solution for L because of data noise. It can be solved by nu-
merical methods such as a least-mean-square approach or Newton’s
method [1].
2.2 Related Work
In 2001, the Volpe report [8] identiﬁed that (malicious) interfer-
ence with the civilian GPS signal is a serious problem. Starting
with this report, practical spooﬁng attacks were discussed in sev-
eral publications. In [24], the authors use a WelNavigate GS720
satellite simulator mounted in a truck to attack a target receiver in
a second truck. The authors succeeded in taking over the victim’s
satellite lock by manually placing an antenna close to the victim’s
receiver. After the victim was locked onto the attacker’s signal
the spooﬁng signal could be sent from a larger distance. Instead
of using a GPS simulator, the authors of [7] create GPS spooﬁng
signals by decoding legitimate GPS signals and generating time-
shifted copies which are then transmitted with higher energy to
overshadow the original signals; a similar approach is also used
in [14]. This approach requires less expensive equipment but intro-
duces considerable delays between the legitimate and the spoofed
signals. GPS spooﬁng attacks are discussed analytically in [11],
showing that an attacker can manipulate the arrival times of mil-
itary and civilian GPS signals by pulse-delaying or replaying (in-
dividual) navigation signals with a delay. We note that there is no
unique attacker model used for spooﬁng attacks, and thus the as-
sumptions on the attacker’s capabilities vary between these works.
Given the lack of attacker models, the proposed countermeasures
range from simple measures to constant monitoring of the channel.
In [8], consistency checks based on inertial sensors, cryptographic
authentication, and discrimination based on signal strength, time-
of-arrival, polarization, and angle-of-arrival are proposed. The au-
thors of [16, 17, 25] propose countermeasures based on detecting
the side effects of a (not seamless) hostile satellite-lock takeover,
e. g., by monitoring the local clock and Doppler shift of the sig-
nals. Kuhn proposes an asymmetric scheme in [11], based on the
delayed disclosure of the spreading code and timing information.
In general, countermeasures that rely on modiﬁcations of the GPS
satellite signals or the infrastructure (such as [11] and certain pro-
posals in [8]) are unlikely to be implemented in the near future due
to long procurement and deployment cycles. At the same time,
countermeasures based on lock interrupts or signal jumps do not
detect seamless satellite-lock takeovers.
Few publications [3,12–14] present experimental data on the ef-
fects seen by the victim during a spooﬁng attack. The authors
