User: My goal is to know if a file is locked by another process or not, even if I don't have access to that file! 
So to be more clear, let's say I'm opening the file using python's built-in open() with 'wb' switch (for writing). open() will throw IOError with errno 13 (EACCES) if:

the user does not have permission to the file or 
the file is locked by another process

How can I detect case (2) here? 
(My target platform is Windows)
Assistant: You can use os.access for checking your access permission. If access permissions are good, then it has to be the second case.
