### Overview of CSME and TPM2.0 Support
- **CSME Support for TPM2.0**: Since 2015, the Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME) has supported a Trusted Computing Group (TCG) compliant TPM2.0 hardware.
- **Objective**: Our goal is to develop the most capable and feature-rich TPM2.0 on the market.

### Competing with Discrete TPM Devices
- **Physical Attack Mitigations**: To compete with discrete TPM devices, physical attack mitigations, such as the Tunable Replica Circuit (TRC), are essential.

### Fault-Injection Attack Basics
- **Introduction to Fault-Injection Attacks**: Understanding the basics of fault-injection attacks is crucial for developing effective countermeasures.

### Deep Dive into the TRC (Tunable Replica Circuit)
- **What is the TRC?**: The TRC is a critical component designed to detect and mitigate fault-injection attacks.
- **Why and How Intel Integrated the TRC**: This section explains the rationale and implementation details of integrating the TRC into Intel's products.

### TRC Calibration and Validation
- **Calibrating the TRC to Detect an Attack**:
  - **Circuit Failure Points**: Circuits fail at specific points on the Voltage/Frequency curve.
  - **vGlitch Calculation**: At a fixed frequency, the voltage at which circuits fail (vGlitch) is calculated using pre and post-silicon data.
  - **Global vGlitch**: vGlitch is a global parameter for each product.
  - **TRC Calibration Process**:
    - **Conversion to TRC Delay**: TRC calibration involves converting vGlitch to a TRC delay and fusing this configuration into the silicon.
    - **Validation Testing**: A sample of parts from multiple process corners is tested for false-positives and fault-injection. If any part fails, the recipe is modified, and the process is repeated until no failures occur.
  - **TRC Waveforms and Calibration**:
    - **Waveform Diagrams**: Detailed diagrams illustrate the TRC launch and capture flip-flops, and the TRC delay.
    - **Pop-Quiz**: Identify the delay corresponding to vGlitch.
  - **Finding Per-Part vGlitch Delay**:
    - **Initial Silicon Calculation**: Calculate the slope associated with the Voltage/Delay curve.
    - **High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM)**: Each part’s TRC outputs the delay at nominal voltage, and testers calculate the TRC delay at vGlitch using the equation: \( \text{vGlitchDelay} = \text{vNomDelay} - \left( \frac{\text{vGlitch}}{\text{Slope}} \right) \).
    - **Graph Analysis**: Ensure the graph correctly shows the relationship between voltage and delay.

### Fault-Injection Testing
- **Testing Setup**: FI voltages are driven from a generator for varying pulse-widths.
- **Detection Capability**: The red X band highlights the TRC’s detection capability, ensuring it detects voltage glitches before they cause system crashes.
- **Initial Testing Results**: In the first pass, the TRC missed some glitches.
- **TRC Calibration Tuning**:
  - **Initial Test Failures**: The TRC failed initial testing, indicating the calibrated delay code was too low.
  - **Fine-Tuning**: Repeated glitch scans and schmooing the delay codes improved detection.
  - **Optimal Delay Code**: Increasing the delay from 84 to 92 enhanced detection, while 96 provided no additional benefit.

### Testing Results and Productization
- **Second Pass Testing**:
  - **Revised Calibration**: The initial batch of TRCs was recalibrated with a higher vGlitch value.
  - **Final Testing**: The TRC successfully detected attacks at all glitch lengths without false-positives.
  - **Productization**: The new calibration recipe was locked in for 12th Gen Intel® Core™ (ADL) silicon, and high-volume manufacturing began.

### Riscure Engagement
- **Third-Party Evaluation**: Riscure was contracted to evaluate the TRC through clock, voltage, and EMFI testing.
- **Results**: Riscure concluded that all successful glitches were detected by the implemented countermeasures.
