### Apache Airflow version
2.5.0
### What happened
I am trying to set up Airflow Celery to use sentinel. However, we have
multiple sentinel instances up and running. So referring to the examples on
the internet, I tried to pass multiple sentinel URL as below in ENV VAR.
`AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL='sentinel://redis_sentinel1:26379;sentinel://redis_sentinel2:26379'`
(tried with/without quote)
After executing, the worker keeps throwing errors as below:
> Traceback (most recent call last):  
>  File "", line 1, in  
>  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/urllib/parse.py", line 177, in port  
>  raise ValueError(message) from None  
>  **ValueError: Port could not be cast to integer value as
> '26379;sentinel:'**
From the error, it looks like the parser is NOT separating sentinel URLs with
a semicolon separator. Is there any workaround for it?
### What you think should happen instead
Using a semicolon separator, sentinel URLs should be separated, and the Redis
connection pool should make use of all the sentinel URLs.
### How to reproduce
Try to pass multiple sentinel URLs to `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`
environment variables and then try to bring up the airflow workers
