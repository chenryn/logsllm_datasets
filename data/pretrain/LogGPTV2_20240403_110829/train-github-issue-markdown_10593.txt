### Apache Airflow Version
2.5.0

### Issue Description
I am attempting to configure Airflow Celery to use multiple Redis Sentinel instances. Based on examples found online, I tried to pass multiple sentinel URLs in the `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL` environment variable as follows:
```plaintext
AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL='sentinel://redis_sentinel1:26379;sentinel://redis_sentinel2:26379'
```
I also tried this without quotes, but the worker continues to throw the following error:
```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/urllib/parse.py", line 177, in port
    raise ValueError(message) from None
ValueError: Port could not be cast to integer value as '26379;sentinel:'
```
It appears that the parser is not correctly separating the sentinel URLs using the semicolon separator. Is there a workaround for this issue?

### Expected Behavior
The sentinel URLs should be separated by a semicolon, and the Redis connection pool should utilize all provided sentinel URLs.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set the `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL` environment variable with multiple sentinel URLs, e.g.:
   ```plaintext
   AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL='sentinel://redis_sentinel1:26379;sentinel://redis_sentinel2:26379'
   ```
2. Start the Airflow workers.
3. Observe the error in the logs.
