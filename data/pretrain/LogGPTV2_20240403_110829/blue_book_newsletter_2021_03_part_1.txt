# [Introduction](index.md)
* Reorganization: Merge the Meta article into the index.
# [Projects](projects.md)
* Improvement: [Add mkdocs-newsletter as a dormant plant.](projects.md#mkdocs-newsletter)
    MkDocs plugin to show the changes of documentation repositories in
    a user friendly format, at the same time that it's easy for the authors
    to maintain.
    It creates daily, weekly, monthly and yearly newsletter articles with
    the changes of each period. Those pages, stored under the `Newsletters`
    section, are filled with the changes extracted from the commit messages
    of the git history.  The changes are grouped by categories,
    subcategories and then by file using the order of the site's navigation
    structure. RSS feeds are also created for each newsletter type, so it's
    easy for people to keep updated with the evolution of the site.
* Reorganization: Update and reorganize projects.
    Following the [digital garden](digital_garden.md) metaphor
* Reorganization: [Merge the wish_list article into the projects.](projects.md#seeds)
* New: Add seed to follow the updates of software.
* New: Add seed to automatically update the dockers of maintained services.
# DevOps
## Infrastructure as Code
### [Helm Git](helm_git.md)
* Correction: Suggest version 0.8.0 until issue is solved.
    Newer versions have
    a [bug](https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git/issues/131) that makes
    impossible to use helm_git with a repository that contains just one
    chart in the root of the git repository.
## Monitoring
### [Prometheus Install](prometheus_installation.md)
* Correction: Add warning that helm 2 support is dropped.
    If you want to use the helm chart above 11.1.7 you need to use helm 3.
* Improvement: [Add upgrading notes from 10.x -> 11.1.7.](prometheus_installation.md#upgrading-notes)
    !!! warning "Don't upgrade to 12.x if you're still using Helm 2."
## [Scrum](scrum.md)
* New: Introduce the scrum framework.
    [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an
    [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) framework for
    developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial
    emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields such
    as personal task management.  It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members,
    who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed
    iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two
    weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings,
    called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to
    demonstrate the work done, a sprint retrospective to improve continuously, and
    a sprint planning to prepare next sprint's tasks.
    In the article I explain:
    * I use to do [the meetings](scrum.md#the-meetings): [Daily](scrum.md#daily-meetings), [Refinement](scrum.md#refinement-meetings), [Retros](scrum.md#retro-meetings), [Reviews](scrum.md#review-meetings) and [Plannings](scrum.md#planning-meetings).
    * The relevant [roles](scrum.md#the-roles).
    * Some [definitions](scrum.md#definitions), such as definition of done
      and definition of ready.
# Coding
## [Python](python.md)
* New: Add python landing page.
### [Code Styling](python_code_styling.md)
* Improvement: Don't use try-except to initialize dictionaries.
    Instead of:
    ```python
    try:
        dictionary['key']
    except KeyError:
        dictionary['key'] = {}
    ```
    Use:
    ```python
    dictionary.setdefault('key', {})
    ```
### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)
* New: Add date management snippets.
    * [Get the week number of a datetime](python_snippets.md#get-the-week-number-of-a-datetime): `datetime.datetime(2010, 6, 16).isocalendar()[1]`.
    * [Get the Monday of a week number](python_snippets.md#get-the-monday-of-a-week-number):
      ```python
      import datetime
      d = "2013-W26"
      r = datetime.datetime.strptime(d + '-1', "%Y-W%W-%w")
      ```
    * [Get the month name from a number](python_snippets.md#get-the-month-name-from-a-number):
      ```python
      import calendar
      >> calendar.month_name[3]
      'March'
      ```
    * [Get ordinal from number](python_snippets.md#get-ordinal-from-number)
      ```python
      def int_to_ordinal(number: int) -> str:
          '''Convert an integer into its ordinal representation.
          make_ordinal(0)   => '0th'
          make_ordinal(3)   => '3rd'
          make_ordinal(122) => '122nd'
          make_ordinal(213) => '213th'
          Args:
              number: Number to convert
          Returns:
              ordinal representation of the number
          '''
          suffix = ['th', 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th'][min(number % 10, 4)]
          if 11 <= (number % 100) <= 13:
              suffix = 'th'
          return f"{number}{suffix}"
      ```
* New: Add file management snippets.
    * [Remove the extension of a file](python_snippets.md#remove-the-extension-of-a-file)
    * [Iterate over the files of a directory](python_snippets.md#iterate-over-the-files-of-a-directory)
    * [Create directory](python_snippets.md#create-directory)
    * [Touch a file](python_snippets.md#touch-a-file)
* Improvement: [Get the first day of next month.](python_snippets.md#get-the-first-day-of-next-month)
* New: [Explain how to test directories and files.](python_snippets.md#check-directories-and-files)
### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)
* Correction: How to solve the No name 'BaseModel' in module 'pydantic'.
    It's still a patch, so I've also monitored the relevant
    [issues](issues.md#pydantic-errors)
## Javascript
### [MermaidJS](mermaidjs.md)
* New: Introduce the diagram library and how to make flowchart diagrams.
    [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io) is a Javascript library that lets you create diagrams using text and code.
    It can render the [next diagram
    types](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/?id=diagrams-that-mermaid-can-render):
    * Flowchart
    * Sequence.
    * Gantt
    * Class
    * Git graph
    * Entity Relationship
    * User journey
## [Issues](issues.md)
* Improvement: Track python dependency errors.
* Correction: Gitdb has updated smmap.
* New: Jellyfin 10.7.1 broke the login page.
    Don't upgrade till it's solved, as the rollback is not easy.
* Correction: Jellyfin login page problem after upgrade to 10.7.X is solved.
    Surprisingly the instructions in
    [#5489](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/5489) solved it.
    ```bash
    systemctl stop jellyfin.service
    mv /var/lib/jellyfin/data/jellyfin.db{,.bak}
    systemctl start jellyfin.service
    [ Go to JF URL, get asked to log in even though there are no Users in the JF DB now]
    systemctl stop jellyfin.service
    mv /var/lib/jellyfin/data/jellyfin.db{.bak,}
    systemctl start jellyfin.service
    ```
# Software Architecture
## [Architecture Decision Record](adr.md)
* Improvement: Explain how to show relationship between ADRs.
    Suggest a [mermaidjs](mermaidjs.md) diagram to show the state of the
    project ADRs.
# Life Management
## Automation
### [Life Automation](life_management.md)
* New: Suggest organize to act on computer file changes.
    [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks good for
    automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it with
    [inotifywait](https://askubuntu.com/a/819290) instead of with a [cron
    job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).
### [Fitness Tracker](fitness_band.md)
* Improvement: Discovery of wasp-os and Colmi P8.
