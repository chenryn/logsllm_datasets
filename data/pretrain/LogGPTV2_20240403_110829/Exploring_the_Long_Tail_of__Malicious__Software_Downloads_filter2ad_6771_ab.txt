Table 1. Monthly summary of data collected by the anti-malware vendor (AMV)
These results are summarized in Table 1, whereas Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize the distribution of 
malware  families  and  types,  respectively,  for  the  downloaded  files  that  were  labeled  as  malicious.  As 
mentioned in Section 2, we obtained the malware family names in Figure 1 by running AVclass [18] on 
our dataset of known malicious files. The figure only shows the top 25 families by number of samples. 
Overall, our dataset contains malware from 363 different families, according to AVclass. However, for 
58% of the samples, AVclass was unable to derive a family name. We also provide a brief description of 
malware types in our dataset in Table 2. Among all malware types, droppers were the most common type 
in our dataset. Also note the “undefined” type, which refers to those malicious files that were assigned 
generic AV labels (e.g., Artemis by McAfee) or labels for which we did not have any mappings available.

4. Analysis of Software 
Download Events
In this section, we present an in-depth analysis of the trends we observed in our collection of software 
download events. We will focus mainly on which files were downloaded, and from where, leaving a more 
detailed analysis of how files are downloaded (i.e., by what downloading processes and machines) to 
Section 5.
4.1. File Prevalence
Figure 2 reports the prevalence of the downloaded files. We define the prevalence of a downloaded file 
as the total number of distinct machines that downloaded the file. The results show that the prevalence 
distribution for all downloaded files has a very long tail. It should be noted that this is partly due to the fact 
that highly popular (i.e., high-prevalence) software files are not collected by AMV’s software agents, as 
discussed in Section 2.1. The section also explains that file download events are reported only until their 
prevalence exceeds 20 and if they are executed.
Figure 2. Prevalence of the downloaded software files
13 | Exploring the Long Tail of (Malicious) Software Downloads
Nonetheless,  it  is  remarkable  that  only  one  machine  downloaded  and  executed  almost  90%  of  all 
downloaded files. We can notice from Figure 2 that the long-tail of the prevalence distribution is driven by 
unknown files (i.e., files for which no ground truth is available), which have an extremely low prevalence 
compared to benign and known malicious files. We also explored the distribution of different malware 
types and found that they are very similar to each other.
In aggregate, these unknown files have been downloaded and run by 69% of the 1.1 million machines we 
monitored. Clearly, if a large percentage of the unknown files are malicious, it would affect a very large 
fraction of machines. It is therefore important to study this long tail, given the large number of machines 
involved.
4.2. Analysis of Download URLs
Table 3 reports the most contacted effective second-level domains (e2LDs) from which software files were 
downloaded, according to different criteria. Here we define the popularity of a domain by the total number 
of  unique  machines  that  contacted  the  domain  to  download  a  file.  The  “Overall”  column  reports  the 
most popular domains in general, while the “Benign” and “Malicious” columns report the most popular 
domains from which benign and malicious files were downloaded, respectively.

Table 3. Domains with highest download popularity
Table  3  shows  that  many  file  hosting  services,  such  as  softonic.com,  cloudfront.com,  and 
mediafire.com, are used for distributing legitimate software and abused by malware distributors. This 
represents a challenge for malware detection systems that rely on a notion of reputation for the download 
server/URL  (e.g.,  CAMP  [16]  and  Amico  [20]),  because  the  mixed  the  reputation  of  the  domains/IPs 
14 | Exploring the Long Tail of (Malicious) Software Downloads
that serve both benign and malicious downloads could cause a significant number of false positives or 
negatives.
Also, from Table 4, which reports the domains in our dataset that serve the highest number of unique 
downloaded  benign  and  malicious  files,  we  can  see  that  there  is  again  a  notable  overlap  among 
the  domains  listed  under  different  columns.  For  example,  domains  such  as  softonic.com  and  
mediafire.com  host  the  highest  number  of  both  benign  and  malicious  files.  This  suggests  that  files 
downloaded from these software hosting websites are not entirely trustworthy. In fact, the comparison 
of the distribution of the Alexa ranks of domains from which benign and malicious files are downloaded 
(shown  in  Figure  3)  suggests  that  malicious  files  aggressively  use  higher  Alexa  ranked  domains  for 
distribution.

Table 4. Number of files served per domain (top 10 domains)
15 | Exploring the Long Tail of (Malicious) Software Downloads
Figure 3. Distribution of the Alexa ranks of domains hosting benign and malicious files
Table 5 reports a break-down by malicious file type of the number of files served per domain. From Table 
5, we can make some interesting observations. Some malicious file types, such as dropper, rely heavily 
on file hosting services to spread, while other types, such as bot, seem to employ other sources for their 
distribution.  Also,  we  can  see  that  domains  used  to  distribute  fakeavs,  such  as  5k-stopadware2014.
in,  sncpwindefender2014.in,  webantiviruspro-fr.pw,  etc.,  embed  social  engineering  tactics  in  the 
domain name themselves. Another interesting point, which seems to confirm findings reported in [13], 
is that adware usually spreads by utilizing free live streaming services, such as media-watch-app.com, 
trustmediaviewer.com, vidply.net, etc.
