### 4. Analysis of Software Download Events

In this section, we present an in-depth analysis of the trends observed in our collection of software download events. We will focus mainly on which files were downloaded and from where, leaving a more detailed analysis of how files are downloaded (i.e., by what downloading processes and machines) to Section 5.

#### 4.1. File Prevalence

**Figure 2: Prevalence of the Downloaded Software Files**
- The prevalence distribution for all downloaded files has a very long tail, partly due to the fact that highly popular (i.e., high-prevalence) software files are not collected by AMVâ€™s software agents, as discussed in Section 2.1.
- File download events are reported only until their prevalence exceeds 20 and if they are executed.
- Notably, almost 90% of all downloaded files were downloaded and executed by only one machine.
- The long-tail of the prevalence distribution is driven by unknown files (i.e., files for which no ground truth is available), which have an extremely low prevalence compared to benign and known malicious files.
- In aggregate, these unknown files have been downloaded and run by 69% of the 1.1 million machines we monitored. If a large percentage of these unknown files are malicious, it would affect a very large fraction of machines, making it important to study this long tail.

#### 4.2. Analysis of Download URLs

**Table 3: Domains with Highest Download Popularity**

- Many file hosting services, such as softonic.com, cloudfront.net, and mediafire.com, are used for distributing both legitimate and malicious software. This represents a challenge for malware detection systems that rely on reputation-based methods, as the mixed reputation of these domains can cause significant false positives or negatives.

- There is a notable overlap among the domains listed under different columns, suggesting that files downloaded from these software hosting websites are not entirely trustworthy.
- The comparison of the distribution of the Alexa ranks of domains from which benign and malicious files are downloaded (shown in Figure 3) suggests that malicious files aggressively use higher Alexa-ranked domains for distribution.

**Figure 3: Distribution of the Alexa Ranks of Domains Hosting Benign and Malicious Files**

**Table 5: Break-Down by Malicious File Type of the Number of Files Served per Domain**

| Malicious File Type | # of Files (Bot) | # of Files (Dropper) |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| -                    | -                | -                    |

- Some malicious file types, such as droppers, rely heavily on file hosting services to spread, while others, such as bots, seem to employ other sources for their distribution.
- Domains used to distribute fake AVs, such as 5k-stopadware2014.in, sncpwindefender2014.in, and webantiviruspro-fr.pw, embed social engineering tactics in the domain names themselves.
- Adware often spreads by utilizing free live streaming services, such as media-watch-app.com, trustmediaviewer.com, and vidply.net, confirming findings reported in [13].

This structured and detailed presentation should make the information clearer, more coherent, and more professional.
