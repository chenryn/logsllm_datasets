I upgraded my flutter and there are something wrong with my project: the third
libraries can not be found. So I run "flutter packages get", and the result
is:
    Running "flutter packages get" in XXX...
    The current Flutter SDK version is 0.0.0-unknown.
    Because XXX depends on shared_preferences >=0.4.0 which requires Flutter SDK version >=0.1.4 <2.0.0, version solving failed.
    pub get failed (1)
Then I run "flutter doctor -v", and the result is :

Why the flutter version is "v0.0.0-unknown"?
