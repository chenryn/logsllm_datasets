I recently upgraded my Flutter SDK, and I'm now encountering issues with my project. Specifically, the third-party libraries cannot be found. When I run `flutter packages get`, I receive the following error:

```
Running "flutter packages get" in XXX...
The current Flutter SDK version is 0.0.0-unknown.
Because XXX depends on shared_preferences >=0.4.0 which requires Flutter SDK version >=0.1.4 <2.0.0, version solving failed.
pub get failed (1)
```

To further diagnose the issue, I ran `flutter doctor -v` and received the following output:

```

I noticed that the Flutter version is listed as `v0.0.0-unknown`. Can you help me understand why this is happening and how to resolve it?
