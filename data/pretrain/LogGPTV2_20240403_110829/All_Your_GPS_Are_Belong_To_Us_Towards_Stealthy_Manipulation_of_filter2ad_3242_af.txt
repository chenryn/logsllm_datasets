Appendix-A: Taxi Route Visualization
Figure 9 visualizes the 600 taxi routes in Manhattan
and Boston that are used for our evaluation. In our ex-
periments, the considered area in Manhattan is 10.64
km×7.38 km with a latitude range (40.7003, 40.7959)
and a longitude range (-74.0180, -73.9308). The con-
sidered experiment area in Boston is 8.52km×10.60km
with a latitude range (42.3134, 42.3885) and a longitude
range (-71.1435, -71.0149). As shown in Figure 9, the
taxi routes are concentrated in the downtown areas in
both respective maps.

Appendix-B: Attack Area and Grids
In the Targeted Deviating Attack, the attacker aims to di-
vert the user to a pre-deﬁned location. Our evaluation
metric will focus on hit rate. In the following, we brieﬂy
explain how to calculate the hit rate. For a given taxi
trip, the hit rate reﬂects how likely a victim route can by-
pass the attacker-deﬁned destination to achieve targeted
diverting. Figure 10 shows how we deﬁne the attack area,
radius r and divide the grids. Given an attack area with
the radius of r, the attacker can pick a grid inside the area
as the target destination. Hit rate is the ratio of the grids
that the victim can be diverted to over all the grids in the
attack area.
