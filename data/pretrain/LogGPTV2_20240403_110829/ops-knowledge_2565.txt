User: The website says:

Closing connections: Fabric’s
  connection cache never closes
  connections itself – it leaves this up
  to whatever is using it. The fab tool
  does this bookkeeping for you: it
  iterates over all open connections and
  closes them just before it exits
  (regardless of whether the tasks
  failed or not.)
Library users will need to ensure they
  explicitly close all open connections
  before their program exits, though we
  plan to makes this easier in the
  future.

I have searched everywhere, but I can't find out how to disconnect or close the connections.  I am looping through my hosts and setting env.host_string.  It is working, but hangs when exiting.  Any help on how to close?  Just to reiterate, I am using the library, not a fabfile.
Assistant: If you don't want to have to iterate through all open connections, fabric.network.disconnect_all() is what you're looking for. The docstring reads

"""
Disconnect from all currently connected servers.
Used at the end of fab's main loop, and also intended for use by library users.
