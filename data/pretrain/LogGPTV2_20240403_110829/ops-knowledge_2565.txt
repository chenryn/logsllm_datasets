The website states:

"Closing Connections: Fabricâ€™s connection cache does not automatically close connections; it relies on the user or the tool utilizing it to manage this. The `fab` tool handles this bookkeeping for you by iterating over all open connections and closing them just before it exits, regardless of whether the tasks have succeeded or failed. However, if you are using the Fabric library directly in your code, you must ensure that all open connections are explicitly closed before your program terminates. We are planning to simplify this process in future updates."

Despite extensive searching, I have been unable to find specific instructions on how to disconnect or close these connections. My current implementation involves looping through a list of hosts and setting `env.host_string`. While this approach works, the program hangs upon exiting. Could you provide guidance on how to properly close these connections? To clarify, I am using the Fabric library, not a `fabfile`.

**Response:**

If you prefer not to manually iterate through all open connections, you can use the `fabric.network.disconnect_all()` function. According to the documentation, this function is designed to:

```python
"""
Disconnect from all currently connected servers.
This function is used at the end of the `fab` main loop and is also intended for use by library users.
"""
```

To incorporate this into your code, simply call `fabric.network.disconnect_all()` before your program exits. This will ensure that all open connections are properly closed, preventing the program from hanging.
