User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I send an alert on CPU usage in Windows Server 2008 I am running Windows Server 2008 and frequently there is a single process that spikes the CPU usage to 25% or more and causes a lot of slow down issues. The server is being used remotely by approx 30 users and if I don't spot this problem quick enough it gets very frustrating for them when working. 

Is there a way to automatically monitor and report if this process becomes over active and causes problems? The actual process is an exe file that runs as part of a Web Application for PDA remote users.

Assistant: You can use Windows Performance Monitor to monitor the CPU usage on the server. You can then configure an alert for when it reaches a certain threshold. This article gives a good description of setting this up.

The Alert will let you either log this to the event log, send a netsend message, or more useful, run a program. You can then configure this to run a script or batch file that will send an email, or pager, or your favourite notification method.
