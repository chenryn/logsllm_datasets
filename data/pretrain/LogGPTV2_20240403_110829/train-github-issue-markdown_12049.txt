Original report at SourceForge, opened Wed Sep 1 04:54:13 2010
instead of only:  
plt.figure(1)  
the following:  
plt.figure('today')  
would open a figure called 'today' instead of 'figure 1'
Example usage: when opening a lot of tabbed figures (in Spyder) it would help
if the tabs have meaningful names.

and not all that difficult to do.
you just need to ensure that the identifier remains unique.
