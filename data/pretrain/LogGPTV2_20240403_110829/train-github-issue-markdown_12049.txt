#### Issue Description
Instead of using the default:
```python
plt.figure(1)
```
which opens a figure labeled as "Figure 1," it would be more useful to allow custom labels, such as:
```python
plt.figure('today')
```
This would open a figure with the title "today" instead of the generic "Figure 1."

#### Example Usage
When working with multiple tabbed figures in an IDE like Spyder, having meaningful names for the tabs can greatly improve usability. For instance, if you are generating several plots and want to keep them organized, custom labels can help identify each figure easily.

Good idea, and not all that difficult to implement.  
Just ensure that the identifier remains unique to avoid any conflicts.
