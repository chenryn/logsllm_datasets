### Issue Description
This issue is occurring exclusively on the iPhone 12.

### System Information
- **Playwright Version:** v1.31.1
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu
- **Browser:** DEVICE_TYPE=iPhone12

### Test Code
```javascript
it("renders the component", async () => {
  await page.click("text=Go to page");
  await expect(page).toHaveSelector(".gotopage");
});
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Locator Resolved:** The locator for the "Go to page" text is successfully resolved.
2. **Click Action Attempted:** The click action is initiated on the resolved element.
3. **Element Visibility and Stability Check:** The system waits for the element to become visible, enabled, and stable.
4. **Element Status:** The element is confirmed to be visible, enabled, and stable.
5. **Scroll into View (if needed):** The element is scrolled into view if it is not already within the viewport.
6. **Viewport Check:** After scrolling, the element is still outside of the viewport.

### Actual Behavior
The element is outside of the viewport after the scroll action, which may indicate an issue with the viewport size or the scroll mechanism.

### Additional Information
- Please ensure that the viewport settings are correctly configured for the iPhone 12.
- Verify that the scroll action is functioning as expected in the test environment.
