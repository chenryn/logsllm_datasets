`rustdoc` exhibits an unusual behavior where it duplicates a doc comment when the comment is placed outside of an external module. You can see an example of this bug in action in the repository [alxgnon/docrepeat](https://github.com/alxgnon/docrepeat).

Previously, I addressed this issue for Rust's documentation with PR #13812 by relocating the problematic doc comments. However, PR #13812 does not resolve the issue within `rustdoc` itself. Therefore, I am opening this as a separate issue to address the problem specifically in `rustdoc`.

If you have any additional information or need further details, please let me know.
