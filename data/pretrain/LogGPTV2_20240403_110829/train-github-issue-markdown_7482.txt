`rustdoc` unusually repeats a doc comment twice when it is outside an external
module. Check out alxgnon/docrepeat for an example of the bug in action.
I previously fixed this issue for Rust's documentation with #13812, by simply
moving the problematic doc comments.
However, #13812 does not fix the issue with `rustdoc` itself. I am therefore
opening this as a separate issue.
