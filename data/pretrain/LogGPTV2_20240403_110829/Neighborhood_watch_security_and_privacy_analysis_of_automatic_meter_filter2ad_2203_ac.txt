### Figure 6: Aerial View of Eavesdropping Range and Terrain Variation

Figure 6 provides an aerial view of the physical range of eavesdropping and the terrain variation. The laptop icon denotes the location of the eavesdropper. Without a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA), the eavesdropper can decode packets sent by meters located at the blue triangles. When an LNA is added to the basic setup, the eavesdropper can collect data from a larger number of meters, indicated by the red stars. The underlying principle of increasing the receiving range is that an LNA amplifies the received signal strength (RSS) of each packet, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful decoding. 

To illustrate, Figure 7 depicts the RSS of a meter located 15 meters from the eavesdropper with and without the use of an LNA. The usage of an LNA significantly boosts the receiving range, enabling the monitoring of meters further away. While there are other methods to enhance the eavesdropping range, our intention was to demonstrate that the range can be increased using inexpensive hardware.

### Number of Observed Meters

To measure the total number of observed meters, we utilized two types of RF sniffers: a narrowband sniffer monitoring a 4 MHz frequency band and a wideband sniffer monitoring a 12.5 MHz band. The narrowband sniffer received packets from 72 meters without the LNA and 161 meters with an LNA. The wideband sniffer could receive packets from 106 meters without an LNA and 485 meters with an LNA, which exceeds the total number of apartments in the neighborhood (408 units). We believe some of the observed meters are located in the nearby region.

### Increasing Packet Reception Rate

We evaluate the packet reception rate using the number of received packets per hour (pph). A higher pph indicates more frequent updates on customer energy consumption and a higher level of information leakage.

Our observations show that while an LNA helps to boost the eavesdropping range and the number of observed meters, it also reduces the packet reception rates for meters that could be heard without an LNA. Ideally, a narrowband sniffer that monitors 4 MHz centered at 915 MHz can hear about 30% of all transmissions (40 pph), as meters typically transmit around 915 MHz. Without an LNA, we could receive an average of 6.65 pph per meter and a maximum of 27 pph. With an LNA, the average dropped to 3.96 pph per meter, though the maximum remained at 27 pph. The addition of the LNA undoubtedly increases co-channel interference (CCI), leading to more packet collisions.

A wideband sniffer slightly improves both the average pph (7.03 pph) and the maximum pph (30 pph). The less-than-expected improvement is likely due to the increased likelihood of concurrent transmissions in different channels colliding. The detailed distribution of pph for all meters is depicted in Figure 8.

### Methods to Increase Received Packets Per Hour (pph)

Several methods can be used to increase the number of received pph:

1. **Sophisticated Decoding Schemes**: Utilizing capturing effects, we can decode the strongest packet among collided packets if the RSS of the strongest one is above a threshold factor [24]. Advanced signal processing techniques such as successive interference cancellation and multi-user detection can be combined with multi-antenna techniques like beamforming and space-time adaptive processing [25].

2. **Monitoring the Entire Frequency Range**: A platform that monitors the entire frequency range can capture packets transmitted across all channels. However, this requires a very powerful computer to process the data and/or significant algorithm refinement to decode concurrent transmissions, which are outside the scope of our effort.

3. **Dedicated RF Sniffers**: A narrowband RF sniffer can hop through the same channel sequence as the target meter to receive packets. Our experiments show that such a sniffer could achieve 88.5 pph when monitoring a meter 10 meters away without an LNA.

### Neighborhood Monitoring

Wireless monitoring allows for the inconspicuous gathering of meter readings from a large number of homes. By RF eavesdropping using a cheap antenna and a low-cost LNA, we were able to obtain an hourly distribution of power consumption in the authors’ neighborhood, as shown in Figure 9. Since the precision of the wireless meter readings is 160 Wh, each bar in the figure represents 160 Wh more consumption than the one to its immediate left.

For example, about 27 meters consumed less than 160 Wh per hour on average, indicating that the corresponding apartment units were likely unoccupied during our experiments. This is an example of potentially sensitive information that can easily be obtained on a neighborhood scale. In this experiment, we were only able to receive a few packets per hour (pph) for a large portion of meters. Methods to increase received packet rates are available, and therefore, finer granularity data and additional sensitive information from the neighborhood could likely be obtained.

### Inferring Household Events

We now study to what extent it is possible to infer detailed household activities and events from the obtained data. The lower update rate of 30 seconds and high packet loss in neighborhood monitoring may suggest that this is more difficult. Since no smart meters with fine-grained data are available in this neighborhood, we address this question by comparing our data with fine-grained data obtained from direct visual observation of the meter. To reduce the manual labor required in this process, we implemented two automated visual observation mechanisms: one using cameras to monitor the meter’s LCD display and another using infrared (IR) photodiodes to monitor the IR LED. These mechanisms serve as the baseline for comparing the level of privacy risks caused by wireless sniffing.

### Automated LCD Screen Monitoring

The LCD display shows the accumulated meter reading in digits with a resolution of 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) and the rate of consumption by a few 'dots' displayed on the corner of the LCD. The set of dots is turned on and off in a sequence, appearing as if a digital wheel is spinning. Once one watt-hour (Wh) is consumed, one of the dots toggles. To capture every 1 Wh consumption, our camera-based monitoring system tracks the changes of the dots on the LCD screen. Our system consists of a wireless network camera (AXIS 207W Network Camera) filming the LCD display and a laptop for data processing. Once the video is streamed to the laptop, the processing algorithm locates the area of dots, identifies every dot toggle, and generates an electricity consumption trace.

In our experiments, we mounted the network camera 0.3 meters from the meter to record its LCD display at 10 frames per second (fps). This rate ensures the recording of every dot flash unless a household consumes electricity at a rate higher than 18 kWh. Although our camera has to be located no more than 0.5 meters from the meter due to its low resolution (640 × 480), a higher-resolution camera can be mounted at a hidden location.
