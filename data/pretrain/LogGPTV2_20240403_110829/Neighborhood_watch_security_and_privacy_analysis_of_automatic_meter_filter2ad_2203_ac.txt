Fig. 6 provides an aerial view of the physical range of
eavesdropping and the terrain variation. The laptop icon
denotes the location of the eavesdropper. Without an LNA,
the eavesdropper can decode packets sent by meters located
at blue triangles. Once the LNA was added to the basic
setup, we were able to collect data from a larger number
of meters, denoted by the red stars. The underlying prin-
ciple of increasing the receiving range is that an LNA am-
pliﬁes the received signal strength (RSS) of each packet and
thus increases the likelihood of successful decoding. To il-
lustrate, Fig. 7 depicts the RSS of one meter located 15m
from the eavesdropper when an LNA was and was not used.
The usage of an LNA boosted the receiving range by several
multiples, which enabled us to monitor meters further away.
Granted, there are other ways to boost the eavesdropping
range, but our intention was to show that the eavesdrop-
ping range can be increased using inexpensive hardware.
The Number of Observed Meters. To measure the
total number of observed meters, we utilized two RF snif-
fers: a narrowband sniﬀer monitoring a 4 MHz frequency
band and a wideband sniﬀer monitoring 12.5 MHz. The
narrowband sniﬀer received packets from 72 meters without
the LNA and 161 meters with an LNA. The wideband sniﬀer
could receive 106 meters without an LNA and 485 with an
LNA, which is more than the total number of apartments
in the neighborhood (408 units). We believe some of the
observed meters are located in the nearby region.
Increasing Packet Reception Rate. We use the num-
ber of received packets per hour (pph) to evaluate packet
reception rate. A larger pph maps to a more frequent up-
date on customer energy consumption and a high level of
information leakage.
We observed that an LNA does help to boost the eaves-
dropping range and the number of observed meters, but it

from the receiver.
also reduces the packet reception rates of the meters that
could be heard without an LNA. Ideally, a narrowband snif-
fer that monitors 4 MHz centered at 915 MHz can hear
about 30% of all transmission (40 pph), since meters tend
to transmit around 915 MHz. Without an LNA we could
receive 6.65 pph per meter on average and 27 pph maxi-
mum, while with an LNA, we could only receive 3.96 pph
per meter on average and 27 pph maximum. The addition of
the LNA undoubtably increases the co-channel inteference
(CCI). Hence, our proof-of-concept sniﬀer sees more packet
collisions.
In addition, a wideband sniﬀer can slightly improve both
the average pph (7.03 pph) and the maximum ones (30 pph).
The less-than-expected improvement is probably because
the wider the receiving frequency band is, the more likely
concurrent transmissions in diﬀerent channels collide. De-
tailed distribution of pph for all meters is depicted in Fig. 8.
We will show in the later section that even at a low recep-
tion rate, it is feasible to identify sensitive information of
the residents, such as whether the residents are at home.
A few methods can be used to increase received pph. (1) A
sophisticated decoding scheme. For instance, utilizing cap-
turing eﬀects, we can at least decode the strongest packet
among collided packets, if the RSS of the strongest one is
larger than other packets by a threshold factor [24]. Further,
advanced signal processing techniques such as successive in-
terference cancellation and multi-user detection can be com-
bined with multi-antenna techniques [25] (e.g., beamforming
and space-time adaptive processing [25]). (2) Monitoring the
entire frequency range. A platform monitoring the entire
frequency range can be used to capture packets transmitted
at all channels. However, one would need a very powerful
computer to process data at the rate and/or signiﬁcant al-
gorithm reﬁnement to decode concurrent transmissions at
diﬀerent channels, which are outside the scope of our ef-
fort. (3) Dedicating one RF sniﬀer to monitor one meter.
A narrowband RF sniﬀer can hop through the same chan-
nel sequence as the target meter to receive packets. Our
experiments show that such a sniﬀer could achieve 88.5 pph
monitoring a meter that is 10m away without an LNA.
Neighborhood Monitoring. Wireless monitoring al-
lows the gathering of meter readings in an inconspicuous
manner from a larger number of homes. By RF eavesdrop-
ping using a cheap antenna and a low-cost LNA, we were
able to obtain an hourly distribution of power consumption
in the authors’ neighborhood, as shown in Fig. 9. Since the
precision of the wireless meter readings is 160Wh, each bar
in the ﬁgure represents 160Wh more consumption than the
one to its immediate left.
Consider, for example, that about 27 meters consumed
less than 160Wh per hour on average, indicating the corre-

sponding apartment units were likely to be unoccupied at
the time of our experiments. This is an example of poten-
tially sensitive information that can easily be obtained on
this neighborhood scale. In this experiment, we were only
able to receive a few packets per hour (pph) for a large por-
tion of meters. Methods to increase received packet rates are
available and therefore ﬁner granularity data and additional
sensitive information from the neighborhood could likely be
obtained. We will examine this next.

INFERRING HOUSEHOLD EVENTS
We now study to what extent it is possible to infer detailed
household activities and events from the obtained data—are
the risks similar to those of smart meters? The lower update
rate of 30s and high packet loss in neighborhood monitoring
may suggest that this is more diﬃcult.
Since no smart meters with ﬁne-grained data are available
in this neighborhood, we address this question by comparing
our data with ﬁne-grained data obtained from direct visual
observation of the meter. To reduce the manual labor re-
quired in this process, we have implemented two automated
visual observation mechanisms of a meter’s on-board LCD
display and infrared (IR) LED using cameras or IR pho-
todiodes, respectively. We considered them as the baseline
schemes for comparing the level of privacy risks caused by

corner of the LCD, as shown in Fig. 10. The set of dots are
turned on and oﬀ in a sequence such that they appear as if a
digital wheel is spinning. Once one Watt-hour (Wh) is con-
sumed, one of the dots toggles. To capture every 1 Wh con-
sumption, our camera-based monitoring system tracks the
changes of the dots on an LCD screen. Our system consists
of a wireless network camera (AXIS 207W Network Camera)
ﬁlming the LCD display and a laptop for data processing.
Once the video is streamed to the laptop, the processing al-
gorithm locates the area of dots, identiﬁes every dot toggle,
and generates an electricity consumption trace.
In our experiments, we mounted the network camera 0.3m
from a meter to record its LCD display and set the camera
at its 10 frames per second (fps). This rate ensures the
recording of every dot ﬂash unless a household consumes
electricity at a rate higher than 18 kWh. Although our
camera has to be located no more than 0.5m from the meter
because of its low resolution (640 × 480), in practice, with
a higher resolution, the camera can be mounted at a hidden
