Tuning Your Brain
 Why does certain music get you out of a black 
hole? 
 Often when we're stuck in a black hole,  or just can't 
figure the problem out - the right music will get us out 
of it. Why does this work?  It seems motivating, and it 
seems like we solve problems easier, and it seems to 
create a flow.  I'll be going over the basics of the brain 
structures, neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters, 
before getting to how music effects the brain, and how 
we think. 
Your Brain
 Your brain is made of cells called neurons 
 Neurons are in 3 basic parts
cell body
 dendrites [input] 
presynaptic membrane is 
polarized. 
axon [output] – 
movement along axon weakens 
as it travels
Could be seen as analog
Your Brain
 Neuron cells are cells are interconnected  by 
synapses.  from the neuron terminals [axon] to 
the membrane of the  dendrite. 
 Between the terminal of the axon and 
membrane of the dendrite is known as the pre-
synaptic gap

 Neurotransmitters
First discovered by Otto Loewi
There are approximately 100 billion neurons in the human brain.
Neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic terminal  and across to the 
receptor membrane on the dendrite. 
This causes either depolarization (excitatory – increased likelihood of firing ) or 
hyperpolarization (inhibitory- decreased likelihood of firing) of the membrane. If 
there is enough (action potential)– the charge passes along the axon to the 
terminal and the process repeats. Neurotransmitters  are inactivated after release 
– either through re-uptake mechanisms or enzyme action.
Neurotransmitters  are inactivated after release – either through re-uptake 
mechanisms or enzyme action.

Brainwaves
What are brainwaves? How are they  made?
 Records of the electrochemical transmission – polarization/ depolarization at the 
synapse, action potential at the axon and dendrite.
 Brainwaves frequencies are separated into 4 “states”
Beta (fully awake) – 14-40 cps
Alpha(relaxed) – 8-13 cps
Theta (deeply relaxed) – 4-7 cps
Delta(dreamless/unconcious) .5 – 3.5 cps
Brainwaves
  Stochastic resonance 
 Think Tuning Fork
“Today it is well established that noise plays important roles both in the encoding of sensory 
stimuli  and in the planning and control of certain movements. This paradigm shift was initiated 
by physicists over the last 25 years who studied the effects of noise on threshold-type devices, 
including neurons, to subthreshold inputs. It was shown that information transfer improves 
because noise increases the threshold crossing rate through a mechanism known as stochastic 
resonance”

Binaural Beats/HBPM Music
When a sound of a particular frequency is presented in one ear and a slightly higher 
or lower frequency is presented simultaneously in the other ear, the mid brain creates 
the middle frequency.
Binaural Beats have been very popular in neurofeedback
The beats can entrain brainwaves to their frequency via stochastic resonance. 
There is some suggestion however that Binaural beats are too fuzzy to be of as much 
use as any strong beat of the right frequency.
Music, particularly high beat per minute music, listened to on headphones – 
stimulates the brain and thru resonance decreases the frequency of brain waves. 
High bpm music translates approximately to Alpha/ Theta hz.
Changes heart rate.

Finding the Optimal Music
 Generally speaking, most biofeedback, binaural beats, and brainwave 
entraining technologies and theories tend to aim for Alpha or Theta state. 
These are the more relaxed states  often associated with learning and 
creativity. 
High bpm music translates approximately to Alpha/ Theta hz.
My guess is that it's better on headphones – other sound is cut out, and you 
get the added stimulation through the jawbone. 
Training your brain to respond – neurons that fire together will eventually 
always fire together
It’s all about you– what music works for you individually
