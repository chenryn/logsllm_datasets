User: How to monitor system resource usage and generate reports? Please provide an effective monitoring scheme and corresponding reporting format.
Assistant: 1. Monitoring solution You can use the following tools to monitor system resource usage: 1. top command: used to monitor the CPU, memory, IO and other information of the process in real time; 2. sar command: used to collect system activity information, including CPU usage , memory usage, disk IO, etc.; 3. vmstat command: used to monitor memory and CPU usage in real time; 4. iostat command: used to monitor disk IO usage; 5. netstat command: used to monitor network connection status and bandwidth Usage. You can use these commands to collect data periodically by writing shell scripts, and store the collected data in the local database in CSV format. At the same time, you can consider installing open source monitoring tools, such as zabbix, nagios, etc., for more comprehensive and automated monitoring. 2. Report format The system resource usage report should contain the following information: 1. CPU usage, including CPU usage, context switching times, interrupt times, etc.; 2. Memory usage, including physical memory and virtual memory usage, memory swapping 3. Disk IO usage, including disk read/write rate, disk IOPS, disk queue length, etc.; 4. Network usage, including network bandwidth usage, network connection status, number of TCP connections, etc.; 5. Other system resources Usage, such as system load, number of processes, etc. The report format can be in the form of a pivot table or a graph to more intuitively display system resource usage. At the same time, functions such as trend analysis and anomaly detection can also be introduced to help administrators discover abnormal usage of system resources in a timely manner.
