##### Detailed description
The rows are getting switched when I assign them to variables.  
`cv2.rectangle()` requires top left then bottom right so I know which ones
these are in my bbox[] list and can draw the rectangle. However when I try to
use the same coordinates for slicing, my `y`'s (which I assigned `y1 =
bbox[3]`, `y2=bbox[1]` are reversed with y1 being a larger integer than `y2`
so I have to slice using `y2:y1` instead. I am pretty sure that I printed out
`bbox[]` 0 to 3 as well and it was the same so not sure why those coordinates
work for both `cv2.rectange()` and `plt.Rectangle()` but then not for slicing
in this case.  
I posted on datasciencestackexchange about it:

of-x-y-coordinates-in-numpy-image-array?noredirect=1#comment63897_58308
##### Steps to reproduce
python code, please look at cv2.rectangle() at the bottom of the function so
you know what top left and bottom of bbox are:
