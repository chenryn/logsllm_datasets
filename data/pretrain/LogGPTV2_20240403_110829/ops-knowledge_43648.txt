User: How to divide IP subnet in network topology?
Assistant: IP subnetting is the process of splitting a large network into several small networks, which can improve network flexibility, reduce the scope of broadcast domains, and enhance network performance. The following steps can be followed when dividing IP subnets: 1. Determine the subnet mask: The subnet mask is used to distinguish between network addresses and host addresses, and determines which bits in the IP address are network addresses and which bits are host addresses. Calculating the subnet mask requires knowing how many subnets there are in the network to be divided and how many hosts each subnet has at most. 2. Determine the number of subnets: Determine the number of subnets to be divided according to the network scale and requirements, and assign a unique subnet number to each subnet. 3. Assign IP address: assign a unique IP address for each host in the subnet, including network address and host address. 4. Configure routing: Configure routers to connect each subnet to achieve communication between subnets. 5. Test network: Perform a network test on the divided subnets to ensure normal communication between subnets. In general, IP subnetting requires careful planning and setting of network scale, number of subnets, and subnet mask, as well as configuration of routers and network testing to ensure network stability and performance.
