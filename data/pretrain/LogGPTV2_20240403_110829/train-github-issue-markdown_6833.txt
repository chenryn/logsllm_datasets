**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : kops-deployed running on aws
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): debian
**What happened** : when I do `kubectl -f apply my-scheduled-job.yml` without
that job being present, everything works ok, but when I apply an already
existing job, I get a "no kind "ScheduledJob" is registered for version
"batch/v1"".
If you are not able to reproduce it, I can provide my job, but it's a pretty
straightforward one, not a lot of options
