Using function shorthand in Object literals:
    var store = {
      save() { },
      load() { },
      delete() { },
    }
Generates this JavaScript
    "use strict";
    var store = {
      save: function save() {},
      load: function load() {},
      "delete": function delete() {} };
The problem is here â€” delete is a reserved word and cannot be used as an
identifier name in function declarations:
      "delete": function delete() {} };
