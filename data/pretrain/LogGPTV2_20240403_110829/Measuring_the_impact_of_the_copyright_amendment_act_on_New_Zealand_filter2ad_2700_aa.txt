## Abstract
The Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act 2011 (CAA) is a New Zealand law that provides copyright holders with legal recourse against illegal content sharing over the Internet. This paper presents a study of residential DSL user behavior using packet traces captured at a New Zealand ISP before, shortly after, and several months after the CAA's implementation. We used libprotoident to classify the observed traffic based on the application protocol to identify and examine any changes in traffic patterns. Our findings indicate a significant decline in peer-to-peer (P2P) application usage once the CAA was in effect, suggesting a strong correlation. Additionally, we observed an increase in tunneling, secure file transfer, and remote access traffic among a small segment of users, which may indicate an increased use of foreign seedboxes to bypass the CAA's jurisdiction.

## 1. Introduction
The use of Internet file-sharing technologies for copyright infringement has garnered significant attention from lawmakers worldwide. Countries such as France, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have enacted legislation allowing for a graduated response to online copyright infringement, often employing a "three-strikes" approach where repeat offenders may face internet disconnection.

On September 1, 2011, New Zealand implemented the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act (CAA), which introduces a similar graduated response system. Copyright owners can notify the user's ISP if they believe a subscriber has breached copyright. The copyright holder must pay a NZ $25 processing fee (approximately $20 US) to the ISP, which then issues an infringement notice to the suspected party. After three infringements, the subscriber can be taken to the New Zealand Copyright Tribunal, where fines up to NZ$15,000 may be imposed. The law also includes a provision (currently inactive) for terminating the internet connection of offending subscribers.

The CAA received extensive media coverage, and most New Zealand internet users were aware of the new law by the time it came into effect. However, media reports varied regarding the law's impact on user behavior. One major New Zealand ISP reported a 10% decrease in P2P traffic, another noted a decline in international traffic but could not attribute it to file sharing, and a third claimed no discernible impact on traffic volumes. None of the ISPs provided details on their measurement methods.

To investigate the CAA's impact, we analyzed the application protocols used by residential DSL users in New Zealand before and after the CAA's implementation. We used packet traces captured from a single New Zealand ISP and classified the traffic using libprotoident, a traffic classification library. Our results show that P2P traffic more than halved by the time the CAA became active, suggesting a strong correlation between anti-file-sharing legislation and P2P usage. Traffic volumes also declined for newsgroups and encrypted transfers. Conversely, we observed an increase in protocols used for secure or private direct file transfers, indicating that some users may have changed their methods to avoid detection.

It is important to note that our study only examined a portion of New Zealand's internet traffic, and other factors, such as global trends, may also influence P2P traffic. Therefore, while our results suggest a strong correlation, further detailed analysis is warranted.

## 2. Related Work
Other studies have examined the impact of similar laws in different countries. Dejean [10] surveyed internet users in Brittany following the HADOPI law in France, finding that 25% of users altered their downloading habits, but less than 15% ceased using P2P entirely. Many who stopped using P2P moved to alternative forms of file sharing, such as illegal streaming. Danaher [9] correlated the introduction of HADOPI with changes in online music sales, suggesting that HADOPI had a measurable impact, as song and album sales increased significantly compared to other countries without similar laws.

Unlike these studies, we used internet traffic classification techniques. Traffic classification has been a popular research area, particularly for identifying and analyzing P2P traffic. Libprotoident, a lightweight payload inspection tool, was used to classify the measured traffic. This approach is similar to Aceto et al. [3] with PortLoad, though PortLoad is not publicly available and has not been used in similar studies.

For identifying and measuring P2P traffic, Per√©nyi [17] proposed heuristics for identifying P2P traffic from NetFlow records, though this method was limited to default port usage. Hu [11] developed behavioral profiles to identify BitTorrent and PPLive traffic with high accuracy. Other studies have used statistical and machine learning techniques to identify internet applications, but these methods do not offer sufficient reliability for our intended analysis, especially for P2P traffic.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Sources
Packet traces were captured using a passive monitor placed within the core network of a New Zealand ISP. The ISP offers DSL plans comparable in price, speed, and data allowance to most competing ISPs in the New Zealand broadband market. The ISP operates nationwide, attracting customers from across the country, making the dataset representative for our study.

The monitor captured all bidirectional traffic for a subset of the ISP's customer base using an Endace DAG 4.3GE hardware capture card. Each trace set was entirely contiguous, capturing all packets passing through the monitor during the specified periods (Table 1).

| Start Date | Duration | Incoming Bytes | Outgoing Bytes | Active Subscribers |
|------------|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Jan 2011   | 7 days   | 5,159 GB       | 896 GB         | 4,135              |
| Sept 2011  | 8 days   | 5,079 GB       | 919 GB         | 4,928              |
| Jan 2012   | 8 days   | 5,459 GB       | 790 GB         | 4,333              |

The timing of the captures was crucial. The traces cover three periods: January 2011 (before the CAA), September 2011 (immediately after the CAA), and January 2012 (medium-term effects). During the capture process, each packet was truncated to include only the headers up to and including the transport header, plus four bytes of application payload, to minimize privacy concerns.

We used IP ranges provided by the ISP to filter the captured traffic to include only residential DSL subscribers, as they were the primary target of the CAA.

### 3.2 Analysis
We developed a program using libtrace and libprotoident to read and analyze the packet traces. Libtrace is a trace processing library supporting multiple capture formats, and libprotoident is a traffic classification library that identifies application protocols using lightweight packet inspection. The version of libprotoident we used, 2.0.5, supported over 200 unique application protocols, including twelve P2P protocols, and achieved better accuracy than existing open-source deep packet inspection software [5].

The analysis program examined each flow starting and ending within the period covered by each trace set, reporting the number of bytes downloaded, uploaded, and the number of active subscribers for each application protocol. Due to the different durations of the datasets, the analysis and comparison of traffic volumes were based on the mean amount of traffic observed per day rather than the total amount.

Each application protocol was assigned to a category describing its purpose, such as Web, P2P, or Mail (Table 2).

Our dataset's static IP addresses allowed us to track individual subscribers over the capture periods, enabling us to investigate the number of active subscribers and their behavior.
