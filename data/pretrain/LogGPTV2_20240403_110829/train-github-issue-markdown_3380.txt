Use of exclamation in an `ngIf` does not work when using null propagation
operator. It worked in beta-15, not in beta-16.
See plunker for demo:

(change to beta-15 to see difference)
Short version:
          With exclamation      
          With === false        
I could not find anything about this in the changelog - is this as designed?
