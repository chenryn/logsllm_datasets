### Issue with `!` Operator in `ngIf` When Using Null Propagation

In Angular, the use of the exclamation mark (`!`) in an `ngIf` directive does not work as expected when combined with the null propagation operator (`?.`). This behavior was observed to function correctly in Angular beta-15 but no longer works in beta-16.

#### Example
To see a demonstration of this issue, you can refer to the following Plunker:
- [Plunker Demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/2TGZ2XVESVQQJ1IN39AA?p=preview)

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open the Plunker.
2. Change the Angular version to `beta-15` to observe the difference in behavior.

#### Short Version
- **With `!` Operator:**
  ```html
  <div *ngIf="obj?.prop!">Content</div>
  ```
- **With `=== false`:**
  ```html
  <div *ngIf="obj?.prop === false">Content</div>
  ```

#### Additional Information
I could not find any mention of this change in the changelog. Is this the intended behavior, or is it a regression?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
