User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 large_table 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks whether the query related table is a root cause of performance issues. It considers two aspects: the size of the table and the number of tuples in the table. If the number of live and dead tuples in a table exceeds the tuple_number_threshold or the table size exceeds the table_total_size_threshold, then the table is considered large and added to the detail dictionary. If there are any large tables, then they are considered a root cause of performance issues. If there are no large tables, then they are not a root cause of performance issues.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- live_tuples
- dead_tuples
- table_size
