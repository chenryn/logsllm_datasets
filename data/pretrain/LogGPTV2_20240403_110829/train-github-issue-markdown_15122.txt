**Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
QueuePool do_return_invalid needs to _always_ decrement overflow, or
eventually (assuming max_overflow >= 0) you'll try to do a blocking get on an
empty Queue, and hang.
You can reproduce this with a DBProxy having a small pool_size,
max_overflow=0, and just get a connection + invalidate it until you hang.
It's more clear that "always decrement on invalidation" is the correct policy
when you consider that pool_size + _overflow represents the number of created
connections that will go back into the queue when released; an invalidated
connection should thus always result in _overflow -= 1.
