### How to Apply Global `MuiSvgIcon` Styles from the Theme in Material-UI

**I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.**

#### Expected Behavior
The `MuiSvgIcon` styles defined in the theme should override both simple `SvgIcon` components with paths and Material-UI icons. However, it currently only overrides the `SvgIcon` components.

For example, I expect the following code to apply the new styles to both:
```javascript
import SvgIcon from '@material-ui/core/SvgIcon';
import Add from '@material-ui/icons/Add';
```

#### Current Behavior
I have created a custom theme using `createMuiTheme` and attempted to override the `MuiSvgIcon` styles. The new styles are applied as follows:
```javascript
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  overrides: {
    MuiSvgIcon: {
      root: {
        width: 18,
        height: 18,
      },
    },
  },
});
```
However, these styles are only applied to simple `SvgIcon` components, not to Material-UI icons (e.g., `Add`).

#### Context
I am trying to apply consistent styling across all icons in my application, including those provided by Material-UI and custom `SvgIcon` components.
