**ATT&CK ID:** T1106  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Native API

Adversaries may interact with the native operating system (OS) application programming interface (API) to execute specific behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled and standardized way to access low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those related to hardware, devices, memory, and processes. These APIs are utilized by the OS during system boot, when other system components are not yet initialized, and also during routine operations to handle tasks and requests. By leveraging these native APIs, adversaries can perform actions that might otherwise be restricted or more difficult to achieve.
