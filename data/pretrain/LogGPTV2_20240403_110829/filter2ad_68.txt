ABSTRACT
The CAESAR competition is announced recently to iden-
tify such primitives oﬀering advantages over AES-GCM and
suitable for widespread adoption. 57 algorithms were sub-
mitted to the ﬁrst round in total and then 8 algorithms were
withdrawn because of various weaknesses. It has taken cen-
ter stage in symmetric cryptanalysis to evaluate the security
of remaining proposals in last few months, and several out-
standing work has been published at top conferences.
Raviyoyla v1 is one of the remaining proposals whose secu-
rity has not been evaluated formally. In short, Raviyoyla v1
is composed by an additive stream cipher motivated by the
eSTREAM candidate MAG v2 and a keyed hash function.
Due to the simplicity of the utilized operations, it performs
signiﬁcantly faster than AES. Furthermore, it can be opti-
mized using multiple CPU cores. So, it is quite competitive
in terms of speed. The designer claimed 128 bit integrity
for both the plaintext and the associated data in the design
document.
In this paper, we propose a method to construct forgeries
using a single query and the complexity is negligible. After
carefully examining the propagation of the diﬀerential in the
authentication part of Raviyoyla v1, we ﬁnd that the confu-
sion between two message absorption is far from enough. In
particular, if the diﬀerential is introduced to adjacent mes-
sages, its spread would be limited to a few cells with high
probability. As a result, the diﬀerential can be canceled out
by successive messages. Since the discussion applies regard-
less of the value of the diﬀerential, the value may be chosen
intuitively. We prove that the probability is at least 0.307143
for randomly selected values. Thus, one can make use of the
freedom in the diﬀerential to forge a large number of mes-
sages with a single query and the complexity is negligible.

Moreover, the probability can approaches one for elaborate
values by our experiments.
The following is an demonstration, where the length of the
associated data and the messages are set to 0 and 262 respec-
tively, and the key, the public number and the message are
set to zero. Furthermore, ∆m[4, 5, 256+3, 256+4, 256+5] =
δ is the diﬀerential between the forgery and the original mes-
sage. Thus, this table presents three forgeries constructed
from a single query in total.

The idea of this attack was ﬁrstly posted on an on-line
discussion group1 by us. Then, the designer proposed a re-
vision as a response. However, we ﬁnd the revised Raviyoyla
v1 should not be considered as secure neither. In fact, we
have found methods to construct forgeries for all possible
revisions from the designer. According to our experiments,
the complexities of these methods are negligible.
In conclusion, Raviyoyla v1 need further modiﬁcations in
order for the second round of the CAESAR competition.
With the current authentication structure,
it has to use
a strong hash function in order to minimize the probabil-
ity of diﬀerentials. However, that would aﬀect the perfor-
mance signiﬁcantly. Therefore, designers should avoid simi-
lar structure in general.
