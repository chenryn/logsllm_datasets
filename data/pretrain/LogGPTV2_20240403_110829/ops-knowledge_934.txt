User: I have searched online for a while for this question, and what I have done so far is 

installed python32 in homebrew
changed my .bash_profile and added the following line to it:


export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH

but when I close the terminal and start again, I type 'which python', it still prints:

/usr/bin/python

and type 'python --version' still got:

Python 2.7.2

I also tried the following instruction:

brew link --overwrite python

or try to remove python installed by homebrew by running this instruction:

brew remove python

but both of the above two instructions lead to this error:

Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/python

can anybody help, thanks
Assistant: From $ brew info python:

This formula installs a python2 executable to /usr/local/bin.
  If you wish to have this formula's python executable in your PATH then add
  the following to ~/.bash_profile:
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"

Then confirm your python executable corresponds to the correct installation:
$ which python or
$ python --version
