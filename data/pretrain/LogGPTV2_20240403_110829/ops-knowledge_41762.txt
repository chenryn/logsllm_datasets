User: How to set up Nginx reverse proxy to load balance among multiple web servers?
Assistant: 1. Install Nginx First, you need to install Nginx on the proxy server. For specific installation methods, please refer to the documentation provided by the Nginx official website. 2. Configure Nginx Open the main Nginx configuration file "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf", find the http section, and add the following content: upstream app_servers { server 192.168.1.10:80; server 192.168.1.11:80; } where "app_servers " is a custom name used to describe the load-balanced application server, where the IP addresses of the two servers and their listening ports are configured. Add another server section to set the pre-rules of the reverse proxy: server { listen 80; server_name your_domain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://app_servers; } } where "your_domain.com" is the domain name bound to the proxy server or IP address, forward all requests to "app_servers". 3. Restart Nginx After completing the configuration, you need to restart the Nginx service to make the configuration take effect: service nginx restart 4. Test Enter the IP address or domain name of the proxy server in the browser. If everything is normal, you should see the welcome page of the application server. Refresh the page multiple times, and you will find that each request will be sent alternately to the two application servers to achieve load balancing.
