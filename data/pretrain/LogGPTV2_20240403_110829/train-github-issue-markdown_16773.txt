### Description
  * Hello! I'm getting some bad behavior when using lax.scan to compute an exponential moving average over a time axis.
  * Specifically, the EMA function here is causing issues Here
  * The model exports to TF SavedModel (with enable_xla=False), but then we get an exception when running the model:
    [google3/third_party/tensorflow/python/eager/execute.py](https://colab.corp.google.com/drive/1FX99EPcaX-1mAVnpnpUQwkkR0WZ_6o3h#) in quick_execute(op_name, num_outputs, inputs, attrs, ctx, name)
         52   try:
         53     ctx.ensure_initialized()
    ---> 54     tensors = pywrap_tfe.TFE_Py_Execute(ctx._handle, device_name, op_name,
         55                                         inputs, attrs, num_outputs)
         56   except core._NotOkStatusException as e:
    InvalidArgumentError: Must have updates.shape = indices.shape[:batch_dim] + buffer_shape[num_index_dims:], got updates.shape: [1,1,1,16], indices.shape: [1,128,1,16,1], buffer_shape: [2048], num_index_dims: 1, and batch_dim: 4
    	 [[{{node jax2tf_infer_fn_/scan/while/body/ScatterNd_1}}]]
    	 [[PartitionedCall/jax2tf_infer_fn_/scan/while]] [Op:__inference_restored_function_body_8540]
which suggests some indices are being misplaced.
  * A couple observations:
  * The error occurs even when polymorphic shape is disabled.
  * When xla is enabled, the savedmodel works correctly.
  * Strangely, converting the SavedModel to TFLite seems to work out; the model runs and the outptus match the jax model numerically.
  * Minimal reproducing code is in my usual colab notebook of minimal reproductions Here
