speaking, a host conﬁguration is a subset of products.
2.3 Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are deﬁned in ﬁgure 6. Most of current attacks consist in exploit-
ing vulnerabilities that exist in entities of an IS. Shirey deﬁnes a vulnerability
as a ﬂaw or weakness in a system design, implementation, or management that
could be exploited to violate the system security policy [9]. Shirey’s vulnerable
system corresponds to an M2D2 product. However, vulnerabilities sometimes do
not refer to a single product: a host actual vulnerability may depend on the
combined presence of several products (a web server on a given operating sys-
tem for instance); a protocol design error may involve vulnerabilities in several
implementations of the protocol (see SNMP’s vulnerabilities CAN-2002-0012 for
instance (a.k.a BugTraq id 4088)). Arlat et al. deﬁne a vulnerability as a latent
error present on a target [10], a target corresponding to a M2D2 host. However,
it is not practical to model a vulnerable entity that way because each vulnerabil-
ity would require a dedicated relation or function between the host set and the
vulnerabilities set. In M2D2 a vulnerability aﬀects a conﬁguration (aﬀects). In
that way, a host is vulnerable if its conﬁguration is a superset of one vulnerable
conﬁguration.

The vulnerability set is built from the ICAT vulnerability database. More-
over, ICAT uses the CVE/CAN3 naming convention proposed by Mann [11] to
uniquely identify the vulnerabilities. The Mitre proposes a list of name equiva-
lences between CVE and other vulnerability names. This list is used inside M2D2
to cluster vulnerability names which refer to the same vulnerability (equiv). Ide-
ally, equiv should be an equivalence relation, but it is not in reality. As Mann
notices, the mapping between vulnerability names and CVE names is seldom one-
to-one, so a non-CVE name may be equivalent to more than one CVE names.
As a result, from one non-CVE vulnerability name, it is possible to get many
CVE vulnerabilities.
Modeling vulnerabilities actually requires that a classiﬁcation is established.
As a matter of fact, no dictionary of terms for describing alerts exists [6], but
alerts often refer to a known vulnerability. As a result, the information found
in vulnerability databases remains the only source of information for describing
alerts. One of the ICAT database strengths is that many attributes are used
to classify vulnerabilities. For alert correlation purpose, we have chosen the two
criteria which are described thereafter. Criteria can easily be extracted from
the ICAT database, they are common to all classiﬁcations and are relevant for
alert correlation, while remaining simple. For example, correlation may require
to detect if a privilege elevation occurred, or if several kinds attacks have been
attempted.

– Consequence (con) of a successful exploit of the vulnerability:
(cid:3) DoS: the exploit results in a denial of service.
(cid:3) InformationGathering: the exploit results in information disclosure.
For example, directory traversals and ﬁle reading fall under this category.
(cid:3) CodeExecution: the exploit results in the execution of arbitrary code.
For example, buﬀer overﬂows and race conditions fall under this category.
2.4 Security Tools
Security tools model is formalized in ﬁgure 7. Vulnerabilities can be detected
either when they are exploited by an attacker or simply when they are latent. IDS
detect the former, vulnerability scanners detect the latter. IDS and vulnerability
scanners are security tools.
Although they are part of the topology, security tools need to be explicitly
described in a security model like M2D2. Security tools are event producers
(see 2.5). Any security tool type should be integrated into M2D2. In the cur-
rent model, IDS are qualiﬁed by their analysis method (meth), either misuse-
detection or anomaly detection. Other security tools, like ﬁrewalls, will be in-
cluded in future versions of M2D2.
IDS detect, identify and generate alerts about active attacks in real time.
We distinguish two kinds of IDS according to their data source: HIDS (Host-
based IDS) and NIDS (Network-based IDS) (data). This dichotomy is based on
the topological visibility of an IDS: the topological visibility of an IDS refers to
the set of network components an IDS can monitor. NIDS (Network-based IDS)
read streams of events on a network interface (monitored interface), thus they
124
B. Morin et al.
can monitor many hosts depending on their location in the network. Whereas
a HIDS (should it be system-based or application based) monitor a single host
(monitored host), vulnerability scanners do vulnerability assessments on several
hosts, thus their topological visibility is modeled with the relation between a
scanner and a host (scans).
We also introduce the operational visibility of an IDS which refers to the
ability of an IDS to detect vulnerability exploits according to its conﬁguration4.
This is modeled by a relation (canraise) between an IDS or a scanner and a
report name. A report name is tool-speciﬁc, i.e the names of the reports are the
ones that are used by the tool that generates the alerts. Report names are linked
to one or more vulnerability identiﬁers (refersto). It is therefore transitively
possible to know which vulnerability exploits can be detected by an IDS.
The correspondence between report names and vulnerabilities are found, for
instance, in IDS signature ﬁles for misuse IDS.
It has to be noted that all report names do not refer to a vulnerability. As
a matter of fact, all attacks are not vulnerability exploits (port scanning is such
example). Some IDS can detect an attack but not recognize it as the exploit of
a given vulnerability, either because the attack is not referenced yet or because
the IDS cannot do so (case of the anomaly IDS).
2.5 Events, Alerts, and Scans
The event formal model is described in ﬁgure 8.
Both vulnerability scanners and IDS generate messages about the existence
or about an ongoing exploit of a vulnerability. The former is called a scan, and
the latter an alert. In the case of alerts, security tools should also generate the
events which led them to generate alerts.
Arlat et al. deﬁne an event as the instantaneous image of a system [10]. In
other words, an event is the manifestation of some activity the format of which
is discussed in this section. In the intrusion detection ﬁeld, event and alert are
generally two distinct concepts [12]. An event is a low level entity (TCP packet,
system call, syslog entry, for example) from which an analysis is performed by a
security tool. An alert is a message from an analyzer signaling that one or more
events of interest have been detected. We say that an alert is a kind of event,
since it reﬂects the state of an IDS. Such a deﬁnition is compliant with the
previous deﬁnitions and enables to elegantly model the fact that alerts produced
by an IDS may be the events from other tools’ point of view. In other words,
current IDS are low level event consumers and alert producers but future IDS
may be alert consumers and high level alerts producers.
M2D2 models alerts, scans, and the following event types: IP events, TCP
events, UDP events, HTTP events and HTTP log events. We restricted the event
types to the set of event types understood by most current IDS. However, M2D2
has to be extended with other event types such as operating system level events
and other network application protocol events, with their respective attributes.

Fig. 8. M2D2 model of events
The common attribute of all events is the timestamp (tstamp). The ID-
MEF [12] uses three distinct timestamps: detecttime (attack occurrence date),
createtime (attack detection date), analysertime (alert generation date).
Those three distinct timestamps depend on the nature of the M2D2 events:
a M2D2 IPEvent (cf p. 126) timestamp is a detecttime. An alert (cf p. 125)
timestamp is a createtime or a analysertime.
To model the aggregative nature of events, we introduce the partof relation.
This kind of relation models the fact that an alert can aggregate (encapsulate)
several other alerts or that an HTTP request is part of an HTTP log entry. This
relation may be reﬁned in the future if necessary.
In the remainder of this section, we give some details on some of the event
types (alerts, scans, and HTTP log events). Others are self-explanatory (the
reader may refer to the relevant RFCs).
Alerts. Alerts are formalized in ﬁgure 8.
Each alert has a single report name (reportname). Alerts are generated by
IDS (alert generator).
126
B. Morin et al.
As with IDMEF deﬁnition, alerts are caused by the occurrence of events
which are the manifestation of an attack (causes). Note that alerts may not be
linked to a causal event. This does not mean that an alert has no cause, but that
the causal information is not available (the IDS generating the alert does not
give this information, for instance). Alerts may also have more than one causes.
Finally, an event can be the cause of several alerts because:
– it can be shared by several alerts generated by distinct IDS, or
– IDS may generate several alerts for one single event. For example, the HTTP
request
GET /cgi-bin/phf?/etc/passwd may cause three alerts: one concerning
the presence of /etc/passwd in the URL, one concerning the presence of
/cgi-bin/phf and one concerning the success/failure of the request.
In other existing alert formats, source and target concepts are attributes of
the alerts [12,13]. Source and target implicitly refer to the source and target
of an attack. As events reﬂect the steps of an attack, we claim that the source
and the target concepts are hold by the events themselves. For IP events, the
source and the target are respectively the source IP address and the destination
IP address. Port numbers play that role for TCP events. The target information
may also be deduced from the location where an event was detected. This is the
case for all the events raised by HIDS, since IDS only monitor the host they are
running on.
Scans. Scan is a shorthand for “vulnerability scan”. A scan is a vulnerability
assessment provided by a vulnerability scanner (Nessus5 for instance) against a
speciﬁc host.
Like alerts, scans have a tool-speciﬁc report name (reportname). Scans are
generated by scanners (scan generator).
There are two major diﬀerences between scans and alerts. Firstly, scans are
not caused by events, since scans do not detect active vulnerabilities exploits.
However, it should be noted that to perform security tests, scanners generate
intrusive traﬃc which can cause IDS alerts. Alert correlation should take this
information into account.
The second diﬀerence is that while alert target information is carried by low
level events, the target is explicitly carried by the scan. Vulnerability assessments
are made against a host (scan host target) on a given port (scan port target).
IPEvents, TCPEvents, UDPEvents, HTTPEvents. These event types are
modeled in ﬁgure 9.
In Vigna’s model, a message is a triple (is, id, p), where is, id ∈ I are re-
spectively the source interface and the destination interface which belong to the
same link. p is the payload of the message.
