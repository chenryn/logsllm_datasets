# Steps to reproduce
Run FancyZones from the second monitor (on my machine it's monitor one, but
monitor two is the primary monitor).
# Expected behavior
The Choose Your Layout shows an overlay which should cover the monitor.
# Actual behavior
It's offset to the left by half the monitor width.. So all I see is the right
half of the overlay, overlaying the left half of the monitor. Other than that
it works, for example I can edit the layout (the right half of it), and when I
apply it it applies correctly over the whole monitor. Same if I select an
existing template. It's just the overlay experience that's offset.
