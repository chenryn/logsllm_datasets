### Issue with `@types/connect-mongo` and `@types/mongoose`

**Summary:**
I encountered issues while using the `@types/connect-mongo` package, which resulted in multiple TypeScript errors. I have attempted to resolve these issues by using the latest stable version of TypeScript and by adjusting the type definitions. However, I still have some questions that are not suitable for Stack Overflow. I would appreciate it if the authors of the type definitions could provide some guidance.

**Detailed Description:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - I created a minimal project to isolate the issue.
   - Installed the following type definitions:
     - `@types/connect-mongo`
     - `@types/cookie-parser`
     - `@types/mongoose`
   - Ran `tsc -p tsconfig.json`.

2. **Error Output:**
   - The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) produced numerous errors, primarily related to duplicate identifiers in the `@types/mongoose` type definitions. Here are some of the errors:
     - `node_modules/@types/connect-mongo/node_modules/@types/mongoose/index.d.ts(87,9): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'NativeBuffer'.`
     - `node_modules/@types/connect-mongo/node_modules/@types/mongoose/index.d.ts(88,9): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'NativeDate'.`
     - `node_modules/@types/connect-mongo/node_modules/@types/mongoose/index.d.ts(89,9): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'NativeError'.`
     - (and many more similar errors)

3. **Investigation:**
   - I noticed that the `package.json` file for `@types/connect-mongo` lists the following dependencies:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
         "@types/express": "*",
         "@types/express-session": "*",
         "@types/mongodb": "^2",
         "@types/mongoose": "^4"
     }
     ```
   - Given that I am using the latest versions of Mongoose (5.0.18) and MongoDB (3.x), this seems to be the root cause of the problem.

4. **Temporary Solution:**
   - I deleted the `./node_modules/@types/mongodb` directory.
   - Reinstalled `@types/mongodb`.
   - Deleted the `./node_modules/@types/connect-mongo/node_modules` directory.
   - This resolved the issue temporarily.

5. **Concerns:**
   - The original `connect-mongo` package.json file lists MongoDB v2 as a dependency and Mongoose v4 as a dev-dependency.
   - Despite this, my original project works well with the latest versions of these packages.
   - I am unsure whether I should update the `@types/connect-mongo` package or if there is a better way to handle this situation.

**Questions:**
- Should I update the `@types/connect-mongo` package to support the latest versions of Mongoose and MongoDB?
- Is there a more robust solution to avoid these duplicate identifier errors?

Thank you for your assistance.
