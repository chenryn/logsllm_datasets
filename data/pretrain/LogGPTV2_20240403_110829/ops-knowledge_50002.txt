User: I'm developing a Python application using wxPython and freezing it using cxFreeze. All seems to be going fine apart from this following bit:
When I run the executable created by cxFreeze, a blank console window pops up. I don't want to show it. Is there any way I could hide it? 
It doesn't seem to be documented on the cxFreeze site and Googling didn't turn up much apart from some similar sorta problems with Py2Exe.
Thanks.
Assistant: If you're using Windows, you could rename your "main" script's extension (that launches the app) to .pyw
