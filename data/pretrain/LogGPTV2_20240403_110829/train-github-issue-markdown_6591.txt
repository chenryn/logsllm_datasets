I am attempting to integrate AngularJS (ng1) with Angular (ng2) using the ngUpgrade module. However, I'm encountering a type definition conflict.

The specific error message is as follows:
```
error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.
Variable '$' must be of type 'cssSelectorHelper', but here has type 'JQueryStatic'.
```

This conflict seems to arise from the following sources:
- `angularjs/angular.d.ts` (from DefinitelyTyped: <https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/angularjs/angular.d.ts>)
- Angular 2 type definitions (bundled with npm)

Is it possible to use AngularJS and Angular 2 together in a TypeScript project, and if so, how can I resolve this type definition conflict?
