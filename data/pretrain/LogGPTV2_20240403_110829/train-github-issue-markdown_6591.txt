I'm trying to use ng2 with ng1 so use ngUpgrade.  
But type definitions conflict.
    error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type. Variable '$' must be of type 'cssSelectorHelper', but here has type ‘JQueryStatic’
  * angularjs/angular.d.ts (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/angularjs/angular.d.ts)
  * angular2 (npm-bundled definitions)
Cannot I use angularjs and angular2 together with typescript?
