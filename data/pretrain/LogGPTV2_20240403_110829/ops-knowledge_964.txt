User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题A computer on the public network I was using was penetrated at a codejam. Am I at risk? I was at a code jam today for 12 hours.  At the end of the day as I was leaving, one of the programmers claimed his computer was hit with a reverse shell attack.  He was voicing this as I was finishing up and I stuck around to get as many details as possible.  He was on a Linux system.  This codejam was labeled a "hackathon" but in reality it was just a programming event, with $10k in cash prizes on the line.  Now I'm worried that I'm at risk.

I was running a Django project server on my Windows 10 machine periodically throughout the day.  When the accusations of real, actual hacking were heard it turned into a murder mystery.  I turned on my VPN but I have no idea if that would actually do anything.  Is my computer safe?  Do I have to nuke it from orbit?  Excuse my naiveté, but I don't think anybody at the event saw my team as a serious threat or competition.  How can I check my machine to see if there are any signs of intruder?  I don't have a shell log to read.

How do I check to see if my Windows 10 machine was compromised in the time that I was on a network where other machines where allegedly compromised?

Assistant: The short answer, yes, you're always at risk. Should you be worried? Probably not, people like to be the center of attention and be charlatans, another time try to ask for technical details, how did he know that there were a compromise of his computer, what did he do to mitigate?

If your operating system and running applications was updated, you had newly updated security definitions for Windows Defender installed and haven't disabled your firewall you're properly safe. Also try to think it about it another way - what value do you have as a target?

If you still don't trust that you're safe, I would wipe my machine. You can do many things to try to get the feeling that you're safe, but if you're machine was compromised and infected with a rootkit or similar, you would probably not find it anyway.

For Django specifically you can find their security documentation here:
