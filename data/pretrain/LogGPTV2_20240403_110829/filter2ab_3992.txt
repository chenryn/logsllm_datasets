title:blackhat:asia-21 Hey, You, Get off My Private Data: Do Apps Respect Your Privacy as They Claim?
In recent years, we have witnessed many major companies being punished by regulators and legislations due to violation of personal data privacy. Some of the violations may be caused by misunderstandings or even complete unawareness of the data protection laws. In this talk, we will present our study on multinational data protection regulations and compliance assessment of massive apps. We will focus on whether apps give users control over their personal data, in particular, the right to be informed, to consent, to be erased and forgotten, and to acquire data portability. We developed a framework to assess the compliance of data protection regulations in Android apps. We will provide it as an automatic open-source tool for app developers to check their own apps. We also applied our framework to the Top-1,000 apps in the Google play store and other alternative stores, and surprisingly found that privacy violation is pervasive in them. We will present our findings and recommendations to raise an alert to all app manufacturers, among other stakeholders.
