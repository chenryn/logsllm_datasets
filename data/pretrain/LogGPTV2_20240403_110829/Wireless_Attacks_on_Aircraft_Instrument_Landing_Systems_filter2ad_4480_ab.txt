tude variation about an un-modulated carrier. The depth of
modulation is set at 20% and 40% respectively for localizer
and glideslope signals. The output of both the 90 Hz and 150
Hz modulator is then combined to yield two radio frequency
signals: a carrier-plus-sidebands (CSB) and a sidebands-only
(SBO) signal. The names of the signal directly reﬂect their
spectral energy conﬁguration with the CSB containing both
the sideband energy and the assigned carrier frequency while
in the SBO signal the carrier frequency component is sup-
pressed. The CSB and SBO signals are subjected to speciﬁc
phase shifts before being transmitted. The phase shifts are
carefully chosen such that when the CSB and SBO signals
combine in space, the resulting signal enables the aircraft
to determine its horizontal and vertical alignment with the
approach path.
Localizer. The localizer subsystem consists of an array of
multiple antennas that emit the CSB and SBO signals such
that the 150 Hz modulation predominates to the right of the
runway centerline and the 90 Hz signal prevails to the left.
In other words, if the ﬂight is aligned to the right of the run-
way during the approach, the 150 Hz dominant signal will
indicate the pilot to steer left and vice versa. The antenna
array of the localizer is located at the opposite end (from the
approach side) of the runway. Each runway operates its lo-
calizer at a speciﬁc carrier frequency (between 108.1MHz to
111.95MHz) and the ILS receiver automatically tunes to this
frequency as soon as pilot inputs the runway identiﬁer in the
cockpit receiver module. Additionally, the runway identiﬁer
is transmitted using a 1020 Hz morse code signal over the
localizer’s carrier frequency.
Glideslope. The glideslope subsystem uses two antennas
to create a signal pattern similar to that of the localizer except
on a vertical plane. The two antennas are mounted on a tower
at speciﬁc heights deﬁned by the glide-path angle suitable for
that particular airport’s runway. In contrast to the localizer, the
glideslope produces the signal pattern in the airspace based on
the sum of the signals received from each antenna via the di-
rect line-of-sight path and the reﬂected path. The mixing of the
CSB and SBO signals results in a pattern in which the 90 Hz
component of the signal predominates in the region above
the glide-path while the 150 Hz prevails below the glide-path.
The glideslope uses carrier frequencies between 329.15 MHz
and 335.0 MHz, and the antenna tower is located near the
touchdown zone of the runway. Typically, the center of the
glide-slope deﬁnes a glide path angle of approximately 3◦.
For every localizer frequency, the corresponding glideslope
frequency is hardcoded i.e., the localizer-glideslope frequen-
cies occur in pairs and the instrument automatically tunes
to the right glideslope frequency when the pilot tunes to a
speciﬁc runway’s localizer frequency.
2.1.2
The combined signals received at the aircraft are ampliﬁed,
demodulated, and ﬁltered to recover the 90 Hz and 150 Hz
components. A bridge rectiﬁer is used to convert the ampli-
tude of the recovered tones to DC voltage levels. The DC
voltage output is directly proportional to the depth of the
modulation of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones–a direct measure
of the dominating frequency signal. The DC voltage causes
the course deviation indicator needle to deﬂect based on the
difference in the depth of the modulation of the two tones
thereby precisely indicating the aircraft’s lateral and vertical
deviation from approach path.
ILS Receiver
For example, an aircraft that is on-course will receive both
90 and 150 Hz signals with the same amplitude, i.e., equal
depth of modulation and will result in zero difference in the
depth of modulation and therefore cause no needle deﬂections.
However, an aircraft that is off-course and not aligned with the
approach path will receive signals with a non-zero difference
in the depth of modulation resulting in a corresponding de-
ﬂection of the needle. The instruments are calibrated to show
full scale deﬂection if DDM > 0.155 or DDM  0.175 or DDM > VLOC90 and VAT 150 >> VLOC150, the resulting
DDM = VAT 90 −VAT 150. Thus by manipulating the amplitude
differences between the transmitted 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones,
the attacker can acquire precise control of the aircraft’s course
deviation indicator and the aircraft’s approach path itself.

signal with speciﬁc amplitudes of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz components
3.2 Single-tone attack
Single-tone attack is an attack where the attacker transmits
only one of the sideband tones (either the 90 Hz or the 150 Hz)
to cause deﬂections in the course deviation indicator needle.
In contrast to the overshadow attack, single-tone attack does
not require high powered spooﬁng signals. Recall that the
aircraft’s horizontal and vertical offset is estimated based on
the difference in the depth of the modulation of the 90 Hz and
the 150 Hz tones. As indicated in Figure 4, depending on the
offset either of the frequency tones dominates. In the case of
an overshadow attack, the spooﬁng signal was constructed
with all the necessary frequency components. However, in
the single-tone attack, the attacker aims to interfere with only
one of the two sideband frequencies directly affecting the
estimated offset.
Attack Signal Generation. The working of the single-tone
attack is shown in Figure 6. The legitimate localizer signal’s
spectrum contains the carrier and both the sideband tones of
90 Hz and 150 Hz. As described previously, the amplitudes
of the sideband tones depend on the true offset of the aircraft.
In a single-tone attack, the attacker generates only one of the
two sideband tones i.e., fc ± 90 or fc ± 150 with appropri-
ate amplitude levels depending on the spooﬁng offset (e.g.,
left or right off the runway) introduced at the aircraft. For
example, consider the scenario where the attacker intends to
force the aircraft to land on the left of the runway with an
offset of 0.5◦. The legitimate difference in depth of modula-
tion will be zero as the aircraft is centered over the runway.
To cause the aircraft to go left, the attacker must transmit
signals that will spoof the current offset to be at the right side
of the runway. As shown in Figure 4, the 150 Hz component
dominates in the right side of the runway approach and there-
fore the attacker needs to transmit the fc ± 150 signal with an
appropriate amplitude to force the aircraft to turn left. For the
speciﬁc example of 0.5◦ offset, the amplitude of the fc ± 150
component should be such that the difference in the depth of
modulation equals 0.03 [20].
Notice that the single-tone attack signal is similar to
a double-sideband suppressed-carrier signal which is well-

known to be spectrally efﬁcient than the normal amplitude
modulation signal. Speciﬁcally, it is possible for the attacker
to reduce the required power to almost 50% of the overshadow
attack as there is no need to transmit the carrier signal and one
of the sideband signals. One of the important limitations of
the single-tone is the effect of the attacker’s synchronization
with the legitimate signal. To precisely control the spooﬁng
offset, the attacker needs to coarsely control the spooﬁng sig-
nal such that the phase difference between the attacker and
the legitimate signals remain constant throughout the attack.
We evaluate and show in Section 4.3.1 the effect of phase
synchronization on this attack. Additionally, the spectral efﬁ-
ciency of the single-tone attack can be exploited to execute
a low-power last-minute denial of service on the ILS system.
This is speciﬁcally dangerous while an aircraft is executing
an auto-pilot assisted approach. The block diagram of the
single-tone attack signal generator is shown in Figure 7.
4 Implementation and Evaluation of Attacks
In this section, we demonstrate the feasibility and evaluate the
effectiveness of the attack with the help of both simulations
and actual experiments conducted using commercial aviation-
grade receivers and an advanced ﬂight simulator qualiﬁed for
FAA certiﬁcation.
