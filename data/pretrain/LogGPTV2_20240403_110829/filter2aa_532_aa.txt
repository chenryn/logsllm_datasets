## Introduction
Welcome to *Advanced Wireless Attacks Against Enterprise Networks*. This workshop will delve into sophisticated wireless attacks on modern corporate infrastructure. Our goal is to learn how to leverage wireless networks to gain access to protected enterprise networks and escalate that access to obtain sensitive data.

While there may be some overlap with internal network penetration testing, this course focuses primarily on wireless attack techniques. 

## Lab Setup Guide
Before starting, please complete the lab setup guide provided with this document. Depending on your experience with Active Directory and VirtualBox, setup can take between two to five hours. If you encounter any difficulties, feel free to reach out to the instructor.

## Target Identification Within a Red Team Environment
### Chapter Overview
Effective wireless attacks begin with thorough reconnaissance. During a typical wireless assessment, the client provides a defined scope, including specific ESSIDs and BSSIDs. In red team assessments, the scope is more flexible, often involving the entire organization's security infrastructure.

### Scoping a Wireless Assessment: Red Team Style
We have four primary techniques for identifying in-scope wireless targets:

#### Linguistic Inference
This involves identifying access points with ESSIDs that are linguistically similar to the client's identifiers. For example, if you see an ESSID like "EvilCorp-guest," it is likely in-scope. Conversely, an ESSID like "US Department of Fear" should be avoided.

#### Sequential BSSID Patterns
Sequential BSSIDs (e.g., `1C:7E:E5:E2:EF:D9`, `1C:7E:E5:E2:EF:D8`) often indicate they belong to the same network. If one BSSID is in-scope, the others in the sequence are likely in-scope as well.

#### OUI Prefixes
The first three octets of a MAC address identify the manufacturer. If the client uses specific hardware, focus on APs with corresponding OUI prefixes.

#### Using Geographic Cross-Referencing to Identify In-Scope Access Points
If the same ESSIDs appear at multiple client locations and no third party is present at both, it is safe to conclude that the ESSID is used by the client.

### Expanding the Scope by Identifying Sequential BSSIDs
To identify hidden ESSIDs, deauthenticate one or more clients from each hidden network. Use the following command:
```bash
aireplay-ng --deauth 1 -a [BSSID] -c [Client MAC] [Interface]
```
If successful, the ESSID will appear in the airodump-ng output.

## Attacking and Gaining Entry to WPA2-EAP Wireless Networks
### Chapter Overview
This chapter covers advanced techniques for attacking WPA2-EAP networks, including evil twin attacks and practical exercises.

### Wireless Theory: Evil Twin Attacks
An evil twin attack involves setting up a rogue access point that mimics a legitimate one, tricking users into connecting to it.

### Wireless Theory: WPA2-EAP Networks
WPA2-EAP networks use Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for authentication, providing stronger security than WPA2-PSK.

### Evil Twin Attack Using Hostapd-WPE
Hostapd-WPE is a tool for creating rogue access points. It can be configured to mimic a target network and capture credentials.

### Lab Exercise: Evil Twin Attack Against WPA2-PEAP
Follow the steps in the lab exercise to set up and execute an evil twin attack against a WPA2-PEAP network.
