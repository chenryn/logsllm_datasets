### Real-World Application: Dennis Lynn Rader (BTK Killer)

Dennis Lynn Rader, known as the BTK killer, sent a floppy disk to the Wichita Police Department containing a Microsoft Word document related to his crimes. The police analyzed the metadata of this document and discovered that it was created by a user named "Dennis." Additionally, the metadata revealed links to a Lutheran church. By conducting Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) searches on these two pieces of information, the police were able to identify and arrest the suspect.
