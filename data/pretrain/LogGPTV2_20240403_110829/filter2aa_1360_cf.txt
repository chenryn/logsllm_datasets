Real World Application: Dennis Lynn Rader, also known as the BTK killer, sent a floppy disk to the Wichita 
Police Department containing a Microsoft Word document in reference to his killings. The police examined the 
metadata of this document and determined chat it was made by a subject named "Dennis". Unks to a Lutheran 
church were also located within this data. Conducting OSINT searches on these two pieces of information 
helped to identify- the suspect and make an arrest.

Google has scanned most books printed within the past decade and the index is searchable. Many of these scans 
also include a digital preview of the content. A direct URL query appears as follows.
The Internet Archive possesses massive collections of text files, books, and other documents. These files can 
be accessed with the "=TXT" parameter after a search. A direct URL for documents mentioning 
"inteltechniques" within the tide or content would be the following.
1 am hesitant to present this resource, but I have found it extremely valuable in my investigations. Many people 
use a service called Library' Genesis to download illegal pirated e-books. Library' Genesis does not offer any type 
of indexing of content, but Z-Library acquires all of their content and provides a search interface. This allows 
us to search within the content of millions of pirated books without actually downloading any content. The 
following URL would query "michael bazzell" within the entire collection.
Figure 20.03 displays a search result identifying the book and an excerpt of text from the query'. This allows us 
to find references to specific targets within publications. While it may be tempting to download the PDF of the 
book, please don't. This likely violates your laws, policies, or ethics.
You may occasionally locate a PDF file that has not been indexed for the text content. These types of PDF files 
will not allow you to copy and paste any of the text. This could be due to poor scanning techniques or to 
purposely prohibit outside use of the content. You may desire to capture this text for a summary report These 
files can be uploaded to Free OCR and converted to text documents. OCR is an acronym for optical character 
recognition. Basically, a computer "reads" the document and determines what the text is inside the content. The 
result is a new document with copy and paste capability.

I have never had an investigation rely on book sale information, but I find it interesting. Amazon offers a lookup 
tool which displays details about the number of copies being sold of any book on their site. First, you must 
identify the ASIN assigned to the book. This is typically visible within the details section of the book's listing 
page. The previous edition of this book is B08RRDTFF9. The following URL accesses all available details.
The details of rental vehicles are not technically documents, but the data seemed to fit this category the best 
The following options have been controversiaUy received during training and may not be appropriate for 
everyone. I present these methods to you as theories, and you should evaluate if the techniques are suitable for 
your research. Several vehicle rental companies offer an option to access your receipts online. This is probably 
designed for customers that leave a vehicle at the business after hours and later need a receipt. While the 
processes to retrieve these documents are designed to only obtain your own records, it is easy to view others.
This sendee requires a last name and either a driver's license number or credit card number.
At the bottom of every’ Enterprise web page is an option to "Get a receipt". Clicking this will present a form 
that must be completed before display of any details. Enterprise will need the driver's license number and last 
name. Proriding this information will display the user's entire rental history’ for the past six months to three 
years. Testing with my own data provided two years' worth of results. Each document will link to the entire 
receipt from that rental. These receipts include the start date and rime, end date and time, vehicle make and 
model, pick up location, total mileage, lease name, and form of pay’ment This information could be very 
beneficial to any drug case or private investigation.
Alamo titles their receipt retrieval link "Past Trips/Receipts" and it is located in the bottom portion of every 
page. The process is identical to the previous two examples. The only difference is that you must choose a date 
range. I usually select a start date of one year prior to the current date and the end date of the current date.
By visiting this page, you can access the fee I pay’ to Amazon for each sale ($7.90); the fee I pay’ to Amazon for 
fulfillment ($5.84); the fee I pay’ to Amazon for royalties (40%); the "Listing Quality’" (Poor); Potential sales 
(Low); Estimated Daily’ Sales (11-13 books); Estimated Daily’ Income ($447.00 - $528.00); Main Search 
Keywords (open source intelligence techniques); and Amazon Buyer Keywords (100 techniques americas test 
kitchen). As you can see with that last entry’, these results are not all accurate. Well, maybe the Potential Sales 
entry’ (Low). I never believe everything 1 see here, but it can be an indicator of sales versus a competing book.

Thanks to cameras on every data cellular phone, digital photograph uploads are extremely common among 
social network users. These images can create a whole new element to the art of open source intelligence analysis. 
This chapter will identify various photo sharing websites as well as specific search techniques. Later, photo 
metadata will be explained that can uncover a new level of information including the location where the picture 
was taken; die make, model, and serial number of the camera; original uncropped views of the photos; and even 
a collection of other photos online taken with the same camera. After reading this information, you should 
question if your online photos should stay online.
One of the more powerful reverse image search services is through Google. Rolled out in 2011, this service is 
often overlooked. On any Google Images page, there is a search field. Inside of this field on the far right is a
Similar to Google, Bing also offers an image search. While it is not as beneficial as the Google option, it should 
never be overlooked. On several occasions, I have located valuable pictorial evidence on Bing that was missing 
from Google results. The function is identical, and you can filter search results by date, size, color, type, and 
license type. When searching for relevant data about a target, I tty' to avoid any filters unless absolutely necessary. 
In general, we always want more data, not less. The search techniques explained in Chapter Nine all apply to 
queries on Google Images and Bing Images.
Advancements in computer processing power and image analysis software have made reverse image searching 
possible on several sites. While a standard search online involves entering text into a search engine for related 
results, a reverse image search provides an image to a search engine for analysis. The results will vary’ depending 
on the site used. Some will identify identical images that appear on other websites. This can 
other websites on which the target used the same image. If you have a photo of a target 
reverse analysis of that photo may’ provide other websites on which the target used the same 
be results that were not identified through a standard search engine. Occasionally, a target may create a website 
as an alias, but use an actual photo of himself. Unless you knew the alias name, you would never find the site. 
Searching for the site by' the image may be the only way to locate the profile of the alias. Some reverse image 
sites go further and try to identify other photos of the target that are similar enough to be matched. Some will 
even try’ to determine the sex and age of the subject in the photo based on the analysis of the image. This type 
of analysis was once limited to expensive private solutions. Now, these services are free to the public.
During my live training sessions, I always encourage attendees to avoid individual searches on various photo 
sharing websites such as Flickr or Tumblr. This is because most of these searchable sites have already been 
indexed by Google and other search engines. Conducting a search for "Oakland Protest" on Flickr will only 
identify images on that specific service that match. However, conducting the same search on Google Images 
will identify photos that match the terms on Flickr and hundreds of additional services. Similar to Google's 
standard search results, y’ou can use the Search Tools to filter by date. Additionally, you can further isolate target 
images by' size, color, and ty'pe, such as photographs versus line drawings. I no longer conduct manual searches 
across the numerous photo sharing sites. Instead, I start with Google Images.
Bing Reverse Image Match (bing.com/images)
TinEye (tineye.com)
Yandex Images (yandex.ru/imagcs)
Baidu Images (image.baidu.com)
338 Chapter 21
Similar to Yandex, the Chinese search engine Baidu offers a reverse image search. Baidu currently offers no 
English version of their website and only presents Chinese text. Navigating to the above website offers a search 
box that contains a small camera icon to the right. Clicking this presents options for uploading an image (button 
to left) or providing the URL of an online image within the search field itself. The results will identify similar 
images on websites indexed by Baidu. Figure 21.01 (fifth) displays the search page only available in Chinese. In 
my experience, this reverse search option fails more than it functions.
TinEye is another site that will perform a reverse image analysis. These results tend to focus on exact duplicate 
images. The results here are usually fewer than chose found with Google. Since each sendee often finds images 
the others do not, all should be searched when using this technique. Figure 21.01 (third) displays the search 
menu. The icon on the left prompts the user to provide a location on the hard drive for image upload while the 
search field xvill accept a URL.
Russian search site Yandex has an image search option that can conduct a reverse image search. Similar to the 
other methods, enter the full address of the online image of interest and search for duplicate images on additional 
websites. In 2015, Yandex began allowing users to upload an image from their computers. In 2020, I began 
noticing accurate results from Yandex which were not visible in results from Google, Bing, or TinEye. Today, 
Yandex may be your best reverse image search option. Figure 21.01 (fourth) displays the reverse image search 
icon in the far-right portion.
In 2014, Bing launched its own reverse image search option tided ’’Visual Search’’. This feature can be launched 
from within any page on Bing Images by clicking the camera icon to the right of the search field. Figure 21.01 
(second) displays diis option. This service does not seem to be as robust as Google’s. In my experience, I often 
receive either much fewer results, although they do match. On a few occasions, I have received matched images 
that Google did not locate.
light grey camera icon that appears slightly transparent Figure 21.01 (first) displays this search field. Clicking on 
this icon will open a new search window that will allow for either a web address of an online image, or an upload 
of an image file on your computer. In order to take advantage of the online search, you must have the exact link 
to the actual photo online. Locating an image within a website is not enough. You will want to see the image in 
a web browser by itself, and then copy the address of die image. If 1 want to view the image from the actual 
location, 1 must right-click on the image and select "view image" with my Firefox browser. Chrome users will 
see "open image in new tab" and Internet Explorer users will see "properties" which will identify the URL of 
the image. This link is what you want in order to conduct a reverse image analysis. If you paste this link in the
