### Table 8: Classification Results for Mixed DGAs and bNXDs from Siemens

This table presents the results of classifying mixed algorithmically generated domains (mAGDs) and benign non-existent domains (bNXDs) from the Siemens dataset. The classification was performed using 5 repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation on 20 sets, each containing 100,000 samples, with Random Forests (RFs).

### Generalization to Different Networks

In this section, we first demonstrate that FANCI maintains its performance when trained and deployed in different networks. Second, we show that it is feasible to train the model with data from one network and deploy it in another, indicating that FANCI generalizes well to new environments.

#### Mixed DGAs; Training and Prediction on Siemens Data

To illustrate that FANCI's detection capabilities are independent of a specific network, we repeated the mixed DGA experiment from Section 5.2.2 but used bNXDs from the Siemens dataset. The results show comparable accuracy to those obtained with RWTH Aachen data. The mean accuracy (ACC) is 0.99699, with a small standard deviation of 0.00015. The minimum ACC is 0.99681, and the maximum is 0.99730. Table 8 provides detailed detection performance metrics for the Siemens network data.

### Cross-Network Generalization Experiments

Next, we conducted two experiments to evaluate how well our trained classifiers generalize to unknown networks. Specifically, we examined the scenario where a classifier is trained on data from one network and then used in another network.

#### Table 9: Classification Accuracy for Training on RWTH Aachen Data and Prediction on Siemens Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ACC    | 0.99785 |
| TPR    | 0.99946 |
| TNR    | 0.99624 |
| FNR    | 0.00006 |
| FPR    | 0.00376 |

#### Table 10: Classification Accuracy for Training on Siemens Data and Prediction on RWTH Aachen Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ACC    | 0.99534 |
| TPR    | 0.99946 |
| TNR    | 0.99591 |
| FNR    | 0.00006 |
| FPR    | 0.00409 |

The mean ACC for training on Siemens data and predicting on RWTH Aachen data is 0.99534, with a small standard deviation of 0.00018. This is only marginally lower than the mean ACC for training and predicting on Siemens data (Table 8), with a difference of 0.00165 percentage points. The increase in false positives (FPs) is offset by a decrease in false negatives (FNs).

### Additional False Positive Reduction

As discussed in Section 4.3, FANCI employs a filtering mechanism in the intelligence module to reduce FPs. We evaluated the efficiency of this filtering approach using sets of all unique FP bNXDs from previous experiments. We considered both a global whitelist (Alexa top 100, top 10,000, or top 1,000,000) and local-specific whitelists for each network.

#### Table 11: False Positive Reduction with and without Local Specific Whitelist

| Network | Initial FPs | Alexa Top X | Local Whitelist | Reduction (%) | Remaining FPs |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| RWTH    | 6,522       | 100         | Yes             | 75.53         | 1,596          |
|         |             | 10,000      | Yes             | 77.69         | 1,455          |
|         |             | 1,000,000   | Yes             | 89.88         | 660            |
| Siemens | 11,431      | 100         | Yes             | 47.85         | 5,961          |
|         |             | 10,000      | Yes             | 53.12         | 5,359          |
|         |             | 1,000,000   | Yes             | 77.74         | 2,544          |

The results show that the filtering steps can reduce FPs by up to 89.88% for RWTH Aachen and 77.74% for Siemens, significantly reducing the number of FPs.

### Real-World Application

We applied FANCI to a one-month recording from the central DNS resolver of RWTH Aachen University, comprising 31 days from October 13, 2017, to November 12, 2017. The data included approximately 700 million NXD responses, with 35 million unique NXDs. FANCI was used with a single RF classifier trained on a set of 92,102 samples, including mAGDs from 59 different DGAs and bNXDs from the RWTH Aachen network.

#### Results

- **Unique Positive NXDs**: 22,755 (∼0.065%)
- **Total NXD Responses**: 45,510 (∼0.0065%)
- **Unknown mAGDs Identified**: 405, corresponding to ten different groups (either unknown DGA or unknown seed)

### Training and Classification Speed

To demonstrate FANCI's real-world applicability, we measured the training and classification speeds on a Dell OptiPlex 980 with an Intel i7 CPU and 16GB RAM running Ubuntu Linux 16.04.

- **Training Time**: 339.71 seconds (5.66 minutes) for an RF
- **Classification Time**: 234.76 seconds for 92,102 unknown samples
- **Time per Sample**: 0.0025 seconds, allowing FANCI to classify 400 packets per second on a single thread

### Successfully Resolved Domain Names

If a device is detected as infected by FANCI, it will eventually query for the IP address of its C2 server. Detecting such successful queries can reveal the IP address of the C2 server for the botnet. Our preliminary evaluation shows that FANCI can effectively separate mAGDs from successfully resolved domain names.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ACC    | 0.94962 |
| TPR    | 0.00071 |

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates FANCI's robustness, generalization capability, and efficiency in real-world applications.
