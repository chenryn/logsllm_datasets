**Issue: Encountering a "Segmentation Fault" Error When Running Anaconda-Navigator**

I recently installed Anaconda for Python 3.6, but I encounter a "Segmentation fault" error whenever I attempt to run the Anaconda-Navigator. I have tried launching it both by entering `Anaconda-Navigator` in the terminal and by navigating to the `bin` directory within my `Anaconda3` folder and executing it from there. The only method that has worked so far is running the `bin` folder as the root user. However, this poses a problem because I need to activate TensorFlow before running any commands, which is not possible when logged in as the root user.

I have already attempted to upgrade both Anaconda and the Navigator, as well as reinstalling them, but the issue persists. Has anyone encountered a similar problem or have any suggestions on how to resolve this?

**Solution: Adding `/lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**

I faced the same issue and was able to resolve it by adding the `/lib` directory to my `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. On my system, the Anaconda installation path is `/home/pushyamik/anaconda3`.

To add the `/lib` directory to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, you can use the following command:

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/your/anaconda3/lib
```

Replace `/path/to/your/anaconda3` with the actual path to your Anaconda installation. This should help resolve the "Segmentation fault" error and allow you to run Anaconda-Navigator without needing to use the root user.
