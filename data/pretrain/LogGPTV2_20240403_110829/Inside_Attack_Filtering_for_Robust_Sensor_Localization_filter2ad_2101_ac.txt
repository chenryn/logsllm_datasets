condition for the robust location computation when sensors
are under attack.
IV. SECURITY THREATS AGAINST HIRLOC
In this section, we explore the security threats against
HiRLoc, that can occur when sensors are deployed in an
untrusted environment. We show that HiRLoc allows sensors
to perform robust high-resolution location computation even
in the presence of malicious adversaries.
A. Attacker model
than its actual
We assume that the goal of the attacker, is to displace the
sensor, i.e. lead the sensor to a location estimation signiﬁcantly
different
location. Furthermore, we assume
that the adversary attacking the localization scheme wants to
remain undetected by the sensors, or the locators. Hence, we
do not consider all possible denial-of-service attacks (DoS)
attacks that will prevent the sensor from any location com-
putation. Note that our defense mechanisms are developed to
allow the robust location computation even in the presence
of malicious adversaries, and not to prevent the attacks from
interrupting other network protocols.

B. The Wormhole Attack
Threat model: In the wormhole attack discussed in [12],
[28], an adversary deploys a direct link referred as wormhole
link between two points on the network with a distance
longer than the communication range. The adversary records
any broadcasted information at one end of the wormhole
link, known as the origin point, tunnels it to the other end
of the link, known as destination point, and replays the
information into the network. Hence, the wormhole attack can
be launched without compromising any host, or the integrity
and authenticity of the communication and is difﬁcult
to
detect [12].
Wormhole attack against HiRLoc—antenna orientation
variation: An adversary launching a wormhole attack against
HiRLoc, records beacons at the origin point, and replays them
at the destination point, in order to provide false localization
information. Note that since in step 1 of HiRLoc, the sensor
determines the set of locators LHs that are within range, and
accepts future transmissions only from that set of locators, the
attacker has to replay the recorded beacons in a timely manner,
i.e. before the second round of beacon transmissions occurs.
Furthermore, the attacker must continue to forward all sub-
sequent beacon transmissions occurring at the origin point due
to the antenna orientation variation, in order to compromise
the majority vote scheme used in step 3, and displace the
sensor. For example if each locator performs (Q − 1) antenna
rotations, due to majority voting the attacker has to replay
more than Q|LHs| beacons corresponding to sectors that lead
to a ROI different than the sensor’s location.
In ﬁgure 4(a), the attacker records beacons from two origin
points, tunnels them via the wormhole link and replays them
to sensor s. Assuming that the attacker replays the beacons in
a timely manner, the sensor register as set of locators heard,
LHs = {L1 ∼ L13}. If all beacons updates are forwarded to
the sensor, 4Q sectors will intersect around the actual location
of the sensor, 4Q sectors will intersect around origin point
B, and 5Q beacons will intersect around the origin point A.
Hence, due to the majority vote scheme employed in step
three of HiRLoc, the sensor will be displaced in the area of the
origin point A. Note that replay from multiple origin points
does not increase the effectiveness of the wormhole attack
in corrupting the location estimation of a sensor, since the
sectors corresponding to different origin points do not overlap.

attack—antenna
orientation variation All beacons considered in the ROI
computation originate from locators Li ∈ LHs determined in
step 1 of HiRLoc. To avoid sensor displacement the sensor
must be capable of identifying the valid set of locators LH v
s
from the replayed one, LH r
s . Since the set LHs is deﬁned
before any antenna rotation,
to the
LHs determination in SeRLoc [18]. Hence, the mechanisms
developed for SeRLoc for identifying LH v
s can also be
employed in the case of HiRLoc. In particular the wormhole
attack can be detected due to the following two properties [18]:
this step is identical

(a) Wormhole attack—antenna orientation variation: an attacker records beacons in area B, tunnels them via the wormhole link in area A and
re-broadcasts them. (b) Wormhole attack—communication range variation: the attacker records and replays beacons from Li ∈ LHs that are not heard at the
sensor s when reducing their communication range.
1. Single message/sector per locator property: Reception
of multiple messages authenticated with the same hash value
is due to replay, multipath effects, or imperfect sectorization.
2. Communication range violation property: A sensor s
cannot hear two locators Li, Lj ∈ LHs, more than 2Rmax
apart, i.e. (cid:107)Li − Lj(cid:107) ≤ 2Rmax, ∀Li, Lj ∈ LHs.
The proofs of properties 1, 2 are provided in [18]. Due
to property 1, an adversary cannot replay beacons originating
from locators directly heard to the sensor s, since the replays
will use an already published hash value. For example, in
ﬁgure 4(a), if an adversary replays a beacon originating from
any antenna of locator L3,4 the sensor will already have
received a beacon authenticated with an identical hash value
from the direct link. Hence, the sensor can detect that is under
attack if any such replay occurs. Note that a replay due to
multipath effects or imperfect sectorization results in false
positives, and will be dropped from the location estimation
computations.
Due to property 2, an adversary cannot replay a beacon
originating from a locator that is more than 2Rmax apart from
any of the set of locators heard to the sensor s under attack. As
an example, in ﬁgure 4(a), if the adversary replays a beacon
from a locator that is more than 2Rmax away from any of the
locators L1 ∼ L4, the attack will be detected.
Based on properties 1, 2, it was shown that independent
of the location of the origin point(s), any wormhole attack
will be detected with a probability very close to unity [18]. In
fact, we were able to analytically evaluate the probability of
wormhole detection based on the distribution parameters and
the communication range of the locator R to be equal to [19]:
Pdet ≥ (1 − e−ρLAc) + (1 − e−ρLA∗
)2e−ρLAc,

4The locators use the same hash value to authenticate all beacons trans-
mitted at different antennas during the same transmission round, and the
transmissions occur simultaneously.

with l being the distance between the sensor and the origin

the
sensor can identify the valid set of locators LH v
s , using the
Attach-to-Closer-Locator (ACLA) method presented in [18],
and use only the beacons originating from the valid set to
compute the ROI. In ACLA, a sensor s under attack waits
for a small random time before broadcasting a nonce along
with its sensor Id, and then awaits for the ﬁrst authentic
reply containing the nonce. Locators that hear the sensor’s
broadcast reply with the nonce, their IDLi and localization
information, encrypted with the pairwise key K Li

closest locator always replies ﬁrst and is always directly heard
to the sensor under attack, the sensor is able to identify the
s as all the locators less than 2Rmax
valid set of locators LH v
away from the closest
locator and use the corresponding
beacons to compute a correct ROI estimate. Note that ACLA,
requires that the closest locator has not been compromised.
We will investigate the locator compromise in Section IV.D.
Wormhole attack against HiRLoc—communication range
variation: When HiRLoc is applied with the communication
identifying the set of
range variation option (Option B),
valid locators from the replayed ones is not sufﬁcient
to
prevent wormhole attacks. As an example consider ﬁgure
4(b), and assume that all locators L1 ∼ L4 are heard to
sensor s when they transmit with the maximum transmission
power. During step 1 of HiRLoc,

adversary being located at the origin point can record and
replay to the sensor up to (4N − K) beacons not heard to
the sensor and displace it.
Defending against the wormhole attack—communication
range variation In the case of the communication range
variation the detection method based on properties 1, 2 cannot
prevent
the attack as illustrated by the previous example.
However, we can still detect a wormhole attack using the
following approach:
Instead of computing the ROI after the collection of all
beacon transmissions, the sensor computes an estimate of the
ROI(1) by using all the beacons transmitted with the maxi-
mum communication range. The computation of the ROI(1)
is identical to the computation of the ROI in the case of
the SeRLoc [18]. Once the initial estimate of the ROI(1) is
computed robustly, any subsequent estimation of the ROI(j)
must intersect with the initial one. Since subsequent ROI
estimates are reﬁnements of ROI(1), if the sensor computes
a ROI(j) that does not intersect with the initial one, it detects
that it is under attack. Hence, an adversary can only hope to
displace the sensor within the region of the initial estimation
of the ROI(1).
In our example in 4(b), the sensor initially computes the
ROI(1) located around its actual location. The replay of the
beacons from the origin point generate a ROI(j) around the
origin point that does not intersect with the initial estimate of
the ROI(1). Hence, the attack is detected and the beacons
intersection in ROI(j) are rejected.
C. Sybil Attack
Threat model: In the Sybil attack [9], [13], [33], an adversary
impersonates multiple network entities, by assuming their
IDs. In a network where data are encrypted and the ID of
each transmitting entity is authenticated, unlike the wormhole
attack, the adversary has to both compromise the encryption
and authenticity of the communication in order to successfully
launch a Sybil attack. In HiRLoc, sensors determine their
location based on information transmitted only by locators.
the localization if it
Hence, an attacker can only impact
impersonates locators. In our attack analysis against HiRLoc
we focus on locator impersonation.
Sybil attack against HiRLoc—antenna orientation varia-
tion: In order for an attacker to impersonate a locator and
provide bogus beacon information to a sensor s, the attacker
has to, (a) compromise the globally shared key K0 used for
the beacon encryption, (b) acquire a published hash value from
a locator not directly heard by the sensor s5.
Once the attacker compromises K0,
it can record a
beacon from a locator not heard by s, decrypt the beacon
using K0, alter the beacon content, and forward the bogus
beacon to sensor s. Since the sensor does not directly hear the
transmission from the impersonated locator, it will authenticate
the bogus beacon. By impersonating sufﬁcient number of
locators,
the attacker can forward to a sensor s a higher
number of bogus beacons than the valid ones, compromise
the majority vote scheme, and displace s. In ﬁgure 5(a)
the attacker decrypts all beacons received from locators
L5 ∼ L9 and acquires the published hash values, during
all transmission rounds of the antenna orientation variation.
Using the hash values it can fabricate any desired beacon and
forward it to sensor s. Since the fabricated beacons are more
than the valid ones, the sensor is displaced at an arbitrary area.
Defense against the Sybil attack: Since the locators are
randomly distributed, on average, each sensor will hear the
same number of locators. Hence, when a sensor is under
attack, it will hear an unusually high number of locators (more
than double the valid ones). We can use our knowledge of the
locator distribution to detect the Sybil attack by selecting a
threshold value Lmax as the maximum allowable number of
locators heard by each sensor. If a sensor hears more than
Lmax locators, it assumes that is under attack and executes
ALCA to determine its position. Since ACLA utilizes the pair-
wise keys K Li
to identify the valid set of locators, the Sybil
s
attack will not be successful, unless the attacker compromises
locators. We will analyze the locator compromise case in the
5The sensor always has the latest published hash values of the hash chains
from the locators directly heard by it.
