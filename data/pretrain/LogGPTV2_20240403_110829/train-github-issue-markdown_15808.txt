We're currently upgrading a Symfony project to 3.4 on PHP 5.6.25 and my
colleague has been having this issue since I've added the following block of
code to our `AppKernel::registerContainerConfiguration` method:
            $loader->load(function (ContainerBuilder $container) {
                $container->setParameter('container.autowiring.strict_mode', true);
                $container->setParameter('container.dumper.inline_class_loader', true);
                $container->addObjectResource($this);
            });
It only happened on a second request, and often it had to be a different
request, not just the same one (aka refresh didnâ€™t cause it).
He found two ways to make it work :
  1. Commenting out the line `$container->setParameter('container.dumper.inline_class_loader', true);`, or
  2. Commenting out the line `$kernel->loadClassCache();` in `app_dev.php`
I personally can't reproduce the issue on my setup. Any idea what might be
happening here ?
Also, it might look like we're not the only ones :
