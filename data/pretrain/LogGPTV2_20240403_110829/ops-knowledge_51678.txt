Question: "A mobile device manufacturer is preparing to release a new Android device. As a security consultant, you've been asked to ensure that the device utilizes robust security features to protect against unauthorized code execution and persistent exploits. Considering the evolution of Android's Verified Boot feature, which of the following statements accurately describe the improvements made to Verified Boot since Android 4.4, and what should be included to align with best practices?"
 "A": "Verified Boot 1 introduced with Android 4.4 included dm-verity and enforced strict boot integrity checks to prevent compromised devices from booting."
 "B": "Since Android 7.0, devices are warned about corruption but can still boot, whereas Android 8.0 introduced Android Verified Boot (AVB) which merely standardized partition formats without additional security features."
 "C": "Android 7.0 introduced forward error correction to improve reliability against non-malicious data corruption, and strict enforcement of Verified Boot was established."
 "D": "Android Verified Boot (AVB) introduced in Android 8.0 is a reference implementation that works with Project Treble and includes enhanced rollback protection features to prevent downgrading to vulnerable OS versions."
