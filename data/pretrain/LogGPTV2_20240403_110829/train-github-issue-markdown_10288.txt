# Steps to reproduce

  * Install 0.17 (Bug / No UI)
  * Install 0.18 (no auto update detected)
  * Open settings
  * `Light` Theme is check <== This probably be `System` by default
Also as it indicated `Light` it was `Dark` (not sure if default is really
using `Dark` r `System`
# Expected behavior
Very first load of `Settings UI` should reflect the loaded/running theme
# Actual behavior
First defaulting does not match loaded theme  
Forcing to
  * System changed nothing (logic because System is using Dark)
  * Light synch to Light (Synch is now OK)
  * System (Synch is now OK)
# Screenshots
I can't reproduced without wipping installation / settings
