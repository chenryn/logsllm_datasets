### Report: Issue with Theme Synchronization in PowerToys Settings

**Environment:**
- **Windows Build Number:** 19631
- **PowerToys Version:** Manually updated from 0.17 to 0.18
- **Affected Module:** Settings Page

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall any previous versions of PowerToys and clear the settings storage.
2. Install PowerToys version 0.17 (Note: There is a known bug where the UI may not display correctly).
3. Manually update to PowerToys version 0.18 (Auto-update detection did not occur).
4. Open the PowerToys settings page.
5. Observe that the `Light` theme is checked, which should default to `System`.

### Additional Observations:
- The `Light` theme was checked, but the actual theme displayed was `Dark`.
- It is unclear whether the default theme should be `Dark` or `System`.

### Expected Behavior:
- On the first load of the `Settings UI`, the selected theme should reflect the currently loaded/running theme.

### Actual Behavior:
- The initial theme setting does not match the loaded theme.
- When changing the theme to:
  - `System`: No change was observed (since the system theme is `Dark`).
  - `Light`: The theme synchronized correctly to `Light`.
  - `System` again: The theme synchronized correctly to `System`.

### Screenshots:
- I am unable to reproduce the issue without completely removing the installation and settings.
