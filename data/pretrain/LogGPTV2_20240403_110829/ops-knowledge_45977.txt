Assistant: To use container orchestration tools to achieve flexible business deployment and expansion, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. When choosing an appropriate container orchestration tool, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc., integration, ease of use, and reliability must be considered. 2. Containerize each business, run the business code in the container, and package the container into a mirror to facilitate deployment and expansion. 3. Use container orchestration tools for deployment and management, define the size, network, storage and other attributes of containers, and combine multiple containers into an application. 4. Use the automatic expansion function of the container orchestration tool to automatically increase or decrease container instances according to the load of the application to achieve dynamic expansion. 5. Monitor the running status of the container through the health check and other functions of the container orchestration tool to prevent failures. 6. In order to achieve flexible business deployment and expansion, you can use the grayscale release, rolling release and other functions provided by the container orchestration tool to gradually release new versions and reduce risks. 7. Continuously collect the operation logs and indicators of container orchestration tools, monitor and analyze them, and optimize the performance and stability of applications.
