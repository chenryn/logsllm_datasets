you would recover to the second data center, recover from the flood, then fail back to the primary data center.
 Training and awareness. To maximize the effectiveness of your disaster recovery procedures, you need to have
a training and awareness campaign. Sometimes, technical teams will gain disaster recovery knowledge while
attending training classes or conferences for their technology. But they also need training about your organization’s
disaster recovery procedures and policies. Performing routine tests of your disaster recovery plans can be part of
such training. That topic is covered next, in section 7.13.
7.13 Test disaster recovery plans (DRP)
Testing your disaster recovery plans is an effective way to ensure your company is ready for a real disaster. It also helps
minimize the amount of time it takes to recover from a real disaster, which can benefit a company financially. There are
multiple ways of testing your plan:
 Read-through/tabletop. The disaster recovery teams (for example, server, network, security, database, email,
etc.) gather and the disaster recovery plan is read. Each team validates that their technologies are present and the
timing is appropriate to ensure that everything can be recovered. If not, changes are made. A read-through can
80
often help identify ordering issues (for example, trying to recover email before recovering DNS) or other high-level
issues. In a read-through exercise, teams do not perform any recovery operations.
 Walkthrough. A walkthrough is a more detailed read-through — the same teams look at the details of the recovery
operations to look for errors, omissions or other problems.
 Simulation. A simulation is a simulated disaster in which teams must go through their documented recovery
operations. Simulations are very helpful to validate the detailed recovery plans and help the teams gain experience
performing recovery operations.
 Parallel. In a parallel recovery effort, teams perform recovery operations on a separate network, sometimes in a
separate facility. Some organizations use third-party providers that provide recovery data centers to perform
parallel recovery tests. Companies sometimes use a parallel recovery method to minimize disruption to their
internal networks and minimize the need to maintain the IT infrastructure necessary to support recovery efforts.
 Full interruption. In a full interruption recovery, the organizations halt regular operations on a separate network,
sometimes in a separate facility. Many times, a full interruption operation involves failing over from the primary
data center to the secondary data center. This type of recovery testing is the most expensive, takes the most time,
and exposes the company to the most risk of something going wrong. While those drawbacks are serious, full
interruption tests are a good practice for most organizations.
7.14 Participate in business continuity (BC) planning and exercises
Business continuity includes disaster recovery, but it covers other things as well. Disaster recovery is a very specific series
of processes to recovery from a disaster. Business continuity focuses on ensuring the business experiences minimal or no
downtime (with the hope that a disaster recovery process won’t be needed). Think of business continuity as a strategy and
disaster recovery as a tactic. The bullets below detail the steps required to plan business continuity. Note that these steps
can be used to build a disaster recovery plan too.
 Plan for an unexpected scenario. Form a team, perform a business impact analysis for your technologies, identify
a budget and figure out which business processes are mission-critical.
 Review your technologies. Set the recovery time objective and recovery point objective, develop a technology
plan, review vendor support contracts, and create or review disaster recovery plans.
 Build a communication plan. Finalize who needs to be contacted, figure out primary and alternative contact
methods, and ensure that everybody can work, possibly from a backup location.
 Coordinate with external entities. Work with relevant external entities, such as the police department,
government agencies, partner companies and the community.

7.15 Implement and manage physical security
Physical security represents securing your physical assets such as land, buildings, computers and other company property.
 Perimeter security controls. The perimeter is the external facility surrounding your buildings or other areas, such
as the space just outside of a data center. Two key considerations are access control and monitoring:
 Access control. To maximize security, your facilities should restrict who can enter. This is often handled by
key cards and card readers on doors. Other common methods are a visitor center or reception area with
security guards and biometric scanners for entry (often required for data centers).
 Monitoring. As part of your perimeter security, you should have a solution to monitor for anomalies. For
example, if a door with a card reader is open for more than 60 seconds, it could indicate that it has been
propped open. If a person scans a data center door with a badge but that badge wasn’t used to enter any
other exterior door on that day, it could be a scenario to investigate — for example, maybe the card was
stolen by somebody who gained access to the building through the air vents. A monitoring system can alert
you to unusual scenarios and provide a historical look at your perimeter activities.
 Internal security controls. Internal security focuses on limiting access to storage or supply rooms, filing cabinets,
telephone closets, data centers and other sensitive areas. There are a couple of key methods to use:
 Escort requirements. When a visitor checks in at your visitor center, you can require an employee escort.
For example, maybe the visitor is required to always be with an employee and the guest badge does not
open doors via the door card readers. Escort requirements are especially important for visitors who will be
operating in sensitive areas (for example, an air conditioning company working on a problem in your data
center).
 Key and locks. Each employee should have the ability to secure company and personal belongings in their
work space to help prevent theft. If they have an office, they should lock it when they aren’t in the office. If
the employee has a desk or cubicle, they should have lockable cabinets or drawers for storing sensitive
information and other valuables.
7.16 Address personnel safety and security concerns
This section covers personnel safety — making sure employees can safely work and travel. While some of the techniques
are common sense, others are less obvious.
 Travel. The laws and policies in other countries can sometimes be drastically different than your own country.
Employees must be familiar with the differences prior to traveling. For example, something you see as benign
might be illegal and punishable by jail in another country. Other laws could make it difficult to do business in
another country or put your company at risk. When traveling to other countries, you should familiarize yourself
with the local laws to minimize danger to yourself and your company. Another key concern when traveling is
protecting company data. To protect company data during travel, encryption should be used for both data in transit
and data at rest. It is also a good practice (although impractical) to limit connectivity via wireless networks while
traveling. Take your computing devices with you, when possible, since devices left in a hotel are subject to
82
tampering. In some cases, such as when traveling to high-risk nations, consider having personnel leave their
computing devices at home. While this isn’t always feasible, it can drastically reduce the risk to personnel and
company devices or data. In some organizations, employees are given a special travel laptop that has been
scrubbed of sensitive data to use during a trip; the laptop is re-imaged upon return home.
 Security training and awareness. Employees should be trained about how to mitigate potential dangers in the
home office, while traveling or at home. For example, campus safety includes closing doors behind you, not walking
to your car alone after hours, and reporting suspicious persons. Travel safety includes not displaying your company
badge in public places and taking only authorized ride hailing services. Safety outside of work includes using a
secure home network and not inserting foreign media into devices. While the training and awareness campaigns
will differ, a key element is to have a campaign that addresses your organization’s particular dangers.
 Emergency management. Imagine a large earthquake strikes your primary office building. The power is out, and
workers have evacuated the buildings; many go home to check on their families. Other employees might be flying
to the office for meetings the next day. You need to be able to find out if all employees are safe and accounted for;
notify employees, partners, customers, and visitors; and initiate business continuity and/or disaster recovery
procedures. An effective emergency management system enables you to send out emergency alerts to employees
(many solutions rely on TXT or SMS messages to cellular phones), track their responses and locations, and initiate
emergency response measures, such as activating a secondary data center or a contingent workforce in an
alternate site.
 Duress. Duress refers forcing somebody to perform an act that they normally wouldn’t, due to a threat of harm,
such as a bank teller giving money to a bank robber who brandishes a weapon. Training personnel about duress
and implementing countermeasures can help. For example, at a retail store, the last twenty-dollar bill in the cash
register can be attached to a silent alarm mechanism; when an employee removes it for a robber, the silent alarm
alerts the authorities. Another example is a building alarm system that must be deactivated quickly once you enter
the building. If the owner of a business is met at opening time by a crook who demands that she deactivates the
alarm, instead of entering her regular disarm code, the owner can use a special code that deactivates the alarm
and notifies the authorities that it was disarmed under duress. In many cases, to protect personnel safety, it is a
good practice to have personnel fully comply with all reasonable demands, especially in situations where the loss
is a laptop computer or something similar.

Answers to Domain 7 Review Questions
1. Answer: A, B
Explanation: When a vulnerability exists but there is no patch to fix it, it is a zero-day vulnerability. When exploit
code exists to take advantage of a zero-day vulnerability, it is called a zero-day exploit. In this scenario, because the
computer was up to date on patches, we can conclude that there was a zero-day vulnerability and a zero-day
exploit.
2. Answer: B
Explanation: Quality of service provides priority service to a specified application or type of communication. In this
scenario, call quality is being impacted by other services on the network. By prioritizing the network communication
for the IP phones, you can maximize their performance (though that might impact something else).
3. Answer: D
Explanation: The first key requirement in this scenario is that the data center must not be impacted by the testing.
This eliminates the partial interruption and full interruption tests because those impact the data center. The other
key requirement is that IT teams must perform recovery steps. This requirement eliminates the tabletop testing
because tabletop testing involves walking through the plans, but not performing recovery operations.

Domain 8. Software Development Security
This domain focuses on managing the risk and security of software development. Security should be a focus of the
development lifecycle, and not an add-on or afterthought to the process. The development methodology and lifecycle can
have a big effect on how security is thought of and implemented in your organization. The methodology also ties into the
environment that the software is being developed for. Organizations should ensure that access to code repositories is
limited to protect their investment in software development. Access and protection should be audited on a regular basis.
You must also take into consideration the process of acquiring a development lifecycle, whether from another company, or
picking up a development project that is already in progress.
8.1 Understand and integrate security throughout the software
development lifecycle (SDLC)
This section discusses the various methods and considerations when developing an application. The lifecycle of
development does not typically have a final goal or destination. Instead, it is a continuous loop of efforts that must include
steps at different phases of a project.
 Development methodologies. There are many different development methodologies that organizations can use
as part of the development lifecycle. The following table lists the most common methodologies and the key related
concepts.
