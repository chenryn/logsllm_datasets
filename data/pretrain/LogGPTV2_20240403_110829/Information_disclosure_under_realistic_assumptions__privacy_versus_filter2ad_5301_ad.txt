## Figure 10: Traversing the Generalization Lattice
- **T1 (Marital, *, *)**: At this node, the original table contains one possible database state, which does not satisfy the entropy l-diversity.
- **T2 (Marital, *, *)**: The final disclosure table is generated based on this generalization node, as shown in Table 8. This delayed output schema protects the database state in Table 7.

## 5. Related Work
- Initial works [1, 3, 11, 16, 17] focused on conducting data censuses while protecting sensitive information in disclosed tables.
- Data swapping [10, 22, 27] and data suppression [18] were suggested to protect data but could not quantify the level of protection.
- Formal analysis of information disclosure in data exchange was provided by [9].
- The concept of k-anonymity was introduced by [24, 4] to prevent privacy breaches, even in the absence of identifying attributes.
- Achieving k-anonymity with optimal data utility was proven to be NP-hard [20].
- A similar measure called "blending in a crowd" was proposed by [26].
- A new generalization framework based on "personalized anonymity" was proposed by [28].
- Efficient algorithms for k-anonymity were proposed by [8, 23, 24, 19, 25, 15].
- The work [2] discussed the deficiencies of k-anonymity and proposed l-diversity as an alternative measure to ensure privacy in microdata disclosure.

## Algorithm 5: Disclosure Schema Generation
1. **Input**: B (set of all sensitive attributes)
2. **Output**: T (output disclosure schema for x)
3. **Variables**: D′, D∗, C (subsets of D)

### Steps:
1. Traverse the generalization lattice G using the original sequence T to find g1 ∈ G that satisfies l-anonymity.
2. Select a new sequence (g1, g2, ..., gn′) from g1 up to the top point of G.
3. Let T′ = (T1, T2, ..., Tn), where n = n′ + 1, and Tn represents no disclosure.
4. If Ti = Tn, return Tn.
5. For every j from n down to i + 1:
   - Traverse T′ to find the first Ti such that t(Ti, x) satisfies entropy l-diversity.
   - Return Ti.
6. If for every generalized group g in Tj, rs(g) does not satisfy Entropy l-diversity on Tj−1, return Tj.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Work
- This paper addresses the problem of maximizing data utility while ensuring safety, assuming the adversary may know the disclosure algorithm and sequence.
- Open research questions include extending "local optimality" to "global optimality," finding good measures of data utility, and exploring probabilistic disclosure algorithms.
- For microdata disclosure and l-diversity, less restrictive conditions than conservative p-safety and weak optimality need to be defined.
- Extending these techniques to more general settings beyond generalization sequences is an interesting area for future research.
