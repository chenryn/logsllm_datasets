### E. Deployment

A significant challenge in the deployment of many new technologies is the lack of incremental deployability. We hypothesize that the adoption of new technologies follows a similar pattern: initial adopters with a critical need for the technology start integrating it into their networks. As other entities observe the demand and recognize the necessity, the technology gains mainstream adoption. For a technology to be incrementally deployable, it must provide clear incentives for early adopters and offer incremental benefits to the early majority. However, many proposed schemes only become valuable if the late majority adopts them, providing no immediate benefit to early adopters.

**SVLAN (Secure Virtual Local Area Network) offers strong incremental deployability properties:**

1. **Partial Deployment Flexibility:**
   - SVLAN does not require a global deployment of new protocols; it can be partially deployed by endhosts who wish to establish a virtual network.
   - While coordination among ISPs is necessary, setting up a tunnel requires minimal coordination between the networks where the two endpoints are located.
   - To ensure secure transmission over untrusted intermediate ISPs, existing mechanisms such as VPNs can be used during the early deployment phase.
   - The partial deployment of source and destination networks ensures the same level of security, scalability, and flexibility, encouraging early adoption.

2. **Compatibility with Various Architectures:**
   - SVLAN is designed as a generic scheme that can be easily adapted to various architectures supporting segment routing.
   - Segment routing is already supported and deployed by major router vendors like Cisco, Huawei, and Juniper.
   - To maintain compatibility with the current Internet, we avoid substantial changes in our design. The AD (Authorization Domain) can be implemented as an add-on application on top of SDN controllers, and the SVTEP (Secure Virtual Tunnel End Point) and verifier can be realized using vSwitch.

3. **Market Incentives for Early Adopters:**
   - Cloud service providers can offer premium services by setting up secure virtual networks between data centers.
   - ISPs can achieve better network provisioning with the flexible and scalable network virtualization provided by SVLAN.

### IX. Conclusion

Network virtualization is a key component of future Internet innovation. To enhance scalability, flexibility, and security, we have introduced a framework that leverages destination-driven networking and packet-carrying forwarding state. SVLAN ensures receiver consent in communication, enabling fine-grained network virtualization. With stateless routing and expressive authorization policies, we achieve management scalability for dynamic network slicing. Our evaluation shows that SVLAN introduces a small one-time overhead (an average of 32.0 µs of additional latency) during the initial communication setup without significantly degrading data transmission performance. We envision SVLAN supporting diverse demands for network slicing, leading to secure communication and efficient administration.
