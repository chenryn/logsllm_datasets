E. Deployment
A major deployment difﬁculty for many new technologies
is the lack of incremental deployability. We conjecture that
the deployment of new technologies follows a similar trend:
First-movers with a critical need for a new technology start
to adopt the technology to their network. As the followers
observe customer demand and recognize the necessity of the
technology, the mainstream deploys it. In terms of incremental
deployability, a viable technology needs to have a clear incen-
tive for the early adopters and incremental beneﬁts for the early
majority. However, many proposed schemes are often valuable
only if the late majority adopts; there is no beneﬁt for the early
adopters.
SVLAN provides strong incremental deployability prop-
erties. First, it does not require a global deployment of new
protocols, but a partial deployment for endhosts who wish to
establish a virtual network. Although it requires coordination
amongst the ISPs, setting up a tunnel requires minimal coor-
dination only between networks in which the two endpoints
are located; to ensure a secure transmission over untrusted
intermediate ISPs between the endpoints, existing underlying
mechanisms (e.g., VPN) can be applied for the early deploy-
ment phase. The partial deployment of source and destination
network ensures the same level of security, scalability, and
ﬂexibility, encouraging early adoption.
Second, SVLAN does not necessarily rely on a speciﬁc
network architecture (e.g., SCION), since it is designed as
a generic scheme that can be easily adapted to various ar-
chitectures that support segment routing. Segment routing is
already supported and deployed by all major router vendors:
Cisco, Huawei, Juniper, etc. Furthermore, to keep compatibility
with the current Internet, we avoid any substantial changes in
our design of new entities; the AD can be easily implemented
on top of SDN controllers as an add-on application, and the
SVTEP and veriﬁer can be realized with vSwitch.
Third, SVLAN beneﬁts early adopters with clear market
incentives. Cloud service providers can offer premium services
to their customers by setting up secure virtual networks be-
tween data centers. ISPs can achieve a better provision for their
network with the ﬂexible and scalable network virtualization.

IX. CONCLUSION
Network virtualization is one of the key components of fu-
ture Internet innovation. To improve scalability, ﬂexibility and
security, we have introduced a framework that leverages the
concept of destination-driven networking and packet-carrying
forwarding state. SVLAN ensures receivers’ consent in com-
munication, enabling ﬁne-grained network virtualization. With
the stateless routing and expressive authorization policies, we
achieve management scalability for dynamic network slicing.
Our evaluation demonstrates that SVLAN introduces a small
one-time overhead (32.0 µs of additional latency on average)
to the initial communication setup without a signiﬁcant perfor-
mance degradation in data transmission. We envision SVLAN
to support diverse demands on network slicing, leading to
secure communication and efﬁcient administration.
