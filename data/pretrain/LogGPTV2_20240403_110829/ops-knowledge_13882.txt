User: I installed pythonxy (2.7.9), but when I try to run ipython from windows powershell, I get an error "failed to create process." What steps can I take to solve this problem. 
Thanks,
Assistant: You can also rename folders, for example C:\Python27_ , so that they are not found. This way you don't have to delete your libraries! Then you remove the underscore depending on the project you are working in. 
Make sure you have the relevant directories in the path, otherwise the version you do want won't be found at all.
Sorry of this sounds silly, but after painlessly failing to setup virtualenv in Windows, this solution comes in handy for having multiple Python installations.
