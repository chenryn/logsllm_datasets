Question: "In reviewing the DNS configurations of a web application, you notice that several subdomains are using different types of DNS records. From a security perspective, which DNS record type, if incorrectly configured, poses the highest risk of subdomain takeover with the most significant impact?"
 "A": "`A` record, as it directly maps the subdomain to an IP address and can be easily hijacked."
 "B": "`MX` record, since it deals with email servers and can compromise communication."
 "C": "`NS` record, because it allows control over the entire DNS zone if taken over."
 "D": "`TXT` record, as it can be exploited to verify domain ownership for SSL/TLS certificates."
Answer: C
