User: I need some help. Im trying to run Python IDLE on my computer but I get the following error: 

IDLE can't bind to a TCP/IP port, which is necessary to communicate with its Python execution server. This might be because no networking is installed on this computer. Run IDLE with the -n command line switch to start without a subprocess and refer Help/IDLE Help 'Running without a subprocess' for further details.   

My networking card just fried a couple days ago so I think this might be the problem, I dont know. I also tried refer to IDLE Help but I couldn't understand a thing.
Is there anyway I can get by this problem. I need this program operational for my programming class' a least until my new computer arrives.
Assistant: By using -n flag, you can use it for one time only. It means closing python idle, I'll have to redo -n flag process whenever  I want to open .
