User: I'm wondering if there's a more beginner-friendly environment to write Python than a terminal shell. Any suggestions?
Assistant: Don't expect what you'd get from a classical programming language IDE from something having to do with Python. It can't be done due to the dynamic nature of the language and the fact that in order to figure out details such as autocomplete, parameter info or members, an IDE would have, at some point, to run the code - it can't be done because of the possible side-effects.
I'm using Emacs and Sublime Text 2 myself.
