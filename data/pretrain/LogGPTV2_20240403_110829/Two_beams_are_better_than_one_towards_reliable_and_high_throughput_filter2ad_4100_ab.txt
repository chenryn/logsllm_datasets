standard for beamforming in mmWave communication systems.
We show that multi-beams are reliable while providing superior
throughput to single-beams in all scenarios. As a first, we develop
an efficient algorithm to estimate parameters and create multi-
beams in state-of-the-art phased arrays. Our algorithm is protocol
compatible and can be deployed over any beam-training scheme.
2.2 Beam Maintenance for Reliable mmWave
Beam maintenance is important to reduce the frequency and over-
head of repeated beam-training as shown in Fig. 2. For instance,
in the context of 5G-NR, a beam-training phase could take up to 5
ms to probe 64 beam directions with a default periodicity of 20 ms,
leading to a 25% overhead [33]. Even if a more efficient training
algorithm from [11, 34–37] is used, the overhead will make beam-
management solely based on beam-training intractable. The high
overhead of beam-training can be avoided by carefully utilizing
intrinsic features of mmWave protocols. They use known reference
signals interspersed with data communication to perform beam-
maintenance and refinement (See Fig. 2). These reference signals
provide channel measurements with an option to set any desired
beam. Due to the sparsity of these reference signals, they cannot be
used for a full-fledged beam-training, and only minor changes to
the beamforming vector can be made using few channel estimates.
A low-overhead beam-maintenance scheme is, therefore, a must
for reliable mmWave links.
While beam-maintenance for single beam links have been stud-
ied by some authors [31, 38, 39], there is no work that addresses
multi-beam links. Due to this gap, the utility of multi-beam for
communication is lessened despite its benefits. We are the first to
propose a low overhead beam-maintenance scheme using multi-
beam. Our approach periodically updates the per-beam angle, phase,
and amplitude with negligible overhead, requiring only three chan-
nel estimates for a 2-beam multi-beam and five estimates for a
3-beam multi-beam. The entire process is completed within 0.6 ms
for the latter, making multi-beam maintenance possible with low
overhead. With this, our work makes a compelling case for multi-
beam and addresses the end-to-end challenges in their creation and
maintenance.

3 Design of Multi-beam system
This section describes how mmReliable creates and leverages multi-
beam for reliable, high-throughput mmWave communication. We
first show how links can be made reliable to blockage by using
multiple beams at once. Then, we derive mathematically optimal
beamforming weights to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
at the receiver. We show that optimal beamforming is nothing but
constructive multi-beam for most typical mmWave channels.
We make an interesting observation that constructive multi-
beam is channel-dependent and depends on the number of paths,
their angles, relative phase, and attenuation. Naturally, to imple-
ment constructive multi-beam, we need to estimate these parame-
ters. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate these parameters
using the beam-management framework shown in Fig. 2. We lever-
age any standard beam-training procedure to calculate the angle of
each path [28, 29]. Then, we design a low-overhead method using
reference signals to estimate the per-path phase and attenuation.
Finally, we use these estimates to set up and maintain the optimal
constructive multi-beam despite the adversity of blockage and user
mobility.
3.1 Multi-beam links are more reliable
To compare various techniques on equal footing, we formally define
link reliability as the fraction of time when the link is available for
communication within a large observation interval. Link outage
(due to natural effects) or procedures like beam-training reduce
the reliability as they temporarily render the link unavailable for
communication. Therefore, we can express reliability as:
Reliability = 1 − Prob(Outage)
(1)
We empirically compute the probability of outage as the fraction
of duration where the SNR is below a minimum threshold. The
directional nature of single-beam mmWave links makes them sus-
ceptible to link outages since blockage & user mobility effects can
reduce SNR by up to 30 dB [40] (Fig. 13). Multi-beams prevent these
outages by avoiding a single point of failure.
Multi-beam links are reliable even under the impact of blockage
events. Consider a blockage probability 𝛽 (0 ≤ 𝛽 ≤ 1), which
represents the fraction of time the link is in outage during the
observation interval. For simplicity, we assume the beams in our
multi-beam are blocked independently. Thus, the probability that
𝑘 beams simultaneously experience an outage is 𝛽𝑘. By definition,
the reliability would be 1 − 𝛽 for the single-beam case and 1 −

vector space [42]. Therefore, the optimal weight vector is channel-
dependent. Intuitively, the weight vector cancels the phases in the
channel and creates an inner-product form that maximizes the
absolute value of their product. Additionally, the weights need to
be unitary to keep the power constant, i.e., ∥w∥ = 1. This way, we
get the optimal weights wopt as:
wopt = h∗/||h||,
𝛽𝑘, 𝑘 ≥ 2 for the multi-beam case. Multi-beam provides higher
reliability because it prevents the link from suffering an outage
due to blockage, unlike its single-beam counterparts [12, 40]. In
practice, blockages may be correlated, and scenarios could arise
where two or more paths are blocked simultaneously. While no
solution can prevent link outage if all paths are blocked (e.g., the
user inadvertently blocks all antennas with their body), multi-beam
links can be sustained as long as there is at least one unblocked
path to the receiver. Simultaneous blockage of multiple paths is
always less probable than blockage of a single path [12]; therefore,
multi-beam links are always more reliable than single-beam links.
3.2 Multi-beam Throughput Model
While multi-beams are intuitively resilient to blockage by virtue
of having multiple beams separated in angle, each beam’s power
is reduced since the total power is split amongst multiple beams.
One may wonder whether this leads to reduced throughput since it
could mean less power is incident on the receiver. But this is not the
case, and it can be shown that a multi-beam link with optimal con-
structive combining and power-control can, in fact, provide higher
throughput than a single-beam link. To prove this, we introduce
a model for a multi-antenna base station transmitting to the user
device using a mmWave link and derive the optimal beamforming
solution that maximizes the received SNR. We make two important
observations. First, we show that a single-beam system is optimal
only when the wireless channel consists of a single path from the
transmitter to the receiver. A single-beam system is sub-optimal for
a multipath channel, which is generally the case even for mmWave
links [41]. We then show that a multi-beam with two beams is
optimal for a two-path channel and maximizes the received SNR.
We conclude with a note on generalizing our formulation to an
arbitrary number of beams in multi-beam.
■ Primer on optimal beamforming: We derive an expression
for optimal beamforming weights at a multi-antenna base-station
(gNB phased array) communicating with a single antenna receiver
using mmWave (Multi-antenna receiver discussed in Section 4.4).
The gNB uses a uniform linear phased array with 𝑁 antenna el-
ements. Beamforming is implemented by applying a 𝑁 × 1 beam
weights vector w at each antenna using a combination of phase
shifters and attenuators (Fig. 3(a)). Our goal is to determine the
optimal w that maximizes the received SNR.
Let 𝑠 be the transmit signal from the gNB, the received signal 𝑦
is expressed as:
𝑦 = h𝑇 w𝑠 + 𝜂,
(2)
where h is 𝑁 × 1 channel from 𝑁 transmit antennas to one receive
antenna and 𝜂 is white Gaussian noise at the receiver. The capacity
or maximum throughput of a wireless link is evaluated in term of
SNR (the ratio of signal power to noise power) as:
SNR = ||h𝑇 w||2𝑃𝑠/𝑃𝜂,
(3)
where 𝑃𝑠 is the average transmit power (without transmit array
gain) and 𝑃𝜂 is the noise power2.
Our goal is to estimate beamforming weights w, that maximizes
the SNR. Using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, it follows that ||h𝑇 w||
is maximized when h∗ (complex conjugate of h) and w align in
2To derive the expression for SNR: 𝐸[𝑦𝑦𝐻 ] = 𝐸[(h𝐻 w𝑠 + 𝑛)(h𝐻 w𝑠 + 𝑛)𝐻 ]] =
∥h𝐻 w∥2𝐸[𝑠𝑠𝐻 ] + 𝐸[𝑛𝑛𝐻 ] and we denote 𝑃𝑠 = 𝐸[𝑠𝑠𝐻 ] and 𝑃𝜂 = 𝐸[𝑛𝑛𝐻 ].

𝑃𝜂
(4)
The optimal beamforming provides the highest SNR of ||h||2𝑃𝑠
. The
practical wireless channel—even mmWave channel—consists of
multiple paths (direct or reflected paths). Since the optimal beam-
forming vector depends on the channel h, it is affected by the nature
of these paths.
■ Single-beam is optimal for a single-path channel: Extend-
ing our discussion, it is natural to wonder how to provide a structure
to the general nature of optimal beamforming vectors (wopt). Con-
sider the simplest of wireless channels with a single path from the
transmitter to the receiver. It turns out that the single beam used by
conventional mmWave systems is optimal for such a channel. To
see this, we represent the single-path channel vector by hsingle and
derive the optimal weights. A single-path channel is entirely de-
fined by two parameters: the direction of departure 𝜙1 and complex
attenuation ℎ:
hsingle[𝑛] = ℎ𝑒−𝑗2𝜋 𝑑
(5)
where 𝑛 is the transmit-antenna index, 𝑑 is the antenna spacing,
and 𝜆 is the wavelength of carrier frequency (𝑑 = 𝜆
2 in our phased
array). Using (4) and (5), we obtain the optimal weights for this
channel as w𝜙1 = hsingle∗
∥hsingle ∥ which can be simplified to:
[1, 𝑒 𝑗2𝜋 𝑑
𝜆 sin(𝜙1), . . . , 𝑒 𝑗2𝜋 (𝑁−1) 𝑑
𝜆 sin(𝜙1)]𝑇 ,
𝜆 (𝑛−1) sin(𝜙1),
(6)
w𝜙1 =
1√
𝑁
which is the familiar single-beam weight vector [9, 12, 13, 43].
■ Constructive multi-beam is optimal for multipath chan-
nel: Since the optimal beam is channel dependent, let us observe
how it changes when we introduce a reflector into the channel as
shown in Fig. 3(b). We continue to use ℎ for the complex attenua-
tion of the first path. The second path’s attenuation is expressed as
ℎ𝛿𝑒 𝑗𝜎, where 𝛿 ∈ R+ and 𝜎 ∈ [0, 2𝜋] are respectively the relative
attenuation and phase shift of the second path with respect to the
first. Now, we can write the expression of two-path channel as:
hmulti[𝑛] = ℎ𝑒−𝑗2𝜋 𝑑
(7)
where 𝜙1 and 𝜙2 are the respective directions of departure of the
two paths. If we naively use the single-beam weights from (6) here,
it ignores the second path and severely attenuates power along 𝜙2
(Fig. 3(c)) resulting in an approximate SNR of:
𝜆 (𝑛−1) sin(𝜙1) + ℎ𝛿𝑒 𝑗𝜎𝑒−𝑗2𝜋 𝑑
𝜆 (𝑛−1) sin(𝜙2)
SNRsingle = ||(hsingle)𝑇 w𝜙1||2𝑃𝑠/𝑃𝜂 ≈ |ℎ|2𝑃𝑠/𝑃𝜂 .
SNRmulti = ∥ℎmulti∥2𝑃𝑠/𝑃𝜂 ≈ (1 + 𝛿2)|ℎ|2𝑃𝑠/𝑃𝜂 .
(8)
In contrast, the optimal weights for the multipath channel are
obtained from (4) as wmulti = hmulti∗/∥hmulti∥ which is visualized
in Fig. 3(d). From Eq. (3), the SNR of the optimal weights wmulti is:
(9)
In comparison to the naive single-beam approach, the optimal SNR
is higher by a factor of 1 + 𝛿2, which provides 2x gain (3dB higher
SNR) for two equally strong paths (𝛿 = 1) as we have seen in
Section 1. In general, wmulti is the optimal constructive multi-beam
weights that split the transmit signal along both the paths such that

that in mmWave, the number of multipath reflections is usually
sparse [18, 30]; therefore, there must be a simpler way to mea-
sure ℎ[𝑛]. Indeed, from (7), we see that the channel can be linearly
decomposed into its constituent single-beam directions. Said dif-
ferently: we can reconstruct ℎ[𝑛] using channel measurements on
individual multipath directions in the environment. Once we have
ℎ[𝑛], the optimal weights follow using (4).
Consider our example from the previous sub-section, where
two paths were present in the environment at angles 𝜙1, 𝜙2. If the
relative attenuation 𝛿 and the relative phase 𝜎 between each path
is measured, we can create the constructive multi-beam weights by
simple addition:
w(𝜙1, 𝜙2, 𝛿, 𝜎) =
(w𝜙1 + 𝛿𝑒−𝑗𝜎w𝜙2)
∥(w𝜙1 + 𝛿𝑒−𝑗𝜎w𝜙2)∥ ,

they maximally combine at the receiver. We discuss in Appendix A
how this result can be generalized to show that a k-multi-beam is
the optimal solution for a general k-path channel.
