Many wins at hacking contests/Run hacking contests/conferences
Talk at SYSCAN, CANSECWEST, TROOPERS, SECUINSIDE, etc
Hunting bugs is my favorite hobby
Intro
This is not a tech talk
Very easy talk, so, relax
This talk doesn’t say everything about the situation in Korea
But tried to put together as much as i can
A bit of security scene history in Korea
How we get inspired
How we make white-hat hackers
This is an extended version of AVTOKYO talk i gave at
When the scene gets activated
People say the scene has been started since the end of 90’
There were 2 big events at that time
Elite hackers at top universities (Postech and Kaist)
They were hacking each other and some went to jail
This was issued even on the media
Hackerslab (Wargame site)
Most underground hackers started from the site
First well-known infosec IRC in Korea
When the scene gets activated
From 2000, there have been underground teams
Hackerschool
BEISTLAB
Wowhacker
Null@root
No illegal stuff, they teach and train next generation
Many of them are now high-ups and still working in this ﬁeld
They really do for the community
When the scene gets activated
Industry around 2000
There were many security products
Mostly, IDS, Firewall and Secure OS
But penetration testing really made infosec guys
As it’s “hack”
Pen-testing business was really messed up at that time
Companies stole others’ contracts by hacking
Why the scene is motivated?
(What happened?)
Motivations to
Government
Industry
The community
Why the scene is motivated?
(What happened?)
Government
We have a very special situation
South Korea vs North Korea
The government started to ﬁnd good hackers
They (secretly) supported the community
But most helpful move by them was pushing industry to 
spend money for information security
Why the scene is motivated?
(What happened?)
Industry
We have to say “money” can do a lot of things
Some big (like ﬁnancial) companies realized that cyber 
attack is real
Auction, SK Communications, HyunDae Card and +++
The strict law made them to spend money for security
(Will cover about this later)
Why the scene is motivated?
(What happened?)
Industry
So, they spent a ton of money and hired many infosec guys
Having regular penetration testing is kind of mandatory 
Which means security ﬁrms are not going to starve
This says everything: we have over 200 security companies 
in this small country
Why the scene is motivated?
(What happened?)
The community
Fortunately, we’ve got hacking competitions from 1999
Even though there was (still) a language barrier, Korean 
hackers were really passionated on CTF
Defcon CTF was a ﬁre
Before 2006, Defcon CTF was a dream for Korean hackers
Anyway, they were excited, and made it to ﬁnals
Why the scene is motivated?
(What happened?)
The community
And the community was inspired by researches from world 
class hackers
RTL by Solar designer, IIS 0days by Chinese hackers and a 
lot of cool stuff
They tried to make something themselves 
What they are doing
We can categorize as
Community
Industry
Academy
Government
Community
We have over 10 hacking contests/conferences per year
Majors: Secuinside, Codegate, ISEC, KISA
Most of them are involved with the community
Companies pay for run and the community helps
Community
http://hackerschool.org
This site really does a lot of cool things for the community
Cartoon based lecture
For example) http://bit.ly/SP0enX
Hacking camp for elementary students
Hacking contest for women
Article) http://t.co/uZMWf2rV
Community
KOSEC
Cool local meet-up (like NYSEC in NYC)
Hang out and chill
Sometimes talks included
Every 1 or 2 month
40~50 people to come (100 was maximum)
Charlie Miller was here!
Community
Try hard to do for next generation
The underground teams ﬁnd young guys
And they train them about security
Also, they emphasize ethics
They think they have to give back to the community
Example) beistlab got $10,000 and spent back 
for making a hacking contest (JFF)
Industry
As we mentioned, we have over 200 security ﬁrms
They support conferences and hackers’ activity
Example) LAW&TEK supports HARU for hackerspace
One good thing is that young guys can work for security 
companies instead of going to army
Industry
They try to make something good for the community with 
hackers
Example) SECUSIDE by KOSCOM and HARU
http://secuinside.com
KOSCOM is a ﬁnancial company
They spend big money for running the conference/CTF
And the community, called HARU, actually runs 
Win Win (Popularity for KOSCOM and Fun for HARU)
Industry
POC Conference (http://www.powerofcommunity.net/)
HNS company
It was started by hackers
It seems it wants to be like a Korea Defcon
CODEGATE Conference
Softforum company
It is fancy and a big conference
High up guys at the government involved
Academy
As information security is getting more and more important, 
universities start to have infosec related majors
Korea university
Seoul women university
Sejong university
Soonchunhyang university
And more than 10 schools
Academy
Korea university is a somewhat special case
They have MOU with Cyber command (Sound scary?)
Only top 1% SAT guys go there
All students of cyber warfare major at Korea university get 
full scholarship
And they go to Army after graduating (For 5 years)
Which means they’ll be specialized at the ﬁeld
Their curriculum and students are secret
Academy
Like in Taiwan, if students want to get into good school, they 
have to get good SAT score
But from around middle of 2000’, we have seen that they can 
get in if they’re really good at Hacking
Schools give students advantages if they have awards from 
hacking contests
This is a big ﬁre to encourage students (even their parents!) to 
learn about computer security
Academy
At school, over 30 information security clubs in Korea
They are extremely activated
Making articles and joining/running infosec events
Some clubs are famous at the world class CTFs
GoN (KAIST), PLUS (Postech)
Government
All governments are eager to hire people
Lack of skilled hackers
Usually, it is not easy to get into governments
Like NIS, Cyber command for examples
Good GPA, Good schools required
But they are making exceptions for skilled hackers
Government
KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency)
http://kisa.or.kr
They do CERT (incident response or something like that)
They encourage and support university school students 
They made KUCIS (Korea University Clubs of Information 
Security) and support university clubs
Awards and money
Government
KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency)
KISA also gives motivations to hackers
They run a bug bounty (since september 2012)
I’m one of judges
Every quarter
Over 100 submits to this program
Even middle/high school students submit bugs
Government
http://www.krcert.or.kr/kor/consult/consult_04.jsp
Vulnerability report program
Government
KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency)
The maximum prize is about $5,000 per person
Obviously not enough, but at least a good move
And focused on korean software which no one would 
buy that means reasonable
When they get reports from hackers and let vendors know
Government
KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency)
When hackers report to this program
The credit goes to to them
They can use their bugs as reference
Only korean citizen can participate
But if you team up with korean, yes you can
Examination standard
Impact, difﬁculty, report quality
Government
Cyber command
We have Cyber command like in US
They’re responsible
Plan cyber wars
Attack and defense in the cyber ﬁeld
Develop cyber security technique 
Bring up cyber warriors 
etc
Government
Cyber command
In korea, we go to army for 2 years
Spending 2 years at army is not easy for young guys
Cyber command makes a way for them that they can be 
focused on information security or do cyber security
That is huge welcome for people who do not want to be 
“real soldiers”
Government
Cyber command
Also, they show the community a good move
They try to make good relationship with hackers
Like Jeff Moss named to advisory council for DHS
They get hackers to their advisory council
Thanks! I’m one of them.
Government
NCSC (National Cyber Security Center)
It’s like Korea NSA (http://ncsc.go.kr)
They run a bug bounty as well
But the prize is small
I’ve not seen anyone got over $2,000 from the program
However, still interesting as the government is doing that
Probably it’s a ﬁrst case around the world
Government
BoB (Best of the best)
http://www.kitribob.kr/
By ministry of Knowledge Economy and KITRI
Training program for young guys to be security professional
Very well organized program
I’m one of mentors in BoB
Government
BoB (Best of the best)
BoB started from since 2012
Last year, we made huge success
Around 300 students applied to be 60
Students made good result
Got media attention
Even CNN
Government
BoB (Best of the best)
As the success, the government decided to support more 
for this program
More $$$ and +++
 More bigger in 2013
About 500 students applied to be 120
Government
BoB (Best of the best)
8 month course
Survival program
At the beginning: 60 students -> 120 
After 6 month: 30 students
Only 10 students selected at the end
Government
BoB (Best of the best)
First 6 months
Learning about information security from professionals
Crypto, network, OS, hacking, ethics and ++
Projects with mentors
And 2 months
Advanced researches with mentors
World popular hackers come to korea to teach students
In 2012, Stefan Esser
Government
BoB (Best of the best)
Students get paid monthly (For only learning!)
And free laptops
The 10 students will get around $17,000 each
Also supported overseas study
Collaboration
Junior CTF
It’s a hacking competition dedicated only for middle and 
high school students
It’s a joint event by the government (ETRI), industry 
(Softforum), and the community (GrayHash)
I and Mongii make challenges and run this competition
Collaboration
Junior CTF
This is a nice chance for young students
As if they won, the prize can be good reference when they 
get into colleges
We’re planning to make this one more bigger and bigger
Things to mention
Cyber Law
The cyber law in Korea is extremely strict
If companies got hacked and it turned out that it was 
companies’ fault, they have to pay customers for damage
Sounds a bit weird but true (victims pay?)
Especially, personal information privacy law is strict too
Things to mention
Cyber law
Cyber law is cruel for companies
But we have to admit that because of the law, the 
information security ﬁeld is growing very quickly
As they have to spend money
Things to mention
Black-market
Of course, we have script kiddies
But, we don’t have any black-market or serious cyber 
criminal crew
Don’t know why, but, I think the strict law is one of reasons
Even reversing was illegal a few years ago
Dark side
Even though, information security ﬁeld is very activated, this 
industry doesn’t give dream to everyone
There are roughly 5 positions for engineers
Monitoring
Penetration testing
Reversing or analyzing malware
Hunting bugs
Consulting
Dark side
Only skilled reverser and bug hunters get paid good
Other positions, they work unbelievably hard
9 to 10 or longer
But, payment is no good
High-up guys still don’t understand security
It’s hard to persuade them to know it
Dark side
Some people say it’s because there are too many infosec guys
Also, monitoring job is easy and penetration testing (depends 
on) is not hard
So, people just dive into the positions
Where hackers want to work?
I gave questions to over my 50 infosec friends
Working outside of korea (but language barrier)
Financial companies
Governments (like NIS or Cyber command)
Big companies (like SamSung)
Known security ﬁrms (like Ahnlab)
Small security ﬁrms
Off topic
I did a quick survey
I gave some questions to young hackers in Korea
What is your main interests in information security?
If you like offensive research, what do you dig into?
Is it easy to ﬁnd people or community to get help?
What do you want support from the government?
Off topic
What is your main interests in information security?
Most people say
Finding vulnerabilities
Hardware hacking
Exploiting technique
Reverse engineering
Off topic
If you like offensive research, what do you dig into?
Most people say
Hunting bugs in popular software
Web browsers, telecommunication protocols, web 
servers, ftp servers, etc
Off topic
Is it easy to ﬁnd people or community to get help?
Most people say ‘yes’
Even though there is a language barrier, there is a ton of 
translated documentations
Local hackers also make good materials
Remember, hackerschool.org even has manga-lectures
And local meet-up like KOSEC is good to get help
Off topic
What do you want support from the government?
They say the government support is getting better
But they wish there was a program like CFT (Cyber Fast 
Track by DARPA)
They want to get supported from their own research
Conclusion
Korea is probably most activated infosec country in East Asia
But the language barrier is a huge problem
How many korean hackers do you know?
We need more skilled people and do some real world 
researches (Not just CTFs!)
However, It’s going to be much better as the community, 
industry, academy and government are helping and 
collaborating each other
Contact me if you have questions!
Thanks!
