### Introduction
This presentation is not a technical talk. It aims to provide an overview of the cybersecurity landscape in South Korea, focusing on the history, motivations, and initiatives that have fostered the growth of white-hat hackers. This extended version builds upon my previous talk at AVTOKYO.

### Historical Context
#### Early Beginnings
- **Late 1990s**: The scene began with elite hackers at top universities like POSTECH and KAIST, engaging in mutual hacking, some of which led to legal consequences.
- **Hackerslab**: A wargame site that served as a starting point for many underground hackers and was the first well-known infosec IRC in Korea.

#### Growth in the 2000s
- **Underground Teams**: Groups like Hackerschool, BEISTLAB, Wowhacker, and Null@root emerged, focusing on teaching and training the next generation of ethical hackers.
- **Penetration Testing**: This practice became popular and helped legitimize the infosec field, despite initial chaos in the industry.

### Motivations
#### Government
- **Geopolitical Context**: The ongoing tension between South Korea and North Korea has driven the government to seek and support skilled hackers.
- **Support Initiatives**: The government secretly supported the community and mandated that industries invest in information security.

#### Industry
- **Financial Incentives**: Major breaches at companies like Auction, SK Communications, and HyunDae Card highlighted the need for robust security measures.
- **Legal Requirements**: Strict laws required companies to spend more on security, leading to a surge in demand for infosec professionals.
- **Security Firms**: Over 200 security firms operate in South Korea, ensuring a steady flow of opportunities for infosec professionals.

#### Community
- **Hacking Competitions**: Regular contests like Defcon CTF and Codegate have inspired and engaged the community since 1999.
- **Research and Development**: Influential research by world-class hackers, such as Solar Designer and Chinese hackers, motivated local enthusiasts to contribute their own work.

### Current Initiatives
#### Community
- **Events and Conferences**: Over 10 annual hacking contests and conferences, including Secuinside, Codegate, and ISEC, are supported by both companies and the community.
- **Educational Resources**: Platforms like Hackerschool.org offer cartoon-based lectures and organize hacking camps for students.
- **Local Meet-ups**: KOSEC, a local meet-up group, provides a space for networking and knowledge sharing.

#### Industry
- **Corporate Support**: Companies like KOSCOM and Softforum sponsor and run large-scale conferences and CTFs, fostering a collaborative environment.
- **Hackerspaces**: Organizations like HARU and LAW&TEK support hackerspaces and other community-driven initiatives.

#### Academia
- **University Programs**: Several universities, including Korea University, Seoul Women's University, and Sejong University, now offer specialized infosec majors.
- **Scholarships and Training**: Top students in cyber warfare programs receive full scholarships and go on to serve in the military, specializing in the field.
- **Admissions Flexibility**: Universities have started to admit students with strong hacking skills, even if their SAT scores are not top-tier.

#### Government
- **Cyber Command**: Responsible for planning and executing cyber warfare, the Cyber Command also supports the community by bringing hackers into advisory roles.
- **KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency)**: Runs a bug bounty program, supports university clubs, and encourages young talent through initiatives like BoB (Best of the Best).
- **BoB (Best of the Best)**: An 8-month training program for aspiring security professionals, offering financial incentives and mentorship from world-renowned experts.

### Challenges and Opportunities
#### Legal Framework
- **Strict Cyber Laws**: While these laws have spurred the growth of the infosec field, they also place significant pressure on companies to maintain high security standards.
- **Privacy and Data Protection**: Personal information privacy laws are particularly stringent, adding to the complexity of the security landscape.

#### Dark Side
- **Job Market**: Despite the growing field, certain positions like monitoring and penetration testing are often underpaid and require long hours.
- **Skill Gap**: There is a need for more skilled professionals, especially in areas like reverse engineering and vulnerability hunting.

#### Future Prospects
- **Collaboration**: The continued collaboration between the community, industry, academia, and government will drive further advancements.
- **International Engagement**: Addressing the language barrier and increasing international participation can help South Korea become a global leader in cybersecurity.

### Conclusion
South Korea is one of the most active countries in the East Asian infosec scene. While there are challenges, the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders are driving significant progress. For more information or questions, feel free to contact me at [PI:EMAIL].
