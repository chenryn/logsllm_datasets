User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why would someone open a Netflix account using my Gmail address? This is something that happened to me a few months ago.  I don't know if it is a hack attempt, although I can't think of any way that there could be any danger or any personal information gained.

I don't have a Netflix account and never have done.  I have a Gmail address which I have never used for public communication.  Suddenly I started getting email to this Gmail address from Netflix - not a "Welcome to Netflix" email or one requesting address verification, but what looked like a monthly promo for an existing account.  This was addressed to someone with a different real name, with that name not similar in any way to the Gmail name.

After a few of these messages I decided to investigate by going to Netflix and trying to log in with that email address.  Using the "forgotten password" option I was able to get a password reset email, change the password and log in.  The account appeared to be from Brazil, with some watch history but no other personal details stored and no payment information.

Soon the emails from Netflix started to ask me to update payment information.  I didn't, of course, and then they changed to "your account will be suspended" and then "your account has been suspended".  The "come back to Netflix" emails are still coming in occasionally.

I don't see how this could possibly be a phishing attempt - I carefully checked that I was on the real Netflix site, used a throwaway password not used on any other sites, and did not enter any of my personal information.  I also checked the headers of the emails carefully and they were sent by Netflix.  So is this just a mistake on somebody's part, mistyping an email address (although it's surprising that Netflix accepted it with no verification), or something more sinister?

Assistant: I think it's likely that someone is trying to trick you into paying for Netflix for them.  From: https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user/:


  More generally, the phishing scam here is:
  
  
  Hammer the Netflix signup form until you find a gmail.com address which is “already registered”. Let’s say you find the victim jameshfisher.
  Create a Netflix account with address james.hfisher.
  Sign up for free trial with a throwaway card number.
  After Netflix applies the “active card check”, cancel the card.
  Wait for Netflix to bill the cancelled card. Then Netflix emails james.hfisher asking for a valid card.
  Hope Jim reads the email to james.hfisher, assumes it’s for his Netflix account backed by jameshfisher, then enters his card **** 1234.
  Change the email for the Netflix account to eve@gmail.com, kicking Jim’s access to this account.
  Use Netflix free forever with Jim’s card **** 1234!
  


(Note that the above steps don't include any "password reset" step for Jim to access the account; that's because the email from Netflix includes authenticated links that won't ask for it.  The attacker wants the victim to click on the email links instead of visiting Netflix manually, this is what enables "Eve" to log back in to the account in step 7.  Or, since Netflix emails authenticated links, possibly "Eve" already has one.)

The above situation is partially caused by Netflix (understandably) not recognizing Gmail's "dots don't matter" feature where email sent to foo.bar@example.com and to foobar@example.com end up in the same account.  That doesn't really matter in your case (given that if this is how you're trying to be scammed, step 1 was skipped entirely), however.

A bigger problem is that Netflix apparently still allows people to register email addresses to accounts without verification.
