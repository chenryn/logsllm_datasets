I am running a simple server, but I am encountering some errors. Despite updating to Deno v1.2.1, the issue persists. Could you please help me resolve this?

**Error Details:**

```
error: TS2345 [ERROR]: Argument of type 'string | URL' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
  Type 'URL' is not assignable to type 'string'.
  return new URL(url).pathname
