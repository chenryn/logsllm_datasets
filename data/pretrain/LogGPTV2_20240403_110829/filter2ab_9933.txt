**ATT&CK ID:** T1052  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Physical Medium

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data using a physical medium, such as a removable drive. In scenarios where the target network is air-gapped, exfiltration can occur through a physical medium or device introduced by a user. Common examples of such media include external hard drives, USB drives, cellular phones, MP3 players, and other removable storage or processing devices. These physical mediums or devices can serve as the final exfiltration point or be used to transfer data between otherwise isolated systems.
