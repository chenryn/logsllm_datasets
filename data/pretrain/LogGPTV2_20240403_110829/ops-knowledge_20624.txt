User: I have python script and want to stop work or kill proccess after 60 second of execution .
not just stop work , kill or die proccess.
Don't find a good reference for this .
P.S: Kill python script itself (like a timer with first line of script to kill script after a time)
P.S2: I'm on windows and want compile it to .exe
P.S3: Python is on version 2.7
Assistant: If you are using Linux, you can try this:
(cmdpid=$BASHPID; (sleep 60; kill $cmdpid) & exec YOUR_COMMAND)
for example, if you want to execute a program named script.py:
(cmdpid=$BASHPID; (sleep 60; kill $cmdpid) & exec python script.py)
