### Title: Behind the Scenes of iOS and Mac Security

With over 1.4 billion active devices, Apple is committed to advancing user security through comprehensive protections that span every layer, from silicon to software. In this presentation, we will delve into three key areas of iOS and Mac security in unprecedented technical detail, including several key technologies introduced in iOS 13 and on the Mac.

#### Code Integrity Enforcement

Code integrity enforcement has long been a critical component of the iOS security architecture. Starting with the iPhone 7, Apple began to enhance this security mechanism by integrating new features directly into its custom silicon. We will explore the evolution of code and memory integrity technologies in both the iOS kernel and userland, leading up to the introduction of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the Apple A12 Bionic and S4 chips. PAC prevents the modification of function pointers, return addresses, and certain data, thereby mitigating traditional exploitation of memory corruption bugs. We will provide a detailed look at how PAC is implemented, including the enhancements made in iOS 13. Additionally, we will discuss previously undisclosed virtual machine (VM) permission and page protection technologies that are integral to our overall iOS code integrity architecture.

#### Secure Boot with the T2 Security Chip

The T2 Security Chip introduced robust secure boot capabilities to the Mac. Ensuring the security of the boot process required defenses against sophisticated direct memory access (DMA) attacks at every stage, even in the presence of arbitrary Option ROM firmware. We will walk through the boot sequence of a Mac equipped with the T2 Security Chip, explaining the key attacks and defenses at each step. This includes two industry-first firmware security technologies that have not been publicly discussed before.

#### Find My Feature

The Find My feature in iOS 13 and macOS Catalina allows users to locate their lost Macs with the help of other nearby Apple devices, while rigorously protecting the privacy of all participants. We will discuss our efficient elliptic curve key diversification system, which generates short, non-linkable public keys from a userâ€™s keypair. This system enables users to find their offline devices without divulging sensitive information to Apple.

By providing these deep dives into key security technologies, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of the advanced security measures that Apple implements to protect its users.
