User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to check sshd log? I have Ubuntu 9.10 installed with sshd and I can successfully connect to it using login and password. I have configured an RSA key login and now have "Server refused our key" as expected. Ok, now I want to check sshd log in order to figure out a problem. I have examined /etc/ssh/sshd_config and it have

SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel INFO


Ok. I'm looking at /var/log/auth.log and... it's empty O_O. Changing Loglevel to VERBOSE helps nothing - auth.log is still empty. Any hints how I can check sshd log?

SSH auth failures are logged here /var/log/auth.log

The following should give you only ssh related log lines 

grep 'sshd' /var/log/auth.log

To be on the safe side, get the last few hundred lines and then search (because if the log file is too large, grep on the whole file would consume more system resources, not to mention will take longer to run)

View sshd entries in the last 500 lines of the log:

tail -n 500 /var/log/auth.log | grep 'sshd'

or to follow the log output as you test:

tail -f -n 500 /var/log/auth.log | grep 'sshd'
