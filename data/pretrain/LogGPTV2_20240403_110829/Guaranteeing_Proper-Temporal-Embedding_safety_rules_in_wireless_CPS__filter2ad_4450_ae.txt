1. Each trial lasts 30 minutes, and is under constant WiFi interference.
2. For each trial, the expectation E(Ton) ≡ 30(sec).

the system from violating the PTE safety rules.
interfaces are implemented via ZigBee TMote-Sky motes [23].
In addition, there is an IEEE 802.11g WiFi interference source
2 meters away from the supervisor. The Interference source
broadcasts interfering WiFi packets at a data rate of 3Mbps
at a radio band overlapping with that of the ZigBee TMote-
Sky motes’. Because the interference broadcast is independent
from the laser tracheotomy wireless CPS communications, any
packets/events between the supervisor, ventilator, and laser-
scalpel emulation computers can be lost.
Trials and Results:
We ran two emulation trials, each of 30 minutes duration.
During the emulation, the PTE safety rules are:
1.
2.
Neither ventilator pause nor laser emission can last for
more than 1 minute (we assume that holding breath
for 6 1 minute is always safe);
Ventilator pause duration must always properly-
temporally-embedding laser emission duration, with
entering/exiting safeguard interval of T min
risky:1→2 =
3(s) and T min
safe:2→1 = 1.5(s).
violation of either of the PTE safety rules is a failure.
As mentioned before,
in the two emulation trials,
the
emulated surgeon request to emit/cancel-emit laser according
to timer Ton and Toﬀ , both are random numbers following
exponential distribution. The expectation of Ton is 30(s). The
expectations of Toﬀ are 18(s) and 6(s) respectively in the two
emulation trials.
Because of the use of our proposed lease based design
pattern, and the conﬁguration of parameters satisfying Theo-
rem 2, although packets/events between ventilator, supervisor,
and laser-scalpel emulator can be arbitrarily lost, the PTE
safety rules are never violated. This is shown in Table I, the
two rows corresponding to “with Lease” both have 0 failures.
For comparison, we also ran two additional emulation trials
with the same conﬁgurations but without using the leasing
mechanism. Speciﬁcally, the ventilator does not set up a lease
timer when it is pausing, neither does the laser-scalpel set up
a lease timer when it is emitting laser. When the surgeon’s
cancel laser emission event is lost or the supervisor’s abort
event is lost, no one can terminate the ventilator’s pause or
the laser’s emission. Thus, as shown in Table I, the two rows
corresponding to “without Lease” both result in many failures.
The intuitive explanations to the above empirical evidences
are as follows. Because of leasing, the ventilator’s stay in

the pause state (i.e. risky-locations) expires on lease time-
out; hence it will automatically return to “Fall-Back” to
continue ventilating the patient, even when it is cut-off from
communications. Same applies to the laser-scalpel’s stay in
the emission state (i.e. risky-locations). Conditions c1 ∼ c7
of Theorem 2 further guarantees that the automatic returns
to “Fall-Back” of ventilator and laser-scalpel both conform to
proper-temporal-embedding even under arbitrary packet/event
losses.
We further consider a number of typical scenarios to get
better intuitions on why the proposed leasing approach and
parameter conﬁguration constraints are critical in guaranteeing
PTE safety rules.
One scenario is that after the ventilator is paused and the
laser-scalpel is emitting, the surgeon may forget to cancel laser
emission until too late (e.g. Tof f is set to 1 hour). In this case,
only the abort request from the supervisor can stop laser emis-
sion and resume ventilator before it is too late. However, this
requires a sequence of correct send/receive of events through
wireless: evtξ0T oξ2Abort, followed by evtξ2T oξ0Exit, and
followed by evtξ0T oξ1Abort. Losing any one of these events
at the receiver end will cause PTE safety rules violation. For
example, losing evtξ2T oξ0Exit, the supervisor may think the
laser-scalpel is stuck and cannot stop laser emission, hence
ventilator shall keep pausing.
With leasing, the laser emission terminates within the lease
T max
run,2 = 20s with or without surgeon’s request to cancel;
and the ventilator resumes within the lease T max
run,1 = 35s with
or without supervisor’s requests. Hence PTE safety rules are
protected.
Similar analysis applies to the scenario that the surgeon
remembers to cancel laser emission, but his/her cancelling re-
quest (i.e. evtξ2T oξ0Cancel) is not received at the supervisor.
Without lease, the ventilator may keep pausing till for too long;
with lease, the ventilator will keep pausing for T max
run,1 = 35s
at the most, hence cannot suffocate the patient.

enter,1), then because T min
A third scenario involves the parameter conﬁguration con-
straints. Suppose we set T max
enter,1 = 0s (or any other
value so that T max

> 0, Condition c5 of Theorem 1 is violated. Under such
design, immediately after the ventilator is paused, the laser-
scalpel can emit
laser, violating the PTE requirement of
T min
risky:1→2 = 3s: that the laser-scalpel must wait for another
3s after the ventilator pauses, and then can it emit laser.
More failure scenarios are possible. However, if we follow
the proposed lease based design approach and meet parameter
conﬁguration constraints listed in Theorem 1, Theorem 1 and
2 guarantees PTE safety rules.
Boix et al. [11] applied leases to mobile ad hoc networks;
and Adya et al. [12] applied lease to cloud computing. As
pointed out in Section IV-A, all these distributed computer
systems are fundamentally different from CPS due to following
reasons: 1) check-point and roll-back, which are intensively
used in lease protocols for distributed computer systems are
often impossible for CPS (e.g. we cannot revive a killed
patient); 2) PTE temporal ordering, particularly the minimum
safeguard interval requirements are usually not present for
distributed computer systems (which usually focus on causal
precedences); 3) in CPS, uncontrollable physical world param-
eters can often interfere with the computer software dynamics.
Formal methods and model checking techniques have been
widely used in various applications. Majzik et al. [25] apply the
formal methods in the quantitative evaluation of the Driver Ma-
chine Interface (DMI). Ramasamy et al. [26] employ the SPIN
model checker to validate the correctness of a formal model of
the intrusion-tolerant Group Membership Protocol(GMP). Do-
natelli et al. [27] solve the problem of Continuous Stochastic
Logic (CSL) model checking in the context of Generalized
Stochastic Petri Nets. Buchholz et al. [28] present a new
framework for model checking techniques that can be applied
to the general class of weighted automata. Haverkort [29]
gives a short paper summarizing the formal modelling of timed
system in practice.
In the design pattern formalization, formal methods have
also been applied [30]–[33]. For the hybrid modelling, it is
mostly used for veriﬁcation [3], [13]–[16]. Recently, Tichakorn
[34] proposed a subclass of hybrid automata for a class of
hybrid control systems in which certain control actions occur
roughly periodically and applied it to verify the safety of an
autonomous vehicle. However, the intent there is veriﬁcation,
than a design methodology as in our work.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a lease based design pattern
to guarantee PTE safety rules in wireless CPS, as part of
the effort to address challenges arising from poor reliability
of wireless communication on CPS’ mission/life criticality.
We derived a set of closed-form constraints, and proved that
as long as system parameters are conﬁgured to satisfy these
constraints, PTE safety rules are guaranteed under arbitrary
wireless communication faults. Furthermore, we developed
hybrid modeling approaches to describe the design patterns,
and developed a formal methodology to elaborate the design
pattern into speciﬁc designs that provide PTE safety guar-
antees. Our case study on laser tracheotomy wireless CPS
validates the proposed design methodology.
VI. RELATED WORK
Lease protocol was originally proposed by Gray et al. [7]
and is used to provide efﬁcient consistent access to cached data
in distributed computer systems. With leases, the inconsisten-
cies caused by communication faults can be recovered. In the
past decades, various lease based distributed computer systems
have been implemented to achieve system consistency [8]–
[10]. Recently, Chen et al. [24] proposed a dynamic lease
technique to keep track of the local DNS name servers.
