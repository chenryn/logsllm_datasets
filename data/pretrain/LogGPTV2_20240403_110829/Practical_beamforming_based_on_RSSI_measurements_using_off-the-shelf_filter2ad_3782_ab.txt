tivations can be used to identify the relative channel phase between
the channel gains by rewriting Equation 2 as
θij = cos−1 Pij − Pi − Pj

By repeating this idea for pairs of antenna elements, the rela-
tive phases can be obtained. Since all the channel phases must be
measured with respect to the same reference for estimates to be
meaningful, we designate element 1 as the reference element. The
channel gain magnitudes can be obtained directly from the power
measurements by activating each antenna element individually as
|hi| =
Pi. When used along with the relative phases, the beam-

client to the AP is limited to 44 bytes (i.e 22∗ 16 bits) which is less
than a normal 802.11 packet size. When an averaging value S = 5
is used the feedback packet size required is 44 ∗ 5 = 220 bytes,
which is within the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of Wiﬁ
links. However, our current hardware (Phocus Array v2.1 [18])
does not allow fast changing of patterns within a packet. Hence,
for the implementation, each excitation takes one packet duration.
But with a more sophisticated implementation, we believe that the
excitation process can be accomplished much faster.
The effect of the above overhead depends on the frequency of
adaptation, which depends on the frequency of channel variation.
Additionally, as explained in [16], for static clients a beam pattern
can be estimated and retained for several tens of seconds (thou-
sands of packets) without incurring appreciable degradation in per-
formance. When considering mobile clients, the frequency of adap-
tation is higher. Nevertheless, pedestrian mobility is typically low

in SNR and 7.1X in throughput for the locations proﬁled. Similarly,
when compared to directional antennas, the average gain is 3 dB in
SNR and 1.64x in throughput with a best case gain in SNR of up to
4 dB. Hence, we conﬁrm that the proposed solution that uses RSSI
feedback can be used to achieve signiﬁcant beamforming gains.
Note that the average SNR gains reported in this work are lower
than that achieved with ideal adaptive beamforming performed us-
ing symbol level channel estimates (which is around 6.5 dB) [16].
We identify the following reasons for this gain reduction: (1) the
approximation error introduced by using RSSI values which are
quantized to integral values in dB instead of absolute signal power,
and (2) the experiments in [16] do not use an Automatic Gain con-
trol(AGC) circuitry which is implemented in commercial systems;
the AGC circuitry tends to decrease the beamforming gains.
In
spite of this, we note that the proposed solution gives signiﬁcant
beamforming beneﬁts while reducing the complexity of beamform-
ing. We leave the ﬁne-tuning of the algorithm to future work.
3.2 Link Stability beneﬁts
We focus on the beneﬁt that beamforming brings in overcom-
ing the losses that occur due to multipath fading. Figure 3 plots
the error performance on the y-axis for a ﬁfteen second snapshot
of a UDP trafﬁc experiment in a single location (Location 1). The
WiFi card increments a counter whenever a packet header is suc-
cessfully decoded but the CRC for the MAC layer payload failed.
The athstats utility prints out the number of packets received and
the number of packets with failed CRCs for every one second. The
ratio of the number of CRC errors to the total number of packets
whose header was decoded represents the error rate on the channel
due to random (multi-path fading) related wireless loss (recall that
there are no other co-channel transmitters in the test area thereby
ruling out hidden terminals and the SNR from the AP to the clients
is also above the association threshold).
From the ﬁgure it is clear that while the (link level) packet loss
rate seen with a single-element antenna transmission is around an
average value of 6.5%, the use of beamforming reduces the losses
to less than 0.4% for the same transmitted power. We highlight that
the impact is higher when considering higher layer protocols such
as TCP which are sensitive to losses and delay. Thus, we conclude
that the beamforming solution effectively handles multi-path fading
related channel impairments. Consequently, the (UDP) throughput
of the link remains stable without ﬂuctuations to channel fading as
can be observed in Figure 3.1.
3.3 Connectivity and coverage improvements
We investigate whether the beamforming solution improves the
connectivity of clients and reduces coverage holes. To do this, we
pick speciﬁc spots (near locations 3 and 5 in Figure 2), that are
not within connectivity range when using an Omni antenna at the
Tx. In these locations, the client cannot associate with the AP since
the received power is below the association threshold. We then run
