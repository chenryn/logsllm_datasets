Agenda
• DLL
• VBA
• COM
• VSTO
• Prevention and Detection
2
PUBLIC
Motivations
• It’s –everywhere- and it’s got lots of use cases
• Office templates? What else?
3
PUBLIC
Word … Linked Libraries?
• It’s just a DLL …
• “… are standard Windows DLLs that implement and export specific methods 
to extend Word functionality”
• “… no enhancements and no documentation updates to Word WLLs since 
Microsoft Office 97”
4
PUBLIC
Excel (XLL?) too …
• Slightly more updated … latest SDK from 2007.
• You need to export the right functions.
• Also slightly more configuration:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Excel\Options

DLL Add-Ins 
for Word and Excel
PUBLIC
Excel VBA Add-Ins
• It’s all VBA, no spreadsheets.
• *.xla // *.xlam
7
PUBLIC
PowerPoint VBA Add-Ins
• *.ppa // *.ppam
• Again, it’s inconsistent, and needs manual configuration:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\PowerPoint\AddIns\

VBA Add-Ins
for Excel and PowerPoint
… and others
PUBLIC
COM in Two Minutes
• Based on OLE and ActiveX – it’s a standard to enable component interaction.
• COM objects, DLLs and .Net
10
PUBLIC
COM Add-Ins for *
• COM – the legacy way is always a good way.
• The “IDTExtensibility2” interface.
• Registration can be problematic …
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\\Addins\
• Register with “regasm.exe /codebase InconspicuousAddIn.dll”.
11
PUBLIC
=sum(calc) with Excel Automation Add-Ins
• Specific COM use case – for user defined functions.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Excel\Options
• Register again with “regasm.exe”.

Attacking VBA Snoopers with VBE Add-Ins
• Why? Why? Why?
• More registry edits, more “regasm.exe”
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\VBE\6.0\Addins\
14
PUBLIC
COM Add-Ins
PUBLIC
*.VSTO
• Visual Studio Tools for Office – it’s a COM replacement and requires a special 
runtime.
• Build and install – very, very loudly.
16
PUBLIC
VSTO Add-Ins
PUBLIC
Defending Against Malicious Add-Ins
• Easy for XLL, COM, Automation, and VSTO add-ins:
• If required – sign and disable notifications.
18
PUBLIC
Defending Against Malicious Add-Ins
• For WLL and VBA add-ins … not so much. 
• (1) Remove or relocate trusted locations.
• (2) Detective capability: 
– Monitor trusted locations for changes
– Monitor registry keys used to enable add-ins.
– Process relationships.
