## Agenda
1. DLL
2. VBA
3. COM
4. VSTO
5. Prevention and Detection

## Motivations
- Microsoft Office is ubiquitous and has a wide range of use cases.
- Office templates and other features can be exploited for malicious purposes.

## Word â€¦ Linked Libraries?
- **Word WLL (Word Library Link)**
  - WLLs are standard Windows DLLs that extend Word functionality.
  - No enhancements or documentation updates have been made to Word WLLs since Microsoft Office 97.

## Excel (XLL?)
- **Excel XLL (Excel Add-In)**
  - The latest SDK for XLLs was released in 2007.
  - Specific functions must be exported to work correctly.
  - Additional configuration is required:
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Excel\Options`

## DLL Add-Ins for Word and Excel
- DLLs can be used as add-ins for both Word and Excel to extend their functionality.

## Excel VBA Add-Ins
- **VBA Add-Ins for Excel**
  - These are purely VBA-based, without spreadsheets.
  - File extensions: `.xla` or `.xlam`

## PowerPoint VBA Add-Ins
- **VBA Add-Ins for PowerPoint**
  - File extensions: `.ppa` or `.ppam`
  - Inconsistent and require manual configuration:
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\PowerPoint\AddIns\`

## VBA Add-Ins for Excel and PowerPoint
- VBA add-ins can be created for various Office applications, including Excel and PowerPoint.

## COM in Two Minutes
- **Component Object Model (COM)**
  - Based on OLE and ActiveX, COM is a standard for enabling component interaction.
  - COM objects, DLLs, and .Net assemblies can be used.

## COM Add-Ins for Office Applications
- **COM Add-Ins**
  - COM is a legacy but effective method for extending Office applications.
  - Uses the `IDTExtensibility2` interface.
  - Registration can be problematic and requires registry edits:
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\\Addins\`
  - Register using: `regasm.exe /codebase InconspicuousAddIn.dll`

## User-Defined Functions with Excel Automation Add-Ins
- **Excel Automation Add-Ins**
  - Used for user-defined functions.
  - Registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Excel\Options`
  - Register using: `regasm.exe`

## Attacking VBA Snoopers with VBE Add-Ins
- **VBE Add-Ins**
  - Why use them? For more advanced and stealthy attacks.
  - Requires additional registry edits and `regasm.exe`.
  - Registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VBA\VBE\6.0\Addins\`

## VSTO Add-Ins
- **Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO)**
  - A modern replacement for COM, requiring a special runtime.
  - Build and installation processes are more complex and visible.

## Defending Against Malicious Add-Ins
- **For XLL, COM, Automation, and VSTO Add-Ins**
  - Sign and disable notifications if necessary.
- **For WLL and VBA Add-Ins**
  - Remove or relocate trusted locations.
  - Monitor trusted locations for changes.
  - Monitor registry keys used to enable add-ins.
  - Analyze process relationships.
