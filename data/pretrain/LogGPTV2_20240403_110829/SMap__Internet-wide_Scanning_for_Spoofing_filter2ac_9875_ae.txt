Figure 13: Spoofable ratio according to networks’ sizes. Net-
work size is calculated from GeoLite2-ASN database.
For instance, most NSP networks are large, with CIDR/6. This is
aligned with our finding that among NSP networks there was the
highest number of spoofable networks.

6 CONCLUSIONS
Much effort is invested to understand the extent of spoofability in
the Internet. However, current measurement studies have limited
applicability, providing results that apply to a small set of Internet
networks.
Our work provides the first comprehensive view of ingress fil-
tering in the Internet. We showed how to improve the coverage
of the Internet in ingress filtering measurements to include many
more ASes that were previously not studied. Our techniques al-
low to cover more than 90% of the Internet ASes, in contrast to
best coverage so far of 7.5% of the ASes performed by the Spoofer
Project. This coverage can be further extended to include 100% of
the Internet’s ASes by scanning the IPv4 range instead of opting
for the dataset of [2], that we used in our study.
The most significant aspect of our methodologies is that they
do not require coordination with the scanned networks. SMap can
measure spoofability in any TCP/IP network with standard and
widely supported services, such as Email and web. We integrated
into SMap three techniques for testing ingress filtering: DNS-based,
Figure 12: Spoofable ratio across ASes’ types. AS type is
queried from PeeringDB.
According to our study enterprise and non-profit networks en-
force ingress filtering more than other networks. In contrast, NSPs
contain the most networks that do not enforce ingress filtering.
There is a strong correlation between the AS size and the en-
forcement of spoofing, see Figure 13. Essentially, the larger the AS,
the higher the probability that our tools identify that it does not
filter spoofed packets. The reason can be directly related to our
methodologies and the design of our study: the larger the network
the more services it hosts. This means that we have more possibil-
ities to test if spoofing is possible: for instance, we can identify a
higher fraction of servers with a globally incremental IPID counters,
which are not “load balanced”. In Figure 14 we plot the statistics of
the tested networks according to their size and type. The results
show a correlation between the size of the network and its type.

IPID-based and PMTUD-based. Our experimental comparison of
the effectiveness of the techniques demonstrated that DNS-based
technique has a wider applicability rate on networks that operate
DNS resolvers than the other two techniques, while the detection
of the spoofability of networks is more accurate with PMTUD.
We set up SMap as a public service for continuous collection and
analysis of the ingress filtering in the Internet at
