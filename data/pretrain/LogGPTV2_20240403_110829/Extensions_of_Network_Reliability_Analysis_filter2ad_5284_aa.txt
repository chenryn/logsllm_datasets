Abstract—Network reliability studies properties of networks
subjected to random failures of their components. It has been
widely adopted to modeling and analyzing real-world prob-
lems across different domains, such as circuit design, genomics,
databases, information propagation, network security, and many
others. Two practical situations that usually arise from such
problems are (i) the correlation between component failures and
(ii) the uncertainty in failure probabilities. Previous work [19]
captured correlations by modeling component reliability using
general Boolean expression of Bernoulli random variables. This
paper extends such a model to address the second problem, where
we investigate the use of Beta distributions to capture the variance
of uncertainty. We call this new formalism the Beta uncertain
graph. We study the reliability polynomials of Beta uncertain
graphs as multivariate polynomials of Beta random variables
and demonstrate the use of the model on two realistic examples.
We also observe that the reliability distribution of a monotone
Beta uncertain graph can be approximated by a Beta distribution,
usually with high accuracy. Numerical results from Monte Carlo
simulation of an approximation scheme and from two case studies
strongly support this observation.
Keywords—network reliability, correlated failures, uncertainty,
Beta distribution.

INTRODUCTION
A classic problem in reliability takes a graph, identiﬁes
a source node s and a destination node t and asks for the
probability of a path existing from s to t in the presence of
random link failures. This is sometimes known as the two-
terminal reliability problem. The literature is rich with results
on the difﬁculty of this problem and means of computing that
probability. Existing work invariably embodies two underlying
assumptions. First, that the probabilities of edges failing or
not within a given mission time are independent random
variables. Second, that the probabilities are known, implicitly
with precision. It is not difﬁcult to imagine or construct graphs
where edge failures are not stochastically independent, for
example if link failure is caused by a combination of root
causes then links that share a root cause will have correlated
failure probabilities. Precision (or certainty) in link failure
probabilities depends on state of knowledge, and more may
be known about some links than others. A natural question
asks how the certainty in the predicted system probability is
impacted by the certainty (or lack of it) in edge probabilities.
The ﬁeld of Bayesian statistics offers insights into means
of describing probabilities and certainty about them. There a
probability is represented by a distribution–itself a probability
distribution. Distributions with narrow peaked shape describe
greatest certainty of the probability, at the highest point of
the peak. A distribution that is broader and ﬂatter indicates
less certainty. Bayesian statistics uses the Beta distribution,
largely because modiﬁcations to the probability description
based on observations can be made with the resulting distri-
bution remaining in the Beta family. Given a Beta distribution
description of a probability, the mean captures the central
tendency, and the standard deviation captures the certainty. The
smaller the standard deviation, the higher the conﬁdence.
to use. For example,
The Beta distribution has a number of other nice properties
that make it convenient
the mirror
image of a Beta distribution is also a Beta distribution; we
identify some other useful properties. The work we present is
motivated by the desire to use Beta distributions to describe
network link failures, do some analysis, and have at the end a
Beta distribution that describes the overall s − t connectivity
probability. If we are able to do so, we can gain insight into the
certainty of connectivity probability by comparing the standard
deviation relative to the mean, and furthermore can determine
the sensitivity of the connectivity probability’s certainty to the
certainty of component link probabilities. This latter capability
might guide one to links where, if by greater research one can
reduce the uncertainty in the link failure probability, one can
most signiﬁcantly reduce the uncertainty in the overall s − t
connection probability.
Readers familiar already with network reliability analysis
know or suspect that by introducing probability distributions
we are making a computationally complex problem even more
complex. Those same readers will know or suspect that the
details of path expression in representations such as reliability
polynomials are unlikely to prettily preserve Beta distributions
through all
their machinations. Both instincts are correct.
What we do in this paper is lay out the formalism which
can in principle be applied to any network of any size, in
a way that expresses network reliability recursively, which
allows one to combine analysis of smaller systems into an
analysis of a larger system. We approximate random variables
within the decomposition as Betas—even when we know that
rigorously they are not—and use Monte Carlo sampling to
compute empirical distributions from which parameters for
the approximating Betas are derived. The intuition is that by
assuming an underlying distribution we get more predictive
power out of each Monte Carlo sample; for the same number
of samples we hope to achieve tighter conﬁdence intervals.
We do these steps with some rigor, using best practice tech-
niques from computational statistics. By resorting (by need)
to a simulation-based empirical approach, we are not forced
into combinatorially complex exact calculations, and so even
though we have brought added complexity to the model, we
have not painted ourselves into an “impossible to compute”
corner.
We start by brieﬂy showing in Section II how to extend the
formalism of uncertain graphs to accommodate correlation in
edge existence probabilities, and with this extension introduce
the notion of a Bernoulli uncertain graph, where (poten-

tially correlated) edge probabilities are described by a single
probability value. In Section III we introduce Beta uncertain
graphs where the edge probabilities are replaced by a Beta
distribution, and describe how a Beta uncertain graph can be
viewed as a generator of Bernoulli uncertain graphs. In Section
IV we bring the extended machinery of uncertain graphs to
the problem of modeling network reliability. In Section V we
identify properties of reliability polynomials whose random
variables are from the Beta family. Some of these properties
allow us to express and easily compute upper and lower bounds
(in a distributional sense) on the overall system reliability.
Here we also discuss means of approximating the reliability
distribution through parameter estimation of Beta, rather than
through direct estimation of the distribution itself. In Section
VI we validate the approach. Finally, in Section VII we apply
our results to the study of two very different cases, one a
computer network, the other a natural gas distribution network.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. Uncertain graphs
Let G = (V,E) denote a directed graph1 where
V = {V1, V2, . . . , Vn} is the set of n vertices and E =
{E1, E2, . . . , Em} ⊆ V × V the set m of edges; we call
G a deterministic graph. An uncertain graph (UG), formally
deﬁned as a tuple G = (V,E, p), makes edge existence
random, with edge Ei existing (independently) with probability
pi ∈ [0, 1]. We call p the probability assignment vector of E.
An UG may contain both certain edges – edges that either
do not exist or exist with certainty – and uncertain edges –
edges that exist with probability strictly greater than zero and
smaller than one. When all edges are certain edges, an UG is
a deterministic graph. In the literature, UGs are sometimes
treated as generative models of deterministic graphs. Any

possible world of G. Slightly abusing the notation, we denote
this as G ∈ G. Similar to saying a fair coin generates the head
1While most of the discussion in this paper focuses on directed graphs,
extending the results to undirected graphs is straightforward and only requires
a minor modiﬁcation to the deﬁnition of reliability.

The UG G generates 2m possible worlds, out of which only
(cid:2) ≤ m is
2m(cid:2)
the number of uncertain edges in G. Obviously 0 ≤ wG(G) ≤ 1
for all G ∈ G and since the set of possible worlds are mutually
exclusive and exhausive,
G∈G wG(G) = 1.
(cid:3)
This UG formalism asserts edge independence, which
neglects correlation between uncertain edges due to common
underlying causes. This characteristic arises in practical sit-
uations and is discussed in our ﬁrst case study in Section
VII-A. To enable correlation, we use random variables to
model the edge existences while allowing the variables to
be jointly distributed. We call this formalism the extended
uncertain graphs2. Formally, an extended UG is deﬁned as
a tuple G = (V,E,X , φ) where V and E are the set of
vertices and edges as before, X = {X1, X2, . . . , Xr} the set
of r mutually independent random variables, and lastly φ an
assignment function. For each edge Ei ∈ E, φ(Ei) associates
Ei with a function of random variables in X , which tells
us how Ei and other edges in E are jointly distributed. In
particular, if φ assigns a unique random variable to each edge,
then the edges exist independently of the others. An example is
given in Figure 1. This small graph serves as a useful example
to illustrate many properties of the extended uncertain graphs
as we continue. To complete the deﬁnition, we further require
that for all Ei ∈ E, φ(Ei)’s support lie on [0, 1]. While this
deﬁnition is very broad, in this paper we are mostly interested
in random variables and assignment functions of speciﬁc types
discussed below.
B. Bernoulli uncertain graphs
Denote ¬ as the complement operator, i.e. P r(¬Xi =
1) = 1 − pi and ¬X = {¬Xi
: Xi ∈ X}. Let us ﬁrst
limit our attention to the simplest case in which Xi’s are
Bernoulli random variables, i.e. for all Xi ∈ X , P r(Xi =
1) = 1 − P r(Xi = 0) =p i ∈ [0, 1], and φ : E → X ∪ ¬X
maps each edge to either a random variable in X or its
complement. We refer to this deﬁnition the Bernoulli uncertain
graph. Furthermore, we call a Bernoulli UG monotone if the
range of the assignment function is restricted to φ : E → X .
2Our deﬁnition of extended UGs is a modiﬁcation of that
in [19] to
accommodate discussion on several types of extended UGs.
The deﬁnition of monotonicity is important as we shall see
later on, since there are many properties that only hold for the
case of monotone UGs.
Every basic UG (V,E, p) deﬁned in Section II-A is a
special monotone Bernoulli UG in which no random variable
is assigned to two distinct edges. Similar to basic UGs,
Bernoulli UGs are also generative models of deterministic
graphs. However, computing the probability that a Bernoulli
UG generates a possible world requires a slight modiﬁcation
to Equation 1 since edge existence may be correlated. Given a
Bernoulli UG G = (V,E,X , φ) and for any deterministic graph
) where E(cid:2) ⊆ E, G generates G with a nonzero

probability only if for every Xi ∈ X , either
1) all edges dependent on Xi are in E(cid:2) and no edge dependent
2) all edges dependent on ¬Xi are in E(cid:2) and no edge depen-
When that is the case, let XG be the subset of X satisfying
the ﬁrst condition, we have G generates G with probability
¬Xi is in E(cid:2), or
dent on Xi is in E(cid:2).

The way correlations in a Bernoulli UG are captured may
seem extreme, in the sense that it only seems to support either
no correlation, full positive correlation – where two edges are
assigned with the same variable – or full negative correlation –
where one edge is assigned with a variable and another edge its
complement. However it is possible to design more complex
assignment functions. In particular, we can assign an edge with
a general Boolean expression of Bernoulli random variables.
For example, deﬁne edge expressions φ(E1) =X 1 ∨ X2
and φ(E2) = X1 ∧ ¬X2 ∧ X3. Through such expressions
we can create positive or negative correlations, and with
appropriate choice of parameters of the shared variables tune
the statistical correlation between edge existence to any desired
value. Previous work [19] has shown that
the assignment
function deﬁned this way can describe any joint distribution
of edge existence probability. Morevover,
it is possible to
prove that the construction using general Boolean expressions
and the Bernoulli UG formalism as we have deﬁned are
mathematically equivalent. That said, this paper focuses on
monotone UG’s, which limits the sign of the correlations (but
not the magnitude).
III. BETA UNCERTAIN GRAPHS
Bernoulli UGs extend traditional UGs with the ability to
model correlation between uncertain edges. Still, it implicitly
requires the modeler to know the exact edge probabilities. In
practice, such numbers might not always be known. Many
times, estimating them from the data comes with uncertainty
