A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
all-partitions Shows all resources in all partitions. In this case, the resources in the shared parti-
tion are listed first. Then the resources in each private partition are listed, organized
by partition.
partition Shows only the resources in the specified partition.
{shared | partition-name}
Mode All
Usage The profile name must be specified before any partition names.
The all-partitions and partition partition-name options are applicable on
ACOS devices that are configured with L3V partitions. If you omit both options, only the
resources in the shared partition are shown. (If no partitions are configured, all resources are
in the shared partition, so you can omit both options.)
The all-partitions option is applicable only to admins with Root, Read-write, or Read-
only privileges. (See “show admin” on page243 for descriptions of the admin privilege
levels.)
When entered without the all or profile-name option, this command displays the
contents of the configuration profile that is currently linked to “startup-config”. Unless you
have relinked “startup-config”, the configuration profile that is displayed is the one that is
stored in the image area from which the ACOS device most recently rebooted.
Example The following example shows how to view the startup-config in partition “companyB” (trun-
cated for brevity):
ACOS# show startup-config partition companyB
Show startup-config profile in partition "companyB"

show system cpu-load-sharing
Description Displays CPU load sharing information.
CPU load sharing can be configured using the system cpu-load-sharing command.
Syntax show system cpu-load-sharing [statistics [detail]]
Parameter Description
statistics Shows CPU load sharing statistics.
detail Show per-CPU counters.
Mode All
Example The following command shows output from the CPU load sharing feature. In this example,
the counter for the “Load Sharing Trggered” field is incremented every time a CPU enters into
load-sharing mode. Similarly, the counter for the “Load Sharing Untriggered” field is incre-
mented every time a CPU is subsequently removed from load-sharing mode.
ACOS(config)#show system cpu-load-sharing statistics

Example If the command is used without the statistics option, then the output simply displays
which CPUs are in load-sharing mode. The example below shows that CPU 1, CPU 2, and
CPU 3 are in load-sharing mode.
ACOS(config)#show system cpu-load-sharing

show system resource-usage
Description Display the minimum and maximum numbers of system resources that can be configured or
used, the default maximum number allowed by the configuration, and the number currently
in use.
For example, the “l4-session-count” row of the output shows the number of Layer 4 sessions
that are currently in use, as well as the maximum number currently supported by the
configuration (the default maximum), and the range of values that can be assigned to the
default maximum.
In general, if a resource listed in the output has the same value in the Current and Maximum
columns (GSLB resources, for example), then the allocation for that resource can not be
changed.
Syntax show system resource-usage [template [default | template-name]]
Mode All
Usage To change system resource usage settings, see “system resource-usage” on page200 com-
mand.
You must reload or reboot the system after making changes to system resource-usage
settings in order to place the changes into effect. For most system resource-usage settings, a
reload is sufficient. However, a change to the l4-session-count setting requires a reboot.
If the target device is not reloaded, the system resource-usage settings synchronized from
the active device appear in the standby device’s running-config, but do not actually take
effect until the reload or reboot.
• If you manually synchronize the configuration, you have the option to reload the target
device immediately following the synchronization. If you do not use this option, you
can reload the device later.
• If you are using VRRP-A in combination with aVCS, configuration synchronization is
automatic. In this case, you must reload or reboot the target device to place the system
resource-usage changes into effect.
NOTE: The target device is not automatically reloaded following configuration synchroni-
zation.
Example Below is a sample output for this command.
