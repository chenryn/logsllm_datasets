Fig.  12  summarizes  the  whole  architecture.    In  each 
round  of  SHM,  a  number  of  samples  are  collect  at  each 
sensor node. Based on the measured data, each sensor node 
identifies its natural frequencies. After the natural frequency 
matching, the faulty sensor nodes are detected and isolated. 
Mode  shapes  of  each  cluster  are  identified  and  assembled 
together.  Possible  structural  damage  is  then  detected  and 
located by examining mode shape curvatures.

IV.  SIMULATION 
A.  System Description 
To  test  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  approach,  a 
simulated  suspension  bridge  is  generated  by  a  commercial 
software  SAP2000  [21].    Some  important  dimensions  of 
the bridge are also marked in Fig. 13(a). 
A  total  of  114  sensor  nodes  are  used  to  monitor  the 
vibration at the transverse direction (z direction in Fig.13 (a)) 
of the deck of the bridge. These sensors are evenly spaced at 
the outer side and inner side in the middle span of the deck 
with distance of 2m (see Fig. 13(b)). The number of sensor 
nodes in the left span, middle span and right span are 28, 58 
and 28, respectively.

In  the  simulation,  data  from  these  sensor  nodes  are 
generated  when  the  bridge  is  under  a  transverse  impact 
located at the center. The time series were sampled at 100Hz. 
2%  zero-mean  Gaussian  noise  is  added  to  each  sample  to 
simulate  environmental  noise.  During  the impact  test, 1024 
data are sampled and stored in each node. We also assume 
the communication range of each node is 10m.   
According  to  the  spans  they  belong,  sensor  nodes  are 
divided into three substructures. We use the 58 sensor nodes 
in  the  middle  span  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  our  propose 
approach.    For  convenience,  all  these  sensor  nodes  in  this 
span are numbered and illustrated in Fig. 15.

Damage in the bridge is generated by generating a crack 
on the grey area in Fig. 15.    In addition, from the 58 sensor 
nodes,  we  randomly  select  6  sensor  nodes,  namely

that these faulty sensor nodes have random -50%~50% shift 
on  each  of  the  natural  frequencies  obtained  when  they  are 
healthy.  In  the  following  sections,  we  will  demonstrate  the 
proposed scheme is able correctly detect structural damage in 
the presence of these faulty sensor nodes. 
B.  Clustering 
First,  the  sensor  nodes  in  the  middle  span  are  divided 
into overlapping clusters. The results using the first and the 
second  methods  proposed  in  section  III.A  are  illustrated  in 
Fig. 16 (a) and (b), respectively. Both methods partition the 
58 sensor nodes into 6 clusters. Particularly, for the second 
method, 5 clusters are obtained after all the sensor nodes are 
covered. These 5 clusters form 3 isolated cluster groups (i.e. 
{#1,#5},{#2},  and{#3,#4}  in  Fig.  16(b)).  Accordingly,  an 
extra cluster, #6, is added to make them overlap. 
sensor #36, #3 and #9, the std((cid:2280)(cid:2929))  drops significantly. This 
7 iterations.  It can  be  seen  that by  iteratively  removing  the 
trend stops after #9 is removed. Therefore, these three sensor 
nodes are labeled as faulty.    Faulty sensor nodes have been 
successfully detected using frequency matching technique.

C.  Extract Natural Frequency Set in Each Cluster 
In this section, we will identify natural frequencies. For 
each  cluster,  the  CH  broadcasts  its  data  to  its  cluster 
members.  After  obtained  the  data,  each  sensor  node 
calculates  its  CSD  and  uses  the  PP  method  to  extract  8 
largest peaks. In this paper, the ith point of a CSD is a peak if: 
(16a)
(16b)
where CSD(i(cid:3398)1) , CSD(i)   and CSD(i(cid:3397)1)   are  the 
(i-1)th,  ith,  and  (i+1)th  points  of  CSD,  respectively.   (cid:2013)  is  a

positive  threshold  that  can  be  adjusted  according  to  the 
historical data. If less than 8 peaks are found, zeros will be 
returned in place of the missing peaks. If more than 8 peaks 
are  found,  the  highest  8  peaks  are  adopted.  Eq.  (16)  also 
applies  to  PSD  for  CH.    Hereinafter,  we  use  the  topology 
illustrated  in  Fig.  16(a)  as  an  example.  The  CSDs  and 
corresponding peaks from some of sensor nodes in the first 
cluster are illustrated in Fig. 17.   
The  peaks  in  each  CSD  correspond  to  the  natural 
frequencies  of  the  associated  sensor.  The  extracted  natural 
frequencies  from  all  16  sensors  in  the  first  cluster  are 
illustrated in Fig. 18.

In a similar manner, the remaining faulty sensor nodes 
#15,  #27,#48  are  also  correctly  identified  in  cluster  2/6,  5, 
and 3, respectively. 
D.  Structural Damage Detection and Localization 
After  all  the  faulty  sensor  nodes  have  detected  and 
isolated,  the  remaining  52  sensor  nodes  are  used  to  detect 
possible structural damage.   
The CSD of each sensor is sent back to the corresponding 
CH.  After  a  CH  receives  all  the  CSDs  from  its  cluster 
members, it implements the ERA to extract the mode shapes

46in its cluster. The mode shapes extracted in each cluster are 
assembled  together  and  obtained  the  mode  shapes  for  the 
whole substructure. Note that in the mode shape assembling, 
mode shapes from different clusters must correspond to the 
same  set  of  natural  frequencies.  In  this  test,  mode  shapes 
corresponding to the natural frequency set {2.85Hz, 3.55Hz, 
4.67Hz,  5.86Hz}  are  chosen.  All  these  natural  frequencies 
can  be  correctly  identified  in  all  the  52  sensor  nodes 
(although  the  actual  identified  values  in  each  sensor  are 
slightly deviated from this set due to the simulated noise).   
After we obtained the mode shapes, we should notice that
