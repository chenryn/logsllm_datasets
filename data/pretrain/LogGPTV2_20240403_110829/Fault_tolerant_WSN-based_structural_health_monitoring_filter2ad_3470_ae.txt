### Figure 12: Summary of the Whole Architecture

Figure 12 summarizes the overall architecture. In each round of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), a number of samples are collected at each sensor node. Based on the measured data, each sensor node identifies its natural frequencies. After matching these natural frequencies, faulty sensor nodes are detected and isolated. The mode shapes for each cluster are then identified and assembled. Potential structural damage is detected and located by examining the curvatures of the mode shapes.

### IV. Simulation

#### A. System Description

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulated suspension bridge was generated using the commercial software SAP2000 [21]. Key dimensions of the bridge are marked in Figure 13(a).

A total of 114 sensor nodes were used to monitor the vibration in the transverse direction (z-direction in Figure 13(a)) of the bridge deck. These sensors were evenly spaced on the outer and inner sides of the middle span of the deck, with a distance of 2 meters between each sensor (see Figure 13(b)). The distribution of sensor nodes across the left, middle, and right spans is 28, 58, and 28, respectively.

For illustration, the first four natural frequencies and their corresponding mode shapes are shown in Figure 14.

#### B. Clustering

The sensor nodes in the middle span were divided into overlapping clusters. The results using the first and second methods proposed in Section III.A are illustrated in Figures 16(a) and 16(b), respectively. Both methods partitioned the 58 sensor nodes into 6 clusters. For the second method, 5 clusters were initially obtained, forming 3 isolated cluster groups (i.e., {#1, #5}, {#2}, and {#3, #4} in Figure 16(b)). An additional cluster, #6, was added to ensure overlap.

#### C. Extracting Natural Frequency Set in Each Cluster

In this section, we identify the natural frequencies. For each cluster, the cluster head (CH) broadcasts its data to its cluster members. After receiving the data, each sensor node calculates its Cross-Spectral Density (CSD) and uses the Peak Picking (PP) method to extract the 8 largest peaks. A point in the CSD is considered a peak if it satisfies the following conditions:
- \( \text{CSD}(i) - \text{CSD}(i-1) \geq \theta \)
- \( \text{CSD}(i) - \text.CSD(i+1) \geq \theta \)

where \(\text{CSD}(i-1)\), \(\text{CSD}(i)\), and \(\text{CSD}(i+1)\) are the (i-1)th, ith, and (i+1)th points of the CSD, respectively, and \(\theta\) is a positive threshold that can be adjusted based on historical data. If fewer than 8 peaks are found, zeros are returned in place of the missing peaks. If more than 8 peaks are found, the highest 8 peaks are adopted. Equation (16) also applies to the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for the CH.

Using the topology illustrated in Figure 16(a) as an example, the CSDs and corresponding peaks from some sensor nodes in the first cluster are shown in Figure 17. The peaks in each CSD correspond to the natural frequencies of the associated sensor. The extracted natural frequencies from all 16 sensors in the first cluster are illustrated in Figure 18.

Based on the identified natural frequencies, we calculate the standard deviation of the comparability matrix \(\mathbf{C}\) and \(\mathbf{S}\). Figure 19 shows the standard deviation of \(\mathbf{S}\) after each iteration. By iteratively removing the faulty sensor nodes, the trend stabilizes after the removal of sensor #9. Therefore, sensor nodes #36, #3, and #9 are labeled as faulty. Similarly, the remaining faulty sensor nodes #15, #27, and #48 are correctly identified in clusters 2/6, 5, and 3, respectively.

#### D. Structural Damage Detection and Localization

After all faulty sensor nodes have been detected and isolated, the remaining 52 sensor nodes are used to detect possible structural damage. The CSD of each sensor is sent back to the corresponding CH. After a CH receives all the CSDs from its cluster members, it implements the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) to extract the mode shapes within its cluster. The mode shapes extracted in each cluster are assembled together to obtain the mode shapes for the entire substructure. It is important to note that mode shapes from different clusters must correspond to the same set of natural frequencies. In this test, mode shapes corresponding to the natural frequency set {2.85 Hz, 3.55 Hz, 4.67 Hz, 5.86 Hz} were chosen. All these natural frequencies were correctly identified in all 52 sensor nodes, although the actual values in each sensor may slightly deviate due to simulated noise.

After obtaining the mode shapes, we should examine them to detect and locate any structural damage.
