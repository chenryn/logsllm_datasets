User: I'm running Python 2.6.2 on XP. I have a large number of text files (100k+) spread across several folders that I would like to consolidate in a single folder on an external drive.
I've tried using shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() and distutils.file_util.copy_file() to copy files from source to destination. None of these methods has successfully copied all files from a source folder, and each attempt has ended with IOError Errno 13 Permission Denied and I am unable to create a new destination file. 
I have noticed that all the destination folders I've used, regardless of the source folders used, have ended up with exactly 13,106 files. I cannot open any new files for writing in folders that have this many (or more files), which may be why I'm getting Errno 13.
I'd be grateful for suggestions on whether and why this problem is occurring.
many thanks,
nick
Assistant: I wouldn't have that many files in a single folder, it is a maintenance nightmare. BUT if you need to, don't do this on FAT: you have max. 64k files in a FAT folder. 
Read the error message
Your specific problem could also be be, that you as the error message suggests are hitting a file which you can't access. And there's no reason to believe that the count of files until this happens should change. It is a computer after all, and you are repeating the same operation.
