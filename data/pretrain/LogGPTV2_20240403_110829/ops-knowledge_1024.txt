User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Queued ingestion and data latencies:
How can I shorten queued ingestion latencies?

Assistant: You can [learn about latencies](batching-policy.md#batching-latencies) and [adjust settings in the batching policy](batching-policy.md) to address issues that cause latencies such as data backlogs, inefficient batching, batching large amounts of uncompressed data, or ingesting very small amounts of data.
