**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Restrict File and Directory Permissions

Restricting user permissions to prevent them from deleting or modifying specific files, such as `~/.bash_history` or `ConsoleHost_history.txt`, can help mitigate the risk of adversaries maliciously altering these files. By limiting write and delete access, you can ensure that these critical files remain intact and unaltered, thereby enhancing system security.
