information of a large number of smart homes at scale.
9.2 Limitations
Real users may cause conflicts in device statuses, which cannot
be avoided by SniffMislead as SniffMislead cannot predict the
behaviors of real users. For example, SniffMislead creates a fake
"Window-Opened" event at 10:00, and then a real user opens the
window, creating a "Window-Opened" event at 10:15 again. An
attacker who observes the two events may know that the event at
10:00 is fake and that the one at 10:15 is real because SniffMislead
does not create a "Window-Opened" event for a window that is
already open. To deal with this, our future work plans to extend
SniffMislead as follows. First, it could inject packets after the
conflicts arise to mislead the attacker’s inference about the cur-
rent statuses of IoT devices. For example, if a phantom user closes
the window soon (with a random duration) after 10:15, then the
attacker is not sure about the current status of the window. Second,
SniffMislead could occasionally create a small number of conflicts,
so the attacker is not sure whether a conflict has been caused by the
real user or SniffMislead. For example, it can sometimes inject a
fake "Window-Opened" event after a real "Window-Opened" event.
SniffMislead cannot inject decoy packets for IoT devices that
use cellular networks (e.g., 4G/5G) over a licensed spectrum, be-
cause SniffMislead cannot use a licensed spectrum. Note that
most existing IoT devices do not use cellular networks, which incur
monthly fees.
10 CONCLUSION
We proposed SniffMislead, which can effectively defend against
passive attackers who sniff encrypted wireless traffic to infer user
privacy-sensitive information. SniffMislead is a non-intrusive
wireless packet injection tool, developed using a stand-alone de-
vice, without modifying IoT devices, hubs, platforms, or communi-
cation protocols. It works without requiring manual configurations.
SniffMislead uses a top-down approach to place indistinguish-
able phantom users, who “live” in a home like real users would,
preventing attackers from making reliable inferences about device
states and user behaviors. The real smart home testbed evaluation
showed that SniffMislead significantly reduced a wireless sniffing
attacker’s capability of behavior inference; as a result, the attackers
could not be able to tell whether an inferred event was real or not
and could not distinguish between real and phantom users. There-
fore, SniffMislead can provide effective, resilient and self-adaptive
privacy protection for smart homes.
