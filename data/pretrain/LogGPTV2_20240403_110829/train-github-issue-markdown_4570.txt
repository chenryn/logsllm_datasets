 **Elasticsearch version** : 2.3.0
**Plugins installed** : [head, decompound, naturalsort]
**JVM version** : 1.8.0_03
**OS version** : Linux Mint 18
**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :
When performing a multi_match query with fuzziness enabled results with typos
have higher score than exact matches. The expected behavior should give exact
matches higher score than fuzzy matches.
**Steps to reproduce** :
  1. Create the search index with the provided index settings (index.txt)
  2. Insert the documents with the following values for the field "username": user100, user1000, user1001, user1002, user1003, user1004
  3. Execute the multi_match query (query.txt)
  4. The first few results are "user1000", "user1001", "user1002" etc. instead "user100"
**Provide logs (if relevant)** : /
This issue is a duplicate of #3125. But somehow this issue isn't fixed yet,
although the Lucene bugfix https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-329 is
marked as solved.
