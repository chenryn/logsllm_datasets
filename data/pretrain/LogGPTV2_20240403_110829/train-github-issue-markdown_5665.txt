The behavior of attributes with a value of `null` or `undefined` is
inconsistent. On first render they are not present on the element at all. On
subsequent renders, the attribute sticks around with an empty value.
For example, `` renders what you expect (``), but if the
value of `href` changes to `null` after the first render, you get ``. In the case of `href` (and likely others) an empty attribute has
unintended side effects.
