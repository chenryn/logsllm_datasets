User: I am working with RedHat Linux 5.6 (in case that matters).
My team is working with python 2.6.6. I installed it from source (configure, make, make install) from the official Python site. It seems to not work properly:

When I type python in the terminal to enter the Python CLI, for some reason I can't delete what I type (backspace prints character marks to screen)
Modules like psutils are missing (this should be a standard part of Python, no?)

Python 2.4, which was previously installed, works fine.
Any ideas?
Assistant: Install readline-devel from yum and then recompile Python. Command line editing magics require this library.
