Abstract. The full vision of the Semantic Web has yet to be fully accomplished, but there has been
considerable progress in the development and use of standards, languages, technologies and
applications. While mainstream adoption is still five to ten years away, there is an imperative need
for a survey that will paint a clear picture for practitioners describing the “semantic” road that is
being followed. The aim of this article is to present a snapshot that can capture key trends in the
Semantic Web, such as application domains, tools, systems, languages and techniques being used,
and a projection on when organizations will put their full-blown systems into production.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the past 6 years our community has seen continuous, sustained growth in the deployment of
Semantic Web inventiveness in large and small organizations of many types. Much effort has been
made towards achieving the vision of a machine-readable World Wide Web—the Semantic Web.
Many researchers and practitioners are already starting to believe that a new Web is emerging
based on the ongoing research and developments. Some industries, and its main players, are
shifting from a “wait-and-see” approach (Cardoso, Miller et al. 2005) to the real-world deployment
of applications that will give them added value and a competitive advantage. To see how the
Semantic Web is becoming real, one need only look to companies such as Oracle, Vodafone,
Amazon.com, Adobe, Yahoo, and Google. All of these organizations are working for a smarter
Web and some of their implementations are already available on the Web. For example, Oracle has
introduced the industry’s first RDF (Decker, Melnik et al., 2000) management platform, targeting
application areas such as life sciences (Stephens, Morales et al. 2006), data and content integration,
enterprise application integration, and supply chain integration. Oracle is already working on
extending the platform with OWL support. Vodafone, a leading mobile phone company, has used
RDF to describe and search ring tones, games and pictures in their Web site. As a result, the page
viewed per download has decreased by 50% and revenues have risen by 20%. Many more
successful examples could be enumerated.
We have witnessed a significant evolution of standards as improvements and innovations allow
the delivery of more complex, more sophisticated and more far-reaching semantic applications. For
the Semantic Web vision to become reality in everyday life, it is indispensable at this stage to
present a snapshot that will capture certain key trends in the Semantic Web, the current
developments and determine how researchers and practitioners are using and interrelating semantic
technologies. Therefore, the results of a survey are presented here, so that we may keep a finger on
the pulse of our community and demonstrate the variability and dynamism of the work being done
on the Semantic Web, by looking at the picture that this survey paints for us.

2. SURVEY OVERVIEW
The aim of the survey is to give an account of current Semantic Web practices. The findings
reported in this article are based on 627 surveys that were filled in and conducted within a two
month period. The data was collected from 12 December 2006 to 26 January 2007. The participants
were requested to answer 14 questions related to particular aspects of the Semantic Web and its
technologies. The study covered close-ended questions. The participants were allowed to choose
from multiple choice answers. Out of the 14 questions, 8 contained an option for “other” to be
filled in. The survey was carried out electronically and an e-mail was sent to several mailing lists
and discussion groups to request volunteers. The e-mail was sent to the following entities:
DBWorld, SemanticWeb googlegroups, comp.ai.nat-lang, comp.ai, Music Ontology Specification
googlegroups, comp.lang.lisp, and semantic-web@w3.org. Additionally, we sent approximately 40
personal invitations to people involved in academic and industrial research.
3. SURVEY DESIGN
The survey can be divided into five categories: Demographics, Tools and Languages, Ontology,
Ontology Size, and Production. The demographics category had three questions intended to
describe the most important facts about each participant that answered the survey. Namely, we
asked in which type of organization they were working, their primary role, and the number of years
of professional experience. The second category, tools and languages, was composed of three
questions and focused explicitly on the tools used to build ontologies and the ontology languages
used. The third part of the survey, ontology, contained 4 questions. The interviewees indicated for
which industry or domain they are developing ontologies, which methodology they use to develop
their ontologies, and why they use ontologies. The last question assessed the use of mapping,
aligning, merging, and integrating ontologies. The fourth category, ontology size, contained 3
questions all related to the size of the ontologies developed. Participants were asked how many
concepts had the smallest, a typical, and the biggest ontology in their organization. The last part of
the survey, production, comprised only one question which focused on the assessment of the
estimated timeframe to put the developed ontologies and associated systems into production.
Organization – We were impressed by both the size of the sample – the number of people who
responded – and the distribution of the sample among academia and industry, and geographical
locations. These elements all suggest that the data will be representative of the broad scope of
Semantic Web projects today. Each respondent was asked in what type of organization they
worked. Sixty-six percent of the respondents identified themselves as affiliated to academia, 18.4%
to industry, and 16% worked in academia and industry (see Figure 1).

The nature of the respondents’ organization means that this survey tilted slightly toward an
academia perspective, as opposed to an industrial or commercial perspective. We believe that this
reflects the market in general. We were particularly impressed by the number of respondents that
work actively in academia and industry. This may indicate a strong technology transfer from
universities to companies in the next few years. There seems to be an emergent call to identify
research results from the Semantic Web for potential commercial interests and to develop strategies
for how best to exploit the Semantic Web in industry.
Participant Role – Each respondent was asked to describe his role within his organization. Almost
twenty-two percent of the respondents identified themselves as researchers. Roughly equal
numbers identified themselves as professors (12.5%), knowledge engineers (12%), programmers
(12%), project manager (11.1%), or system analysts and designer (11.1%). Only 9.2% identified
themselves as architects and 5% as students. More than five percent identified themselves as
belonging to another category (e.g. consultant, CTO, Business Analyst). (See Figure 2.)

The nature of the respondents’ role demonstrates that there is a good sample distribution of
roles in this survey which includes architects, programmers, systems analysts and professors.
Nevertheless, the survey tilted slightly toward a research perspective as seen in Figure 2.
Professional Experience – Each respondent was asked the number of years of professional
experience they had had in their role. Only a small fraction of the participants (6.8%) had less than
one year of experience. Most had more than 6 years of experience in their role (35%). The number
of participants with experience of between 1-2 (21.5%), 3-4 (23.1%), and 5-6 (13.6%) years was
also significant; they comprised 58.2%. This diversity suggests that the data will be representative
of the broad scope of professionals with different experience (Figure 3).

Ontology Editors. We asked respondents to tell us which ontology editors they were currently
using in their organizations, and their responses have been summarized in Figure 4. The editor
most frequently cited was Protégé with a market share of 68.2%. The results clearly point out that
Protégé is ahead of all other editors. Approximately equal numbers of respondents use SWOOP
(13.6%), OntoEdit (12.2%) (OntoEdit is now called OntoStudio), and Altova SemanticWorks
(10.3%). Surprisingly, 10.3% of users make use of simple text editors, such as emacs and vi, to
create their ontologies. Other editors with some statistic expressions included OilEd (7.3%),
OntoStudio (5.5%), IsaViz (4.9%), WebODE (3.7%), OntoBuilder (3.7%), WSMO Studio (2.8%),
TopBraid Composer (1.8%), and pOWL (1.6%). Other editors that are in use include ORM and
SemTalk. A good survey of the most popular ontology editors can be found in (Escórcio and
Cardoso, 07).

Ontology Languages. Several ontology (Chandrasekaran, Josephson, et al., 1999) languages have
been developed during the last few years. In 2002, Gomez-Perez and Corcho presented a study on
Ontology Languages for the Semantic Web. The languages studied – XOL, SHOE, OML, RDF(S),
OIL, DAML+OIL – were considered the most promising back then and it was thought that they
would surely become ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web (Gomez-Perez and
Corcho, 2002). Our study revealed something somewhat different. In fact, XOL (0.9%), SHOE
(1.9%), and OML (0%) languages show extremely low adoption among ontologists. On the other
hand, the Gomez-Perez and Corcho study was correct in identifying RDF(S) and DAML+OIL as
potential languages for the semantic Web. RDF(S) and DAML+OIL have a penetration rate higher
than 64% and 12%, respectively. The language with the strongest impact in the Semantic Web is
without a doubt OWL (which is derived from DAML+OIL and builds upon the Resource

Description Framework). More than 75% of ontologists have selected this language to develop
their ontologies. Curiously, Description Logic and FLogic are also being used with a penetration
rate of 17% and 11.8%, respectively. A recent language, WSML (Web Service Modeling
Language), has also gained some popularity (3.7%). Approximately an equal numbers of
respondents use Ontolingua/KIF (2.6%), Common Logic (2.6), Semantic Net (2.2%), SHOE
(1.9%), OKBC (1.9%), and CycL (1.7%). Less popular languages include XOL, OCML, LOOM,
CanonML, Topic Maps, SKOS, and XCML.

Reasoning Engines. The use of inference engines in the Semantic Web allows applications to
inquire as to why a particular conclusion has been reached (inference engines, also called
reasoners, are software applications that derive new facts or associations from existing
information). For example, consider an ontology that describes relationships between programming
languages. Let us assume that Sara wants to search for a document in the Web about an imperative
programming language. Her enhanced browser tries to search for a Web page with the
progLangType property with the value ‘imperativeLanguage’. A particular Web site advertises its
content type as ‘Ada’. These cannot be matched as keywords or even using a thesaurus, since
‘imperativeLanguage’ and ‘Ada’ are not equal in any syntactic perspective. The programming
ontology establishes a relationship between these two concepts that makes things clearer, i.e. the
following relationship exists: Ada rdfs:SubClassOf imperativeLanguage. By using an inference
engine, Sara can successfully find a Web site that she is looking for.
We asked all respondents to indicate the reasoning engines they were using (Figure 6). The
largest segment (53.6%) indicated that they were using Jena (McBride, 2002). Smaller groups
indicated they were using Racer (28%) and Pellet (23.7%). FaCT++ (13.3%) and OWLJessKB
(8.1%) have also gained preference by a small group of participants. Finally, engines such as
OntoBroker, JTP, KAON2, TRIPLE, F-OWL, and SweetRules have a very small market share. We
should notice that 4.3% of respondents do not use any reasoning engine. Other engines, far less
popular (<0.5%), included OntoEngine, OpenCyc, OWLAPI, Sesame, SWI-Prolog, and WSMX.
