## 背景        
pg_stat_replication视图中有4个字段记录了从备库反馈的WAL位点。如下:  
```  
postgres=# \d pg_stat_replication   
          View "pg_catalog.pg_stat_replication"  
      Column      |           Type           | Modifiers   
------------------+--------------------------+-----------  
 pid              | integer                  |   
 usesysid         | oid                      |   
 usename          | name                     |   
 application_name | text                     |   
 client_addr      | inet                     |   
 client_hostname  | text                     |   
 client_port      | integer                  |   
 backend_start    | timestamp with time zone |   
 backend_xmin     | xid                      |   
 state            | text                     |   
 sent_location    | pg_lsn                   | -- 主库已经发送的截至LSN位置  
 write_location   | pg_lsn                   | -- 备库已经WRITE的LSN位置  
 flush_location   | pg_lsn                   | -- 备库已经持久化的LSN位置  
 replay_location  | pg_lsn                   | -- 备库已经APPLY的LSN位置  
 sync_priority    | integer                  |   
 sync_state       | text                     |   
```  
通过计算，我们可以得到当前备库与主库在4个维度的延迟（WAL字节数）情况。  
```  
pg_current_xlog_insert_location  --  得到当前数据库的WAL插入位点  
pg_xlog_location_diff  --  计算两个WAL LSN位点的差距  
-- SQL如下, 计算主备的发送延迟  
select pg_size_pretty(pg_xlog_location_diff(pg_current_xlog_insert_location(), sent_location)) from pg_stat_replication;  
其他维度的查询，更改sent_location即可.  
```  
使用以上方法，能查询的延迟是字节形式反馈的。  
那么如果要转换为时间形式，目前没有很好的方法，除非从WAL文件中读取对应LSN RECORD的时间信息。  
10.0将在pg_stat_replication视图中新增几个字段，用于表示时间上的延迟(write_lag, flush_lag and replay_lag)。  
```    
Replication lag tracking for walsenders  
Adds write_lag, flush_lag and replay_lag cols to pg_stat_replication.  
Implements a lag tracker module that reports the lag times based upon  
measurements of the time taken for recent WAL to be written, flushed and  
replayed and for the sender to hear about it. These times  
represent the commit lag that was (or would have been) introduced by each  
synchronous commit level, if the remote server was configured as a  
synchronous standby.  For an asynchronous standby, the replay_lag column  
approximates the delay before recent transactions became visible to queries.  
If the standby server has entirely caught up with the sending server and  
there is no more WAL activity, the most recently measured lag times will  
continue to be displayed for a short time and then show NULL.  
Physical replication lag tracking is automatic. Logical replication tracking  
is possible but is the responsibility of the logical decoding plugin.  
Tracking is a private module operating within each walsender individually,  
with values reported to shared memory. Module not used outside of walsender.  
Design and code is good enough now to commit - kudos to the author.  
In many ways a difficult topic, with important and subtle behaviour so this  
shoudl be expected to generate discussion and multiple open items: Test now!

## 原理  
![pic](20170329_01_pic_001.jpg)  
1\. 主库开辟了一块buffer，同时采样并记录主库flush wal record的LSN位置以及对应的时间。  
```  
+/* A sample associating a log position with the time it was written. */    
+typedef struct  
+{  
+   XLogRecPtr lsn;  
+   TimestampTz time;  
+} WalTimeSample;  
+  
+/* The size of our buffer of time samples. */  wal flush lsn以及对应的时间 采样  
+#define LAG_TRACKER_BUFFER_SIZE 8192  
+  
+/* A mechanism for tracking replication lag. */    
+static struct  
+{  
+   XLogRecPtr last_lsn;  
+   WalTimeSample buffer[LAG_TRACKER_BUFFER_SIZE];  
+   int write_head;  
+   int read_heads[NUM_SYNC_REP_WAIT_MODE];            --  对应备库write, flush, replay三种模式.  
+   WalTimeSample last_read[NUM_SYNC_REP_WAIT_MODE];   --    
+} LagTracker;  
/* SyncRepWaitMode */  
#define SYNC_REP_NO_WAIT                (-1)  
#define SYNC_REP_WAIT_WRITE             0  
#define SYNC_REP_WAIT_FLUSH             1  
#define SYNC_REP_WAIT_APPLY             2  
#define NUM_SYNC_REP_WAIT_MODE  3  
```  
2\. 实际上，目前记录的并不是FLUSH WAL record的LSN位置以及对应的时间，而是wal sender LSN的时间，所以目前的代码，我们应该理解为延时是从发送LSN到备库write,flush,replay三个阶段的延时。  
而不是主库FLUSH LSN到备库write,flusn,replay的延时。  
当主备WAL的发送延迟不大时，这个是比较准确的，当主备的WAL发送延迟较大时，这个就不准了。

代码如下。  
```  
    /*  
+    * Record the current system time as an approximation of the time at which  
+    * this WAL position was written for the purposes of lag tracking.  
+    *  
+    * In theory we could make XLogFlush() record a time in shmem whenever WAL  
+    * is flushed and we could get that time as well as the LSN when we call  
+    * GetFlushRecPtr() above (and likewise for the cascading standby  
+    * equivalent), but rather than putting any new code into the hot WAL path  
+    * it seems good enough to capture the time here.  We should reach this  
+    * after XLogFlush() runs WalSndWakeupProcessRequests(), and although that  
+    * may take some time, we read the WAL flush pointer and take the time  
+    * very close to together here so that we'll get a later position if it  
+    * is still moving.  
+    *  
+    * Because LagTrackerWriter ignores samples when the LSN hasn't advanced,  
+    * this gives us a cheap approximation for the WAL flush time for this  
+    * LSN.  
+    *  
+    * Note that the LSN is not necessarily the LSN for the data contained in  
+    * the present message; it's the end of the the WAL, which might be  
+    * further ahead.  All the lag tracking machinery cares about is finding  
+    * out when that arbitrary LSN is eventually reported as written, flushed  
+    * and applied, so that it can measure the elapsed time.  
+    */  
+   LagTrackerWrite(SendRqstPtr, GetCurrentTimestamp());  
+/*  
+ * Record the end of the WAL and the time it was flushed locally, so that  
+ * LagTrackerRead can compute the elapsed time (lag) when this WAL position is  
+ * eventually reported to have been written, flushed and applied by the  
+ * standby in a reply message.  
+ * Exported to allow logical decoding plugins to call this when they choose.  
+ */  
+void  
+LagTrackerWrite(XLogRecPtr lsn, TimestampTz local_flush_time)  
+{  
+   bool buffer_full;  
+   int new_write_head;  
+   int i;  
+  
+   if (!am_walsender)  
+       return;  
+  
+   /*  
+    * If the lsn hasn't advanced since last time, then do nothing.  This way  
+    * we only record a new sample when new WAL has been written.  
+    */  
+   if (LagTracker.last_lsn == lsn)  
+       return;  
+   LagTracker.last_lsn = lsn;  
+  
+   /*

+    * of the read heads, then the buffer is full.  In other words, the  
+    * slowest reader (presumably apply) is the one that controls the release  
+    * of space.

+   new_write_head = (LagTracker.write_head + 1) % LAG_TRACKER_BUFFER_SIZE;
