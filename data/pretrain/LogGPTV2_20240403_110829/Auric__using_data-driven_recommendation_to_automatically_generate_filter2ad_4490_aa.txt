ABSTRACT
Cellular service providers add carriers in the network in order
to support the increasing demand in voice and data traffic and
provide good quality of service to the users. Addition of new car-
riers requires the network operators to accurately configure their
parameters for the desired behaviors. This is a challenging prob-
lem because of the large number of parameters related to various
functions like user mobility, interference management and load bal-
ancing. Furthermore, the same parameters can have varying values
across different locations to manage user and traffic behaviors as
planned and respond appropriately to different signal propagation
patterns and interference. Manual configuration is time-consuming,
tedious and error-prone, which could result in poor quality of ser-
vice. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven recommendation
approach Auric to automatically and accurately generate config-
uration parameters for new carriers added in cellular networks.
Our approach incorporates new algorithms based on collaborative
filtering and geographical proximity to automatically determine
similarity across existing carriers. We conduct a thorough evalua-
tion using real-world LTE network data and observe a high accuracy
(96%) across a large number of carriers and configuration param-
eters. We also share experiences from our deployment and use of
Auric in production environments.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, we have seen a massive explosion in applications
relying on cellular service ranging from mission critical applica-
tions such as first responder services, medical emergencies, police
communications, to business transactions such as stock trading as
well as user entertainment such as high-definition video, online
gaming, and virtual reality. These applications have introduced
significant increase in voice, video, and data traffic to be carried
over the cellular network thereby placing tremendous requirements
on the network capacity. We have seen a rapid evolution in the
cellular service technologies from UMTS to LTE, and recently 5G.
Cellular service providers continuously add carriers (also, referred
to as radio channels) in their networks in order to keep up with the
increasing demand in traffic and provide high quality of experience
to the users.
Using real-world network data collected over three years from
a large LTE service provider in the US, we observe that there is
a tremendous increase in traffic, and numbers of carriers. Carrier
addition in the LTE network often involves physical hardware
installation to create the new radio channels and then software
configuration to integrate into the network. It is thus an expensive
process and one must carefully plan where to add new carriers
based on the capacity and coverage needs. After carriers are added
to the network, it is important to accurately configure them to effi-
ciently carry the user traffic and offer the best quality of experience
to the users. Any mis-configuration or sub-optimal configuration
increases the risk of a poor quality of experience, thereby render-
ing the carrier addition a waste of money and effort. There are on
the order of thousands of configuration parameters related to user
mobility, interference, load balancing, handovers, outage and con-
gestion management that make the configuration effort extremely
challenging. Furthermore, different geographical locations exhibit
different signal propagation patterns, and thus there is a need to
tune the configuration according to the location characteristics
(e.g., downtown area versus national park). The dependencies be-
tween the various parameters and the possible ranges within which
they can be set make the configuration management even more
challenging.
State of the art and limitations. The standard practice in cellu-
lar configuration management is the creation of the rule-books
guided by domain knowledge that define the configuration pa-
rameter values across different attributes of carriers. We define
an attribute of a carrier using its characteristics such as carrier
frequency, type, size, or downlink channel bandwidth. The rule-
books are created by the domain experts (network engineers) and
sometimes with help from radio equipment vendors. They are often

referenced to, when generating the configuration parameter values
for the newly added carrier. Capturing the domain knowledge ac-
curately and maintaining it is quite challenging, time-consuming,
tedious and sometimes error-prone. This is because of the large
number of configuration parameters, complex interactions between
parameters, impact of changes on service performance, and contin-
uous evolution of networks through software upgrades and technol-
ogy updates. Recently, automated solutions based on self organizing
networks (SON) [2, 3, 33] are being used in operational networks
to safely implement the configuration on the carriers based on the
rule-books. However, even with SON, the rule-books are created
and maintained using domain knowledge. When new carriers are
integrated, SON only ensures the configured values are compliant
with the rulebook. Further, SON is still unable to determine an
appropriate value in case a parameter has a range to choose from.
Updates can happen frequently to the rule-books, and thus manage-
ment of these rule-books and configuration parameters across the
network is a continuous process. SON also configures parameters
such as the carrier identity and immediate neighbor lists that are
specific to individual carriers and cannot be repeated anywhere in
the network. Such parameters are either designed before the launch
process or measured directly after the actual deployment, and is
outside the scope of our stated problem and solution.
The parameters that do take a wide range of values are tuned by
the network engineers differently across different locations. The
reason behind this diverse configuration setting across different
locations is to carefully account for the changing traffic distribu-
tion, user mobility patterns, signal propagation, and radio channel
conditions. This makes it quite hard to capture the values for the
configuration parameters using well-defined rules. Such parameters
are then typically configured manually by the network engineering
teams based on their operational experiences, trial-and-observe
methods, and best practices. This incurs time, cost, and effort. An
example parameter is a capacity threshold to control load balanc-
ing actions for distributing traffic across carriers. It takes values
between 0 and 100 and can be tuned differently across different
locations. This presents a unique opportunity in generating the car-
rier configuration for new carriers as they launch across different
parts of the network and is the focus of our work.
Our approach. We propose a novel data-driven approach Auric for
automatic and accurate generation of new carrier configuration pa-
rameter values using learning and recommendation techniques. In-
stead of having domain experts define and maintain the rule-books
to manage cellular network configuration, our idea in Auric is to au-
tomatically learn the rules based on existing carrier configurations
in operational networks. The intuition is carriers share similarity in
their configuration across specific locations and for matching sets
of attributes. For example, carriers serving downtown locations in
densely populated urban areas have similar configurations. Thus, if
we can identify carriers matching to the newly added one, we can
leverage the configuration from matching carriers and copy/paste
them to the new carrier. The challenge is how to systematically deal
with diverse configuration settings across different locations. We
address this by using collaborative filtering and geographical
proximity to automatically identify parameter similarity across
multiple carriers. Our idea is akin to algorithms used in popular
content recommendation system for new users [8, 25, 34, 36]. We
believe, we are the first to apply collaborative filtering based rec-
ommendation algorithms for carrier configuration generation in
cellular networks.
Our contributions.
1. We present the design and implementation of Auric using learn-
ing algorithms and geographical proximity to generate the con-
figuration for newly added carriers in cellular networks.
2. We conduct thorough evaluation using real-world configura-
tions collected from existing operational LTE cellular network
across 400K+ carriers and demonstrate that Auric achieves an
accuracy of 96%. For the 4% recommendations from Auric that
did not match the current carrier configurations, we validated
them through engineering team feedback, and identified that
28% of those mismatches turned out to be better configurations.
As an added bonus, we implemented them as configuration
changes (15K+ across multiple carriers and parameters) to align
with the engineer expectations.
3. We share our experiences from the production deployment
and use of Auric over two months in operational LTE cellular
networks to generating configurations for newly added carriers.
2 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
In this section, we first present background on LTE network, carrier
additions and managing configuration. We then present operational
practices to manage carrier configuration followed by related work.
Finally, we conduct analysis using real-world data collected from a
large operational cellular service and highlight the challenges in
accurately determining the carrier configuration.
2.1 LTE network
Fig.1 shows the basic architecture for the LTE network that con-
sists of the radio access network (RAN), and the core network. The
RAN primarily consists of base stations also referred to as enhanced
NodeB (eNodeB). The primary function of the eNodeB include radio
resource management, admission control, mobility management,
and dynamic scheduling. The core network consists of service
gateway (S-GW), packet data network gateway (P-GW), mobility
management entity (MME), policy control and charging rules func-
tion (PCRF), and home subscriber server (HSS). S-GW handles user
IP packet routing and forwarding, as well as accounting for users.
P-GW is responsible for IP address allocation for users, quality
of service enforcement and flow-based charging according to the
rules from PCRF. P-GW communicates with the Internet and voice
IMS (Internet Multimedia Subsystem) core. MME handles control
plane traffic and is responsible for signaling, user authentication
and roaming functions. HSS manages user subscription.
eNodeB has three logical interfaces. S1-U carries user plane traffic
between eNodeB and S-GW. S1-MME carries control plane traffic
between eNodeB and MME. Between two eNodeBs, the X2 interface
carries control plane traffic (for user mobility such as inter-eNodeB
handovers) as well as data plane traffic (data forwarding between
source and target eNodeB to support lossless handovers). All S1 and
X2 interfaces share the same IP-based transport network. eNodeB
typically divides the 360 degree coverage into 3 faces with each
face consisting of multiple carriers. A carrier is a radio channel on

the eNodeB used to carry the user data and signaling messages.
In LTE network, the carrier is also the center frequency of the
spectrum used to transmit the LTE signal. The users connect to
the eNodeB on specific carriers. Each of the carriers operates on
a specific frequency band (e.g., 700 MHz) and channel bandwidth
(e.g., 20 MHz). The power set, the antenna type and tilting help
define coverage area of the carrier.
Multiple carriers within the face operate on different frequency
bands - high band (HB), middle band (MB) and low band (LB).
Due to broader reach of the LB carriers and lower interference in
MB/HB, the service providers configure eNodeBs to direct the users
to connect first to high bands and after the high bands get congested
or run out of coverage, connection to the mid and low bands are
allowed. The function of managing users across frequency bands is
also referred to as carrier layer management. The service providers
add more carriers to the eNodeB to increase either the coverage or
the capacity and support growth in user traffic. It is then important
to accurately configure the newly added carriers in order to ensure
the carrier layer management functionality operates as desired.
2.2 Managing configuration
The configuration of the carriers in the LTE network can be catego-
rized into multiple functions such as radio connection management,
power control, link adaptation, scheduling, capacity management,
layer management, and user mobility management. We describe a
few configuration parameters:
1. actInterFreqLB - activates the inter-carrier frequency load
balancing (IFLB) feature. If IFLB is activated ("true"), inter-
frequency load measurements are performed by the eNodeB
per carrier. Depending on the load of the users across carriers,
the eNodeB can choose to hand over the users to under-utilized
overlapping or neighboring carrier cells on different carrier
frequencies.
2. sFreqPrio - enables comparison and prioritization between two
candidate carriers. This comparison is done using the average
load in the uplink. This parameter can help biased selection
towards a carrier by giving it a higher priority. sFreqPrio can
range between 1 and 10000. 1 (default) represents the highest
priority and 10000 represents the lowest.
3. hysA3Offset - enables selection of handover margins for better
handovers across carriers on the same frequency. It can range
between 0 and 15 in step sizes of 0.5.
4. pMax - defines the maximum output power of the carrier in
dBm. The maximum output power is the maximum value of the
linear sum of the power across all downlink resources that is
allowed to be used in a cell. The range for pMax is between 0
and 60 in step size of 0.6.
5. qrxlevmin - specifies the minimum required receive RSRP
(reference signal receive power) level in the carrier. It ranges
from -156 to -44.
6. inactivityTimer - captures the time period for the indication
of the user inactivity in both downlink and uplink directions.
The range for inactivityTimer is 1 to 65535.
There are on the order of thousands of such configuration parame-
ters across different functions. The modeling and naming conven-
tion of configuration parameters differs across different vendors
because of the lack of standardization. We formulate the configura-
tion recommendation problem independently for each vendor and
across multiple carriers in the cellular network.
