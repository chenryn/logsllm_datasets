User: Is there a way to generically retrieve process stats using Perl or Python? We could keep it Linux specific.
There are a few problems: I won't know the PID ahead of time, but I can run the process in question from the script itself. For example, I'd have no problem doing:
./myscript.pl some/process/I/want/to/get/stats/for
Basically, I'd like to, at the very least, get the memory consumption of the process, but the more information I can get the better (like run time of the process, average CPU usage of the process, etc.)
Thanks.
Assistant: If you are fork()ing the child, you will know it's PID.
From within the parent you can then parse the files in /proc/<PID/ to check the memory and CPU usage, albeit only for as long as the child process is running.
