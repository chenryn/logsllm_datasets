A.1 Path Inflation and Modulation Change
After Restoration
Fiber path length inflation. An important factor in Arrow is the
potential path inflation when the length of the surrogate restoration
fiber path (R-path) is significantly longer than the original primary
fiber path (P-path). Fig. 17 plots the CDF of the path inflation ratio
(restoration path length divided by primary path length) for Arrow
to perform optical restoration with and without frequency tuning
at Facebook. Interestingly, the figure shows that, on average, 50%
of IP links’ restoration paths are shorter than the corresponding
primary paths. This means the modulation formats of the restored
wavelengths do not need to be reconfigured, thus simplifying Ar-
row’s operations. For the remaining IP links whose restoration
paths are longer than their primary path, we plot the top 10 longest
restoration paths in Fig. 17(b) (with transponder frequency tun-
ing) and Fig. 17(c) (without transponder frequency tuning). We
observe that all restoration fiber paths are shorter than 5,000 km;
hence, they can support 100 Gbps modulation based on our device
datasheet in Table 6. Higher datarates may be possible for some
shorter paths, and restoring such highly-modulated wavelengths to
a longer restoration fiber path may trigger the change of modula-
tion formats. Prior work has demonstrated that modulation change
latency in WANs is 70 seconds using commodity hardware and can
be improved to 35 ms [77].
WAN transponders datarate vs. reach. We use the following
specifications from our optical device vendors to plan and man-
age the optical layer at Facebook. For the same wavelength slot,
higher capacity is achieved with more aggressive modulation, thus
requiring shorter transmission distance [34, 76, 77]. Note that ad-
vanced modulation techniques, e.g. probabilistic constellation shap-
ing, could even extend the optical reach with finer-granularity data
rates [24].

A.2 Routing and Wavelength Assignment
(RWA) Formulation
The RWA is a classical problem in optical networking [88]. Here,
we show the RWA formulation used in Arrow.
Separation of routing and wavelength assignment. Routing
and wavelength assignment problems can be combined into one
formulation, but Arrow separates the routing step from the wave-
length assignment step. The RWA problem is known to be compu-
tational intractable because it requires jointly optimizing a wave-
length’s routing path length and the wavelength’s frequency and
𝑒 , ..., 𝑃𝑘
modulation assignment. Arrow’s separation significantly reduces
the formulation complexity, making the problem solvable for large
topologies like Facebook within several minutes, while not compro-
mising optimality because routing paths are pre-computed respect-
ing wavelengths’ modulation format maximum transmission reach
as noted in Table 6. Note that our RWA is solved on a provisioned
brown-field (some wavelengths are already populated to carry live
traffic) optical network for restoring the failed wavelengths only,
while prior proposals are for green-field optical network planning
(the network uses dark fibers, and no wavelengths are populated).
This is another reason why our RWA can be solved within several
minutes.
Routing the restored wavelengths. Consider a fiber cut scenario
𝑞 where a set of IP links 𝐸 is lost. To restore each IP link 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸 and
revive its IP layer capacity, we run 𝑘-shortest-path algorithm [86] to
find its 𝑘 surrogate fiber paths {𝑃1
𝑒 } with path-length upper
bounds based on the modulation format of the failed IP links.10
Note that we allow multiple restored wavelengths of an IP link to be
routed over multiple surrogate restoration fiber paths because their
IP-layer bandwidth capacity can be aggregated thanks to the link
aggregation protocol (IEEE 802.3ad LACP) [44]. We then represent
the routing information using a binary parameter 𝜋𝑒,𝑘
𝜙 as 1 if a fiber
𝜙 ∈ 𝑃𝑘
Wavelength assignment of the restored wavelengths. After
obtaining the routing path for restored wavelengths, we need to
assign a frequency to each restored wavelength. Consider a fiber
𝜙 on the optical layer topology; its spectrum occupancy can be
represented by a binary vector 𝜙.𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑚 = [0, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0] (e.g.,
96 wavelength slots under ITU-T DWDM standard [38]), where 0
means this wavelength slot is already utilized by some working
wavelengths carrying live traffic, and 1 means this wavelength slot
is available for hosting the reconfigured wavelength for optical
restoration. Under one failure scenario, we define a binary variable
𝜉𝑒,𝑘
𝜙,𝑤 as 1 if the restored IP link 𝑒’s 𝑘 surrogate restoration fiber
path uses wavelength slot 𝑤 on fiber 𝜙 and 0 otherwise. We fur-
ther define an integer variable 𝜆𝑘
𝑒 that represents the number of
restored wavelengths of failed IP link 𝑒 on its 𝑘 surrogate restora-
tion fiber paths. Hence, the wavelength assignment of all restored
wavelengths for each restored IP link 𝑒 should follow the follow-
ing constraints when maximizing the total restored wavelength
𝑒 and 0 otherwise.

require shorter transmission distance [34, 76, 77].
Figure 17: Path length inflation analysis (R-path is short for restoration path, and P-path is short for primary path). 50% of IP
links’ restoration path is shorter than their primary paths. Hence, no modulation change needed. The length ratio between
restoration path and primary path has implications for both transponder modulation on the optical layer [50] and service
latency on the IP layer [69].
