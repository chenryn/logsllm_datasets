##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV 4.5.4
  * Python 3.7 (opencv installed using pip: "pip install opencv-python")
  * Ubuntu 18.04 amd64
##### Detailed description
Up to version 4.5.3 findContours returned contours as a list. Starting on
version 4.5.4 the contours are returned as a tuple. This will break codes that
try to modify the returned tuple.
##### Steps to reproduce
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(binary_image, cv2.RETR_CCOMP,
cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)  
for i in range(len(contours)):  
contours[i] = np.round(contours[i]*[1/3, -1/3]).astype(np.int32)
