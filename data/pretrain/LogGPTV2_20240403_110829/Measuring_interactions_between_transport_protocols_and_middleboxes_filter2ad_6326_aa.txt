**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the current network environment and its impact on end-to-end protocols. The traditional assumptions about the Internet are increasingly challenged by the introduction of intermediary network elements (middleboxes) that can prevent or alter the behavior of end-to-end communications. We present measurement results showing the impact of these middleboxes on various traditional and proposed protocol mechanisms, such as Path MTU Discovery and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). Using an active measurement framework, we study web servers to understand the differences between the theoretical and observed behavior of the Internet. These measurements also provide insights for defining more realistic Internet modeling scenarios.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet's architecture, protocols, and applications are constantly evolving, often leading to competing evolutions between different network entities. This competition can impact performance and robustness, and in some cases, even halt communications. For example, a study in 2000 found that attempting to negotiate the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) during TCP connection establishment caused failures with over 8% of web servers. These failures were due to firewalls configured to interpret ECN negotiation as a port-scanning tool. This example highlights the fundamental problem of different evolution paths intersecting, potentially disrupting smooth traffic flow on the Internet.

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of TCP, the most heavily used transport protocol, in the context of ongoing changes to the Internet's basic architecture. Specifically, we examine how "middleboxes" (e.g., firewalls, NATs, proxies) impact TCP and other end-to-end protocols. Our goal is to elucidate unexpected interactions between layers and ways in which the real-world Internet differs from its textbook description. The measurements presented in this paper also serve as lessons for efforts to further evolve end-to-end protocols and the Internet architecture.

We use active measurements to assess the capabilities supported by web servers and their behavior in the current Internet environment. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work on measurement studies of transport protocols. Section 3 details the tools and methodology used in our study. Section 4 explores interactions between middleboxes and transport protocols. Section 5 discusses additional results. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and discusses open questions and future work.

## 2. Related Work
This paper builds on and extends the methodology from [23] using the TCP Behavior Inference Tool (TBIT). TBIT, the measurement tool used in our work, follows a history of active probing of TCP. For instance, [8] treats TCP implementations as black boxes, observing their reactions to external stimuli to assess adherence to specifications.

There is also significant work on passive tests of TCP based on packet trace analysis. [24] outlines tcpanaly, a tool for analyzing TCP implementation behavior by inspecting sender and receiver packet traces. [25] provides observed packet dynamics based on tcpanaly's analysis. [3] assesses web client properties using packet traces of TCP connections to a specific web server.

Additionally, there is research on the effect of middleboxes on transport protocol performance (e.g., [4]). However, we focus specifically on interactions between middleboxes and transport protocols, rather than general architectural evaluations of middleboxes or their effects on DNS, BGP, etc.

Finally, there is extensive literature on active and passive approaches for estimating end-to-end network path properties using TCP. In this paper, we do not discuss TCP-based tests for estimating path properties such as loss rates, available or bottleneck bandwidth, and congestion durations. Similarly, we do not cover passive measurements of traffic on a particular link to determine round-trip times, application layer protocols, transfer sizes, etc.

## 3. Measurements: Tools and Data
We employ active measurements in this study using the TBIT tool [23]. TBIT probes web servers for their characteristics in the context of the network environment. While some information can be gathered passively, many TBIT tests require active insertion of packets, such as testing for middleboxes that block TCP SYN segments carrying ECN advertisements.

The measurements were conducted between February and May 2004. The TBIT client was run from a machine on our local network, with no local firewall between the TBIT machine and the Internet.

The target web servers were gathered from IRcaches, the NLANR Web Caching project [1]. We used cache logs from nine locations across the United States, containing 84,394 unique IP addresses. Most of these addresses (82.6%) are from North America, with smaller percentages from Europe (10.2%), Asia (4.9%), Oceania (1.1%), South America (1.0%), and Africa (0.2%).

## 4. Middleboxes and Transport Protocols
The increased prevalence of middleboxes challenges the end-to-end principle, introducing dependencies and hidden points of failure. Middleboxes that divert or modify IP packets violate the assumption that packets flow unchanged from source to destination, affecting transport and application protocols in unpredictable ways. This section explores how middleboxes can interfere with transport protocol performance.

### 4.1 ECN-capable Connections
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [27] allows routers to mark packets to indicate congestion instead of dropping them. After the initial deployment of ECN-capable TCP, reports emerged of middleboxes (e.g., firewalls and load-balancers) blocking TCP SYN packets attempting to negotiate ECN capability. This section examines the impact of such middleboxes on ECN-capable connections.

### Table 2: ECN Status and Number of Servers (2000)
| Year: 2000 | ECN Status                | Number of Servers |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
|            | I. ClassiÔ¨Åed Servers      |                   |
|            | I.A. Not ECN-capable      | 24030             |
|            | I.B. ECN-Capable          | 21879             |
|            | I.B.1. no ECN-Echo        | 21602             |
|            | I.B.2. ECN-Echo           | 277               |
|            | I.C. Bad SYN/ACK          | 255               |
|            | II. Errors                |                   |
|            | II.A. No Connection       | 2151              |
|            | II.A.1. only with ECN     | 2151              |
|            | II.A.2. without ECN       | 2151              |
|            | II.B. HTTP Error          | 0                 |
|            | II.C. No Data Received    | -                 |
|            | II.D. Others              | -                 |

This table shows the classification of servers based on their ECN status in 2000. The majority of servers were not ECN-capable, and those that were capable often did not support ECN-Echo. The presence of middleboxes that block ECN negotiations is evident from the number of connection errors reported.
