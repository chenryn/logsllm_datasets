User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题DHCP issue with Cumulus and ESXi So my switch has Cumulus Linux running on it and I have ESXi running in my network.

So my main network is on 172.22.0.0/24 which has my my esxi.
The networks I want esxi vms to run on is 172.22.20.0/24 172.22.10.0/24.
So the .20 serves dhcp fine and I have no issues with it. The issue comes with the .10 and I am not sure why its failing since I have the same configurations for .20. 

This is what I get from syslog when I run it on the switch and try to connect a vm on the network to it.

Mar 11 08:14:08 cumulus dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:50:56:80:4d:b8 
(gitlabs) via vlan10-InfaNet
Mar 11 08:14:08 cumulus dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 172.22.10.100 to 00:50:56:80:4d:b8 (gitlabs) via vlan10-InfaNet
Mar 11 08:14:08 cumulus dhcpd: send_packet: No such device


When I run a dhcpdump i get this

sudo dhcpdump -i vlan10-InfaNet
Ignored non IPv4 packet: 2048
Ignored non IPv4 packet: 2048


On every DHCP offer the get the ignored non ipv4 thing and I am not sure why. When I statically assign an ip to a vm it works fine so I don't think it networking configurations but I might be wrong.

/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

INTERFACES="br-main vlan20-VMNet vlan10-InfaNet"


/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

# vlan 20 VMNet
subnet 172.22.20.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  option routers 172.22.20.254;
  option broadcast-address 172.22.20.255;

  pool {
    range 172.22.20.100 172.22.20.200;
    allow unknown clients;
  }
}

# vlan 10 VMNet
subnet 172.22.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  option routers 172.22.10.254;
  option broadcast-address 172.22.10.255;

  pool {
    range 172.22.10.100 172.22.10.200;
    allow unknown clients;
  }
}


Do you have any clue?

Assistant: Each VLAN is a separate network. In order to service DHCP clients in both networks the DHCP server either needs an interface in each of those networks or you need to use a DHCP relay agent in the network where the DHCP server doesn't have an interface so that the DHCP relay agent can forward DHCP broadcasts to the DHCP server.
