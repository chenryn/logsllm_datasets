Subject: Issue with Global Shortcut Key Mapping

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring an issue to your attention regarding a global action that I have mapped to the shortcut `Alt+Shift+C`.

The problem is that the action is also triggered when I press `Alt+Shift+Control+C`, which is unintended. I would like to ensure that the action is only executed when `Alt+Shift+C` is pressed, and not when `Control` is included in the key combination.

Could you please look into this and provide a solution or guidance on how to resolve it?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Martin
