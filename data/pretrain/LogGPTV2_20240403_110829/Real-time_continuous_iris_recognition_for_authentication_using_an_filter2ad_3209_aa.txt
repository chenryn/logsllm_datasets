ABSTRACT 
today’s  authentication  systems, 
The  majority  of 
including 
password  and  fingerprint  scanners,  are  based  on  one-time,  static 
authentication  methods.  A  continuous,  real-time  authentication 
system  opens  up  the  possibility  for  greater  security,  but  such  a 
system  must  be  unobtrusive  and  secure.  In  this  work  we  studied 
whether  a  commercial  eye  tracker  can  be  used  for  unobtrusive, 
continuous, real-time user authentication via iris recognition. In a 
user  study,  all  37  participants  could  be  authenticated  with  11% 
equal error rate (EER). For 14 of the 37 users, iris occlusion was 
sufficiently  small  to  authenticate  with  9%  EER.  When  classified 
using  a  k-nearest  neighbors  algorithm  and  only  the  right  iris,  the 
same  data  set  allowed  100%  accuracy  for  k  =  3.  Although  these 
error rates are too high for standalone use, iris recognition via an 
eye  tracker  might  enable  real-time  continuous  authentication 
when  combined  with  other  more  reliable  authentication  means 
(e.g.,  a  password). As eye trackers become widely available their 
capabilities  for  multiple  factor,  continuous  authentication  will 
become compelling.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
There  is  considerable  interest  in  biometrics-based  authentication 
because of several compelling advantages. Biometrics can provide 
sufficient  information  entropy  for  good  security.  In  particular, 
human  iris  patterns  are  unique  even  for  identical  twins  [1]. 
Because  biometric  traits  are  part  of  the  user’s  body,  they  are  not 
typically  lost  or  forgotten,  although  they  can  be  stolen  or 
duplicated  [2].  Finally,  biometrics,  particularly  those  that  are 
related to subconscious physical functions of the human body may

even  have  the  ability  to  support  continuous  authentication  [3]. 
This is because such biometrics can be sampled automatically and 
unobtrusively by the authentication system, as they do not require 
a deliberate action on behalf of the user. 
Recent  advances  in  the  capabilities  of  commercial  remote  eye 
tracking devices and decreases in their cost may lead to their use 
for  user-friendly,  secure,  continuous  biometric  authentication.  If 
they  become  widely  available,  it  would  be  natural  to  attempt  to 
use  eye  trackers  for  authentication  purposes.  Eye  trackers  could 
support  multi-factor  biometrics,  combining  iris  recognition  with 
the biometrics of eye gaze movement, and possibly even with the 
traditional  password  [4].    By  using  a  combination  of  biometrics, 
such  as  gaze  tracking  and  iris  recognition,  eye  trackers  may  be 
able to prevent the fake iris attack [2].  
2.  EYE TRACKING FOR USER 
AUTHENTICATION 
Continuous  authentication  via  iris  recognition  using  eye  trackers 
is a topic at the intersection of three fields that have had relatively 
little overlap.  
Continuous  authentication  is  a relatively new concept. Keystroke 
dynamics,  first  proposed  by  Spillane  [5],  was  the  first  technique 
that  could  be  used  for  continuous  authentication  [6].  More 
recently,  research  on  continuous  authentication  is  based  on 
multiple  biometric  factors  in  addition  to  keyboard  dynamics, 
including:  mouse  dynamics  [7],  ECG  data  [3],  posture  and  chair 
dynamics  [8],  face  recognition  [9]  and  even  garment  recognition 
[10].  All  of  these  techniques  have  relatively  large  error  rates.  A 
survey  of  keyboard  dynamics  found  that  even  the  best  machine 
learning  algorithms  could  only  achieve  around  9%  equal  error 
rates  [11].  As  such,  they  are  not  candidates  for  standalone 
authentication  but  are  intended  for  use  in  combination  with  a 
more accurate and established means of authentication [12]. 
The second field, iris recognition, has had a much longer history. 
Discriminating  between  individuals  based  on  differences  in  iris 
patterns  was  first  proposed  in  1936,  but  the  procedure  was 
patented  only  in  1987.  Dr.  John  Daugman  played  a  key  role  in 
developing an algorithm for iris recognition, resulting in a patent 
in 1994. The IrisCodes algorithm he developed is still widely used 
today for iris recognition. Iris recognition is fairly mature, and it is 
among  the  strongest  biometric  authentication  technologies  with 
false positive rates around a few in a billion [1].  
1007Thirdly,  eye  tracking  technologies  were  first  developed  in  the 
1970’s, but only became mainstream around the year 2000 [13].  
Although  iris  recognition  using  an  eye  tracker  may  seem  as  a 
natural  extension  of  the  camera  functionality  in  the  device,  the 
feasibility  of  such  a  use  has  not  been  demonstrated  yet.  This  is 
due  to  several  practical  limitations  of  eye  trackers  as  iris 
recognition  devices.  Not  surprisingly,  eye  trackers  are  optimized 
for  eye  tracking,  and  the  iris  images  they  acquire  are  not  well 
suited  for  iris  recognition.  Specifically,  eye  trackers  have  a 
relatively  wide  field  of  view  to  allow  continued  tracking  even 
when the user moves his or her head. This leads to iris images that 
are  small  and  provide  lower  resolution  than  iris  images  from  an 
iris  scanner,  in  which  the  iris  fills  most  of  the  field  of  view. 
Moreover,  the  eye  tracker  must  be  able  to  handle  fast  motions, 
blinks, and other actions that reduce image quality.   
Despite  these  challenges  in  acquiring  quality  iris  data,  using  an 
eye  tracker  for  iris  recognition  is  less  intrusive  for  the  user  than 
using an iris recognition camera, and, as shown below, it works.  
3.  METHODOLOGY 
The device we used is an EyeTech TM3 eye tracker [14]. The eye 
tracker  camera  can  capture 
images  with  960x1280  pixel 
resolution, but for efficiency, it only returns the image area around 
the  eyes,  a  420x1280  pixels  box  where  the  iris  radius  is  40-60 
pixels, depending on the user’s anatomy and distance from the eye 
tracker. A sample image is included in Figure 1. Most, but not all 
eye  tracking  manufacturers  make  available  the  eye image, but all 
use infrared cameras which capture similar images.  
Figure  1.  Eye  tracker  image  showing  two  glint  spots  in 
each eye a) entire image b) magnified iris image. 
The  eye  tracker  uses  two  infrared  LEDs  operating  at  an  880  nm 
wavelength  to  generate  two  bright-point  reflections  (glint  spots) 
on  the  surface  of  the  eye.  The  eye  tracker  returns  several 
parameters along with the eye image: pupil position and diameter, 
as well as glint positions (two glint points per eye). 
We  used  existing  software  for  iris  recognition  [15].  The  original 
software, intended for high-resolution images with 160-300 pixels 
for  the  iris  diameter, took 15-30 minutes per iris. Using the 2-4x 
lower  resolution  images  from  the  eye  tracker  achieves  a  speedup 
of  about  4-16x.  A  further  source  of  speedup  is  from  the  way  we 
locate  the  iris  and  pupil  using  the  glint  spots.  Finally,  instead  of 
accurately detecting the iris boundary, we used an iris annulus of 
fixed  width,  which  requires  minimal  image  processing,  but 
includes  the  distinctive  zigzag  collarette  region  of  the  iris  [16]. 
The  source  code  is otherwise unmodified. Overall, these changes 
allowed  us  to  reduce  the  processing  time  to  about  2  seconds  per 
sample, which allows near real-time iris recognition.  
The  iris  comparison  is  based  on  Daugman’s  algorithm  [1].  To 
compare  two  irises,  the  algorithm  computes  iris  templates, 
masking  out  areas  that  do  not  contain  valid  iris  data  (glare, 
eyelids, eyelashes etc.) and then performs a bitwise comparison of 
the  unmasked 
the  Hamming 
distance.  A  distance  of  0  indicates  a  perfect  match,  while  a 
distance  of  0.5  indicates  a  totally  random  matching  of  bits.  A 
distance of 1 corresponds to one iris being a negative image of the 
template  regions,  calculating 
other.  To  decide  whether  two  irises  match,  we  use  a  threshold 
distance: samples with distance below threshold are deemed from 
the  same  user,  while  samples  with  distances  exceeding  the 
threshold are assumed to be from different users.  
There are three parameters to be determined in the iris recognition 
model:  the  Hamming  threshold  and  the  angular  and  radial
