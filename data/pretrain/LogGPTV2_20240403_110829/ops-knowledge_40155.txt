  /usr/bin/python
  ```

#### Import Error
```bash
$ python

>>> import dns
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named dns
```

#### Additional Information
- A firewall is installed on the new machine, but it has been disabled and the issue persists.

### Solution

#### Step 1: Verify Installation
Ensure that `dnspython` is installed correctly and the `dns` directory is present in the Python site-packages directory.

1. **Navigate to the `dnspython` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/dnspython
   ```

2. **Copy the `dns` directory:**
   ```bash
   cp -r dns /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   $ python
   >>> import dns
   >>> print(dns.__file__)
   ```

#### Step 2: Reinstall `dnspython`
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try reinstalling `dnspython` directly into the site-packages directory.

1. **Navigate to the site-packages directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
   ```

2. **Install `dnspython` using `pip`:**
   ```bash
   sudo pip install dnspython
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   $ python
   >>> import dns
   >>> print(dns.__file__)
   ```

#### Step 3: Check for Multiple Python Versions
Ensure that there are no multiple Python versions causing conflicts. You can check the Python path and verify the correct version is being used.

1. **Check the Python path:**
   ```bash
   $ python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
   ```

2. **Ensure the correct Python version is being used:**
   ```bash
   $ which python
   /usr/bin/python
   ```

#### Step 4: Firewall and Network Issues
Although you mentioned disabling the firewall, ensure that there are no other network restrictions or proxy settings that might be affecting the installation.

1. **Check for any network-related issues:**
   ```bash
   $ ping google.com
   ```

2. **Check for proxy settings:**
   ```bash
   $ env | grep -i proxy
   ```

### Conclusion
By following the above steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the `dnspython` module. If the problem persists, please provide additional details about your environment and any error messages encountered during the process.
