User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL Server Backup problem when browsing to the directory I want to allow a group (eg. 'BackupManagers') who can only preform backup and restore operations on certain databases. When creating the BackupManagers user account I checked db_backupoperator.

When the user logs in to create a backup they get an error message similar to the following when the select Tasks -> Backup -> Click on Add in the destiantion block -> click on the "..." button to browse


  TITLE: Locate Database Files - MYSERVER\SQL2005
  E:\MSSQL\Backup Cannot access the
  specified path or file on the server.
  Verify that you have the necessary
  security privileges and that the path
  or file exists.
  
  If you know that the service account
  can access a specific file, type in
  the full path for the file in the File
  Name control in the Locate dialog box.


I have confirmed that the user has permissions to the folder. I have even created a share to this folder and had them access it through explorer. They are able to create and delete files within the folder.

I have found that if they type in the path to the file instead of using the "..." button to browse the directory tree then they can create a backup file fine.

Why is the browse button not working as expected?

Thanks!

Assistant: Does the "BackupManagers" group have any sort of permissions on the E: drive and E:\MSSQL folder?  If not, they may require "traverse" permissions on those folders, or you could give the group "Bypass traverse checking" rights in Windows.  The latter setting is done through group or local policies in the User Rights Assignment.
