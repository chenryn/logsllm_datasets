mapping the original R-score of each call to its degraded R(cid:173)
score, as shown in Fig. 11. Generally speaking, calls with a
high R-score incur more quality degradation than those with
a low R-score. We observe that the adaptive buffer scheme
causes more degradation than the static buffer scheme for
calls with an original R-score higher than 40. The reason
is that a call with an initial high R-score is associated with
short network delays;
in this case, the adaptive buffer size
tends to be decided by the spiky relay processing delays. On
the other hand, the static buffer scheme is not susceptive to
delay variations, so the quality degradation remains relatively
constant.
4) Summary: Here, we formally define that a call is "de(cid:173)
graded" if it experiences an R-score decrease greater than
10 points. Among the simulated calls, we find that the static
buffer scheme causes 31% of the calls to be degraded, while
the adaptive buffer scheme causes 54% to be degraded. In
addition, for the two schemes, the average degradation time
ratio within a call is 10% and 18% respectively.
C. Impact of Busy Levels
Having evaluated the overall VoIP quality degradation
caused by relay processing delays, we now examine the
relationship between workload levels and the degree of voice
quality degradation. Recall that we defined the busy level to
quantify the workload at a relay node in Section V-B. For each
call, we first divide the busy levels and R-score decreases into
10 groups by their ranks. Then, we plot the average R-score
decreases for a variety of busy levels, as shown in Fig. 12.
The figure clearly shows that higher busy levels lead to more
serious quality degradation. On average, the R-score decreases
are higher than 10 points when the busy level of the relay
node is higher than 20 ms. This result implies that we should
avoid a relay node with a busy level higher than 20 ms, as
transmitting VoIP packets through this node would lead to
significant quality degradation.
D. Busy Period Characterization
Based on the analysis results, we define that a relay node is
busy when its busy level is higher than 20 ms. In our traces,
23% of relay nodes were even in a busy state during a 10(cid:173)
minute call. We also define a busy period of a relay node as
a continuous time span during which the node is busy.

the busy periods in each call and plot
To understand the patterns of busy periods on relay nodes,
we extract all
the
distributions of their length and interarrival times in Fig. 13.
We find that a busy period lasts for 18 seconds on average,
where 65% of busy periods are shorter than 10 seconds. Also,
the interarrival time of busy periods is 25 seconds on average.
These statistics suggest that the busy status of relay nodes is
quite unstable because the nodes tend to switch between busy
and non-busy states frequently.
VII. CONCLUSION
it could be also detrimental
In this paper, we consider a hidden aspect of peer-to(cid:173)
peer relaying-the processing delays at relay nodes. Existing
related works mostly focus on how to improve current peer(cid:173)
to-peer systems by data relaying, but seldom discuss its
adverse effects. Through the trace collection in Section IV, the
statistical analysis in Section V, and the network simulations
in Section VI, we show that relaying is a double-edged sword
in that
to VoIP quality if an
inappropriate relay node is used. The degradation cannot be
avoided completely as a lightly-loaded relay node may start
running a load-intensive application at anytime. Thus, we have
to monitor the processing delays of a relay node continuously,
as we usually do for network conditions,
the
application performance from being degraded. We hope this
study will motivate future peer-to-peer systems to focus on this
negative aspect of the application-layer relaying technique.
