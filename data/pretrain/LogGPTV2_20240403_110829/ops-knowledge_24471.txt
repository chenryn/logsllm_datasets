User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where is log output from cloud-init stored? Where does output from cloud-init (automatically runs scripts when starting up a virtual machine in the cloud, for example at Amazon EC2) go? I would like to know that my initialization scripts executed successfully.

There is a /var/log/cloud-init.log file, but it seems to contain only partial output (namely from the SSH key initialization).

Assistant: Since cloud-init 0.7.5 (released on Apr 1 2014), all output from cloud-init is captured by default to /var/log/cloud-init-output.log. This default logging configuration was added in a commit from Jan 14 2014:

# this tells cloud-init to redirect its stdout and stderr to
# 'tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' so the user can see output
# there without needing to look on the console.
output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}


To add support for previous versions of cloud-init, you can manually add this configuration manually to your Cloud Config Data.
