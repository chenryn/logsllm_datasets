ABSTRACT
Wearable devices, such as smartwatches, are furnished with
state-of-the-art sensors that enable a range of context-aware
applications. However, malicious applications can misuse
these sensors, if access is left unaudited. In this paper, we
demonstrate how applications that have access to motion or
inertial sensor data on a modern smartwatch can recover
text typed on an external QWERTY keyboard. Due to
the distinct nature of the perceptible motion sensor data,
earlier research eﬀorts on emanation based keystroke infer-
ence attacks are not readily applicable in this scenario. The
proposed novel attack framework characterizes wrist move-
ments (captured by the inertial sensors of the smartwatch
worn on the wrist) observed during typing, based on the
relative physical position of keys and the direction of tran-
sition between pairs of keys. Eavesdropped keystroke char-
acteristics are then matched to candidate words in a dictio-
nary. Multiple evaluations show that our keystroke infer-
ence framework has an alarmingly high classiﬁcation accu-
racy and word recovery rate. With the information recov-
ered from the wrist movements perceptible by a smartwatch,
we exemplify the risks associated with unaudited access to
seemingly innocuous sensors (e.g., accelerometers and gyro-
scopes) of wearable devices. As part of our eﬀorts towards
preventing such side-channel attacks, we also develop and
evaluate a novel context-aware protection framework which
can be used to automatically disable (or downgrade) access
to motion sensors, whenever typing activity is detected.

INTRODUCTION
Technologies that fueled the rapid growth of modern elec-
tronic computers are also catalyzing development in wear-
able computing. Most modern wearable devices, such as
smartwatches, are capable of a range of context-aware ap-
plications, including personal assistance, health and well-
ness monitoring, personal safety, and corporate solutions,
to name a few. Behind the scenes, a wide range of highly
precise sensors provide the contextual information required
by these applications to provide a seamless and personalized
user experience.
Unfortunately, applications with malicious intents can also
covertly use these sensors to collect private information,
without user-consent. Many of the side-channel attacks im-
plemented for smartphones can be readily applied to smart-
watches. For example, a malicious application with appro-
priate hardware support can stealthily capture photos or
video of the user and their surroundings with camera[11],
record ambient sounds with microphone [21], and track and
predict location activities using GPS [18]. As modern smart-
phone operating systems recognized open access to these
sensors as apparent privacy risk, applications’ permission to
access these sensors were made user-manageable. Addition-
ally, use or access to certain sensors also include explicit
user-notiﬁcations, for example, a notiﬁcation icon appears
on Android and iOS when the GPS sensor is being accessed
by an application. Yet, malicious applications found novel
side-channel attacks to infer private information through in-
direct means. For example, gyroscope, a sensor usually used
to detect changes in device orientation, can potentially be
used to detect and recover audio speeches [17]. Another
example of a distressing side-channel attack is inferring key-
strokes using emanations captured by motion sensors such
as accelerometer and gyroscope [16, 19].
Although many of the side-channel attacks designed for
smartphones are not directly applicable in wearable devices
such as smartwatches, we anticipate that innovative attacks
can hugely beneﬁt by the way these wearable devices are
used. In practice, smartphone usage is highly intermittent
(for example, it has been shown that on an average a smart-
phone is used only 58 minutes per day [2]), and these de-
vices spend a majority of their time in a constrained (e.g., in
users’ pockets) or in an activity-less (e.g., on a table) setting
where most on-board sensors are partially (or completely)
non-functional, thereby limiting the inferential capabilities
of malicious applications that attempt to take advantage of
data from these sensors. On the contrary, wearable device
usage is much more persistent as they are always carried by
users on their body in the same natural position as their
traditional counterparts and users are much more naturally
habituated to these devices. Our hypothesis is that, as wear-
able smart devices are persistently and uniquely used, sen-
sors on them are able to capture a continuous stream of user-
speciﬁc contextual data, access to which if not controlled
appropriately, can be potentially exploited by malicious ap-
plications to infer sensitive user information.
In this paper, we show that unaudited access to motion
sensors featured on most smartwatches can inadvertently
lead to signiﬁcant leakage of information relating to users
and their surrounding. We demonstrate that a malicious ap-
plication, with access to motion sensor readings of a smart-
watch, can decode the keystrokes made on a QWERTY
keyboard while wearing the smartwatch on one hand. We
achieve this based on the observed relative physical position
of keystrokes and direction of transition between pairs of
keystrokes. We then recover the typed words by mapping
the captured ‘motion’ of each word to pre-formed motion
proﬁles of words in an English language dictionary. Due to
the distinctive nature of perceptible sensor data on smart-
watches, straightforward adaptation of earlier side-channel
keystrokes attacks based on emanation of electromagnetic,
acoustic or vibration pulses generated by a keystroke, is not
beﬁtting. A comprehensive empirical evaluation of our key-
stroke inference framework show signiﬁcantly high word re-
covery rates.
As evident from our experimental results, the threat to
privacy posed by side-channel attacks using wearable de-
vices is substantial. However, there have been very limited
eﬀorts from the research community to eﬀectively defend
against such side-channel attacks in a user-friendly fashion.
We propose and implement a new context-aware protection
framework which can automatically activate various protec-
tion mechanisms whenever typing activity is detected. We
also empirically evaluate the protection framework in real-
life usage scenario.
2. RELATED WORK
Emanation based side-channel inference attacks date back
to the World War II era [12]. The primary types of ema-
nations include electromagnetic signals, sounds, and vibra-
tions. Previous studies demonstrated the use of electro-
magnetic emanation to eavesdrop on contents displayed on
a CRT or LCD screen [24, 14] from a distance and with
opaque obstacles in between. Similar attacks using electro-
magnetic emanations have also been shown to work against
CPU chips [3], smart cards [20], data carrying cables [22],
and keyboards (wired or wireless) [25]. Optical emanation,
contained in the band of electromagnetic spectrum percep-
tible to human eyes, present a diﬀerent form of leakage for
display devices. The light released from display devices may
reﬂect oﬀ various surfaces in front of the screen, and reach
an eavesdropper. Successful reconstruction of the displayed
information has been demonstrated based on reﬂection such
as from walls [13], shiny objects [7], and even from viewer’s
eyes [5]. While electromagnetic emanation based attacks are
certainly eﬀective, the need of specialized equipment and it’s
concealed placement near to the target poses diﬃculty. Sim-
ilarly for side-channel attacks based on optical emanations,
the eavesdropping equipment must be placed in line of sight
of the target.
Side-channel attacks based on acoustic or sound emana-
tions are much more feasible because of the popularity of
personal devices featuring microphones. Microphones are
inexpensive, and can be easily concealed because of their
compact form factor. Furthermore, if a target’s microphone
enabled device (such as smartphones, tablets, etc.) is hi-
jacked, it can act as a disguised eavesdropping equipment.
As much as 90% of English text printed by a dot-matrix
printer can be successfully recovered, by learning the acous-
tic emanations released by the printer [6]. The other major
use of acoustic emanation has been in keystroke inference
attacks, which targets to recover key presses on a nearby
computer keyboard [4, 9]. Similar keystroke inference at-
tacks can be carried out using surface vibration emanation
generated during keystrokes [16, 8]. Vibrations of nearby
surfaces caused by human voice can also be recorded, and
used to decode speeches [17]. While systems to record vi-
brations may be diﬃcult to conceal, Marquardt et al.
[16]
proposed the use of a smartphone’s accelerometer to record
vibrations near keyboards. If an adversary is able to infect
their target’s smartphone with a malicious application which
can record and transmit sensor data stealthily, it can serve
as a very eﬀective eavesdropping tool.
However, a critical requirement of learning based side-
channel attacks using electromagnetic, acoustic, or vibration
emanation, is that the target and eavesdropping equipment
must not be disturbed. Change in either’s position or orien-
tation will render the training data futile, thereby making
recovery of target information impossible. This also means
that training must be performed in the same setting as the
attack, which may not always be feasible. For example, in
case of [16], if the target person puts his/her smartphone
one day on the left side of the keyboard and another day on
the right side, the vibrations captured by the accelerome-
ter will be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, resulting in failed recovery
of typed text. Our attack setting, which uses motion data
from a wearable device to infer keystrokes, is largely unaf-
fected due to similar constraints as most people wear and use
these devices in a very standard fashion (for example, smart-
watches are almost always worn on the left wrist by most
people). Moreover, our attack mechanism and wrist motion
characterization framework is very general and can be easily
extended to work in scenarios comprising of non-traditional
usage of these wearable devices (for example, users wearing
the watch on the right hand instead).
During the ﬁnal phase of completing this work, we came
across recently published works which demonstrate the abil-
ity to infer keystrokes using smartwatch. Maiti et al.
[15]
used machine learning to train classiﬁers based on the slight
diﬀerences in wrist movements observed while tapping nu-
meric keys on a handheld smartphone keypad, depending on
the location of the key on the screen. The trained classiﬁers
are then used on test data to perform multiclass classiﬁca-
tion between the ten keys. Similar to our work, Wang et al.
[26] demonstrate the feasibility of keystroke inference attack
using a smartwatch, on a QWERTY keyboard. However,
their attack framework is very diﬀerent from ours. We also
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our attack framework
and preliminary results indicate that our approach leads to
better inference accuracy compared to [26]. However, [26]
has a diﬀerent experimental setup, due to which we are un-
able to make a comprehensive comparison like we do with
[16] and [9].
Interestingly, none of the recent works on side-channel
keystroke inference attacks propose or implement a practi-
cal protection mechanism. Some of the previous work using
smartphone sensors as side-channels, brieﬂy suggest oper-
ating system developers to provide users with ﬁne-grained
control over application’s permissions to every sensors [10].
But without knowing which application is malicious, the
user may have to toggle sensor access back and forth for
all the installed applications. Other research eﬀorts vaguely
suggest to restrict the precision at which applications are al-
lowed to access the sensors [19, 17, 15]. However, regulating
sensor precision will result in poor application performance,
for example, gaming applications will have slow controls and
response, mapping applications will be delayed/inaccurate,
etc. Moreover, some sensors (such as camera and micro-
phone) will be rendered unusable at very low sampling rates.
In the more recent work using smartwatches as a side-channel
[26], Wang et al.
completely overlooked the necessity of
having protection mechanisms. In this paper, we not only
demonstrate the feasibility of keystroke inference attacks
using smartwatches as a side-channel, but we also design,
