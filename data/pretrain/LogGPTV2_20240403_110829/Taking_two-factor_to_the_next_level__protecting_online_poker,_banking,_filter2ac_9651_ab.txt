This  solution  can  be  added  to  existing  online  poker  sites 
incrementally. Poker players can configure their account to use a 
smartphone for their hole cards, or to play the old fashioned way, 
and  a  poker  table  can  consist  of  some  players  who  are  using 
smartphones  for  their  hole  cards  and  others  who  are  just  using 
their computers. Figure 1 illustrates the concept  
4.1  Multi-tabling 
The  smartphone  app  described  above  supports  multi-tabling, 
where a user plays on multiple poker tables at once. One way to 
do  this  is  to  have  the  poker  client  on  the  computer  inform  the 
smartphone about which table has the current focus. For example, 
say that a user has 6 simultaneous poker tables running, and that 
the displays for those tables are stacked. So, the smartphone app 
has  6  hands  to  display,  and  those  hands  are  linked  to  the 
corresponding tables on the user’s computer. When it is a user’s 
turn to act at one of the tables, that table’s image pops up to the 
front of the screen on top of all the other tables. At the same time, 
the computer can communicate, either through the game server, or 
even over a direct WiFi or Bluetooth connection, a table or hand 
identifier to the smartphone, which can then automatically display 
the  corresponding  hole  cards.  The  user  can  also  scroll  manually 
through the active hands by swiping on the smartphone screen and 
rotating through the active hands. 
One way to help the user link the hands on the smartphone to the 
tables  on  the  computer  is  to  use  visual  cues,  such  as  matching 
screen  skins.  For  example,  each  table  can  have  a  corresponding 
background color and outline design that matches an outline color 
and design on the corresponding hand on the smartphone. 
Another  way  to  display  the  hole  cards  on  the  smartphone  is  to 
show small images of all of the hole cards for all the active hands. 
Depending  on  the  screen  size  and  resolution  and  the  number  of 
active tables, this option may be viable. It works even better if the 
player uses a tablet instead of a smartphone. Here is an example 
of what a smartphone display can look like with multiple tables:

5.  ONLINE BANKING APPLICATION 
The main idea described in this paper is to protect a user’s online 
activities from malware on his or her computer by splitting an 
application into two components. One of the components runs on 
a user’s computer, and the other runs on a smartphone, over an 
independent network channel. This can be applied to online 
banking and many other online applications that involve sensitive 
information that could be compromised by malware on the user’s 
machine. 
An online banking application can be designed such that the user 
utilizes his computer and his smartphone such that if an attacker 
compromises either one of them, but not both, there is no risk to 
the user. For example, the application can be split so that the user 
logs into the account form the computer, and selects a bill 
payment. The split application then requires the user to use his 
smartphone to indicate the target of the bill payment, as well as 
the amount. Next, in this example, the user then completes the 
transaction on the computer.  
The banking application described here differs from traditional 
two-factor authentication in that the application is split in an 
application-specific way. That is, the splitting of the application 
into two parts includes knowledge and understanding of what 
occurs inside of an online banking transaction. By contrast, 
traditional two-factor authentication typically involves sending a 
text message to a cell phone to authenticate a user, regardless of 
the specific application that requires the authentication. 
An illustration of this process for a transfer transaction is shown 
in Figure 2. 
Other applications that can be split in this manner include stock 
purchasing, access to sensitive medical records, online shopping, 
and  any  other  application  involving  financial  or  otherwise 
sensitive information. 
6.  RETROFITTING A SOLUTION 
This  paper  describes  a  way  to  split  applications  such  as  online 
poker and online banking such that portions of the application run 
on  one  device,  such  as  a  computer  and  other  security-sensitive 
portions  of  the  application  run  on  another  device,  such  as  a 
smartphone. Let’s take the case of online poker to examine how 
such a solution might be adopted. 
One way to adopt this solution is for the online poker sites to re-
implement  their  software  such  that  users  can  register  a  second 
device,  and  the  hole  cards  can  be  sent  directly  to  that  device. 
However,  the  online  sites  may  decide  that  implementing  such  a 
solution is not worth it to them. In that case, a third party could 
implement a trusted proxy. The proxy would behave as though it 
were a poker client when interacting with the gaming server, and 
it would impersonate the gaming server to poker clients. In fact, 
the gaming site could implement the solution themselves as such a 
proxy to avoid rewriting their code. 
The proxy could then handle the distribution of the hole cards to 
the smartphone, while preventing the sending of the hole cards to 
the  user’s  computer.  One  challenge  of  this  approach  is  that  the 
proxy would most likely have to implement a man in the middle 
on an SSL connection. This is not a problem if the game server 
themselves wants to implement the proxy, but it would present a 
challenge for a third party proxy. 
7.  RESEARCH PROBLEMS 
The concept of using two devices to perform application-specific 
splitting  of  an  online  service  is  relatively  straightforward. 
However,  actually  implementing  an  application-specific  split 
introduces several research problems.  
For example, say that an online banking application is written in 
JAVA.  Is  there  a  way  to  describe,  in  some  computer-readable 
way, the functionality that needs to be split, and to identify in a 
computer-understandable way, which items are security sensitive, 
and  then  to  have  a  program  automatically  generate  the  code  for 
the split application from the original program? Perhaps this could 
be achieved if the original program were annotated or designed in 
some  way  to  allow  for  later  splitting.  So,  the  first  question  is 
whether there is a way to build applications such that it is easier to 
split  them  later.  Furthermore,  is  there  a  way  to  automate  the 
splitting of the code? 
If  the  program  can  be  split  using  source  code,  then  a  harder 
problem is to take the binaries for a program such as the server-
side  application  and  the  client-side  app  and  to  use  them  to 
generate three new binaries with portions that run on the server, 
the client, and a new client, the user’s smartphone. 
Solving these research problems may be too difficult to achieve in 
the general sense, but it would be interesting to explore how far 
one could get with automated techniques for splitting client-server 
applications into client-client-server applications with the security 
properties described in this paper. 
8.  CONCLUSIONS 
This  paper  addresses 
in  online 
applications,  and  proposes  a  solution,  which  is  an  evolutionary 
step  from  the  currently  known  two-factor  authentication.  We 
describe a simple solution to protect online poker hands, whereby 
a smartphone with an independent communication channel to the 
poker server is used to display the secret hole cards. This avoids 
the problem of malware on computers compromising the secrecy 
of user’s cards and significantly raises the bar for an attacker. The 
solution is easy to implement and can be added incrementally to 
existing online poker servers. The technique can also be applied to 
online banking and other security-sensitive applications.
