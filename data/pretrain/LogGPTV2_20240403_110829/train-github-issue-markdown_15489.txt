 **Keith Donald** opened **SPR-9051** and commented
When a `@ContextConfiguration` test class references a config class missing a
`@Configuration` annotation, `@Bean` dependencies are wired successfully but
the bean lifecycle is not applied (no init methods are invoked, for example).
Adding the missing `@Configuration` annotation solves the problem, however the
problem and solution isn't obvious since wiring/injection appeared to work.
It would be better if an integration test failed-fast if you reference a
config class with no `@Configuration` annotation.
