User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Permission denied (publickey) - mac I can't log into my droplet. This is another post I made about the issue that did not solve my problem, but explains some of what I have tried.

What I just tried:


ssh-key gen. Naming the keys portfolio. Could this naming be a problem? The only keys that work on my machine are the keys with the default name id_rsa, but there cannot be more than one set with that name.
There is a line in the debug that says Offering public key: RSA SHA256:blahblah /Users/ME/.ssh/id_rsa so it looks like it connecting to the wrong key???
I have tried ssh -i ~/.ssh/portfolio ME@139.xx.xx.xxx to connect to a specific private key called portfolio. Nope. Permission denied (publickey).
Log into server inside DO console. nano /.ssh/authorized_keys. Copy in my public key called portfolio. Got this here
Create a new user and save.
Test the key pair from terminal on my mac with ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/portfolio newUSer@139.XX.XXX.XXX


Big fat Permission denied (publickey). Obviously logging in does not work either. Why? The keys match and are in place yet still do not find each other.

Further debugging: Using the digital ocean console, currently the only way I can access my droplet, I see that copy/paste does not work. Pasting in a public key results in a string of totally different characters than the real key. This even happens in nano.

Assistant: I wanted to update how I solved this. The problem was that:


The key was not making it to the server correctly. Or an incorrect version was making it. 
Once I got the correct keys placed, my local machine and the server were not finding the correct keys to match each other.


Solved 1. - ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey root@MY-IP for trying to copy the public key did not work. I also tried pasting it directly into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in the Digital Ocean console since I was locked out locally, but many of the pasted characters were wrong. Something was screwey about the pasting function there and Digital Ocean staff didn't know anything about that.

So to work locally I reset root PW on DO console then ssh myUser@123.456.789.10 on my local machine but with a password. Then in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys I pasted in the public key and used a diff tool to make sure they were the same. This time there were.

Solved 2. - The keys still were not connecting. I could connect using only using -i flag (which means identity _file and connects the keys manually)  ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey myUser@123.456.789.10 but I didn't want to type type this every time so I make a ~/.ssh/config.

Host myapp
    User user1
    HostName 123.456.789.10
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey


Then, going ssh myappp I am able to login. Not sure why all these things are occurring. I thought maybe since I did not name them properly since id_rsa works okay, but id_rsa2 does not so not sure what would work then, but these workarounds solved this issue.
