reasonable performance even in crowded spaces.
In order to study these worst-case scenarios for SDDR,
we estimate the reduction in battery life assuming that
there are 255 new device responses for every inquiry scan
we perform. We use three components of energy con-
sumption for our estimate: idle with Bluetooth running in
discoverable mode (EBT ), epoch changes (EEC), and dis-
coveries (ED). Each of these components represents the
amount of energy consumed in mJ over the course of a
full day (24 hours), and together represent the aggregate
energy consumption while running the SDDR protocol:
ESDDR(d,i) =E BT (d,i) +E EC + ED(d,i)
(1)
EBT (d,i) and ED(d,i) vary with respect to the number
of nearby devices (d), and the discovery interval in sec-
onds (i). We measured the average energy consumption
for cases of 1, 3, and 5 discovering devices, for discovery
intervals of 60 and 120 seconds. Additionally, we use the
results of the microbenchmarks from Table 2 to provide
formulas for the energy consumed by epoch changes and

running the SDDR protocol, for varying numbers of
nearby devices.
discoveries. We assume a linear model, with respect to
the number of nearby devices (d), for each i (either 60
or 120 seconds) in computing the formulas for EBT (d,i)
and ED(d,i). The energy consumed by epoch changes
(EEC) does not vary with respect to d or i.
We validate Equation 1 by comparing its results to the
measured values from Table 3. Without any nearby de-
vices, our estimates are off by 1.96% and 0.66% for 60
and 120 second discovery intervals respectively. Like-
wise for the case of 5 devices, our estimates deviate from
the measurement results by 4.61% and 1.74%.
The estimated daily battery life consumption for vary-
ing numbers of nearby devices is shown in Figure 4.
Over the course of an entire day, running the SDDR
protocol with a 120 second discovery interval consumes
27.82% battery life in this worst-case scenario.
Comparison with SmokeScreen We compare the per-
formance of our protocol with SmokeScreen’s discovery
protocol [27]. SmokeScreen requires sending one clique
signal per advertised ID, and does not use a set-digest
data structure (e.g. Bloom ﬁlter) to aggregate them. In
the authors’ implementation, the clique signals are sent
over a Bluetooth name request, which holds 248 bytes of
data, i.e., roughly 4 clique signals. This makes Smoke-
Screen less scalable with larger advertised sets: 1) for
more than 4 advertised IDs, the clique signals have to
be sent over multiple Bluetooth name requests (increas-
ing the discovery latency), and 2) sending multiple name
requests for large advertised sets also lead to additional
energy consumption. SDDR requires a constant amount
of time to detect linkability to a given false positive rate,
while SmokeScreen’s detection time increases linearly
with respect to the number of clique signals.
Since the SmokeScreen measurements were reported
several years back, we re-evaluated the energy consump-
tion for SmokeScreen on a recent device. In our measure-
ment, we conservatively estimate the energy consump-

tion for SmokeScreen, by measuring only communica-
tion related, but not computation- or storage-related en-
ergy overhead. Our results suggest that in the case of
one nearby device, SmokeScreen’s communication con-
sumes 1,628mJ of energy; for three devices, this in-
creases to 2,071mJ. Unfortunately, the cost of perform-
ing a name request for each individual nearby device is
prohibitively expensive. For the same amount of energy
spent by SmokeScreen with 3 nearby devices, SDDR
can discover and process 35 nearby devices (from Equa-
tion 1).
7 Discussion
In this section, we discuss properties and implications of
the somewhat unique communication model provided by
SDDR, which departs from the norm in two basic ways:
• SDDR decouples conﬁdentiality from identity: en-
counter peers can communicate securely, even
though they do not know each other, and cannot rec-
ognize each other during future encounters.
• Communication within SDDR is both deﬁned and
limited by radio range, which may not necessarily
conform to application semantics.
7.1 Conﬁdentiality without Identity
SDDR’s secure encounter primitive provides, in effect,
a per-encounter mutual pseudonym for the encounter
peers, and an associated shared key. It enables the peers
to name each other and communicate securely during
their encounter, and at any time after their encounter via
an untrusted rendez-vous service. The peers can name
and authenticate each other as participants in a speciﬁc
encounter and communicate securely, while remaining
anonymous and unlinkable otherwise (assuming they do
not reveal linkable information within their communi-
cation).
Interestingly, if the users choose, this type of
anonymous interaction during an encounter can form the
basis for mutual identiﬁcation and authentication.
Prior systems rely on anonymous or unlinkable en-
counters between peers, such as SMILE [43] which sup-
ports ﬁnding missed connections, and SmokeScreen [27]
which allows two anonymous peers to exchange ad-
dresses for further communication (e.g., E-mail ad-
dresses) through the use of a trusted third party service.
7.2 Radio-Range Limited Communication
SDDR communication is limited to radio range, nom-
inally 10 meters for Bluetooth 2.1 (50 meters for the
latest Bluetooth 4.0 standard). From an application de-
sign point-of-view, range-limited communication may
inhibit, but can also prove useful.
Without a third-party data repository or additional pro-
tocol mechanisms, e.g., a multi-hop structure, applica-
tions that provide notiﬁcations among devices beyond ra-
dio range cannot be implemented. For example, SDDR
cannot be used to replicate the functionality of Google
Latitude, which provides updates on friend locations in-
dependent of physical distance.
Yet another problem may be that the radio range is
not limiting enough! For instance, consider an applica-
tion that wants to create pairwise encounters and share
a group secret only between users who are in the same
room. Nothing within SDDR will prevent messages
from being received outside the room, enabling a passive
eavesdropper to learn the group secret. External mecha-
nisms, in case of the room limited communication, pos-
sibly a fast attenuating ultrasound identiﬁcation beacon
are required to manage the impedance mismatch between
application semantics and radio range.
In general, ap-
plication designers may choose to use SDDR for a base
level of peer detection, and impose criteria that ﬁlters un-
wanted peers.
However, we note that radio range limited communi-
cation can have beneﬁcial effects as well. In many situa-
tions, the Bluetooth radio range includes the attendees of
a socially meaningful event—those with whom a user is
likely to interact or share an experience.
Finally, the conﬁdentiality and anonymity provided by
SDDR may disproportionately empower abusive users,
who could, e.g., spam or otherwise abuse those who are
nearby. Here, radio range limited communication pro-
vides both a bound on abusive communication and a
rudimentary form of accountability.
If SDDR is used
for malice, the victim is assured that the source of the
communication is nearby. The victim could move, or
provide evidence of misbehavior (received messages) to
law-enforcement authorities. The physical proximity (ei-
ther of the sender or an accomplice) required for commu-
nication within SDDR can potentially serve as a deterrent
to abusive communication.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we articulate the need for efﬁcient secure
mobile encounters and their requirements, including se-
lective linkability and efﬁcient revocation. We propose
a light-weight protocol called SDDR, which provably
meets the security requirements under the random oracle
model, and enables highly scalable and energy-efﬁcient
implementations using Bluetooth. Experimental results
show that our protocol outperforms standard Private Set
Intersection by four orders of magnitude. Additionally,
its energy efﬁciency exceeds that of SmokeScreen by an
order of magnitude, while supporting stronger guaran-
tees. Energy consumption (and the resulting battery life)
