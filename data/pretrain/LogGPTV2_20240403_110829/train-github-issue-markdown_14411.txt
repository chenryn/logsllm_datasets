Search for contacts saved on Outlook (365 not outlook.com)
I have over 2,000 contacts in Outlook and it's very frustrating to find a
contact’s phone number. On the Mac, you simply spotlight, type the name of the
person and you have their phone number.
I want to invoke PowerToys Run, type a name and get their phone number. Not
sure why this is so hard. Kind of funny that the fastest way I have for
getting a contact from Microsoft Exchange is to use my iPhone…
