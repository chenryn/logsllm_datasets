using 1.2.4
I created a pod with a small udp echo server running on port 5005
(mendhak/udp-listener) and exposed it as a udp service.
**This only happens when the client and server land on the same node!**
A simple client
    nc -4u -w1 $SERVICE_IP 5005  10.228.1.3.5005: UDP, length 7
    08:00:38.574447 IP 10.228.1.5.38130 > 10.228.1.3.5005: UDP, length 7
    08:00:42.022864 IP 10.228.1.5.42386 > 10.228.1.3.5005: UDP, length 7
By the way, my real use case was using logstash with a udp input and my logs
were duplicated sometimes (when the pod that produces logs landed on the same
node as logstash).
another thought, maybe TCP packets get duplicated too but handled?
