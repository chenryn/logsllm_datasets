tent Resiliency Service
It is possible that the recovery of failed content servers
takes more than one time slots and content servers do not
only fail dynamically but also come back to service dy-
namically. The conﬁguration problem under such dynamic
conditions becomes more complex — the conﬁguration of
replication locations might need to be dynamically adjusted
and this incurs additional reconﬁguration cost. A cost-
effective conﬁguration strategy should therefore consider
both the static prevention cost and the reconﬁguration cost,
importantly, from a long-term perspective instead of a short-
term point of view.
5.1 Problem Formulation
When a content server in the content resiliency service
network fails, we assume it will be repaired and come
back to service with a probability of Prev during each time
slot after its failure. Note that although content servers
could fail both independently and correlatively, we assume
their revivals are independent; intuitively, the revivals of
nodes usually involve various stages (e.g., repairing hard-
ware, powering up, restarting operating system, restarting
softwares) and therefore tend to be independent from each
other.
Reconﬁguration Cost The reconﬁguration cost is the pro-
tocol cost of changing replication conﬁgurations, e.g., set-
ting up and tearing down the backup relationships between
content servers.
In this paper, we estimate the reconﬁg-

uration cost with the number of backup relationships that
need to be changed during a reconﬁguration. Formally, as-
sume the old backup set for a content server is Sold and
the new backup set after reconﬁguration is Snew, we esti-
mate the reconﬁguration cost with the following equation:
R(Sold, Snew) = |Sold ∪ Snew − Sold ∩ Snew|. We also as-
sume for simplicity that all reconﬁgurations are conducted
at the end of time slots.
Overall Cost In a system that runs L time slots, the overall
prevention cost associated with a local content server NA
includes two types of cost:
the static prevention cost in-
curred in each time slot for replicating the data it received
from local users, and the reconﬁguration cost incurred dur-
ing each reconﬁguration of its backup set. Formally, the
overall cost is
L(cid:5)
T (NA) =
[C(NA, St
A) + β · R(St−1
A , St
A)]
(1)
t=1
where St
A is the backup set of node NA at the beginning of
A = φ. The weighting factor β
time slot t for t > 0 and S0
is used to reﬂect how the actual protocol cost of setting up
or tearing down one backup relationship is weighted against
the static prevention cost numerically. Its value is speciﬁc
to the actual method of conducting the reconﬁguration.
The goal of prevention cost minimization in dynamic
environments is therefore to ﬁnd a reconﬁguration pol-
icy that helps to decide the sequence of backup sets
A} such that the long-term average of the
{S1
overall prevention cost (i.e., lim inf L→∞ T (NA)) is mini-
mized and meanwhile the availability A(NA∪ St
A) is main-
tained over the lower bound Al for any time t.

5.2 Dynamic Reconﬁguration Policies
A straightforward reconﬁguration policy is to always re-
compute and reconﬁgure to the statically optimal backup set
at the end of each time slot based on current system condi-
tion, i.e., the failed/alive state of the content servers. We
refer to this policy as the Eager-Change Policy(ECP).
The ECP policy aggressively adapts to system condi-
tions and therefore can minimize the total communication
cost. But its aggressiveness also potentially incurs a large
amount of reconﬁguration cost. Fig. 6 shows the reconﬁg-
uration cost associated with a content server during each of
100 time slots when the ECP policy is adopted. The bars
below the x-axis represent the reconﬁgurations that happen
when the availability of an old backup set drops below Al;
this happens when one more nodes in the old backup set
fail during the time slot. The bars above the x-axis represent
the reconﬁgurations that happen when the availability of old
backup set is still above Al; the reconﬁgurations are trig-
gered because one or more previously failed content servers
revive from failure and make better options of backup set
available.
For systems where the reconﬁguration cost is lightly
weighted (i.e.,the weighting factor β in Eq. 1 is small), ECP
is a good policy due to its effectiveness in reducing the to-
tal communication cost. However, for systems where the
value of β is large, the reduction in communication cost can
not be justiﬁed by the increase in reconﬁguration cost and
a less aggressive policy is more favorable. In the remain-
der of this section, we discuss an Incremental Adjustment
With Thresholds Policy(IATP), which allows us to tune the
aggressiveness of system and make tradeoffs between the
reconﬁguration cost and the communication cost based on
different value of β.
As the name suggests, the IATP policy is incremental
and threshold-based.
It works as follows. At the end of
each time slot t, the system checks the current backup set
St
A for each content server NA. There are three cases.
Case 1 No content server in St
A has failed in the time slot
and no content server outside St
A has revived from previous
failure either. That is, the system conditions did not change
during the time slot. In this case, there is no need to adjust
the backup set and therefore St+1
Case 2 One or more content servers in St

survived content servers in St
A have failed in
In such case, the system checks the set of
A, and evalu-

ate the availability of A(NA ∪ ˆSt
A). If the availability stays
above Al, the system keeps ˆSt
A as the the new backup set for
A = ˆSt
the next time slot, i.e., St+1
A. Otherwise, the system
needs to compute a new backup set to bring the availabil-
ity back above Al. Instead of being totally memoryless, the
computation of the new backup set is incremental; it is done
by only adding nodes to ˆSt
A. Both the branch-and-bound
and the heuristic algorithms described in Section 4 can pro-
vide this adding-only feature by setting the initial backup
A ∪ {NA}. The details have been discussed in
