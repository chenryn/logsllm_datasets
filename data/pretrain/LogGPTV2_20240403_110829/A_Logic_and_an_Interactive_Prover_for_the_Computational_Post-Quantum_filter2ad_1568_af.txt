Required effort: In total, modeling the protocols took in the
order of hours, and constructing their proofs in interaction with
PQ-SQUIRREL took in the order of weeks. PQ-SQUIRREL
veriﬁes each resulting proof ﬁle in under 10 seconds on a
laptop with a quad-core CPU at 1,8GHz.
As a side contribution, we also developed new generic tactics
for the prover that enabled the case studies. We ﬁrst present
case studies in Sections V-C and V-D, and then introduce the
new tactics in Section V-E.
C. Key exchange case studies: IKE and KEM-based
1) Threat model and security properties: We modeled ﬁve
key exchange protocols, for which we proved, e.g.:
• Authentication - if a party accepts, another accepts (with
the same parameters).
• Strong Secrecy - the keys derived by the parties are
indistinguishable from fresh random values.
In these initial case studies, we consider the same threat
model for all key exchange protocols: an arbitrary number
of initiators and responders willing to answer to anybody,
including to dishonest/compromised identities with attacker-
controlled keys. We did not yet prove properties with respect to
dynamic corruptions nor more complex security properties like
perfect forward secrecy, and we consider them out of scope
for this work. We stress however that in a similar fashion
to EASYCRYPT and CRYPTOVERIF, PQ-SQUIRREL does not
have any hard-coded threat model, and these case studies can
be extended in future work.
2) IKE case studies: The IKE standards, version 1 [41] and
2 [41], specify suites of key exchanges. They are Difﬁe-Hellman
key exchanges that support multiple authentication modes.
RFC 8784 [34] addresses the issue of quantum computers
breaking the DDH assumption, and its authors claim that the
authentication mode based on a pre-shared key in version 1
(IKEV1PSK) is post-quantum sound. For the same purpose, they
also deﬁne a way to extend version 2 so that the ﬁnal key
computation depends on a pre-shared key.
For IKEV1PSK, we use PQ-SQUIRREL to prove that a
pre-shared key between two entities allows to derive an
authenticated secret key indistinguishable from a random.
We also analyze the version 2 protocol with signatures for
the authentication and extended with the pre-shared key, which
we call IKEV2SIGN
PSK is simpler than
IKEV1PSK, because the signatures simplify the derivation of
the authentication property.

3) KEM based key exchanges: KEMs are currently con-
sidered as a possible replacement for DH-like key exchanges.
KEMs abstract mechanisms that generate and send fresh key
material encrypted to another party, from which both parties
derive a fresh shared key. Some generic constructions of KEM
based key exchanges have been proposed in [18], [35], and have
for instance been expanded into a full alternative to TLS in [54]
or as post-quantum sound variants of the Signal X3DH hand-
shake [38]. These key exchanges were speciﬁcally designed to
not rely on any DH-like operations, and their security instead
relies on assumptions on the corresponding KEM constructions,
i.e., IND-CCA.
In PQ-SQUIRREL, we generally model KEM-based key
exchanges by modeling some common internals of KEMs:
generating fresh key material, sending this encrypted to the
other party, and then deriving a key from this material at both
parties using a key derivation function.
The basic KEM-based key exchange pattern is to perform the
KEM operation at both parties with respect to their peer’s long-
term public keys, and then to xor the two resulting fresh keys
(one for each direction). This generic pattern was illustrated
in our example from Fig. 4. As the knowledge of both fresh
keys is needed to derive the ﬁnal key, the attacker cannot
obtain it unless it knows both long-term private keys. Note that
such schemes provide implicit authentication, but not (explicit)
authentication: only a trusted party can derive the ﬁnal key,
but there is no guarantee that such a party exists.
In our speciﬁcation, we use enc to talk about an abstract
KEM construction, while in practice, it is referred to as
the encapsulation mechanism, and the decryption is the
decapsulation. Presenting it using an encryption symbol directly
allows to model it inside PQ-SQUIRREL, but this does not
affect the validity of the proofs.
For all our KEM based case studies, our models include an
unbounded number of initiators with distinct secret decapsula-
tion keys skI, each willing to initiate an unbounded number
of sessions with any honest responder with encapsulation key
pkR, as well as an unbounded number of honest responders

PQ-SQUIRREL CASE STUDIES: WE CONSTRUCTED NEW MODELS OF KEY EXCHANGE PROTOCOLS WITH STATIC KEY COMPROMISE, AND REVISITED
PREVIOUS SQUIRREL PROTOCOL MODELS. PQ-SQUIRREL PROVES THAT THESE PROTOCOLS ARE COMPUTATIONALLY POST-QUANTUM SECURE WHEN THEY
ARE IMPLEMENTED WITH POST-QUANTUM SECURE PRIMITIVES FOR EACH OF THEIR ASSUMPTIONS.

willing to engage with an unbounded number of sessions with
any arbitrary public key that may be attacker-controlled.
Recall that a generic KEM based construction does not
provide explicit authentication properties; thus, for KEM based
key exchange we only prove the strong secrecy of the derived
keys. In our basic example of Fig. 4, this would be achieved
in three steps, ﬁrst by using IND-CCA to hide the secret
ephemeral keys kI and kR from the attacker; second by using
the PRF assumption to derive valid keys, i.e., showing that
kdf(ex) is indistinguishable from a fresh random nx; third
by using the OTP assumptions that enforces the one-time
pad property, and thus that the ﬁnal key is indistinguishable
from random, as it is always equal to nx ⊕ t for some t and
fresh random bitstring nx. For illustration purposes, the actual
PQ-SQUIRREL proof corresponding to this example can be
found along with the other case studies at [2]. Interestingly,
the proofs carried out in PQ-SQUIRREL follow this high-level
structure for the multiple KEM based case studies, and were
thus straightforward to establish.
4) Concrete case studies: The KEBCGNP protocol closely
follows the generic pattern. KEFSXY uses an additional
ephemeral key used for each session, as well as an additional
round of PRF application to the key materials before xor-ing
them. We prove the strong secrecy of the derived keys for both
protocols.
The SC-AKE protocol, intended as a possible post-quantum
replacement of Signal’s X3DH, can be seen as a variant
of KEFSXY extended with a third message send from the
Responder to the Initiator, containing a signature to provide a
form of deniable authentication. Instead of deriving a single key
k := kdf(sid, ei) ⊕ kdf(sid, er), it derives two keys ks and
kf using kdf1 and kdf2. The ﬁrst one is used to xor, and thus
hide, the signature of the sid sent for authentication, and the
second one is the derived key. Because of these constructions
and their properties, SC-AKE is our most complex case
study. The proof ﬁrst requires proving the authentication
of the responder to the initiator, by relying on the EUF-CMA
assumption on the signature. After having shown that the
material used by the initiator to derive the secret key is from
an honest source, we can show that the secret key is strongly
secret by following the previous pattern. Such proofs illustrate
a strength of the PQ-SQUIRREL prover: it allows interactions
between a part of the logic dedicated to proving reachability
properties (e.g. authentication), and then use those properties
inside indistinguishability proofs (e.g. secrecy).
D. Proving post-quantum soundness of SQUIRREL case studies
We used PQ-SQUIRREL to verify the proofs of the nine
previous SQUIRREL case studies. Out of those, PQ-SQUIRREL
was able to prove that six were post-quantum sound, and three
were not, as they relied on the DDH assumption.
Thus, it seems that most existing proofs in SQUIRREL are
already post-quantum sound, even though we know it is possible
to prove statements in SQUIRREL that are not post-quantum
sound. This appears to be because the proofs of realistic
protocols rely on an induction on the length of the trace. We
then reason on frames of protocols and prove that each of their
possible last messages does not break the indistinguishability.
This pattern seems to avoid violating the balance condition.
E. Additional tactics
1) A Non-Malleability tactic: SQUIRREL already had a tactic
for the IND-CCA axiom, which is the one usually used for
KEM. However, the IND-CCA axiom is not only used to
provide secrecy in the context of KEM, but also a form of weak
authentication. If a party receives the ciphertext of something
that corresponds to an honest ephemeral share, then there exists
a session of an honest initiator that sent it. To prove such
an authentication property, the IND-CCA axiom is ill-suited,

because we rely on the non-malleability property of the scheme,
which is implied by IND-CCA [11], [50]. We developed a
new tactic that allows to say that encrypted honest secret share
cannot have been tampered with by the attacker, and must have
been sent by some honest party. In [1], we provide the formal
deﬁnition of the meta-logic rule, as well as its soundness proof
from the original IND-CCA BC axiom. Using this tactic, we
could directly prove the weak authentication of the schemes.
Inside SQUIRREL proofs, we often
2) Global
tactics:
consider statements of the form
frame@pre(τ ), t frame@pre(τ ), t(cid:48)
We then show that t and t(cid:48) are indistinguishable while
leaving the frame abstract. Most SQUIRREL tactics only allow
manipulating the terms appearing inside t and t(cid:48). However, we
sometimes need to perform actions globally: not only on t and
t(cid:48) but also on the terms that may appear inside frame@pre(τ ),
i.e., all the terms inside the protocol. We implemented four
new tactics that enable such global manipulations:
• a tactic to globally substitute a name by a fresh name;
• a tactic that allows to prove the indistinguishability of
two protocols by proving their functional equivalence, i.e.,
that they in fact produce exactly the same distributions
with overwhelming probability;
• an IND-CCA2 tactic to replace all occurrences of some
cipher by a version with perfectly hidden plaintext; and
• a PRF tactic to replace all occurrences of the hash of a
given message by the same random.
In comparison, the original SQUIRREL tactic for PRF only
allows to replace one instance of a hash inside t by a random
as long as one can prove this hash was never computed before
by the protocol.
We provide the formal deﬁnitions as well as proof of
soundness for the tactics in [1].
VI. CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
A. Minimality of the syntactic conditions
Each of the three syntactic conditions is needed to forbid
unsound operations over quantum attackers, as illustrated
by the three examples in Section III. However, they may
not be the minimal possible conditions, and our conditions
do reduce expressivity. Notably, our current restrictions rule
out zero knowledge proofs, whose security analysis often
requires rewinding. However, our current assessment is that any
weakening of the conditions would inherently be very domain
speciﬁc, and thus only useful for a small set of protocols.
For instance, while we could have loosened the consistency
condition to allow for some particular form of post-quantum
sound rewinding [58], [60], all such techniques are dedicated to
particular cases. We currently believe it would be very difﬁcult
to derive a general post-quantum rewinding technique (see
e.g. [4]).
B. Scope of the tool
In terms of security properties, we have already used
PQ-SQUIRREL to verify a range of properties like unlinkability,
anonymity, strong secrecy, and authentication. In general, it
allows expressing properties using arbitrary ﬁrst-order logic
formula, which can mix indistinguishability properties and
reachability properties, and can thus be used to express all
classical security properties.
For protocols, PQ-SQUIRREL cannot currently carry out
