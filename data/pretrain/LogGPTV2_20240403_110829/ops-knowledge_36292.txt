Question: "An attacker is attempting to perform a return-to-libc attack on an iOS application to execute malicious code. Which iOS security features are designed to mitigate this type of attack, and how do they function to prevent the attacker's success?"
 "A": "FairPlay Code Encryption decrypts code only on devices associated with the attacker's account, limiting the attack surface."
 "B": "ASLR randomizes the memory location of program files and libraries, making it difficult for the attacker to predict specific memory addresses."
 "C": "The XN mechanism marks certain memory segments as non-executable, preventing execution of injected machine code."
 "D": "Sandboxing restricts app processes to their own directories, which allows execution of unauthorized dynamic code."
Answer: BC
