### Hibernation Data and Windows Resume Process

Upon initiating the hibernation resume process, the system transfers execution to the Windows Resume boot application (Winresume.efi). The entry point routine, `HbMain`, reinitializes the boot library and performs several checks on the hibernation file:

- **Architecture Verification**: Ensures the hibernation file was created by the same processor architecture.
- **Page File Validation**: Confirms the existence of a valid page file with the correct size.
- **Hardware Configuration Changes**: Checks for any reported hardware configuration changes via the FADT and FACS ACPI tables.
- **File Integrity Check**: Verifies the integrity of the hibernation file.

If any of these checks fail, `Winresume` terminates the execution and returns control to the Boot Manager, which discards the hibernation file and initiates a standard cold boot. If all checks pass, `Winresume` reads the hibernation file using the UEFI boot library, restores the saved physical pages, rebuilds the necessary page tables and memory data structures, and copies the required information to the OS context. Finally, it transfers execution to the Windows kernel, restoring the original CPU context. The kernel resumes from the power manager's sleeper thread, reenables interrupts, thaws other system CPUs, updates the system time, rebases system timers, and sends an `IRP_MN_SET_POWER` request to each system driver to restart their devices. The prefetcher is then restarted, and the system becomes fully functional, entering the S0 (fully on) power state.

### Fast Startup and Hybrid Shutdown

Fast Startup is a technology that leverages hibernation. When an application passes the `EWX_HYBRID_SHUTDOWN` flag to the `ExitWindowsEx` API or a user clicks the Shutdown button, and if the system supports the S4 (hibernation) power state and has a hibernation file enabled, a hybrid shutdown is initiated. After `Csrss` switches off all interactive session processes, session 0 services, and COM servers, `Winlogon` detects the Hybrid flag and follows a different path. It uses the `NtPowerInformation` system API to switch off the monitor, informs `LogonUI` about the hybrid shutdown, and calls `NtInitializePowerAction` to initiate system hibernation. The subsequent procedure mirrors the standard hibernation process.

#### Experiment: Understanding Hybrid Shutdown

To observe the effects of a hybrid shutdown, you can manually mount the BCD store after the system has been switched off, using an external OS. Ensure Fast Startup is enabled in the Control Panel under Power Options. Before shutting down, insert a DVD or USB flash drive with a live Linux OS. Boot from the external drive, access the BIOS interface, and mount the main UEFI system partition. Copy the `BCD` file from `\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD` to an external drive. Restart your PC and wait for Windows to resume from hibernation. Use the Registry Editor to load the `BCD` hive and check for the `resume` and `hiberboot` BCD elements, which should have their `Element` registry value set to 1.

### Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)

WinRE provides tools and automated repair technologies for common startup issues, including:

- **System Restore**: Restores to a previous restore point.
- **System Image Recovery**: Restores a complete backup.
- **Startup Repair**: Detects and fixes common startup problems.
- **PC Reset**: Removes non-essential applications and drivers, restoring default settings.
- **Command Prompt**: Allows manual troubleshooting.
- **Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool**: Tests for faulty RAM.

Access WinRE by pressing Shift while rebooting from the Start menu, or using the F8 key during Bootmgr execution. If the system fails to boot, Bootmgr automatically starts WinRE, launching the Startup Repair tool.

### Safe Mode

Safe mode is a minimal boot configuration that loads only essential drivers and services to avoid crashes. Access safe mode through WinRE, the F8 key, or the Advanced Boot Options menu. Variations include:

- **Safe mode**: Minimal drivers and services.
- **Safe mode with networking**: Adds network drivers.
- **Safe mode with command prompt**: Uses `Cmd.exe` as the shell.
- **Directory Services Restore mode**: Boots with Active Directory offline for repairs.

### Driver Loading in Safe Mode

Windows determines which drivers and services to load in safe mode using the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot` registry key. This key contains subkeys for `Minimal` and `Network` modes, specifying drivers and services. The `ServiceGroupOrder` key defines the order in which driver groups load. During a safe-mode boot, `Winload` passes a switch to the kernel, which sets the `InitSafeBootMode` variable and records the boot parameters in the registry. The I/O manager and Plug and Play manager use this information to load the appropriate drivers.

### Safe-Mode-Aware User Programs

The Service Control Manager (SCM) and `Userinit` check the `OptionValue` and `UseAlternateShell` registry values to determine the boot mode and load the appropriate services and shells. Applications can use the `GetSystemMetrics(SM_CLEANBOOT)` function to detect safe mode, and batch scripts can check the `SAFEBOOT_OPTION` environment variable.

### Boot Status File

The `Bootstat.dat` file records the system's progress through various life cycle stages, including boot, shutdown, and resume. It helps the Boot Manager, Windows loader, and Startup Repair tool detect and address abnormal shutdowns. This binary file is managed by private interfaces in `Ntdll.dll` and cannot be edited by users.

### Conclusion

This chapter covered the detailed steps involved in starting and shutting down Windows, including normal and error scenarios. We explored new security technologies and core system mechanisms that ensure the system's stability and security throughout its lifecycle.
