`@types/enzyme` pulls `@types/cheerio` that pulls `@types/node` using triple
slash notation that is not compatible with web platform and can't be disabled
using `types` property in `tsconfig.json` causing react tests using enzyme to
fail due to TS issues caused by incompatibility of `setTimeout()`,
`setInterval()` etc signatures between web and node platform.
This is regression introduced in this commit:
`602e045`#diff-b6bce2a5160083400070377ac11edbb8
The workaround is to lock dependency on version `@types/PI:EMAIL`.
