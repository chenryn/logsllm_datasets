User: Hi folks so I got the following problem,
I have the following code in a batch file:
 ..\python-2.7.10.amd64\python.exe ./bin/bla.py ./conf/config.conf > ./logs/output.txt 
This works like a charme by double clicking the batch. Next my plan was to automate the call of this batch by adding it to the task scheduler in windows. So I changed all the relative paths to absolute paths:
 D:\path\to\python-2.7.10.amd64\python.exe D:\path\to\bin\bla.py D:\path\to\conf\config.conf > D:\path\to\logs\output.txt 
This also still works by double clicking the batch file.
So my next step was adding the batch to the task scheduler but when I run it from there I get this error message:
 Traceback (most recent call last): File "D:\path\to\bin\bla.py", line 159, in logging.config.fileConfig(logFile) File "D:\path\to\python-2.7.10.amd64\lib\logging\confi eConfig formatters = _create_formatters(cp) File "D:\path\to\python-2.7.10.amd64\lib\logging\confi reate_formatters flist = cp.get("formatters", "keys") File "D:\path\to\python-2.7.10.amd64\lib\ConfigParser. raise NoSectionError(section) ConfigParser.NoSectionError: No section: 'formatters' 
So for some reason the python script can't find the conf file by the absolute path I think but I don't understand why. I also tried it with the relative paths in the task scheduler it obviously also doesn't work.
Does anyone of you have a clue why it works straight from the batch but not from the task scheduler ?
Assistant: Thank you guys for your help. It was indeed "just" the working directory I had to set to the location of the bat file
