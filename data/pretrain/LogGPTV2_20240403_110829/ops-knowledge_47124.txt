Assistant: This log chunk shows the processing of an event (TASK_ABORT) by the CommitterEvent Processor #2. It also shows the address change of the server from msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000 to msra-sa-41:9000. The task attempt transition from FAIL_TASK_CLEANUP to FAILED is also recorded. The RackResolver resolves MSRA-SA-39 and MSRA-SA-41 to the default rack. The RMContainerRequestor records 2 failures on the node MININT-FNANLI5.fareast.corp.microsoft.com. The RMContainerAllocator adds the attempt to the list of failed maps. The LeaseRenewer fails to renew the lease for DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1. The RMCommunicator Allocator records the pending and scheduled maps and reduces, as well as the assigned and completed maps and reduces. It also records an error in contacting the RM.
