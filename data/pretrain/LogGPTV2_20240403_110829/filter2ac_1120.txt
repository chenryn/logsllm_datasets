### Title: Black Hat US-22: Browser-Powered Desync Attacks - A New Frontier in HTTP Request Smuggling

**Abstract:**

The recent surge in HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) has led to a wave of critical vulnerabilities, enabling near-complete compromise of numerous major websites. However, the threat has traditionally been limited to attacker-accessible systems with a reverse proxy front-end. In this session, I will introduce a new dimension to HRS by demonstrating how to leverage a victim's web browser as a desynchronization delivery platform, thereby extending the attack surface to single-server websites and internal networks.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Expanding the Attack Surface:**
   - Learn how to combine cross-domain requests with server-side flaws to poison browser connection pools.
   - Discover techniques for installing backdoors and releasing desynchronization worms.
   - See how these methods can be used to compromise targets such as Apache, Akamai, Varnish, Amazon, and multiple web-based VPNs.

2. **Innovative Techniques:**
   - Explore the challenges and opportunities presented by this new frontier.
   - Understand how some traditional desynchronization gadgets can be adapted, while other scenarios require innovative approaches.
   - Gain insights into a battle-tested methodology that combines browser features and custom open-source tools.

3. **Practical Learning:**
   - Access free online labs designed to help you hone your new skillset.
   - Follow the research journey, which includes a black-box analysis strategy that overcame several long-standing desynchronization obstacles.
   - Witness a live demonstration of breaking HTTPS on an Apache server.

**Conclusion:**

This new approach to HTTP Request Smuggling not only broadens the scope of potential targets but also introduces a range of client-side, server-side, and even man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. By sharing our research and providing practical tools, we aim to equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to understand and mitigate these emerging threats.
