Elasticsearch 5 introduced better handling of default settings, that has no
reference doc.
I wonder if "dealing with defaults" could be linked from cluster settings,
index settings, etc.
    #Show defaults
    GET /_cluster/settings?include_defaults
    #Return me to default
    PUT /_cluster/settings
    {
       "persistent": {
          "xpack.monitoring.collection.interval" : null
       }
    }
