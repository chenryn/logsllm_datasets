User: What is the way to get the name of the package which creates specific dir under /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ on Ubuntu 
For example I am trying to get the package name which installs /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/hdinsight_common/ or /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/hdinsight_common/decrypt.sh
can anyone help me with this ?
Thanks
Assistant: Use dpkg -S <path...> for installed packages, or apt-file search <paths...> for packages that might not be installed.
