Abstract
Cyber-theft of trade secrets has become a serious business
threat. Digital watermarking is a popular technique to as-
sist in identifying the source of the ﬁle leakage, whereby a
unique watermark for each insider is hidden in sensitive ﬁles.
However, malicious insiders may use their smartphones to
photograph the secret ﬁle displayed on screens to remove
the embedded hidden digital watermarks due to the optical
noises introduced during photographing. To identify the leak-
age source despite such screen-photo-based leakage attacks,
we leverage Moiré pattern, an optical phenomenon resulted
from the optical interaction between electronic screens and
cameras. As such, we present mID, a new watermark-like tech-
nique that can create a carefully crafted Moiré pattern on the
photo when it is taken towards the screen. We design patterns
that appear to be natural yet can be linked to the identity of
the leaker. We implemented mID and evaluate it with 5 display
devices and 6 smartphones from various manufacturers and
models. The results demonstrate that mID can achieve an aver-
age bit error rate (BER) of 0.6% and can successfully identify
an ID with an average accuracy of 96%, with little inﬂuence
from the type of display devices, cameras, IDs, and ambient
lights.
1 Introduction
Cyber-theft of trade secrets is the illegal leakage of sensi-
tive business information, e.g., digital documents, images, or
codes over cyberspace. It is estimated to cause a loss of C60
billion in economic growth and 289,000 jobs in Europe alone
in 2018, and the losses are expected to be one million jobs by
2025 [26]. Such cyber-thefts are typically involved with in-
siders [44], whereby employees access conﬁdential business
ﬁles legally yet leak them to unauthorized parties via emails
or messaging systems (e.g., WhatsApp). To identify and trace
the source of the leakage, i.e., digital forensics, companies
log ﬁles outbound from the network interface card or USB
ports [28], and insert a digital watermark [1, 7, 12, 20, 23, 29]
that is unique to an employee in each conﬁdential ﬁle.
To avoid exposure, the adversary starts to photograph (usu-
ally with smartphones) the computer screen that displays the
conﬁdential information and leaks it out anonymously [28].
Hereafter, we name this kind of attack as screen-photo-based

leakage attack. After such an attack, unfortunately, the digi-
tal watermark may no longer be recognizable due to the noises
(e.g., the Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noises [4]) introduced
by both the electronic screen and the camera sensors. There-
fore, digital forensics for screen photos, i.e., photos taken
towards screens, is in urgent need.
In this paper, we propose mID, a digital forensics mecha-
nism against the aforementioned screen-photo-based leakage
attack utilizing Moiré patterns [43]. Moiré patterns are optical
phenomena generated during the process of photographing
screens and are often observed in the photos of computer
screens, TV screens, etc. Moiré patterns are ideal for screen
photo forensics because they are natural optical phenomena
and attract almost no, if any, attention of the adversary. As
shown in Fig. 1, mID works as follows: once an adversary logs
into a computer or an application (e.g., an email system) with
her account, mID will modify the displayed content slightly
based on her identity (ID), such that when she takes pictures
of the screen, the modiﬁcation will create Moiré patterns in
the photos. Finally, the embedded Moiré patterns are decoded
to obtain the ID.
Photo forensics via Moiré patterns is promising yet chal-
lenging, since we have to encode IDs inside the Moiré patterns
reliably yet keep the patterns as if they are naturally generated.
In this case, a naive method [17, 30, 43, 45] that encodes IDs
by manipulating the phases of images will not work, because
it may change the display content (e.g., change a straight line
into a wavy one) or create artiﬁcial patterns in the generated

real-time as users modify the window sizes, e.g., maximize the
ﬁle viewer. Last but not the least, decoding IDs from Moiré
patterns in photos has to overcome the distortion caused by
the angle of cameras, the photo content, etc.
To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we design the
encoding and decoding schemes of mID. The key to encoding
is to have as little inﬂuence as possible on the original display
content and to ﬁnd the best display areas for encoding such
that the generated Moiré patterns remain sneaky. Thus, we
ﬁrst employ a vertical grating scheme to imitate the natural
screen-camera channel. Then, we modify the intensity lev-
els of pixels to generate designed Moiré patterns and exploit
the discretized bipolar non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding
method. Considering that humans perceive light and color in
a non-linear manner [33], we further correct the luminance
difference caused by the bipolar NRZ encoding to smoothen
the visual effect of the generated grating image. Furthermore,
mID automatically searches for suitable display areas for in-
formation embedding, such that it maximizes its possibility
of being captured in the photos. To reliably decode the ID
despite image distortion, we ﬁrst extract the Moiré areas with
image rectiﬁcation and window scanning. Then, we trans-
form the Moiré areas into the HSV (hue, saturation, value)
color space [49], and perform saturation balance and enlarge-
ment for high decoding efﬁciency. After that, we use k-means
clustering with the assistance of check codes to recover the
embedded IDs. In summary, our contribution includes below:
• We propose to exploit the natural Moiré phenomenon
existing in the screen-camera channel for screen photo
forensics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
work that addresses screen photo forensics. We believe
that mID is a promising technique and can work comple-
mentarily to several existing ones.
• We design mID, an effective digital forensics mechanism
for ﬁle leakages via photos utilizing Moiré patterns.
• We evaluate mID with 5 display devices and 6 smart-
phones from various manufacturers and models. The
results show that mID can achieve an average BER of
0.6% and an average NER (identity number error rate)
of 4.0%. In addition, it can operate with little inﬂuence
from display devices, cameras, IDs, and ambient lights.
2 Background
In this section, we begin with the principle and proﬁling of
Moiré patterns. Then, we introduce the nonlinearity of the
screen-camera channel that contributes to Moiré patterns in
the screen photos.
2.1 Moiré Pattern
Moiré patterns or Moiré fringes are interference patterns cre-
ated when opaque ruled patterns with transparent gaps are
overlaid [2]. Natural Moiré phenomena can be seen by look-
ing through the folds of a nylon curtain of small mesh, or at
(a) Periodical layer l1
(b) Periodical layer l2
(c) Superposition of l1
and l2
Figure 2: The superposition of periodical layers l1(x,y) =
0.5 + 0.5cos(y) (a) and l2(x,y) = 0.5 + 0.5cos(ycos(15◦) +

two sheets of graph paper twisted 20-30 degrees to each other.
Moreover, a pattern on a TV screen, can interfere with the
shape of light sensors when photographed by a digital camera
and thus generate Moiré patterns. In this paper, we utilize
such an effect for screen photo forensics.
2.2 Moiré Pattern Proﬁling
Moiré patterns are usually generated by the superposition of
periodic layers [2] and appear as new structures that do not
exist in any of the original layers. The periodic layer could
be an image, a nylon curtain, an optical ﬁlter, etc. Assume
l1 and l2 are two periodical layers and s is the generated
superposition pattern, where:
s(x,y) = l1(x,y)× l2(x,y)
(1)
The multiplication of two periodic functions results in nonlin-
earity in the frequency domain. As illustrated in Fig. 2, l1 and
l2 are two cosine functions with the frequency of f1 and f2
respectively. Then, the generated structure s can be calculated
as follows:
s = l1 × l2
= (a1 + b1cos(2π f1t))× (a2 + b2cos(2π f2t))
= a1a2 + a1b2cos(2π f2t) + a2b1cos(2π f1t)
+ b1b2cos(2π( f1 + f2)t) + b1b2cos(2π( f1 − f2)t)
(2)
which contains two new components ( f1 + f2) and ( f1− f2) in
the frequency domain. Since human eyes are more sensitive to
low frequency signals, the new component ( f1 − f2) becomes
noticeable as Moiré patterns if it is lower than the cutoff
frequency of human visual system (HVS) [51] and meanwhile
has a signiﬁcant amplitude.
2.3 Moiré Pattern of Screen-camera Channel
Digital cameras often cause Moiré phenomenon when taking
pictures of digital screens, e.g., TV screens or liquid-crystal
displays (LCDs). The nonlinearity arises from the interfer-
ence of digital screens and the Color Filter Array (CFA) on
the camera image sensors, which we call the screen-camera
channel. The process is depicted in Fig. 3.
Screen Image. The unit structure of digital screens, e.g.,
LCD screens, usually consists of tri-color (red (R), green (G)
and blue (B)) ﬁlters and emits corresponding light separately,

e.g., LCD panel shown on the left of Fig. 3. When taking
a picture towards an LCD screen, the unit structures of the
LCD panel are projected onto the camera sensors and form a
layer of spatial patterns, i.e., the image of the LCD screen. We
denote the image of the LCD screen on the camera sensors as
layer l1 with a frequency of f1, which interacts with the CFA
directly to generate Moiré patterns. To distinguish, we denote
(cid:48)
the layer formed by the original LCD screen as layer l
1 with a

frequency of f

are also applicable.
CFA. In the screen-camera channel, the light emitted by
the screen is received by the camera image sensors. A CFA
(i.e., a mosaic of tiny color ﬁlters) is placed over the camera
image sensor to capture the color information. Bayer ﬁlter is
the most common ﬁlter on smartphones’ built-in cameras [46],
which gives information about the intensity of light in RGB
wavelength regions in a 2 × 2 array (e.g., CFA of camera
shown in the middle of Fig. 3). As a result, the CFA forms
another layer of spatial patterns, which we denote as layer l2
with a frequency of f2.
Nonlinear Optical Interaction. According to the Moiré
pattern proﬁling, the superposition of l1 (image of the screen)
and l2 (CFA of the camera) can generate new components in
the frequency domain. When the camera is positioned at a
proper distance and angle, the generated component ( f1 − f2)
falls in the observable frequency range and appears as ripple
patterns on the captured screen photo, i.e., the Moiré patterns
caused by the screen-camera channel (shown in Fig. 3).
Inspired by the natural Moiré phenomenon existing in the
screen-camera channel, we propose to exploit the nonlinear
optical interaction between the CFA of the camera and the
well-designed camouﬂaging periodical patterns displayed on
the screen, to embed Moiré-pattern-based ID, i.e., mID, into
the screen photo, to trace the source of ﬁle leakages.
3 Threat Model
For the screen-photo-based leakage attacks, the adversary’s
goal is to leak conﬁdential information via the photo taken
by smartphones. The photo can be delivered to unauthorized

parties from networking applications such as WhatsApp or a
portable disk. In this attack scenario, we assume the company
who wants to trace the screen photo, i.e., ﬁle forensics, has
full control over the conﬁdential ﬁle. In other words, they can
modify the hardware and software such as screen conﬁgura-
tion. For the adversary, we have the following assumptions:
• Screen-capturing with Smartphones. To avoid being
logged and caught, the attacker tends to take a picture of
the screen displaying the conﬁdential information with
her smartphones. The adversary wishes to capture the
conﬁdential content completely and clearly, and there-
fore they should place their smartphones close enough
at a good angle.
• Untraceability over Internet. The adversary is able to
leak the screen photos anonymously via open networks,
e.g., public Wi-Fi. As a result, the path of the photo
leakage cannot be traced by the company.
• Photo Processing. To reduce the risk of being traced,
we assume the adversary may process the captured
screen photos. The possible processing operations in-
clude photo duplication, photo compression, image
up/downscaling, format conversion, image cut, etc.
4 Design
4.1 Design Requirement
To trace the source of ﬁle leakages via Moiré patterns, mID
shall satisfy the following requirements.
Subtle Visual Difference to User. The embedded mID
shall have no obvious visual impact to users for the sake
of user experience. In other words, users should not be able
to recognize what mID has modiﬁed to the display.
Vision Insensitivity to Adversary. The crafted Moiré pat-
terns appeared in the photos shall look similar to the ones
naturally generated by the screen-camera channel. Otherwise,
the adversary may notice the existence of mID and abandon
the image to avoid being traced.
4.2 Overview of mID
The basic idea is to generate mID by embedding identity num-
bers into the superimposed Moiré pattern via its intensity

phases with four modules: (a) mID generation, (b) mID embed-
ding, (c) mID extraction, and (d) mID decoding, as shown in
Fig. 4.
In the encoding phase, the mID Generation module ﬁrst
creates the modiﬁcation that will be applied to the original
display based on the IDs, and the mID Embedding module
will ﬁnd the best areas to apply such modiﬁcation. The design
goal of the encoding phase is that the modiﬁcation cannot be
observed visually by users but will be captured by cameras
and form a seemingly natural Moiré pattern, i.e., mID. The mID
Generation consists of (a) mID Framing that forms a proper
frame, (b) Grating Generation that helps to create Moiré
patterns, and (c) ID Encoding that adds the information of
IDs to the Moiré patterns. Note that designing grating is
similar to ﬁnding the carrier signals and the ID encoding is
similar to ﬁnding the modulation scheme in communication.
To generate Moiré patterns, the screen pixels are manipu-
lated to form a display grating, which has a periodic structure
and may appear as stripes. To make the patterns looks as if
they are naturally generated, the display grating is designed to
be vertical since the LCD panel has a vertical grating structure.
Second, to encode the mID into the display grating without
noticed by users, we propose a discretized bipolar non-return-
to-zero encoding method, which manipulates the intensity lev-
els of the generated Moiré patterns to represent information.
As humans perceive light and color in a non-linear manner,
we correct the luminance difference caused by the discretized
encoding to ensure user visual uniformity. Third, to embed
the generated gratings into the screen and maximize their
possibility of being captured in the photos, we automatically
analyze the current page of the screen and search for suitable
regions for embedding.
In the decoding phase, for a given screen photo that con-
tains embedded mID, the mID Extraction module tries to
remove the camera distortion with image rectiﬁcation and
extracts the regions of Moiré patterns, i.e., Moiré areas, with
window scanning. Then, we recover the embedded identity
numbers via the mID Decoding module, in which we ﬁrst
transform the Moiré areas into the HSV (hue, saturation,
value) color space, then perform saturation balance and en-
largement for image pre-processing, and ﬁnally recover mID
