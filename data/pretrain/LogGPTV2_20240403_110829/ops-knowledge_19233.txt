User: I have an archive which I do not want to extract but check for each of its contents whether it is a file or a directory.
os.path.isdir and os.path.isfile do not work because I am working on archive. The archive can be anyone of tar,bz2,zip or tar.gz(so I cannot use their specific libraries). Plus, the code should work on any platform like linux or windows. Can anybody help me how to do it?
Assistant: I got the answer. It is that we can use two commands: archive.getall_members() and archive.getfile_members(). 
We iterate over each of them and store the file/folder names in two arrays a1(contains file/folder names) and a2(contains file names only). If both the arrays contain that element, then it is a file otherwise it is a folder.
