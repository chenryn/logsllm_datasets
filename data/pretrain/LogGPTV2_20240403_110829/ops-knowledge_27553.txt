"python E:\python\python2.79\a.py" can run..
..I am a newbie in python...I will appeciate for your answers
Assistant: Usually, when you're using a shell, you're positioned in a directory in the filesystem. The first example, python a.py uses a relative path; it says "the file I want to run is a.py in the very same directory I'm currently in". The second example, python E:\python\python2.79\a.py uses an absolute path; it says "no matter where I'm in the filesystem, the complete path to the file I want to run is this one". Then, simply, if you're not in the directory where a.py is, and you run python a.py, python will say it couldn't find that file.
