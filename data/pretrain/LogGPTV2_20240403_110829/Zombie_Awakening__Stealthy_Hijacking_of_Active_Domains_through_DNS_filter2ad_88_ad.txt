### Ethical Domain Hijacking Experiment

To conduct the domain hijacking experiment ethically, we utilized a domain under our control. Specifically, we registered a domain and configured its Resource Records (RRs) to include an exploitable stale Name Server (NS) record in the Second-Level Domain (SLDns). We then built a zombie resolution path with a DNS hosting provider (i.e., DigitalOcean), as described in Section 3. We sent a series of DNS queries on the domain to each resolver to verify whether it could be used to execute the Zaw attack.

#### Experiment Design

We designed two experiments:
1. **Against Public Resolvers**: To test the vulnerability of public resolvers.
2. **Against Popular DNS Implementations**: To test the behavior of different DNS implementations.

#### Public Resolvers - Experiment Setting

- **Domain Configuration**: The domain had two NS records in its Top-Level Domain (TLD) zone and four NS records in its SLD zone. Two of the SLDns NS records were identical to the TLDns NS records, and the other two were under the attacker's control.
- **TLDns Configuration**: Configured to respond with the A record carrying the IP set by the domain owner (IPcorrect).
- **SLDns Configuration**: Two nameservers in SLDns were set to respond with the attacker’s IP (IPattacker).
- **TTL Settings**: 
  - A record carrying IPcorrect: 30 seconds (to force recursive resolution).
  - A record carrying IPattacker: 4 hours (to increase cache hit probability).

#### Public Resolvers - Experiment

1. **Step 1**: Query the A record for a generated subdomain to cause the resolver to cache the record with IPcorrect.
2. **Step 2**: Query the NS record of the domain to evaluate if the resolver overwrites cached TLDns with SLDns.
3. **Step 3**: Repeat Step 1 until IPattacker is received, up to 50 times. For each unsuccessful attempt, repeat Step 2 to improve the chances of success.

#### Public Resolvers - Findings

- **Affected Resolvers**: 10 out of 12 top public resolver operators (83.33%) had at least one affected resolver.
- **Attack Attempts**: Successful attacks took 1 to 28 attempts, with an average of 6.5 and a median of 3.
- **DNSSEC Validation**: All top popular resolvers support DNSSEC except Yandex.DNS. Only one of the 628 vulnerable domains was properly DNSSEC-signed.

#### Ethical Consideration

- **Avoiding Real-World Impact**: Queries were sent directly to TLD nameservers and PVDs’ authoritative servers, bypassing caching resolvers.
- **Controlled Environment**: Experiments were conducted on domains under our control, avoiding real-world services.
- **Reporting and Mitigation**: Findings were reported to the owners of vulnerable domains, and assistance was offered to address the issues.

### Analysis and Measurement

#### Characteristics of Hijackable Domains

- **Total Hijackable Domains**: 628
- **Categories**:
  - Sports: 63
  - Business: 34
  - Financial: 31
  - Shopping: 31
  - Cloud/Hosting: 18
  - Government: 6
  - Education: 31
- **Zrefs Distribution**: 244 domains (38.85%) have Zrefs pointing to Hetzner Online GmbH.
- **TLDs**: .com (60%), .gr, .ir

#### Exploitable Duration

- **Longitudinal Study**: 91 days
- **Vulnerability Duration**:
  - 89.97% (565 domains) vulnerable for at least 30 days.
  - 65.29% (410 domains) remained vulnerable for the entire analysis duration.
  - 4.93% (31 domains) vulnerable for fewer than 10 days.

#### Zref Origin Investigation

- **Transition Behavior**: 109 (17.36%) hijackable domains showed transition behaviors, indicating a move from one DNS server to another.

#### Measuring Attack Complexity

- **Time Slot for Poisoning**: Possibility of finding a valid A record not in the cache.
- **Resolver Selection Probability**: Probability of selecting a Zref.
- **Proper DNSSEC Implementation**: Importance of DNSSEC in mitigating the Zaw threat.
