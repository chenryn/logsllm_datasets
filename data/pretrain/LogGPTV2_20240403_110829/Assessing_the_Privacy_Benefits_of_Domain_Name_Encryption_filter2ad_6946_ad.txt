### Large-Scale Measurements and Researcher Access

The project provides large-scale measurements and grants researchers access to its extensive dataset, which includes 110,000 IP addresses. This dataset is significantly larger than those from the Active DNS Project and Rapid7, offering a more comprehensive view of domain name resolutions.

### Dataset Comparison

#### Active DNS Project
- **Resolution Frequency**: High (domains are resolved multiple times a day).
- **Coverage**: Primarily second-level domains from TLD zone files.
- **Data Source**: Georgia Tech.

#### Rapid7
- **Resolution Frequency**: Low (domains are resolved once a week).
- **Coverage**: 1.8 billion domains, including lower-level FQDNs obtained through web crawling and targeted scanning with Zmap.
- **Data Source**: AWS EC2 nodes in the US.

#### Our Dataset
- **Resolution Frequency**: Regular (from vantage points around the world).
- **Coverage**: Global lists of Alexa and Majestic, including both second-level and lower-level FQDNs that serve web content.
- **Data Source**: Vantage points worldwide for localized DNS responses from CDNs.

### k-Anonymity Analysis

**Figure 9: Top Providers with High-Churn IP Addresses**
- Shows the top providers with the highest number of high-churn IP addresses.

**Figure 10: CDF of k-Anonymity Values**
- Compares the k-anonymity values per domain across the Active DNS, Rapid7, and our datasets.
- **k = 1**: 
  - Active DNS Project: 5.3% single-hosted domains.
  - Rapid7: 54.3% single-hosted domains.
  - Our dataset: 18.7% single-hosted domains.
- **Explanation**: The higher percentage in Rapid7 is due to the inclusion of many lower-level FQDNs, while the Active DNS Project focuses on A records from TLD zone files. Our dataset falls between these two, reflecting a balanced approach.

**Figure 11: CDF of k-Anonymity Values for Common Domains**
- Compares the k-anonymity values for common domains across the three datasets.
- **Single-Hosted Domains**:
  - Rapid7: 4.1%
  - Active DNS: 11.7%
  - Our dataset: 20.4%
- **Explanation**: Some domains classified as single-hosted in our dataset are multi-hosted in the larger datasets, confirming that our dataset captures a subset of popular and less popular domains.

### Recommendations for Enhancing Privacy

#### Full Domain Name Confidentiality
- **Current Issues**: Domain names are exposed through SNI in TLS and traditional DNS.
- **Solution**: Deployment of DoH/DoT and ESNI to encrypt domain names.
- **Challenges**: Major organizations (e.g., Google, Cloudflare, Firefox) support DoH/DoT, but ESNI adoption is lagging.

#### Domain Owners
- **Hosting Providers**: Seek providers with a high ratio of co-hosted domains per IP address and dynamic domain-to-IP mappings.
- **PTR Records**: Avoid configuring PTR records unless necessary (e.g., for email servers).
- **Dynamic IPs**: Prefer providers with frequent IP address rotation.

#### Hosting and CDN Providers
- **Co-Hosting**: Group more websites under the same IP address to improve k-anonymity.
- **Traffic Patterns**: Cluster websites based on traffic patterns and popularity to hinder website fingerprinting.
- **Dynamic IP Management**: Implement more frequent IP address changes to enhance privacy, despite operational challenges.

### Impact of Domain Encryption

#### Internet Censorship
- **Current State**: Censors use domain names in DNS requests and TLS handshakes for filtering.
- **Future State**: Encrypted domain names will shift censors to IP-based blocking, increasing the cost and collateral damage.
- **Provider Adaptation**: Providers may adapt to improve privacy, making IP-based blocking more challenging.

#### Network Visibility
- **Current State**: Firewalls, IDS, and anti-spam filters rely on domain name information.
- **Future State**: Loss of visibility under DoH/DoT and ESNI, impacting domain reputation systems.
- **Possible Solutions**: Use TLS proxying with custom certificates, though this defeats privacy benefits.

### Related Work

#### Security and Privacy
- **Domain Squatting**: Techniques like typo-squatting, homograph-based squatting, and combo-squatting.
- **DNS Poisoning**: On-path observers can tamper with DNS responses.
- **Privacy Risks**: Centralized DNS resolvers and on-path observers pose significant privacy risks.

#### Previous Studies
- **DNS Ecosystem**: Studies on trusted computing base, dependencies, and co-location.
- **Performance**: DoH/DoT performance compared to traditional DNS, with varying results.
- **Robustness**: Large-scale measurements to study the robustness and centralization of the DNS ecosystem.

### Conclusion

While the deployment of encrypted SNI and DoH/DoT offers significant security benefits, meaningful privacy benefits require additional efforts. Specifically, domain name encryption alone is not sufficient; the visibility of IP addresses still allows on-path observers to infer visited websites. Further collaboration and implementation of the recommended measures by all stakeholders are essential to achieve the desired privacy outcomes.
