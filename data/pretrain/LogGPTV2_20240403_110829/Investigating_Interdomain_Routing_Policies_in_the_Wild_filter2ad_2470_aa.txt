Abstract
Models of Internet routing are critical for studies of Internet secu-
rity, reliability and evolution, which often rely on simulations of the
Internet’s routing system. Accurate models are difﬁcult to build and
suffer from a dearth of ground truth data, as ISPs often treat their
connectivity and routing policies as trade secrets. In this environ-
ment, researchers rely on a number of simplifying assumptions and
models proposed over a decade ago, which are widely criticized for
their inability to capture routing policies employed in practice.
In this study we put Internet topologies and models under the
microscope to understand where they fail to capture real routing
behavior. We measure data plane paths from thousands of vantage
points, located in eyeball networks around the globe, and ﬁnd that
between 14-35% of routing decisions are not explained by existing
models. We then investigate these cases, and identify root causes
such as selective preﬁx announcement, misclassiﬁcation of under-
sea cables, and geographic constraints. Our work highlights the
need for models that address such cases, and motivates the need for
further investigation of evolving Internet connectivity.

INTRODUCTION
Research on existing and new protocols on the Internet is chal-
lenging because key aspects of the network topology are hidden
from public view by interdomain routing protocols. Further, de-
ploying new protocols at Internet scale requires convincing large
numbers of autonomous networks to participate. As a result, net-
working researchers rely on assumptions, models, and simulations
to evaluate new protocols [13, 26], network reliability [20, 41], and
security [1, 16, 24].

Our existing models of interdomain routing [11], however, have
important limitations. They are built and validated on the same
incomplete topology datasets, typically routes observed via route
monitors such as RouteViews and RIS [33, 39]. These vantage
points expose a large fraction of paths from global research & ed-
ucation networks (GREN) and core networks, but they are incom-
plete in two keys ways. First, they expose few paths to and from
eyeball and content networks. Second, they do not expose less pre-
ferred paths that would be used if the most preferred path was not
available. As a result, they do not capture partial peering, more
complex routing policies based on trafﬁc engineering, or load bal-
ancing and the rich peering mesh which exists near the edge of the
network [35].
While limitations of our existing models are well known [27,29,
35]–and are even being addressed in recent work [15]–we lack a
solid understanding of how much these limitations impact our abil-
ity to accurately model the interdomain routing system. Recent
work has attempted to address this issue by observing destination-
based routing violations in control plane data [28] and by surveying
a population of network operators about their policies [12]. How-
ever, these approaches are limited in terms of scale and their ability
to observe behavior at the network edge.
In this paper, we take a systematic approach to understand how
our models of routing policies [11] hold in practice. We leverage
a combination of data plane measurements covering the network
edge (Section 3.1) and control plane experiments which allow us
to directly measure relative preference of routes (Section 3.2). We
create a methodology that accounts for numerous potential causes
of violations to our assumptions including sibling ASes [4], com-
plex AS relationships [15], preﬁx-speciﬁc routing policies, and the
impact of geography. We investigate the prevalence of each of these
causes in AS-level paths observed via measurements of the data and
control planes.
We revisit generally held assumptions and models of Internet
routing. Our goal is not to measure a complete Internet topology;
rather, we seek to improve our understanding of routing decisions
made by ASes when routing their trafﬁc. Towards this goal we
make the following observations for our measured paths:
• Known hybrid and partial transit relationships (e.g., those ex-
plored in [15]) contribute a surprisingly small amount to unex-
pected routing decisions.
• Per-preﬁx routing policies appear to explain 10-20% of unex-
pected routing decisions, where an AS chooses a longer or more
expensive path than our model predicts.
• We ﬁnd that some large content providers like Akamai and Net-
ﬂix are destinations for a large fraction of unexpected routing
decisions (21% and 17%, respectively).
71• Routing decisions vary based on geography. We ﬁnd that paths
traversing multiple continents deviate from our models more,
owing to undersea cable ASes which are not accounted for in
our models. We also observed a tendency for ASes to prefer
non-international paths when endpoints are in the same country.
Our results highlight areas where more investigation would yield
the largest payoff in terms of improving our accuracy when mod-
eling AS relationships and routing policies. We also identify
key areas, speciﬁcally investigating preﬁx-speciﬁc routing policies,
where additional vantage points and looking glass servers could im-
prove the ﬁdelity of our AS topology data.
2. MODELING INTERDOMAIN ROUTING
The now standard model of routing policies was developed
by Gao and Rexford [10, 11] based on seminal work by Grif-
ﬁn, Sheppard, and Wilfong [17] and Huston [18, 19].
In this
model, ASes connect to each other based on business relationships:
(1) customer-provider, where the customer pays the provider, and
(2) peer-to-peer, where the ASes exchange trafﬁc at no cost. This
model gives the following view of local preferences and export
policies, based on the economic considerations of ASes:
Local Preferences. An AS will prefer routes through a neigh-
boring customer, then routes through a neighboring peer, and then
routes through a provider. In other words, an AS will prefer cheaper
routes.
Export Policy. A customer route may be exported to all neigh-
boring ASes. A peer or provider route may only be exported to
customers.
This model is sometimes augmented with the assumption that
ASes only consider the next hop AS on the path when making their
routing decisions. This simpliﬁes analysis and makes debugging
more tractable [20]. Simulation studies also often restrict path se-
lection to the shortest among all paths satisfying Local Preference
and use tie-breakers to induce unique routing decisions when AS
path lengths are same [13, 14].
While the above model and variations thereof have been used in
many studies (e.g.,
[1, 13, 16, 21, 41]), it is well known that this
model fails to capture many aspects of the interdomain routing sys-
tem [27, 29, 35]. These aspects include AS relationships that vary
based on the geographic region [15] or destination preﬁx, and traf-
ﬁc engineering via hot-potato routing or load balancing.
Prior work has used traceroute measurements and BGP data to
address some of these issues (e.g., [27, 29]); however, these mea-
surements only offer a glimpse into ASes’ routing preferences.
Namely, they expose only the set of paths that are in use at the
time of measurements. In contrast, we use active control plane ex-
periments (PEERING [37]) to expose less preferred paths. Further,
these datasets have poor or no coverage of paths used by edge net-
works [7]. On a smaller scale, network operators were surveyed
about their routing policies to better understand how our models
correspond to practice [12], but the scale and representativeness of
a survey approach makes generalizing these observations infeasi-
ble.
3. METHODOLOGY
We aim to understand the gap between interdomain routing mod-
els and empirically observed behavior on the Internet. Our method-
ology combines two measurement techniques to gain better visibil-
ity into interdomain routing policies. First, we passively observe
routing decisions on paths towards popular content networks (Sec-
tion 3.1). We leverage the RIPE Atlas platform which provides a
large collection of vantage points located around the world for our
traceroute measurements. We thus observe routing decisions for
broad range of hosts from variety of vantage points. One limitation
of this approach lies in its passiveness as it only provides informa-
tion about paths that are in use at the time of measurements. We
do not get any information about the alternate paths available to
an AS. Our second technique (Section 3.2) overcomes the above
mentioned limitation and exposes less preferred paths for different
ASes. We use PEERING [2, 37, 40] to selectively poison BGP an-
nouncements and force ASes to choose an alternate path, then we
use RIPE Atlas probes as vantage points to run traceroutes towards
poisoned preﬁxes to observe these alternate paths. This approach
of actively probing routing decisions enables us to discover less
preferred paths and also reverse engineer the BGP decision pro-
cess. However, the PEERING platform is currently limited to few
locations from which we can send poisoned announcements.
3.1 Passively observing route decisions
It is well known that a disproportionately large amount of Inter-
net trafﬁc originates from a few popular content providers [23, 36].
However, there is little empirical data about the paths this trafﬁc
takes [23]. We target these paths with our measurements. Note
that it is not our goal to observe routing decisions for the entire In-
ternet. Rather, we focus on the more tractable task of measuring
a subset of important Internet paths (those carrying most trafﬁc)
from a diverse set of vantage points, and putting those paths under
the microscope to understand how and why they differ from paths
predicted by routing models.
Selecting content providers. We consider a list of the top appli-
cations from Sandvine [36] and top Web sites from Quantcast [31].
From these lists, we isolate top HTTP and non-HTTP hosts in terms
of number of downstream bytes and number of visits. Finally,
we arrive at a list of 34 DNS names representing 14 large content
providers.

Vantage points (VPs). RIPE Atlas has broad global coverage, but
is known to have a disproportionate fraction of probes skewed to-
wards Europe. To avoid a bias towards European ASes, we picked
equal number of probes from each continent. For every continent,
we picked probes in a round robin fashion from different countries
and ASes so that selected probes cover a wide range of ASes. Ta-
ble 1 summarizes the location of these probes in terms of AS type
using the categorization method of Oliveira et al.
[30]. The bulk
of the probes are located near the network edge in stub and small
ISP networks. To measure paths to content providers, each RIPE
Atlas node performs a DNS lookup for each of the 34 content DNS
names, and then performs a traceroute to the resolved IP. We use
1,998 RIPE Atlas probes located in 633 ASes, distributed accord-
ing to our sampling methodology.
Data set. We used maximum probing rate allowed by RIPE At-
las to perform 28,051 traceroutes towards selected hosts. These
traceroutes ended up in a total of 218 destination ASes. The num-
ber of destination ASes is large relative the number of content
providers because large numbers of content servers are hosted out-
side the provider’s network (e.g., inside ISPs) [5]. We convert the
72traceroute-based IP-level paths into AS paths using the method de-
scribed by Chen et al. [7]. Since interdomain routing is destination-
based, we can observe routing decisions for all ASes along the path
to a given destination. We thus observe routing decisions for a total
of 746 ASes.
3.2 Actively probing route decisions
Passive measurements observe only the most preferred route for
an AS toward a destination. We use PEERING [2, 37, 40] to expose
alternate, less preferred routes and to attempt to reverse engineer
BGP decisions.
PEERING operates an ASN and owns IP address space that we can
announce via several upstream providers. PEERING allows us to
manipulate BGP announcements of its IP preﬁxes and observe how
ASes on the path react. We used PEERING to announce preﬁxes
using six US universities (Georgia Tech, Clemson, University of
Southern California, Northeastern, Stony Brook, and Cornell) and
