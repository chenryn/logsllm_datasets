## Abstract
Accurate models of Internet routing are essential for studies on Internet security, reliability, and evolution. These studies often rely on simulations of the Internet's routing system. However, building accurate models is challenging due to a lack of ground truth data, as ISPs typically treat their connectivity and routing policies as trade secrets. As a result, researchers often rely on simplifying assumptions and models proposed over a decade ago, which are criticized for their inability to capture real-world routing policies.

In this study, we analyze Internet topologies and models to identify where they fail to capture real routing behavior. We measure data plane paths from thousands of vantage points located in eyeball networks globally and find that 14-35% of routing decisions are not explained by existing models. We then investigate these cases and identify root causes such as selective prefix announcements, misclassification of undersea cables, and geographic constraints. Our work highlights the need for more comprehensive models and motivates further investigation into evolving Internet connectivity.

## 1. Introduction
Research on Internet protocols is challenging because key aspects of network topology are hidden by interdomain routing protocols. Deploying new protocols at Internet scale requires convincing many autonomous networks to participate. Consequently, networking researchers rely on assumptions, models, and simulations to evaluate new protocols, network reliability, and security.

Existing models of interdomain routing have significant limitations. They are built and validated using incomplete topology datasets, typically routes observed via route monitors like RouteViews and RIS. These vantage points expose a large fraction of paths from global research and education networks (GREN) and core networks but are incomplete in two key ways: they expose few paths to and from eyeball and content networks and do not expose less preferred paths that would be used if the most preferred path was unavailable. This results in an inability to capture partial peering, complex routing policies based on traffic engineering, load balancing, and the rich peering mesh near the network edge.

While the limitations of existing models are well-known, there is a lack of understanding of how much these limitations impact the ability to accurately model the interdomain routing system. Recent work has attempted to address this issue by observing destination-based routing violations in control plane data and surveying network operators about their policies. However, these approaches are limited in scale and their ability to observe behavior at the network edge.

In this paper, we take a systematic approach to understand how our models of routing policies hold in practice. We use a combination of data plane measurements covering the network edge and control plane experiments to directly measure the relative preference of routes. Our methodology accounts for numerous potential causes of violations, including sibling ASes, complex AS relationships, prefix-specific routing policies, and geographic constraints. We investigate the prevalence of these causes in AS-level paths observed via measurements of the data and control planes.

We revisit generally held assumptions and models of Internet routing. Our goal is not to measure a complete Internet topology but to improve our understanding of routing decisions made by ASes. Our observations include:
- Known hybrid and partial transit relationships contribute a surprisingly small amount to unexpected routing decisions.
- Prefix-specific routing policies explain 10-20% of unexpected routing decisions, where an AS chooses a longer or more expensive path than our model predicts.
- Large content providers like Akamai and Netflix are destinations for a significant fraction of unexpected routing decisions (21% and 17%, respectively).
- Routing decisions vary based on geography, with paths traversing multiple continents deviating more from our models due to undersea cable ASes not accounted for in our models. We also observed a tendency for ASes to prefer non-international paths when endpoints are in the same country.

Our results highlight areas where more investigation would yield the largest payoff in terms of improving our accuracy when modeling AS relationships and routing policies. We also identify key areas, specifically investigating prefix-specific routing policies, where additional vantage points and looking glass servers could improve the fidelity of our AS topology data.

## 2. Modeling Interdomain Routing
The standard model of routing policies, developed by Gao and Rexford, is based on business relationships between ASes:
1. **Customer-Provider**: The customer pays the provider.
2. **Peer-to-Peer**: ASes exchange traffic at no cost.

This model gives the following view of local preferences and export policies:
- **Local Preferences**: An AS will prefer routes through a neighboring customer, then routes through a neighboring peer, and then routes through a provider, preferring cheaper routes.
- **Export Policy**: A customer route may be exported to all neighboring ASes. A peer or provider route may only be exported to customers.

This model is sometimes augmented with the assumption that ASes only consider the next hop AS on the path when making routing decisions, simplifying analysis and debugging. Simulation studies often restrict path selection to the shortest among all paths satisfying local preferences and use tie-breakers for unique routing decisions when AS path lengths are the same.

While this model and its variations have been widely used, it fails to capture many aspects of the interdomain routing system, including AS relationships that vary based on geographic region or destination prefix, and traffic engineering via hot-potato routing or load balancing.

Prior work has used traceroute measurements and BGP data to address some of these issues, but these measurements only offer a glimpse into ASes' routing preferences, exposing only the set of paths in use at the time of measurements. In contrast, we use active control plane experiments (PEERING) to expose less preferred paths. These datasets have poor or no coverage of paths used by edge networks. On a smaller scale, network operators were surveyed about their routing policies, but the scale and representativeness of a survey approach make generalizing these observations infeasible.

## 3. Methodology
Our goal is to understand the gap between interdomain routing models and empirically observed behavior on the Internet. Our methodology combines two measurement techniques to gain better visibility into interdomain routing policies.

### 3.1 Passively Observing Route Decisions
A large amount of Internet traffic originates from a few popular content providers, but there is little empirical data about the paths this traffic takes. We target these paths with our measurements. We focus on measuring a subset of important Internet paths (those carrying most traffic) from a diverse set of vantage points.

**Selecting Content Providers**: We consider a list of top applications from Sandvine and top websites from Quantcast, isolating top HTTP and non-HTTP hosts in terms of downstream bytes and visits. We arrive at a list of 34 DNS names representing 14 large content providers.

**Vantage Points (VPs)**: RIPE Atlas has broad global coverage but is skewed towards Europe. To avoid bias, we picked equal numbers of probes from each continent, ensuring a wide range of ASes. Table 1 summarizes the location of these probes in terms of AS type using the categorization method of Oliveira et al. The bulk of the probes are located near the network edge in stub and small ISP networks.

**Data Set**: We used the maximum probing rate allowed by RIPE Atlas to perform 28,051 traceroutes towards selected hosts, resulting in a total of 218 destination ASes. We convert traceroute-based IP-level paths into AS paths using the method described by Chen et al. Since interdomain routing is destination-based, we observe routing decisions for all ASes along the path to a given destination, totaling 746 ASes.

### 3.2 Actively Probing Route Decisions
Passive measurements observe only the most preferred route for an AS toward a destination. We use PEERING to expose alternate, less preferred routes and attempt to reverse engineer BGP decisions. PEERING operates an ASN and owns IP address space that we can announce via several upstream providers. We manipulate BGP announcements of its IP prefixes and observe how ASes on the path react. We used PEERING to announce prefixes using six US universities (Georgia Tech, Clemson, University of Southern California, Northeastern, Stony Brook, and Cornell).

By combining these two techniques, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of interdomain routing policies and the factors that influence routing decisions.
