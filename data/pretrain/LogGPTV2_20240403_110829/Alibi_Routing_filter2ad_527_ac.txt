note this minimum RTT by (cid:96)F (q). Concretely, if q’s lowest
measured RTT to n is L(q, n), then q can be certain that n is
not in the forbidden region so long as
L(q, n)  0 such
that L(p, q) + δ = (cid:96)F (p). These together would imply that
δ = −∆, and thus that ∆ < 0, a contradiction.
We next show that the Alibi Routing protocol is not sus-
ceptible to packet manipulation by nodes within a forbidden
region. Moreover, this security property ensures that any
packet from an attacker in a forbidden region will be ignored
altogether.

PROPERTY 2. All trustworthy peers ignore all packets that
traverse F .
To see this, suppose peer p is trustworthy. Suppose further
that p forwarded a packet through q, but that in the process of
doing so, the packet traversed F and yet p did not ignore it.
Because a trustworthy peer p ignores any packet that violates
Eq. (1), the supposition that p did not ignore it would mean
that R(p, q) (cid:28) minf∈F (R(p, f ) + R(f, q)). The only way
that this inequality could hold for a packet that traversed F
is if q and F are colluding, and thus that q ∈ F . However,
Property 1 says that, if p is trustworthy and q ∈ F , then p
would not believe q to be safe, and therefore would not have
forwarded a packet through q in the ﬁrst place. We thus have
our contradiction: a packet that traverses F must have been
ignored by any trustworthy peer.
Note that establishing Properties 1 and 2 required no as-
sumptions of the peers’ neighbor sets. This leads to an inter-
esting corollary that Alibi Routing is safe regardless of any
peer’s neighbor set.
Attacks on progress. An adversary could launch an eclipse
attack [41] by attempting to populate a victim’s neighbor set
with all attackers. Note that such an attack would require an
attacker to be very close to the victim. Although, as we have
shown, the attacker cannot violate the victim’s safety, it may
be able to impact progress. Recall that next-hop peers are
ranked by their progress condition: the neighbor n who min-
imizes (cid:96)T (n) − (cid:96)F (n) makes the most progress. Peers who
are most susceptible to an eclipse attack are those who are
closest to F (n) and thus have small values of (cid:96)F (n) Thus,
the more likely a peer n is susceptible to an eclipse attack by
attackers in F , the greater the value of (cid:96)T (n)−(cid:96)F (n) in gen-
eral, and thus the less likely n will be chosen as a next hop in
a query. Constraining progress therefore requires proximity
to otherwise viable relays.
Non-attacks.
We close this section by describing some attacks on users
that we do not believe need to be solved by a provable route
avoidance system, as they can be solved by combining Alibi
Routing with a more traditional system.
Laundering attack trafﬁc. In any overlay routing system,
relays could be used for reﬂecting attack trafﬁc: s could send
attack trafﬁc to d via a relay r to make it appear that r is
the one attacking. We do not believe there is any funda-
mental difference between such an attack in Alibi Routing
and other systems, and so traditional approaches apply (e.g.,
white-listing sources or destinations, as in Tor [10], and rate-
limiting how much a peer contributes to the system, as in
BitTorrent [9]).
Sending copies of data to attackers. Any host or router
on the path from s through an alibi to d could send copies
of packets to the forbidden region. This does not violate
Alibi Routing’s goals: to establish an unadulterated path of
communication between s and d. Keeping communication
private is, of course, an important issue: to this end, s and
d ought to employ end-to-end encryption. Further, if s and
d desire sender and/or receiver anonymity, they should ap-
ply anonymous systems such as Tor [10] or P5 [40]. Alibi
Routing can be composed with such systems to provide de-
fense in depth, for instance by using the alibi condition when
constructing Tor circuits (§7).
6. EVALUATION
We present an evaluation of Alibi Routing using both sim-
ulations and an implementation deployed on PlanetLab. Our
data and code are publicly available.
6.1 Who can be avoided?
The ﬁrst question we seek to evaluate is: for what source,
destination, forbidden region triples could alibis exist?
To answer this, we compute target regions using the method
described in Section 4.2.2 with both data collected from Plan-
etLab and using a simulated deployment of 20,000 nodes.
For forbidden regions, we used several countries identiﬁed in
the 2012 Internet Enemies Report [34]—China, Syria, North
Korea, and Saudi Arabia—as well as the three other coun-
tries with the most number of Internet users as of the time of
this writing—USA, India, and Japan.
Who can avoid whom? Using latency data we gathered
from PlanetLab, we simulated Alibi Routing with different

inequality values (δ from Eq. (1)). Figure 4 shows the frac-
tion of source-destination pairs of PlanetLab nodes for which
(from bottom to top):
(1) There is no target region whatsoever. This happens infre-
quently, and with greater values of δ; it reﬂects the instances
in which the source and/or destinations are simply too close
to the forbidden region to obtain proof (we do not include in
our evaluation instances where s or d are inside F ).
(2) There are no hosts within the target region. This would
improve with a more geographically diverse deployment, yet
even with our 425-node PlanetLab dataset, we ﬁnd these
numbers to be encouraging.
(3) There is no safe path to the target region. This, too would
improve with a more geographically diverse deployment.
(4) The source-destination pair does not need a relay to be
able to communicate while provably avoiding the forbid-
den region (i.e., the source is in the target region). This is
rather common in our dataset, and corresponds to instances
wherein both source and destination are far from the for-
bidden region (for example, two hosts on the same subnet
obtaining sub-millisecond latencies would not need to use a
third party relay to ensure they are avoiding someone thou-
sands of miles away).
(5) An alibi relay is necessary and Alibi Routing succeeds in
ﬁnding one. Finally, we see the fraction of hosts who need an
alibi, and for whom Alibi Routing would be able to deliver
one. This value generally increases with larger values of δ:
when avoiding China, for instance, Alibi Routing would be
able to locate alibis for roughly 80% of source-destination
