I am working on a script to automate the packaging and distribution of a custom Python module to a remote machine. I am currently using `pip` and have created a `setup.py` file. However, I need to use the `subprocess` module to call the `python setup.py sdist` command.

I have explored the `run_setup` method in `distutils.core`, but I would prefer to avoid using the `subprocess` module altogether. It seems unnecessary to open a shell to run a Python command when I am already in a Python environment.

Is there a way to import the `distutils` module into my script and pass the setup information directly to one of its methods, thereby avoiding the use of a shell command entirely? Or are there any other suggestions that might help me achieve this?

Thank you.

If you don't have a specific reason to avoid using subprocesses (such as lack of platform support), it may be simpler to continue using the `subprocess` module. However, if you still prefer to avoid it, there are alternative approaches, though they come with their own challenges, such as handling exceptions and error reporting.

One approach is to use the `setuptools` or `distutils` modules directly within your script. You can import the necessary functions and classes from these modules and invoke them programmatically. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might do this:

```python
from distutils.core import run_setup

# Load the setup configuration
setup_script = 'setup.py'
distribution = run_setup(setup_script)

# Create the source distribution
distribution.run_command('sdist')
```

This code will execute the `setup.py` script and run the `sdist` command without invoking a subprocess. However, be aware that this approach may not cover all edge cases and might require additional error handling and logging.

Alternatively, you can use `setuptools` and its `setup` function directly in your script:

```python
from setuptools import setup

# Define your setup parameters
setup(
    name='your_module_name',
    version='0.1',
    packages=['your_package'],
    # Add other setup parameters as needed
)

# To create the source distribution
from setuptools.command.sdist import sdist
command = sdist(dist=True)
command.initialize_options()
command.finalize_options()
command.run()
```

This method allows you to define and execute the setup process entirely within your script, avoiding the need for external shell commands.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
