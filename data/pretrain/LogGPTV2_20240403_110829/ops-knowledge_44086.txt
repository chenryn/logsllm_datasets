User: How to use the ELK technology stack to analyze and monitor application logs?
Assistant: The ELK technology stack consists of three open source tools: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Use these three tools in combination to analyze and monitor application logs: 1. Use Logstash to collect and parse logs. Logstash is a data collection engine that can receive log data from different sources, parse and transform it. Logstash can be configured to collect log data from applications, parse the logs, and then send the logs to Elasticsearch for storage. 2. Use Elasticsearch for storage and search. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analysis engine for storing and searching large amounts of log data. Log data is passed from Logstash to Elasticsearch for storage. Fast search and analysis can be done using Elasticsearch. 3. Use Kibana for data visualization. Kibana is a web-based visualization tool for building and displaying data charts and dashboards. It can read data from Elasticsearch and convert it into charts, dashboards, etc. for presentation. You can use Kibana to analyze application behavior, problems, performance, and more based on log data. By using these tools in combination, real-time monitoring and analysis of application logs can be realized, so that problems can be found and resolved in time.
