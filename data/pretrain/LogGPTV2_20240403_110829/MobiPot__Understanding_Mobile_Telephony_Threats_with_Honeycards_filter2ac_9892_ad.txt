We seeded mal1 and mal2 four times on diﬀerent dates (see
Table 1 and green bars on x-axis on Figure 3(b), 3(e), 3(h)
and 3(k). In Table 2(a), we use the ﬁrst seeding date as a
reference point to calculate the statistical signiﬁcance.
From Table 2(a) we notice that there is no signiﬁcant ef-
fect of seeding on the dirtiness of mal1. However, we do
see a statistical diﬀerence on the number of messages re-
ceived when mal2 was seeded. We also tested all four time
periods for computing the statistical signiﬁcance level; how-
ever do not see any diﬀerence and found the same results.
There is a sudden rise in the number of unsolicited calls for
mal1 (see Figure 3(b)) and unsolicited messages for mal2 (see
Figure3(e)) after the second round of seeding. As discussed
in Section 3.1.2, the second and third rounds of seeding were
more eﬀective as we found more recent malicious set of ap-
plications which leaked the phone numbers to the Internet.
mal1 received a total of 81 messages from two sources,
out of which 79 were from 106588302. All of these mes-
sages were advertisement messages with no URL links in
them. The other two messages were from 10690123590110
and have a URL in it http://wap.guanxi.me. Apparently,
these two messages appeared on the same date when mal1
was seeded the ﬁrst time (see Figure 3(h)). We believe that
this was the result of our seeding exercise and some ap-
plication did leak our honeycards. Interestingly, we found
that mal2 also received the same messages from a diﬀerent
sender 1065502004955590110 on the same date when mal2
was seeded the ﬁrst time. We believe the two source numbers
are spoofed and owned by the same attacker. Our eﬀorts
7http://www.xhqm.cn/
show some early insights on seeding honeycards privately
through malicious applications. This serves as the second
sign of our successful seeding exercises. We also found that
there is a clear tendency to signiﬁcance (p = 0.059) be-
tween the total number of messages before and after mal2
was seeded the ﬁrst time.
4.4.3 Abuse on abs1 and abs2
The third and ﬁnal seeding exercise was performed us-
ing abs1 and abs2, where these two honeycards were seeded
directly by contacting the known abuse phone numbers. Fig-
ure 3(c) and 3(f) show the total (cumulative) call and SMS
message volume before and after seeding dates. Note that
unlike other seeded honeycards, abs1 and abs2 were seeded
at diﬀerent times.
As it can be noticed from both ﬁgures that there has been
a noticeable increase in the number of calls and messages on
both abs1 and abs2. We believe that the more noticeable
increase in abs1 and abs2 are characteristics of the seeding
methodology of calling and sending SMS messages to num-
bers on the abuse list, in that the call and SMS messages
most likely attracted human attention immediately since it
requires human interaction with the attacker. Note that the
increase in volume for abs1 and abs2 applies to benign SMS
messages and calls as well.
We used only the ﬁrst seeding date as a reference to gen-
erate population before and after seeding, and use Mann-
Whitney to compute the statistical signiﬁcance. We found
that there is a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
number of calls received by abs1 before and after seeding
(p = 0.0). On the other hand, we only found a margin at
the edge of signiﬁcance for messages and calls received by
abs2 before and after seeding (p = 0.061 and 0.068 respec-
tively). We also found that the total number of senders
in abs2 and total number of callers in abs1 be statistically
higher after seeding (p = 0.048 and p = 0.049, respectively).
Immediately after seeding on both dates, there were many
fraudulent transaction messages received by abs1 and abs2.
Some examples of these messages (translated in English and
masked for privacy) are
• ICBC: 62122640000XXXXXXXX; Account: account-
ing Liping; received, please return!
• Conﬁrmed Kazakhstan, also grew a position of waiting
before QQ news, I just called and asked, and transfers
it to me. The ﬁfth branch of the Sichuan branch of
China Construction Bank 52409438XXXXXXXX.
• Agricultural Bank; number: 62284801208XXXXXXXX;
Beneﬁciary: Lu Yudan; Longgang, Pingshan Branch,
Shenzhen Branch
Moreover, there were a lot of calls and SMS messages from
legitimate users to verify our identity, e.g., in asking whether
we know each other (see Figure 3(c) and 3(f)). We believe
this happened because these (legitimate) peers had their
phone numbers listed on the dedicated sites of telephony
abuse lists. Following are possible reasons of having these
numbers listed on the abuse lists: (a) an adversary spoofed
legitimate users’ phone numbers and reached out to other
people; (b) their mobile phones were infected by malware
that used the phones as a bridge (e.g., to send malicious
messages without notifying the user); (c) their telephone
numbers were previously employed by a malicious actor; and
730(d) an adversary voluntarily published the number in form
of a complaint.
4.5 Classiﬁcation of Threats
We perform some simple classiﬁcation on the unsolicited
SMS messages and calls, and show our results in Table 3.
We ﬁnd that most unsolicited SMS messages are spam with
fewer than 10% being scam messages. On the other hand,
scams and spam contribute about equal share in unsolicited
calls. We believe this is a sign that attackers ﬁnd it more
eﬀective to scam victims by calling. Another interesting
ﬁnding is the use of URL in unsolicited SMS messages. It
has been very eﬀective to scam victims.

The results of categorization into human calls and robo-
calls are also interesting. We found a signiﬁcantly bigger
share of spamming attacks be robocalls (63 against 19),
while scam calls have a more equal share between human
calls and robocalls (44 and 37, respectively). This seems to
be intuitive as scams probably requires higher sophistication
in terms of social engineering and phishing, and will have
higher success rate when it is conducted by human beings.
There are more than 50% of the unsolicited calls that are
classiﬁed as others, which include a large number of robocalls
with limited or no conversations.
4.6 Hot Sources
Table 4 shows the biggest contributors of the unsolicited
SMS messages and calls. As expected, these SMS messages
are mostly spam with URL and advertisements.
Interest-
ingly, the senders of the SMS messages are either the service
provider itself (10086 is the number of China Mobile) or SMS
gateways (services oﬀered by the mobile service provider
with a preﬁx of 106).
It appears that attackers use such
services to reach out to a large number of victims in a con-
venient and low-cost way, and the mobile service provider
does not stop such spamming with its services. One ex-
ample is 106558000623, a marketing content provider called
Brisk Hayat8, which broadcasted 193 messages advertising
subscription services.
The top contributor to unsolicited calls is from a landline
number in Guangzhou, the third largest city in China. This
number has been reported to various abuse lists, and the
content of the call is mostly investment invitation into stock
market and companies.
All mobile calling numbers were from China, with the ex-
ception of four foreign-looking numbers. We validated our

results by performing HLR lookups and querying the SS7
signaling network with Number Portability Lookup [4]. We
conﬁrmed that only one of these (+6698240898) was an in-
ternational number registered with a sim-card in Thailand.
Even though the other three numbers pretended to be US
based (i.e., starting with +1), they were actually invalid num-
bers likely spoofed by the attackers to avoid easy detection.
All these international-looking mobile numbers were fraud-
ulent callers/senders, e.g., a fake provider extorting money
with a pretext of contract expiration or a fake postal service
requesting a fee to release a parcel retained in customs.
4.7 Campaigns Detection
In this section, we dig deeper into the SMS message con-
tent in hope of revealing connectivity among various SMS
senders. We believe that attackers are typically using multi-
ple mobile numbers to send out SMS messages due to, e.g.,
maximum number of free SMS messages each simcard could
send and to remain low proﬁle to avoid detection. Here
we exploit similarities among the SMS messages to detect
senders that are part of the same campaign and, conse-
quently, which honeycards they target.
Our analysis starts with splitting a message α to form a
set of words Rα (see Figure 4 for the pseudo code). We then
create a graph where the nodes represent the messages and
an edge between two nodes denotes that there is similarity
(in terms of Jaccard similarity index between corresponding
two sets of words) between the two messages. Finally, we use
the Leading Eigenvector community detection algorithm [26]
to ﬁnd clusters, which are the campaigns detected.
With the set of sources that form a campaign and tar-
get one or more honeycards detected, we present the results
in another graph as shown in Figure 5. In this graph, the
bigger nodes represent honeycards and the smaller nodes
represent various campaigns detected using the algorithm
shown above, with the number inside a small node repre-
senting the total number of sources in that campaign. An
edge between a campaign node and a honeycard node indi-
cates that a subset of sources of the campaign targeted the
honeycard. An edge between two campaign nodes denotes
that there are common sources between the two campaigns.
From Figure 5, we notice:
• There are multiple campaigns targeting a particular
honeycard (e.g., ﬁve campaigns targeting explicitly soc1).
• There are multiple sources which are part of the same
