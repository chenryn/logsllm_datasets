Question: A web server does not specify the character encoding in use, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Why does the unspecified character encoding increase the risk of security issues such as XSS attacks?
"A": "The browser defaults to the most secure character encoding, which may not match the server's encoding, leading to a misinterpretation of the input.",
"B": "Without specifying the character encoding, the server cannot determine which characters are special, creating an opportunity for alternative encodings of special characters to be executed by the browser.",
"C": "Unspecified character encoding leads to the server automatically rejecting all input containing characters above ASCII value 128, causing a denial of service.",
"D": "Browsers are unable to render any characters above ASCII value 128, resulting in a loss of data integrity for the web application."
Answer: B
