A HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Election day was November 3, 2020, but the results of the election
were significantly delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic as states
continued to receive mail-in votes and count ballots in subsequent
days [13]. During this time, Trump and his campaign maintained
that there was widespread voter fraud [82]. Most major news outlets
declared the results — that Biden had obtained enough electoral
votes to defeat Trump — on November 7 [46]. Sparked by a speech
from Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in which he continued
to falsely claim that he had won the election, thousands of his
supporters marched to the U.S. Capitol complex, where Congress
IMC ’21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Eric Zeng, Miranda Wei, Theo Gregersen, Tadayoshi Kohno, Franziska Roesner
had assembled to certify the electoral result [88]. The storming
of the Capitol resulted in over 140 injuries [77] and 5 deaths [22].
The certification was completed the next day and President Biden’s
inauguration was held on January 20, 2021.
On November 3, elections were also held for seats in the Senate
and House of Representatives. In state and local politics, elections
were held for 13 governorships in 11 states and 2 territories, as well
as for state legislative chambers, attorneys generals, state supreme
court seats, and various referendums and ballot measures. In the
state of Georgia, no Senate candidates received a majority of the
vote during the first round, leading to a run-off election on January
5, 2021.
B TEXT CLUSTERING EXPERIMENTS
To qualitatively categorize the overall dataset, we used topic mod-
eling and text clustering algorithms to group ads with similar con-
tent, and then created qualitative descriptions for each grouping
via term frequency evaluation and manual labeling. The short-
content, low-context nature of many of ads in the dataset most
closely aligns with short-text topic modeling problems [1, 16, 65],
however prior work on topic modeling advertisement text specif-
ically is minimal [35]. As such, we pursued several diverse ap-
proaches to the NLP pipeline. For tokenization and lemmatization,
we experimented with three pre-processing models: NLTK [48],
Stanford NLP Group’s Stanza [64], and DistilBERT [76]. Our pre-
processing filtered on NLTK’s english stopword corpus 4 along
with several OCR artifacts such as "sponsoredsponsored." For topic
generation, we experimented with several models and techniques:
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [10, 37], Gibbs-Sampling Dirichlet
Mixture Model (GSDMM) 5 [94], DistilBERT + K-means Cluster-
ing [5, 76], and BERTopic [32]. We tested two implementations of
LDA: Scikit-learn [62] and Gensim [68] with both Stanza and NLTK
pre-processing. The selection of LDA parameter values to evaluate
was based on results from Hoffman et al. [37]. The GSDMM model
was tested on parameter values following suggestions from Yin and
Wang [94] for both Stanza and GSDMM pre-processing as well. The
DistilBERT model and DistilBERT pre-processing, implemented via
Huggingface [92], were used to generate feature vectors for use
by K-means clustering via Sklearn [62], which was tested on topic
count. Lastly, BERTopic was tested on topic count as well.
To establish an approximate baseline for topic cardinality tun-
ing and evaluation on the full deduplicated dataset, we manually
labeled 2,583 unique randomly-sampled advertisements from the
dataset (1.52% of the deduplicated ads), using a list of verticals that
Google Adwords provides to publishers for targeting purposes [29]
(e.g. “/Shopping”, “/Shopping/Apparel”, “/Shopping/Apparel/Men’s
Clothing”). For each ad we used the most descriptive label, but later
collapsed the hierarchies to the second level to form larger groups.
This process produced 171 unique label groups in the sample, which
served as reference for topic count selection and as test data for
evaluation. After generating topics for the full deduplicated dataset,
the subset of ads corresponding to those labeled manually were iso-
lated for similarity evaluation, assuming that a good model would
roughly place ads in the same product sector in the same group.
