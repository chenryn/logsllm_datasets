User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is this server hacked or just login attempts ? See log Can someone tell what does this mean? I tried a command like lastb to see last user logins and I see some strange logins from China (server is EU, I am in EU). I was wondering if these could be login attempts or successfull logins? 

These seem to be very old and usually I lock port 22 to my IPs only, I think I had the port open for a while, last log is in July.

Assistant: lastb only shows login failures. Use last to see successful logins.
