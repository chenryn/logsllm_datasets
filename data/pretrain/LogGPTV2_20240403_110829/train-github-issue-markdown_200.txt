##### Description of the problem
When loading the animated handsWithPlane.gltf file found here:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dvprkyj2ly782jn/AABLjwQLiOSWfr2VDdtlzjYCa?dl=0
The plane, which should not be animated, seems to be taking animation values
from the hands, even though the plane is not attached to any skeleton.

There are two additional test models in the folder, which are isolated
versions of the animated hand and non-animated plane.
