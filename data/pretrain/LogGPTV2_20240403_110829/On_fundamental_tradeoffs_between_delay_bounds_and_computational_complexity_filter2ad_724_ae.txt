Compared to Theorem 1 and 3, Theorem 4 allows for a
much stronger computational model. However, it has to
enforce a slightly stronger type of delay (disadvantage delay)
than GPS-relative delay to maintain the same lower bounds.
Nevertheless, the overall result of Theorem 4 is provably
stronger than that of Theorem 1 and 3, shown next.
Theorem 5. If a scheduler assures O(na) GPS-relative
delay bound using only comparisons between inputs (equiva-
lently GPS virtual ﬁnish times), it also necessarily assures
O(na) disadvantage delay bound.
Proof. Proof of Lemma 4 can be adapted to show that
among {Tj}1≤j≤i−1 there can be no more than Kna + 2
packets that are longer than Ti. So the disadvantage delay
of Ti is no more than (Kna + 2) Lmax
, which is O(na).

We conclude this section by the following conjecture that
was the initial goal of this work.
Conjecture 1. The complexity lower bound for a schedul-
ing algorithm to achieve a delay bound of O(1), under the
decision tree model that allows linear tests, is Ω(log2n) per
packet. A stronger result would be to generalize it further to
the case of O(na) (0 < a < 1) delay bound.
5. LINKING GPS-RELATIVE DELAY
WITH END-TO-END DELAY
In the previous two sections, we obtain complexity lower
bounds for achieving O(na) (0 ≤ a < 1) GPS-relative or
disadvantage delay bounds. However, it is more interesting
to derive complexity lower bounds for scheduling algorithms
that provide end-to-end delay bounds. In this section, we
show that our lower bound complexity results can indeed
be put into the context of providing tight end-to-end delay
bounds. This is done by studying the relationship between
the GPS-relative delay and the end-to-end delay.
In [15], Stiliadis and Varma deﬁned a general class of la-
tency rate (LR) schedulers (called servers in [15]) capable
of describing the worst-case behavior of numerous schedul-
ing algorithms. From the viewpoint of a session i, any LR
scheduler is characterized by two parameters: latency bound
Θi and minimum guaranteed rate ri. We further assume
that the j’th busy period of session i starts at time τ . Let
Wi,j(τ, t) denote the total service provided to packets in ses-
sion i that arrive after time τ and until time t by the sched-
uler. A scheduler S belongs to the class LR if for all times
t after time τ and until the packets that arrived during this
period are serviced,
Wi,j(τ, t) ≥ max(0, ri(t − τ − Θi))
(7)
It has been shown that, for a large class of LR schedulers (in-
cluding W F Q [12], F F Q [14], V C [20], W F 2Q [2], W F 2Q+
[3]), the latency bound of session i, denoted as Θi, is
