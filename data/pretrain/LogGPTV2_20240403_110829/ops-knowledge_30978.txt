User: When you are deploying an Apache web server, how to choose the Apache modules you need to install and how to configure them correctly?
Assistant: The modules you choose to install when deploying the Apache web server depend on your needs, which may include SSL encryption, dynamic content generation (such as PHP or Perl), page compression, access control, and more. Most Linux distributions provide a default Apache package that contains commonly used modules. To correctly configure Apache, you need to understand the relevant configuration files in detail, such as httpd.conf and apache2.conf. You need to know how to modify these files and how to set options for virtual hosting, logging, caching, etc. You also need to consider performance optimization configurations such as worker processes/threads and KeepAlive options. It is recommended that you do proper research and testing before deploying Apache to ensure that you have selected the correct modules and configured them correctly to ensure that your web server can run stably under high load.
