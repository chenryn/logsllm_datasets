User: I have a couple versions of python on my box. My app uses python 2.7 which is found in /usr/local/bin/python. Apache seems to be using an earlier version in /usr/bin/python. How can I configure Apache to use a later version of Python for my app?
Assistant: You can't. Either rebuild mod_wsgi against the other version of Python, or change the shebang line in your CGI scripts to the other executable.
