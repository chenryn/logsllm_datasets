# Sputnik-II Economical Multi-Band Antenna
## Version 2.0 — 04-01-2010

### Bands
| Band | A (inches) | B (inches) | C (inches) | D (inches) |
|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 2m – 1.25m – 70cm | 19 ½ | 1 | 12 ⅜ | 21 |
| 2m – 70cm | 19 ½ | 1 | 6 | 21 |

### Antenna Versions
The Sputnik-II antenna was initially designed to cover the 2m, 1.25m, and 70cm bands in a single ground plane unit. The design uses two radiator elements: the longer element functions as a ¼ wavelength at 2m and a ¾ wavelength at 70cm, while the shorter element is ¼ wavelength at 1.25m and ½ wavelength at 70cm. This configuration directs energy on the 70cm band to the more efficient ¾ wavelength element.

#### ¾ Wavelength Considerations
¾ wavelength antennas are not ideal for ground-to-ground communication due to the large lobe emitted at a 45-degree angle upwards. This characteristic may be beneficial for stations using a repeater at the base of a mountain or for knife-edge DX stations in mountainous areas. The sky wave lobes provide approximately 4dB additional gain over the ground wave on this band.

#### Dual-Band 2m – 70cm Configuration
If 1.25m operation is not required, the antenna can be constructed as a 2m – 70cm dual-band antenna, which offers better ground wave performance. In this version, the shorter element is ¼ wavelength at 70cm. This configuration results in a slight gain increase in the elevation plane in the direction of the shorter stub, with an approximately omnidirectional azimuth pattern. Refer to the Dual-Band 2m – 70cm Elevation and SWR Charts for more details.

### Construction Instructions
1. **Bend Radiator Element**: Bend the radiator element into a "J" shape according to the dimension chart for the desired bands. Add an extra ½” – 1” to segments A and C to allow for trimming for optimal SWR.
2. **Drill Holes in PVC End Cap**: Drill two ⅛” holes adjacent to each other, ½” from the top center of the end cap. Measure 1” from the top of the end cap down the side and draw a line around the circumference. Drill four 3/32” holes, 90 degrees apart, and 45 degrees apart from the radiator element holes.
3. **Fit Radiator Element**: Dry fit the radiator element into the end cap. If the spacing is too tight, bend a slight "V" shape into the center of segment B.
4. **Solder Center Conductor**: Pre-tin the center of segment B with a high-wattage soldering iron or solder gun. Solder the center conductor of the SO-239 connector to the center point of segment B, ensuring the mounting holes are 45 degrees to segment B. Apply epoxy for weather protection and stability.
5. **Insert Ground Plane Rods**: Insert the ground plane rods into the side holes in the end cap. Bend the ends 90 degrees and tin them individually. Pull the rods towards the outer edge after cooling.
6. **Secure Radiator and Ground Plane**: Insert the radiator into the end cap and pull it with pliers to bring the connector into the PVC housing. Position the radials through the SO-239 mounting holes and bend them 90 degrees outwards. Solder the radials to the SO-239, taking care not to melt the plastic dielectric.
7. **Apply Epoxy**: Apply a liberal coating of epoxy to the interior of the end cap to secure the radiator and ground plane. If space is limited, apply the epoxy to the exterior.
8. **Connect Coaxial Cable**: Construct or purchase a pre-made jumper cable. RG-58 is recommended for installations up to 25 feet, and RG-8 for longer distances. Connect the cable to the SO-239 and mount the assembly on the PVC pipe. Do not glue the end cap to the pipe to allow for maintenance.
9. **Trim Radials**: Bend the radials approximately 45 degrees downwards and trim to the length listed for segment D.

### Tuning
#### Tri-Band 2m – 1.25m – 70cm
1. **Longer Element (2m and 70cm)**: Set the radio to 147 MHz and trim ⅛” at a time from the end of the longer element until the SWR is lowest. Check for acceptable SWR at 442.5 MHz.
2. **Shorter Element (1.25m)**: Tune the shorter element for 223 MHz by trimming ⅛” at a time from the end. Trim only the shorter element.

#### Dual-Band 2m – 70cm
1. **Longer Element (2m and 70cm)**: Follow the same tuning process as the tri-band version.
2. **Shorter Element (70cm)**: Tune the shorter element to 445 MHz. Note that trimming the shorter element will have less visible effect as both elements are resonant at 70cm.

A return loss bridge can be used for tuning if available.
