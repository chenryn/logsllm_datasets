Antenna Versions: 
The antenna was originally designed to cover 2m – 1.25m – 70cm in a single ground plane style 
unit. The design utilizes 2 elements for the radiator, the longer of which operates as a ¼ wave at 
2m and a ¾ wave at 70cm. The short element is ¼ wavelength at 1.25m which is also a ½ wave 
at 70cm and appears to be a short, directing the energy on 70cm to the more attractive ¾ wave 
element. 
¾ wavelength antennas however are not very desirable for ground to ground use because of the 
large lobe emitted 45 degrees upwards. This trait may be desirable for stations trying to use a 
repeater at the base of the mountain it is located on or for knife edging DX stations in a 
mountainous region. The sky wave lobes have approximately 4dB additional gain above the 
ground wave on this band. 
If 1.25m operation is not desired the antenna may be constructed as a 2m – 70cm Dual-Band 
antenna which has better ground wave performance, by making the shorter element a ¼ wave 
on 70cm. A slight gain increase is noted on the elevation plane in the direction of the shorter 
stub in this version; the azimuth pattern is approximately Omni-directional. Please refer to Dual-
Band 2m – 70cm Elevation and SWR Charts later in this document. 
Bronze welding rod is used as the elements because that was readily available at the hardware 
store visited during construction of the prototype antenna. Electrical performance will be 
increased if copper or brass rods 36” in length are obtainable.

Construction: 
Bend Radiator element into “J” shape according to dimension chart for bands desired. Add an 
extra ½” – 1” to the dimensions of segments A and C to facilitate trimming for best SWR at 
target frequencies if desired. 
Drill 2, ⅛” holes in PVC end cap to facilitate Radiator element. The holes should be adjacent to 
each other spaced ½” from top center of the end cap.  
Measure 1” from the top of the end cap down the side and draw a line around the circumference 
of the end cap. Drill 4, 3/32” holes, 90 degrees apart from each other and 45 degrees apart from 
Radiator element holes. 
Dry fit the radiator element into end cap. If spacing is too tight because of segment B, bend a 
slight “V” shape into the center of segment B with pliers or a vice.  
Pre-tin center of segment B with high wattage soldering iron or solder gun.  Solder center 
conductor of the SO-239 connector to the center point of Radiator segment B. Be careful not to 
melt plastic dielectric of SO-239. Solder in a way that the mounting holes of the connector are 
45 degrees to segment B of the Radiator to facilitate Ground Plane connection. A coating of JB 
weld or equivalent epoxy may be added to protect this connection from the weather and add 
stability. 
Insert Ground Plane rods into the side holes in end cap. Using needle nose pliers, bend the 
ground rods ¼ - ⅜” from the end 90 degrees. Push each rod towards center of end cap and tin 
with solder individually so that the PVC does not melt. Pull rods towards outer of cap after 
cooled.  
Insert the Radiator into end cap. Pull Radiator elements 1 at a time with pliers to bring connector 
into PVC housing. Position the ends of the radials so that they go through the SO-239 mounting 
holes. Continue pulling radiators so that SO-239 sits flush with Ground Plane radials.  
Bend the radials now coming through the holes in the SO-239 an additional 90 degrees 
outwards from the connector, this makes a better physical connection and it makes room for the 
PL-259 when attached. Solder Ground Plane radials to SO-239, take care not to melt the plastic 
dielectric of the connector or touch the PVC end cap. 
Apply a liberal coating of JB weld to the interior of the end cap to secure Radiator and Ground 
Plane to housing and allow it to dry, if there is not enough room to get at the Radiator the epoxy 
may be added to the exterior of the end cap instead. 
Construct or purchase a pre-made jumper cable from the desired coax and connector types. 
RG-58 is recommended for installations 25’ or less from the antenna. RG-8 type should be used 
for distances exceeding this. Connect cable to SO-239 and mount assembly on PVC pipe. Do 
not glue the end cap to pipe to allow coax maintenance if necessary. 
Bend the radials approximately 45 degrees downwards and trim to length listed for segment D. 
Tri-Band 2m – 1.25m – 70cm Antenna Construction Prototype: 
Tri-Band 2m – 1.25m – 70cm Tuning: 
Attach a watt meter between the transmitter and antenna. The long element of the Radiator is 
for 2m and 70cm. Set radio for 147 MHz, Trim ⅛” at a time from the end of the longer element 
until the SWR is lowest. A small overshoot is acceptable. Do not trim the longer element any 
further. As the longer element is also a ¾ wave on 70cm, check for acceptable SWR on 442.5 
MHz. 
Tune the shorter element for 223 MHz by trimming ⅛” at a time from the end. Trim the shorter 
element only, do not trim the longer element any further when tuning the higher frequency. 
Dual-Band 2m – 70cm Tuning: 
Tuning is the same as the Tri-band version for the longer element; however the shorter element 
on this antenna is tuned to 445 MHz instead. It should be noted that trimming the shorter 
element will have less visible effect than tuning the longer element did as both are resonant at 
70cm.  
A return loss bridge may be used for tuning instead of a watt meter if one is available.
