# Channel Popularity Dynamics

## 4.2.2 Popularity Dynamics

Next, we explore how channel ranks change over time. We examine the channel ranks for every 30-minute interval during a representative month. At each time interval, we identify the groups of channels that make up the top 10, 30, and 50 ranks. Ties in ranking are resolved by comparing the total viewing time of the channels. Our analysis over the trace period did not reveal any significant differences between days.

### Figure 6: Channel Popularity Dynamics
- **(a) Viewer Share of Popular Channels**
  - In Figure 6(a), we show the percentage of viewer share for the top-ranked channels on a representative day. The average viewer shares are similar to those shown in Figure 5(a). However, the graph shows significant fluctuations throughout the day. Notably, the popularity of top channels peaks around 8 AM, 3 PM, and 10 PM. This suggests that TV viewing is a "family" activity during these times, where the choice of what to watch is a shared decision among family members (see [35] for a discussion on group decisions in TV viewing).
  - During other times of the day, user interests are more widely distributed across various channels.

- **(b) Degree of Change in Channel Ranks Over a Two-Day Period**
  - To measure the frequency of rank changes, we monitor the channel ranks for every 5-minute interval and calculate the dissimilarity coefficient, \(\xi = 1 - \rho^2\), where \(\rho\) is the Spearman’s rank-order correlation between channels at two time intervals. Spearman’s rank correlation compares the two sets of values by converting each variable to ranks [36]. Kossinets and Watts used this method to quantify the stability of node degree in social networks [37].
  - The dissimilarity coefficient is calculated using:
    \[
    \rho = 1 - \frac{6 \sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}
    \]
    where \(d_i\) is the difference between ranks of the same channel at two time intervals, and \(n\) is the number of channels. The value of \(\xi\) ranges from 0 to 1, measuring the proportion of variance in degree ranks that cannot be predicted from the initial set of ranks.
  - In Figure 6(b), we compare the dissimilarity coefficient between the first 5-minute interval of Day 1 and subsequent intervals. The analysis over the trace period showed no significant differences between days. Typically, a dissimilarity coefficient greater than 0.1 indicates substantial changes in ranks.
  - The figure shows periodic patterns over the two-day period, suggesting repetitive daily rank changes, likely due to scheduled programs. Dissimilarity coefficients increase during low usage hours, indicating significant rank changes during these times, consistent with our findings in Figure 6(a).

## Breakdown of Viewers Across Genres

### Figure 7: Breakdown of Viewers Across Genre Over a Representative Day (Monday)
- **(a) Number of Viewers per Genre**
  - Figure 7(a) shows the aggregate number of viewers across content genres. We count the number of distinct viewers for every 10-minute interval of a representative day. Free content is the most popular throughout the day, except for mid-day and early morning when kids and mixed genres are the most popular, respectively.
  - While all other genres exhibit diurnal patterns, the number of viewers for the kids genre remains relatively steady from early morning to late night.

- **(b) Percentage of Viewer Share per Genre**
  - Figure 7(b) further breaks down the percentage of viewer share for free, mixed, and kids genres, as well as the remaining genres. The percentage of viewer share adds up to 100% at any moment, and the most popular genre changes throughout the day.

## 4.3 Geographical Locality

We now investigate the content locality—the degree to which similar TV programs are watched by users in geographical proximity. We obtained information about the geographical location of users from the IPTV provider.

### 4.3.1 Locality Across Regions
- We first measure the popularity of content genres across 12 regions, which represent a large subset of the country. Figure 8 shows the relative popularity of genres based on the total time watched for each region over a month.
  - The most popular genres are consistent across regions: free, mixed, and kids channels. The correlation coefficient of the relative ranks of genres ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 between any two pairs of regions.
  - Some regions show a higher preference for local channels, with viewing probabilities varying from 1% to 9%. This reflects stronger regional content preferences in some areas. Overall, spatial variations in genre preferences across regions are up to 20%.

### 4.3.2 Locality Across DSLAMs
- To analyze geographical locality at a smaller scale, we investigate the viewing patterns of users in different DSLAMs. For each channel and all 670 DSLAMs, we calculated the ratio of the time spent viewing the corresponding channel against the total viewing time of all online users within the DSLAM.
  - A locality value of 100% indicates homogeneous users, where all online users in a given DSLAM watched the same channel. A locality value of 10% indicates that 10% of the viewing time of online users in the DSLAM was spent on the channel.
  - By comparing the locality values across all DSLAMs, we can examine how users in different DSLAMs deviate from each other. Figure 9 shows the result for the top-ranked channel A, which is of the free genre, based on a 9 PM to 11 PM trace of a representative day. The popularity of the channel varied significantly (10-42%) across DSLAMs, indicating that 42% of the total viewing time of users in one DSLAM was spent on channel A, while in some DSLAMs, only 10% of the total viewing time was spent on channel A. Less popular channels showed smaller variations.

### Figure 10: Probability of Surfing Varies Across the Time of Day and the Popularity of Programs
- **(a) Across the Time of Day**
  - Figure 10(a) shows the probability of surfing varies across the time of day. People tend to surf less when watching popular programs.
- **(b) Across the Program Popularity**
  - Figure 10(b) shows the probability of surfing across the program popularity. The probability of surfing decreases as the program's popularity increases.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the dynamics of channel popularity, viewer behavior, and geographical locality in TV viewing.
