4.2.2 Popularity dynamics
Next, we are interested in knowing to what extent channel
ranks change over time. We examine the channel ranks for
every 30 minute of a representative month period. At each
time interval, we identify the groups of channels that make
up the top 10, 30, and 50 ranks. We break ties in ranking
by comparing the total viewing time of channels. We ran
the analysis over the trace period and did not ﬁnd diﬀer-
ences between days. In Figure 6(a), we show the percentage
of viewer share for the top ranked channels for a represen-
tative day. The average viewer shares are similar to that
shown in Figure 5(a). However, the graph shows signiﬁcant
ﬂuctuations across the day. Interestingly, popularity of top
channels is reinforced around 8AM, 3PM, and 10PM. We
conjecture this is due to the role of TV viewing as a “family”
activity, where what to watch is no longer a single person’s
decision but is shared amongst family members. (See [35] for
a discussion of how group decisions are taken when watching
television.) The user interests are more widely spread across
channels during other times of the day.
Our next question is how frequent channel ranks change.
Compared to the analysis on stability of popularity distri-
bution in Figure 6(a), rank changes indicate the stability
of popularity for individual channels. To measure the vari-
ations in channel ranks, we monitor the channel ranks for
every 5-minute chunk of the trace period and calculate dis-
similarity coeﬃcient for degree ranks ξ = 1 − ρ2, where ρ
is the Spearman’s rank-order correlation between channels
of two time intervals. Spearman’s rank correlation com-
pares the two set of values by converting each variable to
ranks [36]. Kossinets and Watts, in their work to quantify
the stability of node degree in social networks [37], also used
Spearman rank-order correlation as a dissimilarity measure.
In our case, the correlation is calculated,
P
ρ = 1 − 6
d2
i
n(n2 − 1)
,

where di is the diﬀerence between ranks of the same channel
at two time intervals, and n is the number of channels. The
value of ξ varies between 0 and 1 and measures the propor-
tion of variance in degree ranks that cannot be predicted
from the initial set of ranks.
We compare the dissimilarity coeﬃcient between channel
rank snapshots of the ﬁrst 5-minute time interval of Day 1
and the subsequent time intervals. We ran the analysis over
the trace period and did not ﬁnd diﬀerences between days.
In Figure 6(b), we show the result for two representative
days. Typically, a dissimilarity coeﬃcient greater than 0.1
is considered to have substantial change in ranks.
Figure 6(b) shows periodic patterns over the two day pe-
riod, indicating daily rank changes are repetitive. We expect
scheduled programs to cause such periodic pattern. The
dissimilarity coeﬃcients increase at low usage hours, above
0.1. This indicates substantial degree of rank changes dur-
ing those hours, supporting our ﬁnding in Figure 6(a). A

Figure 7: Breakdown of viewers across genre over a representative day (Monday)
detailed look into the set of channels that compose the top
popular list shows that 36, 63 and 90 distinct channels made
the top 10, 30, and 50 ranks over the trace period. Only 1
channel consistently made the top 10 list. Our results sug-
gest that while channel popularity distribution is skewed at
any given moment, the set of channels that compose the
most popular list changes dynamically over the course of a
day.
One possible cause of the short-term focus on particular
channels but long-term diversity of popular channels is that
there are certain genres of programs that are periodically
popular during certain times of the day or week. Also, one-
time events may suddenly become popular for a short pe-
riod of time, for instance, the Academy Awards. To examine
the temporal correlation between popularity and genre, we
show the aggregate number of viewers across content genres
in Figure 7(a). We count the number of distinct viewers for
every 10-minute time interval of a representative day. As
expected, free content is the most popular throughout the
day, except for the mid-day and around dawn when kids
and mixed genres are the number one line up, respectively.
While all other genres show diurnal pattern, the number of
viewers for kids genre are relatively steady from early morn-
ing to late night. Figure 7(b) further shows the percentage
of viewer share for free, mixed, and kids, and the remain-
ing genres. The percentage of viewer share adds up to 100%
at any moment and the most popular genre changes over a
day.
4.3 Geographical locality
We now identify the content locality—the degree to which
similar TV programs are watched by users in geographi-
cal proximity. We obtained information about geographical
location of users from the IPTV provider. Naturally, we
expect people to show more aﬃnity to the local channels
belonging to their own regions. However, it is not clear that
the rest of channels will exhibit similar aﬃnity across dif-
ferent geographical locations. To understand this, we com-
pare the spatial locality of users’ interests at diﬀerent levels
of granularity (regions and DSLAMs) and over genres and
channels.
4.3.1 Locality across regions
We ﬁrst measure which content genres are popular across the
12 regions, which is a large subset of the whole country. Fig-
ure 8 shows the relative popularity of genres (based on the
total time watched) for each region across a month period.
The most popular genres are similar across regions: free,
mixed, and kids channels are consistently popular. The cor-
relation coeﬃcient of the relative ranks of genres ranged from
0.97 to 0.99 between any two pairs of regions. Interestingly,
users in some regions watched more local channels than
those in other regions: viewing probability of local chan-
nels varied widely from 1% to 9%. This reﬂects that pref-
erence towards regional content is stronger in some regions
than in others. Overall, the spatial variations in preference
in genre across regions are up to 20%.

4.3.2 Locality across DSLAMs
To analyze geographical locality at a smaller scale, we in-
vestigate how users in two diﬀerent DSLAMs are similar in
their viewing patterns. As a measure of DSLAM locality,
for each channel and for all 670 DSLAMs, we calculated the
ratio of the time spent on viewing of the corresponding chan-
nel against the total viewing time of all online users within
the DSLAM. The locality value of 100% indicates homoge-
neous users: all online users at a given DSLAM watched the
same channel. The locality value of 10% indicates that 10%
of the viewing time of online users in the DSLAM was spent
on the channel. By comparing the locality value across all
DSLAMs, we may examine how users in diﬀerent DSLAMs
deviate from each other. Figure 9 shows the result for the
top-ranked channel A, which is of free genre, based on a
9PM to 11PM trace of a representative day. Popularity of

Figure 10: Probability of surﬁng varies across the time of day and the popularity of programs
the channel varied largely (10-42%) across DSLAMs. This
means that 42% of total viewing time of the users was spent
on channel A for one DSLAM, while for some DSLAMs only
10% of the total viewing time of online users was spent on
channel A. Less popular channels showed smaller variations.
