### Issue Report

**Apache Airflow Version**: 1.10.10  
**Kubernetes Version (if applicable)**: N/A  
**Environment**: Debian with `pip install airflow`

#### Description of the Issue
I have encountered an issue where some DAGs, which are missing from the source code but still have records in the database, are causing errors after upgrading to Airflow version 1.10.10. Specifically, these DAGs do not have a description field, which is set to `None` by default. The changes introduced in PR #7457 attempt to apply the `len` function to the `None` value, resulting in an error.

#### Expected Behavior
The rendering process should not produce any errors, even if the DAGs are missing from the source code and their description fields are `None`.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Remove a registered DAG from the source code.
2. Observe the error that occurs during the rendering process.

#### Additional Information
No additional information is required at this time.
