**Apache Airflow version** : 1.10.10
**Kubernetes version (if you are using kubernetes)** (use `kubectl version`):
**Environment** :  
Debian with pip install airflow
**What happened** :  
I have some missing DAGs from the source code and it has the record in the
database.  
When I upgrade to v1.10.10, those DAGs don't have the description field, which
is None by default, so the change on this PR, #7457, will return an error
about applying `len` function to None type.
**What you expected to happen** :  
It should not have any error during the rendering.
**How to reproduce it** :  
Remove a registered DAG from the source code. And the error will pop up
**Anything else we need to know** :  
Nope
