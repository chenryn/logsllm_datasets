packets, which will then be dropped. We term this RE loss.
Although we cannot prevent the original packet from being
lost, we may be able to prevent the encoding from using
lost packets and thus reduce or eliminate RE loss. For this,
we must synchronize the sender’s and receiver’s caches. We
consider two general solutions: (1) retransmit lost packets
so that the receiver can decode future packets encoded based
on them, and (2) detect lost packets and prevent the sender
from encoding future packets based on them.
4.1 Loss recovery schemes
Existing RE schemes for wired networks [20] propose to
retransmit lost packets. To detect loss, the receiver can
wait for a packet that it cannot decode and request the
missing packet from the sender or rely on sequence num-
bers assigned by the sender and request retransmissions of
packets with missing sequence numbers. The potential of
a retransmission-based scheme is high: it could oﬀer band-
width savings similar to when there was no loss. However,
a retransmission-based RE scheme will likely waste signiﬁ-
cant additional bandwidth in a high-loss environment such
as cellular networks.
Another solution for reducing the RE loss is to detect and
blacklist lost packets such that they cannot be used in fu-
ture encodings. We consider two detection methods: ack
snooping and informed marking. Ack snooping relies on the
fact that in TCP, all packets correctly received are acknowl-
edged. The scheme requires the sender to monitor all traﬃc
from the receiver and blacklist any packet not acknowledged
after a predetermined interval. Ack snooping quickly de-
tects loss without explicit feedback from the receiver and
can reduce the RE loss rate to 0. However, it can generate
false negatives by mistakenly considering slow packets lost.
Moreover, it does not work with transport protocols that
do not acknowledge received packets such as UDP, which is
common in cellular wireless networks (see Table 1).
In search for a more general loss detection technique, we
propose informed marking, where each receiver signals the
sender whenever it cannot decode a packet due to a missing
packet from its cache. The receiver sends a control packet
with the hash of the missing packet and the sender black-
lists the corresponding packet in its own cache; in future
encodings, the sender ignores repeated content matched to
any blacklisted packet. Informed marking reduces the RE
loss rate to at most the value of network loss. This is be-
cause receivers need to receive one packet that they cannot
decode to be able to notify the sender. Unlike ack snoop-

snooping, and informed marking (IM). In simulations, RE loss is 0 for retransmission and ack snooping and
at most the network loss for informed marking.
ing, informed marking works with any type of traﬃc and
is ﬂexible because it does not introduce feedback overhead
when there is no loss or when lost packets are not used in
the encoding.
We evaluate the beneﬁt of the three loss recovery schemes
in simulation, by computing the bandwidth they save. We
consider an ideal scenario where lost packets are immedi-
ately retransmitted or detected. Table 3 presents the 75th
percentile values for bandwidth savings on the three data
sets. We make two observations. First, all three schemes
perform similarly and are able to remove the eﬀect of loss
rates on bandwidth savings observed when no recovery scheme
is used (Table 2). Second, we obtain similar savings regard-
less of the network loss rate. The results show that it is
more important to prevent senders from encoding based on
lost packets than to retransmit the lost packets; RE loss has
a much bigger eﬀect on the bandwidth savings than network
loss. By eliminating or limiting the RE loss, we are able to
obtain savings similar to when there is no network loss at
all.
Because it is more general and it does not introduce unnec-
essary feedback overhead, we implement informed marking
and deploy it in a real cellular wireless network. We present
the results of the deployment next.
4.2 Deployment of informed marking
In our simulations, receivers react immediately when they
cannot decode a packet and instantaneously notify the senders.
It is possible that, in a real wireless network, by the time a
sender receives a request to blacklist packet A, it has already
encoded another packet with pointers to A. To understand
the extent to which this aﬀects the bandwidth saved, we use
the same experimental run as in Section 3.4.2. In Figure 6,
we show the actual savings with informed marking and the
expected savings (note that the expected savings are smaller
than in Figure 5 due to packet blacklisting). The actual sav-
ings are about 25% smaller than expected.
The diﬀerence between expected savings and actual sav-
ings would be explained if there are many matches between
packets sent very close to each other (i.e. traﬃc has tem-
poral locality). Anand et al. have already shown that, for
enterprise traces, 60-80% of matches are between packets in
10% of the cache. To verify whether such behavior exists in
our data sets, we deﬁne the distance between two packets as
the diﬀerence between their indices in cache. We compute
the median distance for each user and ﬁnd that 75% of all
users have an median distance of at most 5. This means
that half of their packets are encoded using recent packets.

If these recent packets are lost it is diﬃcult to blacklist them
in time to prevent RE loss.
5. CONCLUSIONS
We presented the ﬁrst study on the eﬀectiveness of traﬃc
redundancy elimination in cellular wireless networks. Using
real-world traces from three European and North American
wireless service providers, we showed that the majority of
mobile users sends or receives traﬃc with at least 10% re-
dundant bytes. Yet, this redundancy cannot be exploited
by redundancy elimination (RE) algorithms due to the high
packet losses in cellular networks: even a few losses frustrate
RE and prevent bandwidth savings. We proposed informed
marking, a simple technique that allows RE to quickly de-
tect and avoid lost packets. We evaluated informed marking
both in simulation and in a live network and showed its ef-
fectiveness in reducing the eﬀects of loss.
