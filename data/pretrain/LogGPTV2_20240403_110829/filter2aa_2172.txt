that occurs due to chronic emotional interpersonal stressors on the job 
(Maslach & Leiter, 2016)

Responses to Burnout 
* A research study several other security professionals and I conducted in 2012 showed that security professionals were more 
likely to express burnout through cynicism 
Our responses to burnout are broken up into three key dimensions: 
‚Ä¢ Emotional Exhaustion: the feeling of being emotionally overextended 
and depleted of one‚Äôs emotional resources
‚Ä¢ Cynicism: a negative, overly detached, and indifferent attitude toward 
work*
‚Ä¢ Professional Efficacy: a decline of experienced competence and 
achievement in one‚Äôs work

Burnout Can Impact All Parts of Your Life 
‚Ä¢ Not limited to one area of your life 
‚Ä¢ You are one person with many different 
parts of your life
‚Ä¢ Feeling burnt out in one area of your life 
can lead you to feeling burnt out in other 
areas

Information Classification: General
Burnout in the Security Industry 
‚Ä¢ High levels of mental workload. Must quickly and effectively respond to urgent cyber events, 
maintain hyper-vigilance, and experience high risk and job demands
‚Ä¢ Anticipate cyber-attacks. Perform threat modeling, respond to many different data sources, lead 
incident response, filter out false positives, and manage exhausting and complicated data triage to 
maintain cyber-awareness
‚Ä¢ Shortage in staffing and increase in workload. Shortage of talent and not enough budget or 
priority for headcount.
‚Ä¢ Often struggle to find their place within an organization. Due to the specialized knowledge 
required to work in cybersecurity, research shows that confusing and inefficient reporting 
structures, changing job descriptions, resistance to internal security policies, and the need to 
balance technology and business acumen
‚Ä¢ Work is often not appreciated within the organization. Budgets are not approved, security 
polices are seen as intrusive and time consuming, good work is rarely recognized or rewarded

Taking the First Step to Reduce Burnout
‚Ä¢ Research shows that Social Learning Theory and Self-Efficacy are the most effective way 
to reduce burnout.  
‚Ä¢ This is the belief in your own ability to learn from a situation and control your behaviors to 
achieve a desired result. The more that you learn about yourself and your relationship with 
burnout and your hidden triggers, the better you will be at managing it  
‚Ä¢ Self-efficacy can help manage negative emotions and reactions, which can help you recognize 
and anticipate work related stressors and help reduce burnout symptoms  
‚Ä¢ The situational factors that impact burnout are often short term or fall into the ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Change‚Äù 
bucket  
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs asking you to do the work, but THIS DOES NOT MEAN BURNOUT IS YOUR FAULT

What We Cannot Control 
‚Ä¢ Toxic work environment
‚Ä¢ Lack of support
‚Ä¢ Poor leadership/management 
‚Ä¢ Unsupportive HR
‚Ä¢ Co-workers 
‚Ä¢ Challenges in the security industry
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
What We Can Control
‚Ä¢ Patterns of behaviors
‚Ä¢ How you respond to triggers 
‚Ä¢ How much fears and insecurities affect you 
‚Ä¢ How you define your self-worth
‚Ä¢ Your relationship with your work and your co-workers 
‚Ä¢ Where you place your boundaries and how you 
communicate them
‚Ä¢ Your mental script and narrative

Real World Example:  
Too much work and not enough resources 
You have a backup of scans to perform and systems to audit and not enough time or staff to do them.  
You have already stayed late several times in the past week, and you are feeling overwhelmed by the 
never-ending list.  They must get done but you are feeling increasingly frustrated and overwhelmed.
1. Emotional Exhaustion:  I will stay late and work as hard as I must in order to get this done.  I will 
push myself as hard as I must.  Emotions: Depressed, anxious, approval seeking, sensation 
seeking
2. Cynicism: This is such poor management. I‚Äôm going to work my 9-5pm and if it doesn‚Äôt get done, 
it‚Äôs not my problem.  Emotions: anger, resentment, blaming
3. Professional Efficacy: I used to really enjoy doing this.  I used to feel like I could whip through 
these and like I was awesome at this.  Now I feel bogged down and like whatever I do, it‚Äôs just not 
good enough.  I don‚Äôt even know if I am doing a good job at these anymore.  Emotions: Helpless, 
defeated, frustrated, let down, disappointed
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Emotional Exhaustion: What Motivates to 
Push Yourself So Hard?
‚Ä¢
Stimulation and the feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction that is 
difficult to find in other areas of your life?
‚Ä¢
A desire for approval? To be recognized or praised for their work by 
their managers and coworkers?
‚Ä¢
To be a White Knight? To help and protect an organization and the 
people in it?
‚Ä¢
Personal pride? To be proud of the quality of work your produce?
‚Ä¢
Overachiever? Fear Of Missing Out 
Whatever the reason, by recognizing what drives you to care deeply about your work that you push 
yourself to the limit and beyond, the first step is the recognize why it happens and how it guides your 
sense of self worth.

Information Classification: General
Cynicism: When Was Trust Broken?
‚Ä¢ When was relationship damaged? When did you lose hope?
‚Ä¢ Can that trust be regained?  Do you even want to try to rebuild the relationship? 
‚Ä¢ Are you okay being indifferent with your work and maintaining status quo?
‚Ä¢ Do you feel like your work matters? Do you feel like you matter to your job?
‚Ä¢ Can you let go of the resentment and negativity? 
Cynicism is often the most challenging to overcome because it 
deals with a lost of trust and hope and there are often feelings of 
betrayal or rejection.  It‚Äôs often not that you don‚Äôt care, but that 
you do not feel safe to care or to invest yourself in your work.

Professional Efficacy: When Did You Stop 
Feeling Good Enough?
‚Ä¢ What does success look like? What does failure look like?  What is good enough? What 
does a good employee look like? A good parent? Partner? 
‚Ä¢ Does Imposter Syndrome come into play here?
‚Ä¢ How often do you feel fear or anxiety? How often do you fear losing your job?
‚Ä¢ When was the last time you feel like you were good at something? When was the last 
time you felt valued?
Professional Efficacy can lead to the core of reducing burnout because it is the key to our 
self worth and value and how effective we are at setting boundaries

Suffering, may be anxious and depressed, may use 
unhealthy coping mechanisms 
Realizing we are burnt out, we need help, and that we 
want to be the source and the catalyst for change, start to 
recognize triggers  
Accepting our limitations, communicating our needs, 
setting healthy boundaries, that we feel confident to 
enforce, having solutions and coping strategies
UNDERSTAND
Knowing your self worth and value, finding what brings 
you joy, being able to say no without fear, recognizing the 
triggers and signs of burnout 
RELIEF

Advice and Tips
Know your limits, and your goals, and and how to realistically achieve them. What are your goals, where do you want
to be. Do not overwhelm yourself with all the things you should do. It‚Äôs ok to start small and to have limits. We all have them 
and if we do not know what they are, we ‚Äúshould all over ourselves‚Äù and put ourselves in jeopardy. 
Ask for help. Experts comes in many forms.  Life coaches, therapists, friends, books, etc. Professionals can help identify 
triggers, patterns of behaviors, and can help create goals and establish boundaries. 
Recognize the triggers.  Know your toxic inner critic/outer critic and what triggers a negative response.  You can write it 
down to look for patterns in your behavior. 
Set expectations and get specific about what is being asked of you. Set the bar. Do you need to work 10 hours a day?  
Do you need to work weekends?  Do you need to be everything to everyone? Are their choices you both can make that can 
set boundaries?  The 42% Rule says that 42% of your day should be spent resting or doing something stress-relieving. 
What energizes you?  This goes beyond coping mechanisms or stress relief. Something that makes you feel good about 
yourself, gives you feelings of self-worth, and makes you feel like the awesome person you are.
What do you want? While it it would be nice if the world acted the way it should,  it often does not.  However, it is important 
to have an idea of what you want in life.  What are your goals? What are you working for? What motivates you? Where are 
you going and what will it look like when you get there?  Be sure the celebrate each step along the way.
