### Responsive Intrusion Response Evaluation and Strategies

In the context of security, it is crucial to evaluate and match behaviors before and after an intrusion. Figure 9 illustrates the average optimal semi-real-time response to an intrusion. For a practical solution, the system needs to decide on the appropriate response to an intrusion based on the current state of the network.

### Related Work

Extensive research has been conducted over the past decade on system security, assessment, and evaluation metrics. In this section, we survey the related literature and discuss how EliMet compares to existing solutions.

#### Manual Solutions
Manual solutions, such as FLIPS [15] and SoSMART [23], involve hard-coded IDS alert scoring values and lookup tables for prioritizing alerts. These methods are simple and rapid but lack flexibility and scalability, especially in large-scale networks. They also do not account for all possible alert combinations from IDSes or system vulnerabilities.

#### Automated Approaches
Automated approaches, such as those based on attack tree analyses, aim to capture potential attack paths and compute security metrics [17, 36, 38]. These methods can qualitatively assess the security strength of a network [29, 37] and identify critical assets. However, they often make generic assumptions about network configurations and rarely customize for specific networked systems, leading to inaccurate security measure values.

### EliMet: A Semi-Automated Solution

EliMet is a semi-automated rule-based system that uses (alert, score) mappings to prioritize actions. It combines expert knowledge with real-time observations and minimizes explicit human involvement by asking the operator for informative clarifications. This ensures that the estimated security measure values are realistic and reflect the specific characteristics of the network.

**Key Features of EliMet:**
- **Expert Knowledge Integration:** EliMet passively observes the operator's behavior and actively asks for clarification to ensure accurate security estimates.
- **Scalability and Practicality:** EliMet efficiently handles large-scale and complex networks, making it suitable for real-world settings.
- **Realistic Security Estimates:** The system accurately reflects system-specific security measures, minimizing the need for extensive human input.

### Experimental Results

Our experimental results on a case study of a power control network show that EliMet significantly improves situational awareness and intrusion response capabilities. It provides realistic security measure values and enhances the quality of automated security estimates, thereby improving overall system security.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we presented EliMet, a semi-automated system for intrusion response and security assessment. EliMet integrates expert knowledge and real-time observations to provide accurate and scalable security measures. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing situational awareness and intrusion response in complex, real-world settings.
