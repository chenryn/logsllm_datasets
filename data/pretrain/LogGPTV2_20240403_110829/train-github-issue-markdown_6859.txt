### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version
### What happened
We have a DAG running with a cronjob schedule every 4 minutes that checks
whether there is a new file present in a file system or not. If there is one
available, it lists its path and passes it as a dynamic task via XCOM (one
task = one file).
We have experienced a couple of times already that this task is never started,
nor does it appear in the logs (not in scheduler logs, nor in AKS logs). It
simply disappears and the status of the task is removed.
The DAG has following configurations:  
Schedule interval: "*/4 5-22 * * 1-5"  
Catchup: False  
End Date: None  
Max Active Runs: 1  
Concurrency: 1  
DAG Run Timeout: 0:10:00

### What you think should happen instead
The task should be triggered and started. Instead, it gets the status removed
without any logs or trace
### How to reproduce
This happens in random moments, so exact steps to reproduce are hard to
determine
