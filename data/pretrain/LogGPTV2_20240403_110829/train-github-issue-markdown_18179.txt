This is an issue being there since 2.1.
The FormValidator runs the validation of the underlying object graph in 2
cases:
  * on the root form
  * in case all parents have `cascade_validation` set to `true`
This means that when you have a subform with `mapped` set to `false`, the only
way to have its object graph validation is to enable `cascade_validation` on
all parents of the unmapped field, which will lead to duplicate validation of
the object graph of the parent if it uses `@Assert\Valid()` properly.
As unmapped forms define a new object graph, I think it would make sense to
run the validation on them as well.
