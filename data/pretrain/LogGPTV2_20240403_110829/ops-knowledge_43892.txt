User: I have watch a folder that will create a new sub-folder use date as name(e.g 201105124) everyday. I have start a daemon to watch it but if a new sub-folder added, the event in the new sub-folder cannot be trigger. IS that I need to update the watch for the new folder?
Thx for your answer.
Regards
Roy
Assistant: Yes, you need to use update_watch after directory creation.
