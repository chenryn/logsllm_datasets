### BGPWeekly Dataset

**RIR (Regional Internet Registry):** The BGPWeekly dataset includes the (extended, if available) delegation files from AFRINIC [3], APNIC [5], ARIN [6], LACNIC [36], and RIPE NCC [54] for all days covered in the BGPMonthly dataset.

### Data Sanitation

Before analyzing the BGP data, we remove well-known artifacts. Specifically, we:
1. **Remove Bogon Routes:** These are routes leading to reserved address space [65] or containing ASes currently reserved by IANA [33].
2. **Filter Out Less Specific Prefixes:** We exclude all routes to prefixes less specific than /8 to ensure that only default-free routing information is analyzed.
3. **Eliminate Looped Routes:** Routes with loops in their paths are also removed.

Using the last snapshot of the BGPWeekly dataset as a reference, these sanitation steps removed approximately 3.36 million (0.7%) routes and reduced the number of prefixes from about 1.29 million to around 932,000 (-28%). To avoid making false inferences due to lack of visibility, we only analyze prefixes visible by at least one-third of the BGP monitors on the corresponding date. Our analysis shows a clear separation between locally and globally visible prefixes, regardless of the year (see Appendix § B for more details). This final step further reduced the number of unique prefixes to approximately 803,000.

### Trends in the Use of AS-Path Prepending (ASPP)

Previous studies have reported varying metrics on ASPP, with the most recent results being from 2016 [11, 25, 27, 67]. To better understand ASPP utilization, we analyze its trends over the last decade using the BGPMonthly dataset. It is important to note that our numbers represent lower bounds of actual ASPP utilization due to:
1. **Limited Visibility of Route Collectors:** The visibility of route collectors is limited [16, 29, 47].
2. **Prepended Paths Attractiveness:** Prepended paths tend to be less attractive than non-prepended ones.
3. **Data Sanitation:** We sanitize our data (see § 3).

**One-Third of All ASes Use Origin-Prepending:**
Figure 2 illustrates the fraction of ASes using ASPP (for IPv4) separated by prepending type: origin-prepending or intermediate-prepending. The fraction of ASes using ASPP has increased slightly from about 28% (9.4k) on January 15th, 2010, to about 31.4% (21.6k) on April 15th, 2020, with most ASes using origin-prepending. Similarly, there is a small increase in intermediate prepending, from 4.7% (1.6k) on January 15th, 2010, to 5.5% (3.8k) on April 15th, 2020. The spike in the fraction of ASes applying intermediate prepending corresponds to a period when experiments involving the use of BGP communities to manipulate ASPP were taking place [62].

### AS-Path Prepending Policies

We categorize ASPP policies as follows:
1. **No-Prepend:** No prepending is applied.
2. **Uniform:** All visible routes have the same prepend size \( M \geq 0 \).
3. **Binary:** Visible routes have either prepend size \( M \) or \( N \), where \( M, N \geq 0 \) and \( M \neq N \).
4. **Diverse:** The number of different prepend sizes in the visible routes exceeds two.

**Policy Consistency Over Time:**
Our first focus is on policy consistency—how often does an AS change a prefix prepending policy? Using the BGPContinuous dataset, we identify roughly 2.3 million unique prefix-origin pairs. For each pair, we define the primary policy as the one observed most frequently throughout the full month. Figure 4 shows a heatmap indicating the number of pairs in each cell. We observe a concentration in the top right section, representing 54% of prefix-origin pairs, indicating that they are visible all the time and never change their primary policy. Similar stability was found in another month (September 2019), allowing us to use weekly (BGPWeekly) or monthly (BGPMonthly) snapshots without loss in subsequent analyses.

**Stability and Commonality of Policies:**
Using the BGPWeekly dataset, we examine the use of prepending policies for prefix-origin pairs between January 1st, 2018, and May 4th, 2020. Figure 5 shows that the most common prepending policy is binary, followed by diverse and uniform policies. Their popularity remains largely stable: diverse increased from 4.5% (30k) to 6.1% (50k), binary decreased from 17.2% (114k) to 15.9% (131k), while uniform remained at 3.6% (24.4k to 29.4k). The trend towards more fine-grained policies may be related to increasing AS connectivity levels (e.g., connecting to more IXPs). For comparison, the use of uniform prepending in January 2010 was 2.7% (8.2k). The consistent presence of the uniform policy over time is surprising, as it should not influence remote BGP decisions. We explore this phenomenon further in § 5.3.

**Increased Prepending During COVID-19 Lockdown:**
Between February and April 2020, the number of prefix-origin pairs with ASPP reached approximately 30% (a 4% increase). This peak is likely related to the lockdown measures due to COVID-19, which resulted in people staying at home more [28, 71, 72]. Reports indicate traffic increases during this period [4, 20, 44], leading content providers like Netflix and YouTube to stop streaming in 4K to save bandwidth [31]. The higher use of ASPP during this period was necessary for network operators to handle the increasing demands of traffic while upgrading their links (as ASPP use decreased in May). Network operators confirmed observing more use of ASPP, especially during large live events streamed on YouTube [42], and some transit customers requested capacity upgrades.

### AS-Path Prepending Policies: AS Perspective

We now analyze ASPP policies from the perspective of ASes. When an AS employs a single policy for all prefixes it originates, we classify it as no-prepend, uniform, binary, or diverse. Otherwise, we say the AS employs a mixed set of policies.

**Most ASes Use Multiple Policies:**
Using the BGPWeekly dataset, we analyze the use of AS prepending policies between January 1st, 2018, and May 4th, 2020. More than 30.8% (20.8k) of the ASes prepend at least one prefix they originate, and most ASes use mixed prepending policies. Among those using a single policy, the most common is binary, followed by uniform and diverse. Over time, the fractions of different policies are substantially stable, with only a slight increase in all but binary policies. On May 4th, 2020, the percentages were: uniform 2.5%, diverse 1.4%, mixed 16.4%, and binary 10.4%. The increase in fine-grained prepending policies may be associated with a general increase in AS connectivity.

**Mixed Policy ASes:**
Next, we focus on ASes using a mixed set of policies and analyze the fraction of prefixes using each prepending policy. We group these ASes according to the number of originated prefixes into four bins: 1-10, 11-100, 101-1000, and 1000+ prefixes. For each AS in a bin, we calculate the fraction of prefixes for each policy and present it as a boxplot in Figure 6 for May 4th, 2020 (similar behavior is observed for other snapshots). The plot shows that for ASes employing mixed policies, the most common is the binary policy (in all bins). The fraction of diverse policy increases with the number of prefixes an AS originates, while the fraction of uniformly prepended prefixes decreases with AS size.

### Uniform Prepending

**Widespread Use of Uniform Prepending:**
There is no apparent reason for an AS to use the same prepending size for all its neighbors when originating a prefix, as it implies no differentiation among them. However, on May 4th, 2020, we observe more than 29k (3.6%) uniformly prepended prefix-origin pairs originated by 5.8k (8%) ASes, out of which 1.7k (2.5%) ASes prepend all their prefixes uniformly.

**Consistent Use of Uniform Policy:**
The use of uniform policy might be temporary. To determine whether this is a common case, we selected all 25.8k uniformly prepended prefix-origin pairs on December 31st, 2018, and used the BGPWeekly dataset to show the fractions of policy type changes for these prefixes in the preceding and following months. Figure 7 shows that the total number of prefixes decreases on both sides, as up to 20% of prefixes were not visible earlier or stopped being visible afterward. Both before and after December 31st, 2018, the fractions of no-prepend, binary, and diverse (for this fixed set of prefix-origin pairs) increase, while uniform decreases. In other words, for some of these prefixes, uniform prepending was temporary. However, for the entire period, we see at least some consistent use of the uniform policy.
