**Title: Black Hat US-20: EdTech - The Ultimate APT**

**Abstract:**
This presentation will highlight the significant privacy and harm reduction concerns associated with the implementation of educational technology (EdTech) in schools. By bringing these issues to light, we aim to raise awareness and prompt action from stakeholders. Currently, only those directly involved with young people are concerned, but the long-term implications of implementing EdTech without proper due diligence could have far-reaching negative effects on society.

The talk will focus on the "Trojan horse" effect of EdTech, where seemingly beneficial tools are introduced into educational settings without adequate consideration for privacy and security. We will present evidence of potential and actual harms, including:

1. **Privacy Issues:**
   - Examination of the terms and conditions of popular EdTech platforms and apps.
   - Analysis of data storage practices and the sharing of information without informed consent.
   - Case studies of major providers such as Pearson, BBC, Edulink, and Pixl, highlighting specific privacy vulnerabilities and the risks they pose.

2. **Biometric Data Use:**
   - Discussion of the use of biometrics in schools, including fingerprint payment systems in canteens and facial recognition technologies.
   - Identification of flaws in data storage and the lack of informed consent for the use of biometric data.

3. **Contrast with Educator Tech Skills:**
   - Exploration of the gap between the investment in advanced EdTech and the limited technological skills of educators.
   - Examples of schools where educators lack basic access to working PCs or copiers, yet are expected to manage complex EdTech systems.

4. **Call to Action:**
   - Providing the audience with key questions to ask EdTech vendors and education institutions.
   - Emphasizing the importance of trust in the education system and the need to protect that trust from being eroded by irresponsible EdTech practices.

Education is a rite of passage, and students and families place their trust in the system. It is our duty to ensure that this trust is not abused by poorly implemented EdTech. This talk aims to be a catalyst for change, informing and empowering the audience to take action and advocate for better privacy and security standards in educational technology.
