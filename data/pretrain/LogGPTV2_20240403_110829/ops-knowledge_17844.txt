User:  need to create a new user in the Linux system and grant specific permissions to the user. Please provide detailed steps.
Assistant: In the Linux system, to create a new user and grant the user specific permissions, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Use an account with administrator privileges to log in to the Linux system. 2. Execute the following command to create a new user: ``` sudo adduser username ``` Among them, username is the username you want to create. After executing this command, the system will prompt you to enter the password and other relevant information of the user. 3. Set a password for this user: ``` sudo passwd username ``` This command will let you set a password for this user. 4. Use the following command to grant specific permissions to this user: ``` sudo usermod -aG groupname username ``` where groupname is the name of the group you want to grant to this user, and username is the user you just created. For example, if you want the user to be able to use the sudo command, you can use the following command: ``` sudo usermod -aG sudo username ``` This command adds the user to the sudo group. 5. After the authorization is complete, you can use the following command to test whether the user can use the authorized authority: ``` sudo su - username ``` This command will allow you to switch to the user and run the command with the user's authority. 6. If you want to delete the user, you can use the following command: ``` sudo deluser username ``` This command will delete the user and also delete the user's home directory. If you just want to delete the user's account without deleting their home directory, you can use the following command: ``` sudo deluser --remove-home username ```
