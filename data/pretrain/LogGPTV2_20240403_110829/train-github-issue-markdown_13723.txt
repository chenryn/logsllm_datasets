### Current Behavior:
`npm uninstall --save ` doesn't remove the package version listed in
`package.json` from `package-lock.json` when another version exists.
### Expected Behavior:
For the package version listed in `package.json` to be removed from `package-
lock.json`. Essentially running `npm install --save  && npm uninstall
--save ` should leave `package-lock.json` unchanged.
### Steps To Reproduce:
    npm init --yes
    npm i --save-dev rollpkg
    # rollpkg has a dependency of jest ^26.6.3, which is now in the top level node_modules
    npm i --save-dev jest@26.0.0
    # jest is added to package.json and
    # jest 26.0.0 is now in top level node_modules, 26.6.3 is moved to node_mod/rollpkg/node_mod
    npm uninstall --save-dev jest
    # jest is removed from package.json
    # but node_modules is unchanged
### Environment:
  * OS: MacOS 10.15.7
  * Node: 14.15.0
  * npm: 7.3.0
Thanks for all the great work on npm v7, I'm really enjoying using it!
