title:botconf2015 DGArchive – A deep dive into domain generating malware
An observable trend in recent years of malware development is the increased use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). After having announced the project “DGArchive” in a lightning talk of last year’s Botconf, we would like to follow up with a full talk proposal for this year.The core idea of DGArchive is to create a high-coverage database of DGA domains. On the one hand, this allows time-independent checks on potential DGA domains, on the other hand, blocklists can be derived for network protection.
