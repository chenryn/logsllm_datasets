### Title: Botconf 2015 - DGArchive: A Deep Dive into Domain-Generating Malware

In recent years, a notable trend in malware development has been the increased use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). Following our announcement of the "DGArchive" project in a lightning talk at last year's Botconf, we are pleased to present a full talk proposal for this year.

**Overview:**
The core objective of DGArchive is to create a comprehensive database of DGA-generated domains. This initiative serves two primary purposes:
1. **Time-Independent Verification:** It allows for the validation of potential DGA domains regardless of when they were generated.
2. **Network Protection:** The database can be used to derive blocklists, enhancing network security by preventing access to known malicious domains.

By leveraging DGArchive, cybersecurity professionals and researchers can better understand and mitigate the threats posed by domain-generating malware.
