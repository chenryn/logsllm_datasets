### System Information
- Playwright Version: v1.34
- Programming Language: Java
- Operating System: macOS 12.2
- Browser: Chromium 114.0.5735.133 (Official Build) (arm64)

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch a Chromium instance using Playwright.
2. Navigate to any website (e.g., google.com) or open the Developer Tools.

### Expected Behavior
- The launched site or Developer Tools should open as quickly as they do in a standard Chrome browser.

### Actual Behavior
- Compared to a regular Chrome instance, the page load time is approximately 5 times slower in the Playwright-controlled Chromium instance.
- Additionally, the Developer Tools take an unusually long time to load.

### Notes
- This issue is specific to macOS and does not occur on Windows or Linux.
- I have already deleted the old `ms.playwright` folder from the cache and updated Playwright to version 1.34, but the slowness persists.
