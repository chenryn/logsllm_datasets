User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why are people saying that the X Window System is not secure? Why are people saying that the X Window System is not secure? The OpenBSD team succeeded with privilege separation in 2003; why didn't the "Linux developers" do this?

To be clear: What security design flaws does X have? Why don't the Linux developers separate privileges in X?

Assistant: This is a poorly phrased question.  For instance, it does not define what is meant by &quot;secure&quot;.  That makes it harder to provide a useful answer.
Here are three possible security concerns, and how X11 fares:

Isolation between apps.  X11 does not isolate apps from each other.  If one app is malicious, it can log all keystrokes, tamper with other apps windows, steal the contents of copy/paste buffers, inject keystrokes into other windows, etc.  (Windows has similar security properties.)

Preventing privilege escalation. X11 apps run as a non-root user.  However, on most platforms the X11 drivers run as root, so they can access the display hardware.  This introduces the risk that a malicious app might be able to exploit some security vulnerability in the X11 code and use it to become root.  This is a serious risk, because X11 is a complex system with a tremendous amount of code, and all it takes is one security vulnerability anywhere in that code to make a privilege escalation attack possible.  This is indeed a concern.
The question refers to privilege separating the X11 code.  I do not know how easy or hard this is to do, or how effective OpenBSD's attempt is.  However, the aim of privilege separation is to reduce the likelihood of such privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Enabling remote attacks. If I run X11 on my Linux machine, does that make it easy (or possible) for remote attackers to &quot;hack&quot; my machine?  The answer is no.  Remote attackers have no way to access or talk to X11, so running X11 on my machine does not make my machine insecure.


All in all, I would say that X11 does pose some security risks, but they are relatively minor, compared to the risks you are already accepting when you use any desktop OS.  In the desktop world, every app you run already must be completely trusted (since any one rogue app you run has access to all your files and everything, and can ruin your life); X11 does not make this fact any worse.
Therefore, I would not hesitate to use X11, at least not on security grounds.  If you find X11 useful, go ahead and use it.
