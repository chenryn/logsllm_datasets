When deploying a Java application on Linux, you do not need to install additional third-party libraries, as they are typically provided as JAR files. You only need to update the `CLASSPATH` in your script file. However, Java requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which can be quite large.

Are there any other languages supported by Linux that can achieve similar functionality without requiring a large runtime environment? By default, our servers only support Perl, Python, and Tcl, and GCC is not available.

**Response:**

For deploying applications on Linux, it is generally recommended to use the distribution's native package format (such as DEB for Debian-based systems or RPM for Red Hat-based systems). The package managers included in these distributions can automatically handle dependencies, making the deployment process smoother.

Among the languages supported by your server (Perl, Python, and Tcl), Perl is the most commonly pre-installed on most Linux systems. Python is also very popular and widely used, but it may not be as ubiquitous as Perl. Both Perl and Python have extensive standard libraries and can often be used without needing to install additional packages, making them suitable alternatives to Java for your use case.
