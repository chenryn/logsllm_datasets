User: When deploy java app on linux, we don't need to install anything, all third-party libs are jar files and we only update classpath in script file. But java needs jre which is quite large.
So is there any other language supported by linux can do that? By default our server only support perl/python/tcl, no gcc available, sigh.
Assistant: On Linux you should use the distribution's native package format (DEB, RPM, â€¦) to deploy applications. The package managers included in the distributions can handle dependencies automatically.
Apart from that, I think Perl is the only language that is available in most Linux systems out of the box. Python is very popular, too, but probably not as ubiquitous.
