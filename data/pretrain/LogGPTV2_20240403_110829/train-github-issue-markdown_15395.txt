I am working on solving a large linear system as efficiently as possible, and one of the methods I have been exploring is reordering the matrix using the Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) algorithm. This approach works well for small matrices, but it fails when I scale up to larger sizes, such as a 60,000 x 60,000 matrix.

The code to reproduce this issue is straightforward:

```python
import scipy.sparse.csgraph
import numpy as np

# H is a symmetric 60,000 x 60,000 sparse CSC matrix with about 7 million non-zero elements.
perm = scipy.sparse.csgraph.reverse_cuthill_mckee(H, symmetric_mode=True)
I, J = np.ix_(perm, perm)
H_reordered = H[I, J]
```

When I run the above code, I encounter the following error:

```

```

From my understanding, the issue arises because the reordering process attempts to create a 60,000 x 60,000 NumPy array, which contains approximately 3.6 billion elements. This is too large to be handled by an `int32` data type.

Does anyone know of a workaround or a fix for this problem?
