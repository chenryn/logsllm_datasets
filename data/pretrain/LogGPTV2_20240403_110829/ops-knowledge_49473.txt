User: I couldn't find a way to do this on Mac and Linux.  With Windows one could use ctypes and then use console.SendKeys.  So far as I can tell there is certainly no way that Apple would let a humble user take over the mouse and keyboard, but how might an average Joe do this on Linux?  Despite no findings, I would assume there is some way to do this through an X-server?
Any input, in any programming language, is very welcome
Assistant: Uinput is the definitive, Kernel-guru sanctioned way to do this on Linux.
Thanks to @Reily Grant for the Mac info!
