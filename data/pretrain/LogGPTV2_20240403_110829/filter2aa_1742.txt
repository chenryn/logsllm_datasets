HISTORY OF EMP
• COMPTON EFFECT(H BOMB)
• TESLA COIL 
• MARX GENERATOR
• EXPLOSIVE DEVICE ARMATURE
H BOMB STARFISH
• 1962 US EXPLODED AN H BOOM 800 
MILES FROM OAHU HAWAII
• 30 STRINGS OF STREET LIGHTS WENT 
OUT
• 300 STREET LIGHTS IN ALL
THE MARX GENERATOR
• INVENTED IN 1924
• NOVEL CONCEPT TO CREATE HIGH 
VOLTAGE
• CAPACITORS ARE CHARGED IN 
PARRALL
• CAPACITORS DISCHARGE IN SERIES
PULSE INJECTING
• ELECTRICAL LINES
• TELEPHONE 
• CABLE
• COAXIAL
• NETWORK
• GROUNDING STRAP 
DUMB DIGITAL DEVICES
• SIMPLE DIGITAL DEVICES
• THEY KEEP ON WORKING AFTER 
BEING PULSED
• STAND ALONG SENSORS 
(TEMP,PRESSURE,VOLTAGE)
• A TYPE OF EMP FUZZING
SMART DEVICES PULSED
• THEY REBOOT
• THEY NEED SOME OPERATOR TO 
MANUALLY RESET
• THEY TURN OFF
CONTROLLING A NETWORK OF    
DEVICES
• AS LONG AS YOU KEEP PULSING 
THEY CAN NOT BRING THE NETWORK 
UP
• LINUX,UNIX,SUN,WINDOWS,ROUTERS
FIRE WALL 
• THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REBOOT
MOORES LAW
– EVERY 18 MONTHS THE NUMBER OF 
TRANSITORS DOUBLES THAT CAN BE 
PUT ON A SILCON WAFFER
– DIE SIZE DECREASES
– VOLTAGE DECREASES 
NOT ALL EMP THE SAME
DESIGNER EMP
• PULSE WIDTH
• PULSE RISE TIME
• PULSE  RATE
• HARMONICS
• FREQUENCY
BYZANTINE FAULTS 
• LARGE REALTIME DISTRIBUTED 
SYSTEMS
• BYZANETINE FAULT TOLERANCE AND 
RECOVERY
• N IS THE NUMBER OF PROCESSES
• T IS THE NUMBER OF CORUPTED 
PROCESSES
• A SOLUTION IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF
• N>3T+1 
SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND 
DATA ACQUISITION
• LARGE REALTIME DISTRIBUTED 
SYSTEMS
• CONTROL,CHEMICAL,WATER,OIL, 
POWER SYSTEMS    
• LARGE MIX OF SMART AND DUMB 
DEVICES

FLY BY WIRE
• BOEING THE PILOT  IS IN CONTROL
• AIR BUS THE COMPUTER IS IN 
CONTROL
TWA FLIGHT 800
• 75 MILL JOULES
• CENTER FUEL TANK
• ARTIFACT PULSE ON THE BLACK BOX 
• THE BLACK BOX WOULD SHOW AN 
ARTIFACT OR DAMPED RINGING IF 
THE PLANE WAS PULSED  
½*C*V*V=POWER IN JOULES
• C= CAPACITENCE,V=VOLTAGE
• C=102 MICROFARDS
