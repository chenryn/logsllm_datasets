# Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Injection into Digital Devices

## Introduction
This document explores the history, mechanisms, and effects of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) on digital devices. It covers various aspects including historical events, generation methods, pulse parameters, and the impact on different types of devices and systems.

## History of EMP
### Key Events and Inventions
- **Compton Effect (H-Bomb)**: The Compton effect, discovered in 1923, is a key principle behind the EMP generated by nuclear explosions.
- **Tesla Coil**: Invented by Nikola Tesla, this device can generate high-voltage, high-frequency alternating currents, which can be used to create EMPs.
- **Marx Generator**: Invented in 1924, the Marx generator is a novel concept for creating high voltages. It charges capacitors in parallel and discharges them in series.

### Starfish Prime
- **1962 Event**: The United States conducted a high-altitude nuclear test, known as Starfish Prime, approximately 800 miles from Oahu, Hawaii.
- **Effects**: The EMP caused by the explosion affected electrical systems, including 30 strings of street lights (approximately 300 street lights in total).

## EMP Generation and Parameters
### Marx Generator
- **Invention**: Invented in 1924.
- **Function**: Charges capacitors in parallel and discharges them in series to create high voltages.

### Pulse Parameters
- **Pulse Width**
- **Pulse Rise Time**
- **Pulse Rate**
- **Harmonics**
- **Frequency**

## Effects on Digital Devices
### Dumb Digital Devices
- **Characteristics**: Simple digital devices that continue to function after being exposed to an EMP.
- **Examples**: Standalone sensors (temperature, pressure, voltage).
- **Effect**: A type of EMP fuzzing, where the devices may experience temporary malfunctions but generally do not require manual reset.

### Smart Devices
- **Characteristics**: These devices typically reboot or turn off after being pulsed.
- **Effect**: They often need an operator to manually reset them before they can resume normal operation.

### Network Control
- **Impact**: Continuous pulsing can prevent a network from coming back online.
- **Affected Systems**: Linux, Unix, Sun, Windows, routers, and firewalls.

## Moore's Law and EMP
- **Moore's Law**: Every 18 months, the number of transistors that can be placed on a silicon wafer doubles.
- **Implications**: Die size decreases, and voltage requirements decrease, making modern devices more susceptible to EMPs.

## Byzantine Faults
- **Definition**: Faults in large, real-time distributed systems.
- **Tolerance and Recovery**: Byzantine fault tolerance and recovery strategies are essential.
- **Mathematical Condition**: For a solution to be possible, \( N > 3T + 1 \), where \( N \) is the number of processes and \( T \) is the number of corrupted processes.

## Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
- **Systems**: Large, real-time distributed systems used in control, chemical, water, oil, and power systems.
- **Device Mix**: Combination of smart and dumb devices.
- **Vulnerability**: Fuzzing of dumb devices can cause temporary disruptions.

## Green Revolution and Transportation
### Green Buses and Cars
- **Solid State Engine Controls**: Modern green buses and cars use solid-state engine controls, which can be vulnerable to EMPs.

### Robotic Trains
- **Examples**: L Train in NYC, DC Metro Train.
- **Third Rail Shoe Arc**: Potential source of EMP-like disturbances.

### Fly-by-Wire Systems
- **Boeing**: The pilot is in control.
- **Airbus**: The computer is in control.

## Notable Incidents
### TWA Flight 800
- **Incident**: An artifact pulse was recorded on the black box.
- **Energy**: Approximately 75 million joules.
- **Location**: Center fuel tank.
- **Black Box Analysis**: The black box would show an artifact or damped ringing if the plane was pulsed.

### Air France 447
- **Aircraft**: Airbus 330-200.

## Hospitals
- **Microprocessor-Rich Environment**: Hospitals contain a mix of dumb and smart devices.
- **Dumb Devices**: Continue to function without reset.
- **Smart Devices**: Require manual reset after being pulsed.
- **Critical Systems**: Patient monitoring, ventilators.

## Power Grid
### Overview
- **Subgrids**: Three major subgrids (East, West, Texas).
- **HVAC and HVDC**: High-voltage AC and DC grids.

### Power Quality
- **Factors**: Inductance, capacitance, harmonics, and transients.

## EMP Device Design
### The Gadget
- **Components**: 20-30 devices.
- **Cost**: $25,000-$35,000.
- **Design**: 60% based on the Tesla coil.
- **Technology**: Solid-state (MOSFET, IGBT) and tube (833A).

### Grid Stressors
- **Threats**: New network worms, viruses, software change cycles, hot weather, and EMP injection.
- **Strategy**: Distribute 20-30 devices over weak nodes, each tuned to specific parameters.
- **Outcome**: Potential to bring down the North American power grid.

## Conclusion
EMP injection into digital devices can have significant and varied impacts, ranging from temporary disruptions to complete system failures. Understanding the history, mechanisms, and effects of EMPs is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.
