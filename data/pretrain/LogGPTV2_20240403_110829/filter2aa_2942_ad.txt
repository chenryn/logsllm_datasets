and iterative steps: 
• Frame risk. Establish the context for risk-based decisions and the current state of the 
enterprise’s information and communications technology and services and the associated 
supply chain. 
• Assess risk. Review and interpret criticality, threat, vulnerability, likelihood,15 impact, 
and related information. 
• Respond to risk. Select, tailor, and implement mitigation controls based on risk 
assessment findings. 
• Monitor risk. Monitor risk exposure and the effectiveness of mitigating risk on an 
ongoing basis, including tracking changes to an information system or supply chain using 
effective enterprise communications and a feedback loop for continuous improvement. 
Fig. 2-1: Risk Management Process 
Managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain is a complex undertaking that requires 
cultural transformation and a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach across an enterprise. 
Effective cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) requires engagement from 
stakeholders inside the enterprise (e.g., departments, processes) and outside of the enterprise 
(e.g., suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers) to actively collaborate, communicate, and take actions to 
secure favorable C-SCRM outcomes. Successful C-SCRM requires an enterprise-wide cultural

Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
15 For C-SCRM purposes, likelihood is defined as the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability within a given timeframe. It should be 
noted that in mathematics, likelihood and probability are fundamentally different concepts, but the difference between the two is outside of the 
scope of this publication.

shift to a state of heightened awareness and preparedness as to the potential ramifications of 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.  
Enterprises should aim to infuse perspectives from multiple disciplines and processes (e.g., 
information security, procurement, enterprise risk management, engineering, software 
development, IT, legal, HR, etc.) into their approaches to managing cybersecurity risks 
throughout the supply chain. Enterprises may define explicit roles to bridge and integrate these 
processes as a part of an enterprise’s broader risk management activities. This orchestrated 
approach is an integral part of an enterprise’s effort to identify C-SCRM priorities, develop 
solutions, and incorporate C-SCRM into overall risk management decisions. Enterprises should 
perform C-SCRM activities as a part of the acquisition, SDLC, and broader enterprise risk 
management processes. Embedded C-SCRM activities involve determining the criticality of 
functions and their dependency on the supplied products and services, identifying and assessing 
applicable risks, determining appropriate mitigating actions, documenting selected risk response 
actions, and monitoring performance of C-SCRM activities. As exposure to supply chain risk 
differs across (and sometimes within) enterprises, business and mission-specific strategies, and 
policies should set the tone and direction for C-SCRM across the enterprise.  
2.1. 
The Business Case for C-SCRM 
Today, every enterprise heavily relies on digital technology to fulfill its business and mission. 
Digital technology is comprised of ICT/OT products and is delivered through and supported by 
services. C-SCRM is a critical capability that every enterprise needs to have to address 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain that arise from the use of digital technology. The 
depth, extent, and maturity of a C-SCRM capability for each enterprise should be based on the 
uniqueness of its business or mission, enterprise-specific compliance requirements, operational 
environment, risk appetite, and risk tolerance.  
Establishing and sustaining a C-SCRM capability creates a number of significant benefits: 
• An established C-SCRM program will enable enterprises to understand which critical 
assets are most susceptible to supply chain weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 
• C-SCRM reduces the likelihood of supply chain compromise by a cybersecurity threat 
by enhancing an enterprise’s ability to effectively detect, respond, and recover from 
events that result in significant business disruptions should a C-SCRM compromise 
occur.  
Organizations should ensure that tailored C-SCRM plans are designed to:  
• Manage rather than eliminate risk as risk is integral to the pursuit of value; 
• Ensure that operations are able to adapt to constantly emerging or evolving threats; 
• Be responsive to changes within their own organization, programs, and the supporting 
information systems; and  
• Adjust to the rapidly evolving practices of the private sector’s global ICT supply 
chain.

• Operational and enterprise efficiencies are achieved through clear structure, purpose, and 
alignment with C-SCRM capabilities and the prioritization, consolidation, and 
streamlining of existing C-SCRM processes.  
• There is greater assurance that acquired products are of high quality, authentic, reliable, 
resilient, maintainable, secure, and safe.  
• There is greater assurance that suppliers, service providers, and the technology products 
and services that they provide are trustworthy and can be relied upon to meet performance 
requirements. 
C-SCRM is fundamental to any effort to manage risk exposure arising from enterprise 
operations. Implementing C-SCRM processes and controls requires human, tooling, and 
infrastructure investments by acquirers and their developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. However, enterprises have finite 
resources to commit to establishing and deploying C-SCRM processes and controls. As such, 
enterprises should carefully weigh the potential costs and benefits when making C-SCRM 
resource commitment decisions and make decisions based on a clear understanding of any risk 
exposure implications that could arise from a failure to commit the necessary resources to C-
SCRM. 
While there are cost-benefit trade-offs that must be acknowledged, the need to better secure 
supply chains is an imperative for both government and the private sector. The passage of the 
2018 SECURE Technology Act,16 the formation of the FASC, and the observations from the 
2015 and 2019 Case Studies in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management captured in NIST 
Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk 
Management, point to a broad public and private sector consensus: C-SCRM capabilities are a 
critical and foundational component of any enterprise’s risk posture.  
2.2. 
Cybersecurity Risks Throughout Supply Chains 
Cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain refers to the potential for harm or compromise 
that arises from the cybersecurity risks posed by suppliers, their supply chains, and their products 
or services. Examples of these risks include:  
• Insiders working on behalf of a system integrator steal sensitive intellectual property, 
resulting in the loss of a major competitive advantage.17 
• A proxy working on behalf of a nation-state inserts malicious software into supplier-
provided product components used in systems sold to government agencies. A breach 
occurs and results in the loss of several government contracts.   
• A system integrator working on behalf of an agency reuses vulnerable code, leading to a 
breach of mission-critical data with national security implications.  
• An organized criminal enterprise introduces counterfeit products onto the market, 
resulting in a loss of customer trust and confidence. 
• A company is on contract to produce a critical component of a larger acquisition, but the 
company relabels products from an unvetted supplier. A critical component that cannot

be trusted is deployed into operational systems, and there no trusted supplier of 
replacement parts. 
Risks such as these are realized when threats in the cybersecurity supply chain exploit existing 
vulnerabilities. Figure 2-2 depicts supply chain cybersecurity risks resulting from the likelihood 
that relevant threats may exploit applicable vulnerabilities and the consequential potential 
impacts.  
Fig. 2-2: Cybersecurity Risks Throughout the Supply Chain 
Supply chain cybersecurity vulnerabilities may lead to persistent negative impacts on an 
enterprise’s missions, ranging from a reduction in service levels leading to customer 
dissatisfaction to the theft of intellectual property or the degradation of critical mission and 
business processes. It may, however, take years for such vulnerabilities to be exploited or 
discovered. It may also be difficult to determine whether an event was the direct result of a 
supply chain vulnerability. Vulnerabilities in the supply chain are often interconnected and may 
expose enterprises to cascading cybersecurity risks. For example, a large-scale service outage at 
a major cloud services provider may cause service or production disruptions for multiple entities 
within an enterprise’s supply chain and lead to negative effects within multiple mission and 
business processes.

2.3. 
Multilevel Risk Management18 
To integrate risk management throughout an enterprise, [NIST SP 800-39] describes three levels, 
depicted in Figure 2-3, that address risk from different perspectives: 1) the enterprise-level, 2) 
the mission and business process level, and 3) the operational level. C-SCRM requires the 
involvement of all three levels. 
Fig. 2-3: Multilevel Enterprise-Wide Risk Management19 
In multilevel risk management, the C-SCRM process is seamlessly carried out across the three 
tiers with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the enterprise’s risk-related 
activities and effective inter- and intra-level communication among stakeholders with a vested 
interest in C-SCRM.  
C-SCRM activities can be performed by a variety of individuals or groups within an enterprise, 
ranging from a single individual to committees, divisions, centralized program offices, or any 
other enterprise structure. C-SCRM activities are distinct for different enterprises depending on 
their structure, culture, mission, and many other factors. C-SCRM activities at each of the three 
levels include the production of different high-level C-SCRM deliverables. 
• At Level 1 (Enterprise), the overall C-SCRM strategy, policy, and implementation plan 
set the tone, governance structure, and boundaries for how C-SCRM is managed across 
the enterprise and guide C-SCRM activities performed at the mission and business 
process levels. 
18 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
19 Additional information about the concepts depicted in Figure 2-2 can be found in [NIST SP 800-39].

• At Level 2 (Mission and Business Process), the mid-level C-SCRM strategies, policies, 
and implementation plans assume the context and direction set forth at the enterprise 
level and tailor it to the specific mission and business process.  
• At Level 3 (Operational), the C-SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether 
an information system meets business, functional, and technical requirements and 
includes appropriately tailored controls. These plans are heavily influenced by the context 
and direction provided by Level 2.  
Figure 2-4 provides an overview of the multilevel risk management structure and the associated 
strategies, policies, and plans developed at each level. Refer to Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.5 for a 
more in-depth discussion of the specific activities at each level.  
Fig. 2-4: C-SCRM Documents in Multilevel Enterprise-wide Risk Management 
2.3.1. Roles and Responsibilities Across the Three Levels 
Implementing C-SCRM requires enterprises to establish a coordinated team-based approach and 
a shared responsibility model to effectively manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain. Enterprises should establish and adhere to C-SCRM-related policies, develop and follow 
processes (often cross-enterprise in nature), and employ programmatic and technical mitigation 
techniques. The coordinated team approach, either ad hoc or formal, enables enterprises to 
effectively conduct a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of their supply chain and to 
respond to risks, communicate with external partners/stakeholders, and gain broad consensus 
regarding appropriate resources for C-SCRM. The C-SCRM team should work together to make 
decisions and take actions deriving from the input and involvement of multiple perspectives and 
expertise. The team leverages but does not replace those C-SCRM responsibilities and processes 
that should be specifically assigned to an individual enterprise or disciplinary area. Effective 
implementations of C-SCRM often include the adoption of a shared responsibility model, which

PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS

This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1 
distributes responsibilities and accountabilities for C-SCRM-related activities and risk across a 
diverse group of stakeholders. Examples of C-SCRM activities in which enterprises benefit from 
a multidisciplinary approach include developing a strategic sourcing strategy, incorporating C-
SCRM requirements into a solicitation, and determining options for how best to mitigate an 
identified supply chain risk, especially one assessed to be significant.  
Members of the C-SCRM team should be a diverse group of people involved in the various 
aspects of the enterprise’s critical processes, such as information security, procurement, 
enterprise risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, and HR. To aid in C-
SCRM, these individuals should provide expertise in enterprise processes and practices specific 
to their discipline area and an understanding of the technical aspects and inter-dependencies of 
systems or information flowing through systems. The C-SCRM team may be an extension of an 
enterprise’s existing enterprise risk management function, grown as part of an enterprise’s 
cybersecurity risk management function, or operate out of a different department.  
The key to forming multidisciplinary C-SCRM teams is breaking down barriers between 
otherwise disparate functions within the enterprise. Many enterprises begin this process from the 
top by establishing a working group or council of senior leaders with representation from the 
necessary and appropriate functional areas. A charter should be established outlining the goals, 
objectives, authorities, meeting cadences, and responsibilities of the working group. Once this 
council is formed, decisions can be made on how to operationalize the interdisciplinary approach 
at mission and business process and operational levels. This often takes the form of working 
groups that consist of mission and business process representatives who can meet at more regular 
cadences and address more operational and tactically focused C-SCRM challenges.  
Table 2-1 shows a summary of C-SCRM stakeholders for each level with the specific C-SCRM 
activities performed within the corresponding level. These activities are either direct C-SCRM 
activities or have an impact on C-SCRM.
