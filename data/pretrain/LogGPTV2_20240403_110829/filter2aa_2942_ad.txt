### Iterative Steps in the Risk Management Process

1. **Frame Risk:**
   - Establish the context for risk-based decisions, including the current state of the enterpriseâ€™s information and communications technology (ICT) and associated supply chain.
   
2. **Assess Risk:**
   - Review and interpret criticality, threat, vulnerability, likelihood, impact, and related information. For C-SCRM purposes, likelihood is defined as the probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability within a given timeframe. Note that in mathematics, likelihood and probability are fundamentally different concepts, but this distinction is outside the scope of this publication.

3. **Respond to Risk:**
   - Select, tailor, and implement mitigation controls based on the findings from the risk assessment.

4. **Monitor Risk:**
   - Continuously monitor risk exposure and the effectiveness of implemented mitigations. This includes tracking changes to the information system or supply chain using effective enterprise communications and a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

### Managing Cybersecurity Risks in the Supply Chain

Managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain is a complex task that requires cultural transformation and a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach across the enterprise. Effective Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) involves engagement from both internal (e.g., departments, processes) and external stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, developers, system integrators, and other ICT/OT-related service providers) to collaborate, communicate, and take actions to secure favorable C-SCRM outcomes.

**Key Points:**
- **Cultural Shift:** Enterprises must shift to a state of heightened awareness and preparedness regarding the potential ramifications of cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.
- **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Infuse perspectives from multiple disciplines and processes (e.g., information security, procurement, enterprise risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, HR) into the C-SCRM approach.
- **Role Definition:** Define explicit roles to bridge and integrate these processes as part of broader risk management activities.
- **Integration with Other Processes:** Perform C-SCRM activities as part of the acquisition, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and broader enterprise risk management processes.
- **Customization:** Business and mission-specific strategies and policies should set the tone and direction for C-SCRM across the enterprise.

### The Business Case for C-SCRM

Every enterprise relies heavily on digital technology, which is composed of ICT/OT products and services. C-SCRM is essential to address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The depth, extent, and maturity of a C-SCRM capability should be tailored to the uniqueness of the business or mission, compliance requirements, operational environment, risk appetite, and risk tolerance.

**Benefits of C-SCRM:**
- **Understanding Vulnerabilities:** Identify which critical assets are most susceptible to supply chain weaknesses.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduce the likelihood of supply chain compromise by enhancing the ability to detect, respond, and recover from significant business disruptions.
- **Adaptability:** Ensure operations can adapt to emerging or evolving threats and changes within the organization and its supporting information systems.
- **Efficiency:** Achieve operational and enterprise efficiencies through clear structure, purpose, and alignment with C-SCRM capabilities.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure acquired products are high quality, authentic, reliable, resilient, maintainable, secure, and safe.
- **Trustworthiness:** Ensure suppliers, service providers, and their products and services are trustworthy and meet performance requirements.

### Cybersecurity Risks Throughout the Supply Chain

Cybersecurity risks in the supply chain refer to the potential for harm or compromise arising from the cybersecurity risks posed by suppliers, their supply chains, and their products or services. Examples include:

- **Insider Threats:** Insiders working on behalf of a system integrator steal sensitive intellectual property.
- **Nation-State Threats:** A proxy inserts malicious software into supplier-provided product components used in government systems.
- **Vulnerable Code:** A system integrator reuses vulnerable code, leading to a breach of mission-critical data.
- **Counterfeit Products:** An organized criminal enterprise introduces counterfeit products, resulting in a loss of customer trust.
- **Unvetted Suppliers:** A company relabels products from an unvetted supplier, leading to the deployment of untrusted critical components.

### Multilevel Risk Management

To integrate risk management throughout an enterprise, NIST SP 800-39 describes three levels: 
1. **Enterprise Level:** Set the overall C-SCRM strategy, policy, and implementation plan.
2. **Mission and Business Process Level:** Tailor the C-SCRM strategy to specific missions and business processes.
3. **Operational Level:** Develop C-SCRM plans to ensure information systems meet business, functional, and technical requirements.

### Roles and Responsibilities Across the Three Levels

Implementing C-SCRM requires a coordinated team-based approach and a shared responsibility model. Key points include:

- **Team-Based Approach:** Establish a diverse group of stakeholders from various disciplines (e.g., information security, procurement, enterprise risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, HR).
- **Shared Responsibility Model:** Distribute responsibilities and accountabilities for C-SCRM-related activities and risks across a diverse group of stakeholders.
- **Top-Down Support:** Begin with a working group or council of senior leaders to set the goals, objectives, and meeting cadences.

**Table 2-1: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Stakeholders**

| **Level** | **Name** | **Stakeholder** | **Activities** |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1         | Enterprise | Executive Leadership (CEO, CIO, COO, CFO, CISO, CTO, CAO, CPO, CRO, etc.) | Define C-SCRM strategy, form governance structures, frame risk, set risk appetite, define high-level implementation plan, make enterprise-level C-SCRM decisions, form a C-SCRM PMO. |
| 2         | Mission and Business Process | Business Management (PM, project managers, IPT members, R&D, engineering, acquisition and supplier relationship management, C-SCRM PMO, etc.) | Develop mission-specific strategy, policies, and procedures, reduce vulnerabilities, assess system flaws, develop C-SCRM implementation plans, manage risk, report on C-SCRM. |
| 3         | Operational | Systems Management (architects, developers, system owners, QA/QC, testing, contracting personnel, C-SCRM PMO staff, control engineers, etc.) | Implement and monitor C-SCRM controls, ensure compliance, and report on operational C-SCRM activities. |

**Note:** Small and mid-sized businesses may not see such a high degree of differentiation in their C-SCRM stakeholders.

This structured and comprehensive approach ensures that C-SCRM is effectively integrated into the enterprise's overall risk management framework, leading to better security and resilience in the supply chain.
