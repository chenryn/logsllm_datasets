User: I cannot run any script by pressing F5 or selecting run from the menus in IDLE. It stopped working suddenly. No errors are coughed up. IDLE simply does nothing at all.
Tried reinstalling python to no effect.
Cannot run even the simplest script.
Thank you for any help or suggestions you have.
Running Python 2.6.5 on windows 7.
Could not resolve the problem with idle. I have switched to using pyDev in Aptana Studio 3.
Assistant: Your function keys are locked,I think so.
Function keys can be unlocked by  fn key + esc.
Then f5 will work without any issue.
