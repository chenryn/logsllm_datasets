User: I have a file abc.py under the workspace dir. 
I am using os.listdir('/home/workspace/tests') in abc.py to list all the files (test1.py, test2.py...)
I want to generate the path  '/home/workspace/tests' or even '/home/workspace' instead of hardcoding it. 
I tried os.getcwd() and os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(____file____)) but this instead generates the path where the test script is being run.
How to go about it?
Assistant: I think you are asking about how to get the relative path instead of absolute one.
Absolute path is the one like: "/home/workspace" 
Relative looks like the following "./../workspace" 
You should construct the relative path from the dir where your script is (/home/workspace/tests) to the dir that you want to acces (/home/workspace) that means, in this case, to go one step up in the directory tree. 
You can get this by executing:
os.path.dirname(os.path.join("..", os.path.abspath(__file__)))
The same result may be achieved if you go two steps up and one step down to workspace dir:
os.path.dirname(os.path.join("..", "..", "workspace", os.path.abspath(__file__)))
In this manner you actually can access any directory without knowing it's absolute path, but only knowing where it resides relatively to your executed file.
