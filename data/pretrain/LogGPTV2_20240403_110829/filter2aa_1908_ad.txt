and manage their own identification namespace, as well as reconcile incompatible standards and 
practices. 
Since SBOM is an emerging technology, suppliers are still learning how to share this data with 
their customers. Fortunately, many suppliers already have trusted channels with their 
downstream users, including for software updates and support, although not all of these are 
automated or flexible. Several promising technologies have emerged or are being developed that 
might be well-suited to enable the discovery, access, and automated ingestion of SBOM data. 
Several technologies are worth noting here. The Manufacturer Usage Descriptor is a mechanism 
to allow a device to communicate important information about itself on the network, including 
network functionality20 and, notably for this document, SBOMs.21 The “Digital Bill of 
Materials” is a solution that supports multiple attestations about an open-ended set of supply 
chain data, including SBOM, and the enforcement of sharing and the access policies around 
these attestations.22 OpenC2 is a standardized language for the command and control of 
technologies that provide or support cyber defense; work has begun to use it to handle, process, 
and act on SBOM data.23  
SBOMs can also be handled by some set of trusted third-parties, which raises many of the usual 
strengths and weaknesses of relying on centralization. Challenges include trust and funding 
sources. One added benefit of some centralization that has been suggested is that “SBOMs gain 
greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other 
applications and systems.”24 This can be used to gain more insights into systematic risk facing 
organizations, or even ecosystems or the country itself. It can facilitate coordinated vulnerability

disclosure by giving coordinators an idea of which organizations or suppliers are at risk. Pooled 
data could help a centralized actor understand, which components are used the most widely, or in 
the most critical sectors, and prioritize security research or hardening practices. However, some 
have raised concerns that adversaries could take advantage and target those critical components 
for novel attacks. Further research is necessary to understand the optimal structure and incentives 
for sharing, protecting, and using SBOM data.  
Ultimately, SBOM should not be seen as a unique security phenomenon, but yet another practice 
that can support the broader effort to secure the supply chain. In addition to linking this data to 
more supply chain data in the software domain, this data can be tied to hardware data. Hardware 
offers the features of a hardware root-of-trust and greater end-to-end assurance. At the same 
time, risks to the hardware supply chain pose their own challenges, and hardware-specific 
metadata should be considered and integrated into overall supply chain risk management along 
with SBOM data. 
Lastly, as SBOM technology, tools, and practices mature, standards organizations should 
consider integrating them into voluntary, consensus-based standards. As noted in this discussion 
of minimum elements, SBOM covers both specific data and organizational practices. These have 
been developed in an iterative fashion to prove what works and affords rapid innovation. Given 
the cross-organizational nature of SBOM, it is important to demonstrate both feasibility and 
scalability before they are locked into formal standards. However, as evidence accrues of 
successful widespread implementation, sectors and standards experts should codify the 
technology and practices into international standards.  
VII. Conclusion  
This report is the product of carefully considered input from stakeholders across the government, 
private sector, and academia. The minimum elements of an SBOM are a starting point, based on 
what is conceivable today. The process of determining what constitutes the minimum elements 
of an SBOM should not end here. As the additional elements identified above in Beyond 
Minimum Elements and The Future of SBOM also become feasible, tested, and built into tools, 
those should be added to the minimum elements.  
These minimum elements will be a key input into the Federal Government’s work to improve the 
security and integrity of the software supply chain, particularly for critical software. Executive 
Order 14028 defines these next steps, notably calling for specific guidance, including “standards, 
procedures, or criteria.”25 To support and complement this work, the Federal Government should 
encourage or develop resources on how to implement SBOMs, potentially involving sector-
specific or technology-specific details. It will be important to build on, and potentially expand,

the public-private partnerships that have already been established and which have focused on 
defining and operationalizing SBOM’s related supply chain work. 
Finally, defining the minimum elements of an SBOM is an iterative process. Some elements are 
omitted from this listing simply because they are not yet feasible for the majority of stakeholders. 
However, in the near future, they likely will become feasible. This report should be seen as a 
starting point, rather than the last word.

Appendix A: Methodology  
The Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity directed the Department of 
Commerce, in coordination with the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (NTIA), to publish the minimum elements for a Software Bill of Materials 
(SBOM). Upon receiving the tasking in EO 14028, the Department, through NTIA, began 
working to develop a preliminary approach to the minimum elements, basing the initial draft on 
the work drafted by stakeholders in NTIA’s open, public multistakeholder process on software 
component transparency.  
On June 2, 2021, NTIA published a Notice and Request for Comments (RFC) on the minimum 
elements for an SBOM, and what other factors should be considered in the request, production, 
distribution, and consumption of SBOMs. The Notice and RFC included the preliminary 
minimum elements for comment.26 Comments were due on or before June 17, 2021. NTIA 
received approximately 88 comments, from stakeholders across the public and private sector, in 
response to this request.  
In addition, NTIA performed interviews with a total of 32 Federal government officials 
representing both mission-driven and operational approaches to cybersecurity, from civilian, 
intelligence, and national security communities. NTIA analyzed the input received in the 
comments and the interviews and synthesized the material for this report on minimum elements.  
The NTIA multistakeholder process on software component transparency was a separate process 
it convened in 2018. The first open, public meeting in July of 2018 allowed the participants in 
Washington and participating online to debate the overall issue of software component 
transparency. From this initial meeting, a series of working groups were established to tackle 
transparency from several different perspectives. One group tackled the overall challenge of 
what a “software bill of materials” should look like, the second documented existing and 
potential use cases for transparency, while the third reviewed the existing standards and formats 
that could be used to convey SBOM data. A final working group proposed and executed a “proof 
of concept” exercise with medical device manufacturers and the hospitals that used these 
devices. Working groups met weekly or biweekly to define their charter and workstreams. All 
working groups were open, and new stakeholders joined as the project progressed. Each group 
was led by 2-3 co-chairs who volunteered from the community. The broader community 
reconvened every 3-4 months to share progress from the different working groups and discuss 
the overall direction of this initiative.  
For the multistakeholder process, NTIA acted as a convener and a neutral facilitator, and helped 
the different working groups coordinate as their work progressed. Those work products were 
drafted by stakeholders with frequent opportunities for the community to weigh in as the

activity to propose the minimum elements of an SBOM, called for in EO 14028.

Appendix B: Glossary 
Authenticity 
The property that data originated from its purported source.27 
Author  
An entity that creates an SBOM. When author and supplier are different, this indicates that one 
entity (the author) is making claims about components created or included by a different entity 
(the supplier).28  
Component  
A unit of software defined by a supplier at the time the component is built, packaged, or 
delivered. Many components contain subcomponents. Examples of components include a 
software product, a device, a library, or a single file. 
Consumer 
Entity that obtains SBOMs. An entity can be both a supplier and consumer, using components 
with SBOM data in its own software, which is then passed downstream. An “end-user” consumer 
(that is not also a supplier) may also be called an operator or a leaf entity.29 
Dependency 
Characterizing the relationship that an upstream component X is included in software Y. 
Downstream 
Referring to how a component is subsequently used in other pieces of software at a later stage in 
the supply chain. 
Integrity 
Guarding against improper information modification or destruction.30 
Lifecycle Phase 
The stage in the software lifecycle where an SBOM is generated (e.g. from source, at the time of 
build or packaging, or from a built executable).

Open-source software  
Software that can be accessed, used, modified, and shared by anyone.31 
Pedigree  
Data on the origins of components that have come together to make a piece of software and the 
process under which they came together. This could include data beyond the minimum elements, 
such as compiler details and settings.32 
Provenance  
Data about the chain of custody of the software and all of the constituent components, potentially 
including data about the authors and locations from where the components were obtained.33 
SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)  
A formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components 
used in building software. Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling 
existing open source and commercial software components. The SBOM enumerates these 
components in a product.34 
Software-as-a-Service 
The capability provided to the consumer to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud 
infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin 
client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The 
consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, 
servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible 
exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.35 
Subcomponent 
Constituent part(s) of a component. 
Supplier  
An entity that creates, defines, and identifies components and produces associated SBOMs. A 
supplier may also be known as a manufacturer, vendor, developer, integrator, maintainer, or 
provider. Ideally, all suppliers are also authors of SBOMs for the suppliers’ components. Most 
suppliers are also consumers. A supplier with no included upstream components is a root 
entity.36

Transitive Dependency 
Characterizing the relationship that if an upstream component X is included in software Y and 
component Z is included in component X then component Z is included in software Y.
