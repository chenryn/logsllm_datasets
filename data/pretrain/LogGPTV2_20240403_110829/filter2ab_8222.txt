### Title: Blackhat Asia-23: Phoenix Domain Attack - Vulnerabilities in Domain Name Delegation and Revocation

**Abstract:**

The Phoenix Domain attack is a novel and general method that enables adversaries to keep revoked malicious domains continuously resolvable on a large scale. This attack reinvigorates the previously mitigated Ghost Domain attack. The Phoenix Domain attack has two variations and affects all mainstream DNS software and public DNS resolvers because it does not violate any DNS specifications or best security practices.

**Methodology:**

The attack was made possible through a systematic "reverse engineering" of the cache operations of eight DNS implementations, revealing new attack surfaces in the domain name delegation processes. We tested 41 well-known public DNS resolvers and found that all surveyed DNS services, including Google Public DNS and Cloudflare DNS, are vulnerable to the Phoenix Domain attack.

**Results:**

Extensive measurement studies were conducted using 210,000 stable and distributed DNS recursive resolvers. The results show that even one month after domain name revocation and cache expiration, more than 25% of recursive resolvers can still resolve the revoked domain. This provides adversaries with an opportunity to evade the security measures designed to take down malicious domains.

**Mitigation and Response:**

We have reported the discovered vulnerabilities to all affected vendors and suggested six types of mitigation approaches. Currently, seven DNS software providers and 15 resolver vendors, including BIND, Unbound, Google, and Cloudflare, have confirmed the vulnerabilities. Some of these vendors are implementing and publishing mitigation patches based on our recommendations. Additionally, nine CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) numbers have been assigned to these vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

This study highlights the need for standardization to address the issue of secure domain name revocation and maintaining cache consistency. The Phoenix Domain attack underscores the importance of robust and consistent security practices in the DNS ecosystem.
