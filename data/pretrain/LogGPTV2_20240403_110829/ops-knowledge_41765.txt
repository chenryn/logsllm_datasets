User: What is the best way to create a custom document editor in GAE? I'm making a website meant for a School Robotics Club (With support for any other organization - DRY).
We currently use Google services for online collaboration, I'm wondering if there is a way to tap into Google Docs and allow users to edit a Google Document without using Google Accounts or the Google Docs [EDIT]interface website[/EDIT].
If that is not possible (I've researched and I don't think it is), what is the best way to make a document editor? I want it completely on the website I'm creating, so I'm assuming just some javascript editor like TinyMCE + Ajax + Datastore. Is their anything that replicates Google Doc's/Microsoft Offices's/OpenOffice.org's feature set as far as fonts, spacing, alignment, justification, etc.?
Assistant: It sounds to me like you want to use the Google Docs editor like a widget within your application.  To the best of my knowledge you can't do this.
