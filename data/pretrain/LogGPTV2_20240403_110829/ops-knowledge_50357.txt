User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: I have similar problem when I reinstall my python, by uninstalling python3.7 and installing python3.8. But I solved it by removing the previous version of python directory. For me it was located here,

C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python

I deleted the folder named Python37 (for previous version) and keep Python38 (for updated version). This worked because python itself seems having a trouble on finding the right directory for your python scripts.
