Hello,

Thank you for your excellent work, which I frequently utilize!

I have encountered a challenge after conducting a Kruskal-Wallis H-test for independent samples. Specifically, I need to perform a Dunn test as a post-hoc analysis. However, I have not been able to find an existing implementation of the Dunn test in Python. The only implementation I have found is in R (refer to this link: [insert link here]).

Thank you for your attention and any assistance you can provide.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
