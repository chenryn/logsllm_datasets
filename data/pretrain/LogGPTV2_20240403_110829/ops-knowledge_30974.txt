User: Please provide a feasible Linux hard disk partitioning scheme to minimize the risk of data loss.
Assistant: The following is a feasible Linux hard disk partition scheme: 1. Install the operating system (such as Ubuntu) in a separate partition with a size of no less than 20GB. 2. Create a separate /home partition to hold user data and configuration files. This /home partition can be shared if you are using multiple Linux distributions on the same machine. 3. Create a separate /boot partition, which should be small enough to hold your boot loader (such as GRUB) and the Linux kernel image file. It is recommended to set the /boot partition size to 200MB. 4. Create a separate /swap partition for memory expansion (virtual memory). It is recommended to set the /swap partition size to twice the physical memory. 5. Merge all other partitions (such as /var, /tmp, /usr, etc.) into a separate partition. In this way, storing the operating system, user data, and configuration files separately minimizes the risk of data loss. If you need to reinstall the operating system, you can format only the root partition without losing user data and configuration files.
