tions. That results in an attacker’s accuracy of ≤ 56.3%,
which is only 6.3% better than pure guessing.
8 Ethical aspects
While our design takes care not to harm a involuntary
participant’s system,
it causes an involuntary partici-
pant’s browser to execute our JavaScript code, stores
14
content and forces participation in our protocol. In order
words, we propose to use the computation and trafﬁc re-
sources of a visitor to increase the anonymity of an ACN.
To inform the visitor about this involuntary allocation of
resources, the entry web page can include information
for the visitors or even require explicit consent from the
visitors.
We argue that the amount of resources that we allocate
is not out of scale. Our work received a formal approval
of our ETH’s ethics commission. First, the involuntary
allocation of resources is nothing unexpected for the vis-
itor; it is already done by advertisements or QoS scripts
such as Google Analytics. In particular, webpages that
incorporate CoverUp would not cause unexpected be-
havior on a visitor’s browser.
Second, we propose to
only incorporate our design into non-mobile version of
a webpage, thereby excluding mobile phone visitors and
visitors from structurally weak areas from any overhead.
Third, we discuss the overhead for a visitor in Section 4.2
in detail. As a summary, the computational overhead of
CoverUp is negligible but the trafﬁc overhead for a visi-
tor would be around 9MB per day. While this is a non-
negligible amount of trafﬁc, a single YouTube Video or
even visiting 4 Alexa Top 15 News Sites can cause more
trafﬁc. Moreover, we think that in the future trafﬁc will
become much cheaper while our system remains highly
useful even if solely text is transmitted, i.e., with 9MB
per day.
9 Discussion of selected legal questions
One of the challenges in answering the question whether
the provision of CoverUp and the upload of
the
JavaScript code by the entry server is legal or not (and
many other questions evolving around the use of the
Internet) is that, whereas the Internet functions glob-
ally, law mostly [43] remains limited by territory be-
cause sovereign states put their own legislation into ef-
fect [17, 18, 11]. The legal provisions and possible of-
fenses that apply to the technical setup of CoverUp, dif-
fer from country to country. Moreover, as law is not an
exact science and deﬁnite legal statements are made by
the courts, we conclude the legal discussion herein with
an assessment that we consider probable.
In this section we limit the legal analysis to a selected
discussion on whether the activity of the provider of the
entry server could qualify as cybercrime offense. We do
not, for instance, analyse offenses by the provider of the
CoverUp server or of the mix server, or cover aiding and
abetting.
Many countries enforce their own laws and have their
own (territorial) jurisdiction, many countries, among oth-
ers the EU member states and the USA, have ratiﬁed [2]
in the Convention on Cybercrime [43] (CCC) – the inter-
national treaty on crimes committed via the Internet and
other computer networks. This international treaty crim-
inalizes, among others, illegal access (article 2 CCC),
data interference (article 4 CCC), and misuse of devices
(article 6 CCC). Do these offenses apply to the provider
of the entry server?
Illegal access
9.1
Illegal access (article 2 CCC) penalizes the entering of a
computer system but does not include the mere sending
of an e-mail message or a ﬁle to a system. The appli-
cation of standard tools provided for in the commonly
applied communication protocols and programs, is not
per se “without right”, in particular not if the accessing
application can be considered to have been accepted (e.g.
acceptance of cookies [19, 14, 15, 16] by client).
However, a broad interpretation of article 2 CCC is not
undisputed (refer [43], para. 44 - 50).
Upon request, the entry server delivers a webpage that
contains an iframe request for the CoverUp server, which
then delivers the JavaScript to the browser for the down-
load of the droplets. Not only does the entry server
merely send a ﬁle (pointer) to the browser, but the request
to download the JavaScript from the CoverUp server is
standard browser functionality for communication. The
same would happen if the entry server were ﬁnanced by
online advertising: upon request the entry server would
deliver a webpage pointing to the advertising server and
trigger the download of the advertising text or pictures
to the browser. As this is a standard online process, we
conclude that even in a broad interpretation of article 2
CCC, the provider of the entry server should not be ille-
gally accessing the browser.
9.2 Data interference
Data interference (article 4 CCC) penalizes the damag-
ing, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of
computer data “without right”. This provision protects a
computer device from the input of malicious code, such
as viruses and Trojan horses as well as the resulting al-
teration of data. However, the modiﬁcation of trafﬁc data
for the purpose of facilitating anonymous communica-
tions (e.g., the activities of anonymous remailer systems)
should in principle be considered legitimate protection of
privacy (refer [4, 5, 8, 7], [12, Recitals(1) and (35)]), [13,
Article 13], and, therefore, be considered as being under-
taken “with right” [43, para. 61].
CoverUp does not damage, delete, deteriorate, or sup-
press data on the participant’s client. However, it does
alter the data on the hard disk: on the one hand the
webpage with the iframe uses disk space and thus mod-
iﬁes the participant’s data; on the other hand CoverUp
triggers the download of the JavaScript code and subse-
quently the droplets from the mix server to the involun-
tary participant’s browser, which again uses disk space
and thus modiﬁes the data anew.
However the explanatory report to the Convention on
Cybercrime foresees that the ﬁle causing data interfer-
ence be “malicious”. Code is malicious if it executes
harmful functions or if the functions are undesirable.
As we concluded in the previous subsection, the web-
page containing the iframe request for the CoverUp
server submitted by the entry server is standard core
browser functionality. Thus from a technical viewpoint,
CoverUp is not harmful. Therefore in our view the
provider of the entry server not does cause any malicious
data interference. We advocate that article 4 should not
apply to the provision of the webpage with the iframe by
the provider of the entry server.
9.3 Misuse of devices
Misuse of devices (article 6 CCC) penalizes the produc-
tion, making available, or distribution of a code designed
or adapted primarily for the purpose of committing a cy-
bercrime offense, or the possession of such a computer
program. It refers to the commission of “hacker tools”,
i.e. programs that are e.g. designed to alter or even de-
stroy data or interfere with the operation of systems, such
as virus programs, or programs designed or adapted to
gain access to computer systems. The objective element
of offense comprises several activities, e.g. distribution
of such code (i.e.
the active act of forwarding data to
others), or making code available (i.e. placing online de-
vices or hyperlinks to such devices for the use by others)
[2, para. 72].
One of the main questions relating to the misuse of de-
vices is how to handle dual use devices (code). Dual use
means in our case that the JavaScript code could be used
to download legal content, e.g. political information, as
well as illegal content, e.g. child pornography. Should
article 6 CCC only criminalize the distribution or making
available of code that is exclusively written to commit of-
fenses or should it include all code, even if produced and
distributed legally? Article 6 CCC restricts the scope to
cases where the code is objectively designed primarily
for the purpose of committing an offense, thereby usu-
ally excluding dual-use devices [2, para. 72 - 73].
First, it is important to note that CoverUp was not de-
signed primarily for the purpose of committing an of-
fense. While the main purpose of CoverUp is to protect
privacy, it can be used to conceal illegal activities.
Second, can the download of criminal information be
considered an illegal activity if the information is en-
crypted? Here we draw a legal analogy to data protection
law. Data relating to an identiﬁed or identiﬁable person
15
is considered personal data [12, article 2(a)], [23, article
4(1)]. If a person is identiﬁable or identiﬁed, data protec-
tion law applies. However, if the personal data are pseu-
domised or anonymised, then data protection law might
not apply anymore because the (formerly identiable or
identiﬁed) person cannot longer be identiﬁed.
Recital (83), article 6(4)(e), 32(1)(a) and 34(3)(a) of
the new General Data Protection Regulation6 stipulate
that encryption renders the personal data unintelligible
and mitigates the risk of infringing the new regulation.
By applying this data protection principle to the en-
cryption of data by CoverUp we can argue that the data
provided by the mix server in the droplets are not infor-
mation because the data is unintelligible. Not only does
the involuntary participant not have sufﬁcient data to re-
assemble the droplets to a whole, but the data are en-
crypted in such manner that it is impossible to make any
sense of it. At least from a theoretical viewpoint the en-
cryption of CoverUp cannot be breached. We therefore
conclude that the JavaScript code (a) with regard to the
involuntary participant does not qualify as dual use de-
vice because even if it is used for illegal purpose, the
data transmitted remain unintelligible and therefore do
not qualify as information; and (b) with regard to the vol-
untary participant can be qualiﬁed as dual use device be-
cause the encrypted and unintelligible data are decrypted
and reassembled to intelligible information.
9.4 Legal conclusion
We discussed the applicability of articles 2 (illegal ac-
cess), 4 (data interference), and 6 (misuse of device)
CCC to CoverUp. We conclude that the provider of the
entry server is probably not illegally accessing the partic-
ipant’s browser by applying CoverUp; that the provider
of the entry server probably does not cause any mali-
cious data interference; and that the use of CoverUp
with regard to the involuntary participant does not qual-
ify as misuse of device. As regards the reassembly of the
droplets to a meaningful whole, if the information is il-
legal, CoverUp might qualify as dual use device and fall
under article 6 CCC. We conclude that at least with re-
gard to the risk of indictment pursuant to article 6 CCC it
seems advisable that the provider of the entry server does
not provide the JavaScript code for download.
10 Deployment
We have witnessed a steady rise of concern regarding pri-
vacy. Such includes state backed surveillance, web based
services collecting huge amount of private information
6Regulation (EU), applicable as of 25.5.2018
and discrimination of citizens who access sensitive ma-
terials such as leaked documents. In recent years, a num-
ber of countries reformed their privacy protection laws,
which speciﬁcally aims to provide protections against the
misuse of citizens’ private data. One major example is
European Union’s EU-GDPR and the surveys accompa-
nying it [21, 22] shows that there is a need for privacy-
preserving systems. Anonymous communication net-
works (ACN) is the basic building blocks for many pri-
vacy preserving protocols. CoverUp provides a strong
privacy guarantee for hiding the intention. Our proposed
forced participation technique achieves this by hiding the
voluntary users in the trafﬁc generated by the involuntary
users. Existing systems can easily incorporate CoverUp
by setting up the entry server in their own service. The
code integrating is effortless and requires almost no mod-
iﬁcation. The host servers only have to include an iframe
pointing to the CoverUp server.
The external application and the browser extension
have to be delivered out-of-band channel.
Installing
these two components is straight-forward as it only in-
cludes to add the extension program to Chrome and run
the external application’s compiled binary.

Hiding ones intentions in the internet is done since the
beginning. It is closely connected the ﬁeld of censorship
circumvention.
Anonymous communication protocols. There are nu-
merous approaches to hide a user’s trafﬁc. Anonymous
communication (AC) protocols hide trafﬁc by rerouting
and potentially waiting. Low-latency AC protocols, such
as Tor [35] or Hornet [31], are vulnerable to trafﬁc corre-
lation attacks. High-latency mix-nets, such as Mixmin-
ion [34], which do not require the user client to continu-
ously send messages leak a user’s intend to connect to the
anonymity network, which might seem suspicious and
prevent a user from using the mix-net client. AC proto-
cols that do require the user client to continuously send
messages, such as DISSENT [32] or Vuzuvela [57], still
require the active participation of the users in the proto-
col, which can leak the intention. Our solution can be
easier deployed and does not require a sophisticated in-
frastructure.
Ricochet is a related project: an anonymous chat.
Based on Tor’s hidden service design, Ricochet imple-
ments a privacy-preserving instant messenger. As Rico-
chet is based Tor, it suffers from Tor’s weaknesses, such
as trafﬁc correlation attacks and website ﬁngerprinting.
As our system is a constant-rate communication system,
CoverUp does not suffer from these kinds of attacks. Tor

bootstrapp mid- and high-latency ACNs.
Covert channels & steganography. Covert channels
hide whether communication took place, and thus
achieve full deniability. As covert channels typically
use a piggyback approach to transport data, they de-
pend on existing data streams, resulting in a dependency
of the piggybacked system for latency and throughput.
Steganography is another approach which is hiding mes-
sages in unsuspicious looking data [47, 37, 24]. But
once detected, the origin and therefore the intention is
obvious. The same applies to Mixing [48]. Plausible
deniability is the possibility to deny the knowledge of
actions done by others (e.g., Cirripede [44]). Off-the-
record messaging: published MAC key after talk: does
not protect against real time monitoring [26].
McPherson et al. proposed CovertCast, a broadcast
hidden in normal video streams like YouTube [50]. Che
et al. were able to create a deniable communication
channel based on different levels of noisy channels [30].
Deploying that system is, however, require a much
higher effort by the service provider (e.g., YouTube)
and does not provide any interactive communication like
CoverUp. Freewave [45] provides a covet channel where
the user can modulate his internet trafﬁc signal into
acoustic data and transfer it to remote server via VoIP
such as skype. Such system have bandwidth limitation
and is vulnerable to attacks described in [39]. SWEET
[60] describes a covert channel e-mail communication
where the user can send the query to the remote server
by using any available mail server. Such system suf-
fered from very low bandwidth and high latency, mak-
ing them practically infeasible for deployment. Cloud-
Transport [28] introduced covert communication which
involves publicly accessible cloud servers such as Ama-
zon S3 which acts as the oblivious mix. But services like
this does not provide protection against attackers learn-
ing intention. Infranet [38] describes a system executing
covert communication using image stenography but also
suffers from a low bandwidth.
Peer-to-peer variant. Even though the CoverUp per-
forms reasonably well in terms of bandwidth (for serving
normal HTML pages, refer Section 4.2.1), the latency is
