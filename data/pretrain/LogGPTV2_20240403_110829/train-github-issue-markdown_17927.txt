I get very very strange numerical inconsistencies like these:

I could reproduce this in ipython and jupyter notebook but only on macOS, not
on Linux. Here is a gist with code to reproduce the error (Note that you need
to download and unzip a file first and then appropriately copy your value of
`vec_x` to `a`.) The error also happens for `np.dot` and possibly other
functions.
My system specs:  
macOS 10.13.4 (17E202)  
Python 3.6.4 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit)  
jupyter-notebook 5.4.0  
ipython 6.2.1  
numpy 1.14.2  
gensim 3.4.0
This is a cross post from this jupyter notebook issue (as I really don't know
who's the culprit in the end).
