User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Mac OS X: how to run GUI apps on a headless machine Is there a way to run a GUI app, like iTunes, when not logged in to a computer directly? Thus, I'd like to be able to start a program, then log out, or (preferably) run a GUI program directly from an SSH session when no user is logged in to the console itself.

(Note that I'm not looking for a music player in particular, but a general method of running GUI programs.)

Assistant: You need to set up a VNC server and connect using a client or buy the Apple Remote Desktop.
