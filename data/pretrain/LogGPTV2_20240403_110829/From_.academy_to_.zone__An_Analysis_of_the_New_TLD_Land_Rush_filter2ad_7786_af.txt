### Figure 7: Profitability by Type of TLD
Figure 7 illustrates the profitability of different types of Top-Level Domains (TLDs). The gray line represents the aggregate profitability, while the colored lines represent the profitability for each specific type of TLD.

### Figure 8: Profitability by Registry
Figure 8 shows the profitability of TLDs by registry, focusing on those with the most TLDs. The gray line represents the overall aggregate, and the colored lines represent individual registries.

### Analysis of Initial Cost and Renewal Rate
Figure 6 demonstrates that the initial cost has a more significant impact on short-term profitability compared to the renewal rate. However, both factors are crucial in the long term. Even under the most favorable conditions, with high renewal rates and no additional fees beyond those imposed by ICANN, 10% of TLDs do not become profitable within the first 10 years.

### Factors Affecting TLD Profitability
Given the diversity of registries and domain registration activities, we investigated whether certain features could differentiate between profitable and unprofitable TLDs. We analyzed profitability based on four metrics:
- Lexical string length
- The registry for TLDs belonging to the top four registries, otherwise categorized as "Other"
- The type of registry (generic, community, or geographic)
- Whether the most common registrars sell domains in the TLD

In practice, we found only minor variations in profitability based on these metrics. Below, we present the results for the most significant differentiators: type and registry.

### Profitability by TLD Type
Figure 7 shows the variations in profitability by TLD type. The gray line represents the overall cumulative distribution function (CDF) of profitability, equivalent to the CDFs in Figure 6 with an initial cost of $500,000 and an overall renewal rate of 71%. The remaining lines represent non-overlapping TLD subsets that combine to form the overall set. Although community and geographical TLDs become profitable more quickly than generic TLDs, their small numbers mean that the profitability of generic TLDs closely tracks the overall rate.

### Profitability by Registry
Similarly, Figure 8 illustrates the variations in profitability by registry. Among the large registries, only Uniregistry TLDs become profitable sooner than the average. Our data suggests that owners of multiple TLDs primarily benefit by spreading risk. Many registries manage between one and three TLDs, and these tend to become profitable more quickly than those managed by larger registries.

### Limitations
While profitability is a crucial metric for comparing registries, our methodology has some limitations:

1. **Premium Domain Sales**: Our pricing model does not include premium domain name sales, which can vary significantly. For some TLDs, premium domain sales can generate revenue equal to or greater than standard registrations. This category represents the largest unknown in our model, affecting only the initial purchase and not ongoing renewal revenue.

2. **Price Variability**: We record a single price for each TLD/registrar pair, although prices can change over time. Future studies could address this by periodically regathering pricing data, which would require a more automated method of data collection.

3. **Wholesale Price Estimation**: We estimate wholesale prices as 70% of the lowest price for domains in the TLD. A more accurate estimation of this price is left for future work.

### End User Visits
To complement our registrant-focused analysis, we also examined the new TLD program from an end-user perspective. We used the presence or absence of domains in the Alexa top million as a metric for user visits, disregarding the ranking order.

We split new domain registrations from December 2014 into two sets: one for new TLDs and one for old TLDs. We found 326,974 registrations in new TLDs and 3,461,322 in old TLDs. We compared these sets with the Alexa top million from April 13, 2014, using a newer list to allow new domains time to develop their web presence. Due to the size difference, we report results per hundred thousand new registrations.

### Table 9: New and Old TLDs in Blacklists and Alexa
| TLD Type | Alexa 1M (per 100,000) | Alexa 10K (per 100,000) | URIBL (per 100,000) |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| New      | 88.1                   | 703                     | 1.1                 |
| Old      | 0.3                    | 243                     | 331                 |

New domain registrations in old TLDs are nearly three times more likely to appear in the Alexa top million compared to new TLDs. This ratio is consistent with appearances in the Alexa top ten thousand. While this is a notable difference, it aligns with the proportion of primary registrations described in Section 5.1.

### Blacklist Analysis
We used the URIBL blacklist to indicate abusive behavior, using the same sets of newly registered domains. Table 9 summarizes our results, showing that domains in new TLDs are twice as likely to appear on the URIBL blacklist within the first month. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may be related to the lower prices offered by some registrars for new TLDs.

| TLD    | New Domains | Blacklisted | Percent   |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| link   | 4,087       | 917         | 22.4%     |
| red    | 7,599       | 614         | 8.1%      |

| support| 435         | 3           | 0.7%      |
| website| 7,876       | 49          | 0.6%      |
| country| 1,154       | 7           | 0.6%      |

### Conclusion
ICANN's expansion of the TLD namespace aimed to increase consumer choice and provide more short and memorable domain names. However, our findings suggest that while new TLDs have generated significant revenue for registrars, they have yet to provide the same value to the Internet community as legacy TLDs. Only 15% of domains purchased show behavior consistent with primary registrations, and domain parking drives over 30% of registrations in the new gTLD zone files. Additionally, users visit fewer new domains in new gTLDs, and new domains are more than twice as likely to appear on blacklists within the first month of registration.
