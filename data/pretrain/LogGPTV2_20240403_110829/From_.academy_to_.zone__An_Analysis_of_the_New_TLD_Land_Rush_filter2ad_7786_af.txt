Figure 7: Modeling proﬁtability by type of TLD. The gray line
represents the aggregate, and the colored lines represent the set of
TLDs of the indicated type.
Figure 8: Modeling proﬁtability by registry for the registries with
the most TLDs. The gray line represents the aggregate, with
colored lines representing individual registries.
Figure 6 shows that the initial cost plays a much larger role than
the renewal rate in the short term, but that both parameters are im-
portant in the long term. We ﬁnd that even under the most per-
missive model, with high renewal rates and no fees beyond those
imposed by ICANN, 10% of TLDs still do not become proﬁtable
within the ﬁrst 10 years.
Since there are a wide variety of registries operating new TLDs,
and there is a wide variety of domain registration activity across the
TLDs, we were interested to see if there were features that might
separate proﬁtable and unproﬁtable TLDs. To that end, we com-
pared proﬁtability based on four metrics:
❖ lexical string length;
❖ the registry for TLDs belonging to the top four
registries, otherwise “Other”;
❖ the type of registry (“generic”, “community”, or
“geographic”); and
❖ whether or not the most common registrars all sell
domains in the TLD.
In practice, we only found minor variations in proﬁtability based
on these metrics. We present results for the most signiﬁcant differ-
entiators, type and registry, below.
Figure 7 shows variations in proﬁtability by type of TLD. The
gray line represents the overall proﬁtability CDF. It is equivalent to
the proﬁtability CDFs in Figure 6 with an initial cost of 500,000
USD and an overall renewal rate of 71%. The remaining lines rep-
resent non-overlapping TLD subsets which combine to the same
overall set. Though community and geographical TLDs become
proﬁtable much sooner than generic TLDs, there are so few of them
in comparison that the proﬁtability of generic TLDs still closely
tracks the overall rate.
Similarly, Figure 8 shows variations in proﬁtability by registry.
Of the large registries, only Uniregistry TLDs become proﬁtable
sooner than the average. Instead, our data suggests owners of mul-
tiple TLDs mainly beneﬁt by spreading the risk. Many registries
only manage between one and three TLDs, and those strings tend
to become proﬁtable sooner than most of the large registries.
7.4 Limitations
We see proﬁtability as an important metric with which to com-
pare registries, but our methodology has some limitations. In this
section, we describe the known limitations and their expected im-
pact on the results.
First, our pricing model does not include premium domain name
sales, as described in Section 3.7. For the few TLDs for which
we have seen premium domain revenue reports, these sales vary
considerably. For different TLDs, we have seen the total revenue
from premium domain sales range from $0 to the same amount as
the total revenue of wholesale domains.
It is also plausible that
some TLDs could get more total revenue from premium domain
names than from standard registrations. As a result, this category
represents the largest unknown in our model. Premium domain
names renew for the normal registration cost, so this unknown only
affects the initial upfront purchase of the name and not ongoing
renewal revenue.
Second, for any given TLD/registrar pair, we only record a sin-
gle price, when domain name prices could change over time. To
date we ﬁnd that, after the beginning of general availability, domain
prices do not change very frequently. Future studies could address
this assumption by periodically regathering pricing data. For prac-
tical reasons, doing so would require deploying a more automated
method of gathering prices than we used in this paper.
Finally, we estimate wholesale prices as 70% of the lowest price
for domains in the TLD. We leave a better estimation of this price
to future work.
8. VISITS
As an alternative to our registrant-focused analysis, we also an-
alyze the new TLD program from an end user perspective. In par-
ticular, we want to know whether actual users visit domains in the
new TLDs, and how that compares to similar domains in the old
TLDs. We use a domain’s presence or absence in the Alexa top
million domains as a metric for whether or not users visit it. We do
not consider the ranking order as we only care whether or not the
domain gets trafﬁc at all.
We begin by splitting new domain registrations from December
2014 into two sets, one for domains in the new TLDs and one for
domains in the old TLDs. We ﬁnd 326,974 registrations in Decem-
ber 2014 in the new TLDs, and 3,461,322 in the old TLDs. We
compare these sets with the Alexa top million from April 13, 2014.
We use a newer Alexa list to allow the new domain registrations
time to develop their Web presence. Due to the order of magnitude
size difference between our new registration sets, we report results
per hundred thousand new registrations.

Table 9: The rate at which new domains in the old and new TLDs
appear in blacklists and Alexa. This table only includes domains
registered within the same one-month time window to compare
old and young TLDs on equal terms.
Table 9 summarizes our results. New domain registrations in the
old TLDs are nearly three times more likely to appear in the Alexa
top million when compared to registrations in the new TLDs. This
ratio is also consistent with appearances on the Alexa top ten thou-
sand. While this is a notable difference, it is also consistent with
the proportion of primary registrations described in Section 5.1.
We use a similar method with the URIBL blacklist as an indica-
tor of abusive behavior. We use the same sets of newly registered
domains. We use a blacklist contemporaneous with our registra-
tion data because blacklist operators add abusive domains as soon
as possible. Table 9 summarizes our results.
We ﬁnd that domains in new TLDs are twice as likely to appear
on the URIBL blacklist within the ﬁrst month. Our data does not
reveal why spammers ﬁnd the new TLDs attractive. However, we
can guess based on the registrar pricing data we collected as de-
scribed in Section 3.7. Domains in new TLDs tended to cost more
on average, but individual registrars sometimes sold them for sig-
niﬁcantly reduced prices. In the extreme we found xyz domains
for less than $1 USD per year at some registrars.
Table 10 shows the ten TLDs for which a new registration is
most likely to appear on a blacklist. Domains registered in Decem-
ber 2014 in most TLDs had less than a 1% chance of appearing on
a blacklist in the same month, but the link, red, and rocks TLDs
showed signiﬁcantly higher rates of blacklisting. We found link
domains for as cheap as $1.50 USD, but rocks domains cost at
least $7.99 USD. The characteristics of these domains that consis-
tently contribute towards higher rates of abusive behavior remains
an open question.
9. CONCLUSION
ICANN greatly expanded the TLD name space to increase con-
sumer choice and to allow more domain registrants to get short and
memorable domain names. As we have found in previous TLD
expansions [11, 12], new TLDs can increase primary domain regis-
trations but can also lead to speculation and defensive registrations.
ICANN’s new rapid expansion of the available TLDs gives primary
registrants a lot more choice, but also increases the demands on de-
fensive registrants seeking to protect their marks.
We take a comprehensive approach to understanding how regis-
trants use domain names in ICANN’s new TLD program. We used
data from many sources, including zone ﬁle data available to re-
searchers, extensive crawls of Web and DNS information, and pub-
lic data from ICANN, registries and registrars. We determined that
only 15% of domains purchased by a registrant show behavior con-
sistent with primary registrations and that domain parking drives
over 30% of registrations in the new gTLD zone ﬁles. We use do-
main pricing information to estimate that only half of all registries
have recouped their application fee in wholesale revenue. Simi-
larly, we conservatively estimate that registrants have spent roughly
$89 million USD on domain registrations in the new TLDs. Finally,

we validate the expectation that users visit fewer new domains in
new gTLDs than those in old, and that new domains are more than
twice as likely to appear on a commonly available blacklist within
the ﬁrst month of registration. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest
that new gTLDs, while accruing signiﬁcant revenue for registrars,
have yet to provide value to the Internet community in the same
way as legacy TLDs.
