User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Folder permissions keep changing from www-data to root A folder under the directory /var/www/xml keeps changing permission from www-data toroot, meaning that no php file is able to write into the folder.

I think this happens when I restart the server.

drwxr-xr-x 6 root www-data  4096 Sep 10 13:40 xml

drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data www-data  4096 Sep 10 13:40 xml

How do I make sure this does not happen?

Assistant: I was having the same problem with /var/run/lighttpd set owned by www-data by something instead of lighttpd user. I added it to www-data group but apparently things still don't work sometimes, so I overrided the systemd service script with systemctl edit lighttpd:
/etc/systemd/system/lighttpd.service.d/override.conf
