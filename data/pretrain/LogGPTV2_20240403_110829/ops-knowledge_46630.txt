User: Please explain the process of TCP three-way handshake, and why this process is needed?
Assistant: The process of the TCP three-way handshake is as follows: 1. The first handshake: the client sends a SYN to the server, indicating a request to establish a connection. 2. The second handshake: After receiving the SYN, the server sends an ACK and a SYN, indicating that the request has been received, confirmed and agreed to the connection. 3. The third handshake: After receiving the ACK and SYN from the server, the client sends an ACK, indicating that the confirmation message has been received, and the connection is established successfully. The reason why TCP needs to do this process is to ensure the reliability and stability of data transmission. Before data transmission, the client and server need to establish a TCP connection, and confirm each other's communication capabilities and correctness through a three-way handshake to ensure that the transmitted data can be received and sent correctly. If this process is not carried out, there will be problems such as unstable connection and data loss, which will affect the effectiveness of data transmission.
