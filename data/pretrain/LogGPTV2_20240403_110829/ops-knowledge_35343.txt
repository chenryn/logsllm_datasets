User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why do my folder names contain commas in them? I'm following this tutorial and it says to create folders like this:

mkdir -p /home/demo/public_html/domain2.com/{public,private,log,backup}


when I do this, I get folder names with } and , at the end of their names.

Does that mkdir not work on ubuntu or?

I thought it would create the folders inside the curly braces...

Assistant: That inline expansion syntax is specific to the Bourne shell and its descendants I think (sh, bash, ksh, zsh).  It seems likely that your tutorial is expecting you to be running bash and you are running something else (csh, tcsh?)
