### Ansible Version

### Configuration
- N/A

### Operating System / Environment
- Ubuntu 16.04 (Kernel: 4.4.0-24)

### Summary
An error occurs during the build process of the Debian package from Git sources, preventing the successful creation of the package.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set the release number and build date:
   ```bash
   release_number=$(your call)
   build_date=$(date --rfc-2822)
   ```

2. Clean the Git repository:
   ```bash
   echo "Cleaning"
   cd git-ansible
   git reset --hard
   git clean -fxd :/
   git fetch --progress --prune origin
   git checkout v${release_number}
   ```

3. Copy the Debian control folder to the expected location:
   ```bash
   echo "Copying Debian control folder in the expected location"
   rsync -av --delete packaging/debian .
   ```

4. Modify the `debian/changelog` with the current release and date:
   ```bash
   echo "Modifying debian/changelog with current release & date"
   sed -i '1,6d' debian/changelog
   sed -i "1s/^/ansible (${release_number}) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * ${release_number}\n\n -- Jean-Christophe Manciot   $build_date\n\n/" debian/changelog
   ```

5. Build the Debian package:
   ```bash
   echo "Building"
   dpkg-buildpackage -b -m"Jean-Christophe Manciot "
   ```

### Actual Results
The build process fails with the following error:
```
dh_install -pansible  
dh_install: Cannot find (any matches for) "docs/man/man1/*.1" (tried in ".")
dh_install: ansible missing files: docs/man/man1/*.1
dh_install: missing files, aborting
/usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/debhelper.mk:213: recipe for target 'binary-install/ansible' failed
make: *** [binary-install/ansible] Error 255
dpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules binary gave error exit status 2
```

Full log with version **2.1.1.0-0.1.rc1**:
```
Cannot find any matches for docs-man-man1-*.1.txt
```

### Additional Information
- The issue seems to be related to missing man pages (`docs/man/man1/*.1`) in the source directory.
- This could be due to a misconfiguration or an incomplete source tree.
