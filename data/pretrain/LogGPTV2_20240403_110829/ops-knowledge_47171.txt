### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:54 to 18:07:00 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process (PID: `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) is failing to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` over a period of 116 to 121 seconds. Each failure is followed by a warning that a retry will be attempted shortly.

2. **Resource Manager (RM) Connection Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is experiencing difficulties in connecting to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. It is attempting to reconnect with a retry policy that allows up to 10 retries, each with a 1-second sleep interval.
   - There are multiple `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` messages, indicating that the connection attempts are failing.

3. **Address Changes**:
   - Both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes are detecting address changes. Specifically, the IP address `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170` is being updated to `msra-sa-41` for both port `8030` and `9000`.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Lease Renewal Warnings**:
  - At 18:06:54, 18:06:55, 18:06:56, 18:06:57, 18:06:58, 18:06:59, and 18:07:00, the `LeaseRenewer` process fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` for 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, and 121 seconds, respectively. The system logs a warning and indicates that it will retry shortly.

- **RM Connection Retries**:
  - At 18:06:56, 18:06:58, and 18:07:00, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of up to 10 retries, each with a 1-second sleep interval.
  - Simultaneously, at 18:06:56, 18:06:58, and 18:07:00, there are `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` messages, indicating that the connection attempts are failing.

- **Address Change Warnings**:
  - At 18:06:55, 18:06:56, 18:06:57, 18:06:58, and 18:06:59, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and `LeaseRenewer` processes detect an address change from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030` and from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`, respectively.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with lease renewal and resource manager connectivity, likely exacerbated by the detected address changes. These issues may need to be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the Hadoop cluster.
