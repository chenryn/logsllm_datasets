Message from the PC Chairs of the 
Performance and Dependability Symposium

  It  is  our  pleasure  to  present  to  you  the  program  of  the  2005  Performance  and  Dependability  Symposium 
(PDS’05). 
Since  1995,  the  International  Performance  and  Dependability  Symposium  (IPDS)  has  been  a  high-quality 
international forum for researchers and practitioners to report on the state-of-the-art of the evaluation of the impact 
of  faults  on  the  operation,  in  particular,  the  performance  of  computer  and  communication  systems.  Where  in  the 
early  years  of  PDS,  faults  were  mostly  due  to  malfunctioning  hardware  or  software,  recently,  the  occurrence  of 
malicious faults, or even attacks, has become a major issue of concern as well.  
  This  year’s  PDS  continues  its  tradition  of  being  a  high-quality  conference  bridging  the  gap  between  new 
developments  from  a  methodological  point  of  view,  and  the  application  thereof  on  the  evaluation  of  a  system  in 
terms  of  its  performance  and  dependability  (both  seen  in  a  broad  sense).  In  this  tradition,  PDS  serves the  need of 
both  academia  and  industry.  As  in  previous  years,  we  have  accepted  papers  that  present  further  developments  in 
model-based system evaluation, or that study the performance and dependability of existing or planned systems, be 
it  through  analysis,  simulation,  or  experimentation.  This  mix  of  papers  clearly  positions  PDS  next  to  other,  either 
more systems-oriented conferences, or more methodology-oriented conferences. 
  Upon the call for papers, we received close to 100 full-paper submissions. Each submitted paper was reviewed 
by at least 4 PC members, as well as by an external referee. At the plenary PC meeting, hosted in the Tulip Inn hotel 
in Zaandam, the Netherlands, February 17-18, 2005, the 27 papers you find in the PDS section of this proceedings 
were accepted. As many as 28 PC members took part in this plenary meeting. The selection process has been very 
competitive,  and  even  good  papers  had  to  be  rejected.  The  submission  and  review  process  was  handled  with  the 
web-based START system, set up and maintained at the University of Twente by Jose Martinez; sincere thanks for 
doing a great job on this! Sun Microsystems sponsored the PC meeting financially; thanks for that! 
  We  are  very  proud  to  be  able  to  present  this  strong  PDS  conference  programme  to  you.  It  is,  of  course,  only 
made  possible  through  the  help  of  the  scientific  community  and  the  local  organizers  in  Yokohama.  We  thank  all 
authors  for  submitting  their  papers  to  PDS’05.  By  the  fact  that  we  have  been  quite  selective,  we  have  had  to 
disappoint many authors, unfortunately. We thank all the PC members for their enormous review efforts and their 
time and travel on participating the PC meeting. We thank all the external reviewers for their review efforts as well. 
We  thank  the  DSN  2005  general  chair,  Takashi  Nanya,  as  well  as  the  conference  coordinator,  Tohru  Kikuno,  for 
their  many  and  often  invisible  tasks.  The  general  support  the  PC  chairs  obtained  through  the  DSN  steering 
committee  chair  Paulo  Verissimo,  as  well  as  from  the  PDS  steering  committee  co-chairs  Ravi  Iyer  and  Kishor 
Trivedi was very helpful and appreciated. Finally, we thank all of you, for being here in Yokohama, and for making 
PDS a successful and enjoyable symposium.
