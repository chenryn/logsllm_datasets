## Preface

Security in information technology has long been perceived as a niche, technical topic, often reserved for those with deep knowledge of networks, packets, and algorithms. However, as organizations increasingly migrate their workloads, applications, and infrastructure to the cloud, the responsibility for security has shifted, impacting both experts and novices alike.

AWS provides a robust set of controls to secure customer workloads, but many customers are not fully aware of their own security responsibilities and the necessary controls they need to implement. This book aims to bridge this gap by providing comprehensive, easy-to-understand guidance, supported by real-life examples, figures, and screenshots, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their background in security.

By the end of this book, readers will understand how to enable continuous security, auditing, and compliance in AWS using automation tools and services. The book covers the entire landscape of security in AWS, including all aspects of end-to-end software and hardware security, logging, auditing, and compliance. Readers can apply the best practices outlined in this book to master security in their AWS environment.

## Chapter 1: Overview of Security in AWS

AWS offers a wide array of services, tools, and methods to secure your cloud journey, including access control, firewalls, encryption, logging, monitoring, and compliance. These services cater to various use cases and scenarios, ensuring end-to-end security, logging, auditing, and compliance in the cloud environment.

- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Controls access and actions for AWS users and resources.
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Secures infrastructure by creating a virtual network similar to an on-premises data center.
- **Key Management Services (KMS):** Facilitates key management and encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **AWS Shield and Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects against common threats like DDoS attacks.
- **AWS Config, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch:** Supports logging, auditing, and configuration management.
- **AWS Artifact:** Provides compliance documents on demand.

This book explains these services and methods, enabling you to automate security controls using AWS Lambda, Simple Notification Service (SNS), and other services. We will also explore the differences between compliance and security, and how to implement continuous security and compliance in AWS.

### Chapter Overview

- **Shared Security Responsibility Model:** Understand the fundamental principle of AWS security and the responsibilities of both AWS and its customers.
- **AWS Security Responsibilities:** Detailed look at AWS's responsibilities across physical, network, and other security areas.
- **Customer Security Responsibilities:** Focus on protecting credentials, data security, and access control.
- **Security Features of Your AWS Account:** Overview of built-in security features.
- **Security Services and Features:** Introduction to KMS, CloudWatch, Shield, CloudTrail, and more.
- **Learning Resources:** Links to AWS documentation, white papers, blogs, tutorials, and solutions.

### AWS Shared Security Responsibility Model

The evolution of cloud computing has transformed security from an impediment to a major driver for moving to the cloud. Executives and decision-makers from various industries, including defense, banking, healthcare, and payment card industry, now vouch for the reliability and cost-effectiveness of cloud security.

- **Gartner Prediction:** By 2020, a corporate no-cloud policy will be as rare as a no-internet policy today.
- **Global Cloud Index (GCI) Forecast:** Cloud will account for 92% of data center traffic by 2020.
- **IDC Insight:** The current cloud-first strategy is driving rapid cloud adoption.

AWS is designed to be flexible and secure, removing many traditional IT security burdens. It ensures customer privacy and resource segregation, with built-in security features. Every customer benefits from AWS's global infrastructure and security processes, which comply with stringent requirements.

### Shared Responsibility Model for Infrastructure Services

- **Infrastructure Services:** Includes compute services like Amazon EC2, EBS, Elastic Load Balancing, and VPC. You design and build your own secure network, controlling the operating system, firewall rules, and identity management.
- **Container Services:** Managed services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EMR, and RDS. You configure firewall rules and access using IAM.
- **Abstracted Services:** Messaging, email, NoSQL database, and storage services. AWS manages the underlying components, and you share the infrastructure.

### Building on AWS Secure Global Infrastructure

You install, configure, and manage your operating systems and platforms in the AWS cloud, similar to on-premises data centers. You then deploy applications and store data, configuring security measures like encryption. AWS provides tools and technologies to protect data at rest and in transit, which will be detailed in Chapter 4.

When launching an Amazon EC2 instance, you can access it using secure protocols like SSH for Linux or RDP for Windows. Authentication at the operating system level is required, and you can set up multiple authentication methods, such as Microsoft Active Directory, X.509 certificate authentication, or local accounts.

AWS provides EC2 key pairs consisting of a public and private key for secure authentication. These RSA key pairs are industry-standard and essential for accessing and managing EC2 instances securely.
