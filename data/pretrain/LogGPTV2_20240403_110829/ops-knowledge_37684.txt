It aims to improve the quality and efficiency of software delivery through the collaboration and optimization of all links in the software development and deployment process, so that software development and operations Dimensions are more efficient and elegant. Compared with traditional IT operations, DevOps advocates integrating development and operation and maintenance into one process, allowing development and operation and maintenance personnel to work together, and eliminating barriers between them. DevOps often uses automation technologies, including automated testing, automated building and deployment, etc., to minimize manual errors and improve delivery speed.

In general, the goal of DevOps is to continuously improve the quality of software and the ability to deliver quickly while providing more flexible IT services.
