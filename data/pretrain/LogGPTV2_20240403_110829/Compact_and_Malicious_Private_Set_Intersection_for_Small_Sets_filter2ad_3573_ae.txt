In [46] a bound of 𝑛′ = 6𝑛 is stated; in [47] a bound of 𝑛′ = 4𝑛 is
stated; and in [43] a range of bounds 𝑛′ = 2.4𝑐𝑛 for 𝑐 ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}
is given for different parameters.
5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
5.1 Implementation
In order to evaluate the performance of our PSI protocol, we built
and evaluated an implementation. Our complete implementation is
available on GitHub: https://github.com/osu-crypto/MiniPSI. Below,
we discuss how the various components were instantiated.
Key Agreement. We instantiate DHKA using elliptic curve groups,
and hash 𝑔𝑎𝑏 with SHA2. As mentioned previously, this variant of
DHKA is non-malleable (Definition 3.3) under the ODH assumption.
An elliptic curve consists of the solutions (𝑥, 𝑦) in a field F𝑞
to the Weierstrass equation 𝑦2 = 𝑥3 + 𝐴𝑥2 + 𝐵 or Montgomery
equation 𝑦2 = 𝑥3 + 𝐴𝑥2 + 𝑥. Depending on the curve parameters,
EC shows different shapes on the plane. In this work, we choose
the Curve25519 Montgomery curve, since it is recommended for
elligator [1]. This Curve25519 is defined over 𝐺𝐹(𝑞 = 2255 − 19)
and its curve parameter 𝐴 has the value 486662.
We implement the elligator encoding based on [6]. The encoding
takes a curve point and outputs a pseudorandom string of 256 bits.
The point (𝑥, 𝑦) has an inverse map if it satisfies two conditions: the
𝑥 value is not equal to the curve parameter 𝐴; and−2𝑥(𝑥+𝑎) must be
a square. Therefore, we keep sampling points until these conditions
are hold. According [1, 6] and confirmed by our experiment, the
success probability is 1
2. The elligator encoding of such a valid point
2 )( 𝑥
is defined by 𝑟 =
2 , otherwise,
𝑏 = −1.
