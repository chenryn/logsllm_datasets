User: Please generate a network topology map, marking each device and its IP address
Assistant: Sorry, I cannot generate a network topology map. The network topology diagram represents the connection relationship between devices, and it is usually created by network engineers using professional tools. If you need help, I can provide basic concepts and related technical knowledge about network topology diagrams.
