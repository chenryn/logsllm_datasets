### Duplicated DKIM Keys Across Different Domains

The duplicated keys are predominantly shared across two different domains (1,161 groups). However, there are also larger groups of domains sharing the same key. For instance, between three and 13 different domains, there are 630 groups. The number of groups decreases to 46 for domains ranging from 14 to 30, and 44 groups contain over 30 domains. Appendix A, Figure 1, provides a detailed view of the nine largest groups, including the number of domains and the top five domains according to Alexa. Through manual investigation, we sought to understand more about these individual groups.

One specific key was used by 1,515 different second-level domains, forming the largest group of domains sharing the same key (DKIM Key Group 1). This key was frequently displayed on websites explaining the functionality of DKIM, often used as an example [36]. The reason for so many domain owners using this exemplary key is unclear, as the domains cannot test the functionality of DKIM without the private key. If the private key is known, anyone can sign messages for those 1,515 domains, which poses a significant security risk.

In DKIM Key Group 2, four out of five displayed domains have a CNAME record for `s1._domainkey.[domain]` pointing to `s1acc903393.domainkey.freshdesk.com`, which in turn points to a subdomain of `sendgrid.net`. This indicates that Freshdesk, a customer service software, is being used, and it provides DKIM for its customers through Sendgrid. Similarly, in DKIM Key Group 4, all domains have a CNAME record pointing to a subdomain of `sendgrid.net`, indicating that they are also Sendgrid customers. Instructions for configuring DKIM with Sendgrid are available online [35].

For DKIM Key Group 8, all displayed domains have a CNAME record pointing to a subdomain of `atlassian.net`, which further points to a subdomain of `sendgrid.net`. Atlassian, a provider of collaborative work and customer support solutions, uses Sendgrid for its customers' DKIM configuration [3].

All domains in DKIM Key Group 3 belong to `jimdo.com`, a provider of website development tools and internet services. They share the same nameservers, suggesting that all domains in the Jimdo zone use the same key, as Jimdo manages the email service for all these domains. Similarly, all displayed domains in DKIM Key Group 5 have nameservers of `mchost.ru` in their NS records, indicating that they are managed by Mchost, a Russian web service provider.

For DKIM Key Groups 6, 7, and 9, we do not have additional information on why they share the same key.

### Summary of Shared DKIM Keys

- **Groups 2, 4, and 8**: These groups use Sendgrid to set up DKIM. In Groups 2 and 8, intermediary software (Freshdesk and Atlassian) is involved.
- **Group 1**: Uses a DKIM key from a tutorial, likely unintentionally.
- **Groups 3 and 5**: Related to web service providers (Jimdo and Mchost).
- **Groups 6, 7, and 9**: No further information available.

In some cases, such as with Sendgrid, Jimdo, or Mchost, sharing the DKIM key is not critical as long as the domain owners trust these services. However, the case of Group 1 is more concerning, as it likely occurred unintentionally. The groups without further information are also noteworthy, as the shared duplicate key may not be intended.

### Higher-Ranked Domains with Shared DKIM Keys

Most domains using shared duplicate keys are generally ranked low. However, some higher-ranked domains like `yahoo.com`, `adobe.com`, `symantec.com`, and `myspace.com` are included (see Table 6). These well-known domains share the same key across different groups within the same company:

- **yahoo.com**: Shares the same key with other Yahoo sites (e.g., `yahoo.com.tw`, `ymail.com`, `yahoo-inc.com`) and two other domains (`sky.com` and `ovi.com`). The key is 2048 bits, and the selector is always `s2048`.
- **live.com**: Shares its DKIM key with five other domains, four of which are Microsoft services (e.g., `outlook.com`, `msn.com`, `onedrive.com`, `hotmail.com`) with the selector `selector1`. One domain, `nuangel.net`, shares the key but has no apparent connection to Microsoft.
- **yandex.ru**: Shares the same key with other Yandex domains (e.g., `ya.ru`, `yandex.by`, `yandex.kz`), all using `mail` as the selector string.
- **nytimes.com**: Shares the same key with 70 other domains, including `salesforce.com`, `hbo.com`, and `rollingstone.com`, all using the selector `s1`.

### Threats to Validity

A first limitation of our email analysis method is that our email archive did not include emails from all the top 1 million domains, leading to a biased sample. A second limitation is that our generated selector list contains only 3,498 selectors, excluding any randomly generated selectors. More extensive lists might yield better results, but we aimed to achieve comparable results with the resources available.

### Combination of Authentication Methods

Based on the August 2019 scan of the Alexa list, 563,474 domains have SPF records, 94,244 have DMARC records, and 113,855 have DKIM records, including invalid ones. Only 30,425 (about 3%) domains use DMARC, SPF, and DKIM together. The percentage is low, and a higher adoption rate is necessary to effectively combat fake emails. SPF and DKIM are used by approximately 10% (98,276 domains) of all investigated domains. DMARC and SPF are used by about 9% (90,895 domains), and DMARC and DKIM by about 3% (30,958). This confirms that when DMARC is used, SPF is almost always implemented (over 96%). When DKIM is used, SPF is often available (about 86%). The combination of DMARC and DKIM is rare, similar to the use of all three methods together.

### Discussion and Lessons Learned

Using either SPF or DKIM alone makes spoofing attacks more difficult but does not completely prevent them. SPF is the most frequently implemented method, with an adoption rate of around 50%. This rate has improved significantly since previous studies conducted about five years ago [11, 13]. Highly ranked domains, especially in the Top 100, show a high saturation of SPF usage, with 90% of these domains using SPF.

The analysis of governmental domains revealed strong differences, likely due to legal directives enforcing security standards. Political regulations can help increase email security. We recommend implementing at least one DNS TXT record with the DMARC Reject policy to prevent misuse of the domain, even without a mail server.

DMARC and DKIM implementation is only about a tenth. Despite this, we observed a significant increase in DMARC adoption. However, many services still only implement SPF, making impersonation possible for a large fraction of domains. Major mail providers are implementing these techniques better than average services on the Internet.

DMARC offers adequate protection against spoofing only in combination with SPF and DKIM. The number of services implementing all three methods is low, at about 3%. Comparing our surveyed mail providers with the top 1 million domains, we find that email providers are better positioned than the overall average.

While more people are adopting DNS-based email authentication, the overall spread among the top 1 million domains is still improvable. There are clear differences per TLD, with .cn showing a significant increase. We hope this work will encourage domain operators to check and improve their email authentication methods.

### Ethical Considerations

We analyzed publicly available information for SPF and DMARC and reported misconfigurations to the affected parties. For DKIM, we did not collect public information, particularly avoiding weak keys. We did not disclose domains using 384-bit keys, as they can be easily factorized. While 768-bit DKIM keys are weak, we believe disclosing these domains is justifiable, as an attacker would need significantly more resources to factorize these keys successfully.

### Related Work

Several studies have examined email security, focusing on SPF and DMARC. The first paper on SPF and anti-phishing protocols was published by Gorling in 2007 [16], revealing that only 1.6% of .se domains implemented SPF. Durumeric et al. [11] and Foster et al. [13] published studies in 2015 on the security of the email system, covering SPF, DMARC, TLS, and certificate evaluation. Hu and Wang [19] analyzed spoofing attacks and the mechanisms to prevent them, while Hu et al. [18] explored the reasons for the low adoption rate of anti-spoofing protocols.

Our study extends these works by observing the evolution of protocols over time and providing deeper analyses. Although there are good measurement studies available, none are as extensive as ours. We intend to continue this research and examine the ongoing evolution of these protocols.

### Conclusion

This paper empirically examines DNS-based email authentication methods, revealing progress in deployment and issues such as misconfigurations, weak keys, and shared duplicate keys. We expect this work to improve the adoption of SMTP authentication extensions by highlighting the current state of email authentication.
