The duplicated keys are mostly shared across two different
domains only (1161 groups). However, even larger groups
of domains with the same key exist. Between three and 13
different domains there are still 630 groups. Between 14 and
30, the number of groups is reduced to 46. Over 30 domains
are in 44 groups. Figure 1 in Appendix A features the nine
largest groups with the number of domains and five higher-
ranked domains, according to Alexa. By manual search, we
tried to learn more about the individual groups. One specific
key was used by 1,515 different second-level domains, which
represent the biggest group of domains sharing the same key
(DKIM Key Group 1). Interestingly, this key was displayed
on multiple websites where the functionality of DKIM was
explained, and this key was used as an exemplary DKIM
key [36]. The reason why so many domain owners used this
exemplary key is unclear, as the domains cannot test the
functionality of DKIM if they do not possess the private key.
Otherwise, if the private key is known, everyone can sign
messages for those 1,515 domains.
At DKIM Key Group 2, four of five displayed domains
have a CNAME record for s1._domainkey.[domain] which
points to s1acc903393.domainkey.freshdesk.com. This
again points to a domainkey subdomain of sendgrid.net. In
this case, Freshdesk [14], a customer service software, is used,
which in turn provides DKIM for its customers using Send-
grid. The same applies for DKIM Key Group 4: all domains
have a CNAME record pointing to a domainkey subdomain
of sendgrid.net. These are thus again Sendgrid customers. A
description of how to configure DKIM at Sendgrid is available
online [35].
For DKIM Key Group 8, all displayed domains have a
domainkey CNAME subdomain pointing to a domainkey
subdomain of atlassian.net, which further points to a subdo-
main of sendgrid.net. Atlassian provides software solutions
for collaborative work and customer support. The domains
in this group are Atlassian customers who have configured
DKIM by using them. Atlassian, in turn, uses Sendgrid [3].
The domains in DKIM Key Group 3 all belong to jimdo.com.
Jimdo is a provider of website development tools and Inter-
net services. They all use the same nameservers, so it indi-
cates that all domains in the zone of Jimdo use the same key,
because jimdo.com also manages the email service for all
domains in this zone. Similarly, all displayed domains from
DKIM Key Group 5 contain nameservers of mchost.ru in their
NS records. Mchost is a Russian provider of web services.
For DKIM Key Groups 6, 7, and 9, we have no additional
information on why they share the same key.
To sum up, we have three groups (2, 4, and 8) where send-
grid.net was used to set up DKIM. In two cases with interme-
diary software (groups 2 and 8), thus there are three different
duplicate DKIM keys used multiple times. Then we have one
group (1) using a DKIM key from a tutorial and two groups (3
and 5) which are related to web service providers. For three
groups (6, 7, and 9), we have no further information as to why
the same key is used. In some cases, e.g., Sendgrid, Jimdo,
or Mchost, sharing the DKIM key is not security critical as
long as the domain owners trust these services/providers.
The case of Group 1 is more critical as this is likely to have
happened unintentionally. The groups without further infor-
mation are also remarkable, as a shared duplicate key may
not be intended as well.
As expected, most of the domains using a shared dupli-
cate key are in general ranked low. However, some higher-
ranked domains like yahoo.com, adobe.com, and also known
domains like symantec.com, and myspace.com are included
(see Table 6). However, with the somewhat more well-known
domains, it should be noted that they share the same key
across different groups in the same company:
• In the case of yahoo.com, this domain shares the same
key with other Yahoo sites (yahoo.com.tw, ymail.com,
yahoo-inc.com, yahoomail.com, and yahoo.co.id) and
two other domains, sky.com and ovi.com. It is a 2048
bit key, and the selector is always s2048.
• The domain live.com shares its DKIM key with five
other domains. In four cases, these are Microsoft ser-
vices (outlook.com, msn.com, onedrive.com, and hot-
mail.com) each with the selector String selector1. In
one case, these domains also share the key with nuan-
gel.net. We did not find a connection to Microsoft for
this domain.
• The domain yandex.ru also shares its key with other
domains associated with Yandex (ya.ru, yandex.by, and
yandex.kz). All use mail as selector string.
• Another interesting domain is nytimes.com, which
shares the same key with 70 other domains. These

domains include salesforce.com, hbo.com, and rolling-
stone.com. All use the same selector string s1.
• A last finding is that ebay.com is using three selec-
tors dkim, google, and s1 and adobe.com is using two
selectors default, and s1.
Overall, we observe that many cases where the same key
is used multiple times are not critical because most domains
with duplicate keys belong to the same organization.
5.5.6 Threats to Validity. A first limitation of the email anal-
ysis method is that our email archive did not contain emails
from all the top 1 million domains. Thus, our analyzed email
dump is biased because we do not have representative email
users, especially with the communication partners in the
Linux kernel email dump. A second limitation is that our
generated selector list contains only 3,498 selectors. Thus,
it did not include any randomly generated selector. Better
results might need more extensive lists. However, we tried
to get as comparable results as possible by combining both
approaches to the best of our ability at a reasonable expense.
5.6 Combination of Authentication
Methods
Based on the scan from August 2019 of the Alexa list, 563,474
domains have SPF records, 94,244 domains have DMARC
records, and 113,855 domains have DKIM records, including
invalid records. Finally, we consider the use of the studied
technologies in combination based on the scan results from
August 2019. Only 30,425 (about 3%) domains use DMARC,
SPF, and DKIM together. The percentage is comparatively
low and should be much higher to make fake emails more
difficult. SPF and DKIM use almost 10% (98,276 domains)
of all investigated domains. DMARC and SPF use about 9%
(90,895 domains) and DMARC and DKIM about 3% (30,958).
This shows that if DMARC is used in almost all cases, SPF
is also implemented (more than 96%). If DKIM is used, SPF
RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain
is often also available (about 86%). DMARC in combination
with DKIM is a rather rare case quite comparable with all
three methods together. This confirms the results of our first
case study (see Section 3) that generally, when a method is
used, it is SPF. If at least two methods are used, SPF is in
most cases one of these methods.
6 DISCUSSION AND LESSONS LEARNED
As discussed in Section 3.2, using either SPF or DKIM alone
makes spoofing attacks more difficult, but does not com-
pletely prevent them. We observed that SPF is the most fre-
quently implemented method in practice, and even the adop-
tion rate of around 50% valid records might not be satisfac-
tory. Nevertheless, obviously the adoption rate has improved
since the last measurement studies which were performed
about five years ago [11, 13]. This increase is statistically
significant showing that more and more domain operators
are using SPF. Another takeaway is that particularly popular
(highly ranked domains) use SPF much more than all the
others. There even seems to be a certain saturation in the
Top 100 domains in particular, where 90% of the domains
use SPF, as we could not detect any changes in use over the
entire measurement period.
The analysis of adoption rates of governmental domains
of different countries revealed strong differences, which are
likely caused by binding legal directives which enforce an
adoption of security standards. It seems like political regula-
tions help to increase the security of emails significantly. In
certain areas, such a legal enforcement could enable faster
adoption and reduce the risk of email spoofing and related
attacks. We recommend domain holders to implement at
least one DNS TXT record with the DMARC Reject policy to
prevent misuse of the domain, even without a mail server
they run themselves.
DKIM and DMARC implementation is only about a tenth.
Nevertheless, we were also able to measure a significant
increase at DMARC. This proves that there is a lot of progress
in this area as well. However, the bottom line shows that
many services only implement SPF so that impersonation
is still possible for a large fraction of domains. In the end,
we are still far away from stopping the spam problem with
this methods. However, it is encouraging that the major mail
providers are implementing the techniques much better than
the average services available on the Internet.
DMARC only offers adequate protection against spoof-
ing in combination with SPF and DKIM. The number of
services which implement all three email-based mail authen-
tication methods is shallow at about three percent. If we
again compare the results of our surveyed mail providers
with all the top 1 million domains, we notice that the email
364RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain
Tatang, et al.
providers are significantly better positioned than the overall
average.
Even though we could show that more and more people
are taking care of DNS based email authentication, the over-
all spread on the top 1 million lists is still improvable as
it was five years ago. Considering only the top 100 or top
1.000 domains, a certain saturation is reached there and thus
the use of the methods in this cases is satisfactory. There
are also clear differences per TLD, for example .cn with a
huge increase. We hope that this work will be noticed as a
kind of wake up call for all domain operators to check their
email authentication methods and configurations, and that a
further increase in usage will be achieved in the near future.
We argue that our measurements should be continued
regularly to record further changes over time. In addition,
we should try to raise awareness of the issue of email security
among domain operators. More qualitative studies like the
work by Hu et al. [18] on the use of security mechanisms
may also provide further insights and findings in the field of
email security in the next years.
6.1 Ethical Considerations
In scope of our study, we analyzed publicly available infor-
mation for SPF and DMARC. We have not exploited mis-
configurations we found and reported them to the affected
parties. When investigating DKIM, we did not collect public
information. An attacker could exploit especially weak keys.
For this reason, we did not state the domains which use a
384-bit key as such short keys can easily be factorized even
with limited resources. Even though domains with 768-bit
DKIM keys are weak, we think that the disclosure of these
domains is justifiable, as an attacker would need significantly
more resources to factorize these keys successfully.
7 RELATED WORK
Email security measurements. There are a few measure-
ments works in the area of email security, and also the aspect
of authentication was considered in prior work, in particular
for SPF and DMARC. To the best of our knowledge, the first
paper dealing explicitly with SPF and other anti-phishing
protocols was published by Gorling in 2007 [16] one year
after publication of SPFv1 in RFC 4408. An analysis among
the .se domains revealed that only 1.6% out of 385,862 do-
mains implemented SPF. An exclusion of domains without
MX record increased the number minimally to around 1.9%.
Back in 2015, Durumeric et al. [11] and Foster et al. [13]
published studies on the security of the email system. Du-
rumeric et al. covered the authentication methods SPF/D-
MARC. They analyzed the security configurations of top
email providers based on SMTP connections from and to
the Google mail server. Foster et al. evaluated the security
of the email system and mechanisms that can protect the
confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of email messages.
In particular, they analyzed the support of SPF and DMARC
of the most common email providers. The analysis also cov-
ers the TLS protocol and the evaluation of the certificates
of the email server. We do not only update the current state
but extend these works by especially observing the evolu-
tion of the protocols over time to recognize that continuous
progress is made but the overall adoption is still improvable.
Thus, to give this a further push, we argue that it is time to
publish more work in this area. The DKIM analysis examines
the topic from a different perspective and is therefore not
comparable directly. Recent work from Hu and Wang from
2018 [19] contains an analysis of spoofing attacks and which
mechanisms can prevent these kinds of attacks. In particu-
lar, 35 email providers were analyzed and checked which
protocols they have implemented to stop phishing or spoof-
ing attacks. We also extend this work with deeper analyses
and focus more on the development than the current status.
The most recent work is also from Hu et al. from 2018 [18].
In this work, the authors analyze why the adoption rate of
anti-spoofing protocols is still low; for this purpose, a user
study with nine administrators was conducted. In contrast,
we perform a large-scale empirical study on SPF, DMARC,
and DKIM adoption in practice. We think that in the future
more qualitative studies should be done on this topic.
Although there are various good measurement studies
available on this topic, they are not as extensive as our study.
Moreover, we argue that it is necessary to revisit this topic
since previous measuring efforts are already several years
old and the Internet with DNS and email communication has
evolved rapidly. We intend to continue the existing research
and especially to examine the evolution over time of the in-
vestigated protocols. Especially because fake emails are still a
major Internet problem and through the publication of bind-
ing political directives and recommendations, a lot changed
recently. Thus, it is reasonable to update and also enhance
our understanding in this area. Additionally, awareness of
these protocols needs to be improved. For example, we are
not aware of any study of DKIM keys used in practice. Other
existing studies always analyze DKIM from a different point
of view (e.g., by analyzing email dumps) as we do and there
is no one capable of giving a lower bound of DKIM usage
in general. However, further email attacks like email header
injection [6] or spam emails without spoofing [10] are not
considered. Research dealing with email security on the ap-
plication side (S/MIME, OpenPGP) is also available [28, 30],
but our study examines the server-side.
DNS measurements. Many works measure various aspects
of DNS. For example, Rijswijk-Deij et al. discussed the chal-
lenges for active measurements in DNS [43]. Some works
365The Evolution of DNS-based Email Authentication:
Measuring Adoption and Finding Flaws
look at the infrastructure of DNS and analyze security and
privacy aspects [1, 24], as well as works that study DNS
manipulations in particular [26, 29] or works focusing on
DNS security extensions [7–9, 37]. Others consider miscon-
figured servers, DNS tunneling or certain resource record
types [31, 38, 39]. In our work, we measure a still so far
neglected but important DNS aspect of DNS-based email
authentication.
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we empirically examined different DNS-based
email authentication methods. We found that progress was
made in terms of deployment (significant increase in use of
the mechanisms). Additionally, we revealed different issues
such as misconfigurations, weak keys, or shared duplicate
keys. We expect this work with a focus on email authentica-
tion to further improve the adoption of SMTP authentication
extensions by demonstrating the still poor overall adoption.
