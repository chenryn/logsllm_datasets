User: I have a bottle+mongo application running in openshift. when I git-clone the application to my local computer neither the database nor the env-variables get download on my computer --just the  python files. Should I have to mimic the mongo part in my local computer to developed locally? Or I missing something here.
Assistant: Yes. You have to run your own Mongodb server locally or port forward and use the OPENSHIFT Mongodb.
