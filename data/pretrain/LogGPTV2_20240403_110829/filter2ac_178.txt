**Title: "We Are About to Land": How CloudDragon Transforms a Cyber Nightmare into Reality**

On October 27, 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the United States, in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Defense's Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), issued an alert regarding the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of the North Korean APT group, Kimsuky.

Two years prior, at TheSAS2018, TeamT5 presented our research on the group known as CloudDragon. Through continuous monitoring, we have observed significant operational differences that justify dividing this entity into two distinct groups: CloudDragon and KimDragon. Additionally, we have identified the adoption of new techniques and tools, including:

1. **Supply Chain Attacks**
2. **Cross-Platform Attacks**
3. **Advanced Phishing Tactics**

In this presentation, we will delve into the key operations carried out by CloudDragon. More importantly, we will explore potential future attack scenarios, providing valuable insights for defense and detection strategies.
