     - Docker Compose
   - **Instructions:** Follow the provided Dockerfile to build and run the WebApp in a container.

2. **Virtual Machine (VM):**
   - **Description:** We will provide you with a VirtualBox VM (in .ova format) that contains the code and can build and run the WebApp.
   - **Requirements:**
     - VirtualBox
     - VM Image (download from [this link]($OVA_LINK))
   - **Instructions:** Import the .ova file into VirtualBox and follow the instructions to run the WebApp.

3. **TeamViewer:**
   - **Description:** We will provide you with remote access to a VM that contains the code and can build and run the WebApp.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Latest TeamViewer Client
   - **Instructions:** Connect to the provided VM using TeamViewer and follow the instructions to run the WebApp.

4. **Direct Code Execution:**
   - **Description:** We will provide you with the source code and a shell script to install all dependencies on your device.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Linux or Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed
   - **Instructions:** Run the provided shell script to install the necessary dependencies and then build and run the WebApp.

**Next Steps:**

- At the beginning of the interview, we will ask you which option you prefer and provide you with the corresponding source code.

|         | 40-50 | 3            | No Answer    |               |

**Drawing Task Results:**

| XSS Type?                | Inline or External Payload? | Who Executes Payload? | What Can Happen?                        | Who Enforces CSP? | What is Mitigated?        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Stored Server-Side       | Inline                      | Browser               | Leak from Browser to evil.com           | Browser           | Script execution          |
| Reflected Server-Side    | External                    | Server                | Leak from Server to evil.com            | Server            | Script loading            |
| Both Server-Side         |                             |                       | Impersonate victim, Cryptomining        | Not mentioned     | Only exfiltration         |
|                          |                             |                       |                                         |                   |                           |

**Final Codebook:**

- **Demography:**
  - Motivation: PenTest/Consulting, Role Model, Reputation, Additional Security Layer, XSS Mitigation, Framing Control, Security Training, Build Pipeline Warning
  - Implications: Financial, Disincentive: Security as Secondary Goal, Built-in Security Features, Financial Consequences, Benefit: Re-evaluate Resources, Re-evaluate Application Structure

- **Perception of CSP:**
  - Additional Security Layer, Secondary Security Factor, XSS Mitigation, Resource Control, Framing Control, TLS Enforcement, Data Connection Control, CSRF Defense

- **Knowledge Gaps:**
  - TLS Enforcement, XSS, Framing Control, CSP Enforcement, CSP Concept

- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Click-Jacking (deployed XFO), Session Hijacking, XSS, MitM (deployed HSTS), Data Exfiltration (Magecart)

- **Drawing Task:**
  - Stored Server-side XSS, Stored Client-side XSS, Reflected Server-side XSS, Reflected Client-side XSS

- **Iterative Deployment Strategies:**
  - In-the-field Testing, Restrictive RO-Policy, Restrictive Enforcement Policy, Start with generated CSP, Externalize Inline Code, Externalize Events, Code Hashing, Event Hashing, Nonces, Lax CSP, CSP Integral Part of Development, Self-host 3rd-Party Code, One general CSP, Separate CSP for Subpages, Remove Dependencies, Use script-src-attr, Use unsafe-inline as Fallback, Changing Functionality, Functionality > Security

- **Tools:**
  - CSP Evaluation (Google CSP Evaluator, security-headers.io), CSP Report Evaluation (sentry.io, report-uri.com, DIY), Developer Tools of Browser, CSP Preprocessor, Code Hashing

- **Roadblocks:**
  - 3rd-Party Libraries (e.g., Angular), Websocket, 3rd-Party Services (e.g., Google/Youtube), Legacy Code, Different Development Teams (Restricted Code Access), Browser Console Inconsistency, Browser Extension Features, False Positive Reports, Amount of Reports, CSP Maintenance, Engineering Effort, Complexity of CSP, Framework Support (DIY), Insufficient Error Reports

- **Information Sources:**
  - Mozilla Development Network, Blogs (e.g., Scott Helme), Stack Overflow, W3C Specification, content-security-policy.com, Conferences (e.g., OWASPday)
