an event detection algorithm from Twitter through dynamic query
expansion. They constructed events by collecting tweets based on
the similarity of dependency graphs between a tweet and a query.
They expanded an initial query set iteratively as collecting tweets
with high similarity and then specified events from the expanded
queries. Although both approaches are interesting, they have some
limitations to quickly identify an event. They both require a large
volume of tweets for an event to be detected. It means that both
methods are likely to fail to detect events early in cases when it
takes time for events to be mentioned enough. It also means that if
mentions about some critical security events never reach a big num-
ber over several days, both methods may not detect such events. Of
course, one can apply both methods to capture events with small
mentions, but there would be a lot of false positives. According
to Petrović et al. [38], a first story detection yields an incredible
amount of new stories each day, most of which would be of no in-
terest to anyone. Thus, they focus on detection of significant events
that are mentioned by a lot of people. Khadpur et al. [19] reduce the
false positive rate than Le Sceller et al. [29] by iteratively specifying
events through query expansion. However, queries for events of a
few mentions are likely to be expanded less than 2 iterations, which
leads a lot of events with a high false positive rate.
There are other event detection methods that do not require a
large volume of tweets for an event to be detected. Ritter et al. [40]
suggested a seed-based weakly supervised method for extracting
cybersecurity events from Twitter. However, their method suffers
from many false negatives due to its strong dependency on named
entity recognition (NER). The accuracy of NER [39] for entities of
interest (e.g., product and company) is not high yet, as its recent
application [49] showed that only 377,468 tweets remained among
976,180 tweets containing the keyword “vulnerability” after remov-
ing tweets without named entities. This leads that many tweets
are likely to be dropped from event candidates. Mittal et al. [34]
proposed an ontology-based alert generation system for cybersecu-
rity threats dispersed on Twitter. They constructed a knowledge
base system from the existing cybersecurity ontologies like unified
cybersecurity ontology (UCO) [46] and DBpedia [23]. Although this
approach enables to collect the extra information about a triggered
event as well as make a predictive inference about the event by
discovering hidden links, its performance highly depends on the
information coverage of a knowledge base system. This limits its
use in practice. Recently, Sapienza et al. [44] proposed a simple
event detection method based on new words for early event detec-
tion. However, it can only detect events containing new terms. This
results in a failure of sensing important events since not all the
emerging events are described by new terms. For example, there
may be no new terms to express Spectre, Dirty cow, and Heartbleed
vulnerabilities.
3 TWITTER AS A DATA SOURCE
There are a lot of threat-related information feeds. Ideally, monitor-
ing all the data feeds is the best for early event detection. However,
there is no generic event detection algorithm that works for any
data feeds. One may wonder which data source is a good start. Thus,
we evaluate which data source is good to monitor for early secu-
rity event detection. We have explored the timelines of mentions
about a sample of cybersecurity events which occurred in 2018 over
various data sources from mainstream news to developer forum.
Setup. We selected 105 security events1 which consisted of 12 ran-
somware attacks, 13 botnet attacks, 13 other malware attacks, 12
DDoS attacks, 11 phishing attacks, 6 (vulnerability targeting) ex-
ploits, 13 data breach incidents, 12 account hijacking incidents, and
13 disclosed vulnerabilities. We chose the events related to malware,
phishing, account hijacking, and exploits from Hackmageddon [14]
that met the following conditions: (i) the number of Google search
results for an event in the period of past one month from and a
week after the event date provided by Hackmageddon is top ranked
in their corresponding threat type, and (ii) the description of an
event is so detailed as to return less ambiguous search results. Since
Hackmageddon does not cover many of data breaches, DDoS at-
tacks, and named vulnerabilities like Spectre and Drupalgeddon2,
we referred to annual security reports [6, 15, 21] to choose popular
security events in those categories. We tried to keep the number
of events similar for 9 threat types. Nonetheless, exploits were rel-
atively small compared to other threat types due to their nature.
We restricted our search domain to Twitter, Facebook, news media,
blogs, forums, and security vendor reports. We extracted the key-
words for each event from the description given in security news
or reports and searched the mentions with the keywords over 6

data source types using Google and Recorded Future [18]. For each
event, we manually reviewed whether the search results actually
corresponded to the event and then got the timeline of the mentions.

company which provides the largest data platform in cybersecurity
domain.
Findings. The followings are what we have observed from our
source investigation.
1. Twitter is largely the first source, and sometimes the only
source, to discuss cybersecurity events. Figure 1 displays the
distribution of data source types on the first day of events. It
shows that 75% of the events were discussed in Twitter on the
same day as other source types or earlier. We believe that this
is because people use Twitter as an information propagation
platform. News media, security firms, and individual security
researchers often use Twitter to quickly spread out their findings
about malware and vulnerabilities after publishing their original
articles or reports on their sites. Among the events mentioned
on Twitter on their first day, 16% were uniquely seen first in
Twitter. Figure 2 displays the distribution of data source types
by threat type on the first day of events. It shows that events in
most threat types are mentioned on Twitter once they appear.
2. Twitter is informative enough to collect further informa-
tion about cybersecurity events. We found that 82% of the
first tweets mentioned events on their first day had links for
extra information. Among those external links, 56% were news
articles, 34% were blog posts, and 7% were analysis reports like
VirusTotal.
3. Blogs and security vendor reports are also important for
early detection of cybersecurity events. Figure 1 shows that
blogs and security vendors together exclusively discussed events
more than Twitter – 18% of 105 events are first mentioned only
in blogs and security vendor reports. Also, they discussed 68%
of the events on the same day as other source types or earlier.
Figure 2 shows that blogs and security vendor reports are good
sources for sensing events related to malware, vulnerability, and
data breach. This tells that one can expect higher coverage and
lower latency in cybersecurity event detection by leveraging
information from Twitter, blogs, and security vendor reports.
4. The number of mentions is not proportional to the impor-
tance of a cybersecurity event in its early stage. Figure 3
shows the number of tweets made on the first day of events per
threat type. Although we select popular events, many events
are mentioned little on their first day. In fact, 23% of the events
mentioned on Twitter on their first day were mentioned less
than 5 times and 37% of the events were mentioned less than 10
times. This indicates that several security events take time to get
some attention from many people regardless of their importance.
5. Security events related to malware, exploit, and vulnera-
bility are mostly started by security experts, security firms,

ing, phishing, and DDoS are introduced more by other
users than security-minded users. We have examined the
authors of the tweets mentioning events for the first time. We
have categorized them into 5 groups – individual security experts
(security researchers and ethical hackers), security firms (includ-
ing their research groups), news media, vulnerability feeds, and
others. Figure 4 displays the distribution of the author groups.
We observe that 65% of the authors who made the earliest men-
tions about the events were security experts, security firms, and
news media. We also observe that 87% of events related to mal-
ware, exploit, and vulnerability were first mentioned by security
experts, security firms, and security news while 61% of events
related to account hijacking, phishing, and DDoS attack were
first mentioned by other users.
6. There is much less data available in Facebook than Twit-
ter for cybersecurity event detection. We observe from Fig-
ure 1 that 32% of the events were mentioned in Facebook on the
first day of events, but they all were covered in Twitter on the
same day. Facebook is dedicated to private communication be-
tween users, so much less data is available than Twitter although
it provides public API for data collection. This makes Facebook
less preferred than Twitter for cybersecurity event detection.
4 THE PROPOSED SYSTEM
W2E consists of four steps. The first step is the data collection from
Twitter. The second step is the data preprocessing step for extracting
the words to be monitored. In the third step, we find the words that
trigger events by detecting both new words and re-emerging words.
In the last step, we apply similarity-based clustering methods to
the tweets associated with the triggered words in order to form
events. Figure 5 illustrates the workflow of W2E.
4.1 Data Collection
For event detection, we have been collecting tweets of the selected
Twitter users using Twitter streaming API2 since 2018. While many
of the earlier works restrict data collection with keywords [29, 40,
41, 49], we restrict users. We collected Twitter accounts of famous
security experts [3, 4], well-known security news media, security
firms and their research groups, and vulnerability feeds, together
with Twitter accounts following by security experts in our organi-
zation. We then chose the users who had posted a certain number
of tweets containing a given set of threat-related keywords during
consecutive three months. After this process, 560 Twitter users
were selected – 50% security experts, 5% news media, 9% security
firms, 2% vulnerability feeds, and 34% others (e.g., IT professionals
who post security related information).
Note that there are two reasons why we restrict users in our data
collection for event detection. First, noise in event detection can
be reduced. When security-minded users mention threat-related
words like “vulnerability”, “breach”, and “hack”, there are much
less false positives. Second, it helps to make an event detection
algorithm robust to adversarial attacks. There are many fake news
created in social media like Twitter and Facebook. By restricting
the data collection with the curated users, we can avoid a detection
2https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview
of events triggered by fake news unless the users we monitor turn
to be an adversary.
4.2 Data Preprocessing
Once tweets are collected in between the previous time t −1 and the
time t of event detection, they pass through the filter with a given
set of keywords. The set of keywords is a superset that includes the
keyword sets for 5 event types of our interest – malware, exploit,
vulnerability, DDoS attack, and data breach – as subsets. Exam-
ples of keywords are “malware”, “ransomware”, “botnet”, “trojan”,
“vulnerability”, “vuln”, “bug”, “exploit”, “ddos”, and “data breach”.
Note that the larger set of keywords, the less false negatives, but
the more false positives. We then group the tweets into 5 event
types according to their corresponding keyword sets. When there
are tweets containing the keywords for more than 2 event types,
they are grouped in the order of the event types of interest. If one
is interested in endpoint device security, he/she may group the
tweets in the order of malware, exploit, vulnerability, DDoS attack,
and data breach. The remaining tweets containing keywords not
for 5 event types are collected into “others” category. We remark
that in W2E, any events related to ransomware, spyware, trojans,
botnet, rootkits, adware, keyloggers, and any other malicious files
are categorized into the malware event type. Note that, as shown
later in Section 4.3, the order of categorization of tweets does not
affect the performance of our event detection algorithm. It only
affects where the detected event is categorized. We also note that
we monitor the CVE-related events separately by collecting tweets
containing CVE IDs.
The categorization of tweets helps to split multiple events as-
sociated with a word by event type. For example, when the word
“linux” is detected as a re-emerging word, multiple events like new
Linux vulnerability findings and new Linux malware appearance
may occur on the same day. In our implementation, we collect very
general keywords like “attack”, “hack”, and “leak” into the keyword
set for “others” category so that we do not miss any important
security events.
After filtering and categorization, tweets are preprocessed to
construct a set of words to be monitored in the following step:
(1) Named entity recognition (NER) is applied to each tweet.
Then, we construct the list of person names to remove them
later.
(2) A part of speech (POS) tagging is applied to each tweet.
Threat words of our interest are malware names, vulnera-
bilities, companies, and products. These words are mostly
nouns, so we tag words in each tweet with parts of speech
to extract nouns later.
(3) In each tweet, symbols, emails, URLs, and Twitter handles are
removed. The tweets are lowercased. Stopwords are removed.
Note that stopwords (e.g., the, a, of, or, to, etc.) are the most
common words that appear in the most of the texts. Since
many Twitter users overuse their Twitter handles for self-
advertisement, Twitter handles make a lot of noises in the
word monitoring.
(4) Technology/product terms and their alias are replaced by
single representative terms in the form of a single token. For
example, “wi-fi” is replaced by “wifi”, and “smart tv” and
Session 13: Malware ASIA CCS ’20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan669Figure 5: The workflow of our cybersecurity event detection system.
“smart-tv” are replaced by “smarttv”. We refer to DBpedia
for synonyms.
(5) The tweets are tokenized and only noun words are extracted
to form candidate words to be monitored. We keep CVE
IDs [9] as well. Then, the words in the list of person names
are removed from the candidate words. We also remove the
words of single characters. Note that we empirically observe
that person names in most tweets are not of our interest
although some person names are threat actors.
(6) Lemmatization is applied to each word in order to represent
the inflected forms of a word as a single word.
