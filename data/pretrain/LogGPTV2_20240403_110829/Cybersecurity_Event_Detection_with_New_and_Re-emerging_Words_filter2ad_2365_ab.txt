### Event Detection Algorithm from Twitter through Dynamic Query Expansion

An event detection algorithm has been developed for Twitter using dynamic query expansion. This method constructs events by aggregating tweets based on the similarity of dependency graphs between a tweet and an initial query. The process iteratively expands the initial query set by incorporating tweets with high similarity, thereby refining the queries and specifying events. Despite its innovative approach, this method has several limitations in quickly identifying events. Both methods require a large volume of tweets to detect an event, which means they may fail to detect events early if it takes time for the event to be sufficiently mentioned. Additionally, if critical security events are not frequently mentioned over several days, these methods may not detect them. While both methods can be applied to capture events with fewer mentions, this often results in a high rate of false positives.

According to PetroviÄ‡ et al. [38], first story detection generates a vast number of new stories daily, most of which are of little interest. Therefore, their focus is on detecting significant events that are widely discussed. Khadpur et al. [19] reduce the false positive rate compared to Le Sceller et al. [29] by iteratively specifying events through query expansion. However, for events with only a few mentions, the queries are likely to be expanded less than twice, leading to a high false positive rate.

### Other Event Detection Methods

Several other event detection methods do not require a large volume of tweets. Ritter et al. [40] proposed a seed-based weakly supervised method for extracting cybersecurity events from Twitter. However, this method suffers from many false negatives due to its strong reliance on named entity recognition (NER). The accuracy of NER for entities of interest, such as products and companies, is still low. For example, recent applications [49] showed that only 377,468 tweets remained out of 976,180 containing the keyword "vulnerability" after removing tweets without named entities. This leads to many relevant tweets being excluded from event candidates.

Mittal et al. [34] introduced an ontology-based alert generation system for cybersecurity threats on Twitter. They constructed a knowledge base system using existing cybersecurity ontologies like the Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) [46] and DBpedia [23]. Although this approach allows for collecting additional information about triggered events and making predictive inferences, its performance is highly dependent on the coverage of the knowledge base, limiting its practical use.

Sapienza et al. [44] recently proposed a simple event detection method based on new words for early event detection. However, this method can only detect events containing new terms, which may result in missing important events that are not described by new terms. For instance, there may be no new terms to express vulnerabilities like Spectre, Dirty Cow, and Heartbleed.

### Twitter as a Data Source

Various data feeds contain threat-related information. Ideally, monitoring all data feeds would be optimal for early event detection. However, no generic event detection algorithm works for all data feeds. To determine the best data source, we evaluated different sources for early security event detection. We analyzed the timelines of mentions for a sample of 105 cybersecurity events that occurred in 2018 across various data sources, including mainstream news and developer forums.

**Setup:**
- **Event Selection:** 105 security events were selected, consisting of 12 ransomware attacks, 13 botnet attacks, 13 other malware attacks, 12 DDoS attacks, 11 phishing attacks, 6 exploits, 13 data breach incidents, 12 account hijacking incidents, and 13 disclosed vulnerabilities.
- **Criteria:** Events related to malware, phishing, account hijacking, and exploits were chosen from Hackmageddon [14] based on the number of Google search results and detailed descriptions. Additional popular events were selected from annual security reports [6, 15, 21].
- **Data Sources:** We restricted our search to Twitter, Facebook, news media, blogs, forums, and security vendor reports. Keywords for each event were extracted from security news or reports and used to search for mentions across these sources.

**Findings:**
1. **Twitter as the First Source:** Twitter is often the first and sometimes the only source to discuss cybersecurity events. Figure 1 shows that 75% of the events were discussed on Twitter on the same day or earlier than other sources. This is because Twitter is used as an information propagation platform by news media, security firms, and individual researchers.
2. **Informative Links:** 82% of the first tweets on the first day of events included links to extra information, such as news articles (56%), blog posts (34%), and analysis reports (7%).
3. **Blogs and Security Vendor Reports:** These sources are also crucial for early detection. Together, they exclusively discussed 18% of the events, and 68% of the events were discussed on the same day or earlier than other sources. They are particularly useful for sensing events related to malware, vulnerabilities, and data breaches.
4. **Number of Mentions:** The number of mentions is not proportional to the importance of an event. Many events received few mentions on their first day, indicating that some security events take time to gain attention.
5. **Authorship of Tweets:** Security experts, security firms, and news media are the primary authors of tweets about malware, exploits, and vulnerabilities. In contrast, other users are more likely to introduce events related to account hijacking, phishing, and DDoS attacks.
6. **Facebook Data Availability:** Facebook has less available data for cybersecurity event detection compared to Twitter. While 32% of the events were mentioned on Facebook on the first day, all were also covered on Twitter. Facebook's focus on private communication makes it less suitable for this purpose.

### The Proposed System: W2E

W2E is a four-step system for cybersecurity event detection:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Collection Method:** We collect tweets from selected Twitter users using the Twitter streaming API since 2018. Users include security experts, news media, security firms, and vulnerability feeds.
   - **User Selection:** 560 Twitter users were selected based on their activity and relevance to security topics. Restricting users reduces noise and makes the system robust to adversarial attacks.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Filtering and Categorization:** Collected tweets are filtered using a set of keywords and categorized into 5 event types: malware, exploit, vulnerability, DDoS attack, and data breach. Remaining tweets are categorized as "others."
   - **Preprocessing Steps:**
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to remove person names.
     - Part of Speech (POS) tagging to extract nouns.
     - Removal of symbols, emails, URLs, and Twitter handles.
     - Replacement of technology/product terms with single representative terms.
     - Tokenization and extraction of noun words.
     - Lemmatization to represent inflected forms as a single word.

3. **Word Monitoring:**
   - **Trigger Words:** We detect both new and re-emerging words that trigger events.
   - **Clustering:** Similarity-based clustering methods are applied to tweets associated with triggered words to form events.

4. **Event Formation:**
   - **Clustering:** Clustering methods group tweets to form coherent events based on the detected trigger words.

This workflow ensures that W2E can effectively detect and categorize cybersecurity events from Twitter data.
