We are building a Numpy python wheel from source, and binding it to a version
of MKL that is installed on our cluster. Since Numpy 1.19, a single test fails
when running `numpy.test()` :
    >           assert info.get_lib_dirs() == lib_dirs
    E           AssertionError: assert ['/cvmfs/soft.../lib/intel64'] == ['/tmp/tmpwmv.../tmprf9ssim6']
    E             At index 0 diff: '/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2017/Core/imkl/2019.2.187/mkl/lib/intel64' != '/tmp/tmpwmvc9p10'
    E             Right contains one more item: '/tmp/tmprf9ssim6'
    E             Full diff:
    E             - ['/tmp/tmpwmvc9p10', '/tmp/tmprf9ssim6']
    E             + ['/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2017/Core/imkl/2019.2.187/mkl/lib/intel64']
Now, obviously, the path returned by `info.get_lib_dirs()` is the correct one,
it should not find libraries in `/tmp/...`.
Why is this test failing ?
Note that 10895 other tests pass correctly.
