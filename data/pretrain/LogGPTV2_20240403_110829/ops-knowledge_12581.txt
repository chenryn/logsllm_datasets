User: I have a server in twisted, implementing a LineReceiver protocol.
When I call sendLine in response to a client message, it writes the line to the client immediately, as one would expect.
But say the client asks the server to do a lengthy calculation. I want the server to periodically send a progress message to the client. When the server takes initiative and calls sendLine without the client having asked for anything, it seems to wait for the client to send a message to the server before sending anything.
How do I send a message from the server to the client immediately, without having the client explicitly ask for it?
Assistant: If by "immediately" you mean "when the client connects", try calling sendLine in your LineReceiver subclass's connectionMade.
