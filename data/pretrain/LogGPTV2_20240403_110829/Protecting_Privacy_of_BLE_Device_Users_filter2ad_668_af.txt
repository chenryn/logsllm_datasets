form jamming frequently. Fig. 12b shows the average
energy overhead when BLE-Guardian is protecting the
set of ten devices (we described earlier) at different ad-
vertising intervals. In the worst case of 10 target BLE
devices, including a couple advertising at the highest fre-
quency possible, the energy overhead is limited to 16%
regardless of whether there are other advertisers in the
area. In other cases, when there are less target devices
and/or target devices are advertising at a lower frequency,
the energy overhead is negligible.
7 Conclusion
BLE is emerging as the most prominent and promis-
ing communication protocol between different IoT de-
vices. It, however, accompanies a set of privacy risks.
An adversary can track, proﬁle, and even harm the user
through BLE-equipped devices that constantly adver-
tise their presence. Existing solutions are impractical
as they require modiﬁcations to the BLE-equipped de-
vices, thereby making their deployment difﬁcult.
In
this paper, we presented a device-agnostic system, called
BLE-Guardian, which addresses the users’ privacy risks
brought by BLE-equipped devices.
BLE-Guardian
doesn’t require any modiﬁcation to the protocol and can
be implemented with off-the-shelf Bluetooth hardware.
We implemented BLE-Guardian using Ubertooth One
radio and Android, and evaluated its effectiveness in pro-
tecting the users’ privacy. In future, we plan to explore
the data plane by analyzing and reducing the data leaks
from BLE devices to unauthorized clients.

A Analysis of Device Hiding
BLE-Guardian may jam the advertisements of non-
target devices which might disrupt their operation, which
we refer to as the second situation in Section 5.3.2. Nev-
ertheless, because of the random delay introduced by the
device before each advertisement, the aforementioned
“collision” events become unlikely. In what follows, we
show that the expected number of another device’s ad-
vertisements within the expected advertising interval of
the target BLE-equipped device will always be less than
1, when BLE-Guardian protects a single BLE-equipped
device.

One could view the advertising process of a sin-
gle BLE-equipped device as a renewal process [5],
where each event corresponds to an advertising session.
The inter-arrival times, Xi, are nothing but the inter-
advertising intervals deﬁned as i.i.d. random variables
such that Xi ∼ uni f (adv,adv + 10). The nth advertise-
ment time Tn = ∑n
i=1 Xi has the distribution deﬁned by
the n-fold convolution of distribution of Xi. As n in-
creases, the probability distribution of the n-th adver-
tisement spreads over a larger time interval deﬁned as
A = [n.adv, n.(adv + 10)].
The device hiding module attempts jamming at an in-
terval of width 10ms, as speciﬁed before.
If this jam-
ming interval falls within the expected advertising in-
terval of some other device, A, then the second situa-
tion of Section 5.3.2 might occur. Nevertheless, as n in-
creases the length of interval A increases and thus the
expected number of advertisements, from a single de-
vice within 10ms should be less than 1. We show be-
low how the expected number of advertisements in a
10ms interval drops between n = 1 and n = 2. We con-
sider m(t), the expected number of events up to time
0 m(t − x) fX (x)dx, where fS(s)
is the probability distribution of Xi which is equal to
uni f (adv,adv + 10) and FX (t) is the cumulative distri-
bution function given as:
t, deﬁned as FX (t) +(cid:31) t

FX (t) =
During the ﬁrst advertising interval, t ∈ [adv,adv +
10 +
10], the expected number of advertisements is t−adv
(cid:31) t
adv m(t − x)dx after substituting FX (t) and fX (x) with
their corresponding expressions. After performing a sub-
stitution of variable of y = t − x, and since m(t) =0 for
t < adv, then m(t) = t−adv
10 . So, if the expected advertis-
ing interval of the device hiding module overlaps with the
ﬁrst advertising interval of another advertising device,
the expected number of events, m(adv + 10)− m(adv),
will be 1, which is intuitive.
The second advertisement will take place at the in-
terval B = [2.adv, 2.(adv + 10)], and we use a simi-
lar procedure to derive the expressions for m(t) for t ∈
[2.adv, 2.adv + 10] and t ∈ [2.adv, 2.(adv + 10)]. If the
expected advertising interval of the device hiding mod-
ule overlaps with interval, B, then the expected number
of advertisements m(t + 10)− m(t) will drop to 1
2. The
same trend will follow for the subsequent advertising in-
tervals; the expected number of another device’s adver-
tisements within the expected advertising of the target
BLE device will always be less than 1. Our evaluation in
Section 6. conﬁrms this observation.
Finally, even if another device, with the same adver-
tising parameters, starts advertising with the target BLE
device at the same time, their advertising events will
eventually diverge. After N advertisements from both
devices, the distribution of TaN+1 − T bN+1, the differ-
ence in time between the N + 1 advertising instants of
both devices will be a random variable with mean 0 but
with σ = 2.N. 5√3. As N increases, the standard devi-
ation increases, which in turn decreases the probability
of both advertising events taking place within 10ms. The
10ms-advertising interval is the length of interval that the
device hiding module expects the target BLE device to
advertise.
