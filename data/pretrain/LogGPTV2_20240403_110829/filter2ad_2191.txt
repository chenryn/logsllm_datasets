ABSTRACT
A typical but trivial layout of alphanumeric buttons in the touch-
screen setting is to arrange the 10 digits and 26 letters in a natural
order. This arrangement does not take into account the frequen-
cies of letters and digits when the users touch the buttons to key
in their passwords or messages. We examine large scale datasets
of over 141 million passwords collected from several leading web-
sites for social networking, Internet forums, gaming, dating, and
various other online service providers in China, and ﬁnd that the
distribution of letters in passwords is quite close to that in Chinese
language. Based on the letter/digit frequencies, we further propose
an alphanumeric button layout scheme with the following advan-
tages: the buttons are clicked as uniformly as possible, so that the
lifetime of the touchscreen can be prolonged and ﬁnger oil residues
may scatter more evenly over the button area of the screen; and
in the meantime, the movements of users’ ﬁngers are improved to
enhance good user experience when inputting messages. The idea
behind the layout is potentially applicable to diversiﬁed races.

INTRODUCTION
Today’s personal computing devices (say smartphones, tablet com-
puters, etc.) typically use touchscreen inputs as the main way of
application-deﬁned interaction. A touchscreen is an electronic vi-
sual display that the users can interact directly (e.g., by keying in
their passwords, messages) with what is displayed, rather than us-
ing a mouse, a keyboard, or any other intermediate device.

A typical but trivial layout of alphanumeric buttons in the touch-
screen setting is to arrange the 10 digits and the 26 letters in a natu-
ral order, as showed in the ﬁgure 1. This arrangement does not take
into account the frequencies of letters and digits of people’s daily-
use passwords or messages. Some disadvantages and side eﬀects
may arise. First, similar to the traditional key buttons (as showed
in ﬁgure 2) [10], some area of the touchscreen may turn out to be
thick point of touch and whole area of all buttons are far from be-
ing uniformly clicked. Second, during the use of touchscreens, oily
residues, or smudges, may remain on the screen (see ﬁgure 3) [8],
which constitutes a side-channel for frequency-based attacks [2].
Finally, the movements of users’s ﬁngers can be further improved
when keying in messages as two letters, especially with high fre-
quencies, may not be next to each other in this trivial layout.
Passwords are currently the most frequently used method for
user authentication. Researchers have spent considerable eﬀort study-
ing the usage and characteristics of passwords [10]. During the past
few years many security breaches in major websites in China led to
the disclosure of passwords of millions of users [7, 4]. These leaks
are either conﬁrmed by the owners themselves or reported by the
victim users [4]. These leaked password lists provide the largest
samples of real-world passwords to date, oﬀering an enormous op-
portunity for empirically grounded research.
We extract 141,854,840 textual passwords from these data sources.
In this paper, we study these passwords and ﬁnd that the distribu-
tion of letters in passwords is quite close to that in Chinese lan-
guage. We further explore an alphanumeric button layout based on
the digit/letter frequencies. The advantages of the layout are be-
low: the buttons are clicked as uniformly as possible, so that the
lifetime of the touchscreen can be prolonged and oil residues of
keying may scatter more evenly over the alphanumeric button area
of the screen; and in the meanwhile, the movements of users’ ﬁn-
gers are improved to enhance good user experience when inputting
messages. While the layout is quite useful for Chinese netizens (up
to 0.618 billion as of 2013), the idea behind the layout is potentially
applicable to other races.
2. ALPHANUMERIC BUTTON LAYOUT
We study realistic textual passwords that were leaked from de-
ployed authentication systems. We have 141,854,840 passwords in
total. The proposed layout is based on the analysis of 10 digits and
26 letters.
2.1 Data sets
The sites from which our data were taken include many popular
online service providers in China. This means that our study fo-
1457Figure 1: trivial layout

cuses on passwords from users of diversiﬁed backgrounds. We list
a few examples as below.
• Tianya
As a popular Internet forum in China, Tianya Club is the
33rd most visited site in China and 241st overall by Alexa as
of May 2014 [12].
• CSDN
Another data source is the Chinese Software Developer Net-
work (CSDN, www.csdn.net), which is one of the biggest
networks of software developers in China and provides Web
forums, blog hosting, IT news, and other services. CSDN has
about 10 million registered users and is the largest developer
community in China [9].
• Gaming and Dating
The other data sources include gaming, dating service providers
such as 7k7k [1], 17173 [6], zhenai [13], etc.
2.2 Experiments
We ﬁrst check the letter frequencies of the passwords. Figure
4 shows the result and the letter frequencies of Chinese language
due to [3] where the authors analyzed three types of papers: poli-
tics, technology, and literature. Similar analysis can be found in [5].
We see that many passwords represent the characteristics of Pinyin,
which is the Chinese oﬃcial phonetic system for transcribing the
Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into the Latin al-
phabet. That is, Chinese users tend to use Pinyin digraphs or tri-
graphs in their passwords [11]. Therefore, the analysis of password
is of great signiﬁcance.
Next we experiment the number of two letters and three letters.
Top 10 most common digraphs and top 10 most common trigraphs
are showed in table 1.
We also check the frequencies of the 10 digits that appear in the
passwords. Figure 5 shows the result. It is clear that among them,
Figure 5: digit frequency
0, 1, and 2 are the most frequent ones, and 4 and 7 are the least
used.
2.3 Alphanumeric button layout
Now we are ready to make alphanumeric button layout. Accord-
ing to the letter frequencies (ﬁgure 4), we can classify the 26 letters
into three groups (each in order of frequency): high frequency–a,
i, n, e, o, h, l, g; medium frequency–s, u, y, w, c, d, z, x; low
frequency–m, q, j, t, r, b, f, k, p, v. We have three steps for the
proposed layout.
Step 1: Arrange high frequency letters
Note that the letters with high frequencies match those that appear
in the most common digraphs in the table 1. As 0 and 1 buttons are
reserved generally for special services, we assign these eight letters
to the buttons from 2 to 9 so that these letters of high frequencies are
not on the same button. We also require in our layout that the two
letters of any most commonly used digraph in table 1 should be next
to each other in the horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal
directions, so that the movements of users’ ﬁngers are improved to
enhance good user experience when inputting messages. Then we
get the layout as exampled in ﬁgure 6. We remark that the layout
satisfying our requirements may be non-unique.
Step 2: Arrange medium frequency letters
Next we add the letters with medium frequency onto the buttons. To

balance the click aﬀect, we take a reverse order (table 2). Further,
we switch the positions of x and d, so that ax does not occur on the
same button (because xia is one of the most common trigraphs in
table 1) and the layout is illustrated in ﬁgure 7.

Step 3: Arrange low frequency letters
At last, we append sequentially the rest of the letters onto the but-
tons since their frequencies are quite low. As the frequencies of 4
and 7 are the lowest among the 10 digits according to ﬁgure 5, we
assign two letters with low frequency to each of them. This results
in the layout as showed in ﬁgure 8.
It is clear that in our layout, any of the most common digraphs in
table 1 do not appear on any single button and neither do any two
letters of any (most frequent used) trigraphs from the same table.
