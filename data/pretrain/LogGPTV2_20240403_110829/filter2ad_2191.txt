## Abstract
A typical but trivial layout for alphanumeric buttons on touchscreens arranges the 10 digits and 26 letters in a natural order. This arrangement does not consider the frequencies of letters and digits when users input their passwords or messages. We analyze over 141 million passwords from leading Chinese websites for social networking, Internet forums, gaming, dating, and other online services. Our findings indicate that the distribution of letters in passwords closely mirrors that of the Chinese language. Based on these letter and digit frequencies, we propose an alphanumeric button layout scheme with the following advantages: 
- Uniform clicking to prolong touchscreen lifespan and distribute finger oil residues evenly.
- Improved finger movement for better user experience during message input.
- Potentially applicable to diverse user groups.

## 1. Introduction
Modern personal computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets, primarily use touchscreens for application-defined interactions. A touchscreen is an electronic visual display that allows users to interact directly with what is displayed, eliminating the need for a mouse, keyboard, or other intermediate devices.

A common but simplistic layout for alphanumeric buttons on touchscreens arranges the 10 digits and 26 letters in a natural order, as shown in Figure 1. This arrangement does not account for the frequencies of letters and digits in daily-use passwords or messages, leading to several disadvantages:
- Uneven wear and tear on the touchscreen, similar to traditional keypads (Figure 2).
- Oily residues or smudges on the screen, which can be exploited for frequency-based attacks (Figure 3).
- Inefficient finger movements, especially for high-frequency letter combinations.

Passwords are the most frequently used method for user authentication. Recent security breaches in major Chinese websites have led to the disclosure of millions of user passwords, providing a large dataset for empirical research. We extracted 141,854,840 textual passwords from these sources and found that the distribution of letters in passwords closely matches that of the Chinese language. We then propose an alphanumeric button layout based on these frequencies, aiming to enhance the user experience and touchscreen longevity.

### 2.1 Data Sets
Our data were sourced from popular online service providers in China, including:
- **Tianya Club**: A widely visited internet forum in China, ranked 33rd by Alexa as of May 2014.
- **CSDN (Chinese Software Developer Network)**: One of the largest developer communities in China, with about 10 million registered users.
- **Gaming and Dating Sites**: Providers such as 7k7k, 17173, and Zhenai.

### 2.2 Experiments
We analyzed the letter frequencies in the passwords and compared them to the frequencies in the Chinese language (Figure 4). Many passwords exhibit characteristics of Pinyin, the official phonetic system for transcribing Mandarin into the Latin alphabet. We also examined the frequencies of two-letter and three-letter combinations (Table 1) and the 10 digits (Figure 5).

### 2.3 Alphanumeric Button Layout
Based on the letter frequencies, we classified the 26 letters into three groups: high, medium, and low frequency. We then arranged the letters in three steps:

#### Step 1: Arrange High-Frequency Letters
High-frequency letters (a, i, n, e, o, h, l, g) were assigned to buttons 2 to 9, ensuring that the most common digraphs (Table 1) are adjacent horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or anti-diagonally (Figure 6).

#### Step 2: Arrange Medium-Frequency Letters
Medium-frequency letters (s, u, y, w, c, d, z, x) were added, balancing the click effect by reversing the order and adjusting positions (Figure 7).

#### Step 3: Arrange Low-Frequency Letters
Low-frequency letters (m, q, j, t, r, b, f, k, p, v) were sequentially appended, with two letters assigned to buttons 4 and 7 due to their low digit frequencies (Figure 8).

In our layout, no common digraph or trigraph appears on a single button, enhancing user experience and touchscreen durability.
