### 1. Phishing

#### What is Phishing?
Phishing attacks employ a combination of social engineering and technical deception to steal personal identity data and financial account credentials from consumers. This includes credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers.

#### Example of a Phishing Email
- **From:** XX Bank
- **Subject:** Important Notification
- **Content:**
  - "Dear Customer, please click on the link below to update your account information."
  - **Link:** [Fake URL]
- **Visuals:**
  - Fake email and website that mimic the legitimate bank's homepage.
  - Examples of phishing sites:
    - **Sample #1:** Steals money or credit card information.
    - **Sample #2:** Steals online banking account details.
    - **Sample #3-5:** Steals service/identity information.

#### Increasing Trend of Phishing Sites
- The number of phishing sites has been increasing over time.

#### Tricks Used in Phishing
1. **Similar-looking URLs to Genuine URLs:**
   - Example: 
     - Original: `http://www.barclays.co.uk/`
     - Phishing: `http://www.barclayze.co.uk` or `http://www.barclays.validation.co.uk`
   - Sub-domain trick: `http://www.barclays.validation.co.uk` where the actual domain is `validation.co.uk`, which is not related to Barclays Bank.

2. **Using IP Addresses:**
   - Phishers may use IP addresses instead of domain names to make the URL look less suspicious.

3. **Pop-Up Windows:**
   - A real webpage opens in the background, while a bare pop-up window (without an address bar, toolbars, status bar, and scrollbars) displays the fake webpage in the foreground.

4. **URL Spoofing of Address Bar:**
   - Scripts can hide the address bar, making it difficult for users to verify the URL.
   - Example script:
     ```javascript
     var vuln_x, vuln_y, vuln_w, vuln_h;
     function vuln_calc() {
         var root = document[(document.compatMode == 'CSS1Compat') ? 'documentElement' : 'body'];
         vuln_x = window.screenLeft + 70;
         vuln_y = window.screenTop - 45; // Adjust window position
         vuln_w = root.offsetWidth - 200;
         vuln_h = 17; // URL window height
         vuln_show();
     }
     var vuln_win;
     function vuln_pop() {
         vuln_win = window.createPopup();
         vuln_win.document.body.innerHTML = vuln_html;
         vuln_win.document.body.style.margin = 0;
         vuln_win.document.body.onunload = vuln_pop;
         vuln_show();
     }
     function vuln_show() {
         if (vuln_win)
             vuln_win.show(vuln_x, vuln_y, vuln_w, vuln_h);
     }
     var vuln_html = 'https://internetbanking.suntrust.com/default.asp';
     if (window.createPopup) {
         vuln_calc();
         vuln_pop();
         window.setInterval(vuln_calc, 25);
     } else {
     }
     ```

5. **Installing Trojans or Spyware:**
   - **Client-side Attack:**
     - Malicious site (e.g., IE iFrame vulnerability MS04-040, MS05-036/37).
     - Users download and execute malicious files after visiting the site.
   - **Example of a Malicious Site:**

6. **Tricks to Keep Phishing Pages Stealthy:**
   - Using ‘dot’ to hide directories unless you use `-a, --all` to show all entries.

7. **Data Transmission:**
   - Data is sent to the phisher via a `send.php` script.

8. **Money Laundering Process:**
   - **Step 1:** The phisher obtains account information through phishing.
   - **Step 2:** Recruit job seekers by sending spam emails.
   - **Step 3:** Transfer money from the victim's account to the job applicant's account.
   - **Step 4:** The job applicant withdraws the money and wires it to a foreign account.
   - **Step 5:** The phisher receives the final payment.

9. **Beyond Phishing:**
   - Phishers use two methods to speed up the installation of phishing sites:
     1. **Using Phishing Packages:**
     2. **Redirection Services:**
        - Redirect web traffic to existing phishing websites.
   - Victims' hosts are used to send spam emails advertising phishing websites.
   - Propagation of spam and phishing messages via botnets.

10. **Redirection (Redir):**
    - **Benefits:**
      1. Easy to configure compromised hosts.
      2. Increases the speed of compromising vulnerable systems.
      3. If a compromised host is detected, the main phishing site remains active.
      4. If the main site is detected, one of the compromised hosts can be set as the new main site.

11. **Active Phishing Attacks:**
    - **Cross-site Scripting Redirection:**
      - Insert redirect scripts on forums or guestbooks.
      - Script code can redirect users to a fake authentication page and steal their account information.
    - **SQL Injection:**
      - Malicious script insertion to exploit web application vulnerabilities.

12. **Auction Scams – Interception:**
    - **Process:**
      1. Send a fake mail to the buyer before the real seller.
      2. Send a fake mail to the seller.
    - **Typical Use:**
      - Mails overflow to reveal the fake mail, focusing on dedicated victims.

### 2. Botnets

#### What is a Botnet?
- **Control Mechanism:**
  - IRC constructs a signal channel that allows hackers to control victims without being detected.

#### Botnet Formation
1. **Hacker Writes the Bot:**
   - Installs the bot backdoor in compromised hosts.
   - **Bot Controller (IRC Server):**
     - Host with high bandwidth is chosen to be the controller.
   - **Bot:**
     - Installed in the compromised hosts.
   - **Current Trends:**
     - Botnets are a new control mechanism after hacking compromised hosts.
   - **Inside Bot Source Code:**

2. **Botnet Operations:**
   - **Giving Orders in IRC Channel:**
   - **Automatic Spreading:**

#### Threats of Botnets
- **DDoS Extortion:**
- **Installing Malwares and Spywares:**
