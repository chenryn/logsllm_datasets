to optical TEMPEST attacks.
intensity of a device’s power indicator LED may provide an accu-
rate approximation at high resolution (at GHz) regarding the power
consumed by the device [48], the primary disadvantage comes from
the sensors’ side: the frequency bandwidth of the electro-optical
sensors we used in this research are limited to a few MHz. As a
result, only attacks that are based on power analysis and can be
applied with a sampling rate lower than a few MHz may be practical
against the devices. However, it has already been shown that many
attacks can be applied with a very low sampling rate, e.g., RSA
keys were recovered from acoustic signals that were sampled at
low sampling rates (at few KHz). Such attacks could also be applied
with optical signals obtained from a device’s power indicator LED
The Glowworm attack suffers from one main disadvantage: The
quality of the sound recovered is proportional to the quality of
the equipment used by the eavesdropper. In our study, the cost
of our equipment came to $1000 ($250 - telescope, $250 - electro-
optical sensor, and $500 - ADC), an investment which allowed
us to recover speech from a distance of 35 meters. In order to
increase the attack range and recover higher quality sound, more
expensive professional equipment is required (e.g., a more sensitive
ADC and electro-optical sensor, a professional telescope). Such
equipment would enable eavesdroppers to recover sound from
vulnerable devices that have very weak LED intensity (e.g., Google
Nest Mini, Creative Pebble speakers). In addition, some electrical
circuits are not vulnerable to the Glowworm attack because they
contain voltage stabilizers and filters that distort/change the known
linear response of the intensity of the LED to power consumption.
Interestingly, we found that while the power indicator LED of
Logitech S120 speakers leaks information regarding the sound that
is played from them, other speakers sold by the same manufacturer,
Logitech Z200 speakers, do not leak such information, as can be
seen in Fig. 16.
For future work, we suggest investigating the possibility of: (1)
improving the Glowworm attack without the use of expensive
equipment (e.g., improving the recovery model by using advanced
models such as artificial bandwidth extension [37, 38, 45, 55, 56])
and (2) recovering non-acoustic information from devices (e.g, op-
tical cryptanalysis via a device’s power indicator LED).
