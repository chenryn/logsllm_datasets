User: I am porting a Python investing application to Google App Engine. Every market that you can trade in is a plugin: for example the stocks trading and FOREX trading are all plugins.
The application stores the portfolio (which is a Portfolio class instance containing the active investments (class instances) and history) as a pickle. However you can't write to the disk, and it seems a bit crude to use pickles in the Datastore as a blob, and pickles are also slow and CPU intensive (no cPickle).
Does anyone have any ideas how I can store all the current investments, and the history to the datastore without using large and intensive pickles?
Thank you
Ps. webapp or Django?
Assistant: The best solution would be to use the Datastore data models, but you'll have to rewrite parts of your app. Using Pickle for data persistance, especially involving much data, is not a good pratice.
