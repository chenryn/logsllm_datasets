# Environment
    Windows build number:  [Versione 10.0.18362.356]
    PowerToys version:  0.11.0
    PowerToy module: FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
The Windows bottom bar appear at fullscreen in one of the zone I set
(screenshot attached) .  
It happens as long as I use on ore more Virtual Desktop `WIN` \+ `CTRL` \+ `D`
  1. Open PowerToys
  2. FancyZones
  3. Edit layout
  4. Change/Create new virtual desktop with `WIN` \+ `TAB` or just `WIN` \+ `CTRL` \+ `L/R ARROW`
  5. **(the actual Issue)** The Win Bar appears full-height (as in image)
  6. To exit from that view I have to click it or click in search then ESC
  7. Sometimes the layout I created is not usable anymore, sometimes is (I dind't figure out why, but I will update this issue asap)
# Expected behavior
  * To be able to set (potentially) a different layout for every Virtual Desktop
  * Windows bar shouldn't appear as long as I switch from a desktop to another
# Actual behavior
  * The Windows bar take all vertical space in the zone I choosed
