The provided log chunk documents a series of events in a Hadoop MapReduce job, including failures, address changes, and task transitions. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log:

1. **Failure on Node**:
   - At 18:06:26, an `INFO` level log from `Thread-50` indicates that there was a failure on the node `MININT-FNANLI5.fareast.corp.microsoft.com`.

2. **Failed Map Attempt**:
   - The same thread (`Thread-50`) at 18:06:26 logs that the map attempt `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_1` has been added to the list of failed maps.

3. **Address Change Warnings**:
   - At 18:06:27, a `WARN` level log from `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000` indicates an address change for the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - Another `WARN` log at the same time from `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer` reports a failure to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for 89 seconds, with a retry scheduled.
   - A similar `WARN` log at 18:06:27 from `RMCommunicator Allocator` reports an address change for the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.

4. **Task Scheduling Information**:
   - At 18:06:27, an `INFO` log from `RMCommunicator Allocator` provides details about the current state of task scheduling, including pending, scheduled, and assigned tasks, as well as container allocations and releases.

5. **Retry and Error in Contacting RM**:
   - At 18:06:28, a `WARN` log from `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000` again reports an address change for the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - Another `WARN` log at the same time from `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer` reports a failure to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` for 90 seconds, with a retry scheduled.
   - An `INFO` log from `RMCommunicator Allocator` at 18:06:28 indicates a retry to connect to the server `msra-sa-41:8030` using a retry policy.
   - An `ERROR` log from `RMCommunicator Allocator` at 18:06:28 reports an error in contacting the Resource Manager (RM).

6. **Task Progress and Fatal Error**:
   - At 18:06:28, several `INFO` logs from `IPC Server handler` report the progress of the task attempt `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` at 0.37551183.
   - A `FATAL` log from `IPC Server handler 4` at 18:06:28 reports a `java.net.NoRouteToHostException` indicating no route to host `msra-sa-41:9000` from `MININT-FNANLI5/127.0.0.1`.

7. **Diagnostics and Task Transitions**:
   - Multiple `INFO` logs at 18:06:28 provide diagnostics for the task attempt, detailing the `NoRouteToHostException`.
   - An `INFO` log from `AsyncDispatcher event handler` at 18:06:28 indicates that the task attempt `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` transitioned from `RUNNING` to `FAIL_CONTAINER_CLEANUP`.
   - Subsequent `INFO` logs from `ContainerLauncher #2` at 18:06:28 detail the processing of the `CONTAINER_REMOTE_CLEANUP` event and the killing of the task attempt.
   - Finally, an `INFO` log from `AsyncDispatcher event handler` at 18:06:28 indicates that the task attempt transitioned from `FAIL_CONTAINER_CLEANUP` to `FAIL_TASK_CLEANUP`.

In summary, the log chunk captures a sequence of events involving a failed task attempt, address changes, lease renewal failures, and a critical network issue leading to the termination of the task.
