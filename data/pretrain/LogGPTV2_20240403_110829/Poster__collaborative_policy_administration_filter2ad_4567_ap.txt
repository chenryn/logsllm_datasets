DESIS thematic cluster project, we did not make time 
to set specific goals with stakeholders – beyond the 
aims of the Green Camden initiative described above.  
Nor did we establish what success would look like for 
the projects we were engaged in from the different 
perspectives of all the actors involved.  This lack of 
clearly articulated project goals (beyond that of the 
students who had to meet course requirements in 
the given time) led to a feeling of deflation once the 
projects ‘finished’.  It meant that the projects necessarily 
became more about the students learning than the 
community’s goals as the students had to complete tasks 
within a specific timeframe to achieve their required 
course outcomes.  This was disappointing in terms of 
community expectations.  Our usual way of delivering 
collaborative design projects with non-design actors is 
via fostering ongoing partnerships/relationships with 
actors and establishing means for (open) evaluation 
and feedback on project progress and outcomes.  We 
feel such an approach, where there is more familiarity 
between collaborating partners, would have enabled 
communities to direct student research more easily than 
this project allowed.  We found that where the students 
engaged with communities in meaningful ways the 
most promising projects developed i.e. they delivered 
the best results - though the lack of evaluative feedback 
so far means we can’t be sure on this, as no agreed 
measurement protocols were set up.
(iv) Expertise.  It is important to clarify precisely what 
necessary community ‘expertise’ means in the context 
of a collaborative design project.  Also, to understand 
whether the necessary ‘expertise’ is available within the 
communities that are being collaborated with.  Whilst 
community members are often ‘experts’ of their own 
experience and this experience is essential to appropriate 
collaborative design outcomes, our experience (with 
DACRC) is that specialist expertise/research is often 
needed to progress projects at the scoping stage (i.e. 
specialist crime knowledge is viewed more effectively 
at the beginning) and that this is not always located 
in community groups, but in Lissenden garden project 
where activism is now occurring to take ideas forward.  
We feel such expertise can be included and interrogated 
by, with and for the community without predetermining 
subsequent directions of the project.  Also, some of our 
designers did not find it easy to engage as specialists 
(bringing their design expertise to the project) given 
they are still undergraduates.  Not all the designers 
who engaged with the project were able to deliver the 
60
social interaction that is required for such community 
engagement, and for some of them the project made it 
clear this is not what they want to do in future, although 
other student designers made the opposite choice as 
already mentioned, and took to collaborative design for 
social innovation like ducks to water.
(v) Easy access to ideas and concepts.  Terms such as 
‘stakeholder’ and ‘duty holder’, ‘mapping’ and ‘assets,’ 
and ‘resources’ and ‘social innovation’, were found to be 
inaccessible to non-design actors, who are not familiar 
with service design methodologies.  One group (MA 
Applied Imagination) developed a toolkit for the 
co-articulation of desirable futures and how to tell a 
story that all actors could easily comprehend called 
‘The Magic Beans’.  These tools were designed to help 
diverse actors to envision new ways of doing things 
and help the actors to think through who is involved 
in the story, in what ways and what actions and assets 
are required from/by them to move forward.  We found 
such an approach interesting and progressive and a 
response to the problems the students encountered.  
This was a pleasing outcome of the project and 
provides a resource that could be used by and built 
upon by other students in future projects.
(vi) Funding.  No funding was in place and this put 
a pressure on the time and staffing allocations and 
ultimately access to design courses that we could work 
with at CSM.
(vii) Positive Outcomes.  The way the students and 
community reframed goals to accommodate student 
learning requirements was generous.  However, we felt 
as coordinators that the students may have got more 
out of the projects than the community, given that the 
community members wanted to continue to ‘harvest’ 
some more benefits from the work and were not in a 
position to do so because of project deadlines and no 
funding in place to implement designs.  As one of our 
residents pointed out; for him the project fell short 
because of the lack of implementation and realization.  
“The thing is here you have these designers, and a 
large percentage of the designs are practical solutions 
to problems, so why doesn’t anyone implement them? 
Sometimes it is a question of cost, for example the 
solution for Lissenden garden; it’s a lovely little 
[water] butt, but to build that thing will cost a fortune 
to implement.”  Another resident pointed out that the 
project he had worked on (rainwater car wash) led to 
61
“just a little bag you can put that together with £50 
or something and then just get Morrison’s and the 
companies who have premises with large ceilings to 
start implementing it — so why hasn’t that happened?”
The involvement of Camden Council may have produced 
some passivity in regards to implementation within 
the community given they are the official duty-holders.  
We recognize that some residents felt that Camden 
Council should take the project concepts they co-
developed forward, even though the project started in 
full acknowledgement of austerity conditions present in 
the UK and the fact there was no extra finance available 
from Camden Council.  Yet there was community hope 
that this might change and that extensive community 
fundraising would not need to take place in order for 
the ideas visualized to go forward and perhaps the 
community were not entirely wrong for having what 
Obama has called ‘the audacity of hope’.  The most 
positive outcome of the P&C project was that members 
of Green Camden who participated in the DESIS project 
went on to further exchange ideas (catalyzed by our 
students activity).  Notably in the context of water 
harvesting and the Lissenden gardens projects activism 
is now occurring, to take ideas forward.  It also brought 
some community activists in closer contact with our 
Research Centre.  As one commented:  ‘As a signposting 
collaboration, it was very successful!’
In many ways this Public and Collaborative project 
confirmed many of our prior understandings about how 
best to deliver co-design projects.  This project made 
us aware that prior community set up and dialogue 
at early stages before the project begins is crucial to 
the ability to co-design with the community.  Also that 
not all our designers were equally gifted in terms of 
sociability and/or find it easy to work with participatory 
design processes.  In our view these first Public and 
Collaborative projects are best seen as hybrid co-
design/user-centered design projects, which delivered 
over-determined product touchpoints or boundary 
objects in order to address services, mainly because of 
course restrictions (which meant students had to deliver 
a product to pass their degree).  Perhaps the most 
positive way of reviewing these projects is that they 
constitute ‘action scoping’ for the UAL DESIS Lab - a way 
of exploring possibilities for future collaboration (with 
Transition Towns and Camden Sustainability Team) and 
a way of delivering rapid prototyping of concepts with 
the community as part of a slow prototyping exercise 
IMPLICATIONS FOR:
DESIGN PRACTICE
1. Project as prototype – ‘Green Camden’ engaged a diverse community of social 
actors in a co-design process for the first time and should be viewed as a prototype.  
A holistic and equitable co-design project is dependent on establishment of 
commonality between actors in regard to the process and potentiality of design 
for social innovation.  A common understanding amongst actors of what design is 
and what design(ers) may contribute needs to be established and takes time.  In 
the absence of such understanding the project itself becomes a prototype toward 
development of such an understanding.  This project constitutes a single iteration 
within a ‘slow prototyping’1 approach to co-design with a community in that it may 
not have achieved the project objective of co-designing sustainable services that are 
implemented by communities (yet!) but builds ‘new capacities [that] are necessary for 
a new model to succeed’ Hillgren et al argue with Schulman that slow prototyping 
‘can be a way of creating good teams and to build capacity, which means enabling 
policy people, practitioners, and users to run parts of the prototype’2 and define 
‘infrastructuring’ as ‘characterized by a continuous process of building relations with 
diverse actors and by a quite flexible allotment of time and resources’.  Whilst this 
co-design infrastructure was absent at the outset of the project it’s development 
is evident by the social capital and experience/knowledge base that has been 
developed by the project.
2. Effectuation as a response to DESIS as situated practice – ‘Green Camden’ is an 
example of situated practice3 in that it is contingent on the situated context of the 
design process/project.  Ehn speaks of the impotence of meta-design to meet the 
‘unachievable design challenge of all-encompassing anticipation or envisioning of 
potential design to take place in use after project design’4. This challenge is amplified 
in socially situated practice.  The designers of the ‘Green Camden’ project responded 
to this challenge as best we could by drawing on the principles of effectuation5 as 
derived from entrepreneurial practices that apply adaptive and opportunistic tactics 
to deal with unpredictable scenarios.  Meta design has similarities with causal 
reasoning in that it assumes that ‘if one can predict the future one can control it’.  
Effectuation is predicated on the belief that ‘if one can control the future one does 
not need to predict it’.  In delivering the Green Camden project we were fast to adapt 
to challenges and opportunities, creating a scenario in which collaboration could 
occur between students and residents with shared concerns.  However, it transpired 
that whilst effectuation creates opportunity for innovation it does not necessarily 
foster the climate for community collaboration.  Suggesting that for innovation to

situations where new capacities are necessary for a new model to succeed. Fast prototyping methods are

be social and sustainable a ‘slow effectuation’ approach akin to ‘slow prototyping’ is 
necessary.  Although iterative effectuation would no doubt constitute such a process.
3. Forms of facilitation – The role of ‘designer as facilitator’ is commonly understood 
as one of enabling collaboration between diverse actors within the design process6.  
Within ‘Green Camden’ the role of designer as facilitator manifested in two forms; 
facilitation within the co-design process and facilitation within the process of 
social innovation.  In both instances the facilitation took a form described by Ehn 
as a ‘design device’7 that affords certain functions and a ‘design thing’ that opens 
up ‘new ways of thinking and behaving’.  The collaborative visioning tool – ‘The 
Magic Beans’ created by students from MA Applied Imagination is a boundary object 
that facilitates the co-design process.  Many of the products designed by students 
from BA Product Design aim to facilitate the collaborative delivery of public and 
collaborative services and in doing so facilitate social innovation.
DESIGN EDUCATION
1. DESIS takes time and resources - In attempting to engage with the resident 
communities rather than the business or council community ‘Green Camden’ 
sought the most challenging co-design environment in that the community 
was not immediately accessible and the infrastructures necessary for effective 
communication and collaboration most difficult to establish.  In relation to the 
achievement of the goal of co-designing services for sustainable ways of living to 
be co-delivered with and by residents this was a step too far given the time and 
resources available.  However, as a practical proof of concept it has been effective 
in demonstrating the need for and nature of ‘infrastructuring’ for co-design by and 
with HE and social actors and communities outside HE.  Similarly challenging was 
the attempt to deliver effective and sustainable public and collaborative service 
delivery (or other forms of DESIS) without economic resources for implementation.  
It is likely that both these challenges could have been met with time to establish a 
more diverse network of actors (including those with resources or assets that might 
be re-deployed to enable implementation of proposals) linked to a ‘slow prototyping’ 
approach as described above. 
2. Learning environments beyond the ‘Lab’ and HE – Just as student designers need 
to learn the skills and competencies to collaborate with non-designers within the 
context of co-design for sustainable social innovations so do non-designers need to 
learn not just how to be effective users of design – but more importantly – how to be 
co-designers i.e. able to collaborate an contribute in the design process.  Nussbaum 
glibly describes parallel trajectories to becoming a ‘design thinker’8  – paraphrased

as (i) a design school graduate develops business skills in a business environment 
and over time becomes a ‘design thinker’ and (ii) a business school graduate 
develops design skills in a design environment and over time becomes a ‘design 
thinker’.  Similarly, is there a trajectory to design-led social innovation for non-
designers just as there is a trajectory to design-led social innovation for designers?  
The contribution to the co-design process will be different but the appreciation of 
the process may be similar and thus the necessary commonality described above 
achieved.  Should we be teaching non-designers skills and competencies necessary 
for design for social innovation just as we teach designers?  Green Camden raises the 
question of how to ‘teach’ design for social innovation to non-designers and how to 
teach contextual nous to designers.  The need for education (knowledge exchange) 
between diverse actors and students outside the academy suggests a role for a 
DESIS ‘Lab’ that operates beyond the academy.  If the ’Lab’ environment is ‘in vitro’ (in 
HE) then the proposition is for ‘in vivo’ (outside HE) not just to deliver design practice 
but also reflection on design process and contextual (situated) understanding.
3. Not all designers are co-designers but all design is situated practice – DESIS 
projects offer potential not just in serving the community but also in serving design 
educators and students by giving students experiences that put them on the spot, in 
the heart of the communities and contexts they are trying to serve, and in doing so 
developing an understanding of design as a situated social practice.  In this scenario 
student designers learn by doing and deduce whether or not they enjoy working in 
sometimes demanding collaborative ways (our observation is that not all designers 
enjoy such contact or are as suited to it as others).  For student product designers 
specifically the process of engaging in a public and collaborative context exposes 
them to what Margolin describes as a ‘social model’9 of design that considers ‘product 
design within a process of social service intervention’.
DESIGN POLICY
The activity of our students served to start new community conversations and 
open up new opportunities that we believe would not have occurred without such 
engagement.  These opportunities demonstrated to Camden Council that design is 
not just something that is taken on at the end of a process to help deliver policy 
but rather, an approach that can be utilized to identify what policies are necessary 
to enable and facilitate desirable change within communities.  Camden Council, 
in asking us to engage with further initiatives in collaboration with community 
groups, have indicated to us that they realize that design can fulfill a role in helping 
communities better articulate and engage with definition of policy agendas as well 
as development and delivery of policy recommendations.  One outcome of this 
project has been that design educators have been asked to train Camden Council 
staff who finance and facilitate community projects linked to the Camden Social 
Innovation Fund which aims to help community groups to catalyze and implement 
social enterprises that address community needs and goals.  We are very pleased 
about this unexpected development.

Ultimately, students’ ideas, about how social enterprise can help sustain social 
innovations, appear to have been recognized by Camden.  It is evident that policy 
makers can benefit from the exposure and engagement that the process of co-design 
can deliver for new ways of thinking and doing.  However, whilst policy makers may 
recognize that the processes of co-design may appear as significant as the products of 
co-design in delivering sustainable behavior change, it is important that co-designed 
outputs are followed through to delivery or that the expectations of the communities 
engaged are understood and managed so as to ensure that disappointment does not 
lead to disenchantment with collaborative processes and a backlash against sustainable 
behaviors viewed as a cheap option for policy makers seeking to support communities. 
that will facilitate future project delivery.

BACKGROUND
In the complexity of contemporary society, social innovation is spreading and its potential, as a driver of 
sustainable change, is increasing. To facilitate this process, the design community, in general, and design schools, in 
particular, can play a pivotal role. Ezio Manzini, DESIS International  
Social Innovation  
“Social innovation is a new idea that works in meeting social goals” (Mulgan, 2006). In other words, social 
innovation can be seen as a process of change emerging from the creative re-combination of existing assets
