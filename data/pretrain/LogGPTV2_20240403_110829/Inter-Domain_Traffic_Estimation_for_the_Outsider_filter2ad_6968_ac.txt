### Traceroute Campaign Analysis

#### Traffic Distribution and Statistical Fit

The traffic distribution across links in the traceroute campaign follows a power-law distribution, as shown in Figure 4. This indicates that a few links carry the majority of the traffic, while the majority of the links carry very little traffic.

**Figure 4: Distribution of traffic for all peerings in the traffic matrix for IXP, April 2011.**

**Figure 5: Comparison of the goodness of fit of normalized traffic (blue line) with log-normal distribution. Dashed green line: log-normal fit starting from the optimal xmin=23.41, alpha=2.1. Dashed red line: exponential fit starting from the same xmin.**

Figure 5 provides statistical confirmation that the distribution of per-peering traffic (represented by the blue line) closely follows a log-normal distribution (dashed green line). This is consistent with previous observations of intra-domain traffic matrix snapshots [13, 39].

We observe similar distributions in the traffic carried by the links discovered in our traceroute datasets for both ISP and IXP in April 2011 and April 2013. This can be seen in Figure 6, which shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the cumulative fraction of traffic for all AS-links.

**Figure 6: Complementary CDF of the cumulative fraction of traffic for all AS-links of ISP and IXP discovered by our traceroute datasets.**

In all cases, a small fraction of the links carries the majority of the traffic. To approximate normality in the highly skewed distribution of traffic volume, we use the fourth root transformation (see Figure 7a).

**Figure 7: Distribution of the transformed different metrics and traffic volume for all AS-links discovered in the April 2011 traceroute datasets for IXP. Similar distributions are observed for the other datasets and the two studied network entities.**

#### Network Syntax Analysis

We begin by selecting ALTP-sets for all relevant AS-links that traverse IXP and ISP from our traceroute datasets. We generate separate AS-link connectivity graphs for each dataset and compute the different Network Syntax metrics for each link present in the graph. Finally, we plot each AS-link against the volume of traffic it carries as indicated by our traffic matrix.

To reduce potential noise in the correlations introduced by specific AS-links (e.g., due to sampling issues), we use the different metrics to order AS-links, breaking ties based on connectivity, and cluster them into equal-sized groups of ten links. For each group, we compute its value for both the relative corresponding metric and carried traffic as the average of the individual values of the AS-links within the group.

The different Network Syntax metrics present varied distributions. As shown in Figure 7e, the integration metric is already close to normal and is used without transformation. The control metric (Figure 7c) is approximately normalized with the help of a logarithmic transformation, while the rest of the metrics achieve the desired approximate normality using the fourth root transformation (see Figures 7b, 7d, and 7f).

**Figure 8 to 11: Correlations between the five Network Syntax metrics and traffic volume for the links of ISP and IXP found in our traceroute datasets.**

ALTP-frequency and connectivity have the strongest correlation coefficients, with the integration metric having the weakest. The correlation with ALTP-frequency has r² values as high as 0.95 (ISP in April 2013) and as low as 0.71 (IXP in April 2013). This strong correlation is likely due to ALTP-frequency more directly capturing the popularity of high-traffic links.

The connectivity metric also shows consistently strong correlations, with r² values ranging between 0.61 (IXP April 2011) and 0.95 (ISP April 2013). This metric captures the degree of each node in the connectivity graph, which corresponds to a different AS-link in our dual representation of the AS-level connectivity graph. A large connectivity value captures the number of different AS-links that precede or succeed it on the ALTPs identified, thus indirectly capturing the ALTP-frequency of the link.

The correlation between traffic volume and the control value metric, while still strong, is comparably lower, with a minimum r² value of 0.52 (IXP April 2013) and a maximum value of 0.76 (ISP April 2011). Although this metric is based on the connectivity values of a link’s neighbors, it can overestimate the popularity of an AS-link if the high connectivity of a neighbor is partially due to AS-links traversed by paths that never cross the link in question.

The integration metric highlights AS-links that have the shortest average path to every other AS-link in the network. The results for this metric show the largest variations in terms of correlation for the different datasets, ranging from 0.356 (IXP April 2013) to 0.826 (ISP April 2011).

Finally, the global choice metric takes into account the relations between each node and the whole system, indexing how often each line is used on topologically shortest paths from all lines to all other lines in the system. The figures show that the correlation of this metric with traffic volume is also significant, with r² values between 0.58 (IXP April 2013) and 0.90 (ISP April 2013).

**Table 2: r² values of the different metrics for ISP and IXP.**

| Metric | IXP Apr 2011 | IXP Apr 2013 | ISP Apr 2011 | ISP Apr 2013 |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Connectivity | 0.729 | 0.617 | 0.789 | 0.954 |
| Control Value | 0.685 | 0.521 | 0.759 | 0.750 |
| Global Choice | 0.661 | 0.580 | 0.653 | 0.903 |
| Integration | 0.575 | 0.356 | 0.826 | 0.629 |
| ALTP-freq | 0.799 | 0.713 | 0.965 | 0.958 |

The values in Table 2 show that, although the different datasets vary in their degree of correlation, the regression lines are generally coincident. A correlation coefficient greater than 0.5 is generally considered strong, and values greater than 0.8 are considered very strong. Nearly all (19/20) the r² values are above 0.5, and the ALTP-frequency values range between 0.7 and 0.96.

While the ALTP-frequency metric outperforms the rest, there is a strong correlation between the different metrics and traffic. Exploring the relationship between different variables is part of future work.

### Use Cases

#### Predicting Link Traffic

We have shown in Section 5.2 that the fraction of traffic carried by the AS-links identified in massive traceroute datasets strongly correlates with the different Network Syntax metrics when those links are clustered in small groups. We now demonstrate that it is possible to leverage this strong correlation to estimate the traffic volume of arbitrary links, even in the absence of ground-truth traffic data, as long as we have information about the traffic for a subset of the remaining links in the connectivity graph. We do this using the April 2013 datasets for ISP; similar results were obtained using the remaining datasets.

In this analysis, we employ a subset of the clusters of AS-links to compute the correlation and corresponding regression line between traffic volume and the Network Syntax metric with the strongest correlation: ALTP-frequency. We then use the computed parameters to estimate the traffic volume of the remaining clusters of links by using their ALTP-frequency as a proxy.

To reduce the number of links per cluster as much as possible, we start by generating clusters of size ten, as described in Section 5.2. We then remove, from each individual cluster, the AS-links that diverge from the median cluster ALTP-frequency by at least one standard deviation (a total of 25 links out of 147). This allows us to use the remaining links to generate clusters of half their original size while maintaining a similarly strong correlation. Figure 12 shows this correlation and corresponding regression line for ISP for clusters of size five for the remaining 122 links.

We vary the fraction of clusters used to compute the regression line from 65% to 85% of the available clusters (in increments of 5%) and compute the difference, in orders of magnitude, between the median estimated traffic values and the actual traffic values (from the ground-truth) for the remaining clusters. If the estimated and real value fall within the same order of magnitude, the difference is zero. A difference of 1 means we may have under/over-estimated the traffic volume by one order of magnitude.

**Figure 13: Median difference between estimated and actual traffic volumes for each of the different fractions.**

For the median case, approximately 80% of the estimated values fall within the same order of magnitude as the ground-truth values.

To characterize the size estimation errors for the link clusters with predicted and real values within the same order of magnitude, we compute the normalized mean absolute error between the median estimated and ground-truth traffic volumes. Figure 14 plots the mean estimation error for the different fractions of clusters used to compute the regression line.

**Figure 14: Mean estimation error for the different fractions of clusters used to compute the regression line.**

This analysis demonstrates the potential of using Network Syntax metrics to predict missing traffic link volumes in a connectivity graph, providing a valuable tool for network management and planning.
