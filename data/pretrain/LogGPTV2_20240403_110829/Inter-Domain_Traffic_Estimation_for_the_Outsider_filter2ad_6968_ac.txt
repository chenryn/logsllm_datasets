seen in Figure 6, the complimentary CDF of the cumulative
fraction of traﬃc for all the discovered AS-links.
In all
cases, a small fraction of the links carries the majority of
the traﬃc. To approximate normality in the cases where the
dependent variable denotes traﬃc volume, we use the fourth
root transformation for its highly skewed distribution (see
Figure 7a).
5.2 Network Syntax analysis
We start by selecting, from our traceroute datasets, the
ALTP-sets for all relevant AS-links that traverse IXP and
ISP . We generate separate AS-link connectivity graphs
for each dataset and compute the diﬀerent Network Syntax
metrics for each link present in the graph. Finally we
plot each AS-link against the volume of traﬃc it carries as
indicated by our traﬃc matrix.
To reduce the potential noise on the correlations intro-
duced by particular AS-links (e.g., due to sampling issues),
we use the diﬀerent metrics to order AS-links, breaking ties
based on connectivity, and cluster them in equal sized groups
of ten links 4. For each group, we compute its value for both
the relative corresponding metric and carried traﬃc, as the
average of the individual values of the AS-links within the
group.
The diﬀerent Network Syntax metrics present varied
distributions. As shown in Figure 7e, the integration
metric is already close to normal and is used without
transformation.
Furthermore, while the control metric
(Figure 7c) is approximately normalized with the help of
a logarithmic transformation, for the rest of the metrics, we
achieve the desired approximate normality using the fourth
root transformation (see Figures 7b, 7d and 7f). Having
transformed the distributions of the dependent (i.e., traﬃc
volume) as well as independent variables, we can study
4Diﬀerent clusters sizes yield similar trends.
the relationships between traﬃc volume and the diﬀerent
Network Syntax metrics.
Figures 8 to 11 show the correlations between the ﬁve
Network Syntax metrics and traﬃc volume for the links of
ISP and IXP found in our traceroute datasets. The ﬁgures
are presented side by side to facilitate horizontal and vertical
comparisons between metrics and across datasets.
ALTP-frequency and connectivity have the strongest cor-
relation coeﬃcients, with the integration metric having the
weakest one of all. The correlation with ALTP-frequency
has r2 values as high as 0.95 (ISP in April 2013) with the
lowest value at 0.71 (for IXP in April 2013). We argue
that this strong correlation comes from the fact that ALTP-
frequency more directly captures the popularity of the high-
traﬃc links.
The connectivity metric shows consistently strong correla-
tions as well, with r2 values ranging between 0.61 (for IXP
April 2011) to 0.95 (for ISP April 2013). Recall that this
metric captures the degree of each node in the connectivity-
graph which correspond to a diﬀerent AS-link in our dual
representation of the AS-level connectivity-graph. As such,
a large connectivity value captures the number of diﬀerent
AS-links that precede or succeeds it on the ALTPs identiﬁed.
The connectivity metric, then, captures the diversity of the
ALTPs that traverse through the link; it indirectly captures
the ALTP-frequency of the link.
The correlation between traﬃc volume and the control
value metric, while still strong, is comparably lower with
a minimum r2 value of 0.52 (for IXP April 2013) and a
maximum value of 0.76 (for ISP April 2011). Although
this metric is based on the connectivity values of a link’s
neighbors,
it can overestimate the popularity of an AS-
link given that the high connectivity of a neighbor can be
partially due to AS-links traversed by paths that never cross
the link in question.
The integration metric highlights the AS-links that have
the shortest average path to every other AS-link in the

network. The results for this metric present the largest
variations in terms of correlation for the diﬀerent datasets,
ranging from 0.356 (for IXP April 2013) to 0.826 (for ISP
2011).
Finally, recall that global choice takes into account the
relations between each node and the whole system.
It
indexes how often each line is used on topologically shortest
paths from all
lines to all other lines in the system.

for information that must traverse disparate parts of the

with traﬃc volume is also signiﬁcant, with r2 values between
0.58 (for IXP April 2013) and 0.90 (for ISP April 2013).

Table 2: r2 values of the diﬀerent metrics for ISP and IXP .
The values in Table 2 show that, although the diﬀerent
datasets vary in their degree of correlation, the regression
lines are more or less coincident. While varying with
context, a correlation coeﬃcient greater than 0.5 is generally
considered strong, and values greater than 0.8 as very strong
correlation. The table shows the values of the coeﬃcient
of determination resulting from our regression analysis –
nearly all (19/20) the r2 values are above 0.5 and the ALTP-
frequency values range between 0.7 and 0.96.
While the ALTP-frequency metric outperforms the rest
of the metrics, there is a strong correlation between the
diﬀerent metrics and traﬃc. Exploring the relationship
between diﬀerent variables is part of future work.
6. USE CASES
In this section, we illustrate the potential uses of Network
Syntax using two use-cases: (i) predicting missing traﬃc link
volumes in a connectivity graph and, (ii) ranking AS-Links
based on their traﬃc volume.
6.1 Predicting link trafﬁc
We have shown in Section 5.2 that the fraction of traﬃc
carried by the AS-links identiﬁed in massive traceroute
datasets strongly correlates with the diﬀerent Network
Syntax metrics when those links are clustered in small
groups. We now show that it is possible to leverage this
strong correlation to estimate the traﬃc volume of arbitrary
links, in the absence of ground-truth traﬃc data as long
as we have information about the traﬃc for a subset of
the remaining links in the connectivity graph. We do this
using the April 2013 datasets for ISP ; similar results were
obtained using the remaining datasets.
In this analysis we employ a subset of the clusters of AS-
links to compute the correlation and corresponding regres-
sion line between traﬃc volume and the Network Syntax
metric with the strongest correlation: ALTP-frequency. We
then use the computed parameters to estimate the traﬃc
volume of the remaining clusters of links by using their
ALTP-frequency as proxy.

To reduce the number of links per cluster as much as
possible, we start by generating clusters of size ten as
described in Section 5.2. We then remove,
from each
individual cluster, the AS-links that diverge from the median
cluster ALTP-frequency by at least one standard deviation
(a total of 25 links out of 147). This allows us to use the
remaining links to generate clusters of half their original size
while maintaining a similarly strong correlation.5 Figure 12
shows this correlation and corresponding regression line for
ISP for clusters of size ﬁve for the remaining 122 links.
We vary the fraction of clusters used to compute the
regression line from 65% to 85% of the available clusters
(in increments of 5%) and compute the diﬀerence, in orders
of magnitude, between the median estimated traﬃc values
and the actual traﬃc values (from the ground-truth) for the
remaining clusters.6
If the estimated and real value fall
within the same order of magnitude (say, between 0 and
10MB or between 10 and 100MB), then the diﬀerence is zero.
A diﬀerence between the estimated and real value of 1, on
the other hand, means we may have under/over-estimated
the traﬃc volume by one order of magnitude (e.g., declaring
it to be in 50MB when it is closer to 5MB).
Figure 13 shows the result of our analysis after repeating
our random selection for each percentage of clusters, 500
times. The ﬁgure plots the median diﬀerence between
estimated and actual traﬃc volumes for each of the diﬀerent
fractions. For the median case, ≈80% of the estimated

without removing any links from the original sets.
6We considered the use of OC-based bucketing for this case
study, but decided against it as our analysis compares groups
of links rather than individual ones.
values fall within the same order of magnitude as the ground-
truth values.
To characterize the size estimation errors for the link
clusters with predicted and real values within the same order
of magnitude, we compute the normalized mean absolute
error between the median estimated and ground-truth traﬃc
volumes. Figure 14 plots the mean estimation error for
the diﬀerent fractions of clusters used to compute the
