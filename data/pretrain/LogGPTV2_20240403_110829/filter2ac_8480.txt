titleblackhat:asia-21 The Cost of Complexity: Different Vulnerabilities While Implementing the Same RFC
Our presentation discusses a simple question: What is the security cost of complexity and ambiguity? We analyze this as measured in terms of vulnerable implementations.To explore this question, we analyzed a very specific part of multiple TCP/IP stacks: their implementation of RFC 1035, sub-chapter 4.1.4 titled "Message Compression". This part of the specification is less than 500 words long and is not as complex as its name might suggest. However, as it turns out, it is quite tricky to implement.Our research shows that these few lines of specification, which may be solving a problem that no longer exists, were implemented in multiple different ways, with different interpretations, and interestingly with similar vulnerabilities in several stacks. In total, including our own vulnerabilities and those previously reported, we will discuss over 15 stacks with vulnerable implementations of this feature.We will describe how exploits for these vulnerabilities can be detected using common and not too complex rules and talk about what this means for vulnerability research â€“ e.g., whether this could be used to discover close variants of vulnerabilities that exist cross-codebase.
