Currently (TS v.1.5.2) the compiler does not do inference correctly for
certain cases:
#3038
Although it is by design, reflected in the spec and there is no viable way for
doing it correctly, I think the compiler has to be honest to the developer and
instead of generating faulty code, it has to break with an error message that
would say that the inferred types cannot be resolved.
