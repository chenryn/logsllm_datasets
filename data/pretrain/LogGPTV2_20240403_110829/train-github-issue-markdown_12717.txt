Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Load the penguins dataset
penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")

# Create a displot with separate x-axes for each species
sns.displot(
    data=penguins,
    x="flipper_length_mm",
    col="species",
    facet_kws=dict(sharex=False, sharey=False)
)

# Display the plot
# ![Plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3391614/218545874-ff5a5360-3310-4cc7-b410-878fa7e266a6.png)

# Note: The x-axis is not shared across the subplots.
```

### Explanation:
- **Code Structure**: The code is now more structured and includes an `import` statement for `seaborn`.
- **Comments**: Added comments to explain the purpose of the code and the plot.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Improved the Markdown formatting for better readability.

This should make the text clearer, more coherent, and more professional.
