# Widdershins: The Hacker Nation
## Simple Nomad at DefCon X - 2002

### About Me/This Talk
- **NMRC (National Malware Research Center)**
- **BindView (Security Software Company)**
- **Skills Needed for Cybersecurity Professionals**

### The Year in Review
- **DMCA Enforcement**: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) saw increased enforcement.
- **Terrorism and Legislation**: New legislation aimed at clarifying and expanding previous laws, with more reactive legislation expected.
- **Government Surveillance**: Discussion on government-run anonymous remailers and their role in monitoring and decrypting communications.

### Packeteering Satan's Network
(Referencing "Programming Satan's Computer" by Ross Anderson and Roger Needham, 1995)

#### What Can Satan Sniff?
- **Discussion Highlights**: During the Q&A session, Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger, a conference attendee, provided insights into government surveillance:
  - **Anonymous Remailers**: Several U.S. government agencies run anonymous remailers to scan traffic. The NSA has developed systems to break encryption below 1000-bit key length, recommending at least 1024-bit keys.

- **Classified Information**: A former intelligence officer confirmed that while it is known that governments can decrypt PGP, the exact methods are classified. Disclosing these methods would be illegal.

### Types of Monitoring
- **Invasive**: Obvious monitoring nodes, significant traffic impact, and easy to detect and avoid.
- **Non-invasive**: Obvious monitoring nodes, minimal traffic impact, and relatively easy to avoid.
- **Stealth**: Non-obvious monitoring nodes, no traffic impact, and difficult to avoid.

### Types of Communication
- **Point-to-Point**: Direct communication (e.g., email).
- **Broadcast**: Wide dissemination (e.g., USENET).
- **Anonymous Sender**: Concealed sender (e.g., remailer).
- **Traffic Pattern Masking**: Concealing communication patterns (e.g., Loki).

### To Avoid Stealth Monitoring, Stealth Communications Are Needed
- **Stealth Communications**: Sender and receiver are unknown, messages are encrypted, and communication is indistinguishable from regular traffic.

### Scenarios for Stealth Communications
1. **Stealth Digital Drop Box using Holepunch**: Securely exchange files without direct communication.
2. **Steganography using Outguess and Porn**: Hide data within seemingly innocuous images.
3. **Stealth Traffic Pattern Masking using Masquerade**: Conceal communication patterns to avoid detection.
4. **Anonymous Point-to-Point Communications Using CliqueNet**: Ensure anonymity and security in direct communications.

### Dining Cryptographers Problem
- **Basics of DC Net**: Ensuring anonymity in a group.
- **Scaling with CliqueNet**: Solving scalability issues for large networks.

### Conclusion
- **Questions?**: All questions must be in the form of an answer.
