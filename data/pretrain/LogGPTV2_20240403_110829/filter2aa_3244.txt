The Problem:
Packeteering Satan's Network
(Programming Satan's Computer - Ross Anderson and Roger Needham 1995)
What Can Satan Sniff?
During the question and answer session, an interesting discussion ensued. Here is a quote from 
conference attendee Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger:
"Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous remailers in the US are run by 
government agencies scanning traffic. Marlow said that the government runs at least a dozen remailers 
and that the most popular remailers in France and Germany are run by the respective government 
agencies in these countries. In addition they  mentioned that the NSA has successfully developed systems 
to break encrypted messages below 1000 bit of key length and strongly suggested to use at least 1024 bit 
keys. They said that they themselves use 1024 bit keys."
"Anonymous Re-mailers as Risk-Free International Infoterrorists" presented by Paul Strassmann, 
National Defense University and William Marlow, Science Applications International Corporation. 
Presented at the "Information, National Policies, and International Infrastructure" conference at Harvard 
Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 30, 1996.

What Can Satan Sniff?
"Disclosing the method of attacking PGP would involve disclosing classified cryptographic analysis 
methods (I was taught by the government), and such a disclosure to uncleared persons would be seriously 
illegal (in wartime such a disclosure carries the death penalty).
Seriously though, I would love to lay out the holes in several crypto systems, and would love to disclose 
the methods for breaking PGP, DES, and a number of other civilian crypto system I have studied (in
multiple NSA crypto schools); but will not disclose information and/or methods I know to be classified."
and
"The fact that various world governments can perform a PGP decrypt is old news, and not classified, 
however; the exact method used for the decrypt is what is classified."

Types of Monitoring
Invasive, Non-invasive, Stealth
Types of Monitoring
Non-invasive - Monitoring nodes are obvious. Little to 
no traffic impact. Usually easy to avoid.
Types of Monitoring
Stealth - Monitoring nodes are not obvious. No 
traffic impact. Hard to avoid.
Types of Communication
Point to Point (e.g. Email)
Broadcast (e.g. USENET)
Types of Communication
Anonymous Sender (e.g. 
Remailer) 
Traffic Pattern Masking (e.g. 
Loki)
To Avoid Stealth Monitoring, 
Stealth Communications Are 
Needed
Stealth Communications - Sender/receiver 
unknown. Message encrypted. 
Communication not obvious, difficult to 
discern from regular traffic.
