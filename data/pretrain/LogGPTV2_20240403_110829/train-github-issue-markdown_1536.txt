To facilitate the development of cross-compilation tooling, it would be beneficial to programmatically obtain the possible combinations of `GOOS` and `GOARCH`. The primary reference for these environment variables can be found at [the Go documentation](http://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment). However, this resource, along with the command `go help environment`, only provides examples. Additionally, the commands `go help build` and `go help install` do not mention `GOOS` and `GOARCH` at all. 

For a more streamlined and comprehensive approach, it would be ideal to have an official and easily accessible list or API that returns all valid `GOOS` and `GOARCH` combinations. This would greatly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of cross-compilation tooling.
