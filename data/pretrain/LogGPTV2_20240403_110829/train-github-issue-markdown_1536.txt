To easier write tooling for cross compiling it would be good to
programmatically get the possible combinations of GOOS and GOARCH.
The only reference I can find is at
http://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment
In addition, `go help environment`only gives examples; and`go help build` and
`go help install`does not mention GOOS and GOARCH.
