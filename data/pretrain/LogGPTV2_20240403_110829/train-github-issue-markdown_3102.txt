 **Migrated issue, originally created by Michael Bayer (@zzzeek)**
The `orm/inheritance/abc_inheritance` test relies upon `fold_equivalents` to
spell out a UNION which builds a polymorphic discriminator column on the fly.
This whole use case (i.e., joined table inheritance with no discriminator
column) is more easily managed by using regular joined table inheritance,
joining to all tables (i.e. with_polymorphic), and using a callable
`polymorphic_on` function which checks for the presence of each joined table
in order to determine the type. This is an easy enhancement and makes us
compatible with Hibernate's joined table inheritance behavior. the whole
`fold_equivalents` feature ~~which nobody is using anyway can then be
removed~~ won't be needed in this case (a nicer fold_equivalents proposed in
#1729).
