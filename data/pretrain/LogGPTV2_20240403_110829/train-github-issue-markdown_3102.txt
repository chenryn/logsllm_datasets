**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Michael Bayer (@zzzeek)**

The `orm/inheritance/abc_inheritance` test currently relies on the `fold_equivalents` function to generate a UNION that dynamically creates a polymorphic discriminator column. 

However, this use case—specifically, joined table inheritance without a dedicated discriminator column—can be more effectively managed using standard joined table inheritance. This involves joining all relevant tables (using `with_polymorphic`) and employing a callable `polymorphic_on` function. The `polymorphic_on` function would check for the presence of each joined table to determine the type. This approach simplifies the implementation and aligns with Hibernate's behavior for joined table inheritance.

By adopting this method, the need for the `fold_equivalents` feature in this context is eliminated. Additionally, a more refined version of `fold_equivalents` has been proposed in issue #1729.
