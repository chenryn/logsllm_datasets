ciple of encoding attacks is uncovered. Based on this principle,
we propose two generic and more efﬁcient encoding attacks.
In addition, we propose a generic method for transforming an
arbitrary GPM to a PMTE. We prove that PMTEs transformed
by this method are information-theoretically indistinguishable
from the corresponding GPMs, thus can resist encoding at-
tacks. Using this transforming method, we simplify the task of
designing a secure PMTE to the task of designing an accurate
GPM. Designing such a GPM needs professional knowledge
of real messages, we leave it to experts in related ﬁelds for
future work.

Figure 5: RCDFs of our proposed IS-PMTEs under the strong
encoding attack. Note that RCDFs of IS-PMTEs under the
weak encoding attack are all equal to the baseline and these
under the KL divergence attack are the same as those of the
corresponding existing PMTEs in Figure 4.

Golla et al.’s adaptive GPM 54.25% 45.75% 0.00% 100.00%
Note: RCDFs of IS-PMTEs under the KL divergence attack are
the same as those of existing PMTEs, therefore these metrics
under this attack are the same as those in Table 1. RCDFs of
IS-PMTEs under the weak encoding attack are the same as those
under the randomly guessing attack, therefore these metrics are
trivial (50% for r, 50% for α, 0% for F(0) and 100% for F−1(1)).
attack degenerates to the randomly guessing attack (with a
constant weight function). In contrast, the weight function
pGSEA of the strong encoding attack is inconstant, therefore,
RCDFs under the strong encoding attack depend on GPMs.
To evaluate the security of IS-PMTEs for existing vault
models under the strong encoding attack, it is necessary to
implement the random selection method for generating paths
with the parsing function G−1. However, in existing GPMs for
password vaults, there are numerous generating paths for mes-
sages (as discussed in Section 4.4), therefore, it has high time
complexity to parse all generating paths (see the discussion
in Appendix C). For example, in Chatterjee et al.’s GPM [10],
a vault V = (123456,password) can be generated by any sub-
grammar containing SG = {S → D, S → W, D → 123456,
W → password}. It has high time complexity to enumerate all
these sub-grammars and calculate the probabilities of generat-
ing V by them. Instead, we carry out simulation experiments
under the degenerated form of the strong encoding attack
with the weight function pSEA. Because all generating paths
are encoding paths, there is no seed S with pSEA(S) = 0, i.e.,
pSEA(S) = 1
P(RS) for every seed S. Accordingly, we use this
weight function to sort the seeds in simulation experiments.
Compared to the existing PMTEs, IS-PMTEs transformed

Proof of Theorem 3. IS-DTE is correct, therefore, the com-
bination IS-CDTE = {IS-DTEX}X∈X is correct. In addition,
because R S is preﬁx-free, the padding bits can be ignored
unambiguously when decoding. Thus, IS-PMTE is correct.
i=1 be the
generating sequence of S, then the length of padding bits is
lnmax − ln and
