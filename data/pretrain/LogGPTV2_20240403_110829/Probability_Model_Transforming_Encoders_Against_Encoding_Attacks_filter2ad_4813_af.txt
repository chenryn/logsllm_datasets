### Uncovering the Principle of Encoding Attacks and Proposing New Methods

The underlying principle of encoding attacks has been uncovered. Based on this principle, we propose two generic and more efficient encoding attacks. Additionally, we introduce a generic method for transforming an arbitrary General Probabilistic Model (GPM) into a Probabilistic Message Transformation Engine (PMTE). We prove that PMTEs transformed using this method are information-theoretically indistinguishable from their corresponding GPMs, thereby enabling them to resist encoding attacks. This transformation method simplifies the task of designing a secure PMTE to the task of designing an accurate GPM. The design of such a GPM requires professional knowledge of real messages, which we leave to experts in related fields for future work.

### Evaluation of IS-PMTEs Under Strong Encoding Attack

**Figure 5: RCDFs of Our Proposed IS-PMTEs Under the Strong Encoding Attack**

Note that the RCDFs of IS-PMTEs under the weak encoding attack are all equal to the baseline, and those under the KL divergence attack are the same as those of the corresponding existing PMTEs in Figure 4.

**Table 2: Performance of Our IS-PMTEs Under the Strong Encoding Attack**

| Probability Model | r (%) | α (%) | F(0) (%) | F−1(1) (%) |
|-------------------|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| Chatterjee et al.’s GPM | 47.44 | 52.56 | 0.00 | 97.60 |
| Golla et al.’s Static GPM | 53.62 | 46.38 | 0.41 | 100.00 |
| Golla et al.’s Adaptive GPM | 54.25 | 45.75 | 0.00 | 100.00 |

**Note:** 
- The RCDFs of IS-PMTEs under the KL divergence attack are the same as those of existing PMTEs, so these metrics under this attack are the same as those in Table 1.
- The RCDFs of IS-PMTEs under the weak encoding attack are the same as those under the randomly guessing attack, making these metrics trivial (50% for r, 50% for α, 0% for F(0), and 100% for F−1(1)).

### Analysis of Strong Encoding Attack

In the strong encoding attack, the weight function \( p_{\text{GSEA}} \) is non-constant, leading to RCDFs that depend on the GPMs. To evaluate the security of IS-PMTEs for existing vault models under the strong encoding attack, it is necessary to implement the random selection method for generating paths with the parsing function \( G^{-1} \). However, in existing GPMs for password vaults, there are numerous generating paths for messages, resulting in high time complexity to parse all generating paths (see Appendix C for further discussion).

For example, in Chatterjee et al.’s GPM, a vault \( V = (123456, \text{password}) \) can be generated by any sub-grammar containing \( SG = \{ S \rightarrow D, S \rightarrow W, D \rightarrow 123456, W \rightarrow \text{password} \} \). Enumerating all these sub-grammars and calculating the probabilities of generating \( V \) by them is computationally intensive. Instead, we conduct simulation experiments under the degenerated form of the strong encoding attack with the weight function \( p_{\text{SEA}} \). Since all generating paths are encoding paths, there is no seed \( S \) with \( p_{\text{SEA}}(S) = 0 \), i.e., \( p_{\text{SEA}}(S) = \frac{1}{P(R_S)} \) for every seed \( S \). We use this weight function to sort the seeds in our simulation experiments.

Compared to existing PMTEs, IS-PMTEs transformed using our method show improved performance in resisting strong encoding attacks.

### Proofs in Section 5

**Proof of Theorem 1:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Adv}_{\text{DTE,real}}^{\text{dte,S}}(B) &= \left| \Pr[B(S) = 1 : M \leftarrow \Pr_{\text{real}} M ; S \leftarrow \text{encode}(M)] - \Pr[B(S) = 1 : S \leftarrow \$ S] \right| \\
&= \left| \Pr[A(S, M') = 1 : M \leftarrow \Pr_{\text{real}} M ; S \leftarrow \text{encode}(M); M' \leftarrow \text{decode}(S)] - \Pr[A(S, M') = 1 : S \leftarrow \$ S; M' \leftarrow \text{decode}(S)] \right| \\
&= \left| \Pr[A(S, M) = 1 : M \leftarrow \Pr_{\text{real}} M ; S \leftarrow \text{encode}(M)] - \Pr[A(S, M) = 1 : S \leftarrow \$ S; M \leftarrow \text{decode}(S)] \right| \\
&= \text{Adv}_{\text{DTE,real}}^{\text{dte,A}}(A).
\end{aligned}
\]

**Proof of Theorem 2:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Adv}_{\text{DTE,real}}^{\text{dte,M}}(B) &= \left| \Pr[B(M) = 1 : M \leftarrow \Pr_{\text{real}} M ] - \Pr[B(M) = 1 : S \leftarrow \$ S; M \leftarrow \text{decode}(S)] \right| \\
&= \left| \Pr[A(S') = 1 : M \leftarrow \Pr_{\text{real}} M ; S' \leftarrow \text{encode}(M)] - \Pr[A(S') = 1 : S \leftarrow \$ S; M \leftarrow \text{decode}(S); S' \leftarrow \text{encode}(M)] \right| \\
&= \left| \Pr[A(S) = 1 : M \leftarrow \Pr_{\text{real}} M ; S \leftarrow \text{encode}(M)] - \Pr[A(S) = 1 : S \leftarrow \$ S] \right| \\
&= \text{Adv}_{\text{DTE,real}}^{\text{dte,A}}(A).
\end{aligned}
\]

**Proof of Theorem 3:**

IS-DTE is correct, and therefore, the combination IS-CDTE = {IS-DTEX}X∈X is correct. Additionally, because RS is prefix-free, the padding bits can be ignored unambiguously when decoding. Thus, IS-PMTE is correct.

Let \( S \) be a seed of the message \( M \), and let \( R_S = (r_i)^n_{i=1} \) be the generating sequence of \( S \). The length of the padding bits is \( l_{\text{max}} - l \), and

\[
P_{\text{encode}}(S | M) = \frac{1}{2^{l_{\text{max}} - l}} \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(r_i).
\]
