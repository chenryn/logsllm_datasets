## Abstract
The Internet is vulnerable to overloading caused by flash crowds and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Recently, Voice over IP (VoIP), an Internet-based service, has experienced phenomenal growth. As its deployment spreads, VoIP systems are likely to become attack targets, with flooding being a common threat due to its simplicity and the abundance of tool support. DDoS attacks and flash crowds can degrade the performance of call processing servers to the point where they become sluggish and even unresponsive. The challenge for network administrators is to differentiate between malicious and legitimate call requests, which may appear similar in content but differ in intent.

In this paper, we show that while DDoS attacks and flash crowds share similarities in message structure and the number of INVITE messages they generate, they exhibit different traffic patterns, making them distinguishable. We also introduce a new entropy-based approach to detect DDoS attacks that masquerade as flash crowds. Our approach is based on the observation that the creation of malicious sessions affects the entropy of call durations, providing an important clue for mimicry attack detection. As an overloading preventive measure, we exploit the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)'s inbuilt reliability mechanisms and exponential backoff timer values to regulate and distinguish legitimate call requests from spoofed ones.

## I. Introduction
The Internet is vulnerable to overloading caused by DDoS attacks and flash crowds. Both DDoS attacks and flash crowds result in a large number of service requests on a server. Under such overloading conditions, the target server becomes sluggish and unresponsive due to resource limitations. In a flash crowd, a large number of legitimate users try to access the server's resources simultaneously, whereas DDoS attacks contain malicious requests aimed at subverting the normal operations of the server.

IP telephony, being an Internet-based service, is equally vulnerable to overloading caused by flash crowds or DDoS attacks. In the past, there have been many instances when SS7-based landline and wireless telephone systems experienced flash crowds. For example, in 1996, a televoting event resulted in 2.5 million people calling two telephone numbers within two hours to vote "yes" or "no" on ITV's television program "Monarchy, Yes or No." Similarly, New York's landline and wireless telephone systems experienced flash crowd events during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the North American blackout on August 14, 2003. It is reasonable to predict that IP telephone systems may face similar flash crowd events.

Furthermore, the VoIP architecture pushes intelligence toward end devices (such as IP phones and PCs), which is contrary to traditional telephone systems (generally known as Public Switched Telephone Network [PSTN]) where end devices are relatively simple. Therefore, VoIP systems are much more susceptible to flash crowds and flooding attacks than the PSTN.

### Overloading Cases
A sudden surge of SIP INVITE (i.e., call setup) requests on a SIP proxy server poses a critical threat to telephone systems because this is the only request that takes some time to complete, and for that duration, the transaction state is maintained at the SIP proxy server. Consequently, INVITE flooding attacks and flash crowds exhaust the server resources, affecting its performance.

In our study, we consider four separate cases that may cause overloading on a SIP proxy server:
1. **INVITE Flooding Attack:** From a single or multiple hosts distributed over the Internet.
2. **Legitimate Call Surge:** Due to a flash crowd event.
3. **Mimic Flash Crowd Attack:** An attacker may use a telephone directory and a large number of compromised hosts implanted with malicious SIP message generation scripts to mimic a flash crowd.
4. **Complete Call Mimicry:** A SIP client may mimic a flash crowd by making complete calls (going through the exchange of call setup messages), hanging up, and then trying again in quick succession.

### Challenges
IP telephony INVITE floods are the application-layer equivalent of SYN flooding. Detecting this particular cause of a DoS is relatively straightforward, and significant work has been done in this area. Similarly, the effort to differentiate between flash crowds and DDoS attacks is not new and is generally considered a hard problem to solve. Jun et al. [7] studied the characteristics of flash crowds and DDoS attacks on websites. However, compared to their analysis of web traffic, IP telephony, being a time-sensitive service, requires fast detection and differentiation. Further, the study of web traffic patterns relying on IP addresses is not foolproof, as an attacker can launch a DDoS attack from a single location using spoofed IP addresses or may use a network of zombies with real IP addresses.

Kandula et al. [8] proposed CAPTCHAs to protect web servers from DDoS attacks that masquerade as flash crowds. However, in comparison to web browsers, telephones range from low-end, limited-functionality IP phones (possibly without any display) to more powerful modern PCs. Therefore, image-based CAPTCHAs are not effective solutions. Additionally, in the telephony world, asking for the active involvement of callers to solve audio or image-based puzzles is not an intuitive solution and may deter many potential users.

In a closed-loop feedback control system, overload detection is performed at the victim’s side, and load control is applied. This approach can help in managing and mitigating the impact of overloading on VoIP networks.
