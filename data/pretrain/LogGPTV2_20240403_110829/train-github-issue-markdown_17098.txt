I lost most of my work last night when there were problems on the server. I
think this is the 4th time this has happened with my account. My points number
reflects over 300 while my map does not.  
I have been working at this for close to a year, if not over a year.  
And the issue was closed even though my map is not restored to where it should
be.

Help please
