Subject: Urgent Assistance Required - Repeated Data Loss on Server #3629

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the recurring issue of data loss that I have experienced with my account. Last night, I lost a significant amount of work due to server problems. This is the fourth time this has occurred, and it is causing considerable frustration and disruption to my progress.

I have been working on this project for nearly a year, and the inconsistency in my account's data is becoming increasingly problematic. My points number currently reflects over 300, but my map does not accurately reflect this. Despite the issue being marked as resolved, my map has not been restored to its correct state.

I kindly request your immediate assistance in resolving this matter. It is crucial that my work is properly restored and that measures are taken to prevent such issues from recurring in the future.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
