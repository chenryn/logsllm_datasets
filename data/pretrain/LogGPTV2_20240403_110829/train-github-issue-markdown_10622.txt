When copying a segment of code that starts with a new-line followed by tabbed-
in code while "Auto Indent On Paste" is enabled, consecutive pastes will each
be an additional tab deeper. I tested this with C++, Java, and JavaScript
which makes me believe it is not a problem with the language specs.
Here is an example in the form of an animated gif:

It isn't just comments that this happens with, but it does require the
previous line to be selected. Specifically, this happens when the copy-buffer
matches a regex like `/^\n\s+[^\s]/`. That is, it starts with a newline,
followed by one or more whitespace characters and then a non-whitespace
character. And the previous line must be a blank line.
