### Subscription Core Description and Rationale

| Control | Severity | Automated Fix Script | Description |
|---------|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Minimize the Number of Admins/Owners** | Medium | Yes | Each additional person in the Owner or Contributor role increases the attack surface for the entire subscription. The number of members in these roles should be kept to a minimum. |
| **Justify All Identities with Admin/Owner Access** | Medium | Yes | Accounts that are members of these groups without a legitimate business reason increase the risk for your subscription. Carefully review and remove accounts that should not be there to avoid potential attacks if those accounts are compromised. |
| **Mandatory Central Accounts Must Be Present** | High | Yes | Certain central accounts are required in all subscriptions to support enterprise-wide functions (e.g., security scanning, cost optimization). The script checks for the presence of such 'mandatory' and 'scenario-specific' accounts. If these are not present, there may be security or functionality impacts. |
| **Deprecated/Stale Accounts Must Not Be Present** | Critical | Yes | Deprecated accounts, once deployed for trial/pilot initiatives, are no longer needed and pose a standing risk if present in any role on the subscription. |
| **Do Not Grant Permissions to External Accounts** | High | No | Non-AD accounts (e.g., PI:EMAIL) within a subscription subject your cloud assets to undue risk. These accounts are not managed to the same standards as enterprise tenant identities and do not have multi-factor authentication enabled. |
| **Service Accounts Should Not Support MFA and Should Not Be Used for Subscription Activity** | High | No | Service accounts are typically not MFA-capable. Using them in privileged roles exposes the subscription to 'credential theft'-related attack vectors. |
| **Limit the Number of Classic Administrators** | High | Yes | The v1 (ASM-based) version of Azure resource access model did not have much RBAC granularity, leading to the use of Co-administrator roles. In the v2 (ARM-based) model, this is not required, and the current limit of 2 classic admins is for backward compatibility. |
| **Use of Management Certificates Is Not Permitted** | High | Yes | Management certificates from the v1 model are risky due to lax key management hygiene. They have no role in the ARM-based model and should be cleaned up if found. |
| **Resolve Pending Azure Security Center (ASC) Alerts** | High | Yes | Based on the policies enabled in the subscription, ASC raises alerts indicative of resources that may be under attack or need immediate attention. Promptly resolve these alerts to eliminate exposure to attacks. |
| **Service Principal Names (SPNs) Should Not Be Owners or Contributors** | Medium | Yes | SPNs, like AD-based service accounts, have a single credential and cannot support MFA. Adding SPNs to 'Owners' or 'Contributors' roles is risky. |
| **Protect Critical Application Resources with Resource Locks** | Medium | Yes | A resource lock protects critical resources from accidental deletion. Proper RBAC configuration can prevent deletion while allowing other operations. |
| **Use ARM Policies to Audit or Deny Certain Activities** | Medium | Yes | ARM policies configured by AzSK generate audit log entries for actions that violate policies, raising visibility to potentially insecure actions. |
| **Configure Alerts for Critical Actions on Subscriptions and Resources** | High | Yes | Insights-based alerts notify the security point of contact about sensitive activities, such as adding a new member to the 'Owners' group or deleting a firewall setting. |
| **Do Not Use Custom-Defined RBAC Roles** | Medium | Yes | Custom RBAC roles are tricky to get right and require rigorous review. Use out-of-box roles ('Owners', 'Contributors') whenever possible. |
| **Do Not Use Any Classic Resources** | Medium | Yes | Use new ARM/v2 resources, which provide several security enhancements such as stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, and AAD-based authentication. |
| **Do Not Use Any Classic Virtual Machines** | High | Yes | Use new ARM/v2 virtual machines for enhanced security features. |
| **Verify the List of Public IP Addresses** | High | Yes | Public IPs expose cloud resources to public network attacks. Carefully scrutinize and review their use. |
| **Enable PIM for Privileged Access to Subscription Level Roles** | High | Yes | PIM (Privileged Identity Management) helps manage, control, and monitor access, mitigating the risk of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access rights. |
| **Enable PIM for Privileged Access to Resource Group Level Roles** | High | Yes | PIM helps manage, control, and monitor access to resource groups, mitigating the risk of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access rights. This control is executed only during CA scan. |
| **Set Mandatory Tags per Organization Policy** | High | Yes | Certain tags are required in all resources to support enterprise-wide functions. The script checks for the presence of 'mandatory' and 'scenario-specific' tags. |
| **Enable Standard Tier for Azure Security Center** | High | Yes | ASC standard tier enables advanced threat detection capabilities, including built-in behavioral analytics and machine learning. |
| **Rotate Credentials Approaching Expiry** | High | Yes | Periodic credential rotation minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise and ensures the availability of existing apps. |
| **Correctly Configure ASC Policies** | High | Yes | ASC security policies define the desired configuration of workloads and help ensure compliance with security requirements. Correct configuration provides a baseline layer of protection. |
| **Set Auto Provisioning to ON in ASC** | High | Yes | When auto provisioning is ON, ASC provisions the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) on all supported Azure VMs, enabling monitoring of various security parameters. |
| **Configure Security Contact Details in ASC** | High | Yes | Security contact information is used by Microsoft to contact you if the MSRC discovers that your customer data has been accessed by an unlawful or unauthorized party. |
| **Remove Access for Deleted Objects** | Medium | Yes | Remove access for deleted objects to maintain good security hygiene. |
| **Remove Access for Applications Without Owners** | High | Yes | Remove access for applications without owners to ensure accountability for any accidental or malicious activity. |
| **Ensure Users Do Not Have Additional Access via Apps They Own** | High | Yes | Identify and clean up inadvertent access vectors, such as users who may still own or possess credentials of an SPN with privileged access. |
| **Revoke Access for Inactive Applications/Users** | Medium | Yes | Revoke access for applications/users who are not actively using the subscription to reduce the risk of malicious activity. |

This table provides a clear and structured overview of the controls, their severity, and whether an automated fix script is available.
