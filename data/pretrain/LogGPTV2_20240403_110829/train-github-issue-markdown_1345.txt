When attempting to compile the following Rust program using `rustc`, I encountered an internal compiler error:

```
task failed at 'assertion failed: is_utf8(v)', C:\bot\slave\dist2-win\build\src\libstd\str.rs:1032
error: internal compiler error: unexpected failure
note: the compiler hit an unexpected failure path. This is a bug.
note: try running with RUST_LOG=rustc=1 to get further details and report the results to https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues
task failed at 'explicit failure', c:\bot\slave\dist2-win\build\src\librustc\rustc.rs:391
```

The program in question is as follows:

```rust
extern mod extra;
use extra::json::ToJson;

fn main() {
    let l = ~[1, 2, 3, 4];
    println!(l.iter().filter(|&x| *x > 2).map(|&x| x).to_owned_vec().to_json().to_str());
}
```

This error occurred on both Windows 8.1 (64-bit) and Windows XP (32-bit).

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure you have the Rust compiler (`rustc`) installed.
2. Save the provided Rust code to a file, e.g., `main.rs`.
3. Run the command `rustc main.rs` in your terminal or command prompt.

### Additional Information:
- The error message suggests that the issue is a bug in the Rust compiler.
- To gather more detailed information, you can run the compiler with the `RUST_LOG=rustc=1` environment variable set, like so: `RUST_LOG=rustc=1 rustc main.rs`.
- The detailed logs should be reported to the Rust issue tracker at [https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues).

If you encounter this issue, please follow the steps above to gather more information and report it to the Rust community for further investigation.
