I try to compile this program in rustc but an internal compile error occurred
that:
    task  failed at 'assertion failed: is_utf8(v)', C:\bot\slave\dist2-win\build\src\libstd\str.rs:1032
    error: internal compiler error: unexpected failure
    note: the compiler hit an unexpected failure path. this is a bug
    note: try running with RUST_LOG=rustc=1 to get further details and report the results to github.com/mozilla/rust/issues
    task  failed at 'explicit failure', c:\bot\slave\dist2-win\build\src\librustc\rustc.rs:391
this is my program:
    extern mod extra;
    use extra::json::ToJson;
    fn main () {
      let l = ~[1, 2, 3, 4];
      println(l.iter().filter(|&x| *x > 2).map(|&x| x).to_owned_vec().to_json().to_str());
    }
This error occurred both in Windows 8.1 64bit and windows XP 32bit.
