and 4.68 M domains (com). For the re-registration ana-
lysis, we subtract one year from the expiration date of
domains in the “auto-renew” expiration interval, and we
use only the ﬁrst and last observed Whois response per
domain. The result of the last lookup is either “domain
not found,” in which case no re-registration has been
observed, or it is a valid record containing the creation
date of the new re-registration instance.
3.5 Limitations
Since we seed our system with domains that are re-
moved from zone ﬁles, our study does not include do-
mains that are registered but do not appear in a DNS
zone, such as when the domain is not meant to resolve.
Our study excludes manually deleted domains since
the deletion may be unrelated to the expiration date,
which in turn is the basis for our re-registration analysis.
Similarly, we analyse only domains that go through
the redemption and pending delete periods, which guar-
antees that they are removed from the DNS zone. We
cannot characterise private domain sales or auctions
that result in ownership transfers rather than expira-
tion, deletion and re-registration cycles because such
transfers may keep the domain active in the DNS zone
and retain the original creation date in the Whois data.
Note however that we can quantify re-registrations no
matter if a domain re-appears in the DNS zone or not
since we use Whois signals for detection.
4. RE-REGISTRATION ANALYSIS
In our measurement, we added samples of domains re-
moved from DNS zones each day for seven months and
tracked them until the end of our measurement after
ten months. From a statistical point of view, our re-
registration data is right-censored because the observa-
tion period is not the same for all domains. A common
way to deal with such data is survival analysis, for which
we use the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator [14].
The survival function S(t) corresponds to the prob-
ability that an expired domain has not yet been re-
registered after time t. We deﬁne the random variable
T to represent the time between a domain’s expiration
date and the next creation date. Note that under this
deﬁnition, the re-registration delay T includes a time
span during which the domain has already expired but
is not yet available for re-registration because it is still
in the auto-renew, redemption or pending delete state.
We include expiration delays in our deﬁnition because
it is diﬃcult to predict when a domain will be available
for re-registration, as we will show below. With F (t)
the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of T , the
survival function is deﬁned as follows:
S(t) = P r[T > t] = 1 − F (t)
The KM estimator makes no assumption about the dis-
tribution of re-registration delays. Its input is the set of
observed re-registration delays as deﬁned above and, for
5
In fact, the ﬁrst clearly visible increase of domain
re-registrations begins around day 35. Although these
represent only a tiny fraction overall (0.1 % of com do-
mains are re-registered before day 40), they again con-
tradict the common misconception of an 80-day deletion
delay. Based on our understanding of domain states
(Figure 1), domains re-registered around day 35 likely
never entered the auto-renew grace period but were in-
stead deleted by the registrar on the expiration date,
which made them go directly into redemption period.
This seems to be a matter of how registrars implement
EPP state transitions on their end. When looking at the
prior registrars of domains re-registered before 50 days,
we ﬁnd that there are only relatively few of them, and
around half or more of the re-registrations of their prior
domains occur within 50 days, which suggests that those
state transitions are regular behaviour for these regis-
trars. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate that there is
no general pattern to predict domain deletion delays on
a per-zone basis; if at all, it may exist on a per-registrar
basis at best. (Our data counts over 2, 000 registrars).
Re-Registrations by Prior Age: As a ﬁrst step to-
ward predicting which expired domains are more likely
to be re-registered than others, we break down the sur-
vival function for com by the age of the domain before
it expired. Figure 4 illustrates that domains that were
previously registered for longer time spans are more
likely to be re-registered than short-lived domains. A
prior registration period of nine or more years, for in-
stance, makes a domain about three times more likely
to be re-registered than a domain that was not renewed
after its initial year. Longer prior registration periods
may indicate that such a domain was more desirable
to keep, and it may have established a good online
reputation that could be valuable not only to regular
businesses or Internet users looking to establish a pres-
ence under a newly available, coveted name, but also
to spammers [13] or other miscreants aiming to exploit
residual trust [15, 17], and more generally to domain
speculators hoping to resell for a proﬁt, or to monetise
the domain not with content, but advertising [18]. Note
however that age does not necessarily mean popularity;
fewer than 200 domains in our sample appear on lists
of popular Internet hosts such as the Alexa Top 1 M.
5. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
When we initially set out to quantify re-registration
probabilities and delays, we expected this to be a relat-
ively straight-forward measurement task, with Whois
data collection at scale being the biggest anticipated
challenge. As we found out, however, domain names
can and do expire in various diﬀerent ways that are not
fully explored in relevant literature; variations in how
sponsoring registrars implement expiration ﬂows make
it challenging to predict the time between expiration
date and deletion. Furthermore, some domain states are
not visible in Whois data, and it is easy to draw incor-

smaller fraction of re-registrations.
the censored part of our data, the set of non-registration
time spans (i.e., expiration date until the most recent
“domain not found” Whois observation). Our survival
analysis is based on observed re-registrations of over
1 M domains in ﬁve zones, and almost 5.5 M domains
not re-registered during the measurement (Table 2).
Overall Re-Registration Delay: Figure 3 shows
the survival functions for the ﬁve zones. Those with a
smaller size (see Table 1) also exhibit a smaller rate of
re-registrations for expired domains. The most popu-
lar zone, com, has a re-registration rate of about 20 %
after 300 days. An interesting observation is that on
our time scale, domains that are re-registered tend to
be re-registered early. All zones exhibit a spike of re-
registrations just before day 80; for com, days 0 – 80
see about as many re-registrations as days 80 – 350.
Eighty days correspond to the maximum deletion delay
after expiration (45 days in auto-renew, 30 in redemp-
tion period and 5 in pending delete). Therefore, we
hypothesise that these re-registrations illustrate regis-
trants taking over expired domains as soon as possible.
Earliest Re-Registrations: Immediate re-registra-
tion of deleted domains is the core business of so-called
drop-catch services. For a fee, they attempt to “catch”
a domain automatically as soon as it “drops.” Being
fully automated, and with multiple companies in direct
competition, we assume that domain registrations by
drop-catch services happen as early as possible, and we
can use those registrations to gain better insights into
the expiration behaviour of domains.
Many online explanations of domain expiration beha-
viour would mislead the reader into believing that the
delay is always 80 days after the expiration date. How-
ever, the steepest increase in re-registrations we observe
in our data is on days 78 and 79. The reason is that
the auto-renew grace period has a maximum duration
of 45 days, after which the registrar becomes liable for
a year’s worth of domain renewal fees. To avoid the fee,
registrars can delete a domain at any point during the
45 days, and they appear to do so a few days early.

rect conclusions from a single observation. For instance,
a domain with an expiration date months ahead may
very well cease to exist a few weeks after the observation
due to domain tasting or a retroactively canceled auto-
matic renewal. These very common patterns can cause
statistics about the remaining lifetime of domains to be
overestimated, or make a distribution showing the age
of registered domains in a zone include domains that,
strictly speaking, do not exist at observation time.
Ambiguities in Whois responses make the data dif-
ﬁcult to work with not only in large-scale studies like
ours, but also for manual, one-time investigations. We
believe that any successor to the Whois protocol should
aim to enforce a well-deﬁned, common format that is
consistently used across registries and registrars, and
make domain states more explicit. A public audit trail
of domain state modiﬁcations, for instance, could satisfy
this requirement and would also better support invest-
igations of past (mis)behaviour of domains.
