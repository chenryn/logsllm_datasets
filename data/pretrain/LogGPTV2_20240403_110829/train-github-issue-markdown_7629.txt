## Feature Request

### Description
When `optimization.sideEffects` is set to `true`, the code will not be analyzed for side effects during the production build. However, the `sideEffects` field in `package.json` will still be considered.

### Expected Behavior
When `optimization.sideEffects` is `true` and the build is in production mode, the `sideEffects` field in `package.json` should be ignored. Conversely, if `optimization.sideEffects` is `true` but the build is not in production mode, the `sideEffects` field in `package.json` should still be used.

### Motivation or Use Case
This change would provide more control over how side effects are handled in different build modes, ensuring that developers can fine-tune their builds for optimal performance and behavior. For a detailed example, see the following configuration:
- [GitHub Example](https://github.com/galaxy-s10/issue-demo/blob/master/demo1/webpack.config.js)

### Implementation Suggestions
- Introduce a conditional check in the build process to determine whether to use the `sideEffects` field in `package.json` based on the values of `optimization.sideEffects` and the build mode.
- Update the documentation to clearly explain the new behavior and its implications.

### Willingness to Contribute
Are you willing to work on this yourself? If so, please indicate your availability and any additional support you may need.
