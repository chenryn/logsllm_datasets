## Feature request
When optimization.sideEffects is set to true, the code will not be analyzed
for side effects during production mode construction，  
The sideEffects field in package.json will still be used  
Whether sideEffects in package.json should be ignored when
optimization.sideEffects is true and in production mode
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Whether sideEffects in package.json should be ignored when

**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**
