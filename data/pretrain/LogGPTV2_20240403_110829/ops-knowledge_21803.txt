User: How to find and delete files with specified suffix in Linux system by writing a script in Python?
Assistant: You can use Python's os and os.path modules to find and delete files with specified extensions in the Linux system. The following is a sample script: ```python import os # The suffix to be found and deleted suffix = '.log' # Traverse all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories for root, dirs, files in os.walk(' /path/to/directory'): for file in files: # If the file name ends with the specified suffix if file.endswith(suffix): #Construct the full path filepath = os.path.join(root, file) #Delete the file os.remove(filepath) ``` In the above example, the suffix to be searched and deleted can be specified by modifying the value of the suffix variable, and the directory to be traversed can be specified by modifying the parameters of the os.walk function. It should be noted that deleting files in the Linux system requires corresponding permissions, otherwise an exception of insufficient permissions will be thrown. If you want to delete multiple files, you can use a try-except statement to catch the exception and continue the script.
