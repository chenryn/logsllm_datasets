 **Context:**
  * Playwright Version: 1.27.1
  * Operating System: Linux and Mac
  * Node.js version: v16.17.0
    import {test, expect, Page} from '@playwright/test';
    test.describe("Sample test", () => {
      let page: Page
      test.beforeAll(async ({ browser }) => {
        page = await browser.newPage()
      })
      test.afterAll(async () => {
        await page.close()
      })
      test('homepage has Playwright in title and get started link linking to the intro page', async () => {
        await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
        await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwrights/);
      })
    })
**Describe the bug**
such code ( note "shared" `page` used as mentioned here ) doesn't create a
video ( also on failure ) - `video: 'retain-on-failure'` / `video: 'on'`
doesn't create a file
A shorter code (below) works well
    import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
    test.describe("Sample test", () => {
      test('homepage has Playwright in title and get started link linking to the intro page', async ({page}) => {
        await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
        await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwrights/);
      })
    })
