### Title: Black Hat US-22: Backdooring and Hijacking Azure AD Accounts by Abusing External Identities

External identities in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) enable collaboration with users outside of an organization. These external users, often referred to as guest users, can be granted access to specific resources and work alongside internal users. Their identities are typically managed in a different Azure AD tenant or are unmanaged accounts outside of Azure AD.

This presentation delves into the functionality of external identities in Azure AD and how concepts like B2B (Business-to-Business) collaboration are facilitated. During the research for this talk, several implementation flaws were identified that allow for novel methods of backdooring and hijacking Azure AD accounts from a regular user's perspective. Additionally, these flaws can be exploited to elevate privileges, bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and circumvent Conditional Access policies. Notably, all these attacks were possible in the default configuration of Azure AD.

The presentation will provide insights into the following areas:
1. The concept of external identities in Azure AD.
2. The technical details that enabled these attacks.
3. Strategies to harden against such attacks and detect the abuse of these vulnerabilities.

By understanding these vulnerabilities and their mitigation, organizations can better secure their Azure AD environments and protect against potential threats.
