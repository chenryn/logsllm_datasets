Table 3: Top 20 carriers used by abusive phone veriﬁed ac-
counts. Veriﬁcation challenges are predominantly sent over
VOIP or to a concentrated set of carriers in India and In-
donesia.
as $140 per 1K veriﬁcation codes for mobile (non-VOIP)
numbers originating from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.
Similarly, miscreants can acquire SIM cards in bulk. We see
resellers advertising prices of $140–420 per 1K SIM cards
for Russian carriers such as Beeline, MTS, and MegaFon.
While we can only speculate, discussions we observe on un-
derground forums suggest that workers manually respond to
veriﬁcation challenges using modiﬁed cell phones to simplify
cycling through SIM cards. This reﬂects related strategies
for CAPTCHA solving that rely on manual laborers oper-
ating out of India and Indonesia as discussed in Section 2.
4.1.3 Collocation of Phones and IP Addresses
One potential measurement of the validity of a newly reg-
istered PVA is the collocation of a phone’s country of origin
and the geolocation of the IP address a miscreant uses to
register the account. Figure 3 shows a weekly breakdown
of the six most popular IP geolocations tied to signups at a
country granularity. We ﬁnd that trends in IP geolocation
nearly mirror that of phone origins (previously presented in
Figure 2). The exception to this trend is the decreased popu-
larity of US IP addresses, which may be a direct consequence
of the diﬃculty of purchasing hosts in the US from the pay-
per-install market [5] or the respective cost of freelance labor
in the US compared to other regions. Quantitatively, 60%
of abusive accounts in our dataset share the same IP and
phone origin, while the same is true for only 33% of pur-
chased accounts. This deviation for purchased accounts is a
consequence of the majority of phone numbers coming from
the United States while IPs originate in India, a trend that
is also reﬂected in Figure 3 for abusive accounts back in
July. Our results indicate that miscreants bulk registering
PVA take care to mimic the expected behavior of legitimate
registrations beyond avoiding clustering.

The most frequent source of abusive IPs mirrors that of abu-
sive sources of phone numbers.
4.2 Lifecycle of a Phone Number
Miscreants have a multitude of strategies for how they
leverage SMS access once acquired. We measure the number
of accounts that miscreants associate with the same phone
number, estimate the duration miscreants control phone
numbers, and identify whether miscreants opt for SMS or
voice challenges.
4.2.1 Phone Reuse
Miscreants can reuse a phone number multiple times to
amortize the cost of acquiring access to a VOIP number
or SIM card. For each phone numbers in our abusive ac-
count sample we calculate the total number of all registered
accounts that share the same number, regardless if Google
disabled those accounts for abuse. We repeat this process
again for phone numbers tied to purchased accounts. To
serve as a comparison, we also obtain re-use statistics tied
to a random sample of 300,000 benign phone numbers (pro-
vided by Google). Figure 4 shows a summary of our results.
We ﬁnd that 36% of numbers associated with abusive ac-
counts are unique. This results in a skewed distribution,
where the top 10% of phone numbers (ranked by popular-
ity) are used to register 23% of accounts. A similar result
appears for numbers tied to purchased accounts where only
13% of numbers are unique and the top 10% of numbers
are used to create 25% of accounts. In total, phone clusters
of size 5 or greater contain 58% of abusive accounts. As
a result, a safeguard that restricts the number of accounts
miscreants can associate with a single phone number can
have a substantial impact on the volume of phone numbers
required to sustain PVA abuse while having little impact on
legitimate users.
4.2.2 Phone Access Lifetime
During our investigation of the underground we found that
blackmarket merchants oﬀering SMS as a service frequently
advertised a limited window of availability—clients would
receive access to a number for 30-90 days, after which that
number would no longer be accessible. We estimate the life-

When miscreants verify fraudulent PVA they can opt to
receive challenge codes via SMS or voice. We ﬁnd that 90%
of abusive accounts rely on SMS codes, while the same is
true for 85% of purchased accounts. This holds for benign
accounts as well where users verify their phone 94% via SMS.
We ﬁnd that the veriﬁcation method miscreants use is inde-
pendent of whether they rely on VOIP or mobile numbers.
The exception to this rule is PT in Indonesia; 31% of ver-
iﬁcation codes served through this carrier were conducted
over voice. This further suggests that human veriﬁers may
respond to challenges from this region, though we note that
voice transcription software is an alternative explanation.
We cannot draw any conclusion as to how SMS codes from
mobile phones are recovered, though we note that VOIP
services such as Google Voice digitize text messages that
miscreants can scrape.
4.3 Alternative Account Challenges
Phone veriﬁcation is one layer in a set of successive
challenges miscreants must pass in order to register a
new account. These other challenges include IP signals,
CAPTCHA solving, and providing a secondary email. We
brieﬂy examine how miscreants circumvent each of these
measures. When possible, we compare our results to those of
the Twitter account market examined by Thomas et al. [26]
to determine whether merchant techniques for bulk registra-
tion generalize across services.
IP Diversity
4.3.1
Miscreants rely on IP addresses from India (32%), the
United States (19%), Indonesia (11%), Vietnam (2%), and
a range of other countries to register abusive PVA. Our pur-
chased accounts were registered via IPs exclusively from In-
dia (70%) and the United States (30%). In contrast, miscre-
ants targeting Twitter relied on a much more diverse range
of countries; India, the most popular region, accounted for
only 8% of abuse [26]. We believe this diﬀerence stems di-
rectly from miscreants relying on IP addresses collocated
with phones, as previously discussed in Section 4.1.
Once miscreants have access to an IP they register tens
to hundreds of accounts from that portal. Figure 6 shows
a breakdown of IP reuse amongst abusive, purchased, and
a random sample of benign accounts. The merchants we
purchase from clearly restrict the number of accounts they
register from a single IP. Other miscreants bulk registering
accounts are not so cautious. Nevertheless, IP reuse is not
a foolproof signal; benign accounts are frequently registered
via the same IP due to NATing and mobile traﬃc.
4.3.2 CAPTCHA Solving
We ﬁnd that CAPTCHAs are a minor roadblock in the
account creation process. In total, 56% of abusive accounts
solved a CAPTCHA. Miscreants solved these CAPTCHAs
correctly 96% of the time. This accuracy is a strong indi-
cation of human solvers based on the results of Motoyama
et al. [15], though it may be possible that OCR CAPTCHA
solving has vastly improved since then. Our ﬁndings diﬀer
from Thomas et al. [26] where the majority of Twitter ac-
count merchants relied on what appeared to be automated
solvers with roughly 7% accuracy. We cannot directly mea-
sure the time it takes miscreants to solve a CAPTCHA.
However, we can estimate the overall time it takes miscre-

with the same phone number.
Figure 5: CDF of time between successive account regis-
trations sharing the same phone number.
time that miscreants control a number as the time between
its ﬁrst use to its last use within our measurement window,
restricting our analysis to numbers used at least ﬁve times.
This timestamp is determined based on the creation time of
an account. Our results are shown in Figure 5.
We ﬁnd that 62% of phone numbers tied to abusive PVA
have a lifetime of only 1 hour. Similarly, 55% of phones tied
to purchased accounts have a lifetime of only 1 hour and
76% less than a day. This indicates that once miscreants
acquire a phone number, there is a high velocity period of
abuse, after which the phone number is never used again.
Consequently, blacklisting an individual phone number upon
an abuse report is ineﬀective at preventing future abuse if
the delay between an account’s creation and deactivation is
greater than a day.
Defenders can leverage this short lifetime to their advan-
tage. Miscreants that purchase accounts from the under-
ground have no means to re-verify access to a phone number
once the account transfers hands. Similarly, merchants that
bulk generate thousands of accounts would need to catalog
and retain the VOIP number or SIM card used to verify each
account, something that may be impossible. We explore how
services can perform re-veriﬁcation without increasing fric-
tion on legitimate users further in Section 6.

Table 4: Top 5 email providers used as recovery addresses
for abusive PVA.
Of the accounts we purchase, 29% are stale accounts regis-
tered back in mid-October, 2013 while the remaining 71%
are fresh accounts created in mid-April, 2014. We discuss
the implications each set has on our understanding of the
account blackmarket and abusive phone veriﬁcation.
Stale Accounts: Merchants providing stale PVA are still
liquidating stockpiles they generated during the period of
rampant VOIP abuse. All of the accounts in this set were
phone veriﬁed via Bandwidth.com, re-aﬃrming our ﬁndings
presented in Section 4.1. Even though old stockpiles are reg-
ularly disabled (discussed in Section 3), we ﬁnd that mer-
chants are still able to retain some operational credentials.
The presence of such accounts also suggests a lack of liquid-
ity in the market; merchants have held on to accounts for 6
months without sale. One potential explanation is consumer
skepticism on the merchant’s credibility or the exorbitant
fees they charge.
Fresh Accounts: Merchants providing fresh PVA have
adapted to the new phone veriﬁcation requirements imposed
by Google. Of fresh accounts, only 12% were veriﬁed via
Bandwidth.com—an evolution we see mirrored at the end
of our analysis in April. Instead, merchants verify 74% of
PVA with a previously unobserved US carrier that is likely a
VOIP provider and 9% from a carrier related to TextMe (an
Android and iOS VOIP app) which we previously observed.
Our results highlight the resilience of the underground to
intervention. Nevertheless, we believe that if services force
merchants away from VOIP it will in turn raise the opera-
tional costs of miscreants and ultimately cut into the prof-
itability of spam and abuse.
Noticeably absent in our fresh account sample are any
phones tied to carriers in India or Indonesia as we see in our
abusive dataset. This may reﬂect a limitation in our cover-
age of the underground market or alternatively indicate that
some spammers are vertically integrated and beyond our ac-
cess. As such, while we believe that underground inﬁltration
provides an invaluable oracle into the performance of abuse
safeguards, it should be supplemented with service-side data
to provide a dual perspective on abuse.
6. ADAPTING PHONE VERIFICATION
We distill our underground market analysis of PVA abuse
into a set of recommendations and best practices for services
reliant on phone veriﬁcation. While our perspective of PVA
abuse is limited to Google, we believe the threats we iden-
tify are fundamental to phone veriﬁcation and thus apply
outside its conﬁnes. We also take a moment to discuss open
challenges for phone veriﬁcation services moving forward in-
cluding resource exhaustion attacks and the potential for
compromised phones.
Figure 6: Reuse of IP addresses for registering accounts.
Secondary Email Address
ants to register a new account. We ﬁnd it takes a median of
1.86 minutes from the time Google displays a signup form to
the time miscreants submit a response. In contrast, benign
registrations take a median of 3.36 minutes. This overall
timing yields little signal into the abusiveness of a newly
minted account.
It is likely miscreants purposefully delay
their automation speeds to avoid rudimentary timing detec-
tion.
4.3.3
Google allows new accounts to associate a secondary email
for recovery purposes. While not required, we ﬁnd that 83%
of purchased accounts and 34% of abusive accounts provide
a secondary email. A breakdown of the most popular email
providers tied to abusive accounts is shown in Table 4. We
observe that 52% of abusive PVA list a second Gmail address
as a recovery email. For purchased accounts (not shown in
the Table), 57% use a secondary Gmail address. The remain-
ing 43% of accounts use Hotmail.com, one of the cheapest
emails on the underground that we observe merchants sell-
ing for $5 per 1K. Apart from an increased prevalence of
Gmail addresses, the most popular email providers are iden-
tical to those abused by Twitter account merchants with the
exception of rediﬀmail.com [26].
The frequency of Gmail recovery addresses amongst bulk
generated accounts is a result of email chaining where mis-
creants specify a recovery address tied to a previously gen-
erated account they control. We build a graph of all email-
secondary email pairs and ﬁnd that 95% of accounts we
purchased share a link with another purchased accounts.
Miscreants form chains that are 2–4 accounts long before
forming a cycle with the start of the chain. We note that
forming a cycle is possible because secondary addresses are
not validated on signup. This practice removes any cost as-
sociated with merchants purchasing secondary emails while
providing a credible veneer in the event recovery emails are
factored into spam analysis.
5. REVISITING THE UNDERGROUND
Following the conclusion of our market and abuse mon-
itoring in April, 2014, we revisit the underground mer-
chants we originally solicited to procure a fresh set of 2,478
Google PVA. We use these accounts to independently verify
the long-term impact of Google’s penalization of frequently
abused carriers in January, 2014 (discussed in Section 4.1).

The long term validity of phone veriﬁcation hinges on ser-
vices enforcing the scarcity of phone numbers as an under-
ground resource. To satisfy this requirement, we propose
two solutions: a carrier reputation system which tracks the
most frequently abused telephony providers at a coarse level
and phone reputation that provides ﬁne-grained abuse in-
formation related to phone numbers, similar to existing IP,
domain, and social reputation systems [1, 12, 13, 28].
6.1.1 Carrier Reputation
As our analysis shows, account merchants gravitate to-
wards free or inexpensive regional telephony carriers for the
bulk of their phone numbers. If we examine the aggregate
contributions of carriers ranked by popularity–shown in Fig-
ure 7–we ﬁnd miscreants verify 20% of all abusive PVA from
a single carrier and 50% of PVA from the top 10 carriers.
Blacklisting carriers outright (with the exception of VOIP)
is not an option. Table 5 shows a breakdown of the top 10
carriers tied to PVA abuse and the fraction of all accounts
veriﬁed via those carriers that are considered legitimate by
Google (e.g. not disabled). Only Bandwidth.com, the VOIP
provider we saw aﬃliated with rampant abuse, has a low rep-
utation. All other carriers are popular amongst legitimate
users.
An alternative to blacklisting is to adaptively throttle
the number of accounts that can be tied to a single phone
number on a per-carrier basis. While there are legitimate
users who rely on re-using phone numbers (discussed in Sec-
tion 4.2), phone veriﬁcation services can strike a balance
between user friction and abuse prevention. In particular,
services can restrict phones tied to frequently abused carriers
to a one-to-one mapping between accounts and phone num-
bers, forcing miscreants to acquire more numbers. Other
carriers would default to a many-to-one allowance. Carrier
reputation scores can also be considered as a factor into ma-
chine learning risk evaluations tied to new registrations.
This same system can outright block mobile and VOIP
services (if appropriate) when the threshold of abusive ac-
counts drops below an acceptable level. While miscreants
may spread their veriﬁcation endpoints over multiple carri-
ers, this forces criminals to pay higher fees. Craigslist has
taken a similar policy to the extreme, blacklisting all VOIP
and non-US numbers as veriﬁcation endpoints [6]. This
strategy has kept Craigslist PVA at a price of $3.50–$5 per
account (as advertised by account merchants), though it pre-
cludes a global user bases. Carrier reputation services cur-
