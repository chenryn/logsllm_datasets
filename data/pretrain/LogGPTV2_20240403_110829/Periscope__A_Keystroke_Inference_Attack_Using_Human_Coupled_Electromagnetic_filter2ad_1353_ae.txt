tim‚Äôs inputs on soft keyboards. An intuitive defense solution is thus
to adopt shuffled keyboards. This idea has been proposed before
[44]; the system adopts a new randomly generated keyboard layout
each time a user intends to enter a credential. Although attackers
can still derive finger movement traces, they can be hardly mapped
to specific keystrokes without the knowledge of keyboard layout.
While leaving the key inference almost impossible, as pointed by
[60], this idea sacrifices the authentication usability. Extra effort is
incurred to the user in searching for keys on a shuffled keyboard.
More input errors might also be introduced thereby.
In a more practical way, users may intentionally disrupt their
typing behaviors, for instance, adding random pauses between
keystrokes and/or adopting variant typing speeds when entering
different key pairs. For both cases, attackers will tend to make
mistakes in transforming time-dependent finger-screen distances
to 3D finger movement traces. For the former, the trace length
will appear much longer than the ground truth. For the latter, as
a user adopts a dynamic speed, it is impossible for an attacker to
generate a meaningful finger movement trace with ùë£ùëù, a constant
finger movement speed that is estimated in advance the attack. As
a result, the derived ùêøùë• and ùêøùë¶ become error-prone in both cases.
The attacker is less likely to accurately recover individual key pairs,
let alone the whole PIN.

shielding on touchscreens. This technique has been widely em-
ployed on many electronic devices; it refers to the shielding of
radio waves so that radiations cannot penetrate the shield. In our
case, it can serve as a barrier that prevents EM emanation leak-
age, or at least reduces the radiation strength. Nonetheless, this
approach may be expensive and require hardware modifications,
including the introduction of new EMI materials and touchscreen
circuit redesign. Another alternative is to intentionally obfuscate
the EM emanations emitted by the touchscreen, so that the tra-
jectories of EM readings are not recognizable. A straightforward
approach is to add well-calibrated noise to the touchscreen driving
signal ùëâùëá ùëã (ùë°). Then attacker‚Äôs EM measurements ùëâùëö(ùë°) become
polluted. Since the attacker is unaware of the injected noise pattern,
it is hard to tell if observed EM variations are incurred by finger
movements or intentionally injected noise.
10 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present Periscope, a new eavesdropping attack that
leverages human-coupled EM emanations from touchscreens to
infer victims‚Äô typing inputs at a remote distance. We implemented
the proposed attack with a prototype that costs less than $10. Its
effectiveness is evaluated from various aspects. Periscope exhibits
promising recovery accuracy over a distance up to 90 cm. It can well
adapt to diverse device models and setting contexts. Compared with
prior works, our approach is built on an analytic model that charac-
terizes the relationship between EM measurements and finger move-
ment traces. Therefore, it avoids the collection of large amounts
of labeled data samples in advance of the attack. In summary, we
believe that Periscope outperforms state-of-the-art keystroke infer-
ence attacks, especially in terms of practicality. Meanwhile, it can
be further extended with longer attack distance and inference over
letter inputs, which are deemed as our future work.
