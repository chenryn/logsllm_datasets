I am currently attempting to get one of the more efficient source map options to work correctly. When I use any `source-map`-oriented devtool setting, and I try to set a breakpoint in Chrome 48.0.2564.82, the debugger jumps to a different line than the one I selected.

Furthermore, when I use `eval-source-map`, not only does the line number jump occur, but the breakpoint never triggers, even on the line it jumped to. 

Could you please provide some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
