I am trying for the life of me to get one of the more efficient source map
option working.
When I use any `source-map` oriented devtool setting, if I try and set a
breakpoint in Chrome 48.0.2564.82, it jumps to a different line that what I
selected.
If I use `eval-source-map` not only do I get the line number jump, but I also
never get a break point stop even on the line it jumped to.
