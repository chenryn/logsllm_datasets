When you pass doctrine proxy object to twig render function e.g.
    {{ render(controller('ExampleBundle:Example:index', {'item', md.item})) }}
where "md" is entity with property "item" that represent object of many to one
relationship, render function converts proxy object to array and "indexAction"
of "ExampleController" gets that array instead of proxy object and you lose
all access to getters and setters.
