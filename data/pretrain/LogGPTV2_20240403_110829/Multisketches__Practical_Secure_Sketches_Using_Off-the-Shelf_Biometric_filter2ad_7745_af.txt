to protect biometrics is using secure sketches and fuzzy extractors,
which was first introduced by Dodis et al. [29]. Secure sketches can
be used to recover a fingerprint provided during enrollment using
a helper string (which is generated during enrollment) and a small
variant of the original fingerprint. Fuzzy extractors, similar to secure
sketches, allow extracting reliable random bits from noisy biometric
data. Though such cryptographic techniques were seminal, they
require redesigning biometric matching algorithms, often at the cost
of accuracy. Prior research has looked into designing such matching
algorithms (or distance functions) for fingerprints [52], iris [36,
63], and face [57]. However, such custom matching algorithms
invariably degrade the matching performance and make it unusable
in practice [32]. Therefore, to date fingerprints are not protected
beyond encrypting them at rest and decrypting during matching.
In mobile devices, often dedicated hardware is used to protect the
fingerprint. See [38, 51] for a detailed discussion on the gap between
theory and practice in this research area.
We propose a new template protection technique, what we call
multisketch. A Multisketch system works with any matching algo-
rithm and therefore removes the decades long problem that pre-
vented template protection algorithms from being used in practice.
The main drawback of multisketch, however, is that it requires mul-
tiple biometric features — which can be from different modalities
— to be recorded for each individual and a large (e.g., thousands)
number of users to provide meaningful security. Both of these re-
quirements are met in current large-scale biometric databases used
in practice [3, 11].
Our multisketch construction is conceptually similar to the set-
distance secure sketch construction of Juels and Sudan [39], which
conceals valid set elements using fake “chaff” ones. In our construc-
tion, however, the real set elements of other users are the “chaff.”
Additionally, Jules et al. [39] assume exact matching between a
conjectured and valid set of elements during decoding, while we
introduce the idea of approximate matching via biometric matching
algorithms. Approximate matching passphrases were also proposed
by Bard [15] by allowing a user to log in with small typographical
mistakes. Bard proposed using a fixed dictionary of words care-
fully constructed so that no two words in the dictionary are closer
than edit distance two; the user has to pick a passphrase consisting
of words from this dictionary. Multisketch works without such a
constraint and a dictionary.
Last but not least, we emphasize that secure multi-party computa-
tion (sMPC) and secure function evaluation (SFE) protocols [16, 23,
62] are complementary to multisketches, not alternatives. Templates
and proffered biometrics in a multisketch system could, for instance,
be (k, n)-secret-shared among n distinct servers and matching is
performed using MPC. In this case, an attacker would need to com-
promise at least k servers in order to obtain the underlying database
and start to attack the multisketch system.
Unfortunately, though, such use of MPC would be prohibitively
expensive. Existing literature thus instead treats the different and
simpler task of using SFE for privacy-preserving queries, i.e., so that
when a user makes a biometric matching query, no information
about the query is revealed to the server, and no information about
the database is revealed to the client — unless a successful match
occurs. SCiFI [53] accomplishes this goal for face recognition, but
requires 0.3 second per matching operation — or more than three
days for a database with one million users. The harder task of
MPC-based fingerprint matching would clearly not scale to large
databases. In contrast, multisketches provide strong protection
against biometric database breaches with a practical computational
cost.
9 CONCLUSION
Biometric template protection is a long-elusive goal for decades. As
large-scale biometric databases are being built across the globe and
are being adopted more widely as a mode of authentication, such
databases would be a lucrative target for attackers. Breaches of
such databases will compromise the biometric identities of millions,
and even billions of users.
We introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called multisketch,
to protect large scale biometric databases. Multisketch works with
multiple biometrics, even with different modalities, and can oper-
ate with any underlying biometric matching algorithm — a key
difference with prior template protection techniques. To protect
the stored templates from a breach of the database, multisketch
removes the association between the identity of the user and their
biometrics, and stores them in random order. Only when a user
provides a set of biometrics that is nearly as correct as the originally
given ones, the templates of the user can be recovered. Multisketch
can be used for verification, as well as for generating high entropy
keys.
We detail the design a multisketch for tenprints, which we call
TenSketch. We prototype TenSketch using tenprint dataset released
by NIST. Using Bozorth3 matching algorithm, we show the feasibil-
ity of TenSketch for real-world deployment. The computational and
matching performance can be improved by using different, more
advanced matching algorithms, and by updating (if necessary) the
template information stored in the database. This changes can be
done with the least overhead. Such biometric agility is one of the
key benefits of a multisketch system.
We explore the correlation between different fingerprints of a
user using advanced machine learning techniques. We build classi-
fiers to identify fingerprints from the same user. Using the classifier
we propose possible attacks and simulate their efficacies. We finally
show that even in a conservative setting, the attacker’s benefit is
marginal, and TenSketch provides equivalent of at least 58-bits
of security from a database of 2, 500 individuals. Database with
more users would be more secure for TenSketch. Synthetic finger-
prints [20] can be used to improve security, though more investiga-
tion is required to understand how easy it is to distinguish synthetic
fingerprints from the real ones.
Multisketch built on multi-modal biometrics are expected to be
more secure. Though, more investigation on the correlation among
fingerprints and other biometrics of different modalities will help
better estimate security of multisketch in practice. Also, building
techniques to de-correlate fingerprints will improve the security of
multisketches.
