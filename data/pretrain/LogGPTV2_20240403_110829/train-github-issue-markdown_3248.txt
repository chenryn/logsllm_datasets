### Issue Description

After upgrading to Material-UI 1.0.0-beta.18, I am unable to build the code. The error message is as follows:

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that `TransitionProps` uses `children` with the type `React.ReactElement`, while `CollapseProps` uses a different type, `React.ReactNode`. Could this discrepancy be causing the issue?

### Environment

- **Material-UI**: 1.0.0-beta.18
- **React**: 16.0.0

### Additional Information

I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
