### A. Gather Evidence/Screenshots
### C. Create Final Deliverable

#### Objective:
To ensure that the final deliverable is written in a way that non-technical readers can easily understand, while also providing detailed recommendations to address the identified issues. This is a critical aspect of what clients pay for.

#### What Makes This Book Different from Other Penetration Testing Books?
When you look at the table of contents, you might notice the absence of topics commonly covered in other penetration testing books, such as social engineering, evading antivirus software, wireless hacking, mobile and web application testing, and lock picking. These topics are indeed important, but they each deserve their own comprehensive coverage. Covering them superficially in a single chapter would not do justice to the depth of information available on each one.

The primary goal of this book is to equip you with the essential tools and knowledge needed to conduct a typical internal network penetration test (INTP). This type of engagement is a standard service offered by most penetration testing firms and is the most common type of assessment you will perform if you pursue a career as a professional penetration tester.

During a typical INTP, which will occupy at least 80% of your time, you will not be asked or allowed to interact with the client's wireless infrastructure, send phishing emails, or attempt physical access to data centers. You also won't have the time or resources to develop custom payloads to bypass specific EDR solutions. Instead of skimming over these interesting but less relevant topics, this book focuses solely on the core aspects of internal network penetration testing.

### 1.6.1 Building Your Own Virtual Pentest Platform

The Capsulecorp Pentest environment is a virtual network set up using VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Ansible. It includes vulnerable enterprise systems and a preconfigured Ubuntu Linux system for use as your attacking machine. To get started, download the repository from the bookâ€™s website (https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-network-penetration-testing) or GitHub (https://github.com/r3dy/capsulecorp-pentest) and follow the setup documentation before proceeding to the next chapter.

### 1.7 Building Your Own Virtual Pentest Platform

Some readers may prefer to build their own setup from scratch. If you choose this path, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind when selecting an operating system platform.

#### 1.7.1 Begin with Linux

Like many professional penetration testers, I recommend using the Linux operating system for conducting the technical portions of an engagement. This preference is driven by a "chicken and egg" phenomenon. Most penetration testers use Linux, and when they develop tools, they share them with the community, usually via platforms like GitHub. These tools are often developed and optimized for Linux, making them easier to use and more reliable on this platform. Consequently, more people adopt Linux for penetration testing to access the latest and best tools.

There are additional reasons for this preference. Until the introduction of Microsoft's PowerShell, Linux/UNIX-based systems were the only ones that natively supported programming and scripting automated workflows. Writing and running code in Linux is straightforward, requiring only a text editor like Vim or Vi. This ease of automation is crucial for penetration testers, who, like developers, aim to avoid repetitive tasks by writing scripts.

Moreover, many pentesters identify as hackers, and traditionally, hackers favor open-source software. Open-source software allows for free customization and transparency, which aligns with the hacker ethos of information freedom and skepticism towards closed-source commercial applications.

**Tip:** Linux is the preferred operating system for most penetration testers. Many powerful tools are developed and optimized for Linux, so it is highly recommended for anyone serious about penetration testing.

#### 1.7.2 The Ubuntu Project

My personal preference is Ubuntu Linux, a derivative of Debian Linux. I find Ubuntu to be the best-performing platform among the various distributions I have tested. While I encourage you to choose a distribution you are comfortable with, I strongly recommend one that is well-documented and supported by a large community. Ubuntu meets and exceeds these criteria.

Choosing a Linux distribution is similar to choosing a programming language. There are passionate supporters for each distribution, but the best choice is often the one you know best and can be most productive with.

#### 1.7.3 Why Not Use a Pentest Distribution?

You may have heard of Kali Linux, Black Arch, or other custom Linux distributions designed for penetration testing. While these distributions offer a convenient, pre-configured environment, they can be bloated with unnecessary tools. In my experience, these pre-configured platforms often include tools that are rarely used, making them less efficient.

Additionally, during engagements, you may encounter situations where a tool works on Ubuntu but not on Kali, even though Kali is based on Ubuntu. This can lead to additional troubleshooting. For these reasons, I prefer to run Ubuntu and install only the tools I need.

**Note:** If you still prefer to use Kali, that is perfectly fine. Most of the tools covered in this book are available in Kali Linux. However, all exercises and demonstrations in the book are performed using a custom-built Ubuntu machine. You can follow along with Kali, but you may need to adapt some steps.

If you decide to build your own system, refer to Appendix A for a complete setup and configuration guide. Alternatively, you can download and set up the Capsulecorp Pentest environment from the GitHub link provided in section 1.6.1. Once your lab environment is ready, you can begin conducting your first penetration test in Chapter 2.

### Summary

- **The World We Live In:** Our world is increasingly dependent on networked computer systems.
- **Security Challenges:** Companies face significant challenges in managing the security of their systems.
- **Penetration Testing:** Adversarial attack simulations, or penetration tests, help identify and mitigate security weaknesses before they can be exploited.
- **Internal Network Penetration Test (INPT):** The most common type of penetration test simulates threats from within the organization.
- **Phases of INPT:**
  1. Information Gathering
  2. Focused Penetration
  3. Post-Exploitation and Privilege Escalation
  4. Documentation

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

This part of the book will guide you through the first phase of an internal network penetration test (INPT). In Chapter 2, you will learn how to identify live hosts from a given IP address range using various techniques and tools. Chapter 3 covers further enumeration by identifying network services and fingerprinting them. Finally, in Chapter 4, you will perform manual vulnerability discovery, focusing on authentication, configuration, and patching vulnerabilities. By the end of this phase, you will have a comprehensive understanding of your target environment's attack surface, preparing you for the next phase: focused penetration.

### 2.1 Understanding Your Engagement Scope

At this point, you might be wondering how the list of IP address ranges for host discovery is determined. This happens during scoping discussions, which typically occur during the sales process. As a consultant, you may not be involved in these discussions, but it is crucial to be familiar with the scope of the engagement.

#### 2.1.1 Black-Box, White-Box, and Grey-Box Scoping

Clients can approach scoping in different ways:

- **White-Box Scoping:** The client provides a list of individual IP addresses to be considered in scope.
- **Black-Box Scoping:** The client gives no information, assuming you are an external attacker who has gained access and must now footprint the network.
- **Grey-Box Scoping:** The client provides a list of IP address ranges for you to sweep and identify targets.

**Definition:** Footprinting is the process of enumerating information about the target network.

### 2.2 Host Discovery

#### Workflow
1. **Send Discovery Probes:** Identify live hosts within the given IP address ranges.
2. **Client Approval:** Confirm with the client if any identified hosts are off-limits.
3. **Create Target List:** Place approved targets in `targets.txt` and unapproved targets in `ignore.txt`.

By following these steps, you will be well-prepared to conduct a thorough and effective internal network penetration test.
