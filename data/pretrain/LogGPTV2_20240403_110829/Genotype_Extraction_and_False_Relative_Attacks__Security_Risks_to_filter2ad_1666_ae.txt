pathological kits that match all GDFs in the genetic database.
C. Generalizability of Attacks
This work focused on a security analysis of GEDmatch,
but an important question is how these results might generalize
to other genetic genealogy services. GEDmatch is somewhat
unique because of its size (largest third-party genetic geneal-
ogy service), the breadth of its API, and its prominent use in
criminal forensics. However, many of the features, like relative
matching, chromosome visualizations and segment coordinates
in results, and raw GDF uploads are common among third-
party and DTC services.
The other most signiﬁcant third-party genetic genealogy
service is an academic research effort called DNA.Land3,
which maintains a genetic database with over 160,000
GDFs [38]. Similar to GEDmatch, DNA.Land supports relative
matching that returns chromosome visualizations and precise
matching segment coordinates [11]. However, DNA.Land has
a much more restrictive API than GEDmatch, which we
suspect makes marker extraction attacks much more difﬁcult
in practice.
DNA.Land does not support direct comparisons between
arbitrary kits, so it is more difﬁcult to target speciﬁc users, and
the resolution of the chromosome visualizations is much lower,
which obfuscates SNP level details. The matching coordinates
appear to be high resolution, so single SNP extraction (like
that shown in Section VII) may still be possible. However,
DNA.Land does signiﬁcant preprocessing of each kit before
analysis, including imputation, and uses a different matching
technique based on the GERMLINE algorithm, which further
complicates these attacks [20], [38]. Thus, we think the risk
from marker extraction is much less severe on DNA.Land
because of its signiﬁcantly restricted API compared to GED-
match and different algorithms used in comparisons.
Without DTC-authentication, it will be difﬁcult to prevent
false relative GDFs from being uploaded to any service as long
as the attacker has access to a target’s genetic sample or GDF.
Therefore, an adversary should still capable of uploading false
relatives to DNA.Land. However, this attack is much more
severe on GEDmatch than DNA.Land because the attacker can

ﬁrst extract the target’s genotype, and thus, target anyone in the
database. It may also be possible that vulnerabilities in another
service, like GEDmatch, could help bootstrap relative spooﬁng
attacks on DNA.Land because the attacker could gather more
information about the target, like the underlying genotype,
using the vulnerabilities in the other service.
To summarize, while we did not experiment with
DNA.land, we believe the more restrictive API and algorithmic
differences makes DNA.Land signiﬁcantly less vulnerable to
the security issues raised in this paper. Further, if security
issues were to manifest, they would be much harder to target
and scale. This highlights how variations in APIs and other
design choices can lead to signiﬁcant differences in security,
but that improved security may come at the cost of reduced
functionality to users. Further, we suspect that feature-rich
APIs provide value to the genetic genealogy community, and
might contribute in part to GEDmatch’s popularity. Hence,
should new services emerge, we conjecture that they may face
security challenges if they also provide broad APIs that appear
favored by customers.
X. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored new threats to genetic genealogy
beyond identity inference attacks. As this work demonstrates,
genetic genealogy services can be difﬁcult to secure because of
their open nature and the rich set of features they support. We
hope this contributes to a discussion in the computer security
and broader genetics community about emerging security risks
to genetic genealogy services and spurs future research on the
secure design of genetic genealogy systems, especially as these
services continue to be used in high-stakes applications, like
criminal forensics.

APPENDIX A
REVERSE ENGINEERING ONE-TO-ONE COMPARISONS
We began our investigation of one-to-one comparisons by
running a comparison between two kits. See Table I for a
description of the kits we used during experimentation.
To construct
these two kits, which we denote as
match(1)-kit and match(2)-kit, we copied short runs
of SNPs of varying lengths (ranging from 25 to 10,000 SNPs)
from match(1)-kit and replaced them in match(2)-kit
to simulate small matching DNA segments. In some cases, we
copied just one base from each SNP to replicate half-matches;
other times, we copied both bases to replicate full-matches
(recall that each SNP has two bases, one from each parent).
A. Interpreting the Marker Indication Bar: Filtering SNPs
To better understand the relationship between SNPs and
the 22 marker indication bars, we uploaded a third kit, called
marker-ind-kit, and ran an additional one-to-one com-
parison at full resolution between marker-ind-kit and
itself. (GEDmatch allows a kit to be compared to itself.) As
anticipated, this returned 22 marker indication bars that were
all green pixels — at every SNP, you are comparing the same
DNA bases because marker-ind-kit is being compared
to itself. Below the colored bars for chromosomes 1, 2, 3,
2”. For each
and 6, it was printed: “Image Size Reduction: 1
chromosome, the number of pixels in the marker indication
bar was substantially less than the number of SNPs.
We used the GEDmatch “DNA ﬁle diagnostic utility” to get
additional details about the marker-ind-kit. Most impor-
tantly, this utility reports the number of “Tokens” per chro-
mosome. The number of marker indication pixels, henceforth
referred to simply as pixels, for each chromosome matched the
number of tokens exactly — the exceptions were chromosomes
1, 2, 3, and 6, which had twice as many tokens as pixels (to
account for the 1/2 image size reduction). This suggested that
after a kit is uploaded to GEDmatch, certain SNPs are removed

comparisons.
Screenshot of GEDmatch’s web form for one-to-one autosomal
when a kit is tokenized (a procedure that happens soon after
uploading a kit). Furthermore, it indicates that each token
has a one-to-one correspondence with each marker indication
pixel; therefore, each tokenized SNP is compared individually
between the two kits.
Our investigation of public discussions on GEDmatch led
us to an online blog post suggesting that GEDmatch might
discard SNPs with a low MAF [26]. To test this hypothesis,
we used allele frequency data from the 1000 Genomes project
to ﬁlter out SNPs in marker-ind-kit with a MAF of less
than 1% and re-uploaded this kit to GEDmatch. We call this
new kit filtered-kit. After ﬁltering, the percent of SNPs
missing dropped precipitously from 19.3% to 2.1%. Therefore,
GEDmatch seems to be ﬁltering out many SNPs with a low
MAF in one-to-one comparisons.
B. Additional Comparison Details
This describes additional experiments that were necessary
to fully understand GEDmatch’s one-to-one comparisons.
•
Only SNPs which are present in both of the kits are
compared. We also hypothesized that only SNPs that
are present in both kits will be used in a comparison.
To test this we uploaded two kits overlap(1)-kit
and overlap(2)-kit that were
to
