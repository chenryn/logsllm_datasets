User: What is a good and easy way to distribute a web application and server bundled together, python way?
So I can say to a user "Here take this tar/whatever, unpack it and run blahblah.py" and blahblah.py will run a http/wsgi server and serve my application?
Im looking for a stable production-ready multi-threaded wsgi-server with which I can bundle my app, without the need for nginx or other "frontends" or having to deal with any configuration.
Assistant: cherrypy is the easiest one to use, django is feature rich and tornado is more advanced with asynchrounous web server(in my opinion it is better than multithreaded web server).
For what you want, django is best suitable for you IMO.
