### Listing 856 - Obtaining a Reverse-Shell Through DCOM Lateral Movement

**Summary:**
We successfully gained access to an additional internal system by exploiting the DCOM MMC application.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the theory behind various lateral movement attacks.
- Execute these attacks from compromised clients.

### Next Steps: Maintaining Access through Persistence Techniques

**Objective:**
In the next section, we will explore how to maintain access on the target network using persistence techniques.

### 23.2 Active Directory Persistence

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the general purpose of persistence techniques.
- Leverage golden tickets as a persistence attack.
- Learn about shadow copies and how they can be abused for persistence.

**Introduction:**
Once an adversary has obtained access to one or more hosts, their goal is to maintain that access over time, even after reboots or credential changes. The MITRE ATT&CK framework defines persistence tactics as techniques aimed at maintaining an attacker's foothold on the target network.

**Persistence in Active Directory:**
While traditional persistence methods can be used in an Active Directory environment, there are also AD-specific techniques. Note that in many real-world penetration tests or red-team engagements, persistence is often out of scope due to the risk of incomplete removal after the assessment.

**Next Learning Unit:**
We will explore how golden tickets and shadow copy techniques can be misused to retain access.

### 23.2.1 Golden Ticket

**Kerberos Authentication Recap:**
When a user requests a TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket), the KDC (Key Distribution Center) encrypts the TGT with a secret key known only to the KDCs in the domain. This secret key is the password hash of the `krbtgt` account.

**Golden Ticket Attack:**
- **Concept:** If an attacker obtains the `krbtgt` password hash, they can create custom TGTs, known as golden tickets.
- **Powerful Attack Vector:** Unlike Silver Tickets, which forge TGS tickets for specific services, Golden Tickets grant access to the entire domain’s resources.
- **Example:** An attacker could create a TGT stating that a non-privileged user is a member of the Domain Admins group, and the domain controller will trust it because it is correctly encrypted.

**Protection and Execution:**
- **Stolen Hashes:** Stolen `krbtgt` password hashes must be carefully protected as they grant unlimited domain access.
- **Client Permission:** Explicitly obtain the client’s permission before executing this technique.
- **Password Change:** The `krbtgt` account password is not automatically changed, making it a persistent threat unless the domain functional level is upgraded.

**Testing the Technique:**
- **Initial Attempt:** Try to laterally move from a Windows 11 workstation to the domain controller via PsExec as a non-privileged user. This should fail due to insufficient permissions.
- **Mimikatz Extraction:** Log into the domain controller with administrative credentials, use Mimikatz to extract the `krbtgt` password hash, and create a golden ticket.
- **Injecting the Ticket:** Use Mimikatz to inject the golden ticket into memory and then attempt lateral movement again. This time, the attempt should succeed.

**Commands:**
```plaintext
mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK
mimikatz # lsadump::lsa /patch
mimikatz # kerberos::purge
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:jen /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-1987370270-658905905-1781884369 /krbtgt:1693c6cefafffc7af11ef34d1c788f47 /ptt
```

### 23.2.2 Shadow Copies

**Overview:**
A Shadow Copy, also known as Volume Shadow Service (VSS), is a Microsoft backup technology that allows the creation of snapshots of files or entire volumes.

**Management:**
- **vshadow.exe:** A Microsoft-signed binary included in the Windows SDK, used to manage volume shadow copies.
- **Abuse Potential:** As domain administrators, you can abuse the vshadow utility to create a Shadow Copy of the Active Directory Database (`NTDS.dit`) and extract user credentials offline.

**Procedure:**
1. Connect as a domain admin user to the domain controller.
2. Use vshadow.exe with the `-nw` option to disable writers and the `-p` option to store the copy on disk.
3. Note the shadow copy device name for further use.

**Commands:**
```plaintext
C:\Tools>vshadow.exe -nw -p C:
```
