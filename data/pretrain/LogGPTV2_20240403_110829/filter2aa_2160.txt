# CREATION OF THE DEFCON CHINA 1.0 BADGE

## Introduction
Joe Grand, also known as Kingpin, led the design and development of the DEFCON China 1.0 badge.

### Badge History
- **Community Engagement**: The badge was designed to bring the community together through interactive features.
- **Game Experience**: A game was created to encapsulate the DEFCON experience.
- **Design Philosophy**: The badge has a simple, expandable design that can be further developed during or after the conference.
- **Interactivity**: An interactive, command-based menu allows for additional exploration.

## Goals
- **Task Completion and Rewards**: Complete tasks to earn rewards.
- **LED Configuration**: The badge features 4 roots and 4 branches, each with 4 LEDs.
- **Unlocking Features**: When a task is completed, the badge is inserted into a programmer to unlock an LED.
- **Root Completion**: Special events occur when all roots are completed.
- **Full Completion**: Additional special events occur when all tasks are completed.

## Gameplay
### Early Concepts and Prototyping
- **Block Diagram**: The initial design included key components such as USB power, LED control, an accelerometer, and a microcontroller (MCU).
- **Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC)**: This was the first time an FPC was used in a conference badge, presenting new challenges and risks.
- **Edge Connector**: The FPC includes an edge connector for external interfaces, supporting UART, I2C, and AVR ICSP.
- **Pinout**:
  - GND
  - SCK
  - MISO
  - MOSI
  - /RST
  - SDA
  - SCL
  - SIN
  - SOUT
  - /SENSE
  - GPIO
  - VCC

### Hardware
- **USB Interface**: Allows for Arduino programming and interactive mode using the FT231X USB-to-Serial UART.
- **LED Matrix**: Multiplexed via a library, with rows controlled by discrete I/O and columns controlled by a 74HC595 shift register. Refresh rate is 175 Hz to reduce flicker.
- **Accelerometer**: Uses the ST Microelectronics LIS3DH, which provides 3-axis digital output and can detect motion or free fall. It helps preserve battery life by entering sleep mode after 10 seconds of inactivity.

### Bill of Materials
- **Arduino**: An open-source platform with easy-to-use hardware, software, and firmware. Third-party libraries add functionality.
- **Memory Usage**: 90% of Flash (27.6 kB) and 43% of RAM (887 bytes).

### Firmware
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Essential for rapid development, including Low-Power, Adafruit_LIS3DH, Adafruit_SENSOR, LED-Matrix, Adafruit-GFX-Library, DIO2, and TimerOne.
- **Loop Function**: Handles power state, interactive mode, FPC communication, and LED updates.

### Fabrication and Assembly
- **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+**: Used for programming the FT231X and ATmega328P via USB.
- **Power-On Self-Test**: Includes visual inspection of LEDs and detection of the accelerometer.
- **Badge Types**:
  - Human (Attendee): 2,784
  - Goon: 156
  - Speaker: 50
  - Village: 90
  - Sponsor: 120
  - Press: 100
  - Total: 3,300

### Challenges
- **Battery Life**: Uses a CR2032 3V lithium coin cell with 225 mAh capacity. Power consumption ranges from 3.3 mA (idle) to 10 mA (all LEDs enabled) and 4-6 Î¼A (sleep mode).
- **Mechanical Weaknesses**: Reworking the flex PCB and managing the tight timeframe.

### Accessories
- **Breakout Board**: Provides access to all FPC signals, including UART, IIC, and AVR ICSP. Available in the HHV and badge hacking workshop.
- **Programming Shield**: Enables serial communication via FPC, setting/clearing individual LEDs, and reading the badge state. Uses an Arduino with a custom shield, TXS0104 level translator, and dip switches.

### Demonstration
- **The Tree of Promise**: An interactive art installation by Deqing Sun and Peiqi Su (New York Interactive). The semi-physical, semi-digital tree grows in a 6-meter container, using badges to interact with an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and OpenFrameworks.
- **Features**:
  - LED tree fruit
  - Graphics displayed on a 3D cube
  - Touch-sensitive branches
  - Algorithm generates a unique branch for each attendee
