### Abstract
Access and search pattern leakage from range queries are detrimental to the security of encrypted databases, as evidenced by a large body of work on attacks that reconstruct one-dimensional (1D) databases. Recently, the first attack on 2D range queries showed that higher-dimensional databases are also at risk (Falzon et al., CCS 2020). Their attack requires the access and search pattern of all possible queries. We present an order reconstruction attack that depends only on access pattern leakage and empirically show that the order allows the attacker to infer the geometry of the underlying data. This attack achieves full database reconstruction when the 1D horizontal and vertical projections of the points are dense. We also introduce an approximate database reconstruction attack that is distribution-agnostic and works with any sample of queries, given the search and access pattern leakage of those queries and the order of the database records. Finally, we demonstrate how to improve the reconstruction with auxiliary information (e.g., the centroid of a related dataset). Our results are supported by formal analysis and experiments on real-world databases with queries drawn from various distributions.

### 1. Introduction
The growing adoption of cloud computing and storage over the past two decades has been accompanied by an increase in data breaches. Encrypted cloud storage reduces the risk of such breaches. Searchable encryption provides a practical solution for processing queries over encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, searchable encryption schemes often sacrifice full security by leaking some information about the queries and their responses, making the underlying data vulnerable to inference attacks. Various mitigation techniques have been developed to defend against these attacks (e.g., [4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17–20, 23, 25–29, 32–34, 36, 38]). Systems implementing these schemes have been developed in both academia (e.g., [37, 39]) and industry (e.g., [35]).

#### Types of Leakage
In searchable encryption schemes, two standard types of leakage occur:
- **Access Pattern Leakage**: The adversary observes the encrypted records returned in response to queries.
- **Search Pattern Leakage**: The adversary can distinguish if a query has been previously issued, i.e., can assign a unique query identifier to each distinct query.

This work considers an encrypted database with two attributes, referred to as a two-dimensional (2D) database, to which range queries are issued. We assume a passive, persistent adversary who observes the entire access pattern leakage and a subset of the search pattern leakage. Our adversary aims to reconstruct the order of the database records in the two dimensions (attributes) using solely the access pattern, a problem called order reconstruction (OR). The adversary then performs an approximate reconstruction of the (attribute) values of the database records by using the partial search pattern observed, a problem called approximate database reconstruction (ADR). A more ambitious goal is full database reconstruction (FDR), which aims to compute the exact record values, up to unavoidable symmetries and other information-theoretic limitations.

### 1.1 Contributions
Previous work on reconstruction attacks from range queries on 2D databases [13] assumes that the adversary has knowledge of the entire access and search pattern leakage (i.e., has seen all possible queries and their responses) and uses both forms of leakage to perform an attack that reconstructs the record values in polynomial time, up to inherent information-theoretic limitations. In contrast, we investigate what information is recoverable from 2D range queries when given only a fraction of the possible responses. Our contributions include:

1. **Information-Theoretic Limitations**: We show that order reconstruction faces additional information-theoretic limitations when given only access pattern leakage. We describe and prove a complete characterization of the family of databases that have the same access pattern leakage.
2. **Order Reconstruction Attack**: We present an order reconstruction attack that allows an adversary with the entire access pattern to build a linear-space representation of the family of databases in polynomial time.
3. **Approximate Database Reconstruction Attack**: We design a distribution-agnostic approximate database reconstruction attack that reconstructs record values given the order of the records and the search and access pattern leakage from any number of queries drawn from an unknown distribution.
4. **Empirical Evaluation**: We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our attacks on real-world datasets using a variety of range query distributions.
5. **New Concepts and Algorithms**: We develop new combinatorial and geometric concepts and algorithms related to point reconstruction from range queries that may be of independent interest.

Our work provides the first order reconstruction attack in 2D from access pattern leakage and the first approximate reconstruction attack in 2D from partial search pattern leakage and an unknown query distribution. Our order reconstruction attack does not require knowledge of the domain size and, instead, gives us a lower bound of the domain size. This attack is also a full database reconstruction attack for the case when the 1D horizontal and vertical projections of the points are dense, i.e., have a record for every domain value.

### 1.2 Encrypted Databases and 2D Range Queries
There are several schemes that support two-dimensional range queries over encrypted data. All existing schemes leak access and search patterns, and many leak strictly more information. Our work is motivated by the need to understand what can be learned from information leakage that seems unavoidable without employing the use of oblivious RAMs (ORAMs) [16] or fully homomorphic encryption [15], both of which incur significant overhead.

- **MRQED (Shi et al. [41])**: This scheme leverages public key encryption and builds a binary tree on the values of each dimension, releasing public keys corresponding to the nodes that cover the range of interest. The server learns both search and access patterns, the plaintexts of the matching records, and structural information about the range query issued.
- **Maple (Kamara et al. [48])**: This tree-based public-key multi-dimensional range searchable encryption scheme aims to provide single-dimensional privacy, mitigating one-dimensional database reconstruction attacks. It leaks access and search patterns, the nodes accessed when traversing the range tree, and the values of each queried range.
- **Index-Based Construction (Cash et al. [5])**: To mitigate 1D attacks and avoid leaking information about individual columns, one can precompute a joint index of all possible 2D queries and encrypt the resulting index. When a 2D query is issued, only records matching the query are returned.

- **(b)** Approximate geometric reconstruction given the order of the points and partial search pattern of 1M queries drawn from a uniform distribution. We achieve an almost exact reconstruction while prior work [13] needed 455M queries on average for exact reconstruction.

### Conclusion
Our work demonstrates that an adversary can infer much about the original data with significantly less information than previously thought. Specifically, we achieve order reconstruction given only the access pattern and an effective approximate database reconstruction given the search pattern from a small fraction of queries. Our techniques are distribution-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of query distributions, providing a significant step forward in understanding and mitigating the risks of information leakage in encrypted databases.
