Template filled out below but this is pretty clear.
This line populates Worker.task_events using `either`:  
celery/celery/worker/worker.py
Line 377 in 04771d6
|  self.task_events = either('worker_send_task_events', task_events)  
---|---  
However, as of version 5, the `task_events` arg is `False` here when the
argument is omitted from the command line, not `None`. So `either`, which
looks for the first non-`None` value, always returns `False` and ignores the
value from `app.conf`.
Works as expected in 4.4.7.

## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
Install Celery, save the following in testapp.py
    from celery import Celery
    app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//')
    app.conf.worker_send_task_events = True
and run `celery -A testapp worker --loglevel=INFO`.
# Expected Behavior
In the startup banner, I expect to see `task events: ON` and for events to be
sent.
# Actual Behavior
The startup banner says `task events: OFF (enable -E to monitor tasks in this
worker)` and events are not sent.
