have been either entirely revised or are at least strongly
challenged [11, 12, 25, 26, 34].
User capability, user inclusion in their own and oth-
ers’ security, and a holistic approach to defensive secu-
rity then together serve as indicators for identifying a
sustainable, workable, and ultimately secure password
system. With this in mind, we design the analysis of the
password dataset in a way that considers the rewards (and
costs) for (i) the user, and (ii) the organisation.
3 Methodology
Here we describe the methodology for analysing the logs
of the password change system at UCL. We were not in-
volved in the design of the policy or the choice of pass-
word strength estimator. We were approached by the IT
services department who were eager to collaborate on ex-
ploring the scientiﬁc value of their policy design and its
impact on the system’s users. This lead to a productive
working relationship for this project, which helped us to
reason about the results and discuss possible causes for
data patterns outside of the password system itself. This
is especially important given the complexities not only
of the data and the systems to which the data applies, but

also the institution, being that is has tens of thousands of
account holders with varying levels and modes of inter-
action with the system.
The main contribution of this work is a scientiﬁc anal-
ysis of the effect of the policy. The analysis is informed
by consideration of the cost of the policy to users.
3.1 The interface
The password change/reset interface is web-based. The
new password has to be typed twice. Below the sec-
ond password entry box are a password strength meter
and a text ﬁeld that displays the new password’s lifetime
in days. Both meter and days of password lifetime up-
date on any change to the ﬁrst new password form ﬁeld.
For passwords of < 50 bits of entropy the strength me-
ter states Too weak and the password cannot be submit-
ted. Passwords of lifetime 100 to 163 days are stated to
be of Medium strength (yellow strength bar). Between
164 and 223 days a password is considered to be Strong
(green bar), and beyond that the password is classed as
Very strong (dark green bar).
3.2 The dataset
We received access to the password change and reset
logs, which consisted of timestamps, anonymised user
IDs, action performed (i.e., change/reset/etc), the inte-
ger password lifetime of the new password (100–350),
as well as some coarse demographics information for the
100,000 users. We received IRB approval for our ap-
proach to log analysis, alongside in-person interviews
with a subset of system users (see Section 4.7) (UCL
Ethics ID 5336/007). Regarding the dataset, we had
no individually-identifying information (an arrangement
made with the system owners at point of data access),
as well as only a single number for the user’s password
strength (i.e., not the password itself or any element of
it). The password log data was stored on encrypted
drives, and regular extensions to the dataset over time
were transferred and stored securely.
The policy came into effect in October ’16 and users
began using the new system from that date when next
requiring to change or reset their password. As the pre-
vious policy’s expiration was set to 150 days, all active
passwords will have been transferred to the new policy
by April ’17 (so that in effect it was a soft transition).
Although we continue to have access to new data, we are
conﬁdent that 14 months of complete data is sufﬁcient,
for the following reasons:
• The dataset includes at least one academic year’s
worth of data and regular events in an academic
year, such as school closures and holidays;
system;
• All currently active passwords were set on the new
• There are approximately six months of system
events for the annual intake of new students (aca-
demic year starts in September to October, as seen
for instance in Figure 2), who were never exposed
to the previous policy.
3.3 Calculation of entropy
The minimum password requirements involve a complex
combination of a number of ﬁxed rules. Passwords are
initially checked against static requirements. Passwords
are required to: include at least one character from three
of four possible character types (lowercase character, up-
percase character, number, and symbol); be between 8
and 30 characters long, and; not contain the user’s user-
name or parts of their real name. The entropy of a pass-
word is then calculated by estimating the information en-
tropy of the password by multiplying the size of the char-
acter class of each of the characters [2]. A number of
factors decrease the entropy: repeated characters; lexi-
cographically subsequent characters as well as the pres-
ence of a substring of the password in a dictionary of
size 306,000. Common character substitutions are also
checked against the dictionary.
3.4 Uses of a password
Studying adoption and use of the system over time is
important, where understanding new authentication sys-
tems in terms of how easy they are to learn is critical [8].
The password studied should be the only password staff
and students require to access necessary services for
work or study respectively. UCL uses one password for
all of their services. This includes access to timetabling,
e-learning resources, university e-mail, logging on to
physical desktop machines, and WiFi. The frequency of
use of this password is expected to vary naturally for dif-
ferent user types, who use different services, and access
them from different machines (the most simple differen-
tiation being a device they manage themselves or a ﬁxed-
place common-access machine). While users may resort
to password managers to store their password for use
in browsers, students (Undergraduate, Postgraduate and
Medical) accessing the machines in university computer
rooms will still have to type the password. Similarly,
administrative staff work on a university computer and
therefore have to regularly type the password to log in to
and unlock their machines. Research staff and students
however may have the ﬂexibility to type their password
very infrequently, especially if (a) they are using devices
which they themselves manage and which no other user
would have access to, and (b) they can complete their
242    27th USENIX Security Symposium

work or study activities with minimal or ad-hoc access
to services managed through the single-sign-on system.
Ad-hoc access may be governed by the nature of the
work done by distinct specialised groups, hence we are
also interested in adoption and use differentiated by fac-
ulty/department.Users may then balance the convenience
of accessing a system with the security of the mechanism
that facilitates access to that system [6].
3.5 Perceived value of a password
Individuals in organisations will strive to protect their ac-
count if they perceive and understand a need to keep their
organisation secure [1]. The UK’s Universities and Col-
leges Information Systems Association (UCISA) distin-
guishes between the information security roles and com-
petencies for distinct groups in universities [42]. Assum-
ing that system users are aware of responsibilities like
those described in the guide, they may have distinct atti-
tudes towards the security of their accounts, and the asso-
ciated passwords. Researchers may for instance have ac-
cess to sensitive data, whereas administrators and teach-
ing staff alike may manage staff and student records. Stu-
dents may have access to their own information, but also
the university’s IT infrastructure; postgraduate students
might have access to research data.
By considering factors which may inﬂuence the per-
ceived value of a user’s password, the scope of RQ2 is
reﬁned. Given both the frequency of use and the per-
ceived value of accounts, we expect students to have
weaker passwords than other groups, and researchers to
have stronger passwords. We also expect administra-
tive staff to value their account security while balancing
any increases to password strength (delaying password
change) with lower time cost per system authentication
event. Regular enactment of security tasks over a work-
ing day may push users in an organisation to ﬁnd ways
to reduce the burden of security that relates to their pri-
mary productive work [6]. We test these hypotheses in
Section 4.4.
3.6 User interviews
In addition to the password log analysis, 93 users of uni-
versity systems were interviewed between February and
March ’17 (53 students and 40 staff). Users who had
changed their password in the prior 2-3 months, or who
had just received a reminder to change their password,
were invited for interview. This framing allowed for the
possibility that participants would not know that there
was a new password policy.
The study was advertised via staff and student newslet-
ters, and ﬂyers positioned around the main university
campus. Interviews were approximately 30 minutes in

The mean frequency is 147.74 and 146.60 days for

duration, and included discussion of: services accessed
through university login; perceptions of passwords and
security in relation to university-related tasks, and; par-
ticipants views of the university’s password system. A
computer displaying the interface of the new system sup-
ported the interview (as described in Section 3.1). Partic-
ipants were provided with a £15 voucher for completing
the interview.
The average participant age of staff members and stu-
dents were 34.6 and 22.8 respectively. Student partic-
ipants had been at the organisation on average for ap-
proximately two years (including many who had joined
the university just before the new system was deployed);
staff participants had used the university systems for on
average of approximately ﬁve years. Participants repre-
sented a range of schools and divisions (including admin-
istrative functions).
4 Results
In this section we describe the properties of user pass-
words found in the data, as well as characterise the adop-
tion and usage behaviour for the new system across the
user population and speciﬁc groups. We put our results in
the context of existing research and highlight the impact
of the policy on user behaviour.
Figure 1 describes the distribution of strength of all
passwords observed in the university. The two distri-
butions of password resets (when a password has been
forgotten or it has expired) and changes (when the user
still knows the previous password) are virtually identical.
The histogram is strongly skewed to the left and decays
rapidly, apart from approximately 1% of passwords that
achieve the maximum strength of 350 days.
It is interesting to compare this distribution to the pass-
word strength distribution of Mazurek et al.’s study per-

formed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) [32, Fig-
ure 7, page 11]. Their measured password strengths ap-
proximate a uniform distribution between 109 (100 days)
and 1014 (225 days) guesses, and only 42% of passwords
are guessed in 1014 guesses. Their estimated mean pass-
word entropy is 36.8 bits, compared to 69.64 bits here.
There are two systematic explanations for these stark
differences. First, the mean password entropy reported
by Mazurek et al. is calculated by state-of-the-art brute-
forcing, compared to an information theoretic approach
chosen by our IT department that only weakly correlates
to actual password strength. Thus, our entropy estimates
are likely large over-estimations [46, Fig. 8]. Secondly,
the entropy estimate in our analysis is the same estimate
used for providing feedback to the user in the form of the
password meter (principally the fullness of the bar), and
the weakest allowed password has an entropy of 50 bits.
This explains the high concentration of passwords with
100 days lifetime, compared to the study performed at
CMU; where policy and strength meter are not linked to
the measured guessing strength.
The same explanations also apply to the differences
between our analysis and Bonneau’s analysis of crack-
ing attempts of the Yahoo! password dataset [7, Figure 6
in particular]. Their identiﬁed cumulative distribution is
aligned with our data, although Bonneau achieves a 50%
success rate with 106 guesses.
4.1 Noteworthy events during the study
As with any study of an active real-world system, there
are external events that have an effect on the system be-
ing studied. As we cannot control for these events, they
should be acknowledged in the analysis. Further, exter-
nal events can be leveraged to understand if there are par-
ticular kinds of events which can inﬂuence the adoption
and use of an authentication system at a large organisa-
tion. Figure 2 highlights three families of events.
From the deployment of the new system in October
’16 the userbase of the new system slowly grows as
users change or reset their passwords (where this forces
them to use the new system and hence appear in the
dataset). Secondly, there is a peak of password resets in
Jan-Feb 2017, which corresponds to the expiration of all
passwords of users who joined the university in Septem-
ber ’16 and had a ﬁxed lifetime of 150 days. We ex-
pected that the rate of resets would decrease once users
became familiar with the new system. This did not hap-
pen, indicating that familiarity with the system does not
reduce the need to reset. The third event of note refers
to the peak of new user being onboarded to the system in
September ’17 in time for the new academic year, where
over 10,000 new students joined the university. This also
causes the simultaneous peak in the number of changes,
as setting an initial password is classiﬁed as a change.
