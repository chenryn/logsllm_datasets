User: I have been wondering if developing Linux kernel modules (drivers) with Python is possible. Is it?
Assistant: No; LKM on Linux have to be compiled down do a specific ELF object code format.
Of course you could make your own hack of Python that does compile down to kernel object code, but as far as I know, at this time there is no such Python publicly available.
