ATT&CK Technique Name:Privileged Account Management
Limit the number of cloud accounts with permissions to remotely execute commands on virtual machines, and ensure that these are not used for day-to-day operations. In Azure, limit the number of accounts with the roles Azure Virtual Machine Contributer and above, and consider using temporary Just-in-Time (JIT) roles to avoid permanently assigning privileged access to virtual machines.[6] In Azure AD, limit the number of Global and Intune administrators to only those required. In AWS, limit users with permission to execute the ssm:SendCommand action, and use tags to restrict the number of machines those users can execute commands on.[7]
