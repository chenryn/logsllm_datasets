### Image and Metadata Analysis

**Figure 11: Embedded Image in the Pictures Folder**

If this image is extracted and analyzed, it will retain all the original metadata and a thumbnail that shows its initial state. You can use any EXIF reader tool to analyze the thumbnail attached to the image, as demonstrated in Figure 12.

### 2.7 Modifications

One of the features offered by OpenOffice Writer is the ability to track changes in documents. This is particularly useful when multiple users are collaborating on a document or when you want to log all modifications. The "Track Changes" feature can be activated from the "Edit" menu, and it allows you to make changes visible or hide them.

A user might inadvertently work on a document with this feature enabled. If the document is published without removing the change history, anyone can see what has been added or removed, who made the changes, and when they were made.

**Figure 13: Changes Not Displayed**

**Figure 14: Changes Displayed**

When you hover over a change in the document, a message appears indicating who made the change and when. All this information about the change history is stored in the `content.xml` file:

```xml
<text:change>
  <text:author>MiNombre MiApellido</text:author>
  <text:date-time>2008-08-13T13:07:00</text:date-time>
  <text:changed-region>lamentablemente pat√©tica</text:changed-region>
</text:change>
```

### 2.8 Hidden Paragraphs

OpenOffice also offers the option to hide text or paragraphs. This functionality allows you to work on a document in one view with hidden paragraphs (ready for printing) and in another view with all paragraphs visible (for editing purposes). To hide a paragraph, you can include a special field in the paragraph.

You can toggle the display of hidden text using the "View" menu. If a document contains hidden paragraphs but the option to view them is not enabled, you may be working with a version that does not show all the information in the document.

**Figure 15: Document with Hidden Paragraphs**
**Figure 16: Document Displaying Hidden Paragraphs**

### 2.9 Hidden Information Due to Format

Another type of hidden content is text or images that are not visible due to the document format. For example, an image might overlap with other content, or the text might be the same color as the background. This kind of content should be carefully reviewed before publishing the document.

### 2.10 Notes, Headers, Footnotes, and Comments

In an OpenOffice document, there are several places where you can enter information that may go unnoticed during subsequent reviews. These include headers, footnotes, online annotations, and comments, which can be added using the "Notes" option in the "Insert" menu. Unless specified otherwise, these notes are not included when the document is printed or exported to PDF format, making it easy to overlook this information during reviews.

**Figure 17: Defining a Document as Printable or Not Printable**

### 2.11 Customized Metadata

Metadata, as discussed in the introduction, are not inherently harmful and can be very useful for certain applications. In OpenOffice, users can include customized metadata in their documents using the "Properties" option from the "File" menu. Additionally, if a document is created from another previous document, it may inherit metadata from that source.

**Figure 18: Customized Metadata**

Customized metadata can be used as a working tool during document creation and may include corporate or personal opinions, identifications, and other personal data. All this information must be reviewed before the document is published.

### 2.12 Databases

The integration of documents with databases is another important consideration. Modern Office applications allow the generation of templates that, when combined with databases, can produce customized and automated documents. These templates, designed for mail merging, contain information about the database they are linked to. This information can be found in the `settings.xml` file, which includes details about the database name and the table used for the merge.

**Figure 19: Database Information in settings.xml**

The `content.xml` file also contains the name of the database, the table, and the fields:

```xml
...
```

**Figure 20: Database Information in content.xml**

However, connection credentials to the database are not stored in the ODF document. This information, which could reveal the path to a database file or server access credentials, is stored in a user's profile file called `DataAccess.xcu`. This file should be protected to prevent unauthorized access.

**Path to DataAccess.xcu:**
```
C:\Documents and Settings\USER_ACCOUNT\Program data\OpenOffice.org2\user\registry\data\org\openoffice\Office\DataAccess.xcu
```

Even though connection credentials are not published, the information stored with the document may be enough to help a potential attacker prepare attacks, such as SQL injection, on the company's website.

### 2.13 Versions of Documents

Like other Office packages, OpenOffice allows saving different versions of the same document. This feature is extremely useful in collaborative environments, allowing for the evaluation of changes and the restoration of previous states if necessary. The "Versions" option in the "File" menu saves the current version of the document and creates a new version each time it is saved.

**Figure 21: Document Versions (Software in Spanish)**

Within an ODF document that contains different versions, you can find important information. First, a file called `VersionList.xml` contains information about who saved each version and when:

```xml
...
```

**Figure 22: VersionList.xml**

Secondly, all different versions of the document are stored in a folder called "Versions." Each version contains the complete structure of an OpenOffice document, including files like `meta.xml`, `settings.xml`, and `content.xml`.

**Figure 23: Versions Folder**

### 2.14 Analysis and Cleaning Tools

There are tools available to analyze and remove metadata in OpenOffice, such as 3BOpenDoc or 3BClean. However, these tools only remove the `meta.xml` file, leaving information about printers, internal servers, and database connections in the `settings.xml` and `content.xml` files.

While the `meta.xml` file is important, as it is not encrypted even when the document is password-protected, the rest of the metadata is equally significant. Therefore, it is crucial to have a tool that can analyze all the information stored in these files and provide a user-friendly environment for cleaning all metadata in OpenOffice documents.

**Figure 24: Delete All Personal Information When Saving the Document (Software in Spanish)**

The "Delete All Personal Information" option in OpenOffice does not remove information about the operating system, printers, product version, or template paths. This information can reveal hidden routes or addresses of internal servers and database connection information.

### 2.15 OOMetaExtractor

To address these issues, we developed a tool called OOMetaExtractor, which is available under the Microsoft Public License on Codeplex. This tool, developed in .NET, requires the .NET Framework and has been tested on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

OOMetaExtractor allows users to analyze not only a single ODF document but also an entire folder of ODF documents in ODT, ODS, or ODP formats. It displays all metadata and hidden information, which can be exported to a text file. Additionally, the tool cleans all documents, including templates, links, printer configurations, and customized metadata.

To create a company policy for metadata, OOMetaExtractor includes an option to set up a metadata template, specifying what to do with certain types of metadata. For example, you can set the company name in the company metadata or a fixed author for all documents.

**Figure 26: OOMetaExtractor (in Spanish)**

### 3. Metadata and Hidden Information in Microsoft Office Documents

During the installation of Microsoft Office, a dialog prompts the user to input personal information. This information is then added to every document created or edited by that user.

**Figure 27: User Information in Microsoft Office 2003**

In multi-user environments, the same software is often used by different users on the same computer. When a new user runs an Office application for the first time, a dialog asks for their information, which is then added to every document they edit or create.

**Figure 28: Another User Starts Microsoft Office 2003**

This information can pose a risk, especially because the default value for the "Name" field is the user account name.

### 3.1 Document Properties

When creating a document, authors can assign metadata, such as a short description, keywords, and department. This data is stored indefinitely within the document file. If a document containing metadata is used as a template for new documents, the new documents will inherit this information.

Document metadata is customizable, so it may contain any attribute and value the author adds. This must be considered when publishing documents in corporate environments, as inappropriate metadata can damage the organization's image.

**Figure 29: Document Properties (in Spanish)**

### 3.2 Embedded Files

Microsoft Office allows users to embed images and other documents into their files. These embedded documents may contain their own metadata, potentially leading to information leaks.

For example, an image created with GIMP, a graphic document creation program, contains EXIF information, which can be read with any EXIF extraction tool. The image metadata includes the program used and a thumbnail.

**Figure 30: EXIF Metadata in an Embedded Image**

Embedding this image in a Microsoft Word 97 document and using a hexadecimal editor, you can read the image metadata. The thumbnail may differ from the image, indicating that some editing has been done.

### 3.3 Extracting Embedded Files

It is straightforward to extract embedded files from Microsoft Word DOC, Excel XLS, or PowerPoint PPT files. By saving the document in HTML (web page) format, these programs extract the embedded files and store them as independent files.

**Figure 31: Extracting Embedded Files**

Microsoft Office versions do not modify EXIF information unless the author uses the "Modify Image" option and saves the document. Microsoft Office 2007 introduced the OOXML file format (ISO DIS 29500), where DOCX, XLSX, and PPTX files are ZIP-compressed archives. Embedded files are stored as independent items and can be easily extracted.

**Figure 32: Files Inside an OOXML File**

### 3.4 Revisions and Modifications

The "Track Changes" feature in Microsoft Office is particularly useful for document sharing and workflows. It allows multiple users to work on the same document while keeping track of who made each change, enabling the recovery of previous document states.

However, when the document is made public, this data is no longer useful and can become compromising. As shown in the image, older contents are displayed in red, and the final document view may differ from the original.

**Figure 33: Changes Can Be Seen (Image in Spanish)**

### 3.5 Notes, Headers, and Page Footers

Other places where unintended information may appear include notes, headers, footers, and presentation annotations. These can contain reference codes, names of users who worked on the document, or file paths. All this information must be considered before publishing the document.

### 3.6 Elements Hidden by Their Format

In a Microsoft Office document, an image can be hidden by other elements above it. Template elements may contain undesired data that can be hidden by document text or images. Some text may be the same color as the background, making it invisible. All these items should be reviewed before the document is published.
