## Abstract

Payment card fraud results in billions of dollars in annual losses. Adversaries increasingly use skimmers, which are attached to legitimate payment devices such as point-of-sale (POS) terminals, gas pumps, and ATMs, to acquire card data. Detecting these skimmers is challenging, and while many experts offer advice, there is no comprehensive characterization of skimmer technology to support such defenses. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale study based on skimmers recovered by the New York Police Department's (NYPD) Financial Crimes Task Force over a 16-month period. After systematically analyzing these devices, we develop the Skim Reaper, a detector that leverages the physical properties and constraints necessary for many skimmers to steal card data. Our analysis shows that the Skim Reaper effectively detects 100% of the devices supplied by the NYPD, providing the first robust and portable mechanism for detecting card skimmers.

## 1. Introduction

Credit and debit cards dominate the payment landscape, fundamentally transforming consumer behavior by reducing the risks associated with carrying cash and streamlining transactions at gas stations and other retail settings. Consumers now prefer using payment cards in retail settings by a margin of more than three-to-one [52].

However, the ease with which fraud can be committed against these cards is well-known. Attackers often use skimmers—devices attached to legitimate payment terminals designed to illicitly capture account information. Once installed, skimmers are nearly invisible to the untrained eye, allowing attackers to sell stolen data or create counterfeit cards. Such fraud is projected to reach over $30 billion by 2020 [5]. Even with the increased rollout of EMV-enabled cards, ATM fraud has increased by nearly 40% in 2017 [28]. Without reliable methods for rapidly identifying skimming devices, the frequency of such fraud is likely to continue growing.

In this paper, we design and deploy a device for detecting skimmers. We start by conducting the largest academic analysis of such devices to date. We then use the results of this analysis to develop the Skim Reaper, a portable, payment card-shaped device that relies on the intrinsic properties of magnetic stripe reading to detect the presence of additional read heads in a payment terminal. The Skim Reaper is inserted into the card slot and counts the number of read heads present; terminals with more than one read head are identified as having a skimmer.

Our contributions include:
- **Characterization and Taxonomy of Recovered Skimmers:** We partnered with the NYPD's Financial Crimes Task Force to systematize the unique skimmers they identified over nearly 16 months. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale academic examination of real skimmers. We use this analysis to show that common advice for detecting skimmers is not effective against modern skimming attacks.
- **Development of a Portable Detection Tool:** We develop and present the Skim Reaper, a card-shaped device for detecting multiple read heads in a card slot. We explain the physics of reading magnetic stripe cards and show how these principles can be used to effectively detect read heads and prevent adversarial countermeasures.
- **Validation Using Real Skimmers:** We confirm the effectiveness of our system on a custom, 3D-printed skimmer and 10 real-world skimmers, demonstrating its robustness against a wide variety of skimmer form factors.

The security of payment systems, particularly ATMs, has been extensively studied in computer security [11]. Despite this, these systems remain significantly vulnerable and require continued attention.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of payment card readers and fraud against these devices; Section 3 analyzes and categorizes the skimming devices found by the NYPD's Financial Crimes Task Force in 2017; Section 4 details the design of the Skim Reaper; Section 5 presents experimental results against real recovered skimming devices; Section 6 discusses countermeasures and other insights; Section 7 examines related research; and Section 8 offers concluding remarks.

## 2. Fundamentals of Card Reading & Fraud

### 2.1 Magnetic Stripe Encoding

Magnetic stripes store small amounts of data using frequency/double frequency (F2F) encoding. F2F stores both the clock and the data, allowing a reader to quickly synchronize and read the data even when the card moves at an inconsistent speed. Figure 1 illustrates how decoding is performed: a magnetic polarity change within a clock cycle indicates a 1, while no change indicates a 0. The bitstream is then decoded into plaintext characters containing the card data (e.g., name, account number, and expiration date). Data is stored on up to three adjacent tracks on a single stripe, each with its own standard for character encoding and density [29, 30].

### 2.2 Fraud

Magnetic stripe cards offer no inherent protection from duplication. All data on the card's tracks are written in plaintext, and an adversary with access to the magnetic stripe (e.g., via a skimmer) can create a legitimate card. These cloned cards, while magnetically distinguishable from the originals [4, 48], contain the same data.

To prevent the use of counterfeit cards, banks and payment networks added Card Verification Values (CVVs). CVV1 codes are part of the data on the magnetic stripe and prevent cloning with only the printed data (e.g., the account number). However, if the adversary can read the magnetic stripe, the CVV1 code can be easily cloned. CVV2 codes are printed on the physical card and are often requested for phone or online purchases (card-not-present transactions). This code is intended to prove possession of the original card. Adversaries can acquire this code through various means, including recording PIN entry with a camera, purchasing card data with codes, and compromising web browsers [35].

Once the adversary has obtained the data and created a counterfeit card, the cards are "cashed out." Counterfeit cards are used to purchase goods (to be resold later) or to withdraw cash from an ATM. Once purchases for a given card are declined, the cards are discarded.

### 2.3 Common Advice

Card skimming is a well-known crime, and advice aimed at protecting consumers is widespread. The most common suggestions are:
1. Look for signs of a skimmer.
2. Pull on the card reader.
3. Use a smartphone app to scan for skimmers with Bluetooth radios.
4. Use an EMV (Chip) card.
5. Use cash.

While these tips may seem helpful, many offer little in terms of specific steps. Tips 1 and 2 suggest that users know how payment devices should look and feel, but this is often insufficient. Tip 3 proposes using a smartphone-based app to detect Bluetooth radios, which can be tested and evaluated. Tip 4 suggests using chip-enabled cards, but EMV deployment is far from universal, and EMV-enabled cards still have a magnetic stripe as a backup, which can be used to clone card data. Finally, Tip 5 requires significant behavioral changes, which are unlikely to be widely adopted.

We will further evaluate Tips 1, 2, and 3 in the next section.

## 3. Characterizing Real-World Skimmers

Common advice for reducing the risk of skimming is based on the detectability of individual skimmer models, rather than a comprehensive understanding of skimming attacks. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of real-world skimmers, leading to a gap in our understanding of these devices and their continued success despite the advice.

To gain a better understanding, we partnered with the NYPD Financial Crimes Task Force and obtained their skimmer BOLOs (Be On the Look Out) for the period from July 14, 2016, to November 11, 2017. The 35 memos we obtained provide the location, type, and data retrieval method for unique skimmers discovered during this time. Table 1 shows the breakdown of the recovered skimmers, providing insight into the variety of skimming technology confiscated in the New York City market. We explore these reports and perform the first large-scale characterization and breakdown of skimmers.

### 3.1 Taxonomy

In the skimmers discovered by the NYPD, we found five distinct installation points for skimmers in two categories: those requiring only external access to the target device and those requiring internal access. For external access, the skimmer can be installed without opening the payment device; for internal access, the payment device must be opened (e.g., via key or drilling a hole). We further divide these into skimmer types, which for external-access skimmers consist of: overlays, deep-inserts, shimmers, and wiretaps. Figure 2 provides a diagram of an ATM with the placement of each type of skimmer.

#### 3.1.1 External-Access Skimmers

Skimmers requiring no access to the internals of the target machine were the most common type of device recovered. These are the lowest-risk devices to deploy, as they can be installed in seconds [54] and are difficult to identify without expertise.

Overlays were the most prevalent device discovered in our dataset, comprising nearly half (46%) of the skimmers. These devices are placed on top of the card slot, custom-designed to match the target machine. The rear side of the overlay contains a magnetic read head, decoding and storage equipment, and a battery. Since the overlay sits atop the card acceptor, only millimeters exist between the new facade and the original slot, making it nearly impossible to detect without specialized tools.
