Abstract
Payment card fraud results in billions of dollars in
losses annually. Adversaries increasingly acquire card
data using skimmers, which are attached to legitimate
payment devices including point of sale terminals, gas
pumps, and ATMs. Detecting such devices can be dif-
ﬁcult, and while many experts offer advice in doing so,
there exists no large-scale characterization of skimmer
technology to support such defenses. In this paper, we
perform the ﬁrst such study based on skimmers recov-
ered by the NYPD’s Financial Crimes Task Force over
a 16 month period. After systematizing these devices,
we develop the Skim Reaper, a detector which takes ad-
vantage of the physical properties and constraints neces-
sary for many skimmers to steal card data. Our analysis
shows the Skim Reaper effectively detects 100% of de-
vices supplied by the NYPD. In so doing, we provide the
ﬁrst robust and portable mechanism for detecting card
skimmers.

Introduction
Credit and debit cards dominate the payment landscape.
Such cards have fundamentally transformed consumer
behavior, from reducing the dangers of needing to carry
large sums of cash to eliminating interaction between
customers and employees at gas stations. Consumers
now prefer to use such payment cards in the retail set-
ting by a margin of more than three-to-one [52].
Almost as well-known as the cards themselves is the
ease with which fraud can be committed against them.
Attackers often acquire card data using skimmers – de-
vices attached to legitimate payment terminals that are
designed to illicitly capture account information. Once
installed, skimmers are nearly invisible to the untrained
eye and allow attackers to sell stolen data or create coun-
terfeit cards. Such fraud is projected to reach over
$30 billion by 2020 [5]. Moreover, even with the in-
creased rollout of EMV-enabled cards, such fraud con-
tinues to grow, with ATM fraud increasing nearly 40%
in 2017 [28]. Without reliable methods for rapidly iden-
tifying the presence of skimming devices, the frequency
of such fraud is likely to continue growing.
In this paper, we design and deploy a device for de-
tecting skimmers. We start by conducting the largest
ever academic analysis of such devices. We then use
the results of this analysis to develop the Skim Reaper,
a portable, payment card-shaped device that relies on the
intrinsic properties of magnetic stripe reading to detect
the presence of additional read heads in a payment ter-
minal. The Skim Reaper is inserted into the card slot and
counts the number of read heads present in the slot; those
payment terminals with more than one are identiﬁed as
having a skimmer.
We address these problems through the following con-
tributions:
• Characterize and Taxonomize Recovered Skim-
mers: We partnered with the New York Police De-
partment’s (NYPD) Financial Crimes Task Force
and systematized the unique skimmers they iden-
tiﬁed across nearly 16 months. To the best of
our knowledge, our taxonomy is the ﬁrst large-
scale academic examination of real skimmers. We
then use this analysis to show that common advice
to consumers to detect skimmers is not effective
against modern skimming attacks.
• Develop Portable Detection Tool: We develop and
present the Skim Reaper, a card-shaped device for
detecting multiple read heads in a card slot. We ex-
plain the physics of reading magnetic stripe cards,
then show how these can be used to both effectively
detect read heads and prevent adversarial counter-
measures.
• Validate Tool Using Real Skimmers: We ﬁrst con-
ﬁrm the effectiveness of our system on a custom,

2.2 Fraud
Magnetic stripe cards offer no inherent protection from
duplication. All data contained on a card’s tracks are
written as plaintext, and an adversary with access to the
magnetic stripe (e.g., with a skimmer) can create a legit-
imate card. These cloned cards, while magnetically dis-
tinguishable from the originals [4, 48], contain the same
data as the originals.
To prevent the use of counterfeit cards, banks and pay-
ment networks added Card Veriﬁcation Values (CVVs).
CVV1 codes are part of the data on the magnetic stripe.
This code prevents the card from being cloned with only
knowledge of data printed on the physical card (e.g., the
account number). However, if the adversary has access
to read the card’s magnetic stripe, the CVV1 code is eas-
ily cloned along with the rest of the stripe data. CVV2
codes are printed on the physical card and are often re-
quested when making phone or online purchases (known
as “card not present transactions”). This code is intended
to prove possession of the original card. Adversaries can
either acquire this code by recording PIN entry with a
camera1, through sites that sell card data with codes, and
with compromised web browsers [35].
Once the adversary has obtained data and created a
counterfeit card, the cards are “cashed out.” When cash-
ing out, counterfeit cards are used to either purchase
goods (to be resold later) or to retrieve cash from an
ATM. Once purchases for a given card are declined, the
cards are discarded.
In the remainder of this paper, we focus on the prob-
lem of detecting acquisition of payment card data. With-
out this data, adversaries will be unable to perform card
fraud.
2.3 Common Advice
Card skimming is a well-known crime, and advice aimed
at protecting consumers is widespread. The most com-
mon suggestions are:
1. Look for signs of a skimmer.
2. Pull on the card reader.
3. Use a smartphone app to scan for skimmers with
Bluetooth radios.
4. Use an EMV (Chip) card.
5. Use cash.
While seemingly helpful on their surface, many of
these tips offer little in terms of speciﬁc steps. Beyond
common sense, Tips 1 and 2 suggest that users know how
payment devices should look and feel.
1Some credit and debit cards have the CVV2 printed on the face of
the card and (for cards with the code on the back) some card acceptors
allow the card to be inserted face down, allowing a camera with a view
of the card to capture the code.
Figure 1: F2F Encoding: A polarity transition per clock
cycle encodes a 0, whereas two encode a 1.
conspicuous 3D-printed skimmer. We then use 10
real-world skimmers to show that our system is ro-
bust against a wide variety of skimmer form factors.
The security of payment systems in general, and
ATMs in speciﬁc, has long been studied in Computer Se-
curity [11]. Many members of the public even argued
that such devices were already secure enough to use for
national elections (although signiﬁcant research in that
space disagreed with such an assertion [32, 47, 45]). Un-
fortunately, these systems remain signiﬁcantly vulnera-
ble and require continued attention.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 offers a primer on payment card readers and
fraud against those devices; Section 3 analyzes and cate-
gorizes the skimming devices found by the NYPD’s Fi-
nancial Crimes Task Force in 2017; Section 4 details the
design of the “Skim Reaper” detector; Section 5 pro-
vides experimental results against real recovered skim-
ming devices; Section 6 discusses countermeasures and
other insights; Section 7 examines related research; and
Section 8 gives our concluding remarks.
2 Fundamentals of Card Reading & Fraud
2.1 Magnetic Stripe Encoding
Magnetic stripes store small amounts of data using fre-
quency/double frequency (F2F) encoding. F2F stores
both the clock and the data, allowing a reader to quickly
synchronize and read the data when the card moves at
an inconsistent speed (such as when being swiped). Fig-
ure 1 shows how decoding is performed: when the mag-
netic polarity change occurs within a clock cycle, the
bit is a 1. Otherwise, it is a 0. Finally, the bitstream
is decoded into plaintext characters containing the card
data (e.g., name, account number, and expiration date).
Data is stored on up to three adjacent tracks on a single
stripe [29, 30], each having its own standard for character
encoding and density.

Table 1: The breakdown of skimmer BOLOs by the
NYPD Financial Crimes Task force between 2016-Jul-14
and 2017-Nov-11. ATMs were the most widely attacked
device using both deep-insert and overlay skimmers.
Tip 3 proposes the use of a smartphone-based app for
detecting Bluetooth radios. Of all of the above tips, this
is the most easily testable, and the strength of this tip can
be evaluated based on an analysis of the relative use of
Bluetooth radios by skimming devices.
Tip 4 suggests that users have the option to use a chip-
enabled card; however, EMV deployment is far from uni-
versal. For instance, less than 7% of ATMs in New York
City accept EMV [44], and ATMs in Europe with EMV
enabled continue to see an increase in skimmers [34].
This is because EMV-enabled cards have a magnetic
stripe as a backup, which attackers can still use to clone
card data.
Finally, Tip 5 requires that users essentially abandon
payment cards or fundamentally change their behaviors
(e.g., instead of paying at the pump, go inside the gas sta-
tion, wait in line and pay with cash). Security solutions
requiring signiﬁcant behavioral changes are unlikely to
be successful.
We will use our observations in the next section to fur-
ther evaluate Tips 1, 2, and 3.
3 Characterizing Real-World Skimmers
As we discussed, common advice for reducing the risk
of being a victim of skimming is pervasive. These argu-
ments are based on the detectability of single skimmer
models and not on a complete understanding of skim-
ming attacks. To the best of our knowledge, there has
been no systematization of real-world skimmers, leading
to a gap in our understanding of these devices and how
they continue to be successful despite this advice.
To gain a better understanding of the skimmers found
in practice, we partnered with the NYPD Financial
Crimes Task Force and obtained their skimmer BOLOs2
for the time ranging from 2016-Jul-14 to 2017-Nov-11.
The 35 memos we obtained provide the location, type,
and data retrieval method for unique skimmers discov-
ered during this time. Table 1 shows the breakdown of
each of the recovered skimmers. Multiple devices of the
same campaign do not result in an additional BOLO. As
a result, they provide clear insight into the variety of
skimming technology conﬁscated by police in the New
York City market. We explore these reports and perform
the ﬁrst large-scale characterization and breakdown of
skimmers.
3.1 Taxonomy
In the skimmers discovered by the NYPD, we found
ﬁve distinct installation points for skimmers in two cate-
gories: those that require only external access to the tar-
get device and those that require internal access. For ex-
ternal access, the skimmer can be installed without open-
ing the payment device3; for internal access, the payment
device must be opened (e.g., via key or drilling a hole).
We further divide these into skimmer types, which for
external-access skimmers consist of: those that ﬁt on the
magnetic stripe slot (overlays), those that ﬁt in the mag-
netic stripe slot (deep-inserts), those that ﬁt in the EMV
slot (shimmers), and those that ﬁt on the physical com-
munication line (wiretaps). Figure 2 provides a diagram
of an ATM with the placement of each type of skimmer.
3.1.1 External-Access Skimmers
Skimmers requiring no access to the internals of the tar-
get machine were the most common type of device re-
covered. These are the lowest-risk devices to deploy
since they can be installed in seconds [54] and are dif-
ﬁcult to identify without expertise.
Overlays were the most prevalent device discovered in
our data set, comprising nearly half (46%) of the skim-
mers. These devices are placed on top of the card slot
using a form factor custom-designed to match the target
machine. The rear side of the overlay contains a mag-
netic read head, decoding and storage equipment, and
a battery. Since the overlay sits atop the card accep-
tor, only millimeters exist between the new fac¸ade and
