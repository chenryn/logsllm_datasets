To effectively implement CIS Control 11.4, which focuses on establishing and maintaining an isolated instance of recovery data, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify Critical Data**: Determine which data is critical for the organization’s operations and requires protection and recoverability.

2. **Select Isolation Methods**: Choose appropriate methods to isolate the recovery data. Common options include:
   - **Offline Storage**: Use offline storage solutions such as external hard drives or tape backups.
   - **Cloud Storage**: Utilize secure cloud services that provide off-site data storage and isolation.
   - **Off-Site Storage**: Store data in a physically separate location, such as a secure data center or a third-party storage facility.

3. **Implement Version Control**: Ensure that backup destinations are version-controlled to maintain a history of changes and to facilitate easy restoration to a specific point in time.

4. **Regular Testing and Validation**: Regularly test and validate the recovery process to ensure that the isolated data can be successfully restored when needed.

5. **Document and Update Procedures**: Maintain detailed documentation of the recovery procedures and update them as necessary to reflect any changes in the organization’s IT environment or security policies.

CIS Control 11.4 is categorized under the asset type "Data" and falls under the security function "Recover." By following these steps, organizations can enhance their data protection and ensure business continuity in the event of a data loss incident.
