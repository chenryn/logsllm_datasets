User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why is raid-check using so little io bandwidth? Just out of curiosity, we have a RHEL server running software RAID. There's a cronjob which kicks off a raid data check every so often to check the consistency of the array. From my understanding, the data check will utilize idle IO bandwidth so as to not interfere with the server's normal operation.

As can be seen from the iostat output below, the server is virtually idle. Why is the raid data check only using 6M/sec of IO bandwidth? During the initial RAID build, I have seen these machines reach 320M/sec+. Why is the data check not utilizing 200MB/sec as indicated as the max bandwidth in the kernel log entry?

Below is the log output from when the raid data check was last started:

Apr 28 01:00:01 xxxx kernel: md: data-check of RAID array md1
Apr 28 01:00:01 xxxx kernel: md: minimum _guaranteed_  speed: 1000 KB/sec/disk.
Apr 28 01:00:01 xxxx kernel: md: using maximum available idle IO bandwidth (but not more than 200000 KB/sec) for data-check.
Apr 28 01:00:01 xxxx kernel: md: using 128k window, over a total of 3824596992k.
Apr 28 01:00:07 xxxx kernel: md: delaying data-check of md0 until md1 has finished (they share one or more physical units)


Here's some output of /proc/mdstat relating to md1:

Assistant: Take a look at /etc/sysconfig/raid-check.  This lets you set the ionice and nice parameters for this check.   The default is low, which nices down 5 and sets down the ionice.  You can adjust this in the setting i fyou don't like that and want to set it to use more resources (at the penalty of having it interfere more with normal jobs).
