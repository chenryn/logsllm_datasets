User: I went to tools, plugins. Then chose to install the three python items that show up. After installation. I choose the restart netbeans option. But instead of restarting, netbeans just closed. And now it is not opening. Any ideas how to fix this? I normally develop Java on my netbeans 7 install.
I am using a mac osx
I see there are no takers, so let me ask this: Is there a way to revert to before the new plugin install?
Assistant: I know I'm not answering your question directly, but I too was considering installing the Python plugin in Netbeans 7 but saw that it was still in Beta.  
I use WingIDE from wingware for Python development.  I'm a Python newbie but I'm told by the pros that Wing is the best IDE for Python.  The "101" version is free and works very well.  The licensed versions include more options such as version control integration and Django features.
