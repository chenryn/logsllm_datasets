Getting the following error upon loading:  
`Uncaught SyntaxError: Duplicate data property in object literal not allowed
in strict mode -- From line ... in .../bundle.js`
App runs well in modern browsers on PC/Mac, iOS UIWebview, mobile Safari,
Android (also 4.x) Chrome, and Android >5.x.
Consulting this table shows Android 4.4 supports ES5 well and should run
React.js applications just fine.
Any ideas?
