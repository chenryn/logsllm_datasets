Upon loading, I encountered the following error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Duplicate data property in object literal not allowed in strict mode
-- From line ... in .../bundle.js
```

The application runs smoothly on modern browsers for PC and Mac, as well as on iOS UIWebView, mobile Safari, and Android (including versions 4.x) Chrome, and Android versions 5.x and above. According to the compatibility table, Android 4.4 has good support for ES5 and should be able to run React.js applications without issues.

Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how to resolve this?
