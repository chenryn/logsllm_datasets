### Title: BlackHat Asia 2022: The Next Generation PlugX/ShadowPad? An In-Depth Analysis of the Emerging China-Nexus Modular Trojan, Pangolin8RAT

**Abstract:**

Modular malware, such as PlugX and ShadowPad, have been the most widely used trojans in Chinese state-sponsored cyber operations. Since mid-2020, TeamT5 has identified a new modular trojan, which we have named "Pangolin8RAT," emerging in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. This trojan is named after the PDB string "pangolin" and the RTTI "p8rat" found in its code.

**Key Features:**
- **Modular Design:** Pangolin8RAT's functionality can be extended by downloading additional DLLs from its command-and-control (C2) server.
- **Communication Protocols:** Initially, it supported eight communication protocols, including TCP, HTTPS, UDP, DNS, ICMP, HTTPSIPV6, WEB, and SSH. Recent versions have expanded this to more than eight protocols, indicating ongoing development.
- **Code Similarities:** We believe that Pangolin8RAT may be developed by the same group responsible for Winnti and FFRAT, based on similarities in their code structure.

**Potential Impact:**
Given its modular nature, evolving capabilities, and the observed development trajectory, we predict that Pangolin8RAT could become the next generation of shared or sold malware among Chinese threat groups, serving both espionage and financially motivated operations.

**Current Usage:**
As of now, Pangolin8RAT has not been widely distributed among multiple threat groups. It has been primarily associated with a Chinese APT group we track as "Tianwu." From 2020 to 2021, Tianwu has used Pangolin8RAT to target the online gaming/gambling industry, transportation, telecom, and government sectors in the APAC region.

**TTP Overlap:**
It is noteworthy that Tianwu shares some tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with the notorious APT41, particularly in their preference for targeting the online gambling/gaming industry.

**Presentation Overview:**
In this talk, we will provide a detailed timeline of Pangolin8RAT and Tianwu's activities from 2020 to 2021, along with our insights into the future development and potential impact of this emerging threat.

By examining the evolution and deployment of Pangolin8RAT, we aim to highlight the growing sophistication and adaptability of Chinese state-sponsored cyber operations, and the need for robust defensive measures to counter these threats.
