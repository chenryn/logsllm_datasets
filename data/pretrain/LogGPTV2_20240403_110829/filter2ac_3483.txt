title:blackhat:asia-22 The Next Gen PlugX/ShadowPad? A Dive into the Emerging China-Nexus Modular Trojan, Pangolin8RAT
Modular malware like PlugX and ShadowPad have been the most popular shared trojans used in Chinese state-sponsored cyber operations. Since mid-2020, TeamT5 has detected a new modular trojan emerging in the APAC region which has the potential to be their successor. We name this trojan "Pangolin8RAT" because its PDB string contains "pangolin" and its RTTI contains "p8rat." Pangolin8RAT is modular, as its functionalities can be expanded by downloading DLL from its C2. Its early feature supported 8 communication protocols, including TCP, HTTPS, UDP, DNS, ICMP, HTTPSIPV6, WEB, and SSH. Moreover, we believe this RAT is still under development as we observed its latest version supports more than 8 protocols. We also assess that this RAT is possibly developed by the developers of Winnti and FFRAT as we have observed similarities in their code structure. Given Pangolin8RAT's modular feature, code structure, and its on-going development, we predict that in the future, Pangolin8RAT is highly possible to be shared or even sold among Chinese threat groups for both espionage and financially driven operations, then transforming into the next generation PlugX/ShadowPad.Nevertheless, up to the present, Pangolin8RAT has yet to be widely shared among multiple threat groups. Pangolin8RAT has only been associated with a Chinese APT group we track as "Tianwu." From 2020 to 2021, we have observed Tianwu leveraging Pangolin8RAT to snipe at online gaming/gambling industry, transportation, telecom, and government in the APAC region. It is noteworthy that Tianwu has an overlapping TTP with the notorious APT41. Besides, both Tianwu and APT41 have preferences in targeting online gambling/gaming industry.In this talk, we will also give a brief attack timeline of Pangolin8RAT/Tianwu from 2020 to 2021 as well as our outlook on the group's future development.
