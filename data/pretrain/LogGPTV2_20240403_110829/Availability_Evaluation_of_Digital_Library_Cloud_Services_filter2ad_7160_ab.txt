From the mean time to failure obtained by the accelerated
test, it was possible to parameterize the RBD and SPN avail-
ability models explained in the previous section. In addition,
Table I presents the mean time to failures of the others com-
ponents used on the RBD models. In light of an architecture
depicted in Figure 2 (baseline), a RBD model was built.
Using an hierarchical approach, the front-end was modeled
at ﬁrst (See Figure 4). Then, the availability was calculated.
Next, the Node represented by digital library service (See
Figure 4) was modeled and its availability computed. Finally,
the composition of both models depicted in Figure 6 was

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
This section presents the results and discussions obtained
from the digital library cloud service described above. First the
failure rates under accelerated conditions were obtained. Then,
the availability of model was parameterized and an analysis
was performed. Based on this analysis, it was possible to
obtain the availability of the digital library service deployed in
the cloud computing. By analyzing the availability results, a
designer may verify the respective downtime as well as identify
the system parts that most affect the system availability.
A. Test Environment
This subsection describes the environment deployed. Three
computers with identical conﬁguration were adopted (CPU:
Intel i5 1.2 GHz, RAM: 2048 megabytes, NIC: 100 Mbps). A
computer was considered to generate the trafﬁc, other one to
be the Management cloud server (Front-end), and the third
to host the digital library service (Node). All of them are
interconnected via an Ethernet switch. The management server
adopts an open source project named OpenNebula [13]. The
considered digital library service was Dspace [14]. OpenNeb-
ula is a project aimed at providing features for management
of virtual machines and for private computing. Dspace is an
open source software for academic, non-proﬁt, and commercial
organizations creating open digital repositories.

performed. Table IV presents the availability and downtime
results. The downtime increases due to series composition, i.e.,
non-redundancy. Through the achieved results, the designer in
cloud computing environments can deﬁne service policies on
availability and thus comprise costs.

As of the ﬁrst results a designer may be able to use different
strategies in order to improve availability levels. Thus, two
redundant models were considered in two scenarios. A scenario
1 had availability level analyzed adding ColdStandby (Sc1.1)
and Hotstandby (Sc1.2) redundancy into the digital library
N ode. The baseline scenario has non-redundant mechanisms
meaning that just one V M was used to represent the digital
library service. Thus,
the proposed scenario aims to add
redundancy in digital library service and consequently increase
the availability levels. It is important to note that the scenario
reduces outages that
the service inaccessible causing
inconvenience to library users. Figure 9 shows the availability
analysis results of the scenario 1 in terms of number of nine’s
considering the environment without redundancy and adding
two redundant strategies in digital library service (Node). A
nine is the total number of consecutive nines in the percentage
calculation for availability. The second column represents
a coldstandby (Sc1.1) redundancy, i.e., the spare V M is
activated when a failure is registered in the main V M.
left
In addition, in the scenario 1 it was considered that a
copy of the V M would be continuously taken to ensure the
highest level of availability with the permanency of the service
running. The hotstandby (Sc1.2) model took into account two
digital library services (V M s) running in parallel. Aiming to
emphasize availability results, Table V presents the downtime
of each redundant model. Given its applicability, the model
hotstandby allows less downtime, however, a higher cost is
required.

Afterwards, scenario 2 considered redundancy in front-
670
ends whereas such thing wasn’t considered in the previous
scenario. Additionally, strategies with coldstandby (sc2.1) and
hotstandby (sc2.1) redundancy were considered for the front-
end. Figure 10 shows the availability results in number of
nines for each redundancy. According to the availability result,
the downtime difference between hot and cold redundant
strategies close to 87.4%. As the reader should notice, scenario
2 is more of an interesting option than scenario 1, since
it has less downtime values. However, a greater investment
in infrastructure is required, as well as the maintenance and
management of the environment.

Finally, scenario 3 takes into account a coldstandby re-
dundancy in front-end and digital service library (node). The
purpose of this scenario is to evaluate the availability levels
based on the range of the time to activate the spare redundancy.
Figure 11 presents the availability results considering the
number of nines. The availability results decreases along time
due to the increased time for the activation of the spare
redundancy.

These results can have signiﬁcant impact on the deﬁnition
of services in cloud computing environment, especially con-
cerning the conservation of scientiﬁc and literary knowledge,
as digital libraries are susceptible to mild or severe disruptions.
Therefore, it is expected that estimations generated from this
work will serve as a guide in decision-making of designers
implementing a particular solution of digital library to ensure
high availability.

view concerning digital library through the cloud computing.

The paper deﬁned concepts about cloud based architecture
on service, application and resource layer. Shaﬁ et al [17]
presents a review about how cloud computing can contribute
to digital and virtual library technologies. Some advantages
and disadvantages of cloud computing are outlined as a way
of saving cost of hardware and software maintenance and
the problematic condition related to security risk. Both works
focus in concepts and applicability of cloud computing for a
digital library.
Victor Jess [3] presented a ﬁle-storage service implemented
in a private/hybrid cloud-computing. The experiment analyzed
the response time in the elastic service considering compari-
son with ﬁxed conﬁguration. Furthermore, over response and
service time perceived during the ﬁle downloading process
using the private cloud. Weiming [18] proposed a platform
as a service for fast developing and deploying digital libraries.
According to the results, the engine ensures reliability, security,
extensibility, availability, quality of service and manageability.
In addition, the digital library was tested using the Chinese
Traditional Medicine, Literature Chronicle and Calligraphy
service.
In [19], a list of digital open source software was compared
considering different perspectives of features, functions and
usability. In the same way, Shakar [20] described a guide
for any organization or institute to decide which open source
digital library will be ideal for creating their digital collection.
Papadmapriya and Rajmohan [21] proposed a model for evalu-
ating quality of web service. The authors deﬁned attributes and
metrics for quality, aiming to perform an assessment of utility
and practicability considering three standards from IEEE 1061.
Wei et. al [22] uses an hierarchical method and proposes
the hybrid models combining reliability block diagrams and
general stochastic Petri nets. The results comprehend depend-
ability analysis of virtual data center in cloud computing
considering characteristics and mechanism of virtualization
such as backup and live migration. According to related
works, there are some researches concerning the advantages
and disadvantages of cloud computing, as well as, models to
analyze dependability of web services. However, almost no
work was conducted to explore the availability of digital library
services.
VI. CONCLUSION
This work presented an hierarchical modeling method to
analyze the availability of digital library management. In the
proposed approach an accelerated life testing model was used
in order to obtain the availability parameter. Furthermore, the
hierarchical model was created to estimate the availability
of the cloud computing architecture. Additionally, redundant
models were used intending to compare critical
levels of
availability taking into account quality services and preventing
outages.
The results for the digital library implement in cloud com-
puting employing different redundancy policies show that the
conclusions drawn from this paper can improve digital library
availability. As a future work, we plan to explore the impact
of different redundancy models including the costs associated
to each redundant module and live migration mechanism.
