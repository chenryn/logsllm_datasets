User: Say I have a file "main.py" and I just want it to run at 10 minute intervals, but not on my computer. The only external libraries the file uses are mysql.connector and pip requests.
Things I've tried:
PythonAnywhere - free tier is too limiting (need to connect to external DB)
AWS Lambda - Only supports up to Python 2.7, converted my code but still had issues
Google Cloud Platform + Heroku - can only find tutorials covering deploying applications, I think these could do what I'm looking for but I can't figure out how.
Thanks!
Assistant: Update: AWS does now support Python 3.6. Just select Python 3.6 from the runtime environments when configuring.
