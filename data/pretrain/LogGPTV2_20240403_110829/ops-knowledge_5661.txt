User: I have installed PIL with homebrew. It then says that there was a symlink error, and that is can be easily fixed by doing it again, but with a sudo. I did so. Now, when I go into python, and import Image, it doesn't work! I've tried import PIL, import image, import pil, and none of them work. When I try to install it again, it says Error: pil-1.1.7 already installed. Please help!
Assistant: I think you would see this issue if you were using the python binary that was not installed by homebrew along with a package that you did install via homebrew. Could you verify that the python binary you are using is not the one that was included in OS X by default?
