DDoS attack: refers to a distributed denial of service attack, which is an attack method that uses a large amount of garbage data to occupy the network resources of the target system and prevent it from working normally. Attackers use a large number of botnets or robot websites to initiate large-scale concurrent requests to the target website, causing the target system to overload and crash. 3.
