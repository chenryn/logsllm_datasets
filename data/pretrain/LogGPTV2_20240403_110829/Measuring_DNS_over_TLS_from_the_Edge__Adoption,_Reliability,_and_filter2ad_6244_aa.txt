## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental component of internet communication. DNS over TLS (DoT) was standardized in 2016 as an extension to the DNS protocol, but its performance has not been extensively studied. In this pioneering study, we measure DoT from the edge using 3,200 RIPE Atlas probes deployed in home networks. Each probe issues 200 domain name lookups to 15 public resolvers, five of which support DoT, and to their local resolvers over one week, resulting in 90 million DNS measurements. We find that the adoption of DoT among open resolvers has increased by 23.1% over nine months. However, only 0.4% of RIPE Atlas probes receive DoT responses from their local resolvers. In terms of reliability, DoT failure rates are 0.4–32.2 percentage points (p.p.) higher than those for DNS over UDP/53 (Do53). While Do53 failure rates are consistent across continents, DoT failure rates show significant variation. For response times, nearly all DoT requests take at least 100 ms due to connection and session establishment, resulting in response times more than 100 ms longer than Do53. Despite low local resolver adoption, DoT response times are around 140–150 ms, similar to public resolvers (130–230 ms), although with higher failure rates.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) faces various privacy-related issues, such as fingerprinting and tracking, which affect DNS over UDP/53 (Do53). To address these concerns, DNS over TLS (DoT) was standardized in 2016. This protocol establishes a TCP connection and TLS session on port 853, ensuring encrypted DNS message transmission to prevent eavesdropping and information exposure. Since its standardization, DoT has gained increasing support, including on Android devices as "Private DNS" since Android 9 (August 2018) and on Apple devices and services with iOS 14 (September 2020) and macOS Big Sur (November 2020).

Previous studies have examined DoT support and response times, but these were conducted from proxy networks and data centers, potentially leading to inaccurate latency estimates. Our study measures DoT from the end-user perspective using 3,200 RIPE Atlas home probes deployed across more than 125 countries. We issue DNS queries to 15 public resolvers, five of which support DoT, to compare the reliability and response times of Do53 and DoT resolvers. Our key findings include:

- **DoT Support (Section 2):** DoT support among open resolvers has increased by 23.1% compared to previous studies. TLS 1.3 support has increased by 15 p.p., while support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 is being phased out. Only 0.4% of RIPE Atlas probes receive DoT responses from their local resolvers.
- **DoT Failure Rates (Section 4):** Do53 failure rates are between 0.8–1.5%, while DoT failure rates range from 1.3–39.4%, or 0.4–32.2 p.p. higher. DoT failure rates vary significantly across continents, with higher values in Africa and South America. Most failures are due to timeouts, likely caused by middleboxes dropping packets destined for port 853.
- **DoT Response Times (Section 5):** DoT response times are generally within 130–230 ms, more than 100 ms slower than Do53, primarily due to additional TCP and TLS handshakes. Cloudflare exhibits consistent response times across regions, while other resolvers show high variability. When local resolvers support DoT, response times are comparable to those of faster public resolvers (140–150 ms) but still inflated compared to Do53.

We discuss limitations (Section 7) and compare our findings to previous work (Section 6) before concluding the study (Section 8). To facilitate reproducibility, we share the created RIPE Atlas measurement IDs, analysis scripts, and supplementary files. The measurements do not raise any ethical concerns.

## 2. DoT Background: Adoption and Traffic Share

### 2.1 DoT Adoption Among Open Resolvers
Deccio and Davis [8] studied the deployment of public DoT resolvers as of April 2019. They identified 1.2 million open DNS resolvers, with 0.15% (1,747) supporting DoT. Of these, 97% (1,701) supported TLS 1.2, and 4.5% (79) supported TLS 1.3. Older TLS versions (TLS 1.0 and 1.1) were not supported by 4.6% (80) of the resolvers. Lu et al. [26] found a similar number of open DoT resolvers (1.5k) in 2019.

We repeated this scan from a research network at TUM in January 2020, nine months after Deccio and Davis. We found that the number of open resolvers supporting DoT had increased to 2,151, a 23.1% increase. The share of resolvers supporting TLS 1.2 had increased to 99.9% (2,149 resolvers), and the percentage of TLS 1.3-supporting resolvers had increased to 20% (433). Older TLS versions were no longer supported by 508 resolvers (24%), indicating growing adoption of DoT and newer TLS implementations.

### 2.2 DoT Traffic Share
To assess DoT usage in terms of traffic, we analyzed public traffic traces from the WIDE backbone [7], which monitors a research network link in Japan. We aggregated daily traffic traces of 2019 by month and inspected the traffic share of DoT (TCP/853). DoT accounted for approximately 2 million out of 11.8 billion flows, or 0.017% of all flows. In contrast, Do53 traffic share was more than 135 times higher with 271.5 million flows (2.3%), indicating that DoT contributes a very small amount of overall traffic.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Measurement Platform and Probes
We used RIPE Atlas [32] to measure the reliability and response times of Do53 and DoT from distributed vantage points. DoT measurements were performed over TLS 1.2, as RIPE Atlas probes do not fully support TLS 1.3 yet. We selected IPv4-capable probes that correctly resolve A records through the RIPE Atlas API, excluding anchor probes to capture Do53 and DoT behavior for end users more accurately. We considered only V3 probes, ultimately finding 5,229 probes. For the analysis, we focused on residential probes, identified using RIPE Atlas user tags and traceroute measurements. Combining both approaches, we identified 3,231 home probes. Given the low number of dual-stacked residential probes (approximately 700 globally), we decided to focus on IPv4 measurements exclusively, although we suggest repeating the measurements over IPv6 with increased probe deployment.

### 3.2 DNS Resolvers
We issued the resolution of 200 domains (A records) to 15 selected IP endpoints of different public DNS services once a day, repeated over a week (July 03–09, 2019). Five of the 15 public DNS services (CleanBrowsing, Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and UncensoredDNS) support DoT. We also issued the same DNS lookups to these services using DoT for comparison. Additionally, we queried the same 200 domains using the DNS resolvers provided by each probe's network configuration, referred to as local resolvers (typically operated by ISPs and assigned via DHCP). Among the 2,718 probes that received at least one successful Do53 response from a local resolver, 2,257 used an endpoint in their private network (e.g., a CPE), and 572 used an ISP resolver (public IP address) for local name resolution. We did not observe significant differences in response times at the 5th percentile (9.5 ms for CPE, 9.8 ms for ISP resolver).

### 3.3 Domains
The 200 queried domains included 150 websites from the Alexa Top 1M list, split into 10 equally-sized bins of 100,000 each, with the first 15 domains selected from each bin. The remaining 50 domains were selected from country-based Alexa Toplists, focusing on 10 countries with high numbers of probes (US, DE, GB, RU, NL, IT, JP, NZ, ZA, BR).
