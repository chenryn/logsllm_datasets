Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    function truncate(str, num) {
      if (str.length  num) {
        str = str.slice(0,num-3).concat("...");
      }
      // Clear out that junk in your trunk
      return str;
    }
    truncate("A-1", 2);
Hi! This code passes when it shouldn't. The challenge asks for users to
truncate if str.length is longer than num.length, but this configuration
truncates str as long as it is shorter than 3 characters, regardless of the
length of num. This could be resolved by making another test parameter
truncate("A-", 2) which does not truncate.
