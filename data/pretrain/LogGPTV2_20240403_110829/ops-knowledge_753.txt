User: I'm using the multiprocessing module to do parallel processing in my program.  When I'm testing it, I'll often want to kill the program early when I notice a bug, since it takes a while to run to completion.  In my Linux environment, I run my program from a terminal, and use Ctrl+C to kill it.  With multiprocessing, this causes all the processes to be killed, but I never get the bash prompt back, and have to close the terminal and open a new one (and navigate back to my working directory) which is quite annoying.  Is there any way to get around this?
Assistant: Hit Ctrl-Z to suspend the Python process, then do kill %1 to kill it.  You can also just hit Ctrl-\ (backslash), but that may cause the process to leave a core file.
