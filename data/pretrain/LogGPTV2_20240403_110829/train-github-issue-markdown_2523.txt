### Expected Behavior
When opening a dialog, such as About, VoiceOver should be able to read and
interact with it and its controls.
### Actual Behavior
VoiceOver does not see dialog contents in many cases.
### To Reproduce
  1. Download and install Visual Studio code.
  2. Start VoiceOver, then Code.
  3. Go to Visual Studio Code/About, and press Enter.
  4. Try interacting with the dialog and read the contents, or navigate to the OK and Copy buttons using VoiceOver commands.
### Screenshots
### Additional Information
VoiceOver will track the focus somewhat, but not reliably, when using the Tab
key to navigate. But VoiceOver commands such as CTRL+Option+Arrow keys don't
work, VoiceOver only sees the Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons.
This looks similar to #17207, only that this pertains to dialogs, not web
content.
