### Additional Information
In the borderless windows of windows computers, the minimum window width is
800. Drag it to the place where the minimum window cannot be dragged, that is,
the window width is 800. Click our customized maximize button. Does the
maximize button change the restore button? Click the restore button. It is
found that the window has not been restored. The window width may be 814
instead of 800. You can still drag it to the left. Wechat pin can do it,
vscode can't.
