your organization, ensuring that securing is not just responsibility of operations,
instead, security should be built-in inside applications.
AWS Security Best Practices
[ 221 ]
Amazon Inspector: Use an agent-based security assessment, such as an AWS
Inspector for your web applications and for servers that are used to run these
web applications. It has built-in rule packages to identify common vulnerabilities
for various standards and benchmarks. You can automate security responses by
configuring APIs of Amazon Inspector. You should regularly run these
assessments to ensure there isn't any security threat as per the existing
configuration for your web application and servers.
Penetration testing: AWS allows you to conduct vulnerability and penetration
testing for all your EC2 instances. You need to request the AWS console and AWS
support to conduct these tests in advance before you actually conduct them.
Utilize AWS security tools: AWS provides several tools for encryption and key
management such as KMS and cloud hardware security module, firewalls such as
web application firewall, AWS shield, security groups, and NACLs, and so on.
Integrate your application with these tools to provide greater security and threat
protection.
Monitoring, logging, and auditing
Let us look at best practices for monitoring, logging, and auditing in AWS:
Log everything: AWS provides AWS CloudTrail that logs all API activities for
your AWS account. Enable this service for all regions and create a trail to audit
these activities whenever required. Take advantage of the AWS cloud-native
logging capabilities for all AWS services. Collect, store, and process logs for
infrastructure such as VPC flow logs, AWS services, and logs for your
applications to ensure continuous monitoring and continuous compliance. Use
CloudWatch Logs to process all log data, and S3 for storing it.
Enable AWS CloudWatch: Ensure that you are using AWS CloudWatch to
monitor all your resources in AWS including data, services, servers, applications,
and other AWS native tools and features such as ELBs, auto scaling groups, and
so on. Use metrics, dashboards, graphs, and alarms to create preventive solutions
for security incidents.
Continuous compliance: Use AWS Trusted Advisor to proactively check for
issues related to security configuration of your AWS resources. Set up a pre-
defined inventory for all your hardware and software resources including
versions and configurations in the AWS service catalog to provide a guardrail for
your users, helping them to choose only compliant resources for their workloads.
Use AWS Config to notify the user in real time about changes in configuration
from their pre-defined configuration of resources.
AWS Security Best Practices
[ 222 ]
Automate compliance and auditing: Use combinations of AWS CloudTrail, AWS
SNS, AWS Lambda, AWS Config Rules, CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Alerts,
Amazon Inspector, and so on to automate compliance and auditing for all
resources and all workloads deployed in your AWS account.
AWS CAF
AWS CAF helps organizations migrating to cloud computing in their cloud adoption
journey by providing best practices and guidance through this framework. It breaks down
this guidance into manageable areas of focus for building cloud-based systems that can be
mapped to individual units of organizations. These focus areas are known as perspectives,
there are six of these. Each perspective is further broken into components.
There are three perspectives, each for business (business, people, and governance) and
technology (platform, security, and operations) stakeholders as shown in the following
figure:
Figure 3 - AWS Cloud Adoption Framework perspectives
Each perspective is made up of responsibilities owned by one or more stakeholders known
as CAF capabilities. These capabilities are standards, skills, and processes that define what
is owned and/or managed by these stakeholders for their organizations cloud adoption
journey. You would map these capabilities with roles within your organizations and
identify gaps in your existing stakeholder, standards, skills, and processing towards your
cloud journey.

Security perspective
The security perspective provides guidance for aligning organizational requirements 
relating to security control, resilience, and compliance for all workloads developed and
deployed in AWS cloud. It lists out processes and skills required for stakeholders to ensure
and manage security in cloud. It helps you select security controls and structure them as per
your organization's requirements to transform the security culture in your organization.
The security perspective has capabilities that target the following roles in an organization:
Chief Information Security Officer, IT Security Managers, IT Security Analysts, Head of
Audit and Compliance, and all resources in Auditing and Compliance roles.
The security perspective consists of the following four components:
Directive component
This component provides guidance to all stakeholders that are either operating or
implementing a security controls in your environment on planning your security approach
for migrating to the AWS cloud. It includes controls, such as security operations playbook
and runbooks, least privilege access, data locality, change and asset management, and so
on. The directive component includes activities such as monitoring the teams through
centralized phone and email distribution lists, integrating development, security, and
operations teams roles and responsibilities to create a culture of DevSecOps in your
organizations. 
Preventive component
This component is responsible for providing guidance for implementing a security
infrastructure within your organization and with AWS. You should enable your security
teams to build skills such as automation, deployment for securing your workloads in agile,
dynamic, elastic, and scalable cloud environments. This component builds on identification
of security controls as identified in the directive component. In this component, you learn to
work with these controls, for example, you will look at your data protection policies and
procedures and tweak them if required. Similarly, you will revisit your identity and access
measures and infrastructure protection measures too. Consider establishing a minimum
security baseline as part of this component.
AWS Security Best Practices
[ 224 ]
Detective component
This component deals with logging and monitoring to help you gain visibility into the
security posture of your organization. Logging and monitoring along with events analysis,
testing will give you operational agility as well as transparency for security controls you
have defined and operate regularly. This component includes activities such as security
testing, asset inventory, monitoring and logging, and change detection. You should
consider defining your logging requirements keeping AWS native logging capabilities in
mind alongside conducting vulnerability scans and penetration testing as per AWS pre-
defined process.
Responsive component 
This chapter guides you to respond to any security events for your organization by
incorporating your existing security policies with AWS environment. It guides you to
automate your incident response and recovery processes thereby enabling you to provide
more resources toward performing forensics and root cause analysis activities for these
incidents. It includes activities such as forensics, incident response, and security incident
response simulations. You should consider updating and automating your school responses
as per the AWS environment and validating them by running simulations.
Summary
In this chapter, we went over security best practices for all the topics we have covered in all
previous chapters, such as IAM, VPC, security of data, security of servers, and so on.
Throughout this chapter, we have focused on and emphasized on security automation by
utilizing AWS native services, tools, and features. AWS security best practices echo similar
recommendations as well to create a software-defined, self-healing environment by using
AWS-managed services instead of building something manually.
We also learnt about AWS CAF, that is used by hundreds of organizations to help them
migrate to cloud in their cloud journey. We deep dived into the security perspective of this
framework and learnt about four components of security perspective that will help us
secure our workloads while migrating to the AWS cloud.
