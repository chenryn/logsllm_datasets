### Title: BotConf 2022 - Into the Silent Night: Unveiling Zloader's Resurgence

**Abstract:**

Since December 2019, Zloader has re-emerged under the guise of "Silent Night," and it has been employed in various attack campaigns, notably PseudoGate and Malsmoke. These campaigns primarily target users in Japan, Canada, and the United States, with the aim of exfiltrating banking-related information.

Zloader communicates with its Command and Control (C&C) servers using HTTPS and domain names generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). This sophisticated method makes it challenging to detect Zloader's network activities through traditional means.

To address this, we have developed a system that collects and analyzes data from logs on Zloaderâ€™s C&C servers. To identify these C&C servers, we gathered Zloader samples and extracted their internal configuration data using several public services. Our system has been operational since March 2021, continuously monitoring all Zloader C&C servers across multiple attack campaigns. This allows us to track the scale of Zloader infections on a daily basis for each campaign.

In this presentation, we will first provide an overview of Zloader's key characteristics. We will then delve into the details of our Zloader investigation system, including its architecture and operational capabilities. Additionally, we will share the insights and data collected by the system, along with our analysis and considerations derived from this data.

This presentation aims to equip Security Operations Centers (SOCs), Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), and security researchers with a deeper understanding of Zloader, enabling them to develop more effective countermeasures against this threat.

**Key Points:**
- **Resurgence of Zloader as "Silent Night"**
- **Targeted Attack Campaigns: PseudoGate and Malsmoke**
- **Geographical Focus: Japan, Canada, and the U.S.**
- **Communication Method: HTTPS and DGA-generated Domains**
- **Development and Operation of the Zloader Investigation System**
- **Data Collection and Analysis from C&C Servers**
- **Insights and Considerations for Security Professionals**

By sharing these findings, we hope to enhance the collective defense against Zloader and similar threats.
