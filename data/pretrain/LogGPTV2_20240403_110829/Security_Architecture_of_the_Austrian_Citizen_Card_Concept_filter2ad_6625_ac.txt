### 4. Austrian Citizen Card Concept

With the EU's initiatives towards an information society, particularly through the eEurope action plans [22], which emphasize the use and deployment of smart cards, and the EU Signature Directive, several smart card initiatives have emerged in Europe. These include the "eEurope Smartcard Charter," which aims to accelerate and harmonize the use of smart cards across Europe. Additionally, various national initiatives, such as citizen ID cards, have been launched.

Having discussed the requirements for e-Government in Section 2 and the underlying legal provisions that enable e-Government in Section 3, we now present Austria’s technological implementation of its security infrastructure: the Austrian citizen card.

The term "citizen card" might suggest a single, highly detailed class of smart-card-like devices. However, for reasons of technology independence and openness to market solutions, the Austrian citizen card is more of a concept that can take various forms. For example, the health insurance card, which was rolled out to all Austrian citizens by 2004, is one such form. Another is the public identity card, available as a smart card since 2002. Other forms include a member card for the Austrian Computer Society, SSCDs (Secure Signature Creation Devices) provided by CSPs (Certification Service Providers) issuing qualified certificates, and bank cards for automated teller machines, which are expected to follow the citizen card concept by 2004.

To be considered an "Austrian citizen card," these different solutions must meet a set of general requirements specified by the Austrian CIO office [23]. These requirements include both mandatory functions and recommendations:

- **Qualified Signature**: The card must support a qualified signature (referred to as a "secure electronic signature" in the Austrian Signature Law), which meets the legal requirements of a handwritten signature. While any signature suite compliant with the Austrian Signature Order can be used, DSA variants based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) are recommended.
- **Additional Key Pairs**: At least one additional key pair should be implemented for content encryption or non-qualified electronic signatures, where equivalence to handwritten signatures is not required. ECC is again recommended.
- **Info-Boxes**: Accessible memory (info-boxes) must be available for storing data such as certificates and persona binding.
- **Access Control**: Access to info-boxes must be controlled, with separate read and write access rights. Access methods include:
  - Access after confirmation: The citizen confirms an indication given in the card environment.
  - Access after identification: Access is granted after the citizen is identified, such as by entering a PIN or using biometrics.
  - Unconditional access.
- **Specific Info-Boxes**: A set of info-boxes required for e-Government applications must be implemented, including:
  - Mandates: Powers of attorney stored with certificates for key pairs.
  - Persona binding (see Section 3.2).
  - Links: If memory capacity is a concern, links to data stored in the card environment may be provided.
- **Session Key Negotiation**: The card must implement a Diffie-Hellman session key exchange.

Given these basic requirements, the authors developed a concept to combine the actual implementation into a single entity called the "Security Capsule" and define an open interface to this entity, known as the "Security Layer." This concept is discussed in the following section.

### 5. Security Capsule and Security Layer

From an architectural perspective, the openness to different technological implementations, which has led to a significant number of actual instantiations of the "Austrian citizen card" concept, has two major pitfalls:
1. **Responsibility and Liability**: If various solutions enable different combinations of security-relevant components, responsibility and liability become unclear.
2. **Application Tailoring**: e-Government cannot afford to maintain this openness if each application needs to be tailored to specific solutions that slightly deviate from the general requirements of a citizen card.

#### 5.1 Security Capsule

The idea behind the security capsule is to separate the responsibility for security-relevant function blocks from the application and encapsulate them. The Austrian Signature Law already establishes certain liabilities for CSPs regarding qualified signatures. However, the citizen card concept adds further security features, such as info-boxes and Diffie-Hellman exchanges, which are not under the primary responsibility of the CSP.

To achieve a straightforward architecture, the security capsule is a requirement that the qualified signature functions, along with the additional citizen card requirements, must be implemented in a self-contained component. This component may consist of a smart card and its IT environment, including the card acceptor device, secure PIN entry, and even programs and hard-disk memory of the PC for storing info-boxes or implementing key exchange functions. Key pairs, except those for qualified signatures, may be stored in PC memory, although a smart card would also be a suitable place. With developments like the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA), it is not unrealistic to expect solutions where sensitive information can be securely stored on-board the PC, such as with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) [24].

Figure 4 illustrates a scenario where the security capsule stores information in both the smart card and the PC. The security capsule holds two SCDs (private keys), one for qualified electronic signatures and one for the second key pair. In this example, the smart card holds data requiring high protection against disclosure, such as private keys and the info-box holding the persona binding. Corresponding certificates are linked to the PC’s memory. The figure also depicts an info-box holding a mandate, such as an XML record signed by the person delegating powers of attorney. The security capsule implements functions that need to be confirmed by a designated body under the signature law, as shown by a PIN pad and a viewer component (see Figure 2).

#### 5.2 Security Layer

From the perspective of an e-Government application, security functions can be delegated to the security capsule. The application does not need to be aware of implementation details, such as the signature suite used or the interfaces to the smart card. The application requires a few basic security-related functions:

- **Signature Creation**: Once a document is created, the application can request a signature. The application selects a signature format, such as Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [26] or XMLDSIG [19], and passes the document to the security capsule. The entire signature-creation process, including document viewing and PIN entry, is carried out by the capsule, which returns the signed data or an indication of failure.
- **Session Certificates**: The security layer offers functions to create session keys and session certificates, allowing for secure client-server communication, such as using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [27].
- **Signature Verification**: Given a signed document, the application passes the signed data to the security capsule. The capsule verifies the signature, retrieves certificate status information (e.g., from a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)), and returns the result.
- **Info-Box Access**: The application can read and write info-boxes, with the security functions, such as enforcing access control policies, delegated to the security capsule.
- **Status Information**: The security capsule provides status information, such as the smart card status, lists of implemented info-boxes, and supported functions.

The security layer, specified in [28], is an interface that implements a request-response scheme with XML-encoded data representation. For maximum flexibility, various protocols (referred to as "transport layer bindings") have been defined to communicate these XML structures between the application and the security capsule. These include Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), TLS, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and HTTPS. In the latter two, the security layer acts as a rudimentary web server accessible by web browsers, allowing the use of HTML forms and redirects without requiring additional active components on the client side.

The main advantages of the security capsule and security layer concept are:
- **Focused Trust**: Security-wise, the trust is focused on a single component, ensuring high confidence in the quality of security measures.
- **Forward Compatibility**: Technological advancements can be integrated into a single component, maintaining compatibility and ease of updates.

We have specified the security layer as a common interface for the Austrian citizen card concept and implemented a prototype security capsule as a test and development platform for e-Government applications. The prototype supports various signature algorithms (such as RSA and ECC) and hash functions, and is implemented in Java for platform independence.

### 6. Applications and Timeline

Finally, we discuss how e-Government applications make use of the security architecture. Two aspects are important:
