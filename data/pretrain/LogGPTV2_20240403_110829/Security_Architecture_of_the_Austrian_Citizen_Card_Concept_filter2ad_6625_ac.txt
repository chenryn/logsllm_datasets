such as registered letters. In case the delivery server is not 
operated by the public authority itself, for data protection 
reasons  the  notification  needs  to  be  encrypted  by  the 
authority  under  a  citizen’s  public  key.  In  that  case,  the 
fallback  to  conventional  delivery  needs  to  be  carried  out 
by  the  public  authority  which  is  in  possession  of  the 
plaintext notification. 
4. Austrian citizen card concept 
With the EU initiatives towards an information society, 
in  particular  the  eEurope  action  plans  [22]  having  usage 
and  deployment  of  smart-cards  as  one  major  action  line, 
as  well  as  with  the  EU  signature  directive,  a  number  of 
smart-card initiatives showed up in Europe. Among these 
are  the  “eEurope  smartcard  charter”  elaborating  ways  to 
accelerate  and  harmonize  the  use  of  smart-cards  across 
Europe.  Moreover,  several  national  initiatives  such  as 
citizen ID cards have been launched4.  
Having  discussed  the  requirements  for  e-Government 
in  section  2  and  the  underlying  legal  provisions  that 
enable  e-Government  in  section  3,  we  continue  with  the 
presentation of Austria’s technological implementation of 
its security infrastructure – the Austrian citizen card.  
Given  the  name  ‘citizen  card’  one  might  assume  a 
single  class of smart-card like devices which is specified 
in a high grade of details. This in fact is not the case: for 
concerns  of  technology  independence  and  openness  for 
solutions provided by the market, the Austrian citizen card 
is rather a concept that will show a variety of appearances. 
The health insurance card which roll-out to each Austrian 
citizen  shall  be  completed  in  2004  is  one  of  these 
appearances.  The  public  identity  card  that  will  be 
available as a smart-card in 2002 is another one. Further 
citizen  cards  will  be  a  member  card  of  the  Austrian 
computer  society,  or  SSCDs  shipped  by  CSPs  that  issue 
qualified  certificates.  It  is  also  expected  that  bank  cards 
for automated teller machines will follow the citizen card 
concepts in 2004.  
What  the  different  solutions  that  have  been  sketched 
above  have  in  common  is,  that  in  order  to  be  ‘Austrian 
citizen  cards’  they  need  to  follow  a  set  of  general 
requirements. These requirements have been specified by 
the  Austrian  CIO  office  [23]  and  consist  of  mandatory 
functions and recommendations, as follows:  
•  Qualified  signature:  The  qualified  signature  (called 
‘secure  electronic  signature’  in  the  Austrian  signature 
law),  i.e.  an  electronic  signature  that  fulfills  the 
requirements 
to  a 
handwritten  signature,  must  be  supported.  While  any 
signature  suite  eligible  according  to  the  Austrian 
signature  order  can  be  implemented,  DSA  variants 
based  on  elliptic  curve  cryptography  (ECC)  are 
recommended. 
to  be  considered  equivalent

•  Additional key pairs: At least one additional key pair 
shall  be  implemented,  that  can  be  used  for  content 
encryption  or  for  electronic  signatures  that  are  not 
considered qualified signatures, e.g. in cases where the 
equivalence  to  handwritten  signatures  is  not  required. 
Again ECC is recommended.  
•  Info-boxes:  So  called  info-boxes  must  be  accessible. 
Info-boxes  are  memory  for  storing  data  such  as 
certificates, or the persona binding.  
•  Access  control:  Access  to  the  info-boxes  must  be 
controlled.  It  must  be  possible  to  assign  access  rights 
for  each  info-box  separately.  Read  access  and  write 
access  needs  to  be  assigned  separately.  The  access 
rights must include  
- 
access  after  confirmation:  the  citizen  confirms  an 
indication given in the environment of the card 
access after identification: access is granted, after 
the citizen has been identified, such as by entering 
a PIN or by using biometrics

the  citizen  card  for  concerns  of  convenience,  this 
might  exhaust  the  memory  capacity.  Therefore, 
links  to  data  stored  in  the  environment  of  the 
citizen card may be provided.  
•  Session  key  negotiation:  The  citizen  card  must 
implement a Diffie-Hellman session key exchange. 
Given  these  basic  requirements  the  concept  that  has 
been developed by the authors was to combine their actual 
implementation  to  a  single  entity  which  we  call  the 
‘Security Capsule’ and to define an open interface to this 
entity which is called the ‘Security Layer’. This concept is 
discussed in the following section.  
5. Security capsule and security layer  
From  an  architectural  perspective, 
the  openness 
towards  different  technological  implementations  that  has 
been  highlighted  in  the previous section and that already 
has led to a significant number of actual instantiations of 
the concept ‘Austrian citizen card’ has two major pitfalls: 
on  the  one  hand,  if  various  solutions  enable  various 
combinations  of  the  security-relevant  components  to  be 
assessed under the signature law (cf. section 3.1, figure 2), 
responsibility  and  liability  becomes  inscrutable.  On  the 
other  hand,  e-Government  can  not  effort  to  keep  that 
openness,  if  each  application  needs  to  be  tailored  to  any 
specific solution that fulfils the general requirements of a 
citizen  card  as  discussed  in  section  4,  but  with  slight 
deviations  regarding  the  signature  suites,  interfaces,  etc. 
These aspects are discussed in the following sub-sections. 
5.1 Security capsule 
The  idea  behind  the  security  capsule  is  that  the 
responsibility  for  the  security-relevant  function  blocks 
shall  be  separated  from  the  application  and  shall  be 
encapsulated.  For  the  qualified  signature,  the  Austrian 
signature  law  already  lays  down  a  certain  liability  of  the 
CSP.  However, 
in  addition  to  the  security-relevant 
functions for qualified signatures that have been sketched 
in  section  3.1,  the  citizen  card  concept  adds  further 
security  features  which  are  per  se  not  under  the  primary 
responsibility of the CSP. Examples are the info-boxes or 
the Diffie-Hellman exchange.  
In order to achieve a straight-forward architecture, the 
security  capsule  is  a  requirement  that  the  qualified 
signature  functions,  together  with  the  additional  citizen 
card  requirements,  need  to  be  implemented  in  a  self-
contained  component  – 
the  security  capsule.  This 
component  may  consist  of  a  smart-card  together  with  its 
IT  environment,  such  as  the  card  acceptor  device, 
provisions  for  secure  PIN  entry,  and  even  programs  and 
hard-disk memory of the PC for storing info-boxes that do 
not reside on the smart-card or for implementing the key 
exchange  functions.  Even  key  pairs  –  except  those  for 
qualified  signatures  –  may  be  stored  in  PC  memory, 
although  obviously  a  smart-card  would  also  be  the  place 
desired 
that  with 
developments  such  as  the  trusted  computer  platform 
alliance  (TCPA)  it  is  not  fictitious  to  expect  solutions 
showing  up 
the  market  where  such  sensitive 
information may also be securely stored on-board the PC, 
such as with a trusted platform module (TPM) [24].  
information.  Note, 
to  store  such 
in 
Figure  4  illustrates  a  scenario  where  the  security 
capsule  stores  information  in  both  the  smart-card  and  in 
the  PC.  The  security  capsule  holds  two  SCDs  (private 
keys), one for qualified electronic signatures and one for 
the  second  key  pair.  In  that  certain  example,  the  smart-
card  holds  just  a  set  of  data  requiring  a  high  level  of 
protection against disclosure, i.e. the private keys (SCDs) 
and  the  info-box  holding  the  persona  binding.  The 
corresponding  certificates  are  given  by  links  to  the 
environment  –  the  PC’s  memory.  In  addition,  figure  4 
depicts an info-box holding a mandate, e.g. a XML record 
signed  by  the  person  delegating  the  powers  of  attorney. 
The  security  capsule  further  implements  those  functions 
that need to be confirmed by a designated body under the 
signature law. This is sketched by a PIN pad and a viewer 
component (cf. figure 2).

Note  that  from  a  security  perspective,  gluing  together 
the  security-relevant  components  to  one  logical  entity  – 
the  security  capsule  –  does  not  eliminate  the  problems 
addressed  in  section  3.1.  Still  the  communication  path 
between the PIN-pad and the SSCD needs to be secured, 
the  DTBS  (the  hash  value)  may not be tampered with in 
transit, or a trusted viewer is needed. I.e. countermeasures 
to  these  threats  still  need  to  be  in  place,  such  as  card 
acceptor  devices  including  a  PIN  pad  and  which  e.g.  is 
capable  of  secure  messaging  as  defined  in  [25].  What  is 
gained in the concept is that these aspects are transparent 
to  the  application.  For  the  application  accessing  the 
security capsule it is invisible whether data structures are 
kept in the smart-card, whether complex structures divide 
the  functions  between  the  smart-card  and  the  PC,  or  no 
smart-card  is  used  at  all,  but  e.g.  a  HSM  holds  critical 
data.  We  call  this  transparent  behavior  of  the  security 
capsule a ‘logical view’ to the citizen card. The interface 
that  implements  that  logical  view  is  called  security  layer 
and is discussed in the following sub-section.  
5.2 Security layer 
From  the  perspective  of  an  e-Government  application 
the  security-functions  can  be  delegated  to  the  security 
capsule.  The  application  does  not  be  aware  of 
implementation  details,  such  as  which  signature  suite  is 
used,  the  interfaces  to  the  smart-card,  and  alike.  The 
application  needs  a  few  basic  security–related  functions, 
as follows:  
•  Signature-creation:  Once  a  document  has  been 
created,  the  application  can  request  to  create  a 
signature.  The  application  selects  a  signature  format 
•  Session  certificates:  The 
security 
layer  offers 
functions  to  create  session  keys  and  to  create  session 
certificates.  This  allows  securing  the  client-server 
communication  such  as  by  using  transport  layer 
security (TLS) [27].  
such  as  cryptographic  message  syntax  (CMS)  [26]  or 
XMLDSIG  [19],  and  passes  the  document  to  the 
security capsule. The whole signature-creation process 
–  including  document  viewing  and  PIN-entry  –  is 
carried  out  by  the  capsule  which  returns  the  signed 
data,  an  indication  that  the  signatory  did  not  sign  or 
that the signature-creation process failed, respectively.  
•  Signature-verification: Given a signed document, the 
application  passes  the  signed  data  to  the  security 
capsule.  The  signature-verification  which  includes 
retrieving certificate status information – e.g. provided 
by  a  certificate  revocation  list  (CRL)  or  online 
certificate  status  protocol  (OCSP)  –  is  carried  out  by 
the security capsule and the result is returned.  
•  Info-box  access:  The  application  can  read  and  write 
info-boxes. Again the security functions, i.e. enforcing 
the access control policy, are delegated to the security 
capsule.  
•  Status  information:  Status  information,  such  as  the 
smart-card  status,  lists  of  implemented  info-boxes,  or 
the functions that are supported by the capsule.  
The security layer which has been specified [28] is an 
interface  that  implements  a  request-response  scheme 
where  the  data  representation  is  encoded  in  XML.  For 
concerns  of  maximum  flexibility,  a  variety  of  protocols 
have been specified communicating these XML structures 
between the application and the security capsule. We refer 
to  these  protocols  as  ‘transport  layer  bindings’.  The 
transport  layer  bindings  include  transmission  control 
protocol;  internet  protocol  (TCP/IP)  where  the  security 
layer  acts  as  TCP  server  and 
is 
communicated  via  TCP  sockets.  Moreover  secure  socket 
layer (SSL) and TLS, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), 
and HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) have been defined. In the 
latter  two,  the  security  layer  acts  as  a  rudimentary  Web-
server that can be accessed by Web browsers. This allows 
that  besides  the  security  layer  no  active  components  are 
required  with  the  client  application,  which  usually  is  a 
conventional Web browser. Techniques such as hypertext 
markup language (HTML) forms and HTML redirects are 
employed, as will be discussed in section 6.  
the  XML  data 
The  main  advantages  of  the  concept  of  a  security 
capsule implementing the security relevant functions and a 
security layer as an open interface using open protocols is, 
that security-wise the trust required is focused to a single 
component.  With 
the  evaluation  and  confirmation 
requirements laid down in the signature order for qualified 
signatures, together with quality seals for security capsule 
implementations,  the  citizens  get  a  high  degree  of
