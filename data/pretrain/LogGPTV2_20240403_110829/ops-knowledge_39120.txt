User: In terms of application monitoring, how to use Prometheus and Grafana to collect and display indicators? Please provide an actual case and the design of related monitoring items.
Assistant: Practical case: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana on a web application for indicator monitoring. Design of monitoring items: 1. Application internal information: HTTP request response time, request volume, error rate, number of connections, CPU utilization, memory utilization and other information. 2. System information: CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space utilization and other information. 3. Database information: number of connections, response time, slow query and other information. 4. Docker container information: container startup time, running status, memory and CPU utilization and other information. 5. Network information: network load, traffic, packet loss rate and other information. Based on the above monitoring items, we can design the following indicator collection and display process: 1. Install the required Exporter in the application, such as: Node Exporter, MySQL Exporter, Docker Exporter, Blackbox Exporter. 2. Configure Prometheus to collect the indicator data provided by the Exporter, and periodically grab the indicator data. 3. Create a Dashboard in Grafana to display the collected data, and set corresponding thresholds and alert rules. 4. Set up alarm notifications as required to remind administrators or developers to deal with them in time when abnormalities occur. In this way, we can comprehensively monitor the web application, and repair and optimize it in time when an abnormality occurs, so as to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
