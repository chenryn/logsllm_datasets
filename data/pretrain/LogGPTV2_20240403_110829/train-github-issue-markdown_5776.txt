### Describe the issue:
Functions often accepts any ndarray as long as the elements are numbers. Using
`npt.NDArray[np.number]` creates many mypy/pyright errors as none of the
operators seems to be annotated for it.
### Reproduce the code example:
    import numpy as np
    import numpy.typing as npt
    def foo(x: npt.NDArray[np.number]):
        x * 1
        x * x
### Error message:
    error: Unsupported operand types for * ("ndarray[Any, dtype[number[Any]]]" and "int")  [operator]
    error: Unsupported operand types for * ("ndarray[Any, dtype[number[Any]]]" and "ndarray[Any, dtype[number[Any]]]")  [operator]
