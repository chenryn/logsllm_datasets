I'm running into huge build time issues with webpack. We're using a
combination of TypeScript, CoffeeScript, and SCSS. I've tried poking around
with disabling source maps and other stuff but it seems like the core issue is
that the compilers for these languages are just slow. If I understand
correctly, all of these languages have the property where the individual files
can be compiled independently and the result will still be valid. Given this
1:1 mapping property it seems like webpack could build much faster with a
plugin that maintains a content-addressed map of original files to compiled
files on the file system and avoids rebuilding files that haven't changed
(using webpack's in-memory watch functionality doesn't work for our use case).
However I can't see any documentation about something like this, I can't find
a plugin that does this, and I don't see any obvious way of building a plugin
like that after poking around in the webpack source code for a bit. Is this
something that could be made to work with webpack? Even better, does it
already exist?
