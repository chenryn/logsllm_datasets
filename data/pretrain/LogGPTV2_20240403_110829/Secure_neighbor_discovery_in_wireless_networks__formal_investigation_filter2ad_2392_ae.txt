Moreover, we consider ND when both nodes running the
ND protocol are correct. Removing this assumption implies
that, for example, the P T protocol does not satisfy the ND
speciﬁcation: consider an adversarial node B that generates
a message time-stamped in the future, passes this message
to another adversarial node C, which in turn passes it to a
correct node A that falsely accepts (a perhaps very remote)
B as a neighbor. In Section 7 two protocols that solve this
problem under a speciﬁc assumption are discussed.
As mobility was not included in our model, the protocols
we analyze can be considered secure as long as the node
movement during the protocol execution is negligible. This
is not a strong requirement, if we compare the typical speed
at which nodes move (below the speed of sound in almost
all cases) with the RF propagation speed. However, no-
tably because some computational operations may be time-
consuming, we plan to include mobility in our model in the
future.
All the adversary models in this paper capture the tech-
nically feasible yet non-trivial ability to send and receive
messages at the same time. For a weaker security result,
one could assume that an adversarial node must receive the
whole message before it can relay it. For such an adversary,
a protocol whose every messages duration is longer than R
v
would solve ND (by Theorem 3).
Similarly to the vision of the authors of [13], P T and P GT
functionality could be integrated into every packet as a leash.
Alternatively, ND beacons can be broadcasted periodically,
with the neighbor relation interpolated in between received
beacons. The former solution provides better security at the
expense of transmission overhead, whereas the latter might
oﬀer the adversary a window of opportunity to launch an
attack if and only if the state of neighbor relation changes
between two beacon broadcasts.
Imperfect Clocks and Localization. Up to this point, we
assumed that correct nodes have accurate time and location
information. However, inaccuracies are possible in reality:
(i) time inaccuracies due to clock drifts, failure to synchro-
nize clocks, coarse-grained clocks, as well as the diﬃculty
to calculate message reception time, and (ii) location inac-
curacies due to unavailability of infrastructure (e.g., Global
Positioning System (GPS), or base stations) providing lo-
cation information, malicious disruptions of infrastructure,
and granularity and capabilities of self-localization sensors.
Non-line-of-sight propagation can be perceived as another
source of time inaccuracy. As the P T and P GT protocols rely
on distance estimates based on time and location measure-
ments, their eﬀectiveness can be aﬀected by inaccuracies.
We model the eﬀect of time inaccuracy by a parameter
δ, such that measured delay = real delay + d, with |d| (cid:54)
δ. Similarly, for location information, measured distance =
real distance + sv, with |s| (cid:54) τ . We express the inaccu-
racy term sv as a function of delay (time), so that it is
straightforward to consider the cumulative impact for the
P GT protocol.
First, for P T, two correct neighbors at a distance larger than
10
R − vδ may fail to conclude they are neighbors, thus vio-
lating ND2. This can be addressed if R(cid:48) = R + vδ is used
in place of the ND range R. But then, if ∆relay < R
v + δ,
or ∆relay < R(cid:48)
v , ND1 would be violated, that is, the adver-
sary would mount a successful attack. In other words, time
inaccuracies essentially decrease the ND security.
To cope with inaccuracies, the P GT protocol presented in
Section 5 needs to be modiﬁed slightly: The check for equal-
ity of the time- and location-based estimates of distance
should be replaced with approximate equality; otherwise ND2
will be violated. More precisely, these two estimates should
be within δ + τ of each other. But, again, ensuring practi-
cality decreases security: if ∆relay < 2(δ + τ ), the adversary
could violate ND1.
More generally, for T-protocols, no additional considera-
tion with respect to the impossibility results is necessary,
as R (cid:54) R(cid:48). But for TL-protocols, the inaccuracies in time
and location could be viewed as an impossibility factor: for
given δ, τ , there is no protocol solving the ND problem if
the adversary can relay with delay ∆relay < 2(δ + τ ). We
emphasize however that the nature of these impossibility re-
sults diﬀers, as it is not fundamental, as in the T-protocol
case, but can be mitigated by introducing more sophisti-
cated technology and obtaining accurate time and location,
as long as line-of-sight propagation is assumed.
Finally, we note that accurate time and location information
are not possible to achieve without specialized hardware. In
addition, tight synchronization is nontrivial, but challenge-
response protocols that do not need synchronized clocks can
overcome this problem.
7. RELATED WORK
The prevalent wormhole prevention mechanism is based on
distance bounding, which was ﬁrst proposed by Brands and
Chaum in [2] to thwart a relay attack between two cor-
rect nodes, also termed maﬁa fraud. Essentially, distance
bounding estimates the distance between two nodes, with
the guarantee that it is not smaller from their real distance.
Subsequent proposals contributed in aspects such as mutual
authentication [26], eﬃciency [10], and resistance to exe-
cution of the protocol with a colluding group of adversarial
nodes [3, 23]. In the latter, the attack termed terrorist fraud
is thwarted under the assumption that adversarial nodes do
not expose their private cryptographic material; if not, one
adversarial node can undetectably impersonate another and
successfully stage a terrorist fraud. Authenticated ranging,
proposed by ˇCapkun and Hubaux in [27], lifts the technically
non-trivial requirement of rapid response (present in all the
above protocols), at the expense of not being resilient to a
distance fraud, when the protocol is executed with a single,
non-colluding adversarial node [3]. This group of protocols,
in which temporal packet leashes [13] and TrueLink [8] (both
not resistent to the distance fraud) can be included, was the
main inspiration for our investigation that led to a general
impossibility result.
Another group of ND mechanisms is based on location, with
geographical packet leashes [13] the primary representative.
The impossibility result does not apply here, as T-protocols
are not location-aware. Indeed, we prove that P GT, an TL-
protocol, can solve ND. We emphasize that P GT is diﬀerent
from geographical packet leashes, because it requires clock
synchronization as tight as that for temporal packet leashes.
Essentially, P GT is a combination of temporal and geograph-
ical leashes. Upon careful inspection of the literature, there
exist prior passages seemingly cluing or relating to this idea:
the introduction of [12] or the discussion of combining a so-
called node-centric localization scheme with distance bound-
ing techniques [28]. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowl-
edge, we are the ﬁrst to explicitly point out the advantages,
over other approaches for secure ND, of combining location
information with tight temporal bounds. We note that the
authors of [13] mention the obstacle problem, but only in
the case of geographical packet leashes. However, the solu-
tion that they propose – having a radio propagation model
at every node – is not applicable in most scenarios.
The approach of Poovendran and Lazos [21] can be seen
as an extension of a location based scheme: a few trusted
nodes (guards) are aware of their location, transmit it pe-
riodically in beacons, and all other nodes determine their
neighbors based on whether they received suﬃciently many
common beacons. This scheme is a multi-party ND protocol
and thus our impossibility result does not apply. Unfortu-
nately, from the perspective of our approach, [21] has some
serious drawbacks. Most notably, it relies on the “no ob-
structions” assumption – nodes that are close but cannot
communicate can be tricked into establishing a neighbor re-
lation. In addition, adversarial nodes are rather limited in
their behavior: one can see an attack against this scheme,
in particular Claim 2, when adversarial nodes are allowed to
selectively relay beacon messages.
A scheme using directional antennas was proposed by Hu
and Evans in [12], with the interesting property that it can
be used as a two-party ND protocol, or as a multi-party ND
protocol with additional nodes serving as veriﬁers of neigh-
bor relations. In the two-party operation the scheme has se-
curity weaknesses that the multi-party version is called upon
to remedy. In the latter case, our impossibility result does
not apply directly. Nonetheless, signiﬁcant security prob-
lems remain, with the scheme oblivious to obstacles and the
adversary model limited. As the authors point out, a suc-
cessful attack can be mounted if more than two adversarial
nodes collaborate. Recall that in our proofs we allow for
arbitrary node collaboration (or collusion).
[14] proposes to collect local, k-hop connectivity information
obtained with a non-secure ND mechanism, and to inspect
it for forbidden structures: subgraphs that are likely to exist
only if a wormhole is present in the vicinity. The exchange
of connectivity information makes it a multi-party protocol.
Although the simulations presented in [14] show a very good
detection rate, as in [21], the considered adversary is quite
naive: a single non-selective long-range wormhole.
A diﬀerent approach to secure neighbor discovery could ex-
ploit radio frequency ﬁngerprinting (RFF) [4]: devices from
the same production line are not identical, but rather the
signals each one emits may have unique identiﬁable features.
If these signals can be identiﬁed upon reception of a mes-
sage, it becomes impossible for an adversarial node to relay
any message undetected.
If such a scheme were in place,
11
our impossibility result would not apply. The reason is that
impossibility hinges on the very fact that a correct node
cannot identify how a message was received. This essen-
tially allows the adversary to relay wireless transmissions
(messages). However, it is questionable if RFF can be used
to secure ND. Investigations with diﬀerent types of devices,
e.g.,
[25], show classiﬁcation success rate around
90% in laboratory conditions. At the same time, ﬁndings
such as “... radios were found to have ﬁngerprints that were
virtually indistinguishable from each other, making the iden-
tiﬁcation process more diﬃcult, if not impossible...” [7] clue
on unresolved limitations.
[22] or
The wormhole attack, in its symptoms, bears similarity to
two other fundamental and hard to detect attacks. On one
hand, a wormhole end can be perceived as a Sybil node, with
messages tied to diﬀerent identities being transmitted by a
single node. Hence, seemingly, a Sybil node detection mech-
anism [17] could be used to thwart relay attacks. However,
a wormhole can selectively relay the messages of a single
node, and still be eﬀective (e.g. Figure 2, setting S c). On
the other hand, as in the node replication attack, messages
tied to a single identity are transmitted by more than one
node. However, node replication is harder to detect than
a wormhole attack: schemes that address node replication
[20, 5] focus on probabilistically detecting replicas located
in remote parts of the network and require that nodes are
location-aware. Obviously, a long-range wormhole can be
easily (and deterministically) prevented using geographical
packet leashes.
A large body of work on formal reasoning on cryptographic
protocols exists, yet the classical cryptographic protocols
live in the Internet: thus these methods are agnostic about
the characteristics of the communication medium, especially
a wireless one. Recently, there has been a rising interest
in formalizing analysis of security protocols in wireless net-
works. The problem of distance bounding has been treated
formally in [15], whereas other works were concerned with
routing [16, 1, 18, 29] or local area networking [11]. These
works are concerned with diﬀerent problems and their ap-
proaches are not amenable to reason about secure neighbor
discovery.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We investigate the problem of secure neighbor discovery
(ND) in wireless networks. We build a formal framework,
and provide a speciﬁcation of neighbor discovery or, more
precisely, its most basic variant: two-party ND. We con-
sider two general classes of protocols: time-based protocols
(T-protocols) and time- and location-based protocols (TL-
protocols). For the T-protocol class, we identify a funda-
mental limitation governed by a threshold value depending
on the ND range: We prove that no T-protocol can solve
the ND problem if and only if adversarial nodes can relay
messages faster than this threshold. This result is a use-
ful measure of the ND security achieved by T-protocols and
leads us to investigate other classes of protocols.
In particular, we prove that no such limitation exists for
the class of TL-protocols: They can solve the ND problem
for any adversary, as long as the time and location measure-
ments are accurate enough, and line-of-sight signal propaga-
tion is assumed. The protocols we analyze are very simple if
not the simplest possible to allow positive results. In future
work, we will focus on a larger spectrum of protocols, most
notably multi-party neighbor discovery, as well as model ad-
ditional aspects, such as the ability of nodes of controlling
their transmission power.
