both defenders have behavioral bias with α1 = α2 = 0.5.
Figures 3a and 3b illustrate two distinct PNE for this game.
We obtained these multiple Nash equilibria by varying the
starting investment decision of defender D1 and then following

each defender are lower with the central regulator than with PNE.
Defenders D1 and D2 are behavioral decision-makers with α1 =
α2 = 0.5. In (a) and (b), the numbers above/left and below/right
of the edges represent investments by D1 and D2, respectively. In
(c) and (d) these numbers represent investments by rational and
behavioral (with α = 0.5) central regulator, respectively.
an equilibrium. It is interesting to note that these two Nash
equilibria lead to different costs for the defenders.
Difference between PNE and social optimal: First, for
the Nash equilibrium of Figure 3a, defender D1’s perceived
expected cost, given by (4), is equal to exp(−4), while her true
expected cost, given by (1), is equal to exp(−8). Defender D2
has a perceived expected cost of exp(−6), and a true expected
cost of exp(−12). In contrast, for the Nash equilibrium in
Figure 3b, defender D1 has a perceived expected cost of
exp(−4.5) and a true expected cost of exp(−10). Defender
D2 has a perceived expected cost of exp(−5.78) and a true
expected cost of exp(−11.28). As a result, the equilibrium in
Figure 3a is preferred by defender D2, while the equilibrium
in Figure 3b has a lower expected cost (both perceived and
real) for defender D1.
Second, we calculate the optimal investments by a social
planner for such network. We assume that this social planner
would have the same total budget (i.e., the sum of the two
budgets of defenders D1 and D2) and calculate the optimal
investment of that social planner (given by (5)). Figure 3c
shows that the rational social planner would distribute her
budget equally (only) on the edges (vs, v1) and (vs, v3) while
Figure 3d shows that
the behavioral social planner (with
α = 0.5) would distribute investments on all edges. We
emphasize that
the true expected cost of defender D1 is
exp(−14.0) and the true expected cost of defender D2 is
exp(−14.0) under rational central planning. On the other hand,
the true expected cost of D1 is exp(−11.88) and the true
expected cost of defender D2 is exp(−12.31) under behavioral
central planning. In other words, rational central planning is
better for both defenders and for the system as a whole.

Key takeaways: For both scenarios (rational social planner
the true costs are better
and behavioral social planner),
(lower) for both defenders than in both of the attained PNEs.
Moreover, the system’s social cost is lower under such socially
optimal solutions. This example sheds light on the inefficiency
of the PNEs compared to the social optimal solution. In this
context, the notion of Price of Anarchy (PoA) is often used to
quantify the inefficiency of Nash equilibrium compared to the
socially optimal outcome [50]. The Price of Anarchy is defined
as the ratio of the highest total system cost at a PNE to the
total system cost at the social optimum. In Example 1, the
PoA under rational and behavioral social planning is 205.41
and 30.11, respectively, indicating a 205X and 30X reduction
in expected security loss with central planning. The higher the
PoA is, the greater is the motivation for centralized design of
a mechanism that incentivizes the defenders to enhance their
investments and achieve social optimal.
Example 2. Consider the attack graph in Figure 4, where
the probability of successful attack on each edge (vi, vj) is
i,j = 1. This graph contains |D| = K
given by (2) with p0
defenders, and each defender Dk is responsible for defending
target node vk. Assume the total security budget B is divided
equally between the K defenders (i.e., each defender has a
K ). Let all nodes v1, v2,··· , vK have same
security budget of B
loss which is L. Then, the socially optimal solution would put
all the budget B on the first edge (vs, v1), so that all nodes
have probability of successful attack given by exp(−B).
We now characterize the cost under the PNE for behavioral
defenders. This PNE is given by the investment profile where
each defender Dk puts their entire budget B
K on the edge
coming into their node vk. To show this, first consider defender
D1. Since investments on edges other than (vs, v1) do not
affect the probability of successful attack at node v1, it is
optimal for defender D1 to put all her investment on (vs, v1).
Now, given D1’s investment on (vs, v1), defender D2 should
K over the two edges (vs, v1)
optimally spread her budget of B
and (v1, v2) in order to minimize her cost (4). Thus, D2’s
optimization problem, given D1’s investment, is

Thus, the PoA in this game instance grows exponentially in
the sum of budgets B.
In total, the two examples show the importance of attaining
social optimal solution for both per-defender total real loss
and the social cost (sum of defenders’ real total losses).
V. MECHANISM TYPES AND PROPERTIES
We now provide two incentive mechanisms
in our
interdependent security games, and identify features of the
interdependent systems that affect the properties attainable
through these mechanisms. Specifically, we explain and study
the performance of the two mechanisms (the Externality
mechanism and the VCG mechanism) within our class of
interdependent security games.
A. The Externality Mechanism
We now introduce the Externality mechanism inspired by
the work of Hurwicz [51]. A main design goal of this
mechanism is to guarantee a complete redistribution of taxes;
i.e., strong budget balance. This mechanism has been adapted
in [35], where it
is shown to achieve social optimality,
guarantee participation, and maintain a balanced budget, in
allocation of power in cellular networks. However, the recent
work [37] has shown that this is not the case in security games
where each defender has a single asset in which she allocates
her resources. However, that work only considered classical
decision-making models (where all defenders are assumed
to be fully rational decision-makers), and did not consider
interdependency (attack graph models).

Let us denote the total tax paid by defender Dk at the

As a result, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions on (8)
yield that the tax term of defender Dk under the Externality
mechanism in our interdependent security games is given by:

In other words,
tax paid by defender Dk is a
summation of the taxes over all edges, where the tax on each
edge depends on the sum of the externalities of all defenders
on that edge. Specifically, the investment by defender Dn on
the edge (vi, vj) is denoted by xn∗
i,j.
Thus, the tax term that Dk pays due to the externality of
defender Dn’s investment on the edge (vi, vj) is given by

Interpretation of
the Externality Mechanism: The
interpretation of the above tax terms is that by implementing
this externality mechanism, each defender Dk will be
financing part of defender Dn ̸= Dk’s reimbursement.
According to (9) and (10), this amount is proportional to the
positive externality of Dn’s investment on Dk’s cost.
Individual rationality and budget deficit: It can be shown
that despite attaining the socially optimal solution, these taxes
may fail to satisfy the weak budget balance constraint in our
behavioral interdependent security games. We characterize this
finding via the following result.
Proposition 2. There exists an interdependent security game
instance where the Externality mechanism cannot implement
the social optimal while guaranteeing weak budget balance.
Proof. See Appendix A.
Interpretation: Proposition 2 shows a budget deficit case
for the Externality mechanism in which the central regulator
has to spend out-of-pocket money to incentivize the defenders
to achieve the socially optimal solution in the context of our
interdependent security games (modeled by attack graphs).
Thus, we show for the first
the prior result of
Externality mechanism [35], [51], [52], social optimality and
balanced budget, is not guaranteed in interdependent systems.
Now, we turn our attention to the effect of defender’s
time that
behavioral bias on amount of taxes paid by the defender.
Theorem 1. Consider a set of defenders D and an underlying
attack graph G. Suppose that the joint investment profile by
all defenders except Dk, denoted by x−k, is fixed. Suppose
that pi,j(xi,j) ∈ (0, 1
e ]. Then the tax paid by defender Dk
under Externality mechanism, denoted by t∗
k(x∗) in (9), is
a decreasing function in αk. In other words, the behavioral
defender pays more taxes compared to a rational defender.
Proof. See Appendix B.
the perception of
Behavioral level and the amount of taxes: Theorem 1
shows that under appropriate conditions,
the behavioral
defender would pay more taxes compared to a rational
defender under the Externality mechanism. The reason for
such an increase in taxes is that
the
behavioral defender of the externality from other defenders’
investments (via the drop in her perceived cost from such
investments) induce the defender to pay more taxes for such
a (perceived) increased safety level. We emphasize that the
central regulator does not enforce rational decision-making
