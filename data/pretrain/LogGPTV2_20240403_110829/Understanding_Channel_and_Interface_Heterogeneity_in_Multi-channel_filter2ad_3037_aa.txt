## Abstract

Multi-channel multi-radio architectures have been extensively studied for 802.11-based wireless mesh networks to address the capacity problem caused by wireless interference. These studies typically assume that all channels and radio interfaces are homogeneous. However, in practice, different channels exhibit varying link qualities depending on the propagation environment. Additionally, different interfaces on the same node can show link quality variations due to hardware differences and required antenna separations. This paper presents a detailed measurement study of these variations using two mesh network testbeds operating in different frequency bands: 802.11g in the 2.4 GHz band and 802.11a in the 5 GHz band. Our results demonstrate that these variations are significant and non-trivial, meaning that the same channel does not perform consistently across all links, and the same interface does not perform uniformly with all other interfaces. We also show that incorporating channel-specific link quality information into a candidate channel assignment algorithm can improve its performance by more than three times on average.

## 1. Introduction

Wireless mesh networks based on commodity 802.11 radios offer a cost-effective solution for providing broadband network coverage. However, these networks suffer from severe interference problems, which limit their capacity due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. A common method to enhance capacity is to use multiple orthogonal channels available in the 802.11 standard. The core idea is to reduce interference by assigning different channels to neighboring links. Nodes can use multiple channels in two ways: either by dynamically switching channels on a single radio interface or by adopting a multi-radio solution where each node has multiple radio interfaces tuned to different channels, either statically or dynamically at a longer time scale.

The first method—dynamic channel switching on a single radio interface—has proven impractical due to high switching latency in commodity 802.11 radios. Therefore, the research community has predominantly focused on the multi-radio solution. The challenge here is to develop channel assignment techniques that optimize an appropriate criterion, such as reducing network interference or improving capacity. Many papers have been published on this topic, offering centralized or distributed solutions, investigating optimality, and comparing performances. However, a common limitation in these works is the assumption that all channels and radio interfaces are homogeneous.

In reality, 802.11 channels vary significantly in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Different radio interfaces on the same mesh nodes often provide different SNR measures even for the same channel. This work aims to understand and demonstrate the heterogeneity in channels and interfaces through a set of careful measurements on two different wireless mesh network testbeds (802.11g and 802.11a) covering a wide spectrum of possibilities. We show experimentally that the homogeneity assumptions often lead to poor channel assignments. We then follow up with techniques to incorporate channel-specific link quality information into channel assignment algorithms to improve their performance.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the details of our mesh testbeds. Section 3 presents measurement results to understand channel heterogeneity. Section 4 presents measurement results to understand interface heterogeneity in multi-radio mesh networks. Section 5 demonstrates how to improve the performance of channel assignment algorithms with channel heterogeneity information. Related work is presented in Section 6, and we conclude the paper by describing future directions in Section 7.

## 2. Testbeds

The measurements reported in this paper are from two different wireless mesh network testbeds (802.11g and 802.11a) set up in our departmental building. The 802.11g testbed uses 10 Dell Latitude D510 laptops, each equipped with one Atheros chipset-based D-Link DWL AG660 PCMCIA 802.11a/b/g card with an internal antenna. The transmit power is fixed at 15 dBm, and the data rate is set to 11 Mbps. Measurements from this testbed were collected on 40 different links using three orthogonal channels (1, 6, 11) in the 802.11g band.

The 802.11a testbed consists of 13 nodes, each a Soekris net4801 single board computer (SBC). The PCI slot in the SBC is expanded into 4 miniPCI slots using a PCI-to-miniPCI adapter. Four 802.11a/b/g miniPCI wireless cards based on the Atheros chipset with external antennas are used in each mesh node. To overcome radio leakage problems, the external antennas were physically separated by about 0.5 meters. Otherwise, there was noticeable interference even among orthogonal channels across interfaces on the same node. The transmit power is fixed at 15 dBm, and the data rate is set to 6 Mbps. Measurements from this testbed were collected on 78 different links using 13 orthogonal channels (between 5180-5825 MHz) in the 802.11a band. Note that the 802.11a testbed is relatively free from external interference, as there are no other networks operating in this band in the building. However, several 802.11g networks are present, and their influence is impossible to eliminate. Experiments were conducted during late night and early morning when other active 802.11g clients are unlikely to be active.

All nodes in both testbeds run Linux (kernel 2.6.22 in laptops and kernel 2.4.29 in the Soekris boxes) and the widely used madwifi device driver (version v0.9.4) for the 802.11 interfaces. Standard Linux tools such as iperf were used to send UDP packets on the sender node for each link measured, and tcpdump on the receiver node running on a raw monitoring interface to capture the packets. This provides additional prism monitoring header information, including received signal strength (RSS), noise, channel, and data rate for every received packet.

## 3. Channel Diversity

This section presents the results of our measurement study to understand the heterogeneity in channels due to varying path loss of different frequency bands. We first show that the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of packets in each link is relatively stable in each channel and is a good metric to compare the performance of any given link when using different channels.

### 3.1 Long-Term Variation of RSS

We studied a single link in the 802.11a testbed for a 24-hour period by sending 1000-byte UDP packets at a rate of 100 packets per second. This experiment was repeated on 7 different 802.11a channels for the same link. Figure 1(a) shows the Allan deviation in the RSS values in each of the 7 channels at different time intervals ranging from 100 ms to 10 hours. Allan deviation is a metric used to quantify the burstiness of variation in any quantity. The median variation is about 1.5 dBm, and the 90% variation is about 2.5 dBm in a single channel. The variations are similar across all 7 channels. The small variations at different intervals, considering the minimum granularity of RSS measurements is 1 dBm, indicate that the variation in RSS value is minimal. Sampling RSS values at smaller intervals (in the order of tens of seconds) can be representative of longer measurements. Similar results were observed in the 802.11g testbed, but are not reported here due to space constraints.

### 3.2 Relation between RSS and Delivery Ratio

Having established that RSS is relatively stable over long periods, we next show that RSS is a good predictor of link performance in each channel. For this, we studied 78 different links in the 802.11a testbed by sending back-to-back 1000-byte packets in each link using the 13 orthogonal channels for a period of 60 seconds, one after another. We measured the average RSS value and delivery ratio for each link in different channels. Figure 1(b) shows the relationship between average RSS and the delivery ratio of the links in our 802.11a testbed. The scatter plot of average RSS vs. delivery ratio of each link for all channels, along with the interpolations (the dark lines) of the aggregated data, is shown. Visually, it appears that the RSS vs. delivery ratio statistics is independent of channels, with no definite channel-specific pattern emerging. The R2 values for each individual channel data with respect to the interpolation (noted in the plots) are similar across channels, varying between 0.82–0.94. This indicates that RSS is a good predictor of delivery ratio, and this relationship is relatively independent of the channel used. Delivery ratio (or throughput) is a commonly accepted performance metric for upper-layer protocols. Similar characteristics were observed in the 800.11g testbed. Thus, we can focus on RSS alone to understand channel and interface-specific behavior, as this fundamental metric is influenced by the propagation environment.

### 3.3 Link Behavior in Different Channels

We now examine the average RSS value (with 95% confidence interval) on each channel for two sample links in each testbed. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the performance of two 802.11g links. In both cases, there is considerable variation in RSS across different channels. In the first case, despite the variation in RSS, the delivery ratios do not vary much because the RSS values are already quite high. In the second case, the delivery ratio of the link is good in channels 1 and 6 but poor in channel 11. A similar behavior is observed in the 802.11a testbed. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show two sample links, demonstrating that RSS on a link can be channel-specific and can significantly impact the delivery ratio.

Figure 3(a) shows the range of variation in RSS value for each link in the 802.11g testbed. The bars represent the maximum and minimum RSS values for each link across all channels. The median RSS range (i.e., the median of the difference between the maximum and minimum RSS values) is 10 dBm, indicating significant variability.

## 4. Interface Heterogeneity

This section presents measurement results to understand the heterogeneity in radio interfaces within multi-radio mesh networks. Different interfaces on the same node can exhibit varying link qualities due to hardware differences and required antenna separations. We conducted experiments to measure the link quality of different interfaces on the same node and found significant variations. These variations can be attributed to factors such as manufacturing tolerances, antenna placement, and environmental conditions.

### 4.1 Interface-Specific Link Quality

To understand the interface-specific link quality, we measured the RSS and delivery ratio for each interface on the same node. Figure 4(a) shows the RSS values for four interfaces on a single node in the 802.11a testbed. The RSS values vary significantly, with some interfaces showing higher RSS values than others. Similarly, the delivery ratios for different interfaces also vary, as shown in Figure 4(b). These results highlight the importance of considering interface-specific link quality in channel assignment algorithms.

### 4.2 Impact on Network Performance

The heterogeneity in radio interfaces can have a significant impact on the overall network performance. If a channel assignment algorithm assumes all interfaces to be homogeneous, it may result in suboptimal channel assignments. By incorporating interface-specific link quality information, the algorithm can make more informed decisions, leading to improved network performance. We demonstrate this in the next section by incorporating channel-specific link quality information into a channel assignment algorithm.

## 5. Improving Channel Assignment Algorithms

In this section, we demonstrate how to improve the performance of channel assignment algorithms by incorporating channel-specific link quality information. We use the candidate channel assignment algorithm and modify it to consider the RSS values and delivery ratios for each link and interface. The modified algorithm assigns channels to interfaces based on the best RSS and delivery ratio, rather than assuming all channels and interfaces to be homogeneous.

### 5.1 Algorithm Description

The modified channel assignment algorithm works as follows:
1. **Initialization**: Collect RSS and delivery ratio data for each link and interface.
2. **Channel Assignment**: For each link, assign the channel with the highest RSS and delivery ratio to the corresponding interface.
3. **Optimization**: Use a greedy approach to iteratively reassign channels to minimize interference and maximize overall network performance.

### 5.2 Performance Evaluation

We evaluated the performance of the modified channel assignment algorithm using the 802.11g and 802.11a testbeds. The results, shown in Figure 5, demonstrate that the modified algorithm improves the network performance by more than three times on average compared to the original algorithm. This improvement is due to the better utilization of channel-specific link quality information, leading to more efficient channel assignments and reduced interference.

## 6. Related Work

Several studies have addressed the channel assignment problem in multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks. Most of these studies assume that all channels and radio interfaces are homogeneous, which is not the case in practice. Some recent works have started to consider the heterogeneity in channels and interfaces, but they often lack a comprehensive measurement study to validate their assumptions. Our work fills this gap by providing a detailed measurement study and demonstrating the significant impact of channel and interface heterogeneity on network performance.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Directions

This paper presents a detailed measurement study of channel and interface heterogeneity in multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks. We show that the variations in RSS and delivery ratio across different channels and interfaces are significant and non-trivial. By incorporating channel-specific link quality information into channel assignment algorithms, we can significantly improve network performance. Future work will focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms that can adapt to dynamic changes in the network environment and further optimize channel assignments.
