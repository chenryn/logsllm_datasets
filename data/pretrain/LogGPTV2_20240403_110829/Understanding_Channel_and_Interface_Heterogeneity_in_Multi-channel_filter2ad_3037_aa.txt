Abstract. Multi-channel multi-radio architectures have been widely
studied for 802.11-based wireless mesh networks to address the capacity
problem due to wireless interference. They all utilize channel assignment
algorithms that assume all channels and radio interfaces to be homo-
geneous. However, in practice, diﬀerent channels exhibit diﬀerent link
qualities depending on the propagation environment for the same link.
Diﬀerent interfaces on the same node also exhibit link quality varia-
tions due to hardware diﬀerences and required antenna separations. We
present a detailed measurement study of these variations using two mesh
network testbeds in two diﬀerent frequency bands – 802.11g in 2.4GHz
band and 802.11a in 5GHz band. We show that the variations are sig-
niﬁcant and ‘non-trivial’ in the sense that the same channel does not
perform well for all links in a network, or the same interface does not
perform well for all interfaces it is paired up with for each link. We also
show that using the channel-speciﬁc link quality information in a candi-
date channel assignment algorithm improves its performance more than
3 times on average.
1 Introduction
Wireless mesh networks based on commodity 802.11 radios are good vehicles
to provide broadband network coverage at a low cost. Mesh networks, however,
suﬀer from serious interference problems limiting their capacity due to broadcast
nature of the wireless medium. A common method to improve capacity is to use
multiple orthogonal channels that are already available in the 802.11 standard.
The core idea is to limit the interference by using diﬀerent channels for neigh-
boring links. A network node can use multiple channels in two ways – either it
dynamically switches channel on the radio interface for diﬀerent transmissions,
or it adopts a multi-radio solution, where each node has multiple radio inter-
faces tuned to diﬀerent channels statically (or even dynamically, but at a longer
time scale). Diﬀerent links use diﬀerent interfaces and thus diﬀerent channels.
The ﬁrst method – dynamic channel switching on a single radio interface [2] –
has proved practically hard as switching latency could be high in commodity

802.11 radios [3]. Thus, the research community has pre-dominantly focused on
the multi-radio solution.
The challenge in this case is to develop techniques for channel assignment,
i.e., assigning channels to interfaces, subject to an appropriate optimization cri-
terion, for example, reducing network interference or improving capacity. Since
the number of interfaces in a network node is limited, this oﬀers a constraint to
the optimization problem. Many papers [7,9] (and references therein) have been
published on this channel assignment problem, oﬀering centralized or distributed
solutions, investigating optimality questions, comparing performances, etc. One
singular limitation of all these works is that they all assume that the channels and
radio interfaces are all homogeneous. However in practice, the 802.11 channels
vary signiﬁcantly in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Also, diﬀerent radio interfaces
on the same mesh nodes often provide diﬀerent SNR measures even for the same
channel. The goal of this work is to understand and demonstrate the heterogene-
ity in channels and interfaces via a set of careful measurements on two diﬀerent
wireless mesh network testbeds (802.11g and 802.11a) covering a wide-spectrum
of possibilities. We show experimentally that the homogeneity assumptions of-
ten lead to very poor channel assignment. We followup the measurements with
techniques to incorporate channel-speciﬁc link quality information in channel
assignment algorithms to improve their performance.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the
details of our mesh testbeds. We present measurement results to understand
channel heterogeneity in Section 3. Section 4 presents measurement results to
understand interface heterogeneity in multi-radio mesh networks. We demon-
strate how to improve the performance of channel assignment algorithms with
channel heterogeneity information in Section 5. Related work is presented in
Section 6 and we conclude the paper describing future directions in Section 7.
2 Testbeds
The measurements reported in this paper are from two diﬀerent wireless mesh
network testbeds (802.11g and 802.11a) set up in our departmental building as
described below. The 802.11g testbed uses 10 Dell latitude D510 laptops each
with one Atheros chipset based D-link DWL AG660 PCMCIA 802.11a/b/g card
with an internal antenna. The transmit powers are ﬁxed to 15 dBm and data rate
to 11 Mbps. Measurements from this testbed were collected on 40 diﬀerent links
on three orthogonal channels 1, 6, 11 (2412, 2437 and 2462 MHz respectively)
in the 802.11g band. The 802.11a testbed consists of 13 nodes each of which is a
Soekris net4801 [1] single board computer (SBC). The PCI-slot in the SBC is ex-
panded into 4 miniPCI slots using a PCI-to-miniPCI adapter. Four 802.11a/b/g
miniPCI wireless cards based on Atheros chipset with external antennas are
used in each mesh node. In order to overcome radio leakage problems, we phys-
ically separated the external antennas at a distance of about 0.5 meters based
on measurements similar to [8]. Otherwise, there was a perceptible interference

even among orthogonal channels across interfaces on the same node.1 The trans-
mit powers are ﬁxed to 15 dBm and data rate to 6 Mbps. Measurements from this
testbed were collected on 78 diﬀerent links in 13 orthogonal channels (between
5180-5825 Mhz) in the 802.11a band. Note that the 802.11a testbed is relatively
free from external interference as there are no other networks operating in this
band in the building. However, there are indeed several 802.11g networks in our
building. Their inﬂuence is impossible to eliminate. We, however, did our exper-
iments in this network during late night and early morning when other active
802.11g clients are unlikely.
All nodes in both the testbeds run Linux (kernel 2.6.22 in laptops and kernel
2.4.29 in the Soekris boxes) and the widely used madwifi device driver (version
v0.9.4) for the 802.11 interfaces. We used standard linux tools such as iperf to
send UDP packets on the sender node for each link measured and tcpdump on the
receiver node running on a raw monitoring interface to capture the packets. This
gives us the additional prism monitoring header information such as the received
signal strength (RSS), noise, channel and data rate for every received packet.
3 Channel Diversity
This section shows the results of our measurement study to understand the
heterogeneity in channels due to varying path loss of diﬀerent frequency bands.
In the following, we ﬁrst show that Received Signal Strength (RSS) of packets
in each link is relatively stable in each channel and is a ‘good’ metric to compare
the performance of any given link when using diﬀerent channels.
3.1 Long Term Variation of RSS
We study a single link in the 802.11a testbed for a 24 hour period by sending 1000-
byte UDP packets at a rate of 100 packets per second. We repeat this experiment
on 7 diﬀerent 802.11a channels for the same link. Figure 1(a) shows the Allan de-
viation in the RSS values in each of the 7 channels at diﬀerent time intervals rang-
ing from 100 ms to 10 hours. Allan deviation is used as a metric to quantify the
burstiness of variation in any quantity. The median variation is about 1.5 dBm
and the 90% variation is about 2.5 dBm in a single channel. The variations are
similar across all 7 channels. We see that the variation at diﬀerent intervals are
small considering the minimum granularity of RSS measurements is 1 dBm. This
ﬁgure shows that in any given channel, the variation in RSS value is minimal and
sampling RSS values at smaller intervals (in the order of tens of seconds) can be
representative of longer measurements. We also see similar results in the 802.11g
testbed which are not reported here due to space constraints.
1 Even with this setup, we could use only a subset of orthogonal channels without
interference. These are 7 channels (channels 36, 44, 52, 60, 149, 157, 165) out of pos-
sible 13 orthogonal channels. Thus, we used these 7 channels for channel assignment
in Section 5. However, we used all 13 channels to study the channel characteristics
in Sections 3 and 4.

3.2 Relation between RSS and Delivery Ratio
Now that we have seen that RSS is relatively stable over long periods of time,
next our goal is to show that RSS is a good predictor of link performance in each
channel. For this, we studied 78 diﬀerent links in the 802.11a testbed by sending
back-to-back 1000-byte packets in each link using the 13 orthogonal channels
for a period of 60 seconds one after another and measured the average RSS
value and delivery ratio for each link in diﬀerent channels. Figure 1(b) shows
the relationship between average RSS and the delivery ratio of the links in our
802.11a testbeds. It shows a scatter plot of average RSS vs. delivery ratio of each
link for all channels. The interpolations (the dark lines) of the aggregated data
are also shown. Visually it appears that the RSS vs. delivery ratio statistics is
independent of channels – no deﬁnite channel speciﬁc pattern emerges. We have
also computed the R2 value for each individual channel data with respect to the
interpolation (noted in the plots). The R2 values are similar across channels -
varying between 0.82–0.94. This shows that RSS is a good predictor of delivery
ratio and this relationship is relatively independent of the channel used. Note
that delivery ratio (or, throughput) is a commonly accepted performance metric
for the upper layer protocols. We observed similar characteristics from measure-
ments in the 802.11g testbed. Thus, we can focus on RSS alone to understand
channel and interface speciﬁc behavior as this fundamental metric is inﬂuenced
by the propagation environment.

3.3 Link Behavior in Diﬀerent Channels
Now we look at the average RSS value (with 95% conﬁdence interval) on each
channel for two sample links in each testbed. See Figure 2. Figures 2(a) and 2(b)
show the performance of two 802.11g links. In both cases, we see considerable
variation in RSS in diﬀerent channels. In the ﬁrst case, even though there is
variation in RSS, the delivery ratios do not vary much. This is because the
RSS values are already quite high. In the second case, we see that the delivery
ratio of the link is good in channel 1 and 6 but is quite poor in channel 11. A

Fig. 2. Variation of RSS and delivery ratio using diﬀerent channels on sample links in
our two testbeds
similar behavior is observed in the 802.11a testbed. See Figures 2(c) and 2(d)
for two sample links. These results demonstrate that RSS on a link could be
channel-speciﬁc and this can impact the delivery ratio signiﬁcantly.
It is now interesting to study how much variation is there in RSS values for
each of the 40 links in the 802.11g testbed and 78 links in the 802.11a testbed.
In Figure 3(a) we show the range of variation in RSS value for each link in the
802.11g testbed. The bars show the maximum and minimum RSS value for each
link considering all channels. The median RSS range (i.e., the median of the
