User: How to use Python to implement multithreaded programming, and explain the advantages and limitations of multithreaded programming.
Assistant: Python can use the threading module to implement multi-threaded programming. ``` import threading def hello(): print("Hello, world") t = threading.Thread(target=hello) t.start() ``` The advantage of multi-threaded programming is that multiple threads in a process can It executes multiple tasks at the same time, improves the CPU usage efficiency, and enables the program to respond to the user's operation more quickly. In addition, multi-threaded programming can take advantage of multi-core CPUs to further improve program performance. There are two main limitations of multi-threaded programming: one is that the data sharing and communication between threads are more complicated, which may easily lead to thread safety issues; And other issues. In order to avoid these problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the problems of data synchronization and mutual exclusion access when writing multi-threaded programs, and use appropriate tools and techniques to detect and solve problems such as deadlock and livelock.
