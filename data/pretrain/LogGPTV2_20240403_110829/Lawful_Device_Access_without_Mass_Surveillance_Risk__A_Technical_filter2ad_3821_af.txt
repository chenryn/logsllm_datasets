### Appendix A: Common Questions

Due to the long history of conflict over lawful access, there are several standard questions that frequently arise. While these questions have been addressed implicitly in the paper, we believe it is valuable to address them explicitly to avoid potential misunderstandings.

#### 1. **What prevents a criminal from simply using a third-party encryption product above the operating system or purchasing a phone abroad in a jurisdiction that doesn’t support lawful access?**

   - **Answer:** Nothing prevents such behavior. We do not believe there is an implementable policy option that would provide a universal decryption capability. Even the widely criticized Feinstein/Burr “Court Orders Act,” which mandates plain-text access capability for all software, services, and products sold, would not achieve this goal if implemented. Most criminals will not use such third-party products, or if they do, will not use them securely with device-independent credentials. This is similar to how most criminals do not encrypt their telephone calls or instant messages. It is not a new phenomenon that criminals with stronger operational security practices will require greater effort to investigate.

#### 2. **What about in an emergency? Surely a device could be unlocked if a victim’s life depended on it?**

   - **Answer:** The nature of the system we’ve described involves trade-offs that are inherently compromises. The purpose of the lockout period is to undermine the use of this mechanism for covert purposes. An inherent side effect of this design choice is that there is no mechanism for "expedient access." The choice of the lockout period duration implicitly balances the likelihood and costs of one scenario against the likelihood and costs of the other.

#### 3. **What if the manufacturer gets hacked by a state actor?**

   - **Answer:** It has become fashionable to observe that, with the plethora of high-profile state-sponsored data breaches (e.g., OPM), virtually all organizations are susceptible. If we are confident that state actors will so thoroughly penetrate a manufacturer as to compromise an offline HSM containing authorization keys and then exfiltrate those keys, how much trust can we place in the security of the significantly more valuable assets that the manufacturer must already protect? For example, capturing the signing keys for device updates would allow the creation of new code updates for any of the manufacturer's devices, providing arbitrary remote access at arbitrary scale. Similarly, any developer account with commit rights to system-level code is in a position to insert obfuscated vulnerabilities to be released in later software versions, providing large-scale remote covert capabilities. Leading device manufacturers (e.g., Apple, Google) frequently have access to much of their customer’s content online (e.g., via standard backup services and cloud services such as photos on Apple iCloud and email on Google’s Gmail). These are available to key employees and systems and are easier and/or more attractive targets for state actors. This is not to imply that manufacturers are not vulnerable to such attacks, but that we should not hold a significantly weaker lawful access capability to a higher standard of state actor-resistance than more valuable existing capabilities.

#### 4. **Don’t all lawful access schemes inherently weaken the security of the device?**

   - **Answer:** Part of the answer to this question is philosophical. Security is, among other things, about limiting data access to authorized parties. If we do not believe that law enforcement agents operating under color of law are authorized, then, by definition, any lawful access scheme weakens security. However, this is a definition that presupposes an answer and is an inherently non-technical argument. If instead, we accept the assumptions of this paper (i.e., that there is a communal interest in considering some such access authorized), then the answer to this question is more nuanced. The question now becomes, what is the residual risk that the mechanism provided for lawful access will be misused in unlawful ways? We do not believe the answer to this question is clear, and we have yet to identify how the approach described in this paper offers significantly greater residual risks than those we already face today.

#### 5. **Isn’t this scheme vulnerable to a variant of Tromer’s attack on CLEAR?**

   - **Answer:** As described, a qualified yes. Eran Tromer’s attack on Ozzie’s CLEAR proposal is a trojan man-in-the-middle attack in which an adversary attacks a phone \( x \) by creating an imitation phone \( x' \) that purports to be \( x \) (e.g., by announcing the DID the attacker obtains from \( x \)) and then plants the imitation phone (e.g., at a crime scene) to entice law enforcement to unlock the phone using their lawful access protocol. The imitation phone then relays all authorization protocol messages it receives from law enforcement to the attacker, who is then able to replay them to the targeted phone to unlock it. This attack exploits the implicit trust placed in the authorization protocol messages produced by a device under interrogation by law enforcement, and we have made no efforts to address it (i.e., in our current design, there is no attempt to authenticate that a device is who it says it is).

     However, the attack places unusually demanding requirements on the adversary: they must obtain extended physical access to the target device (i.e., to obtain its DID value), then create a replica device with internal hardware that will spoof the authorization protocol, then convince law enforcement to seize that device and obtain legal process for opening it. Most critically, they must devise a mechanism such that their replica device can transmit the messages it receives while in law enforcement custody (seized devices are routinely stored and accessed in RF-shielded environments precisely because law enforcement is concerned about outside tampering with a device). This is not to say that such a scenario is impossible. However, in our estimation, it is at the far end of the threat spectrum, and we feel that the value in addressing this particular threat is far outweighed by the value of simplicity in the current design. That said, we are confident that should others disagree with this assessment, there are a range of technical solutions that could be employed (e.g., time-bounding to prevent real-time relaying and explicit device authentication via a shared secret before providing any authorization material) to address this concern.
