examine the detection accuracy by setting different data col-
lection time periods. Due to the space limit, we only show
the results for OA-H in Figure 6. The conclusion is the same
for other settings. We ﬁnd that both AoA-Dev and CN0-Corr
can converge to a steady detection accuracy within 20 sec-
onds. In particular, the CN0-Corr method can achieve a 100%
accuracy within only 5 seconds. The reason is CN0-Corr
directly computes the correlation of CN0 sequences, which
only requires data from a partial rotation cycle.
Impact of Relative Movements. We run an additional
experiment to examine the potential impact of relative move-
ments between the spoofer and the victim. We take the UC-M
setting, and dynamically change the distance between the
spoofer and the victim phone during the experiment. We do
so by ﬁxing the victim location while moving the spoofer
around the victim within 1–15 meters. We run 40 spooﬁng
experiments and 40 non-spooﬁng experiments (30 seconds
per experiment), and the detection results are shown in Fig-
ure 7. The results conﬁrm that our methods remain effective.
Intuitively, even when the spoofer is moving, the CN0 mea-
surements from different spoofed signals are still synchro-
nized with each other in both time and degree domains, which
makes them detectable.

signals, the amplitude and phase are altered through time based on the attacker’s knowledge
of the receiver’s initial facing angle, rotational speed, and also satellite angle of arrival (AoE).

the spooﬁng signal patterns. To mimic the legitimate signals,
the spoofer can make Ai, γi, and Di functions of satellite
elevation, azimuth angle, and distance to the GPS receiver.
We implement this adaptive GPS spooﬁng attack by mod-
ifying the software prototype from Section 4.
Instead of
generating signals with constant power, the adaptive spoofer
changes the signal power in real time according to pre-
speciﬁed initial facing angle, rotational speed, and the satel-
lites’ positions. It renews power every 0.02 seconds (higher
than the GPS receiver’s 10Hz sampling rate). The goal is to
make sure the received signals by the GPS receiver remain
smooth without abrupt transitions.
8 Detection Methods for Adaptive Attack
To detect the adaptive attack, in this section, we develop
advanced detection methods based on the observation that
the rotation speed of a GPS receiver is inherently a secret
that can be dynamically changed by the defender. Incorrect
guesses of the rotation speed or the receiver’s real-time facing
angle could lead to inauthentic signal patterns. Based on this
intuition, we designed two methods to derive signals’ AoAs
from CN0 measurements to detect the adaptive attack.
8.1 Method 1: Average over Rotation Cycles
The ﬁrst method is to simply take the CNO measurements at
different rotation angles and average them over a large num-
ber of rotation rounds. As shown in Figure 10b, the spooﬁng
signals from the adaptive spoofer will be eventually “syn-
chronized”, leading to similar ﬁtting curves. This might be
counter-intuitive considering the adaptive attacker is already
simulating different spooﬁng signals for different satellites
(e.g., with different amplitude and phase modulations). Be-
low, we ﬁrst explain the insights from the high-level and then
demonstrate the reasoning mathematically.
High-level Intuitions.
Recall that we assume the attacker
needs to guess the rotation speed of the GPS receiver to mod-
ulate the GPS signal for each satellite. An incorrect guess

speed and initial phase.
(b) Incorrect guess of rotation
speed and initial phase.

means the modulated signal will not fully synchronize with
the rotation process. The received GPS signal is essentially
the product of the rotation effect and the attacker’s modulation.
For a given angle, we can measure the GPS signal strength
(CN0) during each rotation round. Because the modulation is
not fully synchronized with the rotation, at each round, the
receiver will end up sampling at (slightly) different phases
of the modulated signal. As a result, after sampling over a
large number of rotation rounds, the modulation effect will
be canceled out. In this case, the ﬁnal ﬁtting curve will be
dominated by the frequency of the rotation, which is the same
curve for all the satellites. By examining the ﬁnal curves, we
can reveal the true AoA of the spooﬁng signals.
Figure 10 shows an example. Figure 10b shows that if
the attacker incorrectly guesses the rotation speed, the ﬁnal
ﬁttings of different satellites will be “synchronized” due to
the phase cancellation over a large number of rounds. Even
though the CN0 measurements are not in a perfect Sine shape,
using Sine curves to ﬁt these dots will get synchronized re-
sults. Figure 10a shows an unrealistic case where the attacker
knows the exact rotating speed and the initial facing phase.
The attacker modulates the GPS signals that perfectly synchro-
nizes with the rotation. In this case, the CN0 measurement at
each angle will always be sampled from a particular modu-
lated phase. Without the cancellation effect, the ﬁnal ﬁtting

signals).
Mathematical Proof. We denote the GPS receiver’s gain
for a GPS signal si as Gi(θi,ϕi), where ϕi is the angle be-
tween orientation of the receiver and the satellite; θi is the
satellite si’s elevation angle in the sky as illustrated in Fig-
ure 9. Note that Gi(θi,ϕi) is a periodic function, which can
be mathematically expressed as
Gi(θi,ϕi) = Gi(θi,ϕi + 2πk) for any integer k ≥ 0.
Consider that we rotate the GPS receiver horizontally so
that only azimuth angle changes with time during the rotation
process. If the GPS receiver receives legitimate GPS signals,
the signal strength of a GPS signal i denoted as Ai, can be
expressed as:
(2)
Ai(∆) = Gi(θi,ϕi + ∆)Li,
(3)
where ∆ is the change in rotation angle and is a function of
time t. Li is the GPS signal’s strength at the receiver’s position,
and we assume Li is stable during the rotation process. After
n rounds of rotation, divide Ai measurements into n sections
of length 2π based on the corresponding rotation angle. The
average of Ai over a rotation angle ∆ across all these sections,
denoted as ¯Ai, has the following property:
n
∑n
k=0 Ai(∆ + 2πk)
¯Ai(∆) =
= Gi(θi,ϕi + ∆)Li,∀∆ ∈ [0,2π),
(4)
It can be observed that for legitimate GPS signals, since a
GPS satellite i’s signal comes from a different angle compared
with GPS satellite j’s signal, ϕi are different from ϕ j, which
results in a different Gi variation pattern.
Now consider the case when the GPS receiver is rotating
horizontally under adaptive attack by a single spoofer at a
position θ. The ith spooﬁng signal’s received signal strength,
denoted as A(cid:48)
i, can be expressed as:
A(cid:48)
i(∆) = Gi(θ,ϕ + ∆)Si(t∆),
(5)
After n rounds of rotation, divide A(cid:48)
where Si(t) is the spooﬁng signal at time t and t∆ is the time
when the receiver rotates ∆ angle. Note that since it is a single
spoofer case, θ and ϕ are the same across all spoofed signals.

n sections of length 2π by the corresponding rotation angle.
According to (1) and (5), the average of A(cid:48)
i for a particular ∆
across all these sections, denoted as ¯A(cid:48)
i(∆), can be expressed
by:
¯A(cid:48)

Consider the GPS receiver’s rotation speed as υ, then t∆+2πk =
∆/υ + 2πk/υ. As long as ωi/υ does not equal an integer,
n→∞≈ 0. Thus, (7) can be approximated to:
∑n
k=0 cos(ωit∆+2πk+γi)
n
¯A(cid:48)
i(∆)
n→∞≈ Gi(θ,ϕ + ∆)DiLi
(8)
Comparison of the mathematical expressions (4) and (8)
reveals two facts. First, as long as the adversary cannot per-
fectly synchronize its modulation frequency ω with the true
rotation speed of the GPS receiver, the mean received signal
strength at a particular rotation angle (i.e., ¯A(cid:48)
i) over a large
enough number of rotation rounds (i.e., a large n) becomes
independent of the spoofer’s modulation on the phase and
amplitude of the spoofed signal. Second, the variations of ¯A(cid:48)
i
of different spoofed signals are highly synchronized because
they have the same θ and ϕ. For legitimate GPS signals, the
different satellite position results in a different ϕi, which leads
to different variation patterns in ¯Ai for different satellites.
Spooﬁng Detection.
Based on the above reasoning, the
detection method works as follows. We ﬁrst map the CN0
measurements over multiple rotation rounds to the correspond-
ing angles. Then we ﬁt the Sine curve to derive AoAs (see
Figure 10b). With AoAs, we can simply apply the AoA-Dev
method developed in Section 5 for spooﬁng detection.
8.2 Method 2: Spectrum Analysis
The second method is to directly perform a spectrum analysis
on the CN0 measurements. The intuition is that, given the
attacker cannot perfectly guess the rotation speed and the ini-
tial facing angle of the GPS receiver, it means the modulated
signal and the rotation will have two different frequencies. As
a result, the received signal will be the product of these two,
and thus exhibits multiple peaks in the spectrum domain.
More speciﬁcally, according to Equ. (5), the received signal
A(cid:48)
i is the multiplication of two signal Gi(θ,ϕ + ∆) and Si(t∆).
Since our experiment results in Figure 3 has shown that CN0
measurements during rotation falls on a sinusoidal wave. We
can approximate Gi by
G ≈ M cos(υt + ϕi) +C,
(9)
where υ is the rotation speed, ϕi is the angle between the ori-
entation of the receiver and the satellite si. M is the amplitude
and C is the mean of G. The value of M is set based on the
material’s blockage effect. The better the blockage effect is,
the higher M will be. For legitimate signals, combining (9)
with (1) and (3), we have:
Ai(∆) = LiM[cos(υt + ϕi) +C],
(10)
which has only one peak at frequency υ.

For the adaptive spooﬁng signals, combining (9) with (1)
2π and modulation frequency fm := ωi
(11)
The above expression reveals two insights. First, a spec-
trum analysis on A(cid:48)
i will reveal four peaks at four frequencies:
fr + fm, fr − fm, fr and fm (we denote the rotation frequency
fr := υ
2π). Second, the
spectrum analysis will also reveal phases at these four fre-
quencies. Among them, phase ϕ at frequency fr is especially
critical since ϕi is the initial angle between the azimuth of
the receiver and the satellite i. The AoA of the signal can
be obtained by a1 − ϕi, where a1 is the GPS receiver’s initial
facing angle recorded by the smartphone’s IMU sensors.
Figure 11 shows an example of the spectrum analysis re-
sults (Spectrum Magnitude and Phase) on CN0 ﬁeld measure-
ments for an adaptive attack. In this example, the rotation
frequency fr is 0.125 Hz and the adversary’s modulation fre-
quency fm is 0.0625 Hz. Since fr − fm and fm both happen
to be 0.0625 Hz, the peak at fr − fm overlaps with the peak at
fm in the ﬁgure. Another peak at frequency fr is very visible
in the ﬁgure. Note that the peak supposed to be present at
fr + fm (0.1875 Hz) is not obvious because the coefﬁcient
MAi
2 at fr + fm is approximately 1
16 of the coefﬁcient MDi at fr
due to our Ai, Di, M, C parameter settings in this experiment.
Nevertheless, the takeaway is that spooﬁng signals will
produce multiple peaks in the spectrum domain in addition
to the peak at the rotation frequency fr. More importantly,
Figure 11 shows the phases of different satellites’ signals at
the rotation frequency fr are the same (i.e., ϕ), indicating that
these signals share the same AoA (hence they are spoofed).
We can use the initial facing angle (a1) to obtain AoA as
a1 − ϕi. Then we can apply the AoA-Dev method developed

spooﬁng signals (OA-H) within 8 seconds. The threshold

in Section 5 for spooﬁng detection. The detailed algorithm is
shown in Algorithm 3 in the Appendix.
9 Evaluation: Adaptive Spooﬁng Detection
In the following, we ﬁrst evaluate the adaptive spoofer against
the basic defense methods developed in Section 5 to show
the effectiveness of adaptive attacks. Then we apply the
advanced defense methods proposed in Section 8 and examine
their performance against adaptive attacks. If not otherwise
stated, the rotation speed of the receiver is around 0.1 Hz. As
mentioned before, we do not need to perfectly control the
rotation speed since our detection algorithms do not depend
on it. In this experiment, the guessed rotation speed by the
adaptive spoofer is 0.125 Hz. We also feed the adaptive
spoofer with the correct initial facing angle.
