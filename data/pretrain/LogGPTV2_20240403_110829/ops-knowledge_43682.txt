User:  company needs to encrypt its server to protect the security of sensitive data, please provide a secure encryption scheme.
Assistant: A secure encryption scheme uses end-to-end encryption technology to ensure that all data is encrypted using encryption algorithms during transmission and storage. The specific operation steps are as follows: 1. Select a suitable encryption algorithm, such as AES. 2. Establish a secure connection between the server and the client, such as the TLS/SSL protocol. 3. Encrypt all transmitted and stored data to ensure data security. 4. Set access control for the server, restricting only authorized users to access sensitive data on the server. 5. Regularly update encryption algorithms and access control policies to cope with changing security threats. While adopting this security encryption scheme, the server should also be regularly scanned and patched for security vulnerabilities to ensure that the server's software and systems are up-to-date and securely maintained.
