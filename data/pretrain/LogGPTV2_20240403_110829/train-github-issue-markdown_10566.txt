I had a deps file that looks like:
    export * as React from "https://dev.jspm.io/react";
    export * as ReactDOM from "https://dev.jspm.io/react-dom";
and then the file consuming it...
    import { React, ReactDOM } from "./deps.js";
    const rootEl = document.getElementById("root");
    ReactDOM.render(hello, world, rootEl);
I then ran `deno bundle mod.js app.bundle.js`. The outputted bundle was
missing the react and react-dom dependencies entirely. Changing my deps file
to the below fixed the issue:
    export { default as React } from "https://dev.jspm.io/react";
    export { default as ReactDOM } from "https://dev.jspm.io/react-dom";
I realize they don't mean the exact same thing but for `React` and `ReactDOM`,
it does. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. Thanks!
