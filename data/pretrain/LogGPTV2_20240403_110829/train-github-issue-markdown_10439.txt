The spec calls for a menu in the "cut/copy/paste" toolbar with additional
options for search/share/translate. It's unclear to me whether these 3 extra
options are fixed, or whether the application can decide which options to
provide.
In any case, we have no support for the `more` menu. We'll need to add it,
along with the transition animation.
