User: You need to replicate MySQL databases across data centers. Please explain how to create and configure a master-slave relationship using the replication plug-in officially provided by MySQL.
Assistant: To create and configure a master-slave relationship using the official replication plug-in provided by MySQL, you need to perform the following steps: 1. Make sure that both the master server and the slave server are installed with MySQL, and they are all under the same network and can access each other, because the replication process requires Network communication between master and slave. 2. On the primary server, modify the my.cnf file, enable binary logging (binlog), and specify the log file and location to be copied. The sample configuration is as follows: ``` [mysqld] log-bin=mysql-bin binlog-format=row server-id=1 ``` Here setting log-bin=mysql-bin means storing binary log files in the mysql data folder In the mysql-bin file in , binlog-format=row indicates that row-level replication is used instead of statement-level replication, and server-id=1 indicates that the unique identifier of the master server is 1. 3. On the slave server, modify the my.cnf file to enable replication and set the slave server's unique identifier. A sample configuration is as follows: ``` [mysqld] server-id=2 ``` 4. Create a MySQL user dedicated to replication on the master server and grant appropriate replication permissions. An example command is as follows: ``` CREATE USER 'repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; repl and authorize this user to access any database on any host with the given password ('%' stands for any hostname). The GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl'@'%' statement grants the user the appropriate replication privileges and uses the FLUSH PRIVILEGES statement to make the changes effective. 5. Execute the CHANGE MASTER TO statement on the slave server, specifying the address, port, log file name and location of the master server, and the credentials of the replication user. For example: ``` CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master_host_name', MASTER_PORT=3306, MASTER_USER='repl', MASTER_PASSWORD='password', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS=107; ``` This command will Connect from the server to the master server and specify the address, port, user and password of the master server. The MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS parameters specify from which binary log file and location the slave should start replicating. 6. Start the replication process on the slave server. The command is as follows: ``` START SLAVE; ``` This command will start the replication process between the slave server and the master server. 7. You can check the status of the replication process by using the SHOW SLAVE STATUS command, for example: ``` SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G ``` This command will display detailed information about the replication process, such as the status of the slave server, location etc. 8. Make sure data is being written on the master and read from the slave. Inserts, updates, and deletes on the master will be replicated proportionally by the slave. After completing these steps, you have established the master-slave replication relationship of the MySQL database and started replicating data between the master server and the slave server.
