### System info
  * Playwright Version: 1.31.2
  * Operating System: MacOS 13.2.1
  * Browser: Chromium
  * Other info:
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Config file**
    // playwright.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
    export default defineConfig({
      timeout: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      use: {
        acceptDownloads: true,
        actionTimeout: 5 * 1000, // 5 seconds
        trace: "retain-on-failure",
      },
      workers: 5,
      fullyParallel: true,
    });
**Test file (self-contained)**
    it('should timeout after 3 seconds', async ({ page }) => {
      page.goto("http://localhost:3000/");
      page.setDefaultTimeout(3 * 1000); // 3 seconds
      await page.waitForSelector('text="something not in the dom"')
    });
**Steps**
  * Run the test
  * Observe that it waits until the global test timeout of 15 minutes elapses
**Expected**  
According to the docs, the `page.setDefaultTimeout` value of 3 seconds should
kick in here.  
Also, according to this issue: #13723, the actionTimeout of 5 seconds should
also apply.
**Actual**
The only way I've been able to get this to timeout as expected is by passing
the option directly to `waitForSelector`.
