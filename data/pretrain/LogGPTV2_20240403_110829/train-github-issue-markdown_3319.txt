Does anyone know why this isn't working?
I'd like Webpack to load one directory of`.scss` files with `sass-loader`, and
the rest to use `postcss-loader`. I figured I could just have two sections in
my Webpack config that would test for `/\.scss$/`, using `exclude:
[...bootstrap folder...]` in the one that uses postcss and `include:
[...bootstrap folder...]` in the one that uses Bootstrap. But webpack seems to
completely ignore my second definition.
The motivation for this is I've found that the PostCSS Sass loader isn't able
to load Bootstrap v4, due to circular dependencies in its mixins (see my issue
on their project and numerous conversations with that group on Gitter.im). So
I'm trying to isolate the Bootstrap `.scss` files to load with the Sass
loader, which can do this. Webpack doc seems to suggest it's supported.
Here are my Scss loader sections:
    {
      test: /\.scss$/,
        exclude: [
        path.resolve(__dirname, '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss'),
        path.resolve(__dirname, '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins'),
        ],
      loaders: [
        'isomorphic-style-loader',
        'css-loader?' + (DEBUG ? 'sourceMap&' : 'minimize&') +
        'modules&localIdentName=[name]_[local]_[hash:base64:3]',
        'postcss-loader?parser=postcss-scss&pack=compile',
        'postcss-loader?pack=import',
      ],
    }, {
      test: /\.scss$/,
      include: [
        path.resolve(__dirname, '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss'),
        path.resolve(__dirname, '../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins'),
      ],
      loaders: [
        'isomorphic-style-loader',
        'css-loader?' + (DEBUG ? 'sourceMap&' : 'minimize&') +
        'modules&localIdentName=[name]_[local]_[hash:base64:3]',
        'sass-loader',
      ],
    }
And the errors are, for example:
        ERROR in ./~/css-loader?sourceMap&modules&localIdentName=[name]_[local]_[hash:base64:3]!./~/postcss-loader?parser=postcss-scss&pack=compile!./~/postcss-loader?pack=import!./src/components/App/App.scss
