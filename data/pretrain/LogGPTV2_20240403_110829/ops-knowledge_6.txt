User: Please explain what is Load Balancing (Load Balancing) and when do you need to use it?
Assistant: Load Balancing is a technology that distributes network traffic to multiple servers or computing resources to achieve balanced utilization of resources and improve performance and reliability. In a website or application with high concurrency, a large amount of data processing, and a huge amount of visits, a single server may not be able to satisfy all client requests. At this point, load balancing can be used to distribute network traffic and evenly distribute them to multiple servers, thereby improving system availability and performance. In enterprise applications, load balancing can also be used for fault tolerance and failover. If a server fails and it cannot handle client requests, a load balancer can automatically route traffic to other servers, ensuring continuity of service and high availability. All in all, load balancing needs to be used in the following situations: 1. High traffic and high concurrency environment 2. Scenarios that require fault tolerance and failover 3. Need to improve parallel processing performance 4. Application environments that need to achieve scalability 5. For large systems , need to implement network traffic monitoring and logging.
