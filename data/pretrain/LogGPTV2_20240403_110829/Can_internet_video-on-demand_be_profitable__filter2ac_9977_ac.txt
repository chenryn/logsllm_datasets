### Figure 7: 95th Percentile Rule for Server Bandwidth

**Figure 7** illustrates the 95th percentile value of server bandwidth for two different months: April 2006 and December 2006. According to this rule, the bandwidth cost increases from 1.23 Gbps in April to 2.20 Gbps in December. This 78.5% increase in operational cost can be attributed to the video quality upgrade and the growing popularity of the service. As more users spend more time watching Internet videos, they will demand longer videos and better quality, making it increasingly costly (if not prohibitive) to provide such services using a client-server architecture.

### 3. Theory of Peer-Assisted Video on Demand (VoD)

In this section, we develop simple mathematical models for peer-assisted VoD to gain broad insights into its design. In subsequent sections, we will combine these modeling insights with trace-based simulations to assess the full potential of P2P solutions.

#### User Model

We focus on a single on-demand video with a bitrate \( r \) bps. Users watching the video assist in redistributing it to other users. We classify users based on their upload link bandwidths. Let \( M \) denote the number of user types, where a type \( m \) user has an upload link bandwidth \( w_m \). Users arrive at the system following a Poisson process with parameter \( \lambda \). The probability that an arrival is a type \( m \) user is denoted by \( p_m \). Using the properties of compound Poisson processes, the user arrival model is equivalent to independent Poisson processes with parameters \( p_m \lambda \) for each user type \( m \), where \( 1 \leq m \leq M \).

The average upload bandwidth of an arriving user is given by:
\[
\mu = \sum_{m=1}^{M} p_m w_m
\]

Since a user may quit the video before it ends, skip portions, pause, or perform other interactive actions, the time a user remains in the system is random. Denote the expected sojourn time of a user in the system as \( \sigma \).

By Little's law, the expected number of type \( m \) users in the system in steady state is:
\[
\rho_m = p_m \lambda \sigma
\]

Thus, the average demand in steady state is:
\[
D = r \mu \lambda \sigma
\]

We define the system as being in surplus mode if the total supply \( S \) (the sum of all upload capacities) is greater than the demand \( D \), and in deficit mode if \( S < D \).

If \( S > D \), the server must make up the difference, and the average server rate is at least:
\[
\max(D - S, 0)
\]

This trivial bound is often too loose to be useful. To obtain a more insightful lower bound, we remove the ordering restrictions from the allocation policies, allowing a peer to feed content to any other peer, not just those who arrived after it. In this modified system, the entire aggregate capacity \( u_1 + u_2 + \cdots + u_n \) can be used, regardless of the arrival order. Water-leveling is optimal for this modified system, which always makes full use of the aggregate upload capacity and allocates bandwidth according to the water-leveling policy. This modified system will have a lower average server bandwidth than any prefetch policy for the original system. If a prefetching policy is close to this lower bound, it is nearly optimal.

### 3.4 Simulation Results

We developed a discrete-event simulator to study the performance of the water-leveling and greedy policies and compare them to the no-prefetching policy and the lower bound. We focus on the balanced mode, where there is the greatest potential for improvement with prefetch policies and where we expect VoD systems to operate in the future.

We fixed the user arrival rate at \( \lambda = 1 \) and varied the supply-demand ratio between 1/1.4 to 1.4. **Figure 8** shows the simulation results, and we make the following key observations:

- When the system operates in the balanced mode, prefetching can significantly reduce server bandwidth requirements by a factor of three or more. The balanced mode becomes wider for systems with a relatively small number of users.
- The greedy policy performs slightly better than the water-leveling policy.
- Both the greedy and water-leveling policies are very close to the lower bound, indicating that both policies are nearly optimal.

- **(b) Deficit Mode**

These results highlight the effectiveness of prefetching policies in reducing server bandwidth requirements in peer-assisted VoD systems.
