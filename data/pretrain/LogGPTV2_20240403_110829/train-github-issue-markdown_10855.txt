  * **Electron Version:**
    * 5.0.x
  * **Operating System:**
    * macOS 10.14.5
### Expected Behavior
Electron does not crash at exit.
### Actual Behavior
The notifications are sent well, i use the close() function to avoid
persistence in Notification Center.
By doing this every time I quit the application I have a message that warns me
that the application did not stop properly.
### To Reproduce
    const notif = new Notification({title: title, body: body, silent: true})
    notif.on('click', () => appEvent.emit('show-window'))
    notif.show()
    setTimeout(() => notif.close(), 10000)
After sending notification(s), close application (app.quit()) and the error
will appear.
To no longer have the error after quitting app, i do not use the function
close () but my application generates a lot of notifications and I would have
preferred to handle that.
