User: How to set up Nginx reverse proxy to forward requests to the backend server for processing?
Assistant: The steps are as follows: 1. Install Nginx Install Nginx on the Linux server through the package manager. For example, in the Ubuntu/Debian system, execute the following command: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx 2. Configure the Nginx reverse proxy to open the Nginx configuration file /etc /nginx/nginx.conf, find the server node under the http node, and add the following code block: server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend-serverip:port; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } In the above code block: - listen: The port number and protocol that Nginx listens to, for example, 80 indicates the HTTP port. - server_name: The host name or domain name that Nginx monitors. - location: The path to request matching, for example, "/" means to match all paths. - proxy_pass: The address and port number forwarded to the backend server. - proxy_set_header: Set request header information. 3. Restart the Nginx service After saving the configuration file, execute the following command to restart the Nginx service to make the modification take effect: sudo systemctl restart nginx 4. Test the reverse proxy to request the host name/domain name and path that Nginx monitors through a browser or curl and other tools , for example: curl http://example.com/test If the response content of the backend server is returned normally, it means the setting is successful.
