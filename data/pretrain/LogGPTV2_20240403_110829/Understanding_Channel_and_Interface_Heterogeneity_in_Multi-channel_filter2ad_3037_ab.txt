diﬀerences between the maximum and minimum over all links) is about 6 dBm
and the 90-percentile RSS range is about 12 dBm. Figure 3(b) shows the RSS
variation in the 802.11a testbed. In this case, the median RSS range is about
11 dBm and the 90-percentile RSS range is about 18 dBm. This is signiﬁcantly
higher than the variation of RSS in a single channel as noted previously. Ev-
idently, there are considerable variations in RSS values across channels. The
variation in the 802.11a testbed is higher. This is because the path loss charac-
teristics are frequency speciﬁc and the 802.11a band (5180-5825MHz) is much
wider compared to the 802.11g band (2412-2462MHz).
In both the plots, the horizontal arrow shows the RSS threshold values. Note
that many links the RSS range crosses the threshold indicating such links perform
poorly in some channels, while performing quite well in some others.
Now, it will be interesting to ﬁnd out whether there is any one channel that
is good for all links. In Figure 3(c) and 3(d), we show how many times each
channel is the best based on the RSS values considering all links studied. We
see that in both testbeds, there is no clear winner among channels. Each link
performs diﬀerently in diﬀerent channels. The RSS values are not correlated with

Some channels do exhibit better overall performance relative to their peers (e.g.,
channels 165 and 64 for 802.11a testbed). But generally speaking, any channel
could be the best for some link. This makes it impossible to judge which channels
to use for a given link without doing actual measurements on the links.
4 Interface Diversity
For a given link between two multi-radio nodes, the choice of actual radio inter-
faces to use for this link could impact the link performance. The reason for this
is two fold. First, there could be inherent manufacturing variations between the
interfaces even though they use the same card model. Second, the antennas for
the interfaces need to be situated at a distance to prevent radio leakage issues so
that the orthogonal channels do remain orthogonal in practice [8]. This makes the
actual distance between diﬀerent antenna pairs for the same node pair slightly dif-
ferent (noted in Section 2). This issue is more signiﬁcant in 802.11a as it provides
shorter ranges relative to 802.11g. On the other hand, 802.11a is indeed attractive
for multichannel work, as it provides many more orthogonal channels.
To understand the variations caused by interface selection, we study 20 links
(a subset of the 78 links studied before) in our 802.11a testbed using 16 possible
interface pairs for each link. We select the same channel (channel 64, one of the

good performing channels) for this measurement on all links in order to isolate
the eﬀect of interface selection.
Figure 4(a) shows the RSS values on all 16 possible interface pair combinations
for a sample link. Here we see that the RSS value varies between -60 dBm to
-85 dBm. Considering the RSS threshold (about −74 dBm), the link shown here
has a very poor delivery ratio when certain interfaces are used (e.g., 1 to 4).
However, some other interfaces would have a good delivery ratio (e.g., 3 to 1).
It is also interesting to note that we cannot say that a speciﬁc interface has poor
performance. For example, if we consider the interface 1 on the sender node, it
has varying performance based on the receiver interface.
In Figure 4(b), we show the range of variation in RSS values between the
16 possible interface combinations for each of the 20 links studied. Each bar
shows the maximum and minimum RSS value for each link considering all 16
combinations. Note the signiﬁcant variation in RSS values among diﬀerent in-
terface pairs. The median and 90-percentile RSS variation is about 12 dBm
and 16 dBm respectively. Also note that most of these ranges straddle the RSS
threshold (−74 dBm). This means the delivery performance can indeed signiﬁ-
cantly vary depending on the interface choices. A channel assignment algorithm
unaware of such variations can easily choose a bad interface pair for a link even
though there are better interface pairs that could be potentially used.
5 Channel Assignment Algorithm
In this section, we demonstrate the potential of using channel-speciﬁc link qual-
ity information in existing channel assignment algorithms to get better perfor-
mance. For this purpose, we modify the greedy channel assignment algorithm
proposed in [9] to use the channel-speciﬁc link quality information when assigning

Sample Runs

channels for links. The greedy channel assignment algorithm assigns channels
to links2 in a greedy fashion trying to minimize the overall interference in the
network. At the same time it satisﬁes the interface constraint, i.e., ensures that
the number of channels assigned to links incident on a node does not exceed the
number of interfaces on the node.
The channel assignment algorithm works as follows: Initially, none of the
links are assigned channels. The algorithm iterates through each link that is
not assigned a channel yet and chooses a feasible set of channels that obey the
interface constraint. From this feasible set of channels, it selects a channel that
minimizes the overall network interference which is modeled using a conﬂict
graph. The algorithm terminates when no further assignment of channels to
links can reduce the network interference. Note that among the channels in the
feasible set, it is often the case that more than one channel can lead to the
minimum interference. Since the algorithm is unaware of possible diﬀerence in
link quality in diﬀerent in channels, it chooses one channel arbitrarily. Note
that this is a singular limitation in all channel assignment algorithms in current
literature as they do not use channel speciﬁc link quality information to make a
choice. In the new version of the greedy channel assignment algorithm, we use the
channel-speciﬁc link quality information (e.g. RSS on diﬀerent channels) to make
this choice. Given RSS values are relatively stable, short term measurements
(one time or periodic) are good enough to estimate the link quality in diﬀerent
channels. These measurements can be done whenever the channel assignments
are recomputed. Estimating the periodicity of channel assignment depending on
the environment and channel conditions is one of our future work.
In our 802.11a multi-radio testbed, we use 7 orthogonal channels (channels 36,
44, 52, 60, 149, 157, 165) and 4 interfaces in each node to study the performance
of the channel assignment algorithm. In Figure 5, we show the performance of
the greedy channel assignment algorithm with and without the channel-speciﬁc
link quality information. We used periodic probes sent at 100 packets per second
in each channel for 1 second to measure the link quality in diﬀerent channels
2 Since it assigns channels to links directly, it is diﬃcult (but not impossible) to in-
corporate the interface-speciﬁc information in this algorithm. We consider exploring
the use of interface-speciﬁc information as a part of our future work.

on each link before running the greedy algorithm that uses channel-speciﬁc link
quality information. The horizontal axis shows 10 diﬀerent experimental runs.
In each run, we send back-to-back UDP packets on 10 randomly chosen links
simultaneously. The two versions of the channel assignment are used to assign
channels for these 10 links. For each channel assignment, the experiment is run
for 60 seconds and the aggregate number of packets received is measured. Note
that the channel assignment algorithm using the channel-speciﬁc link quality
information performs very well in all experimental runs compared to the case
when all channels are considered homogeneous. Except in two cases (runs 6
and 7), the improvements are quite substantial - varying between 2-8 times.
We noted that in the two cases where performance improvements are marginal,
use of channel-speciﬁc information did not result in a very diﬀerent channel
assignment. Overall, the average improvement was by a factor of about 3.
6 Related Work
There is a growing body of literature that use multiple channels to reduce in-
terference in wireless mesh networks [2,9,7]. Many of them use multi-radio solu-
tions [6,9,7] (and references therein) to eliminate the need for dynamic channel
switching. However, none of these works consider the variations in link qual-
ity depending on the channel or interface chosen for communication. Channels
are always assumed to be homogeneous and link quality to be independent of
interface selection or choice of channel.
Recently, Das et al [4] have observed variation in routing metrics in diﬀerent
channels in wireless mesh networks. However, their work primarily focuses on
comparing diﬀerent routing metrics and understanding their dynamics. In [5], the
author has observed variation in link quality in multiple channels when study-
ing interference maps in 802.11 networks. The paper studied one 802.11a link
and showed variation in delivery ratio in diﬀerent channels. Our work quantiﬁes
the variation in using diﬀerent channels and interface pairs using extensive mea-
surements in two diﬀerent mesh testbeds operating 802.11g and 802.11a bands
and using diﬀerent hardware platforms. We also show that the variations in link
quality are not correlated to frequency of the channels. We also experimentally
demonstrate that utilizing channel and interface-speciﬁc information in channel
assignment algorithms improves performance signiﬁcantly.
7 Conclusions
This paper presents a detailed measurement study of channel and interface het-
erogeneity in multi-radio wireless mesh networks using measurements from two
mesh testbeds using diﬀerent hardware platforms and frequency bands (2.4GHz
for 802.11g and 5GHz for 802.11a). We quantify the variation in link quality
when using diﬀerent channels and interface pairs and show that choosing the
right channel and interfaces for a link can improve its performances signiﬁcantly.
We also demonstrate that this variation is ‘non-trivial’ in the sense that same
98

channel does not perform uniformly well for all links, or the same interface does
not perform uniformly well for all other interfaces it is paired up with.
All prior channel assignment works in literature ignore this important as-
sumption. We demonstrate how the channel heterogeneity information can be
incorporated in an existing channel assignment algorithm to improve its per-
formance. An important future direction of our work is to develop methods
to measure these variations eﬃciently, understand how often they need to be
repeated and design channel assignment schemes that take both channel and
interface variations into account and come up with eﬃcient solutions.
