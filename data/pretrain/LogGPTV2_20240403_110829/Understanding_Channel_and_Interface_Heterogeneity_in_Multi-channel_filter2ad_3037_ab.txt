### Differences in RSS Values Across Channels

The difference between the maximum and minimum Received Signal Strength (RSS) values across all links is approximately 6 dBm, while the 90th percentile RSS range is about 12 dBm. Figure 3(b) illustrates the RSS variation in the 802.11a testbed, where the median RSS range is around 11 dBm and the 90th percentile RSS range is about 18 dBm. This indicates a significantly higher variation in RSS values compared to a single channel, as previously noted. Clearly, there are substantial variations in RSS values across different channels, with the 802.11a testbed showing higher variability. This is due to the frequency-specific path loss characteristics and the wider bandwidth of the 802.11a band (5180-5825 MHz) compared to the 802.11g band (2412-2462 MHz).

In both plots, the horizontal arrow represents the RSS threshold values. It is evident that many links cross this threshold, indicating poor performance in some channels and good performance in others.

### Channel Performance Across Links

It is intriguing to determine if there is a single channel that performs well for all links. Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the number of times each channel is the best based on RSS values for all studied links. The results indicate that no single channel consistently outperforms others. Each link exhibits different performance in different channels, and RSS values are not correlated with the channel frequency. If this were the case, channel 36 in the 802.11a band and channel 1 in the 802.11g band would have the best RSS values for all links. Some channels, such as 165 and 64 in the 802.11a testbed, do show better overall performance, but generally, any channel can be the best for a specific link. This makes it challenging to determine the optimal channel without conducting actual measurements.

### Interface Diversity in Multi-Radio Nodes

For a given link between two multi-radio nodes, the choice of radio interfaces can significantly impact link performance. This is due to two main factors: inherent manufacturing variations between interfaces, even if they use the same card model, and the need to position antennas at a distance to prevent radio leakage and maintain orthogonality. This issue is more pronounced in 802.11a, which has shorter ranges compared to 802.11g. However, 802.11a is advantageous for multichannel work because it provides more orthogonal channels.

To study the variations caused by interface selection, we examined 20 links in our 802.11a testbed using 16 possible interface pairs for each link. We used the same channel (channel 64, one of the better-performing channels) for all links to isolate the effect of interface selection.

Figure 4(a) shows the RSS values for all 16 possible interface pair combinations for a sample link, ranging from -60 dBm to -85 dBm. Considering the RSS threshold of about -74 dBm, certain interfaces (e.g., 1 to 4) result in very poor delivery ratios, while others (e.g., 3 to 1) perform well. It is also notable that a specific interface does not consistently perform poorly; its performance varies depending on the receiver interface.

Figure 4(b) illustrates the range of RSS values between the 16 possible interface combinations for each of the 20 links. The median and 90th percentile RSS variations are about 12 dBm and 16 dBm, respectively. Most of these ranges straddle the RSS threshold, indicating that delivery performance can vary significantly based on interface choices. A channel assignment algorithm unaware of these variations may choose a suboptimal interface pair, even when better options are available.

### Channel Assignment Algorithm

We demonstrate the potential of using channel-specific link quality information in existing channel assignment algorithms to improve performance. We modified the greedy channel assignment algorithm proposed in [9] to incorporate this information. The algorithm assigns channels to links in a way that minimizes overall network interference while satisfying interface constraints.

Initially, no links are assigned channels. The algorithm iterates through each unassigned link, choosing a feasible set of channels that respect the interface constraint. From this set, it selects a channel that minimizes network interference, modeled using a conflict graph. The process continues until no further channel assignment can reduce interference. In the modified version, we use channel-specific link quality information (e.g., RSS values) to make the channel selection. Given the relative stability of RSS values, short-term measurements are sufficient to estimate link quality in different channels.

In our 802.11a multi-radio testbed, we used 7 orthogonal channels (channels 36, 44, 52, 60, 149, 157, 165) and 4 interfaces per node to evaluate the performance of the channel assignment algorithm. Figure 5 compares the performance of the greedy channel assignment algorithm with and without channel-specific link quality information. We sent periodic probes at 100 packets per second in each channel for 1 second to measure link quality before running the algorithm. The horizontal axis shows 10 different experimental runs, each involving back-to-back UDP packets on 10 randomly chosen links. The channel assignment algorithm using channel-specific information performed significantly better in most runs, with improvements ranging from 2 to 8 times. In two cases (runs 6 and 7), the improvements were marginal, but the average improvement was about 3 times.

### Related Work

There is a growing body of literature on using multiple channels to reduce interference in wireless mesh networks [2,9,7]. Many studies use multi-radio solutions [6,9,7] to eliminate the need for dynamic channel switching. However, none of these works consider the variations in link quality based on the chosen channel or interface. Channels are typically assumed to be homogeneous, and link quality is considered independent of interface selection or channel choice.

Recently, Das et al. [4] observed variations in routing metrics across different channels in wireless mesh networks. Their work primarily focuses on comparing different routing metrics and understanding their dynamics. In [5], the author observed variations in link quality across multiple channels in 802.11 networks, showing differences in delivery ratios. Our work quantifies these variations using extensive measurements in two different mesh testbeds operating in the 802.11g and 802.11a bands. We also demonstrate that utilizing channel and interface-specific information in channel assignment algorithms can significantly improve performance.

### Conclusions

This paper presents a detailed measurement study of channel and interface heterogeneity in multi-radio wireless mesh networks, using data from two testbeds operating in different frequency bands (2.4 GHz for 802.11g and 5 GHz for 802.11a). We quantify the variation in link quality when using different channels and interface pairs and show that selecting the right channel and interfaces can significantly improve link performance. We also demonstrate that these variations are non-trivial, as the same channel does not perform uniformly well for all links, nor does the same interface perform uniformly well for all other interfaces it is paired with.

All prior channel assignment works in the literature ignore this important assumption. We show how incorporating channel heterogeneity information into an existing channel assignment algorithm can improve its performance. Future work will focus on developing efficient methods to measure these variations, understanding the required periodicity, and designing channel assignment schemes that account for both channel and interface variations.
