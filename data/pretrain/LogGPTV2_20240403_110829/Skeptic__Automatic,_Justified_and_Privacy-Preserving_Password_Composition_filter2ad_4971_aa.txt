## Abstract
The selection of a password composition policy for a password-protected system is a critical security decision that significantly affects the vulnerability of user-chosen passwords to guessing attacks. In practice, this choice is often based on intuition rather than rigorous analysis. This work proposes a novel methodology that leverages password probability distributions derived from large sets of real-world password data, filtered according to various password composition policies. By redistributing these probabilities, we simulate different user password reselection behaviors to automatically determine the policy that induces the most uniform distribution of user-chosen passwords, which we show to be a useful proxy for overall resistance to guessing attacks. Additionally, by fitting power-law equations to the generated distributions, we can justify our policy choices without accessing user password data. We introduce Skeptic, a software toolkit that implements this methodology, including a domain-specific language (DSL) to enable system administrators with no background in password security to compare and rank policies efficiently. Our approach, validated using 205,176,321 passwords across three datasets, aligns closely with findings from previous empirical studies.

## 1 Introduction
To enhance the resilience of a password-protected system against guessing attacks, password composition policies are crucial. These policies dictate which subset of possible passwords users can create. Historically, the selection of such policies has been non-rigorous, often based on intuition. This is concerning, as the restrictiveness of a policy does not necessarily correlate with the value of the assets it protects [14]. Therefore, a more rigorous method of selection is needed.

Previous studies have analyzed leaked datasets or collected passwords under specific policies, but these approaches have limitations. Leaked datasets may not represent exotic policies, and filtering them does not yield representative results [22]. Collecting data under controlled conditions lacks ecological validity and is resource-intensive. Both methods also raise privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose a methodology that automatically selects a suitable password composition policy, justifies the choice, and avoids propagating user password data. This is particularly important given the rise in phishing scams using previously leaked passwords [29].

In this work, we derive password probability distributions from large sets of leaked data and redistribute these probabilities to simulate different user reselection behaviors. We fit power-law curves to these distributions to quantify the additional guessing attack resistance provided by each policy. Using the uniformity of these distributions as a proxy for overall resistance, we maximize the practical utility of our data with the Password Composition Policy Assertion Language (Pacpal), a DSL for comparing and ranking policies.

Using three large-scale password breach datasets and 28 distinct policies, we rigorously and justifiably rank password composition policies. Our results strongly correlate with previous empirical studies, revealing interesting findings, such as the dramatic reduction in distribution uniformity with stricter policies if users converge on a few remaining permitted passwords. We also demonstrate that the Skeptic toolchain supports the specification of policies within the Coq proof assistant, ensuring they confer immunity to malware like Mirai and Conficker.

## 2 Related Work
There is a wealth of compromised password data available online. Weir et al. [36] used this data to examine the validity of using password entropy as defined in NIST SP800-63-1 [8], concluding that it is not a valid metric. This work highlights the use of breached datasets in password composition policy research. The Pwned Passwords web application [19] aggregates over 500 million unique exposed passwords, but blacklisting alone is inadequate, as unexposed passwords can still be weak. Studies like Shay et al. [31] recruit users to create passwords under various policies and run cracking attacks, considered the gold standard in this field. We replicate their results to validate our methodology.

Password choice varies significantly across demographics, making a one-size-fits-all policy impractical. Galbally et al. [16] emphasize that no single metric is ideal for all passwords under all conditions. Our methodology is designed to be attack-independent, providing a general idea of policy security when deployed in the wild. We assume attackers will guess common passwords first.

## 3 Methodology
### 3.1 Sourcing Human-Chosen Passwords
Given the variability in user password choice [5], our methodology uses an input set of password data representative of the user base. Input sets can be sourced from any user credential database where plaintext passwords are known. We use the following datasets:
- **RockYou:** Compromised in 2009, with a minimum length of 5 characters. Contains 32,603,048 passwords.
- **Yahoo:** Compromised in 2012, with a minimum length of 6 characters. Contains 453,492 passwords.
- **LinkedIn:** Compromised in 2012, with a minimum length of 6 characters. Contains 172,428,238 passwords.

#### 3.1.1 Data Cleansing
To ensure representativeness, each password must have been created under a known policy. We filter datasets to remove passwords created under old policies or non-password artifacts. Non-ASCII characters are removed to avoid encoding issues. Single sign-on flags and hexadecimal data are also removed. Table 1 shows the filtered dataset sizes.

| Dataset | Filtered Size | Removed |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| RockYou | 32,506,433     | 96,615 (0.30%) |
| Yahoo   | 434,287       | 19,205 (4.23%) |
| LinkedIn| 172,235,601   | 192,637 (0.11%) |

#### 3.1.2 Frequencies to Probabilities
Following Blocki et al. [3], given a cleansed input set \( I \) of \( N \) user passwords, let \( f_i \) denote the frequency of the \( i \)-th most common password and \( \text{pwd}_i \) the \( i \)-th most common password. The set \( I \) induces a probability distribution \( D \) over passwords defined as:
\[ D(p) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{f_i}{N} & \text{if } p = \text{pwd}_i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

This distribution allows us to simulate different user reselection behaviors and evaluate the uniformity of password distributions under various policies.
