## Chapter 1: Red Teaming and Red Teams Overview
**Contributor: Tony Kelly (@infosectdk)**

### What is a Red Team, and where did it come from?
The concept of Red Teams originated in the military, where it was recognized that to better defend, one must attack one's own defenses to identify weak points. This evolved into "War Games," where defenders (Blue Team) were pitted against aggressors (Red Team).

In the context of information security, Red Teams serve as a tool to help organizations better defend against hostile attackers by simulating real-world attacks. Despite their "offensive" nature, Red Teams are ultimately defenders, providing insights to improve an organization's security posture.

#### Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an attack.
â€” *The Art of War, Sun Tzu*

To effectively defend, one must understand how to attack and stop those attacks. Red Teaming, often referred to as Penetration Testing, is essential for evaluating an organization's security. Many organizations rely on Blue Teams (defenders) and conduct compliance-driven tests annually, which can leave them vulnerable. Red Teams, whether internal or external, challenge and evaluate the security posture, helping to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Blue Team vs. Red Team
- **Blue Teams**: Defenders who monitor and respond to threats. They are reactive, waiting for incidents to occur.
- **Red Teams**: Proactive, simulating real attackers to penetrate defenses undetected. They highlight gaps in defenses and improve detection capabilities for Blue Teams.

### External Independent Testing
External pen testing teams can be engaged in various capacities, including:
- **Physical Access Testing**: Testing access to buildings, social engineering, lockpicking, and security control evasion.
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, impersonation, tailgating, and drop attacks.
- **Network Infrastructure**: Firewall bypass, router testing, DNS footprinting, proxy servers, and vulnerability exploits.
- **Web Application Compromise**: Physical and cloud-based applications.
- **Wireless**: Configuration, unauthorized access points, default passwords, and encryption protocols.
- **Application Testing**: Databases, physical, and cloud.
- **Operating System Build Standards**: Server, desktop, and mobile.
- **IoT**: Internet of Things devices.

### In-House Red Teams
Internal Red Teams can work closely with Blue Teams or operate independently, providing probity in their activities. They test existing defenses, audit logs, assess published vulnerabilities, and evaluate risks. Their advantage lies in their familiarity with the organization's infrastructure.

### War Games
Red vs. Blue exercises can simulate real-world attacks. These can be structured in different ways, with the Red Team acting as external attackers or malicious insiders. Such exercises provide valuable lessons in incident response and help improve detection and response capabilities.

### Introduction
Before engaging in any hacking activities, a professional pentester must gather information about the target. This critical first step, known as OSINT, involves collecting publicly available information to find potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's defense system.

### What is OSINT?
*Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of using publicly available sources to collect information (i.e., intelligence) about persons or entities from a wide array of sources, including the Internet.*

### Phases of the OSINT Process
1. **Source Identification**: Identify potential information sources and document them.
2. **Data Harvesting**: Collect and harvest information from the selected sources.
3. **Data Processing and Integration**: Process and integrate the collected data.
4. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the processed information using OSINT tools.
5. **Results Delivery**: Present the findings to other members of the Red Team.

### OSINT Tools
There are numerous OSINT tools available, both free and paid. While it is not possible to cover every single tool, we will discuss some of the more popular ones that are useful for Red Team operations.

### Example: Google Searching & Dorking
For instance, if you are hired to pentest a company called Exploration Media Group, you might start with a Google search to find the company's website domain name. From there, you can use OSINT tools to gather more detailed information.
