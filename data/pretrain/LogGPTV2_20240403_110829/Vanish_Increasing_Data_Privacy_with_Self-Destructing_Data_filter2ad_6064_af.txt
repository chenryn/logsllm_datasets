fense against Sybil attacks by constraining the identity
of a Vuze node to a function of its IP address and port
modulo 1999. While this measure might be sufﬁcient
for the early stages of a Vanish deployment, stronger
defenses are known, e.g., certiﬁed identities [26] and
periodic cryptographic puzzles [9] for defense against
Sybil attacks and various other defenses against Eclipse
attacks [14, 51]. Given that the core Vanish system
is network-agnostic, we could easily port our system
onto more robust DHTs implementing stronger defenses.
Moreover, if Vanish-style systems become popular, it
would also be possible to consider Vanish-speciﬁc de-
fenses that could leverage, e.g., the aforementioned tight
coupling between Vanish and the identities provided by
PGP public keys. Finally, while we have focused on the
Vuze DHT — and indeed its communal model makes
analyzing security more interesting and challenging —
Vanish could also split keys across multiple DHTs, or
even DHTs and managed systems, as previously noted
(Section 4). The different trust models, properties, and
risks in those systems would present the attacker with a
much more difﬁcult task.
7 Related Work
We have discussed a large amount of related work in
Section 2 and throughout the text. As additional re-
lated work, the Adeona system also leverages DHTs
for increased privacy, albeit with signiﬁcantly different
goals [55]. Several existing companies aim to achieve
similar goals to ours (e.g., self-destructing emails), but
with very different threat models (company servers must
be trusted) [20]. Incidents with Hushmail, however, may
lead users to question such trust models [59]. There also
exists research aimed at destroying archived data where
the data owner has the ability to explicitly and manu-
ally erase extra data maintained elsewhere, e.g., [8]; we
avoid such processes, which may not always succeed or
may be vulnerable to their own accidental copying or
disclosures. Finally, albeit with different goals and per-
spectives, Rabin proposes an information-theoretically
secure encryption system that leverages a decentralized
collection of dedicated machines that continuously serve
random pages of data [52], which is related to the lim-
ited storage model [33]. Communicants, who pre-share
symmetric keys, can download and xor speciﬁc pages to-
gether to derive a one-time pad. The commonality be-
tween our approach and Rabin’s is in the use of exter-
nal machines to assist in privacy; the model, reliance
on dedicated services, and pre-negotiation of symmetric
keys between communicants are among the central dif-
ferences.
8 Conclusions
Data privacy has become increasingly important in our
litigious and online society. This paper introduced a
new approach for protecting data privacy from attackers
who retroactively obtain, through legal or other means, a
user’s stored data and private decryption keys. A novel
aspect of our approach is the leveraging of the essen-
tial properties of modern P2P systems, including churn,
complete decentralization, and global distribution un-
der different administrative and political domains. We
demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by present-
ing Vanish, a proof-of-concept prototype based on the
Vuze global-scale DHT. Vanish causes sensitive infor-
mation, such as emails, ﬁles, or text messages, to irre-
versibly self-destruct, without any action on the user’s
part and without any centralized or trusted system. Our
measurement and experimental security analysis sheds
insight into the robustness of our approach to adversarial
attacks.
Our experience also reveals limitations of existing
DHTs for Vanish-like applications.
In Vuze, for ex-
ample, the ﬁxed data timeout and large replication fac-
tor present challenges for a self-destructing data system.
Therefore, one exciting direction of future research is to
redesign existing DHTs with our speciﬁc privacy appli-
cations in mind. Our plan to release the current Vanish
system will help to provide us with further valuable ex-
perience to inform future DHT designs for privacy appli-
cations.
