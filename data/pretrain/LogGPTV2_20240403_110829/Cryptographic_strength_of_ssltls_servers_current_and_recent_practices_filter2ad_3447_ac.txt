example, Table 8 shows that 165 servers support DES with
at most 64 bit keys. Prudence would indicate that support
of such weak keys should be removed altogether.
Triple DES (3-DES) is a variant of DES where the DES
algorithm is applied three times using three diﬀerent keys.
The eﬀective key length is thus 168 bits, which protects
against brute force attacks, but 3-DES is slower than other
ciphers and is slowly being phased out [33]. Most of the
servers we surveyed support 3-DES, using cipher block chain-
ing (CBC).

Table 9: RC2 Support
Another block cipher is RC2, which was developed by
Rivest in 1987. RC2 was originally developed for a 40-bit
key, and is a bit slower than other ciphers. For appropriate
key lengths (128 bits or greater) it is still considered secure
[25].
Table 9 shows the key strengths supported by servers em-
ploying RC2. Most servers support 128 bit keys, but a sig-
niﬁcant number of servers also support the weak 56 and 40
bit key sizes. Table 10 shows the maximum key strength
used by servers that support RC2. Over 8 percent of the
servers exclusively support weak RC2 keys.
The most commonly supported symmetric key cipher is
RC4, which was developed by Rivest in 1987. RC4 is a
stream cipher, which encrypts one bit at time. A num-
ber of attacks on RC4 have been published, and there are
ways of implementing RC4 within a cryptosystem that are
completely insecure [19]. Fortunately, it is used correctly in
SSL/TLS. As with DES, 40, 56, and 64-bit keys are insecure,
and 128-bit keys are considered secure.
Table 11 shows the key strengths supported by servers
utilizing RC4. As can be seen, nearly all servers support
128 bit keys, and very many support 40 bit keys. Table

Table 11: RC4 Support
12 shows the maximum key strength employed by servers
supporting RC4. A small fraction support only weak key
sizes.
The newly favored symmetric encryption algorithm is the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [31], since it is the
new government standard intended to replace DES. AES
was the winning proposal among 15 considered in a 2001
competition. AES is generally considered secure, although
there are some concerns about potential attacks [12].
Table 13 shows the distribution of key size support for
servers using AES. Even though AES has only been deﬁned
for a few years, it is encouraging to see that over 56 percent
of the servers support AES-256. Oddly enough, there are
only a small number of sites supporting AES with both 128
or 256 bits.
4.6 Default Choices
While most of the servers we surveyed support weak cryp-
tography, we suspect that they do so to accept the largest
number of connections, despite the security vulnerabilities.
Thus, we probed the servers specifying the full range of ci-
pher suites to see what they chose by default (as there is
no excuse for choosing a weaker option than the server sup-
ports). Unfortunately, 552 of the 19,429 servers did not
respond properly, thus the following numbers are for the
remaining 18,887 servers.
Only three servers chose a weaker protocol when a stronger
one was available. In particular, they chose SSL 2.0 when
SSL 3.0 was available. All servers that supported TLS, chose
to use TLS. Similarly, only four (diﬀerent) servers chose to
use a weaker public key size than they supported.
When it came to choosing between the two possible hash
functions, 315 servers only supported one of MD5 and SHA-
1, and thus had no choice. Of those that supported both,
5469 (29 percent of all servers) chose MD5.
As shown in Table 14, none of the servers chose RC2 from
the available symmetric encryption algorithms. However,
657 servers that support AES (namely about 6 percent of
those that support AES) did not choose AES by default.
The combined cipher suite choices are shown in Table 15.
AES-256 with SHA-1 was the most popular choice, while
RC4-128 with MD5 and 3-DES with SHA-1 were second
and third.

over time, we conducted tests on February and August of
2005 and June and November of 2006.
As seen in Table 16, there are promising trends in SSL
version support. During this time period, the number of
servers supporting SSL 2.0 was reduced by over 9 percentage
points.
We also found similarly heartening news with the change
in symmetric cipher support (Table 17) as the number of
servers supporting AES grew by nearly 16 percentage points.
Finally, we also note that small public key sizes are slowly
losing support (Table 18), while larger ones, in particular
2048-bit keys, are supported by a couple more servers. How-
ever, while this is a change in the right direction, it is too
small for comfort: The fraction of servers supporting weak
key sizes is still signiﬁcant at about 5 percent (compared to
about 7 percent in our earlier runs).
Overall, while the trend is certainly positive, it may be
too slow. For example, continuing at the same rate, it will
take quite a few years until the support of SSL2 is mostly
abolished.
5. RELATED WORK
In 2001, Murray presented a survey of SSL servers [27].
Murray’s survey generally covered similar issues as in this
paper, though in less detail.
In addition, it also consid-
ered whether or not a server’s certiﬁcate was expired or self-
signed.
Murray deﬁned weak servers to be those that supported
at least one of the following ﬂaws: 1) only supports SSL
2.0; 2) only supports symmetric encryption using keys with
at most 56 bits; 3) only supports certiﬁcate key sizes of at
most 512 bits; 4) uses an expired or self-signed certiﬁcate.
Murray deﬁned strong servers to be those that supported
all of the following properties: 1) supports SSL 3.0 or TLS
(can support SSL 2.0); 2) supports symmetric encryption
using keys with at least 64 bits (can support 40-bit keys);
3) supports certiﬁcate key sizes of at least 1024 bits (can
support smaller certiﬁcate keys). Finally, the rest of the
servers are considered to have a medium level of security.
Note that the levels of security deﬁned by Murray would
not be considered valid today, as new developments in secu-
rity have rendered several cryptosystems insecure that were
previously considered secure. Moreover, servers that sup-
port both strong and weak cryptography are called “strong”
here, while today to provide strong security a server should

arguably support only reasonably strong cryptography (and
not support any weak options), as previously discussed.
Table 19 shows a comparison between Murray’s 2000 and
2001 surveys and our 2006 survey, using Murray’s deﬁnitions
to allow for comparison. The numbers are not completely
comparable, as Murray surveyed 8081 servers while we ex-
amined 19,429. Another diﬀerence is that we did not con-
sider expired or self-signed certiﬁcates. The dramatic trend,
however, is the reduction in the percentage of weak servers,
and the rise in the percentage of strong servers. This trend is
exhibited when we compare several speciﬁc aspects directly
(Table 20). This is consistent with our results (Section 4.7)
indicating the same positive trend (though less dramatically)
over the last 2 years.
Scanning Approaches to Security
Scanning large numbers of servers is a common approach to
testing server security. Nmap [3] is a well-known security
scanning tool. Provos and Honeyman [35] scanned about
2300 SSH servers to determine which version of SSH was
being used. Similarly, Rescorla [37] probed 891 SSL servers
that used the OpenSSL library to see if they were vulnerable
to a bug in OpenSSL, and whether that vulnerability was
being addressed. Our study diﬀers from the above in that
it focuses on cryptographic security rather than software
vulnerabilities.
SSL/TLS Performance Studies
Researchers have also recently studied the performance of
SSL servers [6, 10, 36]. In these studies, an SSL site is set
up in a lab and evaluated. Each of these studies made cer-
tain choices about the algorithms used and the key sizes
employed. For example, Apostolopoulos et al. [6] varied the
RSA key size between 512 bits and 1024 bits, and studied
the DES, 3-DES, RC4, MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms. Coarfa
et al. [10] used RSA with a key size of 1024, RC4 with 128-
bit keys and MD5. Rescorla varied RSA key sizes from 512
bits to 2048 bits, while studying RC4, DES, 3-DES, SHA-1,
and MD5. While these studies were appropriate for their

times, our results suggest that any future performance stud-
ies should likely look at stronger key sizes (e.g., 2048 for
RSA) and current best practice algorithms (e.g., AES and
SHA-1).
