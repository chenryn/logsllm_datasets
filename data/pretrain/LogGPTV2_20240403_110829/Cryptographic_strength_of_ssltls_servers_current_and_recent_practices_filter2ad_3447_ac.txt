### Analysis of Cryptographic Support and Trends in SSL/TLS Servers

#### 1. DES and 3-DES
Table 8 indicates that 165 servers support DES with at most 64-bit keys. Given the weakness of these keys, it is advisable to discontinue their support entirely. Triple DES (3-DES) is a variant of DES where the algorithm is applied three times using three different keys, resulting in an effective key length of 168 bits. This provides protection against brute force attacks, but 3-DES is slower than other ciphers and is being phased out [33]. Most surveyed servers support 3-DES, often using cipher block chaining (CBC).

#### 2. RC2
RC2, developed by Rivest in 1987, was originally designed for 40-bit keys and is slightly slower than other ciphers. For key lengths of 128 bits or greater, RC2 is still considered secure [25]. Table 9 shows the key strengths supported by servers using RC2. The majority of servers support 128-bit keys, but a significant number also support the weaker 56 and 40-bit key sizes. Table 10 highlights the maximum key strength used by servers supporting RC2, with over 8% of servers exclusively supporting weak RC2 keys.

#### 3. RC4
The most commonly supported symmetric key cipher is RC4, also developed by Rivest in 1987. RC4 is a stream cipher that encrypts one bit at a time. While there are known vulnerabilities in RC4, it is generally used correctly in SSL/TLS. Keys of 40, 56, and 64 bits are insecure, while 128-bit keys are considered secure. Table 11 shows the key strengths supported by servers using RC4, with nearly all servers supporting 128-bit keys and many supporting 40-bit keys. Table 12 illustrates the maximum key strength employed by servers supporting RC4, with a small fraction supporting only weak key sizes.

#### 4. AES
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [31] is the newly favored symmetric encryption algorithm, intended to replace DES. AES was selected as the winning proposal among 15 candidates in a 2001 competition and is generally considered secure, although some potential attacks have been identified [12]. Table 13 shows the distribution of key size support for servers using AES. Despite AES being relatively new, over 56% of servers support AES-256. However, only a small number of sites support both 128 and 256-bit AES keys.

#### 5. Default Choices
Most servers support weak cryptography to accommodate a wide range of connections, despite security vulnerabilities. We probed the servers to determine their default choices. Of the 19,429 servers, 552 did not respond properly, leaving 18,887 servers for analysis. Only three servers chose SSL 2.0 when SSL 3.0 was available, and all servers that supported TLS chose to use TLS. Four servers chose to use a weaker public key size than they supported. When choosing between MD5 and SHA-1, 315 servers supported only one, and 5469 (29% of all servers) chose MD5. Table 14 shows that none of the servers chose RC2, but 657 servers that support AES did not choose AES by default. Table 15 lists the combined cipher suite choices, with AES-256 with SHA-1 being the most popular, followed by RC4-128 with MD5 and 3-DES with SHA-1.

#### 6. Changes in Support Over Time
To study the evolution of SSL use, we conducted tests in February and August 2005, and June and November 2006. Table 16 shows a reduction in the number of servers supporting SSL 2.0 by over 9 percentage points. Table 17 indicates an increase in the number of servers supporting AES by nearly 16 percentage points. Table 18 shows a slow decline in the support of small public key sizes, with a slight increase in support for 2048-bit keys. However, the fraction of servers supporting weak key sizes remains significant at about 5%.

#### 7. Related Work
In 2001, Murray conducted a survey of SSL servers [27], covering similar issues but in less detail. Murray defined weak servers as those supporting only SSL 2.0, symmetric encryption with keys up to 56 bits, certificate key sizes up to 512 bits, or using expired or self-signed certificates. Strong servers supported SSL 3.0 or TLS, symmetric encryption with keys of at least 64 bits, and certificate key sizes of at least 1024 bits. Table 19 compares Murrayâ€™s 2000 and 2001 surveys with our 2006 survey, showing a reduction in weak servers and an increase in strong servers. Table 20 further supports this positive trend.

#### 8. Scanning Approaches to Security
Scanning large numbers of servers is a common method for testing server security. Nmap [3] is a well-known security scanning tool. Provos and Honeyman [35] scanned 2300 SSH servers, and Rescorla [37] probed 891 SSL servers for OpenSSL vulnerabilities. Our study focuses on cryptographic security rather than software vulnerabilities.

#### 9. SSL/TLS Performance Studies
Recent studies have evaluated the performance of SSL servers [6, 10, 36]. These studies varied the RSA key size and algorithms used. For example, Apostolopoulos et al. [6] used RSA key sizes from 512 to 1024 bits and studied DES, 3-DES, RC4, MD5, and SHA-1. Coarfa et al. [10] used RSA with 1024-bit keys, RC4 with 128-bit keys, and MD5. Rescorla varied RSA key sizes from 512 to 2048 bits and studied RC4, DES, 3-DES, SHA-1, and MD5. Future performance studies should consider stronger key sizes and current best practice algorithms.
