9 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
We briefly discuss some additional issues that we did not
cover in the rest of this paper.
RF tuning and hardware optimization: We expect that
the performance of Morpho can be increased substantially
with better RF optimization. Other work has reported tens
of meters backscatter range and higher sensitivity passive
detectors [18, 33, 49, 52]. Such improvements can extend
our techniques to larger sized areas (e.g. multiple rooms
or a home), and also allow us to reduce carrier transmit
power levels such that battery-powered mobile devices like
smartphones can take the role of the central station.
Frequency-hopping in Morpho: The main issue to con-
sider when extending our architecture to frequency-hopping
spread spectrum radios is the fact that passive radios are not
frequency selective. Frequency hopping can be enabled on
the passive transmitter side (i.e. backscatter), by leveraging
frequency shifting and recent advances in single-sideband
backscattering [20]. These methods only add a small amount
of complexity and power to our design. One area that needs
more research to complete this design is the question of
how to endow the passive receiver with similar frequency
hopping capabilities.
One way to circumvent this issue is to use a dedicated
channel for passive communication, and allow active commu-
nication to proceed with frequency hopping. The advantage
of such decoupling is that we can use passive components
like a SAW filter tuned to the specific channel before the
passive receiver to make it frequency selective [17]. But this
method restricts us to a single channel for passive communi-
cation which might be scalable to large networks.
10 RELATED WORK
We briefly review relevant related work that we have not
highlighted in previous sections.
Multi-radio wireless networks: There has been much
work on the general idea of multi-radio wireless radios. This
work has explored many combinations including Bluetooth
+ WiFi [1, 5, 37], WiFi + LTE [7, 10, 26], and WiFi + 60 GHz
[47]. This work has leveraged multi-radio combinations for
energy-efficiency [1, 15, 21, 24, 25], traffic management [14],
mobility management [38], and routing management [2, 11].
While there is similarity between these efforts and ours
at a high level, the crucial difference is that we are design-
ing an multi-radio system that operates at ultra-low power
regimes between 1 µW to 1 mW, and can switch at micro-
second granularity to react to highly dynamic channels. This
is a completely different design space and necessitates re-
thinking all layers of the stack.
Active-Passive radios: There has been some recent work
that explores integration of active and passive components,
albeit in restricted ways. In terms of receiver side integration,
recent work on wakeup radios integrate passive envelope de-
tectors with active receivers to enable extremely low power
remote wakeup [44, 45]. In terms of transmitter side integra-
tion, a recent short paper looks at reusing hardware elements
between 10 Mbps BPSK Backscatter and 1Mbps Bluetooth
[43]. A couple of approaches have explored integration at
higher layers of the stack as well. One is BLISP [19], which
we have previously discussed. Another is Braidio [17], which
leverages active and passive components for power offload
by shifting carrier generation between end-points. Our work
shows how such active-passive radio components can be
leveraged in every aspect of communication including data
transfer, measurement, and control messages.
Backscatter communication: There has been significant
activity in backscatter communication in recent years. A
significant fraction of this work has focused on repurposing
ambient carriers such as Bluetooth [12, 20, 57], WiFi [8, 23,
36, 54ś57], Zigbee [20, 57], FM [51], and LoRA [48] to enable
backscatter communication. Recent work has also shown
that it is possible to use backscatter for applications like low-
power HD video streaming [33]. However, the issue of how
to deal with the inherent flakiness of passive radios under
channel dynamics has received very little attention. Morpho
bridges this gap.
11 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we present a new architecture for low-power
radios that leverages passive and active components in a
tightly intertwined manner to improve performance. In con-
trast to duty-cycling based radios that aim to maximize sleep
times to save power, polymorphic radios leverage passive
modes to save power. This is a new paradigm that is particu-
larly useful for low-power radios that are used in streaming
mode to transmit data from or to wearable, IoT, and mobile
devices. We instantiate our ideas in a full hardware-software
stack that we call Morpho, and show that we can get up to
an order of magnitude improvements in energy-efficiency
while still being robust to channel fluctuations.
