Hello there. Are there any plans for including official community-supported
translations for React docs? At @translaiton-gang we've just completed Vue.js`
docs Russian translation, and we also have some progress with React ones. I
believe, at least Japanese and Chinese communities would also like to have
their own translations. So, could we integrate it somehow?
UPD: I see some random translation files under `docs/community`. Is it how
it's done now? How is the document version to display being detected? I mean,
I can't see any header dropdown language choice or something.
