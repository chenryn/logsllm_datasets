User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What should I do when my boss asks me to fabricate audit log data? My boss just asked me to create a fictitious log entry to say that a user's account was updated before it was, to win a dispute.

I feel this is not right because I am trying to start a career in working with data technology. Whether or not I get caught, the integrity of my data will be questionable, and my character compromised.

What would be the best way to handle this?

I have a far more professional company wanting to pick me up, and they are willing to hold the position for me until I finish the project at my current job. We are roughly a month out; should I cut and run now?

Sorry this is a little off topic, but I know some established professionals frequent here, and just need to know the best way to go about handling this with character.

Assistant: Ask your boss to put the request in writing before you do it.

Make sure to keep a copy of the request in your own personal files. Ideally a paper copy at home, or maybe an email in your own personal email account.

You say that you already have a better job to go to, so just give your notice now and leave the company as soon as the notice period is up. Presumably you have a notice period? A contract of employment?

If you don't have a better job to go to, then find one as fast as you can.
