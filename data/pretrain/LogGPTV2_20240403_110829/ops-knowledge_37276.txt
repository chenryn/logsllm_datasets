When faced with a request to fabricate audit log data, it's important to handle the situation with integrity and professionalism. Here’s a structured approach to address this issue:

### 1. **Understand the Request**
   - **Clarify the Intent:** Ask your boss to provide a detailed explanation of why they are requesting the fabrication of log data. Understanding the context might help in finding a more ethical solution.
   - **Request in Writing:** Politely ask your boss to put the request in writing. This not only documents the request but also provides you with a clear record of the conversation.

### 2. **Evaluate the Consequences**
   - **Professional Integrity:** Fabricating data compromises your professional integrity and can have long-term consequences for your career.
   - **Legal and Ethical Implications:** Consider the legal and ethical implications of altering audit logs. Such actions can lead to serious repercussions, including potential legal action and damage to your reputation.

### 3. **Communicate Your Concerns**
   - **Express Your Concerns:** Clearly and professionally communicate your concerns to your boss. Explain that fabricating data is against your professional ethics and could have significant negative consequences.
   - **Propose Alternatives:** Suggest alternative solutions that do not involve falsifying data. For example, you could propose a review of the existing data or a re-evaluation of the dispute based on the available evidence.

### 4. **Document Everything**
   - **Keep Records:** Ensure you keep a copy of all communications related to this request. Store these records in a secure location, such as a personal email account or a physical file at home.
   - **Consult HR (if necessary):** If your boss insists on the request and you feel uncomfortable, consider consulting your company’s HR department for guidance and support.

### 5. **Consider Your Next Steps**
   - **Evaluate Your Options:** Given that you have a better job offer and they are willing to hold the position for you, you may want to consider leaving your current job.
   - **Give Notice:** If you decide to leave, follow the proper procedures for giving notice. Ensure you fulfill any contractual obligations and maintain a professional demeanor during the transition period.

### 6. **Plan Your Exit Strategy**
   - **Notice Period:** Check your contract to understand your notice period requirements. Inform your new employer about your expected start date and ensure a smooth transition.
