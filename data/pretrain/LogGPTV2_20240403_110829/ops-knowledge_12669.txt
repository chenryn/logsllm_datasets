User: In cygwin I can't upgrade pip, it worked find in cmd:
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
 /usr/bin/python: No module named pip
Assistant: Likely you don't need the python -m part. If pip is in your path, then just typing pip install --upgrade pip should work. Where is pip installed? which pip will tell you where it's located, if it's in your path
