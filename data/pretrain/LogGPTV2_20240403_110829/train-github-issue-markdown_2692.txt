Code for Flash (code not changed)  
`// Specify flash path, supposing it is placed in the same directory with
main.js. const pluginList = { 'win32': '/legacy/pepflashplayer.dll', 'darwin':
'/legacy/PepperFlashPlayer.plugin', 'linux': '/legacy/libpepflashplayer.so' }
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('ppapi-flash-path', path.join(__dirname,
pluginList[process.platform]))`
