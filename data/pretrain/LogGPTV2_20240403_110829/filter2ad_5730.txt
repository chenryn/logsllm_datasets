Abstract 
Wireless  networks  of  low-power  sensing  devices  are 
poised  to  become  a  ubiquitous  part  of  the  computing 
landscape.    Proposed  applications  of  these  networks 
range from health care to warfare.  The challenge for 
the  information  security  community  is  to  develop  the 
common  security  services  (confidentiality,  integrity, 
etc.)  for  sensor  networks  in  a  manner  that  meets  the 
very  strict  resource  constraints  of  these  devices.  This 
forum  will  describe  a  broad  range  of  on-going 
research  efforts  in  order  to  acquaint  the  general 
information  security  community  with  the  issues  and 
concerns of sensor net security.

These  research  efforts  are  culminating  in  programs

relatively  more  powerful  base  stations  or  relay  points 
that serve to connect the sensor network to the outside 
world.  In other instances, the sensor nodes themselves 
serve  as  dynamic  relay  points.    Current  commercial

Efficient  versions of public key cryptography

broadcast  authentication  protocols  (such  as 
µTESLA [3]) have been devised.

•  Limited acceptance of vulnerabilities.
Sensor  net  security  services  have  been 
designed  to  accept  specific  vulnerabilities 
when  they  are  compatible  with  application 
goals  and  provide  performance  advantages.  
Examples  are  reduced  computational  rounds 
in symmetric encryption computation and key 
management protocols that rely on an initially 
unauthenticated message. 
The  forum  participates  will  describe  their  own  efforts 
to  create  and  deploy  security  services  in  ad  hoc 
networking  environments  and  their  vision  for  the 
future. 
This  includes  “bootstrapping  protocols”  that  enable 
devices  to  establish  secure  local  links  with  their 
neighbors  in  a  short  time  period  after  the  network  is 
deployed.
