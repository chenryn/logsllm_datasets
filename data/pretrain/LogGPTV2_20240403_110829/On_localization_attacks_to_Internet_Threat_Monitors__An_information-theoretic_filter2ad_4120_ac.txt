and spatial attacks in Sections IV and V, respectively.
I~ Detection of Temporal Attack
In this section, we first show that centralized detection is
ineffective against temporal attacks. Then, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of distributed detection against temporal
attacks.
A. Centralized Detection
the defender at
Recall that in a temporal attack, an attacker embeds
an n-bit signal into the probing traffic and launches the
probing traffic to a single monitor Mj. For centralized
detection,
the data center observes the
aggregated traffic rate from all monitors and compares its
distribution with a priori distribution of background noise
traffic. Theorem 1 shows the performance of centralized
detection against a temporal attack. The detailed proof can
be found in [22].
Theorem 1: When a defender uses the centralized de(cid:173)
tection, the minimum time length required by the attacker
to successfully identify a monitor is

{3 is the
V1i
detection rate for the defender and 8 is the false positive
rate upper-bound for the defender to set the detection
parameters. Furthermore, there always exists a signal that
allows the attacker to achieve this minimum time length.
We now illustrate the results with practical examples.
In particular, when the background traffic satisfies the
Gaussian distribution and 8 = 1%, (3 = 2%, t c = 20
minutes, the minimum time length l
is 5 hours. Notice
that such a short time length is acceptable for attackers
in practice. Hence, centralized detection cannot effectively

defend against
temporal attacks. Note that centralized
detection is effective against temporal attacks using a 1(cid:173)
bit attack signals [12], [13] because the attacker has to use
a 5/0.3 ~ 16-bit code to launch the attack based on the
above example.
B. Distributed Detection
We now consider distributed detection against tempo(cid:173)
ral attacks. Recall that in the distributed detection, each
monitor will individually perform anomaly detection on
its monitored traffic. Theorem 2 shows the effectiveness
of distributed detection against the temporal attacks. The
detailed proof can be found in [22].
Theorem 2: When the defender uses distributed detec(cid:173)
tion, the minimum time length required by the attacker to
successfully identify a monitor is

in terms of lag T. (iv) Making
a decision. After the estimations of correlation degree
q> (T), an appropriate decision rule is applied to determine
whether the traffic is modulated by the same code or not.
An intuitive decision rule is: if q> (T) demonstrates high
spikes,
then the traffic is modulated by the same attack
signal, e.g., PN-code.
Theorem 4 shows the effectiveness of hybrid detection
against the spatial attack. The detailed proof can be found
in [22].
Theorem 4: When the defender uses the hybrid detec(cid:173)
tion to monitor the self-similarity of traffic from multiple
monitors,
the minimum time length required by the at(cid:173)
tacker to successfully identify a monitor is
l > ntc =
- Clog (1 + n~~f))
2ntc
.

where n(l5, (3) and other parameters are the same as tjpse
defined in Theorem 1. Furthermore, there always exist a
signal that allows the attacker to achieve this minimum
time length.
We again illustrate the results of the theorem with the
same example in Section V-B. According to Theorem 4,
the attack has to spend at
least 1576 hours to secretly
identify a monitor. Apparently, such an attack is too long
to be carried out in practice. Hence, hybrid detection is
effective against spatial attacks.

VI. Performance Evaluation
In this section, we present numerical and simulation
results to evaluate the effectiveness of the localization at(cid:173)
tacking strategies and detection countermeasures discussed
in the previous sections. In particular, we evaluate the
minimum time length l required for localization attacks
in two cases: (i) the theoretical bounds derived in Sections
IV and V, and (ii) the time length for the PN-code based
