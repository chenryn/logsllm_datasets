Testing #6099
When installing an extension with `code-alpha --install-extension` I need to
pass the id that includes publisher and name.  
It's not easy to find that id out. Especially the publisher part is not
mentioned on the marketplace page itself:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python  
It is in the URL of that page though.
It would be good if it where as easy as described here
