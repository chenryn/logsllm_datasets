When developing Python applications, it is beneficial to create a robust core program that can be extended through plugins. Although I am still in the process of learning how to implement such a system, I plan to compile a list of useful references to assist me in this endeavor.

- **Beets Plugin System**: The plugin system used by [Beets](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/plugins.html) is particularly impressive and serves as an excellent example.

By exploring these resources, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively design and implement a plugin system in Python.
