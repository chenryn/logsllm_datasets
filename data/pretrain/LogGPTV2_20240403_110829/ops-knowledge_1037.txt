User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why is there a Cap on Password length? Why when we sign up on sites like Facebook and Gmail do our passwords have to be 8-12 characters in length, or some other cap? 8-12 spaces are finite, but you can make your passwords more "secure" by adding uppercase letters and numbers. 

It looks like Gmail passwords cap out at 100 characters (as of Sept 14 2017): 


I think that the real reason our passwords are capped in length is for matters of legality, above any shortcomings in cryptographic efficiency. If the company needs to access your account they will access your account and don't want any obstacles in doing so. At first I thought they put a cap on passwords because if they  store passwords with longer lengths on their servers they will run out of space on their drives, but char values like passwords doesn't occupy much space, it is just a bunch of letters and numbers after all. Perhaps PBKDF2 with HMAC can decipher passwords of any length, but it will increase CPU processing time in doing so as well as space on a drive (perhaps around 1GB for a very long password). 

Should companies with very large data centres be able to accommodate the simultaneous hashing of all the users of their platforms? 

Passwords are capped at 12 (or whatever that number may be, 100 for Gmail because Google has the money to accommodate hashing to 100 characters with ease on their systems) because password key derivation function techniques are currently not at a level to decipher passwords of longer lengths efficiently. This means if you wanted to make your password 250 characters long you wouldn't be allowed to because the company doesn't feel it would be equipped to crack your password should they ever have the need to in an efficient manner. 

Are we truly free?
what motivation do we have to make our passwords more secure than "password" or "12345678" if there is a cap imposed on our security? It seems the message they are delivering is that you can be secure, but not so secure that it makes our job more difficult. 

A lock will keep out most intruders, but the ones equipped to crack the lock will do so. Do we choose the lock that will keep the most intruders out, or buy any average lock and hope the ones that can crack it don't come by our houses? 

By making our passwords more secure through the addition of uppercase letters and numbers we begin to limit the number of people who can crack the password but people will still crack the password if they want to.

Assistant: If you don't mind me being blunt, I think you have a lot of misunderstandings in your post, and a lot of your conclusions seemed to be based on assumptions of what amount to conspiracy theories.  First, let's be clear about a couple things, which I feel should be sufficient to dispel some of your assumptions and conspiracy theories:


Google does not have the computer resources to crack a 100 character password.  The entire earth does not have enough computing power or energy to do such a thing.  In fact, even a truly random password with only ~20 characters is long enough to be uncrackable by anyone (presuming a simple brute force attack of course, and ignoring phishing/algorithm weaknesses/etc)
If google wanted access to your data they wouldn't have to try to crack your password anyway.  They could just update their source code to store the plain text version of it the next time you login.  The same is true for any website that you log in to.  Anyone running a server doesn't have to crack your password to read it: it is waaaaay easier than that.


As a result, your general statement that companies have password length maximums because that allows them to crack your password when they want to is, without exception, completely wrong.

So why are there maximums?  This question discusses that for many legacy systems:

What technical reasons are there to have low maximum password lengths?

Google is a separate matter: a 100 character maximum is not actually unreasonable.  I doubt anyone is trying to use 100 character passwords, and even password managers don't (because 100 characters is absolute overkill).  There may be technical reasons with their cryptographic algorithms that require a maximum of 100 characters, but more than likely it is an arbitrary limit put in place because some limit is needed, and there is no practical reason for having a password that long in the first place.

To reiterate one more point, there is a physical limit to the length of a password that can actually be brute-forced.  It comes down to energy considerations, and the minimum amount of energy required to run computers that could crack passwords.  The overall gist of it is that for long enough passwords, there isn't enough energy in the entire world to crack the password, even if you had infinite computing resources to throw at the problem:
