User: I'm trying to monitor log files that some process are running on linux(to create a joint log file where log entries are grouped together by when they happen). Currently I'm thinking of opening the files being logged, polling with inotify(or wrapper) and then checking if I can read any more of the file. 
Is there any better way to do this? Perhaps some library which abstracts the reading/changes in the files watched?
Assistant: Why won't a "tail -f" be sufficient? You could use popen and pipes to handle this from Python.
