distance between the lens and the object do, the distance
between the lens and the image capture plane di and the
diameter of the lens a; the roughness characteristics and the
conﬁguration of microscopic structures in the object. There-
fore, in order to obtain repeatable texture speckle patterns
generated from partially coherent light, the properties of
imaging system (di,do,a) have to be ﬁxed, across trials. The
two types of imaging systems of microscope assemblies that
we use (Digital Blue QX5TMand PC Gears AM2011TM), can
be conﬁgured such that its properties can be ﬁxed across tri-
als.
While we observe a texture speckle pattern, repeatedly ex-
tracting the pattern is not straightforward, as it is diﬃcult
Figure 1: The light source is in the same plane as the observation
point. The structure is the three dimensional cross section of the
paper and the dark edges are light rays that undergo multiple
scattering. The rays exiting the paper have a diﬀerent optical
path length that give rise to bright and dark regions representing

tical path lengths; therefore the rays interfere and result in
speckles.
The concept of speckles have been widely used in the ﬁeld
of laser speckles where a random speckle pattern is created
when a coherent laser beam is reﬂected of a rough surface.
Laser speckles have been used in research literature to ﬁn-
gerprint a wide range of objects including ﬁnger, paper doc-
uments, plastic cards, product packages [3]; the randomness
in the laser speckle pattern can be used to uniquely identify
the object. Using diﬀuse scattering of a focused laser, the
ﬁne structure of diﬀerent surfaces can be extracted. How-
ever, the speckle pattern is very much dependent on the an-
gle of measurement; hence laser speckle extraction requires
expensive machinery to align laser as well as carefully ex-
tract the object surface pattern.
2.2 Paper Speckles
While laser speckles make a good candidate for extract-
ing speckle patterns from paper, the underlying machinery
is very expensive, delicate and fairly impractical in rural, de-
veloping country settings. Similarly, the extraction of speck-
les from partially coherent light source require expensive
machinery, delicate experimental setup and careful modi-
ﬁcation of light source (to achieve either temporal or spatial
coherence) [13, 23, 14]. Instead, we show that in practice
we do not need to depend on lasers or speciﬁc partial coher-
ent light sources and can capture light scattered from mi-
croscopic non-uniformities of an object illuminated by any
partially coherent light source (such as LED) to identify and
ﬁngerprint the object. We call this type of patterns as tex-
ture speckle patterns. They are essentially, scattered light
captured from the complex underlying microscopic structure
of an object.
Consider the setup in Figure 1; using a simple microscope
(with a 10-200X zoom) with an inbuilt LED source, we can
extract a texture speckle pattern when we focus the micro-
scope on a speciﬁc portion of the paper. Here, the texture

measurements. This is primarily due to the scale at which
texture speckle is observed. To address this problem, we
use a pen to stain a small region with an arbitrary contour;
thereby producing an arbitrary contour shaded region which
is about 0.5mm in diameter. Figure 2(a)-(d), illustrates dif-
ferent texture speckle pattern pictures extracted using this
technique.
Using arbitrary contour shaded regions is important for
several reasons. First, having a small shaded region aids
in focusing within the same region for repetitive attempts
since the goal would be to have the entire region appear
within the microscope’s ﬁeld of view. Second, the arbitrary
contour helps in orienting the images in a speciﬁc direction,
as it helps in texture speckle image comparison.
Without the stain, texture speckles can be compared and
matched, but the registration process (image registration)
has to be standardized. The microscope and the paper need
to be arranged in a speciﬁc way and this arrangement should
provide the same texture speckle pattern from the same re-
gion of the paper on repeated measurements. Essentially,
the extraction of the texture speckle pattern from the same
region of the paper should be repeatable. If such a type of
system is conceived, then the ink stain need not be used.
In this paper, we have used the ink stain, as we have
performed experiments on a large scale to evaluate Paper-
Speckle (on over 1500 pieces of paper), and not conformed
to any sort of standardization. (In the rest of the paper,
when we refer to speckles, we mean texture speckles).
3. FINGERPRINT GENERATION
To generate a ﬁngerprint for a speckle pattern and to sat-
isfy the properties that are required of the ﬁngerprint we
employ a technique that is used in texture analysis called
Gabor transform and then use Singular Value Decomposi-
tion (SVD) to obtain eigenvalues (or singular values) of the
Gabor transformed speckle. The details of the algorithm and
the rationale are described below. First, we discuss Gabor
transform and explain how Gabor bit sequences can be dis-
tinguished from each other. Second, we discuss the method
of ﬁngerprint generation from Gabor bit sequences.
3.1 Gabor transform
We convert the speckle image into a bit representation by
applying Gabor transform to a speckle image. There are
three reasons for using Gabor transforms:
1. It is used in laser speckle evaluation [22], iris recogni-
tion [6], as it is used to show statistical independence
of speckles: empirically show that any two speckles are
never the same.
2. Due to the statistical independence property obtained
by using Gabor transform, it is a simple method to
obtain a compact bit representation of a speckle image
and distinguish any two bit patterns using the Ham-
ming distance.
3. Gabor transform applied to speckles is robust to global
changes in illumination and minor modiﬁcations of the
speckle image [20].
Using the above technique, pairs of speckle patterns can
be compared to ﬁnd similarity (or dissimilarity). To com-
pare two speckle patterns, we ﬁrst convert each speckle im-
age into bits using 2D Gabor transforms. Next, we compare
the two speckle bits using the Fractional Hamming distance
(FHD) metric to check if the speckles are similar or dissim-
ilar. Comparing speckles using FHD shows the statistical
independence property of Gabor transformed bit patterns.
i) Gabor transforms: We apply Gabor transforms [5] to
speckle images and extract bits using the imaginary part of
the complex phase of the Gabor wavelets,
g(x0, y0, f, θ) = e
−[π(a2(x−x0)2+b2(y−y0)2)]e[i2πf (xcosθ+ysinθ)]
The ﬁrst term is a 2D Gaussian function located at (x0, y0)
where a is width along the x-axis and b along the y-axis.
The second term is a complex 2D sinusoid of frequency f
and an orientation deﬁned by θ. These parameters can be
varied and Gabor transforms (or ﬁlters) can be applied to
any location, scale or orientation of an image. The procedure
to extract bits from the Gabor transforms can be stated as
follows:
1. Compute the imaginary part of the complex phase of
the Gabor transform for one orientation and one level.
2. Use the complex phase and apply zero as threshold to
extract a binary sequence or a binary image.
3. Repeat this procedure for various orientations (θ) and
levels (f ).
The importance of using only the complex phase of the
Gabor wavelet to extract bits is that, we eliminate any il-
lumination eﬀects, contrast or poor focus, present in the
speckle image. Due to this, the extraction of speckle images
need not be too precise. Also, mask bits are computed to re-
move the extraneous eﬀects surrounding the speckle image.
Mask bits are computed by thresholding the pixel values
to 1 beyond the boundary of the speckle and 0 inside the
speckle. If the speckle covers the entire image, then mask
bits are not needed. Since, the region where the speckle
pattern is extracted is known (marker, ink stain etc), any
region outside of that is unnecessary. This unnecessary re-
gion is considered as the mask bits. These mask bits help
in applying Gabor transforms to only the region within the
image where speckles are present.
ii) Fractional Hamming Distance (FHD): Let A and B be
the sequence of bits extracted from after applying Gabor
transforms to two speckle images; maskA and maskB be
the two mask bits of the respective speckle images. The
similarity between two sequence of bits A and B can be
computed using the Fractional Hamming Distance:
||(A ⊗ B) ∩ maskA ∩ maskB||
F HD =
||maskA ∩ maskB||
A⊗ B gives the diﬀerence between bits and the ∩ with mask
bits prevents any extraneous (unnecessary) bits to be con-
sidered in computing FHD (|| || is the norm of the vector).
The FHD provides a ratio, that deﬁnes whether the sequence
of bits are either similar or dissimilar. Ideally a FHD of 0
would represent equal bits and therefore, a perfect match of
the speckles images and a FHD of 0.5 would represent dis-
similar bits (and therefore diﬀerent speckle images), where
the likelihood of 0 or 1 occurring in a bit sequence is equally
probable.
Figure 3 shows the Gabor kernel convolved with a speckle
image under various orientations (6 orientations, θ = 0, 60o,
120o, 180o, 240o, 300o) and levels (5 levels, where f is the
scaling factor between successive levels) and the complex
phase is thresholded to zero to extract the bit sequence.
Level 4 and level 5 provide the required FHD, to statisti-
102speckle image is of size 512 × 384 pixels. The Gabor trans-
form of each speckle image provides a Gabor bit sequence of
196608 bits. Figure 5 shows the FHD values of comparing
200 pairs of “same” Gabor bit sequences with mean 0.1675
and standard deviation 0.0594. Here, “same” means Ga-
bor bit sequences in each pair correspond to speckle images
taken from the same region of the paper. The maximum
FHD value is 0.28.
The two distributions are well separated and as seen from
the ﬁgures any FHD value between 0.28 and 0.47 would dis-
tinguish two speckles and provide no false positive/negatives.
How well are the two distributions separated? It would take
the modiﬁcation of at least 39321 bits for the two distribu-
tions to intersect each other, which around 20% of the total
number of bits in the Gabor sequence. For the mean (peak)
of two distributions to meet, around 32% (62914 bits) of
the total number of bits in the Gabor sequence has to be
modiﬁed.
We process 200 speckle images from four diﬀerent kinds of
paper and we examine each pixel value (intensity) of these
speckle images. The mean of each pixel (across 200 speckle
images) is computed and the mean value is plotted. The
entropy of the Gabor bit sequence is maximized if each pixel
value is 0.5 (the probability of each pixel being either 0 or
1). Figure 6 shows the probability of a bit being set in a
Gabor bit sequence of a paper speckle is almost 0.5, which
suggests that the entropy of Gabor bit sequence is high.

ent speckle image bits with mean = 0.48705 and standard devia-
tion = 0.00577.
3.2 Fingerprint
Once we have the Gabor bit sequence for a speckle image,
we convert the bit sequence into a binary matrix SG such
that its dimensions match the dimensions of the speckle im-
age. Let SG be the Gabor binary matrix. We apply SVD to
SG to obtain singular values, which we use as the ﬁngerprint
of the region of paper.
In SVD, we decompose SG as, SG = U ΣV T where or-
thogonal matrices U and V contain left and right singular
vectors of SG, respectively, and the diagonal of Σ contains
the singular values of SG. The singular values of any arbi-
trary matrix are uniquely determined [26]. These singular
values are the square root of eigenvalues of SGST
G.
Gabor binary matrix SG is a binary (0,1) matrix and
G is a real valued symmetric matrix. Therefore, the

cally distinguish two speckles. Table 1, shows the variation
of FHD for various levels, for same speckle pattern extracted
at diﬀerent periods of time. (We have chosen orientation 5,
which corresponds to θ = 2400 at each level, since the FHD
values are similar for diﬀerent orientations at a level). The
FHD values at level 4 and level 5 are close to 0, which shows
that these are the same speckle patterns. Table 2, shows
the variation of FHD, when a candidate speckle is compared
with diﬀerent speckle patterns. The FHD values at level 4
and level 5 are close to 0.5, which show that these are diﬀer-
ent speckle patterns. We have found relatively similar FHD
values (as described in Tables 1, 2) when trying to distin-
guish speckles in all of our experiments. In this paper, for
statistical evaluation, we have chosen level 5 and orientation
5 as the Gabor bit sequence to compare speckle patterns us-
ing FHD. We have found similar statistical results for Gabor
bit sequences extracted from diﬀerent orientations of level 4
and level 5.
