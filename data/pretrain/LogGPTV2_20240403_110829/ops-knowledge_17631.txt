User: Please describe the advantages and disadvantages of multi-node databases.
Assistant: Advantages of multi-node databases: 1. High availability: Multi-node databases use the characteristics of distributed systems to keep the system online when any node fails. 2. Scalability: When system requirements increase, nodes can be easily added to solve performance problems. 3. Reliability: Distributed data is stored on multiple nodes. If a single node crashes or has a storage failure, the data can still be recovered from other nodes. 4. Distributed: Data is stored on multiple nodes, which can avoid single point of failure and network congestion. 5. Better performance: The tasks of a multi-node database can be distributed among multiple nodes, thus enhancing the data processing capability. Disadvantages of multi-node databases: 1. Communication between nodes takes time and bandwidth, which can lead to delays and network congestion. 2. Maintaining multi-node databases requires more manpower and material resources. 3. When data is distributed on multiple nodes, it may cause data inconsistency and require additional processing. 4. Multi-node databases require more O&M and management delivery costs.
