APPENDIX F
Figure 20 shows the classiﬁcation results in the form of
heat-map-represented confusion matrices corresponding to the
nearby scenario evaluation performed in Section VI-C, and
Figure 21 shows the confusion matrices corresponding to the
evaluation in the ﬁrst faraway scenario.
APPENDIX G
We relax the limitations in the nearby scenario setting by
allowing the training data set to include examples collected
at all the other seven spots when testing each of the last four
spots (i.e., spots N5, N6, N7, and N8). Table IX shows the
evaluation results. Compared with the results in Table V, we
can observe that the accuracy is increased by more than 10% in

APPENDIX H
A counterintuitive phenomenon in the website ﬁngerprinting
evaluation is that the accuracy for the NVIDIA GTX 1650 is
higher at far distances than it is at near distances. One possible
reason for this phenomenon is that some other EM signal in
the frequency range of our interest is generated from a certain
hardware component on the MSI GTX 1650 GPU card, which
does not propagate far but is still relatively strong at 1 m. In
other words, this additional signal is more disturbing to the
EM signal of interest at 1 m. To simply verify this, we show
two normalized S[k] traces in Figure 22 derived from signals
captured at 1 m and 3 m, corresponding to a 2Hz performance
level switching. From the ﬁgure, we can see that the S[k] trace
at 1 m indeed has many relatively high spikes in between two
expected spikes. However, due to the high complexity of the
hardware stack of NVIDIA GPUs, we cannot easily pinpoint
the exact component that contributes to this.

is increased by 11.1%, and in terms of NVIDIA RTX 3060,
the accuracy is increased by 11.6% in the Linux case and
13.3% in the Windows case). Similarly, Table X shows the
evaluation results when we relax the limitations in the ﬁrst
faraway scenario. Since an attacker can freely choose different
spots for proﬁling at his/her own place, the accuracies reported
