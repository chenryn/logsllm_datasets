### Appendix F: Classification Results
Figure 20 presents the classification results in the form of heat-map-represented confusion matrices corresponding to the nearby scenario evaluation performed in Section VI-C. Figure 21 shows the confusion matrices corresponding to the first faraway scenario evaluation.

### Appendix G: Relaxed Nearby Scenario Evaluation
In this section, we relax the limitations in the nearby scenario setting by allowing the training dataset to include examples collected at all other seven spots when testing each of the last four spots (i.e., spots N5, N6, N7, and N8). Table IX summarizes the evaluation results. Compared with the results in Table V, we observe that the accuracy is increased by more than 10% in many cases. For example, the accuracy for NVIDIA GTX 1080 increased by 11.1%, and for NVIDIA RTX 3060, it increased by 11.6% in the Linux case and 13.3% in the Windows case.

**Table IX: Fingerprinting Accuracy in the Relaxed Nearby Scenario (Training Examples Collected at All Other Spots)**
| GPU Model | Avg. Accuracy | Std. Deviation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| RX 580    | 93.0%         | 1.4%           |
| RX 5600   | 86.9%         | 0.7%           |
| RX 5700   | 80.6%         | 1.6%           |
| GTX 1080  | 90.1%         | 3.1%           |
| GTX 1650  | 89.9%         | 1.9%           |
| RTX 30601 | 82.7%         | 3.9%           |
| RTX 30602 | 77.2%         | 4.1%           |

Similarly, Table X shows the evaluation results when we relax the limitations in the first faraway scenario. Since an attacker can freely choose different spots for profiling, the accuracies reported here represent more pragmatic results.

**Table X: Fingerprinting Accuracy in the Relaxed Faraway Scenario (Training Examples Collected at All Other Spots)**
| GPU Model | Avg. Accuracy | Std. Deviation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| RX 580    | 83.4%         | 2.7%           |
| GTX 1650  | 95.7%         | 1.1%           |

### Appendix H: Counterintuitive Phenomenon in Website Fingerprinting
A counterintuitive phenomenon observed in the website fingerprinting evaluation is that the accuracy for the NVIDIA GTX 1650 is higher at far distances than at near distances. One possible reason for this phenomenon is the presence of additional EM signals generated from a certain hardware component on the MSI GTX 1650 GPU card. These signals do not propagate far but are still relatively strong at 1 meter, making them more disturbing to the EM signal of interest at that distance.

To verify this, we show two normalized S[k] traces in Figure 22 derived from signals captured at 1 meter and 3 meters, corresponding to a 2Hz performance level switching. From the figure, we can see that the S[k] trace at 1 meter indeed has many relatively high spikes between the expected spikes. However, due to the high complexity of the hardware stack of NVIDIA GPUs, pinpointing the exact component responsible for this is challenging.
