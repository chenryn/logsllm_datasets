Subject: Assistance Needed with Pkg.init() and Pkg.add() Behind Corporate Proxy

Dear Team,

I am encountering difficulties while using the `Pkg.init()` and `Pkg.add()` functions behind a corporate proxy. Below are the details of the issue:

julia> Pkg.init()

I have also attempted to manually clone the `METADATA.jl` repository, which was successful:

```plaintext

Cloning into 'METADATA.jl'...

```

To resolve this issue, I have tried the following steps:
- Configured global Git proxy settings using `git config --global https.proxy <proxy-url>`.
- Set the `url."git://".insteadOf https://` configuration to use `git` instead of `https`.
- Configured environment variables in the shell, such as `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`.
- Attempted to initialize the package repository with the full URL, replacing `https` with `git` or `http`.

Despite these efforts, I am still unable to get `Pkg.init()` and `Pkg.add()` to work behind our corporate proxy. I do not see any obvious reasons why this should not be working.

Could you please provide some guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Morgan
