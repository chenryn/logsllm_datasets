 **Describe the bug**
Our team has used Three.JS to create a Virtual Tour content type that allows
content authors to create interactions which enables the user to navigate
around a scene, click on interactions and change to different scenes.
We've recently updated our this content type to work with labels which are 2d
objects. However after testing in Safari we started to notice that lines would
be drawn all over the scene from our labels. These lines go away when you
hover over a label again however they keep on coming back and look quite
distracting for a user.
**Potential fix**
I found that by using whole numbers, rather than decimal numbers, for the
pixel position of the buttons (which the labels that cause the issue are a
child of). This would be done by adding `Math.round` twice on this line. I've
made the change on our fork of the Three.JS library and it has has issue has
been gone since.
I was wondering if anyone had noticed any issue like this and if this fix is
valid? Or if it's instead caused by another change we made somewhere.
