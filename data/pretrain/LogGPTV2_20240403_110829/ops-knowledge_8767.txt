User: I have a example.py file. loaded on a linux server. I put some prints in this file and saved it. 
When I call this .py file I am not getting these changes.
Do I need to do something (Like for C we need to compile the .c file and put the .so to LD_LIBRARY_PATH) for python also.
Thanks,

Many linux servers including Apache and Nginx load the files they need to serve when they start for performance sake. So, you may need to restart the server to pickup the latest python file.
