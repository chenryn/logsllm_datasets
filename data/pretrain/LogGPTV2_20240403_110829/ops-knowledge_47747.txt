User: I have to run some student-made code that they made as homework, I'm running this on my own computer (Mac OS), and I'm not entirely certain they won't accidentally "rm -rf /" my machine. Is there an easy way to run their python scripts with reduced permissions, so that e.g. they can access only a certain directory? Is PyPy the way to go?
Assistant: Create a new user account "student". Run your students' scripts as "student". Worst case, the script will destroy this special user account. If this happens, just delete user "student" and start over.
