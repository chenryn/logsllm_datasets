### Analysis of Specific Servers
- **usnyc3-ntp-003.aaplimg.com**:
  - This server, which is also an R server, only drops from Stratum-1 to Stratum-0 0.0018% of the time. This is 29 times less frequent than its error time at 0.052%. Therefore, for this server, clock errors are a more significant concern than stratum stability.

### Best-50 Servers
- The Best-50 servers are marked with specific symbols in Figure 3, highlighting several key observations:
  - 9 out of the 50 Constant S1 servers have clock errors.
  - Only 2 servers in the Best-50 take 3 or more stratum values.
  - Servers with Ideal Leap Performance and zero S1Downtime generally have a Server Error rating of G, indicating that these criteria can be predictive of well-managed servers. However, this is not foolproof, as exceptions exist, such as ptbtime3.ptb.de and two NIST servers in Table 5.

### Apple's Domain
- The server list includes 35 servers from Apple’s 17.253 domain, with three making it into the Best-50. All of these exhibit server errors with relatively large error times.
- Despite having 66 servers from National Laboratories, only 12 (colored cyan) make it into the Best-50. Additionally, five from the NMI in Australia are excluded as they are not publicly accessible.

### Criteria for Best-50
- The criteria for entry into the Best-50 are strict, ensuring that these servers are very well-behaved. Relaxing the criteria in different dimensions reveals a wider variety of behaviors. Table 5 provides contrasting examples, with bolded entries marking the criteria that did not meet the Best-50 standard.

### Discussion
- **Source Coverage**: The server list is expected to contain most widely used public S-1 servers due to the high profile of the Org list and the widespread usage of the Pool service. There is a high degree of overlap between the main sources: Org, Pool, and LBL. Using the Chapman estimator, the estimated population of public-facing Stratum-1 servers is 522, with a 95% coverage interval of [497, 562].
- **List Shelf Life**: The utility of the Best-50 list will decrease over time. Longitudinal studies suggest that the churn in the Best-50 list will be low on useful timescales, such as 5 years.
- **Measurement Cost**: The analysis requires specialist hardware, techniques, and significant effort. Future work should focus on developing lighter-weight approximate techniques and more automated server error detection using standard hardware.
- **Server Ranking**: Various rankings could be defined, such as S1Downtime ordering or Badtime (sum of Errtime and 1-Availability). Great care must be taken to prevent high-ranking servers from receiving high loads.
- **Client Impacts**: The impact on clients depends on various factors, including the robustness of the clock synchronization algorithm, backup policies, and the characteristics of the path to the server. The onus is on Stratum-1 servers to show near-perfect behavior to anchor and lift performance across the timing system.

### Conclusion
- The Best-50 list is not definitive but represents a serious attempt to quantify best practices for timeservers. It is expected to be useful for several years, with potential improvements in methodology to make the list more comprehensive, dynamic, and less expensive to generate.
