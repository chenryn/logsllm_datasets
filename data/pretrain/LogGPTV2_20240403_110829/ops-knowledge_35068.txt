User: I have a Python daemon running on a Linux system.
I would like to feed information such as "Bob", "Alice", etc. and have the daemon print "Hello Bob." and "Hello Alice" to a file.
This has to be asynchronous. The Python daemon has to wait for information and print it whenever it receives something.
What would be the best way to achieve this?
I was thinking about a named pipe or the Queue library but there could be better solutions.
Assistant: Why not use signals?
I am not a python programmer but presumably you can register a signal handler within your daemon and then signal it from the terminal. Just use SIGUSR or SIGHUP or similar.
This is the usual method you use to rotate logfiles or similar.
