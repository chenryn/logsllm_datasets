Snort and IDS-C are the only intrusion-detection probes sending alerts that
are obvious false alerts (note that the others do generate false alerts as well on
190
H. Debar and B. Morin
other traﬃc proﬁles, but extensive testing for false alerts was beyond the purpose
of the tests). For Snort, this is due to the overly simplistic signature database
that matches on strings found in the long URL evasion mode (7 and 15). For
IDS-C, the same long URL mode matches on pornographic signatures. IDS-C
also matches ‘‘perl’’ on the ‘‘perlshop.cgi’’ scan event; this is considered
a false alert because it matches on part of the ﬁle name only and should be
corrected.
The classiﬁcation of alerts in category G, A or B is not inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly
by the type of evasive encoding used (except for IDS-B). The total count drops
a bit or stays steady, and only the E column increases. This means that ﬁltering
the evasive alerts would make the diagnostic acceptable for an operator, without
loosing too much accuracy.
As a comparison between IDS-B and the other probes, only evasion modes 1
to 3 can be used (due to the HEAD phenomenon mentioned earlier). This shows
that both IDS-B and IDS-A are almost equivalent in terms of performance.
IDS-C has a slightly better score, with the cost of additional false alerts.
Although the ‘‘perl’’ signature from IDS-C is overly large, other signa-
tures of the same probe are very precise and distinguish between locations. For
example, it matches on /mlog.phtml, but not /cgi-bin/mlog.html, whereas
Snort matches on both. This indicates that the signatures from IDS-C can
probably be enhanced to better take into account the attack conditions, which
is an important possibility to reduce the number of false positives.
4.5 Results of the Live cgi Attacks
The results of these tests are presented in Table 4. Note that when an attack
is not caught through generation of one or several alerts, an actual compromise
of our victim web server is not diagnosed and reported. Therefore, missed at-
tacks are counted as a very bad point, especially since the attacks were carried
out using parameters that are known to be embedded in signatures, such as
/etc/passwd.
Our test includes 18 attacks. IDS-A and Snort are the two best probes on
this test, generating at least one alert for 15 of the 18 attempts. This could look
like a very nice result, but is actually not so. In cases where the tools give us
only one alert they only catch the presence of the /etc/passwd string on the
request; they do not identify the vulnerability itself. Quite clearly, the fact that
a request targets the password ﬁle is important and must be ﬂagged, even if the
vulnerable CGI script is not known to the intrusion-detection system. However,
the fact that only the password ﬁle is known as an anomalous symptom shows
that the designers of intrusion-detection systems have little imagination in terms
of attackers targets.
Also, this ranking changes when analysing the accuracy of the diagnostic
proposed by the intrusion-detection system. IDS-C and IDS-D do a much better
job of highlighting the extend of an attack. They both diagnose multiple aspects
of the attack, such as the name of the vulnerable script used as the attack vector,
directory traversal activity, request for /etc/passwd and indicate whether the
