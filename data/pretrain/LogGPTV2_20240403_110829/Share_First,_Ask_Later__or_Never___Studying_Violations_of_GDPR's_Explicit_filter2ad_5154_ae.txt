### Industry Leading Ad Networks and GDPR Compliance

Leading ad networks, such as Facebook and Admob, only accept applications that are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, GDPR compliance is a prerequisite for app approval by these advertising platforms. It is crucial to ensure that our app meets these standards.

### Developer Awareness and SDK Data Collection

Some developers reported being aware of GDPR-relevant data but were surprised to learn from our reports that Software Development Kits (SDKs) were collecting information without their explicit instruction. For example, one developer stated, "We were already aware of this topic and were working on it. We did not send any events to Facebook (we eliminated this feature long ago), but the SDK itself sent data to Facebook without any trigger from our side." 

While this lack of knowledge does not absolve the primary party of their responsibilities, the absence of clear guidelines and safe defaults for GDPR-compliant data collection in the advertising industry inevitably puts app developers at risk of severe fines for GDPR violations.

### Recommendations for Advertisers and Third Parties

Our findings highlight the urgent need for advertisement companies and third parties (data controllers) to make comprehensive changes to help app developers comply with European regulations and uphold the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. Specifically, third parties should:

1. **Limit Data Collection**: Respect the principles of data protection by design and by default.
2. **Obtain User Consent**: Provide a consent mechanism that automatically displays a consent dialogue to users, explicitly asking for opt-in to data sharing and collection, without forcing developers to implement this in a legally compliant way.
3. **Transparent Documentation**: Make documentation transparent and easily accessible, including explicit discussions of the implications of GDPR violations.

### Actions for App Stores

App stores, such as Google Play, play a critical role in distributing developers' apps to users and supporting them in adhering to regional regulations. However, we found that developers often lack the necessary support. For instance, one developer noted, "This game was designed for Brazil, and we published it in Europe in March 2019 to expand our potential customer base, targeting Portugal. Google Play allows this by checking a button, without any restrictions. So, I feel protected by Google somehow."

Therefore, we strongly recommend that app stores take more decisive actions, such as informing developers about the associated regulations of the selected countries when they upload their apps. Additionally, app stores could employ techniques like ours to identify potential GDPR violations or the use of outdated SDKs, and then notify developers before delivering the apps to end-users.

### Support for Developers

Developers play a major role in ensuring their apps comply with the GDPR. Our findings indicate that they are currently at a disadvantage. More than half of the responses we received indicated that developers were unaware of what constitutes personal data under GDPR. There is a clear need for better information, documentation, and tools to help developers avoid such pitfalls.

Furthermore, our in-depth analysis of third-party developer and legal documentation revealed that third parties often make it difficult for developers to comply with GDPR. We call on third-party vendors to provide better documentation and transparency in legal documents, which developers should thoroughly review when building their apps.

### Conclusion

In this study, we analyzed 86,163 Android apps to understand the current state of GDPR's explicit consent violations. We found that 24,838 (34.3% of the successfully analyzed) apps sent personal data to advertisement providers acting as data controllers without the user's explicit prior consent. Our results shed new light on the widespread nature of this issue, which is often misunderstood among developers and requires a concerted effort from ad providers, app stores, and developers to mitigate. We have derived concrete recommendations for all concerned parties and make an urgent call to help developers comply with the GDPR and honor users' rights and freedoms.
