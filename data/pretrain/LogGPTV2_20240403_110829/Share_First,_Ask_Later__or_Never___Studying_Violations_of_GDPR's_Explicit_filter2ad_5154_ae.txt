industry leading ad networks that only accept those apps that
are GDPR compliant. So a GDPR compliance is must before
the app is being approved by these advertising networks (i.e.
Facebook & Admob). So our app is a GDPR complaint” (sic).
In addition, some respondents claimed to be aware of GDPR-
relevant data, but were surprised by our reports which showed
that the SDKs collected information; “We were already aware
of this topic and we were already working on it. We did not
send any events to Facebook (we eliminated this feature long
ago) – the SDK itself sent out data to Facebook without any
trigger from our side”. While this lack of knowledge does
not absolve the ﬁrst party of their responsibility, the lack of
clear guidelines and safe defaults for GDPR-compliant data
collection by the advertisement industry inevitably puts their
customers, i.e., the app developers, at risk of the draconian
ﬁnes which can be imposed for GDPR violations [29].
Our ﬁndings show the urgent need for advertisement com-
panies and third parties (data controllers) to make comprehen-
sive changes to help app developers comply with European
regulations and exercise the data subjects’ fundamental rights
and freedoms. Particularly, third parties ﬁrst should limit the
data collection to respect principles of data protection by
design and by default. For obtaining user consent, third par-
ties should provide the consent mechanism that automatically
shows the consent dialogue to users and explicitly ask for
opt-in to data sharing and collection, without forcing the de-
velopers to implement this mechanism in a legally compliant
way. Further, to support developers, third parties should make
their documentation transparent and easy to access, including
explicit discussions of implications of violating GDPR.
6.2 App Stores Should Take Actions
App stores such as Google Play are a channel for the distribu-
tion of developers’ apps to the users, which play an important
role in supporting developers to be informed about each terri-
tory’s related regulations and protect user privacy. However,
we found that developers lack such support, e.g., “This game
was designed to Brazil and we published the game to Europe
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    3679
in March 2019 to expand our potencial [sic] customers, tar-
geting Portugal. GooglePlay allows this, checking a button,
without any restrictions. So, I feel protected by Google some-
how”. Therefore, we strongly suggest that app stores should
take more decisive actions in this area. For example, when
developers upload their apps, the store should tell them about
the selected countries’ associate regulations.
Besides a large number of apps that sent PD to ad-related
domains without users’ explicit consent (24,838 apps), we
further detected a total of 3,840 apps that combined the AAID
with some other type of PD. Hence, all these apps not only
infringe on the explicit consent required by GDPR, but also
violate Google’s policy [3, 50]. Such behaviors happened due
to developers’ opt-in or the usage of outdated libraries that do
not support GDPR. Given that, app stores could also employ
such techniques as our to identify the potential violations of
GDPR explicit consent, or the usage of outdated SDK by or
LibScout [9], and then inform developers before delivering
the apps to end-users. To support this effort, we make our
analysis pipeline available as open-source [1].
6.3 Support for Developers
Obviously developers play a major role in making their apps
compliant with the GDPR. Our ﬁndings show that they are
currently put in a disadvantaged position. Out of the responses
we received, more than half noted that they were unaware of
what counts as personal data under GDPR. From the received
responses, there is a clear need for better information and
documentation as well as tools which help developers avoid
such pitfalls. Further, based on our in-depth analysis of third
party’s developer and legal documentation, we observed that
third parties make it cumbersome for developers to comply
with GDPR. We therefore strongly call on third-party vendors
for better documentation and transparency in legal documents,
which should in turn be thoroughly checked by developers
when building their apps.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we performed an empirical study of 86,163
Android apps to understand the current state of the violation of
GDPR’s explicit consent. Doing so, we found 24,838 (34.3%
of the successfully analyzed) apps sent personal data towards
advertisement providers that act as data controllers without
the user’s explicit prior consent. We believe that our results
shed new light on the current state of the violation of GDPR’s
explicit consent in the wild. Based on our insights from our
notiﬁcations and in-depth analysis, we ﬁnd that this problem
is widespread, misunderstood among developers, and requires
effort from ad providers, app stores, and developers alike to
mitigate. Finally, we derived concrete recommendations to all
concerned parties and make an urgent call to help developers
comply with the GDPR and honor users’ rights and freedoms.
