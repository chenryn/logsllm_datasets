Hi,
I know this an already open/closed issue but I think bootstrap MUST have a
convenient way to load ajax content into modals (and popovers).
At the moment I use https://github.com/Nikku/jquery-bootstrap-scripting (even
done some minor recently merged modifications into it).
Could it be the starting point for a further and better integrated work into
bootstrap ?
A markup driven ajax content loading into modals is definitively a good user
experience and an unobtrusive way to do the work without writing pain in the
ass javascript code.
Please, let's discuss that.
