**Current Behavior:**
When attempting to analyze a component's state using React Developer Tools, the analysis pane remains in the `Loading...` state and throws the following error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
    at O (backend.js:1)
    at s (backend.js:1)
    at s (backend.js:1)
    at s (backend.js:1)
    at l (backend.js:1)

    at t. (backend.js:6)
    at t.r.emit (backend.js:6)
    at backend.js:32
    at t (backend.js:8)
```

The ability to analyze the component's state as in previous versions of React DevTools.
