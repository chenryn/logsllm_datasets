PWMs. We further found that some PWMs, especially those
build into common browsers, use JavaScript to interact with
website elements. While this is usually done to detect all
possibly relevant input ﬁelds on a page, we also found PWMs
who manipulate the website after credentials were entered or
after submitting a login. Manipulating websites in this way can
cause the website to malfunction, as it might trigger events
linked to the respective website elements and is further not
necessary to detect input ﬁelds.
for HTTP Basic Authentication (Password
Support
Managers). While basic authentication is not frequently used
anymore, we argue that as a web authentication standard it
should be supported by PWMs. Basic authentication is not part
of the website, but a mechanism provided by the respective
browser, and as such requires different detection approaches
than those used to identify input ﬁelds. However, most current
browsers provide APIs that PWMs could use to access and
therefore support basic authentication forms [6], [31].
Better Support for TOTP (Password Managers). Finally,
we found that almost none of the PWMs we investigated
supports the automatic generation and ﬁlling of TOTP. This
can be regarded as a double-edged sword: While the adoption
of a TOTP feature increases convenience and usability of a
password manager by easing the process for users, it also
removes the multiple factors as everything is stored in one
place, rendering the PWM a single point of failure. A way
to mitigate this issue is the addition of a separate smartphone
application that is necessary to use TOTP, which is already
offered by some PWMs such as Dashlane. This could further
be used to increase security by allowing the PWM to send push
notiﬁcations with authentication requests to a user’s phone,
adding a second factor without necessarily adopting a TOTP
mechanism.
VII. CONCLUSION
This work identiﬁed several shortcomings of both modern
desktop PWMs as well as current authentication implementa-
tion on websites, which lead to interaction problems between
them. While our work provides the ﬁrst systematic analysis of
interaction problems between desktop PWMs and websites,
we identiﬁed different areas for future work. Although we
collected and labelled Chrome Web Store reviews and GitHub
issues until we reached saturation, our list of interaction
problems is not exhaustive. Further work could review ad-
ditional resources such as issue trackers by browser vendors.
Furthermore, our work focuses on desktop PWMs. However,
mobile PWMs are getting more important and bring their own
opportunities and limitations. Hence, a similar analysis could
be helpful for mobile PWMs.
