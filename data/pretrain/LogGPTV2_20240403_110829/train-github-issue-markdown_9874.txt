The `ne` operator is a point-wise mathematical function, and migrating it from TH (Torch) code to ATen (and TensorIterator) should be straightforward. This migration will help in several ways: it will clean up the code, simplify the dispatch mechanism, and provide an immediate 2-3x performance improvement for the operator.

- **Porting Guide:** For detailed instructions on how to perform this migration, refer to the [TH to ATen Porting Guide](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/TH-to-ATen-porting-guide).
- **Example PR:** An example of a similar migration can be found in [PR #14714](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/14714), which ports the `adaptive_avg_pool2d` function.
- **TensorIterator Usage:** To understand how to use TensorIterator, consult the [How to Use TensorIterator](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/How-to-use-TensorIterator) guide.
