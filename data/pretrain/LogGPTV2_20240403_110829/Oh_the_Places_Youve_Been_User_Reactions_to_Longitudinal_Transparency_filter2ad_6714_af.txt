A APPENDIX
A.1 Interview Script
The purpose of this study is to inform the design of an app to help users like you learn
more about browsing the internet and online trackers. You are allowed to leave at any
time. If you still consent to being part of this study, please say, “Yes.” [wait] Are you
okay with me recording audio for our session? [wait] Today’s study has three parts.
First, I have some intro questions about your experiences with online tracking, and I’ll
also explain what the app is supposed to do. Second is the main part, where we’ll go
through each page of the app. At the end, we have a few short closing questions.
• On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least and 5 being the most, how knowl-
• On a scale of 1 to 5, how interested would you say that you are in learning
• In your own words, could you explain to me what you know about online
edgeable would you say you are about online tracking and how it works?
more online tracking? Why did you choose that number?
tracking?
Today we are testing an app called “Tracking Transparency.” It was developed by
researchers at the University of Chicago, and we were hired by these researchers to
get feedback about the app. The app is a browser extension that shows your browsing
history, which trackers you have encountered online, and what inferences they might
have made about you, based on web pages you have visited. Now, I’m going to read
a short description of online tracking that the researchers want you to know: When
you browse the internet, your online activity is tracked by the website you are visit-
ing, as well as by third-party advertising and analytics companies. These third-party
companies use logs of your browsing behavior to infer your interests, preferences,
and demographics. They can then tailor your internet experience in part based on
those inferences, impacting the search results, ads, and social feeds that you see. For
example, if you visit a blog about traveling with dogs and a third-party tracker on that
site infers that you are interested in dogs. Later, you might encounter an ad that was
targeted specifically to dog lovers.
Again, we were hired by the researchers to get feedback on their Tracking Trans-
parency browser extension. I didn’t make the app, so please feel free to give me any
and all feedback, I won’t be offended! There is not one particular design they hope
you’ll like better than the others; they’re most interested in your honest and blunt
feedback for everything you see. As you go through the app, I would like you to think-
aloud for me as you answer. You know the little voice in your head that sometimes
narrates as you answer questions or take surveys? I just want you to vocalize that
little voice out loud for me as you go through. Let’s get started. We have a copy of the
extension on this computer for you to use. As you can see, the browser extension logo
is in the upper right corner. If we click on the extension logo, the extension provides an
overview of the tracking information, and by clicking on the "Show me more..." button,
we will get to the main pages of the browser extension. You can access the individual
tabs at the top of the browser extension: trackers, inferences, domain, recent activity,
and time. Please think-aloud as you go to each of these tabs.
Researcher will direct participant to each tab and to think aloud with their perceptions.
If they are silent, researcher will use the questions listed below to guide their thinking.
• What are you thinking now?
• Why did you do that?
• What is this tab telling you?
• What do you think the graph is showing you?
• What do you think the table is showing you?
• What is confusing on this tab to you? (Change/add/remove to make clearer?)
• What do you think would happen if you clicked this link?
• Do you think the graph is interesting?
• Would you add/change/remove anything to make this tab more interesting?
• Would you go return to this tab after the first time you see it? Why?
• What is the most interesting thing on this page to you?
• Is there anything you would want to know but isn’t explained on this tab?
• Do you feel like this tab is telling you new and interesting information, com-
pared to previous tabs?
This is the last section - we just have a three last questions.
tive would you say the app was?
• On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least and 5 being the most, how informa-

this session, about how online tracking works?
And finally, do you have any questions for us? Thank you so much for your partici-
pation in today’s session. We are very grateful for all your comments today, and will
be passing them on to the researchers’ for their final design. Here is a $10 Amazon
gift card. If you have any questions about this research, you may contact our Principal
Investigator or the IRB at the contact info on the consent form. Thank you again!
