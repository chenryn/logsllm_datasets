A  brief  analysis  of  Table  1  raises  some  immediate 
considerations. The first obvious aspect is that there are 
many best practices that appear only in a subset of the 
CIS documents. This is mainly due to two reasons. The 
first one is, of course, because each document was writ-
ten by different people and because a large part of the 
documents  is  based  on  empirical  experience.  This  re-
sults  in  different  sensibilities  of  what  are  the most im-
portant  security  problems  in  each  DBMS.  The  second 
reason is related to the fact that the documents are cen-
tered  in  the  configuration  mechanisms  and  parameters 
available in each DBMS, which means that whenever a 
particular  feature  is  absent  or  not  configurable  it  ends 
up not appearing in the documents. 
We  believe  that  the  absence  of  certain  best  prac-
tices in a given document should be considered a prob-
lem,  even  if  they  represent  minor  issues  for  a  specific 
DBMS. By being completely subjective and dependent 
on the environment, DBMS security assessment should 
always  be  an  exhaustive  task,  despite  of  the  DBMS 
considered. This means that calling the attention of the 
DBA  to  a  particular  aspect  allows  him  to  anticipate

problem  in  the  DBMS  being  used.  For  example,  the 
precaution  related  to  not  storing  sensitive  information 
in  system  variables  is  mentioned  only  on  the  MySQL 
document  (e.g.,  best  practice  #45).  However,  this  can 
clearly  be  a  problem  in  any  DBMS.  Another  case  is 
when  a  specific  feature  is  not  available  in  a  given 
DBMS.  For  instance,  MySQL  does  not  have  auditing 
capabilities, but it is easy to see that they can be built, 
to  a  certain  extent,  using  other  DBMS  features  like 
triggers. The important issue here is not to “have audit-
ing turned on,” but to have ways of tracking operations 
done on the system. 
The  total  number  of  recommendations  in  each 
document (last line of the table) suggests an interesting 
fact. Although the commercial DBMS considered (Ora-
cle  and  SQLServer)  have  a  quite  similar  number  of 
recommendations,  the  open  source  one  (MySQL)  has 
significantly fewer. This is understandable as the num-
ber  of  configuration  settings  presented  in  the  CIS 
documents  is  obviously  related  to the number of func-
tionalities and configuration options available. MySQL 
is an open source DBMS that provides a reduced set of 
functionalities  when  compared 
to  more  complex 
DBMS like Oracle and SQLServer. 
3. Testing DBMS configuration security 
As mentioned before, the goal is to propose a set of 
tests to evaluate, in a systematic manner, if the security 
best  practices  drawn  from  the  analysis  of  the  CIS  rec-
ommendations  are  being  applied  in  real  DBMS  instal-
lations.  Those  tests  are  presented  in  Table  2  (the  rela-
tion between the tests and the practices is identified by 
the number in the first column of the tables 1 and 2). 
The tests were defined in such way that they have to 
be answered by an experienced DBA with deep knowl-
edge  of  the  operating  system  in  use,  and  some  knowl-
edge of computer networks. For some of the tests, spe-
cial security knowledge is required, which is defined by 
the figures of “security expert” and “experienced staff”, 
the latter also assuming enterprise knowledge. In these 
cases,  to  simplify  the  DBA  work,  we  provide  refer-
ences  to  bibliography  where  this  security  knowledge 
can  be  obtained.  We  also  use  the  terms  “reasonable” 
and “regularly” when a part of the test depends on par-
ticular  bounds  that  can  not  be  defined  without  taking 
into  account  the  client  applications  that  are  using  the 
database  (e.g.,  test  #32).  In  these  cases,  we  expect the 
DBA to either estimate these bounds or to discuss them 
with the systems analysts and other experts. 
The  tests  are  stated  in  the  second  column  of Table 
2,  and  typically  include  two  steps.  The  initial  step, 
which  is  not  defined  for  every  test,  is  a  procedure  to 
obtain  the  particular  information  necessary  to  answer 
the test. This step is also optional, in the sense that the 
DBA  might  obtain  the  knowledge  in  alternative  ways. 
The  second  step  is  a  series  of  yes/no  questions  that 
should be answered. If, for any of the listed questions, 
the answer is the one stated in the rightmost column of 
Table  2,  then  the  test  fails.  Also,  in  some  cases,  the 
DBA might not know how to answer a particular ques-
tion,  which  is  an  “unknown”  answer.  Any  unknown 
answer  must  be  treated  as  a  failed  test,  although  the 
correct  solution,  in  this  case,  is  to  find  out  potential 
ways to answer it.

Locate the table or file where the passwords are stored and ask for a security 
expert to analyze it. Are the passwords stored as some recognizably standard 
hash algorithm? [2, 11] 
Is logging turned on? Is the log level set to report at least database errors and 
client connections? Is there a clearly justified reason for it not to be set to a 
higher level? 
Are the logs periodically checked? Are the logs also included in the backup 
procedures? Is the space of the partition where the logs are written monitored?  No 
Are the following operations traceable: creation and destruction of users, 
objects and sessions; failed and successful logins; rights assignments and 
data changes on critical tables? 
Is the trace data stored in a different area from the database? Does that area 
have its read/write permissions correctly set?  Is the space of the partition 
where it is stored monitored? 
For each configuration file, analyze its permissions. Is it readable only by 
authorized users? 
For each system variable, does it contain sensitive information (any which 
should be private) and can it be seen by all OS users? 
Are core_dump or trace files being generated for failed processes and are 
they generally visible in the OS? 
Does the editor used to update configuration files generate backups of the 
edited files and do they remain available for reading afterwards?  
For each function and extended functionality available, does it allow a user to 
access a file on the file system? 
For each function and extended functionality available, does it allow a user to 
do any kind of network operation? 
For each function and extended functionality available, is its availability clearly 
required? Is it impossible to do the same task without it? 
For each function and extended functionality available, does it allow a user to 
gather any information about the OS?
