When attempting to play Borderlands 3 the game will keep minimising itself
instead of starting. Took a little while to realise that exiting PowerTools
returned the correct functionality.
# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.17763.805
    PowerToys version: Original version (will load latest tonight and try again came to report and found new version)
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones (I suspect)
# Steps to reproduce
Run Borderlands 3 with PowerTools running in the system tray.
# Expected behavior
Borderlands runs full screen.
# Actual behavior
Borderlands keeps disappearing back to a minimised icon on the task bar.
