### Description

I am upgrading from Angular 2 beta.17 to the latest version. When using `http.get` with specific headers to access an authentication-restricted area of my website, I encounter an error.

#### Code Example

```typescript
let headers = new Headers({
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Basic *password*='
});
let options = new RequestOptions({ headers: headers });

return this.http
    .get(this.callback, options)
    .map(this.extractData);
```

### Current Behavior

When making the HTTP GET request, the following exception is thrown:

```
Uncaught EXCEPTION: Error in backoffice/funeral-events/event-death.component.html:30:9
ORIGINAL EXCEPTION: TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of null

```

### Expected Behavior

The HTTP GET request should return an observable that can be subscribed to without any exceptions. The current behavior is unexpected and difficult to diagnose, especially after the upgrade.

Interestingly, if I remove the `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` header, the request succeeds, and I can extract the data. For now, I have removed the `application/json` part, but I believe this is a bug and am reporting it here.

### Environment

- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.5
- **Browser:** Chrome
- **Language:** TypeScript (latest)
