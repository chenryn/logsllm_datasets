I am upgrading from beta.17  
When using http.get I can give options to access auth-restricted area of my
website.
    let headers = new Headers({
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Basic *password*='
      });
    let options = new RequestOptions({ headers: headers });
    return this.http
        .get(this.callback, options)
        .map(this.extractData);
**Current behavior**

**Expected/desired behavior**
I should get an observable I can call subscribe on, and no exception like this
one. I had a really hard time to understand why this code failed when
upgrading.
What is strange is that when I remove
     'Content-Type': 'application/json',
the call is made and I can extract my data.  
So for now I just remove the `application/json` part. But I think it's a bug
so I report it
