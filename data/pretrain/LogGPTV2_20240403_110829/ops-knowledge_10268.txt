User: To achieve something similar to google app engines 'deferred calls' (i.e., the request is handled, and afterwards the deferred task is handled), i experimented a little and came up with the solution to spawn a thread in which my deferred call is handled.
I am now trying to determine if this is an acceptable way.
Is it possible (according to the WSGI specification) that the process is terminated by the webserver after the actual request is handled, but before all threads run out?
(if there's a better way, that would be also fine)
Assistant: WSGI does not specify the lifetime of an application process (as WSGI application is a Python callable object). You can run it in a way that is completely independent of the web server, in which case, only you control the lifetime.
There is also nothing in the WSGI that would prohibit you from spawning threads, or processes, or doing whatever the hell you want.
