The following containment steps can be done concurrently as new threat vectors are discovered.
Step 1: Assess the scope of the situation
- Which user accounts were compromised?
- Which devices are affected?
- Which applications are affected?
Step 2: Preserve existing systems
- Disable all privileged user accounts except for a small number of accounts used by your admins to assist in resetting the integrity of your AD DS infrastructure. If you believe a user account is compromised, disable it immediately.
- Isolate compromised systems from the network, but don't shut them off.
- Isolate at least one known good domain controller in every domain-two is even better. Either disconnect them from the network or shut them down entirely. The object is to stop the spread of ransomware to critical systems-identity being among the most vulnerable. If all your domain controllers are virtual, ensure that the virtualization platform's system and data drives are backed up to offline external media that isn't connected to the network, in case the virtualization platform itself is compromised.
- Isolate critical known good application servers, for example SAP, configuration management database (CMDB), billing, and accounting systems.
These two steps can be done concurrently as new threat vectors are discovered. Disable those threat vectors and then try to find a known good system to isolate from the network.
Other tactical containment actions can include:
- [Reset the krbtgt password](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/ad-forest-recovery-resetting-the-krbtgt-password), twice in rapid succession. Consider using a [scripted, repeatable process](https://github.com/microsoft/New-KrbtgtKeys.ps1). This script enables you to reset the krbtgt account password and related keys while minimizing the likelihood of Kerberos authentication issues being caused by the operation. To minimize potential issues, the krbtgt lifetime can be reduced one or more times prior to the first password reset so that the two resets are done quickly. Note that all domain controllers that you plan to keep in your environment must be online.
- Deploy a Group Policy to the entire domain(s) that prevents privileged login (Domain Admins) to anything but domain controllers and privileged administrative-only workstations (if any).
- Install all missing security updates for operating systems and applications. Every missing update is a potential threat vector that adversaries can quickly identify and exploit. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's [Threat and Vulnerability Management](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt) provides an easy way to see exactly what is missing-as well as the potential impact of the missing updates.
  - For Windows 10 (or higher) devices, confirm that the current version (or n-1) is running on every device.
  - Deploy [attack surface reduction (ASR) rules](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment) to prevent malware infection.
  - Enable all [Windows 10 security features](/windows/security/threat-protection/overview-of-threat-mitigations-in-windows-10).
- Check that every external facing application, including VPN access, is protected by multifactor authentication, preferably using an authentication application that is running on a secured device.
- For devices not using Defender for Endpoint as their primary antivirus software, run a full scan with [Microsoft Safety Scanner](/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download) on isolated known good systems before reconnecting them to the network.
- For any legacy operating systems, upgrade to a supported OS or decommission these devices. If these options are not available, take every possible measure to isolate these devices, including network/VLAN isolation, Internet Protocol security (IPsec) rules, and sign-in restrictions, so they are only accessible to the applications by the users/devices to provide business continuity.
The riskiest configurations consist of running mission critical systems on legacy operating systems as old as Windows NT 4.0 and applications, all on legacy hardware. Not only are these operating systems and applications insecure and vulnerable, if that hardware fails, backups typically can't be restored on modern hardware. Unless replacement legacy hardware is available, these applications cease to function. Strongly consider converting these applications to run on current operating systems and hardware.
### Post-incident activities
DART recommends implementing the following security recommendations and best practices after each incident.
- Ensure that best practices are in place for [email and collaboration solutions](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/defender-for-office-365) to make it more difficult for attackers to abuse them while allowing internal users to access external content easily and safely.
- Follow [Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) security best practices for remote access solutions to internal organizational resources.
- Starting with critical impact administrators, follow best practices for account security including using [passwordless authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/the-passwordless-future-is-here-for-your-microsoft-account/) or MFA.
- Implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of privileged access compromise.
  - For cloud and forest/domain administrative access, use Microsoft's [privileged access model (PAM)](#pam).
  - For endpoint administrative management, use the [local administrative password solution (LAPS)](#laps).
- Implement data protection to block ransomware techniques and to confirm rapid and reliable recovery from an attack.
- Review your critical systems. Check for protection and backups against deliberate attacker erasure or encryption. It's important that you periodically test and validate these backups.
- Ensure rapid detection and remediation of common attacks on endpoint, email, and identity.
- Actively discover and continuously improve the security posture of your environment.
- Update organizational processes to manage major ransomware events and streamline outsourcing to avoid friction.
### PAM
Using the [PAM](/security/compass/privileged-access-access-model) (formerly known as the tiered administration model) enhances Microsoft Entra ID's security posture, which involves:
  - Breaking out administrative accounts in a "planed" environment-one account for each level, usually four:
- Control Plane (formerly Tier 0): Administration of domain controllers and other crucial identity services, such as Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or Microsoft Entra Connect, which also includes server applications that require administrative permissions to AD DS, such as Exchange Server.
- The next two planes were formerly Tier 1:
  - Management Plane: Asset management, monitoring, and security.
  - Data/Workload Plane: Applications and application servers.
- The next two planes were formerly Tier 2:
  - User Access: Access rights for users (such as accounts).
  - App Access: Access rights for applications.
- Each one of these planes have a *separate administrative workstation for each plane* and only have access to systems in that plane. Other accounts from other planes are denied access to workstations and servers in the other planes through user rights assignments set to those machines.
The net result of the PAM is that:
- A compromised user account only has access to the plane to which it belongs.
- More sensitive user accounts won't be logging into workstations and servers with a lower plane's security level, thereby reducing lateral movement.
### LAPS
By default, Microsoft Windows and AD DS have no centralized management of local administrative accounts on workstations and member servers. This can result in a common password that is given for all these local accounts, or at the very least in groups of machines. This situation enables would-be attackers to compromise one local administrator account, and then use that account to gain access to other workstations or servers in the organization.
Microsoft's [LAPS](/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-laps) mitigates this by using a Group Policy client-side extension that changes the local administrative password at regular intervals on workstations and servers according to the policy set. Each of these passwords are different and stored as an attribute in the AD DS computer object. This attribute can be retrieved from a simple client application, depending on the permissions assigned to that attribute.
LAPS requires the AD DS schema to be extended to allow for the additional attribute, the LAPS Group Policy templates to be installed, and a small client-side extension to be installed on every workstation and member server to provide the client-side functionality.
You can get LAPS from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46899).
