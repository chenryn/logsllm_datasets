### Coverage and Interconnection Analysis

#### AS-Level and Router-Level Interconnections
- **Figure 2:**
  - **AS-Level Interconnections (Left Graph)**
  - **Router-Level Interconnections (Right Graph)**
  - This figure illustrates the interdomain interconnections discovered by bdrmap, along with the number of these interconnections that appeared in traceroutes to M-Lab and Speedtest.net servers in January 2017. The data shows that only a few AS and router-level interconnections discovered by bdrmap were covered using M-Lab servers. In contrast, Speedtest.net servers provided better coverage for both AS and router-level interconnections.

#### Methodology
- **Domain Resolution and Tracerouting:**
  - We used Ark Vantage Points (VPs) to resolve the IP addresses of extracted domains. The resolved IP addresses vary per VP because we use the DNS server of the ISP hosting the VP. These IP addresses are referred to as "Alexa targets."
  - Traceroutes were performed from each VP to each Alexa target IP address, as well as to all M-Lab and Speedtest.net servers.
  - The traceroute data was processed using bdrmap to identify both router-level and AS-level interdomain interconnections of the VP network traversed on those paths.

- **Limitations:**
  - A limitation of this methodology is that it uses paths from within the access ISP toward the testing servers and content sources, and does not provide visibility into paths in the opposite direction. However, previous studies have shown that path asymmetry at the AS-level is significantly less pronounced than at the router-level.

#### Peer Interconnections
- **Figure 3:**
  - **AS-Level Peer Interconnections (Left Graph)**
  - **Router-Level Peer Interconnections (Right Graph)**
  - This figure shows the peer interconnections discovered by bdrmap, along with the number of these interconnections that appeared in traceroutes to M-Lab and Speedtest.net servers in January 2017. Across VPs, only a subset of peer interconnections were covered using M-Lab and Speedtest.net. Speedtest.net servers provided better coverage for both AS and router-level peer interconnections compared to M-Lab.

#### Data Visualization
- **Coverage Comparison:**
  - The figures include visual representations of the coverage for both AS-level and router-level interconnections. The y-axis represents the percentage or count of interconnections, while the x-axis lists the different VPs and their corresponding identifiers (e.g., COM-1, TW-1, etc.).

- **Interconnection Types:**
  - The interconnections are categorized as follows:
    - Mlab-Alexa
    - Alexa-Mlab
    - Speedtest-Alexa
    - Alexa-Speedtest

- **Graph Scales:**
  - For AS-level interconnections, the scale ranges from 0% to 100%.
  - For router-level interconnections, the scale ranges from 1 to 1000.
