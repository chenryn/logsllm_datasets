(a) Coverage of AS-level interconnections
(b) Coverage of router-level interconnections
Figure 2: Per Ark VP, AS-level (left graph) and router-level (right graph) interdomain interconnections discovered by bdrmap, and
number of those interconnections appearing in traceroutes to M-Lab and Speedtest.net servers in January 2017. Across Ark VPs, only
a few AS and router-level interconnections discovered by bdrmap were covered using M-Lab servers. Speedtest.net servers provided
better coverage of both AS and router-level interconnections than M-Lab.
VP, to resolve the extracted domain’s IP addresses. The resolved IP
addresses differ per VP because we use the DNS server of the ISP
hosting the VP. We refer to this set of IP addresses as the Alexa
targets. We then performed traceroutes from each VP toward each
Alexa target IP address in our list, as well as to all M-Lab and
Speedtest.net servers. We processed the traceroutes toward Alexa
targets, M-Lab servers and Speedtest.net servers, using the output
of bdrmap to identify both router-level and AS-level interdomain
interconnections of the VP network traversed on those paths.
We acknowledge that a limitation of this methodology is that
we use paths from within the access ISP toward the testing servers
and content sources, and do not have visibility into paths in the op-
posite direction. Previous studies have shown, however, that path
asymmetry at the AS-level is signiﬁcantly less pronounced than at

(a) Coverage of AS-level peer interconnections
(b) Coverage of router-level peer interconnections
Figure 3: Per Ark VP, AS-level (left graph) and router-level (right graph) peer interconnections discovered by bdrmap, and the
number of those interconnections appearing in traceroutes to M-Lab and Speedtest.net servers in January 2017. Across VPs, only a
subset of peer interconnections are covered using M-Lab and Speedtest.net. Speedtest.net servers provided better coverage of both
AS and router-level peer interconnections than M-Lab.
