It would be great to have the option to disable some remaps.
**Scenario:**
  * 4 remapped keys
  * Laptop with external usb keyboard which is used occasionally.
  * When using external keyboard 2 of the remaps are not needed.
  * I have the option to disable the whole functionality but for this scenario it would be really useful to be able to disable just the remaps that I don't want.
