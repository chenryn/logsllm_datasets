User: I'm implementing a messaging system where external programs called agents are able to communicate via ZeroMq producers. So, every time an event of interest occurs, agent sends a message to ZeroMq. 
I'm interested in implementing this using pipeline pattern.
I found some examples (Ventilator-Worker-Results Manager), but Ventilator component creates an endpoint for accepting connections from the worker, and then sends all messages in batch. 
My scenario is quite different. The "agent" connects every time an event is needed to be send - it doesn't wait for connections from the workers, so I'm wondering if this is possible? Also, the important fact is that messages have to be processed in order they were sent.
Assistant: REQ-REP is when you want a round trip.  Sounds like you want a PUB-SUB.  Set up a SUB with a bind at a well-known port, then have the clients connect to that port and issue a PUB.
