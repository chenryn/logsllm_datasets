**User:**
I made a mistake by installing multiple versions of Python on my Linux machine using Anaconda. Currently, my default Python version is 2.7.11. I want to remove all versions of Python and their dependencies from my system. What steps should I take?

**Assistant:**
To remove all versions of Python and their dependencies from your Linux system, follow these steps:

1. **Uninstall Anaconda:**
   - First, remove Anaconda by running the following command:
     ```bash
     conda install anaconda-clean
     anaconda-clean --yes
     rm -rf ~/anaconda3
     ```
   - Additionally, you may need to remove any environment variables related to Anaconda. Check your shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) for lines that reference Anaconda and remove them.

2. **Remove System-Wide Python Installations:**
   - If you installed Python versions using your package manager (e.g., `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu or `yum` for CentOS/RHEL), you can remove them with the following commands:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get remove --purge python*  # For Debian/Ubuntu
     sudo yum remove python*              # For CentOS/RHEL
     ```

3. **Remove Manually Installed Python Versions:**
   - If you manually installed Python in specific directories, you can remove them by navigating to those directories and deleting the Python installations. For example:
     ```bash
     sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python*
     sudo rm -rf /opt/Python-*
     ```

4. **Verify Removal:**
   - After removing the Python installations, verify that they are no longer present by checking the available Python versions:
     ```bash
     which python
     which python3
     ```

5. **Reinstall Desired Python Version:**
   - Once all previous versions are removed, you can reinstall the desired version of Python using your package manager or by downloading the source code from the official Python website.

**Note:** Manually deleting files from `/Library/Python` (which is typically found on macOS) is not recommended on Linux systems. Instead, use the above methods to ensure a clean and complete removal.
