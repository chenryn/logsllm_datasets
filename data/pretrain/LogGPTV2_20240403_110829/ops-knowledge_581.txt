User: I made a mistake and installed many different versions of python on my linux machine. I installed all the versions of python with the help of anaconda. My default python version shows 2.7.11.
Now I want to remove all the versions of python and its dependencies from my linux system. What should I do?
Assistant: You can try going to: 

/Library/Python

and manually delete the versions you do not want. This isn't recommended though.
