User: I have downloaded Add-on SDK and executed activate.
Python 2.7 is installed. PATH variable is configured properly and py files can run from anywhere.
However, when i am trying to execute cfx (from Far command prompt, using the full path), i get the message: 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command. How do i make it run?
Assistant: Just install Python 2.6 instead of Python 2.7. When i tried with Python 2.7 i got also the same error. Then i removed Python 2.7 and installed Python 2.6. And all worked finely.
