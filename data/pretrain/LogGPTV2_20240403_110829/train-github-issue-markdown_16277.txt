# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.836]
    PowerToys version: I tried on v `0.18.1`, but downgraded to `0.17` (because of #3357)
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): Image Resizer, File Explorer
# Steps to reproduce
First of all, it's important to mention I didn't install Power Toys via the
.exe, but I used scoop to install and keep up to date with each release.
  1. Open Power Toys -> General settings -> enable File Explorer and Image Resizer
  2. Open File explorer and check the preview panel
  3. Select an image, right click on it to open the context menu and look for the "Image resize" option
# Expected behavior
I expected to see the new entry for Image Resizer in the context menu and for
the Preview panel to work according to the specs
#Mentions
  * I have already checked #1922. I have no entry in the Registry for anything like `ImageResizer`.
  * I tried uninstalling Power Toys and re-installing it. (Again, via scoop).
  * I tried both with and without Administrator rights
