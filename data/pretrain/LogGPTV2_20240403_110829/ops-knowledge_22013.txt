User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache Forbidden: httpd.conf or File Permissions When setting up an Apache virtual host, I'll occasionally get the following error when attempting to access the site.

Forbidden
You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Is there any method to (or tool that will) tell me why Apache is denying access? (local rule in httpd.conf, file permissions, etc.
I'm not looking for help with a specific configuration, instead I'm looking for a way to have the computer tell me what's wrong with my system and/or configuration.

Assistant: Apache should be generating a log file that will help you with troubleshooting.  On Debian systems, it's located in the '/var/log/apache2' directory.  Your configuration file will have the location of the log file in it.  In Debian, this is located in '/etc/apache2/sites-available/default'.
