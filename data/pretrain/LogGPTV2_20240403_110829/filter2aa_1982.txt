So You Survived The Apocalypse
Good For You
Now What?
Inspiration
● Visited Oslo for Hackcon 2008
● First time in a country that had been occupied
● Visited the resistance museum in Oslo
● Zack pointed out his phone compared to home 
build radios in the display
● One photo in particular stood out:
April 9, 1940
February 7, 2008
Inspiration
● Norwegian 
Resistance in WW2
● Hackers to the bone
● Survived long periods 
off grid, hiding from a 
lethal, roaming 
enemy
● Built their own 
equipment, radios, 
weapons
● Highly effective
● Modern urban 
dwellers
● Utterly fail to 
understand most 
devices they own
● Turn into piles of goo 
during Blackberry 
outages
● No one repairs things 
anymore
Inspiration
● What would I do in case of invasion?
● Answer wasn't confidence boosting
● Looking at others wasn't helping either
● Idea mulled around for a while till watching 
'Dawn of the Dead' while drunk
● I'd be useless in the zombie apocalypse
● How can I make myself more useful?
● How can I help short cut rebuilding?
● Can I do it without getting weird?
Inspiration
● Treat it as a hacker problem
● Disaster planning and recovery on a planetary 
level – Business continuity on a global scale
● Hackerspaces a natural learning/teaching 
ground
● What if? Is not a bad thing to ask about 
anything
● Motivated after losing massive amounts of data
● Urban-survivalists not much help
Side Note: The Colony
● New show on 
Discovery
● Talk started long 
before production
● Good to see the topic 
getting attention
● Seems very 
controlled and 
contrived
Side Note: The Colony
● Can't accurately 
represent end-of-the-
world
● Can't kill marauders
● It's a TV show, there's 
only so much they 
can do/show 
● There's a camera guy 
standing there!
Disasters
● Large or small, they suck.  Big ones suck 
harder
● Are we ready to rebuild from scratch?
● Research has been personally illuminating
● A way to better ones self with a purpose
● An excuse to watch 200 hours of movies and 
TV shows
● A large thought experiment, your thoughts 
welcome afterward
Need To Plan! But for What?
● A lot written about 
short term survival
● What about long 
term?
● Surviving disasters of 
months?  Years? 
Decades?
● How do you reboot 
society after a crash?
Disaster Scales
● Theprez98 covered short term, small impact
● I'm thinking big, huge, mega disasters
● Not Life ending but damn close
● Preparation beyond 
Hurricane/Blizzard/Flood/Earthquake kits
● Also thinking about low intensity, high impact 
disasters
Pop Culture
● No good resources found, so I turned to pop-
culture
● Dozens of Zombie and disaster movies
● 'Zombie Survival Guide' & 'World War Z' – By 
Max Brooks
● Science Fiction has thought more about this 
than most, a good starting point
● Good research for identifying problems, fun too!
● Not many good ideas for the 'now what' part, 
usually stops at 'we've survived' part
Disaster Type 1: Aw, Crap Disasters
● Solar Flare
● Grid Fail
● Ice Storm
● Enough to overwhelm 
and disable rescue 
infrastructure
● Can be sorted out in 
time
● Low intensity but far 
reaching
Solar Flare
● Ground Voltage goes to about 5000V
● Happened in Quebec in 1989
● Whats happens when it hits all of North 
America?
● Asia can't build enough replacements soon 
enough
● A tough period of being on your own
● Add weather (winter) and problem expands
Grid Fail
● National power grid a tangled mess
● Northeast blackout of 1965
● Maintenance issue cascades into the N.E. US
● Very little crime or looting
● New York blackout 1977
● Massive crime, looting, arson
● Hot summer heatwave, depressed economy
● Northeast blackout of 2003
● Almost no crime, a strange and calm event
● Will the next one be calm?
Disaster Type 2: We're Boned
● 'Small' Meteorite
● 'Strategic' Earthquake
● Etc
● Don't care who or 
where you are, this is 
gonna suck
● Recovery takes years
● Higher intensity, 
small-medium impact
“Small” Meteorite
● Something that makes a state go away 
suddenly
● http://simulator.down2earth.eu – Google map 
mashup of crater size
● No really good defense
● Effects felt throughout the world
● Not life ending, just a big pothole on life's 
highway
“Strategic” Earthquake
● Strategic - meaning naturally occurring with an 
additional “screw you” attached
● Isla De le Palma - Cumbre Vieja
● Volcanic Isle in the Canary Islands
● Splitting right down the middle
● 500sq/Km ridge aimed straight at US East Coast
● 30-60m high tsunami, going about 25km inland
● Figure out the net effect of that!
● Mother Nature is a bitch sometimes
Disaster Type 3: I Wish I Weren't 
Undead
● Dead have risen (No, 
Not Jesus)
● Walking Plague of 
Zombies (Don't care if 
they are fast or slow!)
● No rescue, no outside 
support
● You are on your own
● Disaster constant and 
ongoing, containment 
unlikely
Hacking Disasters
● Hackers are smart 
and creative
● If we can survive the 
short term how can 
we can make 
ourselves useful in 
the long term
● No knowledge is bad
● Hackers: Keepers of 
Lost Knowledge
Hacking Disasters: Preparation
● Planning and 
hoarding only go so 
far
● Personal education 
goes farther
● I am my own test 
subject
● I have or intend to try 
most everything I talk 
about
Vulnerability Assessment
● We are rapidly 
forgetting how we got 
here
● Even Makers can't 
Make everything
● We've forgotten more 
than we know
● This generation might 
be alright, but what 
about the next
Vulnerability Assessment
● Basic building blocks are not there anymore
● Classical scientists had to be polymath's
● Highly integrated to 'the grid'
● What happens when the grid goes away?
● Thousands of people involved in every product 
and tech.  What happens when most go away?
● Lack of danger in our lives
● Consider a Pencil, Consider a Toaster
A Pencil
Leonard Read, I Pencil
A Toaster
● UK Artist Thomas 
Thwaites attempts to 
build a $5 toaster 
from the ground up
● FAIL!
● Proved that the 
average person 
cannot create even 
the most mundane 
thing on their own
Knowledge Is The Best Weapon
● Knowledge is the 
most underestimated 
survival tool
● 500 years of trial and 
error – forgotten
● Why waste time 
recreating knowledge
● Learn it ourselves 
and pass it on
Knowledge
Ever Since The World Ended – Yes that is Adam Savage
    "A human being should be able to change a 
diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a 
ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance 
accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the 
dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act 
alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, 
pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty 
meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization 
is for insects."
    — Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for Love 
Heinlein said it well...

all

just need the how-to-do

● Refrigeration – “A liquified gas in a sealed, 
cyclical pipe is allowed to expand, drawing heat 
from it's surroundings.  An in-line compressor 
re-compresses the gas to repeat the process“
Knowledge Banks
● Disasters are unpredictable
● You can't know everything, but you can store it

● The more ideas the 
better
