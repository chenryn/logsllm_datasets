## Introduction
Congratulations, you survived the apocalypse. Now what? This presentation explores how to rebuild society in the aftermath of a disaster, drawing inspiration from historical and fictional scenarios.

## Inspiration
- **Oslo Visit (Hackcon 2008)**: First visit to a country that had been occupied. Visited the resistance museum in Oslo.
- **Norwegian Resistance in WW2**: Known for their resourcefulness and resilience, they survived off-grid, built their own equipment, and were highly effective.
- **Modern Urban Dwellers**: Often lack basic survival skills and are heavily reliant on technology.
- **Personal Reflection**: What would I do in case of an invasion? Watching "Dawn of the Dead" while drunk led to the realization that I'd be useless in a zombie apocalypse. How can I make myself more useful and help shortcut the rebuilding process?

## Approach
- **Treat it as a Hacker Problem**: Apply hacker thinking to disaster planning and recovery on a planetary scale.
- **Hackerspaces as Learning Grounds**: Use hackerspaces for teaching and learning essential skills.
- **Thought Experiment**: A way to better oneself with a purpose, and an excuse to watch 200 hours of movies and TV shows.

## Need to Plan! But for What?
- **Short-term vs. Long-term Survival**: While there is a lot written about short-term survival, long-term survival strategies are less explored.
- **Disaster Scales**: 
  - **Type 1: Aw, Crap Disasters**: Solar Flare, Grid Fail, Ice Storm. These can overwhelm and disable rescue infrastructure but can be sorted out over time.
  - **Type 2: We're Boned**: 'Small' Meteorite, 'Strategic' Earthquake. Recovery takes years, and the impact is high.
  - **Type 3: I Wish I Weren't Undead**: Zombie Apocalypse. No rescue, no outside support, and ongoing containment issues.

## Hacking Disasters
- **Hackers are Smart and Creative**: If we can survive the short term, how can we make ourselves useful in the long term?
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: We are rapidly forgetting how we got here. Even makers can't make everything, and this generation might be alright, but what about the next?
- **Knowledge is the Best Weapon**: Learn from 500 years of trial and error. Specialization is for insects; a well-rounded skill set is essential.

## Communication
- **HAM Operators**: Invaluable in disaster scenarios. Minimal parts, can be found and improvised.
- **Fox Hole Radio**: Used in WW2, built out of scrap parts at hand.
- **Transmission is Key**: Share knowledge with other survivors. "Radio Free Earth" from World War Z is a good example.

## Agriculture
- **Sustainability**: Small seed banks in 'go-bags', knowledge of local botany, and useful plants.
- **Svalbard Global Seed Vault**: Last ditch storehouse for food-producing crop seeds. Coordinates: 78.238166°N 15.447236°E.
- **Hemp**: Incredibly useful plant for rope, paper, foodstuffs, cloth, fuel, etc. Low maintenance and low pesticide requirements.

## Tools and Weapons
- **Halligan Bar**: Built for firefighting, rescue, and zombie killing. Multiple tools in one.
- **Guns and Ammo**: Knowledge and licenses are important. Think beyond the short term.
- **Swords and Machetes**: Useful for multiple purposes, need to know how to use them. Fencing lessons are recommended.

## Fashion and Function
- **Survival Tac Gear**: Just because the world has ended doesn't mean style doesn't matter. Prepare your own gear ahead of time.
- **Blacksmithing**: Make your own weapons, tools, and parts. Easy to start, hard to master.

## Brewing and Distillation
- **Turn Waste into Alcohol**: Brew beers, distill spirits, ferment wine. Ethanol for fuel, Molotov cocktails for defense, and disinfectants for hygiene.

## Engines and Steam Power
- **Repairing Old Engines**: Easier than modern ones. Small engines are fuel-efficient and easy to maintain.
- **Steam Power**: Simple source of power for generators, pumps, heaters, refrigeration, etc. Worked for 100 years, why not again?

## The Gilligan Factor
- **The Professor**: Built innumerable things to make life easier and kept castaways sane. We need to be like the professor.
- **Mary-Ann**: Kansas farm girl who knew which end of a nail was sharp. Vastly under-rated character on the show.
- **Human Factor**: People don't handle adversity well. Provide small comforts to keep morale up.

## Books and Knowledge Banks
- **Henley's 20th Century Formulas**: Available on archive.org. Over 800 pages of useful information.
- **Pocket Ref**: Full of useful formulas, specifications, and random bits of knowledge.
- **Crowd-Sourced Knowledge Bank**: User-editable content, distilled down to a Twitter post. High-density knowledge book.
- **Geo-Caching and Peer-to-Peer Storage**: Combine for added knowledge safety.

## Conclusion
- **More Ideas, Better Outcomes**: Want to hear ideas, comments, etc., for preserving knowledge and rebooting society.
- **Inspiration**: Hopefully, some of you will be inspired to contribute to this thought experiment.
