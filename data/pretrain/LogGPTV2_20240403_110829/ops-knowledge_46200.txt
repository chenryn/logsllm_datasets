Configure the network environment In a virtualized environment, the network is the communication bridge between the virtual machine and the physical server, so the network environment needs to be configured properly. Including VLAN settings, network isolation, network optimization, etc. 4. Create a virtual machine Create a virtual machine in the IaaS cloud platform, set the configuration, operating system, etc. of the virtual machine according to the requirements, and set up the network and storage of the virtual machine. 5. Manage virtual machines In order to ensure the stability and security of the IaaS cloud platform, virtual machines need to be managed.

Including access control, identity authentication, authority management, data encryption, security audit, etc., to ensure the security and credibility of the cloud platform. Summary: Creating and managing an IaaS cloud platform requires comprehensive knowledge of virtualization technology, network technology, and security technology. In order to successfully land, it is also necessary to consider the layout of the data center, fault recovery and many other details. At the same time, cloud platforms can be quickly created and managed with the help of cloud platform provider solutions.
