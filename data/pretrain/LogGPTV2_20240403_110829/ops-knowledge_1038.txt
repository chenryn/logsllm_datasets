Assistant: At 20:10:57, two tasks (1138 and 1141) were assigned and running. The system also found five blocks of data (rdd_16_0-4) locally. The File Output Committer Algorithm version was set to 1. Additionally, the PythonRunner reported times for total, boot, init, and finish. Finally, the output of task 83 was saved to a HDFS location.
