### Issue with Exporting Roughness and Metal Maps in Three.js Editor

When creating a model in the Three.js editor and attempting to export it as a GLB or GLTF file, the roughness and metal maps are not being exported. This issue occurs whether the maps are combined into a single AO/Rough/Metal RGB image or as individual images.

#### Problem Description
- **Combined Image**: When I try to apply a combined AO/Rough/Metal RGB image in the editor and then export it as a GLTF file, the exporter ignores these maps. The exporter claims that the images are not the same, even though they are (in the case of a hand-merged file).
- **Individual Images**: Similarly, when I use individual roughness and metal maps, they are also ignored during the export process.
- **AO Map Export**: Interestingly, if I export only the AO map (which is the same image), it is successfully included in the exported GLTF file.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a model in the Three.js editor.
2. Apply the roughness and metal maps, either as a combined AO/Rough/Metal RGB image or as individual images.
3. Export the model as a GLTF file.
4. Reimport the GLB file into the editor.
5. Observe that the roughness and metal maps are missing.

#### Environment
- **Three.js Version**: r.96
- **Browser**: Chrome
- **Operating System**: Windows 10

#### Question
Is there a way to ensure that the exporter correctly identifies and exports the roughness and metal maps, whether they are part of a combined image or individual images?
