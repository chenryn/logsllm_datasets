Creating a model in Three.js/editor and exporting with roughness or metal maps
to GLB or GLTF will not export the rough/metal maps whether they are combined
as a single file AO/Rough/Metal RGB or as individual images.
I'm trying to apply these images in the Editor and export them as a gltf file.
However when the exporter ignores them because it says they are not the same
image (even though they are in the case of a hand merged file.
When I reimport the glb in the editor the images are not their, but if I
exported the AO map (same image) it is exported.
Is there a way to check that the user is trying to apply a merged image or the
same image and go ahead and export the metal roughness maps?
here is a shot of the editor before export...

And here is a shot after import with a console log showing the export problem.
