User: I have this program that at one point accesses os.getcwd(), but some times, depending on where the program has gone before getting to that line, it crashes with the message "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory". 
I cannot figure out what i can do wrong then calling os.getcwd(). There's no arguments, and there should always be a current working directory, right?
Assistant: Sommeone probably erased your filesystem while you had the Python open.
That is why Python is stating that it could not be found. This had happened to me.
