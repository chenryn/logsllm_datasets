### Overview of Cross-Signing Incidents and Revocation Inconsistencies

#### 1. **Certinomis and WoSign/StartCom Cross-Sign Incident**

**Timeline:**
- **2016-2017:** Certinomis cross-signed WoSign/StartCom, bypassing the "not before" rules set by major root stores.
- **September 2017:** Mozilla added the cross-sign to OneCRL.
- **October 2017:** Certinomis added the certificate to its CRL.
- **Mid 2019:** Distrust of Certinomis due to the incident.

**Details:**
- **Cross-Sign Bypass:** The new Certinomis cross-sign established a trust path to a root not operated by WoSign or StartCom, enabling StartCom to issue valid certificates despite its ban.
- **Revocation Actions:**
  - **Mozilla:** Added the cross-sign to OneCRL in September 2017.
  - **Certinomis:** Added the certificate to its CRL in October 2017.
- **Impact:**
  - The cross-sign provided undesired valid trust paths for about 6 months.
  - 11 certificates were affected, observed in a small number of connections during this period.
  - This incident highlighted the complexity of revocation when cross-signing is involved.

**Other Cross-Signs:**
- **Keynectic’s Certplus Class 1 Primary CA:** Cross-signed three WoSign CA certificates, but no undesired trust paths were created due to Microsoft's "not before" rule.
- **WoSign’s Internal Intermediates:** Four intermediate XS-Certs were not explicitly revoked, although their roots were revoked.
- **Comodo and Unizeto Certum CA:** Explicitly revoked their cross-signs when Mozilla started to distrust WoSign in 2016.

#### 2. **DigiNotar Cross-Sign Incident (2011)**

**Timeline:**
- **2011:** Security incident at DigiNotar; attacker obtained certificates for several domains.
- **2011:** DigiNotar Root CA and cross-sign by Entrust.net Secure Server CA were revoked by Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla.
- **August 2013:** Expiry of the DigiNotar cross-sign.

**Details:**
- **Security Incident:** An attacker obtained certificates for several domains, including Google and Mozilla’s add-on domains.
- **Revocation Actions:**
  - **Microsoft:** Removed the root from its root store and blocked the intermediate.
  - **Google:** Added both certificates to Chrome’s blacklist.
  - **Mozilla:** Implemented a special revocation mechanism (OneCRL introduced in 2015).
- **Impact:**
  - Applications that base their trust on the certificates in the root stores of Mozilla, Google, or Microsoft were at risk of accepting DigiNotar-issued certificates up to two years after the distrust due to the cross-sign.

#### 3. **Incomplete Vendor-Controlled CRLs**

**Examples:**
- **Actalis Authentication CA G2:** Cross-signed by Baltimore CyberTrust Root. The cross-sign was not consistently revoked across different vendor-controlled CRLs, affecting 13 certificates for two years.
- **GlobalSign Extended Validation CA - SHA256 - G2:** The cross-sign by GlobalSign Root CA - R3 was not revoked, leading to inconsistencies in OneCRL and CRLSet.
- **Entrust Certification Authority - L1E:** The cross-sign by Entrust.net Certification Authority (2048) was not revoked for seven months after the corresponding intermediates were revoked.
- **US Federal PKI Intermediates:** Inconsistent revocation states for DoD Interoperability Root CA 2, NASA Operational CA, and DHS CA4.
- **Belgium Root CA2:** Special request for inclusion in OneCRL, but not in other vendor-controlled CRLs, leading to a narrow-band revocation.

**Takeaway:**
- **Cross-Signing Consequences:** Incomplete revocations and new valid trust paths for already revoked certificates add a further burden to the fragile revocation mechanisms in PKIs.
- **Proposed Solutions:**
  - Adapted mechanisms to ease revocation in the presence of cross-signing.
  - Public disclosure and explanation of inconsistencies by CAs.

#### 4. **PKI Barrier Breaches**

**Example: Federal PKI (FPKI)**
- **Background:** FPKI provides PKI functionality for US government services and was part of Apple and Microsoft root programs until 2018 but never accepted by Mozilla.
- **Cross-Signs:**
  - **IdenTrust ACES CA 1:** Cross-signed Federal Bridge CA 2013, providing broad trust coverage.
  - **VeriSign Class 3 SSP Intermediate CA - G2:** Cross-signed FPKI CA, expanding trust until revocation.
- **Impact:**
  - Many applications using the Mozilla root store unknowingly trusted FPKI-issued certificates.
  - Potential political influence in state-controlled PKI systems raises concerns.

**Further Trust Paths:**
- **Federal Common Policy Root:** Cross-signed by Federal Bridge CA and Federal Bridge CA 2013, distributing trust further.
- **SHA-1 Federal Root CA:** Cross-signed by FPKI Federal Common Policy, VeriSign, and FBCA Common Policy, expanding trust deeper into the FPKI.

**Conclusion:**
- **Cross-Signing Risks:** Can lead to unintended trust paths and incomplete revocations, highlighting the need for improved revocation mechanisms and public transparency.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Enhanced revocation mechanisms.
  - Public disclosure of cross-signing practices and revocation inconsistencies.
  - Regular audits and monitoring of cross-signing activities.
