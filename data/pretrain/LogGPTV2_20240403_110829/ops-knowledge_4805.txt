User: I installed Twisted for Python and I am trying to build a simple server on Eclipse and I am getting the following error:
ImportError: No module named zope.interface
I'm not sure how to correct this.  Doesn't Twisted install all of the dependencies first?
Assistant: Make sure you:

Have PyDev installed
Have twisted / zope.interface installed and in your PYTHONPATH.
Have configured your eclipse project as a python/pydev project.
Have configured the interpreter in the Eclipse environment (Pydev settings).
