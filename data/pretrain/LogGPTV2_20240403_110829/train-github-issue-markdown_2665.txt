When attempting to build the latest Git tree, identified by `git describe --tags` as `v1.3.0-rc1-2262-g74cfc64734`, I encountered the following error:

```
ERROR: /build/tensorflow-git/src/tensorflow/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD:101:1: no such package '@llvm//': java.io.IOException: Error downloading [http://mirror.bazel.build/github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/archive/9aafb854cc7cb8df8338c50cb411a54ce1e09796.tar.gz, https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/archive/9aafb854cc7cb8df8338c50cb411a54ce1e09796.tar.gz] to /build/.cache/bazel/_bazel_builduser/a152fcd393afbe6f0b02d283bc9e6174/external/llvm/9aafb854cc7cb8df8338c50cb411a54ce1e09796.tar.gz: Checksum was e8f07137a3a0b95e143c0665cd19160dd5040114b34a48653fa7f5f91cf4c136 but wanted 2a6d4c23f6660d9130d8d5f16267db53a87f8d0104f9618b558c033570f110af and referenced by '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:licenses'.
```

The error indicates that the checksum of the downloaded LLVM archive does not match the expected value. Specifically, the observed checksum is `e8f07137a3a0b95e143c0665cd19160dd5040114b34a48653fa7f5f91cf4c136`, while the expected checksum is `2a6d4c23f6660d9130d8d5f16267db53a87f8d0104f9618b558c033570f110af`.

**Note:** The correct solution is not simply to change the expected checksum to match the observed one, as this could indicate a potential security or integrity issue with the downloaded file.

To resolve this issue, you should:
1. Verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded file.
2. Ensure that the URLs for the LLVM archive are correct and accessible.
3. Consider checking for any updates or changes in the LLVM repository that might affect the checksums.
