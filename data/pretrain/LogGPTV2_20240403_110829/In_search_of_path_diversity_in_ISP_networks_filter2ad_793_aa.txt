ABSTRACT
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can exploit path diversity to bal-
ance load and improve robustness. Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult to
evaluate the potential impact of these approaches without routing
and topological data, which are conﬁdential. In this paper, we char-
acterize path diversity in the real Sprint network. We then charac-
terize path diversity in ISP topologies inferred using the Rocket-
fuel tool. Comparing the real Sprint topology to the one inferred
by Rocketfuel, we ﬁnd that the Rocketfuel topology has signiﬁ-
cantly higher apparent path diversity. We evaluate heuristics that
improve the accuracy of the inferred Rocketfuel topologies. Fi-
nally, we discuss limitations of active measurements techniques to
capture topological properties such as path diversity.

INTRODUCTION
Path diversity is a metric that reﬂects the number of routes avail-
able to a packet to transit between two points in a network.
In
the Internet, the route is chosen hop-by-hop by a routing proto-
col among the available routes. Therefore, the path diversity of a
network directly impacts its resilience to failure (how many alter-
natives are available if a link or router fails), as well as a its ability
to support trafﬁc engineering. In this paper we consider the par-
ticular issue of IP-level path diversity in Internet Service Provider
(ISP) networks. We focus on the IP level because it represents the

lowest protocol layer that is exposed to the users 1. Moreover, it is
exactly this environment that is faced by designers of value-added
high-availability network services – such as routing overlays and
peer-to-peer networks [1, 2, 3].
By representing the network topology as a graph, in which routers
are nodes and links are edges, one can use standard graph algo-
rithms to calculate the number of node-disjoint and edge-disjoint
paths between all pairs of nodes. In practice this is rarely possible.
ISPs consider such detailed topology information both conﬁdential
and proprietary. As a result, there is considerable literature that
simply treats the network as a “black box” and infers aspects of
the topology through active measurements [1, 4, 5, 6]. However,
Spring et al. have recently developed a tool, Rocketfuel, that de-
rives precise topological maps of ISP networks using active mea-
surements [7]. These maps are widely considered to be the most
accurate IP-level topologies available to the broad research com-
munity.
In this paper, we use Rocketfuel-derived topologies to evaluate
the IP-level path diversity between Points of Presence (PoPs) in
a various ISPs. Overall, we ﬁnd that the Rocketfuel topologies
fall into two categories, those that have very limited path diversity
among PoPs and those that have signiﬁcant path diversity. For ex-
ample, the Rocketfuel map for Tiscali, an European ISP, reveals
only one PoP-disjoint path among 80% of its PoPs, whereas the
Sprint topology inferred by Rocketfuel has at least two paths be-
tween all its PoP pairs.
However, our attempts to validate these results revealed at least
one instance of substantial inaccuracies in Rocketfuel-derived data.
We were able to obtain an exact IP-level topology of the tier-one
Sprint ISP network and found that all pairs of PoPs have at least
two PoP-disjoint paths between them, and 90% of pairs of PoPs
have a minimum of four link-disjoint paths between them. Com-
puting these same metrics over the Rocketfuel-derived topology for
Sprint suggests signiﬁcantly higher diversity. Rocketfuel overesti-
mates PoP-disjoint paths by as much as a factor of 2.5, and link-
disjoint paths by as much as a factor of 4.4. This discrepancy re-
sults from errors associated with topological inference methodol-
ogy – the inclusion of links that do not exist and the omission of
links that are actually present. Path diversity is particularly sen-
sitive to such inaccuracies since each individual link impacts the
results. By comparison, many traditional topological metrics, such
as network diameter and average pairwise shortest path [8], are rel-
atively stable in the absence of gross errors. We discuss the po-
tential sources of inaccuracy in topological inference, and evalu-
ate some initial heuristics for improving its accuracy. However,
1Path diversity at the IP level is distinct from path diversity of the
underlying switching or ﬁber infrastructure. In this work, we do
not address physical level path diversity.
even with these improvements we ﬁnd that substantial differences
remain and therefore conclude that additional work is needed be-
fore Rocketfuel-derived topologies will be appropriate for evaluat-
ing sensitive topological metrics.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents related work. Section 3 characterizes path diversity in
the Sprint topology and the Rocketfuel ISP topologies. Section 4
discusses sources of inaccuracy for path diversity in the inferred
topologies, and evaluates heuristics for improving their accuracy.
Section 5 summarizes our experiences and results of the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
There has been extensive research in the area of mechanisms
that could take advantage of path diversity. However, little work
has been done to characterize path diversity in Internet topologies.
There have been a number of efforts to map Internet topologies
using active measurements [9, 10, 7]. As part of these studies,
these efforts highlight some of the challenges to measuring net-
work topologies. They do not, however, evaluate the accuracy of
the resulting topologies as compared to a known correct network
topology or the effects of active measurement techniques on the
resulting path diversity of the inferred topologies.
Tangmunarunkit et al. [8] identify a set of metrics to evaluate
network topologies. One of these metrics is topology resilience,
which is deﬁned as the size of the cut set of a balanced bi-partition.
Resilience is related to path diversity, but it is too coarse of a metric
to characterize path diversity. In their work, they use these metrics
to discuss the accuracy of topology models when compared to net-
work topologies generated by active measurements. But, they do
not contrast measured topologies to actual network topologies.
Giroire et al. analyze the robustness of IP backbones [11]. They
study the resilience of a backbone network to ﬁber cuts and propose
solutions for ﬁnding an optimal mapping of a given IP topology to
a ﬁber infrastructure.
Akella et al. [12] study the performance and reliability bene-
ﬁts of using multihoming for high-volume servers and receivers
in the Internet. Using traceroute measurements among servers in
the Akamai content distribution network, they explore the perfor-
mance beneﬁts of multihoming where trafﬁc uses ﬁrst-hop diver-
sity of routing to different ISPs on the ﬁrst hop to the same des-
tination. Using traceroute measurements between Akamai servers
and Keynote Systems nodes in geographically diverse network lo-
cations, they also construct trees of paths from multiple Akamai
servers to individual Keynote nodes to explicitly represent the path
diversity between them. This work focuses on the path diversity en-
abled just using multihoming and standard IP routing across ISPs,
whereas our goal is to characterize the path diversity of complete
ISP topologies.
In [13], we state the problem of studying path diversity in In-
ternet topologies and illustrate it with two case studies: inside an
ISP and across multiple ISP networks. In this paper, we focus on
path diversity inside an ISP network. We expand our deﬁnition and
analysis of path diversity, and discuss the limitations of computing
path diversity using topologies generated by active measurements.
3. PATH DIVERSITY IN ISP TOPOLOGIES
Routing inside an ISP network is performed by Interior Gateway
Protocols (IGP) such as OSPF [14] and IS-IS [15]. In general, IGPs
forward packets using the shortest path to the destination. Despite
this prevalent policy of using a single path, there are some opportu-
nities for leveraging path diversity inside a network. Routing pro-
tocols use multiple paths between two points in the network either
when there is a failure or when there are multiple paths with equal
cost. In the former case, trafﬁc from a failed path is switched to a
backup path after the failure. In the latter, multiple paths are used
simultaneously to spread out trafﬁc to a destination to balance load
across paths and potentially provide higher bandwidth to the desti-
nation.
Equal-cost multipath routing is available both in OSPF [14] and
IS-IS [15]. When there are multiple paths to a destination, routers
typically choose which interface to forward a packet based on a
hash function of some of the ﬁelds that identify a TCP ﬂow. The
implementation of this hash function is vendor-speciﬁc. ISPs are
responsible for assigning weights to links to determine which paths
have equal cost, but they have no control over which speciﬁc path
a packet is forwarded on.
In this section, we characterize the path diversity in the real
Sprint topology and the inferred Rocketfuel ISP topologies. We
identify two kinds of path diversity. One can consider one ISP full
topology, i.e., all IP paths available in the absence of failure or rout-
ing constraints (including backup links). We call this type of path
diversity complete. Complete path diversity, however, is not always
available to trafﬁc traversing the ISP network because of link fail-
ures and network engineering practices (some paths may be used
only for backup purposes). We call the path diversity available at a
given moment active.
3.1 Path Diversity in the Sprint Network
We were fortunate to have access to the exact continental Sprint
US PoP-level topology under a non-disclosure agreement2. This
network is composed of 17 PoPs scattered throughout the US. PoPs
are interconnected by multiple high-bandwidth optical links (OC-
48 and OC-192), not all of which are active at a given time. Links
represent IP links between PoPs. Sprint provided annotations in the
topology that determine which links are used only as backup. In
this topology, we compute active path diversity by ignoring backup
links. Even though this is a static topology and consequently, its
path diversity represents the amount of path diversity available in
the Sprint network in the absence of failures.

Figure 1: Path diversity in the Sprint Network.
Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function of the num-
ber of link- and PoP-disjoint paths for all pairs of PoPs in the Sprint
network. The set of PoP-disjoint paths for a given pair of PoPs is
a subset of the link-disjoint paths for the same pair. Consequently,
the number of PoP-disjoint paths is no greater than the number of

link-disjoint paths. Since PoPs can fail (e.g., from power failures),
PoP-disjoint paths represent the highest amount of availability.
We present both active and complete path diversity. The solid
line represents the maximum possible number of paths for each pair
of PoPs as determined by the minimum between the out-degree of
the source PoP and the in-degree of the destination PoP. Measured
path diversity close to this limit indicates that path diversity is lim-
ited only by the degree of the PoPs.
We can see in Figure 1 that the Sprint network has a large path
diversity. When considering both link- and PoP-disjoint paths, all
pairs of PoPs have more than one path. The signiﬁcant difference
between the number of link- and PoP-disjoint paths is expected be-
cause there are multiple links connecting a pair of PoPs. The num-
ber of link-disjoint paths is relatively large. Almost 90% of pairs
of PoPs have at least four link-disjoint paths between them, and
40% of pairs of PoPs are connected through eight or more link-
disjoint paths (these are generally the most important paths as de-
ﬁned in [11]). Active path diversity represents the potential for
spreading trafﬁc in the Sprint network, whereas complete path di-
versity represents the limits of potential availability (i.e., how many
links need to fail before the network is partitioned).
Since ISP topologies are conﬁdential, and we have only been
able to obtain access the Sprint topology, we need to use topologies
generated by end-to-end measurements for other ISPs. We now
consider those generated by the Rocketfuel tool.
3.2 Path Diversity in Rocketfuel Topologies
Rocketfuel topologies are constructed from traceroute-like probes,
which identify the incoming interfaces of the routers traversed by
probes [7]. After collecting all links found by probes, Rocketfuel
applies techniques to map different interfaces in the same router to
