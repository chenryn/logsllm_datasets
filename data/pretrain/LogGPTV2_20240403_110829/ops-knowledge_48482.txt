Question: In a system where a pRNG is used for cryptographic purposes, which of the following actions could potentially compromise the security of the generated pseudorandom numbers?
"A": "Reusing the same seed over multiple initializations without any additional entropy.",
"B": "Allowing the 'Generate(n)' function to add additional entropy during the generation of pseudorandom bits.",
"C": "Updating the pRNG's internal state with new entropy through the 'Reseed(entropy)' function.",
"D": "Generating multiple sequences of pseudorandom bits without changing the initial seed."
Answer: AD
