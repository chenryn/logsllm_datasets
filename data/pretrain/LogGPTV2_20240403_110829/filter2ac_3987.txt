### Title: BlackHat US-22: Universal Android Rooting via Exploitation of Mobile GPU and Command Queue Drivers

**Abstract:**

Rooting modern Android devices using kernel vulnerabilities from an unprivileged process, without relying on hardcoded offsets or addresses, and achieving nearly a 100% success rate, is exceptionally rare. After reporting the in-the-wild CVE-2020-0069 in Mediatek's Command Queue device driver, we conducted a security review of ImgTec's PowerVR GPU device driver. During this review, we discovered and reported several such rare vulnerabilities, including GPU CVE-2021-39815. In total, we identified over 35 exploitable bugs.

This presentation will primarily focus on GPU hacking. While there have been numerous vulnerability reports about other GPUs like Mali and Adreno in recent years, Google has received only one report concerning ImgTec's PowerVR GPU. This suggests that the security risks associated with ImgTec's PowerVR GPUs have been underexplored, despite ImgTec potentially having the largest GPU market share in the Android ecosystem. Many affordable and popular devices, as well as numerous Chromebooks, use PowerVR GPUs, making the discovered vulnerabilities and exploits truly cross-platform. Additionally, these vulnerabilities affect more than ten OEMs.

Kernel memory management for both CPUs and GPUs is inherently complex, often leading to unwanted or undefined outcomes. We will delve into the design and implementation of GPU driver technologies, including kernel APIs, memory management, kernel object lifetimes, and the implementations of OpenCL internal libraries.

We will also highlight the latest SELinux policies aimed at limiting unprivileged interaction with ImgTec's PowerVR GPUs on devices and discuss methods to achieve a stable bypass. The presentation will include a detailed discussion of the exploit and a live demonstration of rooting a well-known PowerVR device.

**Key Points:**
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** Over 35 exploitable bugs in ImgTec's PowerVR GPU driver.
- **Cross-Platform Impact:** Affects multiple Android devices and Chromebooks.
- **Complexity of Kernel Management:** Discussion on the intricacies of CPU and GPU kernel memory management.
- **SELinux Policy Bypass:** Techniques for bypassing the latest SELinux policies.
- **Live Demonstration:** Rooting a well-known PowerVR device.

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the security landscape surrounding ImgTec's PowerVR GPUs and offer insights into the challenges and opportunities in this area.
