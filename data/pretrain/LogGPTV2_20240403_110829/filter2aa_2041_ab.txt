### 21. The Attacker's Access to the Victim’s Router

The attacker can now browse the victim’s router as if they were physically connected to the local area network (LAN).

#### Impact

This vulnerability affects a wide range of routers, with the most notable being the ActionTec MI424-WR. This router is distributed to all Verizon FIOS users, and the vast majority do not change the default login credentials. As of 2009, Verizon FIOS had over 3 million Internet subscribers, providing a large number of potential targets for this single router model [14].

Additionally, routers from popular vendors such as Linksys, Thomson, Belkin, Dell, and Asus are also affected. The attack has been successfully tested on routers running third-party firmware from DD-WRT, OpenWRT, and PFSense.

#### Mitigations

End users can take several steps to mitigate this type of attack:

1. **Add a Firewall Rule**: On the router, block network traffic on the internal interface that has a destination IP matching the IP address assigned to the WAN interface. Note that this rule must be updated each time the IP address of the WAN interface changes.
2. **Host-Level Firewall Rules**: Add a firewall or routing rule on each host machine in the network to block or improperly route traffic destined for the router’s public IP address. This rule must be applied to all current and future hosts on the internal network.
3. **Service Binding**: Ensure that services on the router are bound only to the LAN and/or WLAN interfaces.
4. **HTTPS Administration**: Use HTTPS for web-based administration.
5. **Disable Web Administration**: Consider disabling web-based administration entirely.

If you do not have sufficient access to your router to perform the above mitigations, consider the following:
- **JavaScript Restrictions**: Disable JavaScript or limit the sites from which you allow JavaScript to run.

#### Permanent Fixes by Firmware Authors

Firmware authors can implement the following permanent fixes to prevent this attack:

1. **Valid Host Header**: Require a valid host header in all HTTP requests. The host header should always be the IP address of the router or the router’s hostname, if it has one.
2. **Service Interface Binding**: Run services, especially the web service, only on the LAN/WLAN interfaces unless the user has enabled remote administration.
3. **Strong End System Model**: Implement the strong end system model in the router's TCP/IP stack.
