21. The attacker is now browsing around in the victim’s router as if he were on the LAN 
himself: 
Impact 
Many routers are affected, but perhaps the most notable is the ActionTec MI424-WR. This router is 
distributed to all Verizon FIOS users, the vast majority of whom never bother to change the default 
login. As of 2009, Verizon FIOS claimed over 3 million Internet subscribers, providing an attacker with 
a very large number of potential targets from this one router alone [14]. 
Additionally, routers from many popular vendors such as Linksys, Thompson, Belkin, Dell, and Asus 
are known to be affected. The attack has also been successfully tested against routers running third 
party firmware from DD-WRT, OpenWRT and PFSense.  
The following table lists the routers that were tested against Rebind, and whether or not the Rebind 
attack was successful. Where known and applicable, the hardware and firmware versions of the routers

Mitigations 
There are several fixes that can be employed by end users to mitigate this type of attack: 
1. Add a firewall rule on the router to block network traffic on the internal interface that has a 
destination IP which matches the IP address assigned to the WAN interface. Note that this rule 
will have to be updated each time the IP address of the WAN interface changes. 
2. Add a firewall or routing rule on each host machine in the network that blocks or improperly 
routes traffic destined for the router’s public IP address. Note that this rule must be applied to 
any and all current and future hosts on the internal network. 
3. Ensure that services on the router are bound only to the LAN and/or WLAN interfaces. 
4. Only run Web-based administration over HTTPS. 
5. Don't use Web-based administration at all. 
If you do not have sufficient access to your router to perform the above mitigations, preventing this 
attack can be difficult. The best option is to disable JavaScript or limit from which sites you allow 
JavaScript to run. 
There are additional permanent fixes that can be made by firmware authors to prevent this attack: 
1. Require a valid host header in all HTTP requests. The host header should always be the IP 
address of the router or the router’s host name, if it has one. 
2. Only run services, especially the Web service, on the LAN / WLAN interfaces unless the user 
has enabled remote administration. 
3. Implement the strong end system model in the router's TCP/IP stack.
