User: I have a backend that consumes a queue in its start handler.  When the queue is exhausted the start handler will stop.  I want the backend to stop when the start handler finishes.  I have other code that will send a request to the backend if it adds an item to this queue.  These requests merely serve to have GAE start the backend so that it can start consuming the queue.
I don't want the backend to ever be in a state where the start handler has finished but the backend remains idle.  I want it to stop so that the next request to the backend will cause GAE to start the backend again thus invoking the start handler again and start consuming the queue.
How do I accomplish this goal?
Assistant: Backends can't (currently) be started and stopped programmatically. It sounds like what you want, though, is a regular task queue task, which behaves exactly as described.
