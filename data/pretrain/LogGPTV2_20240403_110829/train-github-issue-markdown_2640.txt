    - What does 'go version' print?
    go version devel +b3abbfe35b6f Thu Sep 04 23:14:21 2014 -0400 linux/amd64
    - What steps reproduce the problem?
    This (correctly) doesn't compile:
        _ = map[string]string{
            "aap": "noot",
            "aap": "mies",
        }   
    With a 'duplicate key "aap" in map literal' error.
    This does, though:
        type t struct {
            b string
        }
        _ = map[t]string{
            t{
                b: "1.2.3.4",
            }: "probe1",
            t{
                b: "1.2.3.5",
            }: "client1",
            t{
                b: "1.2.3.5", // Duplicate!
            }: "client1",
        }
    Both are on http://play.golang.org/p/clJ4G8CbcQ
    - What should have happened instead?
    Would be great if the fancy key version also doesn't compile.
