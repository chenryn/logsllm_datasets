From this discourse thread. Here is what I was trying:
    macro color_output(enabled, block)
        quote
            prev_color = Base.have_color
            eval(Base, :(have_color = $$enabled))
            $(esc(block))
            eval(Base, :(have_color = $prev_color))
        end
    end
In a nested quotenode, you can use `$$var` to access `var` in the outer scope,
and I'd expect to be able to use `$var` to access one level up, but it doesn't
seem to work.
