### Log Summary

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:06 to 18:06:11 on October 18th, documents several recurring issues and events in a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step summary of the key points:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple warnings indicate address changes for both the `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000) and `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030). The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:<port>`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:<port>`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times. The failure duration increases from 69 seconds to 73 seconds over the span of the log. Each time, it indicates that a retry will be attempted shortly.

3. **Connection Retries to ResourceManager (RM)**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. It retries the connection with a policy of up to 10 retries, each with a 1-second interval.
   - Errors are logged when the `RMContainerAllocator` fails to contact the ResourceManager.

4. **Task Progress Updates**:
   - Two task attempts report their progress:
     - `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` reports a progress of 0.37551183.
     - `attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0` reports a progress of 0.38137424.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **10-18 18:06:06 to 18:06:11**:
  - **LeaseRenewer**:
    - Repeatedly detects address changes and fails to renew the lease, with the failure duration increasing by one second each time.
  - **RMCommunicator Allocator**:
    - Detects address changes and attempts to connect to the ResourceManager, logging errors when it fails.
  - **Task Attempt Listener**:
    - Reports the progress of two specific task attempts.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with network address changes and lease renewals, as well as intermittent connectivity problems with the ResourceManager. The system is attempting to handle these issues by retrying operations, but the failures persist. Additionally, the log includes updates on the progress of two specific tasks, which appear to be running normally.
