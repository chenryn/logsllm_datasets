“Unmanned Advanced Capability Aircraft and Ground Combat Vehicles
It shall be a goal of the Armed Forces to achieve the fielding of unmanned, remotely controlled technology 
such that by 2015, one-third of the operational ground combat vehicles of the Armed Forces are unmanned.”
—National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (S. 2549, Sec. 217)

Civil Applications
• Priorities:
• Precision Agriculture
• Self-Driving Cars
• Roadblocks:
• Shared Infrastructure 
(Airspace, Roads)
• Acceptance (Safety, 
Robustness)
• Let’s Talk Failure!
Classic Failures
RQ-3 DarkStar
$10m Unit Procurement Cost (Units 11-20, 1994 $)
On its second flight, due to a software fault in the flight control system the aircraft's porpoising 
oscillations increased to a nose-high stall as it left the ground and the vehicle crashed.
—International Journal of Unmanned Systems Engineering, Vol. 1, No. S3, 1–5
• Expectations of the designers are critical!
• Exploitation happens at expectation boundary “cracks”
Classic Failures
Sandstorm

•
Deciding what the robot “knows” is a constant battle
•
Correct state estimation is key to decision making
•
Successful exploits will most likely subvert state estimation
Autonomous Vehicle Logic Structures
Activity Hierarchy
Control Loops, Stability Maintenance
Collision Avoidance
Navigation & Localization
Mission Task Planners/Reasoners
•
Attacks lower in the stack defeat everything above
•
More engineering effort spent on guaranteed robustness at lower levels
•
Lower layers may be juicier but harder targets

Sensors
•
Active vs Passive
•
Common sensors:
•
GPS
•
LIDAR
•
Cameras
•
Millimeter Wave Radar
•
Digital Compass
•
IMU
•
Wheel Encoders
•
Doppler Velocity Logger (subsurface)
•
Scanning SONAR (subsurface)
•
Pressure Transducers (air & subsurface)
Sensors
•
Sources of uncertainty:
•
Noise
•
Drift
•
Latency & update rate
•
Uncertainty must be modeled under assumptions
•
Sensor fusion:
•
Fused/registered data can be more useful than separate
•
What to do when sensors disagree?
•
Robot robustness may come down to:
•
How smart is it at discounting 1 bad/spoofed sensor?
Sensor Attacks
•
2 kinds:
•
Denial
•
Preventing sensor from recovering useful data
•
Spooﬁng
•
Causing sensor to retrieve speciﬁcally incorrect data
•
Basic attack mode choice:
•
Attack sensors directly
•
Attack aggregated sensor data
GPS
• Denial:
• Jamming
• Spooﬁng:
• Fake GPS satellite signals at higher power
GPS
UT Austin Radionavigation Laboratory
LIDAR
•
Originally industrial monitoring sensors
•
Mechanically scanned operation
•
Primarily for collision avoidance & map building
•
Denial:
•
Active overpowering
•
Preventing return signal
•
Spooﬁng:
•
Manipulating absorbence/reﬂectivity
LIDAR
• 2D sensor highly orientation dependent
• Inclines can look like obstacles
• May miss low obstacles & discontinuities
LIDAR
• Active emission sensor
• Can only see what returns a signal
• No return = nothing there
• Most of the world returns no data
LIDAR
• Absorbent things look like nothing
• Also transparent
LIDAR
• Reﬂective things can confuse laser
• Faraway things brought near
• Loss of return looks like ditch

The Map
•

Map dependence may exacerbate brittleness of discrimination rules
The Map
•
Map requires constant updates
•
Local map:
•
Vulnerable to unexpected real world features
•
Remote map:
•
Vulnerable to denial (4G jamming)
•
Vulnerable to spooﬁng (MITM attack, standard cellular intercept techniques)
