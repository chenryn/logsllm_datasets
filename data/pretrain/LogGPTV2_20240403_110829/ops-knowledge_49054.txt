User:  When running a virtual machine, how do I assign a static IP address to the virtual machine?
Assistant: The following are the steps to assign a static IP address to a virtual machine: 1. Open the virtual machine software and enter the virtual machine setting interface. 2. Under the Network Adapters tab, set the network connection method to Bridge Mode and select an available physical network card. 3. Under the Advanced tab, find and record the MAC address of the virtual machine. 4. Open the control panel on the host machine, select "Network and Sharing Center", and click "Change Adapter Settings" in the left menu. 5. Find the network connection corresponding to the physical network card used by the virtual machine, right-click and select "Properties". 6. Find "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" in the pop-up window, and click the "Properties" button. 7. Select the "Use the following IP address" option and fill in the corresponding static IP address, subnet mask and default gateway. DNS server can fill in the host or other available DNS servers. 8. Under the "Advanced" button, select "Add", fill in the MAC address of the virtual machine as a static ARP entry, save and close all windows. 9. Restart the network service in the virtual machine to ensure that the virtual machine is properly connected to the network. After completing the above steps, the virtual machine is assigned a static IP address. It should be noted that the IP address of each virtual machine should be unique and cannot conflict with the IP addresses of other hosts or virtual machines. It is recommended to allocate IP addresses in advance during network planning to avoid conflicts and confusion.
