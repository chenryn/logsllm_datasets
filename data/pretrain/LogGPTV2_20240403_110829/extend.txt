### Extend Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `extend` command is used to expand the volume or partition with focus and its file system into available unallocated space on a disk.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
extend [size=<size>] [disk=<disk>] [noerr]
extend filesystem [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **size=\<size>**: Specifies the amount of space in megabytes (MB) to add to the current volume or partition. If no size is specified, all contiguous free space on the disk will be used.
- **disk=\<disk>**: Specifies the disk on which the volume or partition is to be extended. If no disk is specified, the extension will occur on the current disk.
- **filesystem**: Extends the file system of the volume with focus. This option is only applicable if the file system was not extended with the volume.
- **noerr**: For scripting purposes. When an error occurs, DiskPart will continue processing commands as if the error did not happen. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Remarks:**

- **Basic Disks:** The unallocated space must be on the same disk as the volume or partition with focus and must immediately follow the volume or partition (i.e., it must start at the next sector offset).
- **Dynamic Disks (Simple or Spanned Volumes):** A volume can be extended to any free space on any dynamic disk. This command can also convert a simple dynamic volume into a spanned dynamic volume. However, mirrored, RAID-5, and striped volumes cannot be extended.
- **File System Considerations:**
  - If the partition was previously formatted with the NTFS file system, the file system will automatically extend to fill the larger partition without data loss.
  - If the partition was formatted with a file system other than NTFS, the command will fail, and no changes will be made to the partition.
  - If the partition was not previously formatted with a file system, the partition will still be extended.
- **Volume Requirement:** The partition must have an associated volume before it can be extended.

**Examples:**

- To extend the volume or partition with focus by 500 MB on disk 3:
  ```plaintext
  extend size=500 disk=3
  ```

- To extend the file system of a volume after it has been extended:
  ```plaintext
  extend filesystem
  ```

This command is particularly useful for managing disk space and ensuring that your partitions and volumes are optimally sized for your needs.
