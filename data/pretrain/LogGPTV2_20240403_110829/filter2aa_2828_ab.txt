# Malware and Phishing Infrastructure Analysis

## Overview
- **Madness Pro**: A phishing tool.
- **Pony Panel**: Serves various Zeus URLs, including configurations, binaries, and drop zones.
- **Abused TLDs**: .ru, .su, and .com are the most frequently abused top-level domains (TLDs).
- **Geographical Concentration**:
  - Bots are primarily concentrated in Russia and Ukraine.
  - Targeted victims are mainly in the United States.

## DNS and IP-Based Malware Detection
### DNS Style
- **Catching Malware via DNS**:
  - Monitor and blacklist malicious domains and IPs from network traffic.
  - Study sub-allocated IP ranges and fingerprints.
  - Analyze bad actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in infrastructure selection.
  - Predictively block IPs designated for attacks.
  - Generalize predictions to other threats.
  - Track shifts in bad actors' TTPs over time.

### IP Style
- **Catching Malware via IP**:
  - Use case #1: Malicious sub-allocated ranges.
  - Investigate process:
    - Monitor domains and IPs from traffic and blacklist them.
    - Study sub-allocated IP ranges and fingerprints.
    - Examine bad actors' TTPs in their choice of infrastructure.
    - Predictively block IPs designed for attacks.
    - Generalize predictions.
    - Study shifts in bad actors' TTPs.

## OVH Case Study
- **OVH Canada and Ukraine**:
  - Same customer reserving IPs.
  - IPs exclusively used for attacks.
  - Bringing IPs online in bulk or one at a time.
  - Customer unknown.
  - Using contiguous IPs online in a random or sequential manner.
  - Name servers always stayed on OVH IP ranges.

- **Time Period Analysis**:
  - December 1-31, 2013: 28 ranges, 136 IPs, 86 used (63% malicious).
  - January 1-31, 2014: 11 ranges, 80 IPs, 33 used (41% malicious).
  - February 1-28, 2014: 4 ranges, 28 IPs, 26 used (92% malicious).
  - March 1-20, 2014: 43 ranges, 364 IPs, 215 used (59% malicious).

- **IP Ranges**:
  - 86 ranges in specific prefixes:
    - 388: 198.50.128.0/17
    - 128: 192.95.0.0/18
    - 80: 198.27.64.0/18
    - 12: 142.4.192.0/19

- **Fingerprinting Malicious Ranges**:
  - Example: 31.41.221.131 - 31.41.221.143
    - Open ports: 22/tcp (OpenSSH 5.5p1), 80/tcp (nginx 0.7.67), 111/tcp (rpcbind)
  - Example: 5.101.173.1 - 5.101.173.10
    - Open ports: 22/tcp (OpenSSH 6.0p1), 80/tcp (nginx 1.2.1), 111/tcp (rpcbind)

## Detecting Malicious Subdomains
- **Investigation Process**:
  - Detect subdomains injected under compromised domains.
  - Collect subdomains, domains, and hosting IPs.
  - Track most abused ASNs and hosters.
  - Study the evolution of bad actors' TTPs over time.
  - Analyze subdomain labels.

- **Malicious Subdomains**:
  - Injected under compromised domains, notably GoDaddy domains.
  - Serve exploit kits (e.g., Nuclear, Angler, FlashPack), browlock, and malvertising.
  - Various payloads dropped (e.g., zbot variants, kuluoz).
  - Monitoring patterns for 5+ months (February 2014 - present).

- **Top 5 Abused ASNs**:
  - 16276: OVH SAS (18% of total collected malicious IPs)
  - 24961: myLoc managed IT AG
  - 15003: Nobis Technology Group, LLC
  - 41853: LLC NTCOM
  - 20473: Choopa, LLC

## Shift in Bad Actors' TTPs
- **Before**:
  - Abuse ccTLDs (e.g., .pw, .in.net, .ru) using rogue/victim resellers/registrars.
  - Use reserved IPs exclusively for exploit kit and browlock attacks.
  - Bring attack IPs online in contiguous chunks.
  - Abuse OVH Canada: possible to predictively correlate rogue customers with attack IPs through ARIN rwhois.

- **Now**:
  - Supplement with abusing compromised domains.
  - Use recycled IPs that hosted legitimate content in the past.
  - Bring IPs up in randomized sets or one at a time.
  - Abuse OVH Europe spanning numerous countries' IP pools (e.g., FRA, BEL, ITA, UK, IRE, ESP, POR, GER, NED, FIN, CZE, RUS).

## Small Abused or Rogue Hosting Providers
- **Examples**:
  - [king-servers.com](http://king-servers.com/en/): Hosted Angler, Styx, porn, and pharma.
  - [evrohoster.ru](http://evrohoster.ru/en/): Hosted browlock through redirects from porn sites.
  - [qhoster.bg](http://www.qhoster.bg/): Hosted Nuclear.
  - [electrickiven.com](http://www.electrickiven.com/web-hosting/): 
  - [xlhost.com](http://www.xlhost.com/): Hosted Angler EK domains.
  - [ubiquityhosting.com](https://www.ubiquityhosting.com/): Hosted browlock.
  - [codero.com](http://www.codero.com/)
  - [hostink.ru](http://hostink.ru/)

## String Analysis of Injected Subdomains
- **Sample**:
  - 19,000+ malicious subdomains injected under 4,200+ compromised GoDaddy domains.
  - 12,000+ different labels.
  - Top 5 used labels: police, alertpolice, css, windowsmoviemaker, solidfileslzsr.

## Internet and BGP Basics
- **Network of Networks**:
  - Each organization on the Internet is called an Autonomous System (AS).
  - Each dot represents an AS, identified by a number (e.g., OpenDNS: 36692, Google: 15169).
  - Each AS has one or more prefixes (e.g., 36692 has 56 IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes).
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the glue that makes this work.

### AS Graph
- **Data Sources**:
  - Routeviews: [archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/](http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/)
  - Cidr Report: [www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/](http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/)
  - Hurricane Electric database: [bgp.he.net/](http://bgp.he.net/)

- **Building the AS Graph**:
  - Directed graph: node = ASN, directed edge from an ASN to an upstream ASN.
  - Example: `TABLE_DUMP2|1392422403|B|96.4.0.55|11686|67.215.94.0/24|11686 4436 2914 36692|IGP|96.4.0.55|0|0||NAG||`
