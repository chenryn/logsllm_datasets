User: I have several two python on my mac, one is original, and another is downloaded on the website, when I open the python in terminal, how can I decide which I'm opening? Thanks for help.
Assistant: Also, if you just need to know which installation of Python is the system using, the way to do it is typing which python at the terminal.
