I have two versions of Python installed on my Mac: one is the original version that came with the system, and the other was downloaded from a website. When I open Python in the terminal, how can I determine which version I am using? 

Additionally, if you just need to know which installation of Python the system is using, you can type `which python` in the terminal.

Thank you for your help.
